{"id":18755,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII A CIRCLE IN THE SAND","content":"I HAVE since thought it almost providential that my food supply was so limited; for, after first asking me if I had eaten all I required, she fell upon it like a famished thing, and did not desist until all was gone. A threatening bank of dark cloud was creeping slowly up the northern sky as we were resting, but directly overhead the stars were shining brilliantly, yielding me sufficient light for the study of her face. She was certainly less than my own age by two or three years, a girl barely rounding into the slender beauty of her earliest womanhood, with hints of both in face and form. She was simply dressed, as, indeed, might naturally be expected in a wilderness far removed from marts of trade; but her clothing was of excellent texture, and became her well in spite of its recent exposure, while a bit of rather expensive ? 67 ? lace at the throat and a flutter of gay ribbons about the wrists told plainly that she did not disdain the usual adornments of her sex. And this was quickly shown in another way. She had not yet completed her frugal meal when her mind reverted to her personal appearance, and she paused, with heightened color, to draw back her loosened hair and fasten it in place with a knot of scarlet cord. It was surely a winsome face that smiled up at me then. \"I feel almost guilty of robbery,\" she said, \"in taking all this food, which was no doubt intended for your own supper.\" \"Merely what chanced to be left of it,\" I answered heartily. \"Had I so much as dreamed this stretch of sand was to yield me such companionship, I should have stinted myself more.\" An expression of bewildered surprise crept into her eyes as I spoke. \"Surely you are not a mere coureur de bois, as I supposed from your dress,\" she exclaimed. \"Your expression is that of an educated gentleman.\" I smiled; for I was young enough to feel the force of her unconscious flattery. \"I believe I can prove descent from an old and honorable race,\" I said; \"but it has been my fortune to be reared in the backwoods, and whatever education has come to me I owe to the love and skill of my mother.\" ? 68 ? My frankness pleased her, and she made no attempt to disguise her interest. \"I am so glad you told me,\" she said simply. \"My mother died when I was only ten, yet her memory has always been an inspiration. Are you a Protestant?\" This unexpected question took me by surprise; yet I answered unhesitatingly, \"Yes.\" \"I was educated at the Ursuline Convent in Montreal. It was my mother\u0027s dearest wish that I should take the vows of that order, but I fear I am far too frivolous for so serious a life. I love happy things too well, and the beautiful outside world of men and women. I ran away from the Sisters, and then my father and I voyaged to this country, where we might lead a freer life together.\" \"Here?\" and I glanced questioningly about me into those darkening shadows which were momentarily hemming us in more closely. \"To Fort Dearborn,\" she explained. \"We came by boat through the straits at the north; and \u0027twas a trip to remember. My father brought out goods from Canada, and traded with the Indians. I have been in their villages. Once I was a week alone with a tribe of Sacs near Green Bay, and they called me the White Queen. I have met many famous warriors of the Wyandots and Pottawattomies, and have seen them dance at their council. Once I journeyed as far ? 69 ? west as the Great River, across leagues and leagues of prairie,\" and her face lighted up at the remembrance. \"Father said he thought I must be the first white woman who had ever travelled so far inland. We have been at Dearborn for nearly a year.\" She rose to her feet, and swept her eyes, with some anxiety, around upon dim mounds of sand that appeared more fantastic than ever in the darkness. \"Had we not better be going?\" she asked. \"There is surely a storm gathering yonder.\" \"Yes,\" I answered, for I had not been indifferent to the clouds steadily banking up in the north. \"Yet you have not told me your name, and I should be most glad to know it.\" The girl courtesied mockingly, as though half inclined to laugh at my insistence. \"What is a name?\" she exclaimed. \"\u0027Tis not that for which we greatly care. Now I—I am simply Mademoiselle Antoinette,—at least, so most of those I care for call me; and from now on, the very good friend of Master John Wayland.\" I was deeply conscious that I blushed at her words and manner; but with it there arose an instant query in my mind: could this be the fair Toinette whom De Croix sought so ardently? I greatly feared it; yet I resolved I would not mention his name to her. \"It has a decided French sound,\" I stammered. ? 70 ? She laughed at my tone, with a quick shrug of her shoulders. \"And pray, why not, Monsieur? Have you such a prejudice against that great people that you need speak of them with so glum a voice? Ah, but if I must, then I shall endeavor to teach you a higher regard for us.\" \"That may not prove so hard a task,\" I hastened to assure her; \"though I was surprised,—you speak English with so pure an accent that I had not dreamed you other than of my own race.\" \"My father was of English blood,\" she answered more gravely; \"but I fear you will find me quite of my mother\u0027s people, if ever we come to know each other well. But hark! that was surely thunder! We have loitered too long; the storm is about to break.\" It was indeed upon us almost before she ceased speaking. A sudden rush of wind sent my hat flying into the darkness, and whipped her long black hair loose from its restraining knot. I had barely time to wrap my hunting-jacket closely around her shoulders, when the rain came dashing against our faces. I drew her unresistingly around the edge of the nearest sand-pile; but this supplied poor protection against the storm, the wind lashing the fine grit into our faces, stinging us like bits of fire. I tried to excavate ? 71 ? some sort of cave that might afford us at least a partial shelter; but the sand slid down almost as rapidly as I could dig it out with my hands. \"Oh, let us press on!\" she urged, laying her hand upon my arm in entreaty. \"We shall become no wetter moving, and your camp, you said, was only a short distance away.\" \"But are you strong enough to walk?\" And as I leaned forward toward her, a quick flash of vivid lightning, directly overhead, lit both our faces. I marked she did not shrink, and no look of fear came into her eyes. \"I am quite myself once more,\" she answered confidently. \"It was despair and loneliness that so disheartened me. I have never been timid physically, and your presence has brought back the courage I needed.\" There was a natural frankness, a peculiar confidence, about this girl, that robbed me of my usual diffidence; and as we struggled forward through the dampening sand, her dress clinging about her and retarding progress, I dared to slip one arm about her waist to help in bearing her along. She accepted this timely aid in the spirit with which it was offered, without so much as a word of protest; and the wind, battering at our backs, pushed us forward. \"Oh, that troublesome hair!\" she exclaimed, as the long tresses whipped in front of our faces, blinding ? 72 ? us both. \"I have never before felt so much like sacrificing it.\" \"I beg that you will not consider such an act now,\" I protested, aiding her to reclaim the truants, \"for as I saw it before the darkness fell, your hair was surely worthy of preservation.\" \"You laugh at me; I know I must have been a far from pretty sight.\" \"Do you wish me to say with frankness what I thought of your appearance under such disadvantages?\" She glanced at me almost archly, in the flash of lightning that rent the sky. \"I am really afraid to answer yes,—yet perhaps I am brave enough to venture it.\" \"I have never been at court, Mademoiselle, and so you may not consider my judgment in such matters of much moment; but I thought you rarely beautiful.\" For a moment she did not attempt to speak, but I could distinctly feel the heaving of her bosom as I held her hard against the assault of the wind, and bent low hoping to catch an answer. \"You are sincere and honest,\" she said at last, slowly, and I felt that the faint trace of mockery had utterly vanished from her soft voice. \"\u0027Tis manifest in your face and words. You speak not lightly, nor with mere empty compliment, as would some gilded ? 73 ? courtiers I have known; and for that reason I do value your opinion.\" \"You are not angry at my presumption?\" \"Angry?—I?\" and she stopped and faced me, holding back her hair as she did so. \"I am a woman, Monsieur; and all women, even those of us hidden here in the wilderness, like best those who admire them. I do not know that I am as beautiful as you say, yet other men have often said the same without being pressed for their opinion. No, I am not angry,—I am even glad to know you think so.\" \"And you surely do know?\" I insisted, with a courage strange to me. \"Yes,\" she answered, but her eyes fell before my eagerness; \"you are not one who has yet learned to lie, even to women. \u0027Tis a relief to know there are such men still in the world.\" We had come to a full halt by this time. \"Do you have any idea where we may be?\" she asked, peering anxiously about, and perhaps glad to change the tone of our conversation. \"I cannot note a landmark of any kind. These sand-hills seem all alike.\" \"I believe we have kept to the southward, for we have merely drifted with the storm; but I confess my sole guidance has been the direction of the wind, as these sand-lanes are most confusing. If there were the slightest shelter at hand, I should insist upon your waiting until the rain was over.\" ? 74 ? \"No, it is better to go on. I am now wet to the skin, and shall be warmer moving than resting on this damp sand.\" We must have been moving for an hour, scarcely speaking a word, for the severe exertion required all our breath. The rain had ceased, and stars began to glimmer amid the cloud-rifts overhead; but I knew now that we were lost. She stopped suddenly, and sank down upon the sand. \"I am exhausted,\" she admitted, \"and believe we are merely moving about in a circle.\" \"Yes,\" I said, reluctantly; \"we are wasting our strength to no purpose. \u0027T will be better to wait for daylight here.\" It was a gloomy place, and the silence of those vast expanses of desolate sand was overwhelming. It oppressed me strangely. \"Let me feel the touch of your hand,\" she said once. \"It is so desperately lonely. I have been on the wide prairie, at night and alone; yet there is always some sound there upon which the mind may rest. Here the stillness is like a weight.\" Possibly I felt this depressing influence the more because of my long forest training, where at least the moaning of limbs, fluttering of leaves, or flitting of birds brings relief to the expectant senses; while here all was absolute solitude, so profound that our breathing itself was startling. The air above appeared ? 75 ? empty and void; the earth beneath, lifeless and dead. Although neither of us was cowardly of heart, yet we instinctively drew closer together, and our eyes strained anxiously over the black sand-ridges, now barely discernible through the dense gloom. We tried to talk, but even that soon grew to be a struggle, so heavily did the suspense rest upon our spirits, so oppressed were we by imaginings of evil. I remember telling her my simple story, gaining in return brief glimpses of her experiences in Canada and the farther West. She even informed me that orders had been received, the day before she became lost upon the lake, to abandon Fort Dearborn; that an Indian runner—whom she named Winnemeg had arrived from General Hull at Detroit, bringing also news that Mackinac had fallen. \"Doubtless your absence has greatly worried them also,\" I said. \"Oh, no; none of them knew my plight. Possibly some may miss me, but they will naturally suppose I have been at Mr. Kinzie\u0027s house all this time. I have been there often for weeks together, and they have frequently urged me to take shelter with them. You see it is far safer there than at the Fort, for even the most hostile Indians remain on friendly terms with Mr. Kinzie and his family. He has been there so many years, and is so just a man in his dealings with them. \u0027Tis really strange to see how he leaves ? 76 ? his house unguarded, while the garrison at the Fort is almost in a state of siege. It makes it hard to realize how imminent is the danger. Yet they are terribly alarmed at the Fort, and I fear with cause. Even Mr. Kinzie feels the situation to be critical. There were fully three hundred Pottawattomie warriors encamped without the Fort two days ago; and they were becoming bold and impudent,—one chief even firing his gun in Captain Heald\u0027s office, thinking to frighten him into furnishing them with liquor.\" \"But the Fort is strong?\" I asked. \"It is capable of resisting an attack?\" \"I should suppose so,\" she answered, hesitatingly; \"but that is not a matter upon which a girl may judge. I fear, however, all is not harmony among its defenders. I know that Captain Heald and Ensign Ronan do not agree, and I have heard bitter words spoken by other officers of the garrison.\" I thought she did not care to speak more about this matter, and we drifted off upon other topics, until I felt her head sink slowly down upon my shoulder, and knew she slept. I sat there still, pillowing her tenderly upon my arm, when the gray light of the dawn stole slowly toward us across the ridges of sand and revealed the upturned face. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3196/87349.html","bookId":838,"book":{"id":838,"title":"When Wilderness was King","description":"简介： S URELY it was no longer ago than yesterday.
