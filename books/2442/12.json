{"id":79313,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I wanted to speak to the Princes directly - but I couldn\u0027t just march up to the doors of the Hall and ask the guards to let me in! I could wait for one of the Princes to emerge and hail him, but they didn\u0027t leave the throne room very often. What if Kurda made his move before I could act? I thought about sneaking down to the doors and slipping in the next time they were open, but it was unlikely that I could avoid the attention of the guards. Besides, if Kurda was inside and saw me, he might kill me before I had a chance to speak. That was my greatest fear - that I\u0027d be killed before I warned the Princes of the peril they faced. With this in mind, I decided I had to contact somebody before approaching the Princes, so that if I died, my message wouldn\u0027t die with me. But who to trust? Mr. Crepsley or Harkat were the ideal choices, but there was no way I could make it to their cells undetected. Arra Sails and Vanez Blane also dwelt too deep within the mountain to be easily reached. That left Seba Nile, the ancient quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. His cell was close to the storerooms. It would be risky, but I thought I could get to him without being seen. But could I trust him? He and Kurda were close friends. He\u0027d helped the traitor make maps of infrequently used tunnels, maps that the vampaneze might be using at this very minute to advance on the Hall of Princes. Was it possible that he was one of Kurda\u0027s allies? Almost as soon as I raised the question, I knew it was ridiculous. Seba was an old-fashioned vampire, who believed in loyalty and the ways of the vampires above all else. And he\u0027d been Mr. Crepsley\u0027s mentor. If I couldn\u0027t trust Seba, I couldn\u0027t trust anybody. I rose to go in search of Seba, and the wolves rose with me. Crouching, I told them to stay. Streak shook his head, growling, but I was firm with him. \"Stay!\" I commanded. \"Wait for me. If I don\u0027t come back, return to the pack. This isn\u0027t your fight. There\u0027s nothing you can do.\" I wasn\u0027t sure if Streak understood all that, but he squatted on his haunches and remained with the other wolves, panting heavily as he watched me leave, his dark eyes fixed on me until I vanished around a bend. Retracing the path by which we\u0027d come, I climbed back down the mountain. It didn\u0027t take long to reach the storerooms. They were quiet when I arrived, but I entered cautiously, taking no chances, through the hole that Kurda had revealed to me during my escape. Finding nobody within, I started for the door leading to the tunnels, then stopped and glanced down at myself. I\u0027d grown so used to being naked, I\u0027d forgotten how strange I\u0027d look to nonanimal eyes. If I turned up in Seba\u0027s quarters like this, dirty and wild, he might think I was a ghost! There were no spare clothes in this room, so I ripped apart an old sack and tied a strip of it around my waist. It wasn\u0027t much of an improvement, but it would have to do. I tied another few strips around my feet, so that I could pad more stealthily, then opened a sack of flour and rubbed a few handfuls of the white powder over my body, hopefully to mask the worst of my wolfish smell. When I was ready, I opened the door and crept into the tunnel. Though it would normally have taken no more than two or three minutes to get to Seba\u0027s rooms, I spent nearly four times as long, checking each stretch of tunnel several times before venturing down it, making sure I had somewhere to hide if vampires emerged unexpectedly. When I finally reached the old quartermaster\u0027s door, I was shaking with anxiety and stood in silence a few seconds, collecting myself. When I\u0027d recovered, I knocked lightly. \"Come in,\" Seba called. I entered. The quartermaster was standing by a chest with his back to me. \"Over here, Thomas,\" he muttered, examining the inside of the chest. \"I told you not to bother knocking. The investiture is a mere two hours away. We do not have time for -? Turning, he saw me, and his jaw literally dropped. \"Hello, Seba.\" I smiled nervously. Seba blinked, shook his head, blinked again. \"Darren?\" he gasped. \"The one and only.\" I grinned. Seba lowered the lid of the chest and sat upon it heavily. \"Are you a vision?\" he wheezed. \"Do I look like one?\" \"Yes,\" he said. I laughed and advanced. \"I\u0027m no vision, Seba. It\u0027s me. I\u0027m real.\" I stopped in front of him. \"Feel me if you don\u0027t believe me.\" Seba reached out a trembling finger and touched my left arm. When he realized I was solid, he beamed and rose. Then his face fell, and he sat again. \"You were sentenced to death,\" he said dolefully. \"I figured as much,\" I said, nodding. \"You fled.\" \"It was a mistake. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"We thought you drowned. Your trail led to the stream and ended abruptly. How did you get out?\" \"I swam,\" I said lightly. \"Swam where?\" he asked. \"Down the stream.\" \"You mean... all the way... through the mountain? That is impossible!\" \"Improbable,\" I corrected him. \"Not impossible. I wouldn\u0027t be here if it was.\" \"And Gavner?\" he asked hopefully. \"Is he alive too?\" I shook my head sadly. \"Gavner\u0027s dead. He was murdered.\" \"I thought so,\" Seba sighed. \"But when I saw you, I -\" He stopped and frowned. \"Murdered?\" he rumbled. \"You\u0027d better stay sitting,\" I said, then proceeded to tell him the bare bones of my encounter with the vampaneze, Kurda\u0027s treachery, and what happened after. Seba was shaking with rage when I finished. \"Never did I think a vampire would turn against his brothers,\" he growled. \"And one so highly respected! It sickens and shames me. To think I have drunk blood to that sham of a vampire\u0027s good health and prayed to the gods to grant him luck! Charna\u0027s guts!\" \"You believe me?\" I asked, relieved. \"I might not recognize treachery when it is skillfully concealed,\" he said, \"but I know the truth when it is revealed. I believe you. The Princes will too.\" Rising, he strode for the door. \"We must hurry to warn them. The sooner we -\" He paused. \"No. The Princes will see no one until the time of investiture. They reside within their Hall and will not open the doors until twilight, when Kurda presents himself. That is the way it has always been. I would be turned away if I went there now.\" \"But you\u0027ll be able to get to them in time?\" I asked anxiously. He nodded. \"There is a lengthy ceremony before the investiture. I will have plenty of time to interrupt and level these grievous charges against our supposed ally, Kurda Smahlt.\" The vampire was seething with rage. \"Come to think of it,\" he said, eyes narrowing, \"he is alone in his chambers now. I could go and slit the villain\u0027s throat before-\" \"No,\" I said quickly. \"The Princes will want to question him. We don\u0027t know who else is working with them, or why he did it.\" \"You are right,\" he sighed, shoulders slumping. \"Besides, killing him would be a mercy. He deserves to suffer for what he did to Gavner.\" \"That\u0027s not the only reason why I don\u0027t want you to kill him,\" I said hesitantly. Seba stared at me and waited for me to continue. \"I want to blow the whistle on him. I was with Gavner when he died. He was down in the tunnels because of me. I want to look into Kurda\u0027s eyes when I expose him.\" \"To show him how much you hate him?\" Seba asked. \"No,\" I said. \"To show him how much pain he\u0027s caused.\" There were tears in my eyes. \"I hate him, Seba, but I still think of him as a friend. He saved my life. I\u0027d be dead now if he hadn\u0027t intervened. I want him to know how much he\u0027s hurt me. Maybe it doesn\u0027t make sense, but I want him to see that I don\u0027t get any pleasure out of exposing him as a traitor.\" Seba nodded slowly. \"It makes sense,\" he said, stroking his chin and considering the proposal. \"But it is dangerous. I do not think the guards will kill you, but one of Kurda\u0027s allies might.\" \"I\u0027ll take that chance,\" I said. \"What do I have to lose? I\u0027ll be killed afterward anyway, because I failed the Trials. I\u0027d rather die on my feet, stopping Kurda, than in the Hall of Death.\" Seba smiled warmly. \"You are a true, courageous vampire, Darren Shan,\" he said. \"No,\" I replied softly. \"I\u0027m just trying to do the right thing, to make up for running away earlier.\" \"Larten will be proud of you,\" Seba remarked. I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say to that, so I just blushed and shrugged. Then we sat down together and discussed various plans for the night ahead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-prince-the-saga-of-darren-shan-6/page-12.html","bookId":2442,"book":{"id":2442,"title":"The Vampire Prince (The Saga of Darren Shan #6)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #6: The Vampire Prince The book carries on from when Darren Shan was falling down a huge waterfall in Trials of Death, and he must make his way back to Vampire Mountain, while avoiding Kurda Smahlt and his accomplices.
