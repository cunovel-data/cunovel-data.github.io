{"id":79305,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Consciousness returns gradually.Sounds strike me first: the roar of the water, much softer than in the mountain, almost lyrical. Slowly, my eyes flutter open. I\u0027m staring up at stars, drifting along on my back. Luck or my body\u0027s natural defenses? I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m alive! The current isn\u0027t strong here. I could easily swim to the bank, pull myself to safety, and begin the trip back to Vampire Mountain, which I see in the distance. Except I don\u0027t have the strength. I try rolling over to swim - can\u0027t. My legs and arms are like dead blocks of wood. I\u0027ve survived the ride through the mountain, but the cost has been high. I\u0027m completely limp and helpless. I study the landscape while the stream sweeps me further away from Vampire Mountain. It\u0027s rugged and unspectacular, but beautiful after the darkness. Anything would seem beautiful after the darkness. I\u0027ll never take the countryside for granted again. Am I dying? I could be - no feeling, no control, at the mercy of the stream. Maybe I\u0027m dead already and just haven\u0027t realized it. No! Not dead. Water splashes up my nose and I splutter: proof I\u0027m still alive. I won\u0027t give up, not after all I\u0027ve been through. I have to find strength to make it to the bank. I can\u0027t drift along like this forever: the longer it drags on, the harder it will be. I try willing energy into my exhausted limbs. I think about dying young and what a waste it would be, but that doesn\u0027t give me strength. I think about the vampires and the threat they face from Kurda and the vampaneze, but that doesn\u0027t work either. Finally, an old vampire myth succeeds in spreading a burst of fire through my icy bones: I recall the myth that a vampire who dies in running water is doomed to stick around as a ghost - no journey to Paradise for those who die in rivers or streams. Strangely (as I never believed the myth), the thought spurs me into action. I raise a weak arm and flap feebly for the bank. The action doesn\u0027t do much, apart from spin me around a little, but the fact that I\u0027m able to move at all fills me with hope. Gritting my teeth, I face the bank and force my legs up behind me. They respond sluggishly, but they do respond. I try to swim freestyle - can\u0027t. I roll over onto my back, kick weakly with my feet, and guide myself with gentle hand motions. I slowly pull toward the bank. It takes a long time, and I\u0027m swept much further away from Vampire Mountain, but finally I\u0027m in shallow water, out of the current. I half rise to my knees, then collapse. Lying facedown, I turn my head sideways, splutter, then get back on my knees. I crawl out of the water onto the snowy bank, where I collapse again. My eyes close. I weep silently into the snow. I want to lie here and freeze: simpler than moving. But my feet are still in the water and I don\u0027t like the feel of them drifting behind me, so I pull them out. The effort goads me into further action. Groaning, I brace myself, then rise slowly and painfully to my feet. Standing, I stare around as if I\u0027m on an alien planet. Everything looks different. Day is breaking, but stars and the moon still shine lightly in the sky. After so long inside the mountain, I\u0027d forgotten what daylight looks like. It\u0027s wonderful. I could stand here all day and just stare, except that wouldn\u0027t get me anywhere, and soon I\u0027d fall, into the stream or the snow, and freeze. Sighing, obeying some insistent inner instinct, I drag my feet forward a few steps, pause, shake my head, straighten up, and lurch away from the stream, which froths and hisses angrily behind me - cheated of its victim.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-prince-the-saga-of-darren-shan-6/page-4.html","bookId":2442,"book":{"id":2442,"title":"The Vampire Prince (The Saga of Darren Shan #6)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #6: The Vampire Prince The book carries on from when Darren Shan was falling down a huge waterfall in Trials of Death, and he must make his way back to Vampire Mountain, while avoiding Kurda Smahlt and his accomplices.
