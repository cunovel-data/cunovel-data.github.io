{"id":28241,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI ROUGH TRAVELLING","content":"Carter was away two hours, and he returned, carrying a prime joint of beef. \"I was lucky in finding an animal that was lying down. I[Pg 76] stalked him from behind, and came upon him before he could spring on to his feet and get into motion.\" \"That is good indeed,\" Nita said, \"but what have you done with the remainder?\" \"He was fortunately lying near the river. I cut the remainder of the carcass up into a number of pieces and threw them all into the stream, which is strong and rapid enough to carry them away down the pass before morning. Of course the owners will light upon the blood, but will most likely put it down that the beast has been killed by a bear from the mountains. How have you been getting on?\" \"I made a fire at once and have laid in a good stock of fuel, and have got a batch of chupaties almost ready for eating. They would have been better if I had had a little of that beef fat to mix with them, but I shall be thankful for them as they are, after having eaten nothing but unground corn for the last four days. Now will you please cut off some slices for spitting over the fire? I have never done any work of that sort, and I am afraid that I should make a very poor hand at it.\" In a couple of minutes four good-sized slices of meat were grilling over the fire. \"We have neither salt nor mustard,\" Nita said merrily, as her companion placed two of the savoury[Pg 77] slices on the chupaties. As neither had knives, and the sword-bayonet was a somewhat clumsy instrument for feeding with, they were reduced to making unaided use of their teeth. However, the meal was a merry one, and their spirits rose high at the thought that they were again free, and that with good fortune it might not be long before they rejoined their friends. After the meal was over they had a consultation on the best course to be pursued, and finally agreed to travel west for some time and then to turn south towards the frontier. They would thus at least, they thought, farther throw their pursuers off the track, and would then only have to run the ordinary risk of detection from the tribes through whose territory they passed. They discussed their prospects for the next day\u0027s march, but finally decided to take a day\u0027s rest. Nita had suffered much from the anxiety, and the very long journey had told on her, and as the spot where they then were was well hidden, it was improbable in the extreme that any of the herdsmen or passers through the valley would be at all likely to come upon them. After their meal and talk, Carter made a shelter tent of the large blanket for Nita, and wrapping himself up in another rug, lay down a short distance away. [Pg 78] The next day passed quietly. They had not replenished the fire when they lay down, nor was it necessary to light one in the morning, as they had purposely cooked sufficient to last them for a couple of days. Towards evening they observed three or four herdsmen gathered by the stream at the point where Carter had killed the bullock the night before. They were evidently greatly puzzled at the occurrence, and from their gestures while Carter was watching them, he formed the conclusion that the theory of its being carried away by a bear did not find much acceptance among them. \"However,\" he said, on returning to Nita, who had been having a nap, \"they won\u0027t start off on a search this afternoon, and before morning we shall be well away. We sha\u0027n\u0027t want to repeat the offence for some little time, for the store of meat we now have ought to last us for seven or eight days, that is to say if it does not get bad before that, but I should think that up in these high altitudes it would keep for some time.\" Two hours before daylight they were on the move. The water-skin was refilled at the river, and they put a bundle of firewood on the top of the sack, as they could be by no means certain of finding water and wood on the way. They were so far up the hillside by the time the sun rose that they[Pg 79] had no fear of their appearance being noticed by people in the valley that they had left. They went on merrily, laughing and joking, and were delighted with their progress, though at times the cold was severe in the extreme. They met with no signs of a pass or even the smallest track. Sometimes Carter would ascend to some point which commanded a view of the line that they were following; at others they came to precipices so steep that they had to make a detour of miles before they found a place where a descent could be made into a ravine which, as a rule, was but a water-course covered with boulders of every shape and size. After some days of perpetual toil, they agreed at their camp-fire at night, that they must now have got far enough west and could strike for the south. \"I suppose you have no idea whatever how far the frontier is, Charlie?\" \"Not in the slightest. I don\u0027t even know how far it was from Darlinger to the village, for I was insensible during most of the journey.\" \"It took us six days, Charlie, and I suppose the two villages where we were confined were about the same distance from Darlinger.\" \"What rate did you travel?\" \"I fancy about forty miles the first day, but[Pg 80] considerably less afterwards, making it somewhere between one hundred and fifty and two hundred miles.\" \"Yes, I suppose so, but of course the calculation is mere guesswork, and it may be forty or fifty miles out. Since escaping we have only steered by the sun, and may be a good deal north or south of due west. Besides, we have made such bends and turns as would make it impossible to keep anything like a true reckoning. However, suppose we call it two hundred miles from here to Darlinger, we shall be lucky if, travelling among the hills, we don\u0027t have to go twice that distance. Certainly, unless we get into a very different country from that through which we have been travelling so far, ten miles a day is the extreme that we can calculate upon.\" \"In that case, Charlie, even if all goes well it will be from forty to fifty days before I see my dear father.\" \"But I think we shall travel a good bit faster than that,\" Carter said encouragingly. \"Everywhere through these mountains are valleys, some of them of considerable size, and containing a dozen or more villages. Of course when we come upon these we could travel at night, and ought to be able to do from twenty to thirty miles. We could not have done that at first, but the practice we[Pg 81] have had at this work has put us into first-rate marching condition.\" \"Yes, except my feet, Charlie; think of my poor feet. My shoes are fast disappearing, and I don\u0027t know what I shall do when they come quite to pieces.\" \"I must kill a goat and make a pair of sandals for you of its skin.\" \"Thank you, Charlie, that would be first rate; still, these shoes will do for a bit yet, and I am a little doubtful as to your capabilities as a shoemaker. Well, I think we shall do better to-morrow. From the high ridge we last crossed I could see a large valley in front of us, and I am not sure but I saw villages.\" \"Then your eyes are sharper than mine are; I saw the valley, but I failed to make out anything like habitations. However, in any case, we are not likely to go very fast to-morrow, for I should say that we must be still some fifteen miles from the valley.\" \"Oh well, one day will not make any very great difference. We will go on as long as it is light enough to see, and then camp for the night, go down the next day to a point low in the hills, and can either camp for the night or stop twenty-four hours.\" \"I certainly vote for the halt,\" Carter said, \"I am[Pg 82] sure that we deserve it. How did you think the valley lay?\" \"I should think, from the appearance of the hills behind it, that it must run north and south, which is the right direction for us.\" \"Probably when we get to the other end,\" Carter said, \"we shall find a track of some sort, through which we can pass into the next valley. I don\u0027t know whether there is much traffic between these villages; if so, we shall have to travel at night; if not, we can risk it and go on by day. I hope the latter will be the case. It will be bad enough finding our way along the valleys now that there is no moon, and we should make very slow work of it on the tracks connecting them on a dark night.\" \"We shall have a new moon this afternoon,\" Nita said. \"Yes, it was full the night that I stood at the window, and that is a fortnight ago to-day.\" \"It will be splendid, Charlie, if it gets even half full, then we shall make good travelling, whatever ground we are crossing over. At any rate, when we get into the valley you will let me carry the rifle, won\u0027t you? You insisted on taking it, you know; but if it comes to fighting, I have a right to it, haven\u0027t I?\" \"Certainly you have, and as you are a very[Pg 83] much better shot than I am, it will be more valuable in your hands than in mine.\" The following evening they camped some three miles from the valley. The next day they only moved to a spot where they commanded a full view of it. They thought it was some twenty miles long and contained many villages. \"Thank goodness there is a river running down it,\" Nita said; \"that will be some guide, anyhow. There are only one or two villages on the banks, as far as I can see, the rest are on the hillsides.\" They started as soon as it was dark, made their way down into the valley, and, striking the river, kept along down it; not keeping close, however, for the course meandered so much that it would add very greatly to the distance to be travelled. \"There is the north star,\" Carter said; \"if we keep it on the same hand and steer by it we sha\u0027n\u0027t be very far out.\" They plodded steadily on. More than once they would have walked into a village, but were warned of its exact position by the barking of dogs. However, after what seemed an almost interminable journey they arrived at the end of the valley as morning was breaking. They found that a path ran up the hill in front of them. As soon as they had satisfied themselves about its position they entered a grove close by it and camped there. Eating[Pg 84] a chupatie or two from the store she had cooked the evening before, Nita threw herself down and fell asleep at once. Carter, however, placed himself on watch near the edge of the wood. Four times during the day parties of two or three men went up the path, and this led him to believe that the next valley could not be far away, and that a good deal of communication was kept up with the one they were now in. Late in the afternoon Nita opened her eyes. She looked about for a minute or two before she caught sight of her companion. She at once went up to him. \"You don\u0027t mean to say, Charlie, that you have been watching all this time while I have been asleep?\" \"It was absolutely necessary to keep watch,\" he said, \"and I was very glad to do so. It was nothing to me to miss a night\u0027s sleep.\" \"I am very angry with you,\" she said, \"and insist on taking my turn in future. Now you must lie down at once without a minute\u0027s delay. The sun is already getting low, and we cannot have more than three hours before it is time to start. I suppose it is not very necessary to stand quite still and watch all the time?\" \"By no means. From this point you can see well down the valley, and would be able to make out any one approaching at some distance.\" [Pg 85] \"Very well, then, I will get some meat cooked. I am sorry to say that we have come to our last piece. It has held out a good deal better than we expected.\" \"I have no doubt that we shall be able to replenish it,\" he said; \"there are a considerable number of cattle in these valleys.\" Three hours later they again set out. It was in many places very difficult to keep to the path, and they had to hark back several times, but at length they began to descend so rapidly that they felt that they could be but a small distance from the next valley. They therefore halted and sat down till daylight broke, and then moved away from the path to a mass of great boulders, among which they lay up for the day. Three more valleys were passed in safety. Carter had succeeded in replenishing their supply of meat, and the water-skin was regularly filled whenever they got the chance. \"Things are going on first-rate,\" Nita said, when they halted early one morning. \"Yes, but we must not expect them always to go so well. This valley is getting larger. The houses are more carefully built, and it is, no doubt, inhabited by an increased population. You see, the robes that we are wearing will do well enough to pass at a distance, but they would not bear close inspection.\" [Pg 86] The next evening, emboldened by their good fortune, they started some time before the sun was down, and at a sudden turn in the pass came upon three Afridis. \"Walk straight on,\" Carter said. Nita happened to be carrying the rifle, while Charlie had been obliged to lead the pony. The men paused when within twenty yards of them, and then a sudden exclamation broke from the party, and one raised his rifle and shouted, \"Who are you?\" \"We are travellers on our way to our homes, twenty miles off.\" \"You lie,\" the man said, pointing his gun at them, \"you are not natives of the country.\" Nita had thrown her rifle forward and fired at the same instant as the native. His bullet knocked off her turban, while she shot him through the body. With a shout of rage the other two men raised their rifles, but one fell dead before he could get it to his shoulder. The other fired a shot and then fled with the agility of a deer, getting cover in a moment round a sharp corner of the defile. \"It is unfortunate, but there was nothing else to be done,\" Carter said; \"now what is our best course?\" Nita stood a minute without speaking, and then said: [Pg 87] \"My opinion is that we had better find some spot to hide as close here as possible.\" \"Hide as close to this place as possible?\" Carter said, in surprise. \"I should have thought that we had better turn down the pass at once, or push on.\" \"I do not think so,\" Nita said; \"we must take it as certain that the man who has fled will return as quickly as possible with twenty or thirty others. As they will not see us on our way here they will suppose that we have either returned or have taken to the hills, one side or the other; they would never think of searching close here.\" \"You are right,\" Carter said. \"What do you say to that pile of boulders on the right?\" \"That will do excellently, if we can find a place among them.\" \"We are sure to be able to do that by moving two or three of them. We have probably got a couple of hours to make our preparations.\" Accordingly they set to work at once, and by using their united strength, managed to move enough of them to make a first-rate place of concealment for themselves and the pony. The animal\u0027s legs were fastened, and it was made to lie down, and they took their places beside it. Carter went down the path, and looked at the hiding-place from all sides, in order that he might feel sure that it could not be made out from any point close by.[Pg 88] The heap of boulders lay at the foot of a steep precipice, and it was evident that no one from above could approach near enough to the edge to look down upon them. Having made sure of this he returned to the hiding-place. Three-quarters of an hour passed, and then a score of wild figures armed with rifles, muskets, and other weapons appeared round the corner of the pass. Carter took a glimpse at what was going on. There was an excited conversation; some of the men pointed to the hills on both sides, while some were evidently of opinion that their assailants, whoever they were, had returned to the valley beyond. Finally they broke up into three parties, seven or eight men going on each side, while the remainder pushed on along the path. Half an hour later another sixteen men came up and also divided, half climbing the hills on either side. But night was now falling. For some time the shouts of the searchers could be heard, but these gradually ceased as the men abandoned the hunt as hopeless for the night. They came down in twos and threes, until presently the fugitives were convinced that all had returned. \"It was certainly an admirable plan of yours, Miss Ackworth, and has completely thrown them off the scent. Now we had better be going. The moon gives us enough light to make our way, and [Pg 89]we must be as far as possible from here before morning, when, no doubt, the men of this valley, and perhaps the one that we have just quitted, will turn out in search of us.\" \"I am quite ready,\" Nita said, \"and I have no doubt the pony is too. His sack has been getting lighter and lighter every day, and I think that we haven\u0027t more than thirty or forty pounds left, and as we have always been able to get water, I don\u0027t think that there is more than enough in the water-skin to balance the sack.\" \"I am sorry that the provisions are getting short,\" Carter said, \"but it is an immense advantage, in climbing about among these hills, to have such a light burden. The pony ought to be able to make its way wherever we can, so, as we don\u0027t want to cut ourselves adrift from the valleys, I should say that we had better work round the foot of the hills, in which case we ought to be well to the south of the next valley before day breaks. Fortunately they can have no idea who we are. That we are strangers, and curious ones, they of course know, but we are so far out of the road which they would think the escaped prisoners would take, that it is not at all likely that they will in any way associate us with them, even if they have heard of our escape, which is very improbable. They will therefore have nothing to[Pg 90] indicate the road we are taking. All they really do know of us is that we have a rifle, and can shoot straight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3177/87088.html","bookId":857,"book":{"id":857,"title":"A Soldier\u0027s Daughter","description":"简介： On the North-West frontier of India stood the little fort of Darlinger.
