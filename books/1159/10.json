{"id":28256,"no":10,"title":"VIII. DIFFERENTIAL DUTIES.","content":"A poor vine-dresser of the Gironde had trained with fond enthusiasm a slip of vine, which, after much fatigue and much labour, yielded him, at length, a tun of wine; and his success made him forget that each drop of this precious nectar had cost his brow a drop of sweat. \"I shall sell it,\" said he to his wife, \"and with the price I shall buy stuff sufficient to enable you to furnish a trousseau for our daughter.\" The honest countryman repaired to the nearest town, and met a Belgian and an Englishman. The Belgian said to him: \"Give me your cask of wine, and I will give you in exchange fifteen parcels of stuff.\" The Englishman said: \"Give me your wine, and I will give you twenty parcels of stuff; for we English can manufacture the stuff cheaper than the Belgians.\" But a Customhouse officer, who was present, interposed, and said: \"My good friend, exchange with the Belgian if you think proper, but my orders are to prevent you from making an exchange with the Englishman.\" \"What!\" exclaimed the countryman; \"you wish me to be content with fifteen parcels of stuff which have come from Brussels, when I can get twenty parcels which have come from Manchester?\" \"Certainly; don\u0027t you see that France would be a loser if you received twenty parcels, instead of fifteen?\" \"I am at a loss to understand you,\" said the vine-dresser, \"And I am at a loss to explain it,\" rejoined the Customhouse official; \"but the thing is certain, for all our deputies, ministers, and journalists agree in this, that the more a nation receives in exchange for a given quantity of its products, the more it is impoverished.\" The peasant found it necessary to conclude a bargain with the Belgian. The daughter of the peasant got only three-quarters of her trousseau; and these simple people are still asking themselves how it happens that one is ruined by receiving four instead of three; and why a person is richer with three dozens of towels than with four dozens. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2879/79675.html","bookId":1159,"book":{"id":1159,"title":"Economic Sophisms","description":"简介： My design in this little volume is to refute some of the arguments which are urged against the Freedom of Trade.I do not propose to engage in a contest with the protectionists; but rather to instil a principle into the minds of those who hesitate bec...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2879","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:30 AM"}}
