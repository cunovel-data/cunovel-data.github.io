{"id":108376,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I\u0027d forgotten Martin had decided to drive to the airport directly from work. He\u0027d leave his Mercedes at the plant and pick it up when he came in three days from now. The higher-ups of Pan- Am Agra had scheduled one of those events that made Martin\u0027s blood curdle: a seminar on sexual harassment, recognition and avoidance thereof. All the plant managers were flying in to Chicago to attend, and since Martin had no particular friends among them and hated meetings he wasn\u0027t chairing, his most positive attitude was grim acceptance.\\n\\n When he called me to say he was leaving for the airport, he reminded me over and over about setting the house security system every night. \"How\u0027s Angel?\" he asked, just when he was about to hang up. \"Shelby said she hadn\u0027t been feeling well.\"\\n\\n \"Um. We\u0027ll talk about it when you get back. She\u0027s going to be fine.\"\\n\\n \"Roe, tell me. Is she well enough to help you if you have an emergency?\"\\n\\n I was the only librarian in Lawrenceton, quite possibly in all of Georgia--perhaps even America--to have her own bodyguard. I thought of Angel, stunned and scared, in the doctor\u0027s office that morning, and I thought of calling her for help. \"Sure, she\u0027s okay,\" I said reassuringly. \"Oh, by the way, I saw one of the--well, I don\u0027t know exactly who Dryden and O\u0027Riley work for ... they never said-- well, I ran into him this morning, and he says he has to come out here to talk to me this afternoon.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d almost said I\u0027d met him at the doctor\u0027s, when I\u0027d taken Angel; and then Martin would have asked what the doctor had said, and I didn\u0027t want to lie about it.\\n\\n \"Why does he have to talk to you?\" Martin asked.\\n\\n \"To tell you the truth, I\u0027m not sure.\"\\n\\n \"Roe, have Angel in the house with you when he\u0027s there.\"\\n\\n \"Martin, she\u0027s not well.\"\\n\\n \"Promise.\"\\n\\n Now Martin almost never pulled that string, and it was one we both honored.\\n\\n \"Okay. If she\u0027s not actually throwing up, I\u0027ll have her here.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" he said. \"Now, what can I bring you from Chicago?\" I thought of the big stores, the endless possibilities. I didn\u0027t like that many choices myself.\\n\\n \"Surprise me,\" I said with a smile he could hear in my voice.\\n\\n We said some personal good-byes, and then he went back to his work world, which I could hardly imagine.\\n\\n I piffled around the house for a while, cleaning the downstairs bathroom and sweeping the front porch, the patio, and the steps that led up from the covered walkway running between the garage and the side kitchen door. Finally, I called Angel.\\n\\n She said dutifully that she\u0027d be over before four o\u0027clock, and I apologized for disturbing her on such a day. \"Martin made me promise,\" I explained.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my job,\" Angel said. \"Besides, I don\u0027t want to just sit here and wait for Shelby to come home.\"\\n\\n The doorbell rang.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a florist\u0027s van in the driveway,\" Angel said. She must have been on her portable phone, looking out the front window of the garage apartment. \"I\u0027m coming down.\"\\n\\n She hung up unceremoniously, and I went to the front door and turned off the security system. I heard Angel unlocking the side door leading into the kitchen as the doorbell rang a second time. By the time I shot back the dead bolt, she was standing behind me.\\n\\n \"Delivery to this address,\" said the young black man in blue coveralls. DeLane was stitched on the left chest pocket. He had in his hands a huge arrangement of mixed spring flowers in a tall, clear glass vase. It was lovely: daffodils, baby\u0027s breath, irises, roses.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s it for?\" I asked.\\n\\n DeLane looked very uncomfortable. \"It only says, `To the most beautiful.\u0027 You ladies have to fight over it, I guess,\" he added more cheerfully. He\u0027d had a look at Angel, and I could tell he\u0027d decided who would win.\\n\\n \"Who placed the order?\" Angel asked sharply.\\n\\n \"We got it Call-a-Posy from Atlanta,\" he said with a shrug. \"It seemed pretty strange to us, too, but the shop in Atlanta said it had been paid for. Probably someone\u0027ll call you ladies before long, tell you he sent it.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Angel said abruptly. She took the vase from his hands.\\n\\n I said good-bye and shut the door.\\n\\n Angel was holding the flowers, looking them over carefully. She put them on the low coffee table and peered at the stems through the clear glass; she gently poked the flowers apart with a long finger.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like things coming without a card, coming `to the most beautiful,\u0027\" she said. \"That\u0027s creepy. Presents without names on them make me very suspicious.\"\\n\\n I wondered if Martin could have sent them, perhaps stopped in at a florist\u0027s on his way to the airport. I didn\u0027t think so. He knew there were two women at this address, he would have signed a card, it just didn\u0027t feel right. And the same thing held true for Shelby, who was much more likely to buy Angel a new running outfit or a punching bag than a huge bouquet of flowers. (For Christmas he\u0027d gotten her a new holster for carrying a concealed gun.)\\n\\n \"`Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who\u0027s the fairest one of all?\u0027\" I quoted, trying to make light of the situation. \"You want to take them home, make Shelby jealous? Or maybe he sent them.\"\\n\\n Angel shook her head morosely. \"Having to answer questions about these flowers would just complicate things even more, and I know damn good and well Shelby didn\u0027t send them.\"\\n\\n Our formal dining room lay between the living room and the kitchen, so I went through the large open archway to put a plastic mat in the center of the dining room table. Angel came after me, still frowning, and put the vase on the mat, wiping her hands on her jeans right afterward as if rubbing off the feel of the vase. We both stood and gazed at the flowers some more, but since they didn\u0027t suddenly communicate who had sent them, or blow up, or do anything but sit there looking like flowers, this had limited appeal. I was on the verge of suggesting to Angel we go stare at the inside of the refrigerator when the doorbell rang again.\\n\\n \"Oh, gosh, it\u0027s four o\u0027clock,\" I said, glancing at my wristwatch. \"It must be Dryden and O\u0027Riley.\" I looked up at Angel. \"I should be safe with them.\" I was smiling, but she was not.\\n\\n \"I said I\u0027d stay.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" I went to the door, my heels making a little click on the polished wood floor, a sound which almost always improved my spirits. My house was now about sixty-three years old, and we\u0027d restored it to wonderful condition. It was just an old family home, not even my old family home, but I loved it. I hadn\u0027t reset the alarm system, so Dryden was admitted more rapidly than the florist\u0027s deliveryman.\\n\\n I looked behind him, but O\u0027Riley was nowhere in sight. I was conscious of feeling glad, as I stood aside to let him in, that Angel had decided to stay. At that moment, Dryden\u0027s gaze lighted on her, and his mouth yanked up at one corner, an enigmatic twitch I was unable to interpret. It could have been anything from deep admiration for such a fine specimen of womanhood to irritation that I\u0027d asked someone else to sit in on our conversation.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re by yourself,\" I said, since I\u0027ve never been afraid to state the obvious.\\n\\n \"O\u0027Riley\u0027s on another interview,\" he said, pushing his tortoise-shell-rimmed glasses back on his nose. As if the gesture were contagious, like yawning in a meeting, I pushed mine back, too, and we stared at each other solemnly.\\n\\n \"Please have a seat,\" I told him. \"This is Angel Youngblood. She was in the backyard when Jack Burns fell, too.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for saving us a trip out here,\" Dryden said, and I still couldn\u0027t read his expression. He must have recognized Angel as the woman with me in Dr. Zelman\u0027s office in the morning. He must have read all the police reports, and must have known already about Angel\u0027s presence during the free fall of Jack Burns. Yet he didn\u0027t seem interested.\\n\\n I was getting more and more confused by John Dryden.\\n\\n He finally sat on the couch, and Angel and I picked single chairs opposite him. He turned down my ritual offer of coffee or iced tea, though it was a warm day outside and his suit jacket must be hot.\\n\\n I looked at Dryden closely for the first time. He was big, and square-shouldered, and husky, but not fat, not at all. His eyes were blue behind the glasses, and if he had any gray hair, his light blond hair color concealed it. Of course it was cut very short, as I\u0027d always been led to believe FBI agents wore their hair--if he was an FBI agent--and it lay on his head as smooth as polish. The only other man I knew with hair that blond was Detective Arthur Smith, once my significant other, now married and a father. Lately when I\u0027d run across Arthur his eyes had been hungry. Suddenly I wondered if he\u0027d sent the flowers.\\n\\n I guess I got lost in conjecture, for a loud throat-clearing brought me back to the here and now with a jolt. Angel and Dryden were both waiting for me to say something.\\n\\n I sighed. \"Excuse me, I wasn\u0027t paying attention. Could you repeat that?\"\\n\\n \"Do you know how to fly an airplane?\"\\n\\n I laughed at the idea. \"No,\" I said, since he obviously wanted an answer on the record. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been in the cockpit of a plane.\"\\n\\n \"What about you, Mrs. Youngblood?\"\\n\\n \"I had a few flying lessons in Florida,\" she said calmly. I noticed Angel\u0027s long fingers were resting across her flat stomach. It was incredible to me that a child could be in such a small space, invisible and unknown to anyone around Angel. What an amazing thing to carry inside you; the other choices were so mundane or deathly, like a cold, or cancer, or appendicitis ...\\n\\n I had been drifting again.\\n\\n \"... you remember the name of your instructor?\"\\n\\n \"Bunny Black. She was the owner of this little flying school, Daredevil ... but we had to move and I never had another chance to get my pilot\u0027s license.\"\\n\\n Dryden was jotting all this down, which was plain ridiculous, since Angel had been standing, both feet very much on the ground, while the plane had been absolutely up in the sky.\\n\\n I said as much, politely.\\n\\n He shrugged, and continued to scribble.\\n\\n If he was this exasperating at home, his wife would take a meat cleaver to him one of these days. I leaned over slightly to check his left hand. No ring. Well, I wasn\u0027t surprised.\\n\\n Suddenly he looked up from his notebook, his eyes unexpectedly sharp and blue. We stared at each other for what seemed like a very long moment.\\n\\n I eased back against the chair with an uneasy feeling I\u0027d just contacted Mars.\\n\\n We continued trolling drearily over the horror of yesterday, with Angel and me unable to add a scintilla of information to what we\u0027d already told the county people. I began to be sorry I couldn\u0027t suddenly recall some amazing fact to tell him. \"I just remembered! I had a camera in my hand and I think I clicked the button just as the pilot leaned out of the window of the plane!\" I bet that would change the expression on Dryden\u0027s face ...\\n\\n Shoot, I\u0027d done it again. \"About your relationship with Jack Burns, Ms. Teagarden ...\" Dryden was saying, and I snapped to attention in a very big hurry.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help glancing over at Angel. Her eyes narrowed, she was looking at Dryden carefully, as if deciding where her first blow would fall.\\n\\n \"I never had a relationship with Jack Burns,\" I said flatly.\\n\\n \"So it\u0027s not true that he expressed hostility to you publicly on at least two occasions?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t count,\" I said flippantly, and was instantly sorry. \"Truly, Mr. Dryden,\" and I abruptly remembered police remarking in some article I\u0027d read that suspects invariably were lying when they prefaced a statement with \"To tell the truth,\" or \"Honestly.\" \"To the best of my recollection, Mr. Dryden, I hadn\u0027t spoken to Jack Burns in over two years, so I don\u0027t think you can say that we had a relationship.\" Jack Burns had just seen me in the vicinity of too many corpses to suit his strong police sense. He\u0027d felt I just about had to be guilty of something.\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t want to try to explain this. And I didn\u0027t feel I should have to.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Youngblood, you live in the garage apartment over there?\" Dryden pointed with his pencil to the garage, clearly visible out the south windows of the living room.\\n\\n Angel nodded.\\n\\n \"You rent from Ms. Teagarden here?\"\\n\\n \"We live there rent-free in return for helping Roe and Martin.\" Angel looked completely relaxed, completely blank. She just almost wasn\u0027t there at all.\\n\\n \"Helping?\"\\n\\n Angel raised her eyebrows very slightly. \"We help with the yardwork, I help Roe with her housework, we do all the things you need an extra person to do. Martin travels a lot, and it works out conveniently for Roe.\"\\n\\n I would like to see the day I asked Angel to help me with my housework. But a realistic answer--\"We\u0027re bodyguards\"--would require a lot more explanation than either of us wanted to give.\\n\\n \"And this working relationship has existed for how long?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, come on, what possible bearing can this have on Jack Burns being murdered?\" I asked, suddenly sick and tired of the presence of Dryden in my house, the boredom of these interminable and uncomfortable questions. I could think of lots of things I needed to be doing and would rather be doing than this. And Angel\u0027s husband would be home in about ten minutes, and she should be preparing for a tense and critical evening.\\n\\n I rose to my feet.\\n\\n \"Mr. Dryden, I don\u0027t mean to be rude,\" though I suppose I really did, \"but I assume you have better things to do than this. And I know I do. All we did was be absolutely random witnesses to this terrible thing.\"\\n\\n Dryden, his mouth flattened in anger--at least, I thought it was anger--was putting away his pencil and notebook.\\n\\n \"I hope it won\u0027t be necessary to disturb you again,\" he said, quite calmly. He looked over my shoulder, through the archway to the dining room. \"Pretty flowers,\" he said, still without inflection.\\n\\n \"Thanks for coming,\" I said, with, I hoped, firm civility.\\n\\n Angel looked down at me, shaking her head, when he\u0027d left.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked indignantly.\\n\\n \"When you do that, it\u0027s just like being bitten by a dachshund,\" she said, and drifted to the kitchen door. \"Don\u0027t forget to set the alarm after me,\" she called over her shoulder. I watched her through the kitchen window, loping across the covered sidewalk to the garage, bounding up the wooden steps and unlocking her door. I obediently punched in the right numbers on the panel set in the wall, and I prayed for her and Shelby and the baby.\\n\\n That evening I got another one of those annoying phone calls. I\u0027d been getting quite a few lately, the wrong numbers that don\u0027t say anything when an unfamiliar voice answers the phone. The least the caller could do is say, \"Excuse me, wrong number,\" or \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you.\" Finally I let it ring until the answering machine picked up. So of course, my next caller was Martin. I just let him assume I\u0027d been too far from the phone to pick it up on the first three rings; no point in telling him about the hang-ups. He\u0027d just worry, maybe call the Youngbloods and get them to worry, too.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t tell him about the flowers, either.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t tell him about Angel\u0027s pregnancy.\\n\\n I did tell him about my interview with Dryden. When Martin realized Dryden had come alone, he did one of the things that made me love him; he didn\u0027t say one word about his foresight in insisting Angel be present. But I could hear the difference in his voice as we talked; there was the steel there, the hardness and the edge, that I seldom heard. Maybe that was how he was at work all day, and didn\u0027t bring it home; or maybe only danger brought it out, some perceived threat to him and those people or things he held dear.\\n\\n And you couldn\u0027t accuse him of paranoia, of being too cautious; not with the things I heard on the news every day, not with the horrors he\u0027d seen in Vietnam and Central America. It would be insane egocentrism for me to believe none of these horrors could happen to me.\\n\\n From far away in Chicago, a city I\u0027d never visited, Martin told me to use my common sense, and for God\u0027s sake to remember to set the security system. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5/page-3.html","bookId":2240,"book":{"id":2240,"title":"Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #5) \\n What\u0027s the world coming to - when you can\u0027t relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden?
