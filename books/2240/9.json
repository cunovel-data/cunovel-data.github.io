{"id":108382,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I woke in the morning to a warm bed, Martin still asleep beside me, and rain lashing around the house outside. I peeked at the clock on my bed table; only seven-thirty. Plenty of time to get ready for church at nine-thirty. I squirmed over to press against Martin.\\n\\n He\u0027s a quick waker. As soon as I heard his breathing change he turned over and put an arm around me.\\n\\n \"Martin, about last night,\" I said, my voice still heavy with sleep.\\n\\n \"Not right now,\" he whispered, his hands beginning to travel.\\n\\n \"Ummmm,\" was the next thing I said, and then I didn\u0027t say any more for a good few minutes.\\n\\n In fact, I didn\u0027t say one coherent word until Martin was coming out of the shower I\u0027d previously vacated. As I was tucking my beige-and-black silk blouse into my long beige skirt, I gave him an exaggerated leer. He held up a hand in protest, which caused the bath towel to droop interestingly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even think of it,\" he said. \"Remember my advanced age.\"\\n\\n I laughed, and began brushing my hair. \"I\u0027m pretty sure I could overcome your feebleness,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t want to be late for church. Of course, there\u0027s all afternoon ...\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re not going to the funeral?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shoot.\" I put my brush down and made a face into the mirror. \"I wish you hadn\u0027t reminded me. I guess I could think of an excuse, but I really ought to go. After all, he fell into our yard. I think that obliges me.\"\\n\\n \"You Southerners have the strangest sense of obligation,\" Martin observed.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t often begin a sentence that way, so I forgave him.\\n\\n \"I know you have to go get Shelby, so you won\u0027t be thinking about going to church,\" I said carefully. \"Do you think you\u0027ll be home in time for the funeral? Do you even want to go?\"\\n\\n \"I should go out to the plant for a while,\" he said, pulling on his left sock, \"especially since I was gone for a couple of days this week.\" I tried not to let my face fall. Martin felt he had to go in to work most weekends.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try not to stay long,\" he continued.\\n\\n I made a resigned face at my reflection and rummaged among the lipstick tubes in my dressing table drawer. But I wouldn\u0027t change the sheets; I still had a faint hope that later in the day it would prove to have been wasted effort. Actually, I\u0027d settle for sitting in the same room while we read. Though our sex life was often wonderful, our \"together\" time was minimal. I scanned the closet for my black pumps and slid my bare feet into them.\\n\\n \"No hose?\" Martin said as he zipped up his blue jeans. He reached in a drawer to pull out a T-shirt. He seldom got to dress this casually.\\n\\n \"My knees have scabs from hitting the sidewalk last night, in case you didn\u0027t notice. And they\u0027re pretty sore.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, honey, did I hurt you? Earlier?\"\\n\\n \"If you did I didn\u0027t notice! But now that I\u0027m up and around, I can tell I hit the pavement.\" I flexed my leg and winced.\\n\\n \"Maybe while I\u0027m at the hospital I\u0027ll check to see how Arthur Smith is,\" Martin said, with a marked lack of enthusiasm.\\n\\n \"That would probably be good for appearances, anyway,\" I said. \"Thank God you were holding my hand when he was stabbed ... or whatever happened to him.\"\\n\\n Martin stood behind me and bent to kiss my neck at the spot that always makes me gasp. \"Some people that you dated, being around them doesn\u0027t bother me. But being around Arthur does, not because I think you have feelings for him but because he must still have some for you. He always gives me this look, `I had her first, I know all about the mole on her back,\u0027 crap like that. And once Lynn and he have separated, what does he do? Puts himself right in your line of vision and looks at you as if he was a painter and you were the Mona Lisa.\"\\n\\n \"And gets stabbed,\" I said, to point out that Arthur\u0027s evening hadn\u0027t ended well, however much staring he\u0027d done. I polished my black oblong-framed glasses, the ones I almost always wore to church, since they made me look serious. I peered into the mirror to check my makeup and decided I was entirely too pale. Maybe this year, for the first time since I was a teenager, I\u0027d try to get a tan. If I went about it carefully, perhaps the sun wouldn\u0027t hurt my skin too badly. \"You know, Martin, I\u0027d think I had it worked out if it wasn\u0027t for Arthur,\" I said, pulling a Kleenex out of its box to blot my lipstick.\\n\\n Martin, bent over to tie his Avias, said, \"What? You worked out what?\" \"All this violence.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your theory?\" Martin leaned his elbows on his knees to listen.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s because of Angel.\"\\n\\n Martin was astonished. \"How do you figure that?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said, holding up my fingers. \"Jack Burns\u0027s body was dropped in the yard while she was out mowing.\"\\n\\n Martin nodded cautiously.\\n\\n \"Then Beverly was rude to Angel in the library, and Beverly got attacked.\"\\n\\n I was busy folding fingers down and Martin was nodding.\\n\\n \"Then Beverly\u0027s purse was found on Angel\u0027s car.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"Whoever did it was saying to Angel, `Look what I did for you!\u0027 Like Jack\u0027s body falling in her yard. Just like Madeleine.\"\\n\\n Martin raised his eyebrows, as if to say \"Explicate.\"\\n\\n \"I was watching Madeleine the other day as she was hunting, and I was thinking how yucky it was to have to clean her kills off the doormat. Then I realized that she brought them as an offering to me: like, `I\u0027m a useful cat. See what I did?\u0027 \"\\n\\n Martin was looking a little dazed by my excursion into cat psychology.\\n\\n \"So, Jack was an offering. Like a dead mouse. `See what I did for you? He gave you a parking ticket, so here he is, delivered to your doorstep.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"You think someone is in love with Angel and is showing her that by hurting people who upset her?\" Martin raised his eyebrows, the picture of skepticism.\\n\\n \"It makes a perverted kind of sense,\" I said stoutly. \"And poor Beverly\u0027s purse being put on the hood of Angel\u0027s car. To underline the fact that the attack was--in Angel\u0027s honor.\"\\n\\n \"So, Shelby was hit on the head because he\u0027s her husband?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Why wasn\u0027t he killed?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe because I turned on the downstairs light?\"\\n\\n Martin nodded slowly, not as if he was in love with my theory, but to indicate he was giving it consideration.\\n\\n \"But what about Arthur?\" he asked. \"That won\u0027t wash, with Arthur. I don\u0027t think he and Angel have exchanged two words since she moved here.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong,\" I said smugly, having that instant figured out where Arthur might tie in. \"Remember, Arthur had called her in to the police station before he questioned me.\"\\n\\n \"So this hypothetical admirer just decided he\u0027d given Angel a hard time?\"\\n\\n \"I guess. Actually, Faron Henske interviewed her, not Arthur.\"\\n\\n \"Angel,\" Martin said slowly, doubt in his voice. \"I don\u0027t know, Roe. Angel\u0027s not the stuff dreams are made of.\"\\n\\n \"Not your dreams. But I\u0027ve seen men just about hang their tongues out when she walks down the street,\" I said. \"It\u0027s because she\u0027s so strong and sleek, I expect.\"\\n\\n \"Hmmm. That\u0027s an interesting theory ...\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t believe it for a minute.\\n\\n \"And,\" I added, having had a few more thoughts, \"the police won\u0027t think of it, I bet, because they\u0027re seeing this as attacks on two policemen. Beverly could\u0027ve been mugged and Shelby could\u0027ve heard a prowler.\"\\n\\n \"Roe, the police could be right.\"\\n\\n \"Well... maybe. But I think I am. I just can\u0027t understand,\" I added, as I slid the beige-and-gold- enamel barrette into my hair to hold the waves off my face, \"why the police couldn\u0027t find the knife Arthur was stabbed with.\"\\n\\n \"They certainly searched us all thoroughly,\" Martin said, his voice dry. \"Perry Allison had a pocketknife, but it was perfectly clean. I don\u0027t think the wound could have been deep at all, if they suspected a pocketknife could\u0027ve done it.\"\\n\\n \"No blood on anyone ...\"\\n\\n We shook our heads simultaneously at the opacity of the mystery surrounding the parking-lot stabbing of Arthur Smith, police detective.\\n\\n Martin gave me a kiss and left to go to the hospital, and I finished preparing for church.\\n\\n As I started a load of clothes in the washer on my way out the door, I reflected that this had been the best morning Martin and I had had in a while; longer than I liked to count up. For the past few months, Martin had been traveling more, had stayed in the office longer hours, had never let more than a day pass without going into the plant. Outside of work hours, the Athletic Club took up more time, and the meetings of all the boards and clubs he\u0027d been asked to join--Community Charity Concern, Rotary, and so on and so on--ate into his lunchtimes and his evenings. I\u0027d been increasingly on my own or thrown into the company of Angel and Shelby, with whom I had little in common, fond as I was of both of them.\\n\\n As I retrieved my car keys from the hook by the south kitchen door, I realized Martin and I hadn\u0027t gone out together at night, except for four community functions, in maybe three months.\\n\\n This was not the life the young wife of a handsome, older, wealthy man was supposed to lead, right? He should be hitting all the nightspots flaunting me, right?\\n\\n I\u0027d heard the stupid phrase \"trophy wife\" behind my back on more than one occasion, and I thought it offensive and absurd. Of course I was quite a bit younger than Martin, and I was his second wife; but I was no voluptuous bimbo who\u0027d married Martin for money and security. When Martin wanted to establish himself as the alpha male, he tended to challenge another man to racquetball rather than encourage me to wear low-cut dresses.\\n\\n It might seem--to an outsider--that Martin, to some extent, had lost his taste for me. That our honeymoon was so far over that I was housekeeper and occasional companion to Martin, only. That I\u0027d gone back to work because I was bored and unfulfilled as full-time wife. Or that my married life was sterile because I\u0027d found out I was.\\n\\n Well, I\u0027d certainly succeeded in ruining my morning, all by myself.\\n\\n I yanked open the garage door and backed out my lowly car, blotting my tears and listening to country and western music all the way to St. James\u0027s. I pulled into the parking lot at nine-thirty on the dot. Aubrey, our rector, to whom I\u0027d once been nearly engaged, conducted another service in a nearby town at eleven, so we were his early Eucharist.\\n\\n My eyes were still red, but I powdered over my makeup again to look passable. I could hear the organ playing, so I stuffed my handkerchief and compact back into my purse and slid out of my car. As I slammed the door behind me and began trotting to the church, I heard another car door slam and registered that someone else was even later than I.\\n\\n Standing at the back of the church, I spotted a familiar head of carefully styled Clairol-brown hair. My mother and John Queensland were ensconced in their usual pew in front of the pulpit (John had been having hearing difficulties the past two years). Aubrey, the lay reader, the chalice bearer, and two acolytes were already lined up behind the choir for the procession to the altar. Aubrey and I exchanged fleeting smiles as I scooted past to duck into the next-to-the-back pew, which happened to be empty.\\n\\n I had no sooner pulled down the kneeler and slid to my sore knees, grimacing with the discomfort, than I became aware of a man falling to his knees beside me.\\n\\n I finished my belated prayer, shot to my feet, grabbed the hymnbook, and began trying to find my place in the song all the rest of the congregation was singing as the procession went down the central aisle. Suddenly, a hymnbook was thrust in front of my face, open to the correct page. I took it automatically and glanced up.\\n\\n Dryden was looking down at me, his face unreadable, his eyes expressionless behind his heavy glasses. We exchanged a long look, searching on his part, quite blank on mine, since I hadn\u0027t a thought in my head as to why Dryden would be here in my church juggling a prayer book with a hymnbook in the Episcopalian shuffle. He did not make the mistake of trying to establish a bogus rapport by sharing the hymnbook; but he pulled another one from the rack and joined in the singing with a great deal of enthusiasm.\\n\\n Was this man everywhere? I couldn\u0027t throw a stick without hitting him.\\n\\n As we were preparing to listen to the First Reading, he whispered, \"I put the Andersons on a plane this morning.\"\\n\\n I nodded curtly and kept my eyes straight forward. I couldn\u0027t think of any good reason why I should be the recipient of this information.\\n\\n \"She said to tell you good-bye, that she appreciated you listening.\"\\n\\n I gave him a quelling look, the look I saved for teenage boys cutting up in the library.\\n\\n It seemed to work pretty well on Dryden, because he sat through the rest of the service in silence, affording me some much-needed peace. I wondered if he would follow me up the aisle to take communion, but he stayed in the pew.\\n\\n As we pushed the kneeler up after the final \"Amen,\" Dryden said quietly, \"They\u0027re not coming back. After the incident last night, she\u0027s too afraid.\" I nodded acknowledgment. People were chatting all around us, and so far we weren\u0027t attracting too much attention. I tucked my purse under my arm and opened my mouth to say a firm good-bye.\\n\\n \"I kind of like you,\" he said suddenly.\\n\\n I wondered if the steam coming out of my ears was visible. I took a deep breath to suck my temper back in. \"I don\u0027t care,\" I said in a low, deadly voice, goaded into absolutely sincere rudeness. I was furious, and I was also terrified that any moment a curious churchgoer would wander up to be introduced.\\n\\n Luckily, the rest of the congregation was in line to shake hands with Aubrey, all anxious to get out into the beautiful weather and go home to prepare Sunday dinner. They were also providing a welcome cover of conversational buzz.\\n\\n My mother was talking to Patty Cloud. The detestable Patty was looking absolutely appropriate, as always. By a remarkable coincidence Patty had begun attending St. James\u0027s soon after Mother married John Queensland, who was a lifelong communicant. John was having a back- slapping conversation with one of his golfing cronies.\\n\\n So I was safe for the moment; but any second now, Mother\u0027d look around and then the questions would begin when she called me later, about why I was sharing a pew with one of the objectionable men she\u0027d met at Bess Burns\u0027s house, and what he was saying to me.\\n\\n \"I got the punching bag out of the airplane for you,\" was what he was saying.\\n\\n I gaped at him.\\n\\n I finally managed to say, \"How did you know?\"\\n\\n \"I was watching. With binoculars. From the top of that ridge between the airport and the road. An experiment your reporter friend thought of, huh? Incidentally, we think she\u0027s right; that\u0027s probably how Jack Burns landed in your yard. In that little plane, all the pilot had to do was lean over, open the passenger\u0027s door, bank the plane, and out he went.\"\\n\\n \"You were watching,\" I said, unable to believe my ears. I recalled my long struggle with the bag going down the hill, the grueling process of getting it into the hangar and up into the plane, how I\u0027d sworn and sweated.\\n\\n \"Yep. That was my job, till my bosses decided Jack\u0027s landing in your yard was incidental. After that they withdrew O\u0027Riley and put me watching the Andersons. But I liked watching you better; I never know what you\u0027re going to do. Getting that bag down the hill was pretty hard.\"\\n\\n \"Then why the hell didn\u0027t you come help me?\"\\n\\n It was the only thing I could think of to say, and I spun on my heel and stalked off down the aisle, the last to shake Aubrey\u0027s hand. He looked surprised at my expression, which must have been a picture. I said good-bye hastily and hurried out to my car, praying Mother wasn\u0027t waiting for me in the parking lot. I love my mother, but I just wasn\u0027t up to her today.\\n\\n Somehow Dryden had gotten to his car quicker than I had, and he was pulling out of the parking lot as I unlocked the driver\u0027s door. The car felt oppressively warm and damp inside; I stood by the open door for a minute or two to let the atmosphere clear out.\\n\\n I needed the time myself. I was stunned and shaken by Dryden\u0027s revelation. The thought of being watched when I thought myself unobserved gave me the cold creeps and a hot anger. Dryden must be good; I could believe I\u0027d never spotted I was being followed, but I could scarcely believe Sally hadn\u0027t suspected.\\n\\n But then, why on earth would she?\\n\\n I quickly considered Dryden cast in the role of Angel\u0027s crazy admirer. I had to discard him, though only with great reluctance, after a little reasoning. But Dryden hadn\u0027t met Angel until he\u0027d come out to the house to \"interview\" me.\\n\\n At least as far as I knew.\\n\\n Angel\u0027s past was largely unknown territory to me. Angel was not a great one for talking about herself. I knew she\u0027d grown up in Florida, that she\u0027d met Shelby when he paid a condolence call to her folks. Shelby had been a Vietnam pal not only of Martin, but also of Angel\u0027s much older brother Jimmy Dell. Jimmy Dell had met his Maker after the war and far away from Vietnam, in the mountains of Central America.\\n\\n Shelby had waited a few years for Angel to grow up, then he\u0027d married her. They\u0027d always been happy together, as far as I could see. Even the day or two Shelby had doubted Angel\u0027s pregnancy was his work had not, in the end, disrupted their relationship.\\n\\n Maybe somewhere along the way she\u0027d met Dryden. Maybe they\u0027d both been acting cleverly the day I introduced them. But what would have been the point in that?\\n\\n Oh, this was all so confusing.\\n\\n I looked at my watch. Martin had had plenty of time to pack up the invalid and take both Youngbloods home. The funeral wasn\u0027t until two. I turned the key in the ignition and put the car into drive.\\n\\n Automatically, I turned toward home as I left the parking lot. But after a block, I realized I really didn\u0027t feel like seeing anyone right now. Perhaps I wanted to sulk awhile; maybe roll in a little self-pity. Sometimes I surfaced from my life to look at it in wonderment and irritation and also a certain amount of bafflement. I should have ended up in a house like my mother\u0027s, married to someone like Charlie Gorman, a perfectly nice boy I\u0027d dated in high school. Charlie had always made class vice president; he was the salutatorian; he just missed being handsome. He would have been a good father for, say, two little girls; he\u0027d done well in computers since he\u0027d graduated from college. If I\u0027d married Charlie, I would never have known anyone who died of murder; I would never have seen a dead person. We\u0027d go to Walt Disney World, I dreamed, and we\u0027d camp out...\\n\\n Well, maybe that was going a little far.\\n\\n But I still didn\u0027t feel like seeing anyone I knew, just at the moment.\\n\\n I went where I often go when human companionship seems undesirable; to the Lawrenceton cemetery. I always park by my great-grandmother.\\n\\n A narrow gravel driveway makes a figure eight inside the cemetery fence, to allow for parking at funerals and for easier access to the graves. My great-grandmother is one of the few people buried between the encircling driveway and the fence. She was from a farming family; maybe she wanted to be close to the surrounding fields.\\n\\n Shady Rest is an old cemetery, maintained by a coalition of Lawrenceton\u0027s white churches. The segregation of death is much stricter than segregation is in life, now. The black cemetery, Mount Zion, is on the southern edge of town, while Shady Rest is a little out in the country on the west.\\n\\n Shady Rest is a very ordinary cemetery, traditional, none of this flush-with-the-lawn marker stuff. The earliest tombstones date about twenty years before the Civil War, when Lawrenceton became more than a tiny settlement. There are live oaks and other hardwoods, there is close-clipped grass covering the gently rolling ground. Tiny iron fences interrupted by little gates surround some of the older family plots. There is a high, fancy, ironwork fence enclosing the whole cemetery; but there is no gate to close over the main entrance, though the two other back entrances are gated and usually locked, except during a funeral. There has never been vandalism at Shady Rest, though I\u0027m sure some day there will be. Every now and then, someone donates a cement bench to sit beside one of the two narrow drives that cross through the graves, though I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever seen anyone sit on them but me.\\n\\n After nodding to my great-grandmother, I go sit by Mr. Early Lawrence, most times. Naturally, he was the man Lawrenceton was named after, and he earned it by hustle; an early entrepreneur, was Mr. Early Lawrence. Though his descendants don\u0027t like to talk about it, somehow Early held on to his money and increased it after the War. Even today, none of the Lawrences are poor folks.\\n\\n Early Lawrence had a magnificent tombstone, perhaps ten feet tall because it was topped with a stone angel whose hands were outstretched, palms up, pleading--perhaps urging passersby to feel sorry for Early? To remember to mow the grass? I had never quite understood that beseeching gesture, and I often pondered it when more immediate things gave me pain or anxiety.\\n\\n After the heavy rain of the morning, the ground was soggy. I pulled out the old towel I kept in the trunk of my car, since the bench had a damp look. I picked my way to my chosen spot, spread my flowered towel, and sat down with a sigh.\\n\\n Close to the center of the cemetery, the green tent was set up over the hole dug to receive Jack Burns, I noted approvingly; Jasper Funeral Home was on the ball. The chairs for the family were unfolded and ready with green covers slipped on. Artificial turf discreetly covered the mound of dirt at the back of the tent. The artificial green was gleaming with water droplets.\\n\\n I wandered over to have a closer look, and found that the lowering device was in place over the grave, the green webbing stretched across to receive the casket. I wondered which of the levers on the side released the webbing to let the casket descend, but I was certainly not about to experiment. Sheer interest in the mechanism kept me there for a few moments, until I recollected that into this hole would descend the body of a man I knew, and I beat a shamefaced retreat to Early Lawrence.\\n\\n I looked up at the angel, again studying that calm face for some trace of a clue as to its intent. I wondered who had sculpted it; did he churn them out, or make each one as it was commissioned? He\u0027d enjoyed doing the wings, I could tell ... they were full and beautiful, as feathery as stone could look.\\n\\n I thought the usual thoughts--what would they say, all these dead Lawrencetonians, if they could see the town now, look over the horizon and see Atlanta approaching, encroaching? What if my maternal grandmother, whom I could faintly remember (she was over there close to Great- grandmother, but within the driveway), could give judgment on her daughter\u0027s successes and her grandaughter\u0027s peculiar life?\\n\\n We were not a fertile family; I was the only child of an only child, and according to the specialist, I could not even have that one my mother and grandmother had been granted. I\u0027d known now for two months; but sometimes I still cried when I thought about it. I had to get over that. I began counting my breaths, slow and even; in, out, one, two, three, four... self-pity was a drug. I must not become addicted. Self-pity is like chocolate; as you get older, you can only afford a little bit.\\n\\n I heard a robin, then a mockingbird. Bees did their thing among all the flowering bushes and a few premature Easter lilies, set by gravestones. Here and there was a red foil-covered pot filled with shriveled remains of poinsettias, but on the whole folks took better care of their dead than that.\\n\\n So peaceful. I deliberately took off my watch and dropped it in my purse. After a while, my tears dried and I cut loose from my worries, letting my mind drift. It was as though the countless religious ceremonies held here had drenched the soil not with anguish, but with calm detachment, thoughts of eternity. Every now and then I\u0027d see a car go by; Shady Rest was perilously close to one of the new housing developments.\\n\\n When at last I rose I\u0027d achieved peace, or at least calm.\\n\\n I really wouldn\u0027t have had Charlie Gorman on a platter.\\n\\n I was making my way back to my car, taking my time and reading headstones, when I actually began to think. It seemed to me I hadn\u0027t been asking the right questions. I\u0027d been asking why these bizarre things were happening, who could be doing them, instead of how.\\n\\n I was convinced that all the events of the past couple of weeks were related: the murders of Jack Burns and Beverly Rillington, the murderous attacks on Shelby and Arthur Smith.\\n\\n Jack Burns had been dumped from an airplane, so the killer had to know how to fly. Jack had been killed by a blow to the head (last night\u0027s local paper had said), as had Beverly Rillington, so the killer was strong and not afraid of violence.\\n\\n Since somehow the killer had approached Shelby, who still had no memory of the attack, either (for convenience\u0027s sake I\u0027d term the killer male) he was someone known to Shelby, someone Shelby had no reason to fear; or he was used to stealth.\\n\\n And if the stabbing of Arthur in the middle of a crowd was any indication, this person was getting increasingly reckless. The stabbing had to have been impulsive; the weapon was probably a lowly pocketknife, if the gossip I\u0027d heard had been correct. So someone in the crowd around Arthur had been overwhelmed with fury so sudden and devastating that he\u0027d risked all to injure Arthur.\\n\\n And somehow, somewhere, he\u0027d concealed the weapon so that none of the police on the scene had been able to find a trace of it. Could a pocketknife be swallowed? I wondered wildly. We\u0027d all been searched. Where the hell could it be? This was a crucial how. How had it been concealed?\\n\\n It was the sort of puzzle that I eagerly moved on to find the answer to in every fictional mystery I read. I never tried to figure it out myself when I knew the writer would supply the solution in a page or two. But I couldn\u0027t flip to the end of the book now ...\\n\\n I rolled down the car window, letting the cool breeze toss my hair. I looked at the proper green tent-roof over Jack Burns\u0027s grave. On its surface I replayed the banquet\u0027s ending.\\n\\n Martin and I walked out the door, and he took my hand. Arthur and his date were behind us. I remembered how irritated I\u0027d been with Arthur; how he\u0027d eyed me.\\n\\n And when I remembered that, a little cold trickle started down my spine.\\n\\n But I ignored it with a great effort of will. I was going to track this memory.\\n\\n The cool, sweet evening. The parking lot. The little knot of people on the sidewalk. The quiet voices exchanging pleasantries. Jesse Prentiss introducing Verna, a stout sixty-year-old with a narrow mouth and a tight perm, to the anxious Andersons, who wanted only to be gone. Perry asking Jenny Tankersley if she wanted to go to his place for a drink ... Paul with his hand in his pocket to retrieve his car keys, his date standing with her arms crossed on her chest; probably having circulation problems because her blue jeans were acting as tourniquets. Who else? Marnie Sands, groping in her purse, looking annoyed. I remembered thinking she couldn\u0027t find her keys. We\u0027d moved to the right, facing out into the parking lot, preparing to cross to Martin\u0027s Mercedes. The dog and the cat had provided the diversion necessary for the attacker to make up his mind; he\u0027d try for Arthur ... the idea of what extreme anger must be necessary to prompt such risk- taking made me shiver.\\n\\n Then, of course, my fall to the pavement. I touched my bruised face; I had a blue bump on my right forehead, and a little scrape on my right cheek. I\u0027d been lucky.\\n\\n The confusion, the screaming, the moan and curse from Arthur. Martin helping me up, trying to find out where I\u0027d been hurt. Jesse Prentiss, unexpectedly authoritative, telling Perry to run inside to call the ambulance ... the sound of Perry taking off. There\u0027d been running feet to and from the scene on the sidewalk: Dryden had run up to us, and Perry had run away.\\n\\n Paul Allison had said, too late, that he\u0027d called it in from his car already; Perry had been in the building by the time Paul had told us. Perry had had a perfect opportunity to get rid of the knife.\\n\\n Okay, what about Dryden? His presence at the end of the parking lot was explainable; he was guarding the Andersons. But could he have thrown a knife, somehow? No, I decided reluctantly. Arthur had been facing Dryden\u0027s car, and the wound had been in the back of Arthur\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n Arthur\u0027s date, the little gal with the ponytail? Nope. Not only did it not ring true, but she\u0027d been searched. So had Deena Cotton, who hadn\u0027t been carrying a purse; and if she\u0027d had a gnat in the pocket of those jeans, I would\u0027ve been able to count its legs. Jesse and Verna Prentiss had been standing too far away to reach Arthur, by any stretch of their arms or my imagination. Martin and I had been holding hands and had been in front of Arthur. Marnie Sands had been in the right position and had had her hand in her huge shoulder bag ... but how could she have gotten through the search?\\n\\n Paul had watched us every minute until his fellow officers had arrived, unless ... yes, there\u0027d been the seconds he\u0027d knelt beside Arthur, his hand supporting Arthur\u0027s head; he\u0027d been staring down at his wounded colleague. There\u0027d been seconds, then.\\n\\n But as I\u0027d left the community center, I\u0027d seen the police officers examining the area where Arthur had been stabbed. If the knife had been there--and it could only have been concealed hastily--they would\u0027ve found it.\\n\\n No. Somehow, some way, Perry had concealed the knife on his way into the community center. Had to be Perry.\\n\\n I thought of my friend Sally, about how cheerful she\u0027d been the day we took the punching bag to the airport. She\u0027d already been through so much with Perry, his bouts with depression and his run-in with drugs; the prospect of Jenny Tankersley as a daughter-in-law had to look like Easy Street in comparison. It was inescapable, though, that Perry looked like the best bet for this series of horrible events. He\u0027d looked at Angel with wanting eyes; he\u0027d had a chance to hide the knife.\\n\\n But that wasn\u0027t enough, even close to enough, evidence for an arrest.\\n\\n I started the car and drove out of the cemetery slowly, not having the slightest idea of where I was going. It was noon, lunchtime. I bought a sandwich from our local barbecue place and ate it sitting in the car, a practice I normally detest. Maybe I should have called Martin. I thought of doing it, then I remembered the day before when I\u0027d had to track him down, and I childishly thought it might do him good to wonder where I was for a while. But those were surface thoughts, ideas that just skated through the front of my brain.\\n\\n I had the feeling you get when everyone begins roaring with laughter at a joke, and you sit anxiously waiting for the punch line to make sense. There was something big and obvious right in front of me, and I couldn\u0027t see it. It was like there was a hole in my glasses. In that spot, I was blind, though I could see clearly all around it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5/page-9.html","bookId":2240,"book":{"id":2240,"title":"Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #5) \\n What\u0027s the world coming to - when you can\u0027t relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden? Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department\u0027s finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe\u0027s friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe\u0027s feet. Roe\u0027s husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It\u0027s only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe\u0027s yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:29 PM"}}
