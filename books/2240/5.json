{"id":108378,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"When I came in to work the next morning, I was not feeling exactly cheerful. The discussion with Sam the day before had gone about as I\u0027d expected it to go, Beverly stoutly denying she was difficult to work with, accusing me of many things, all but saying that had she had my education she would now have my job. That may have been true, but it was not the issue we were there to discuss. Even if I\u0027d agreed with that assumption, it wouldn\u0027t have changed a thing. After an upsetting forty-five minutes, during which nothing had been settled and Sam\u0027s hair had turned a little grayer right before my eyes, I\u0027d gone to pick up Madeleine at the vet. They\u0027d gotten the blood sample and sent it to a lab, Dr. Jamerson had told me with determined cheerfulness, and he expected to get a reply from the lab in a few days, maybe a week. I\u0027d loaded Madeleine in my car with the strong feeling that the vet and his staff wouldn\u0027t have minded a bit if the hypothetical drugger had used something stronger and more lethal, or perhaps tied that bow a little tighter. Somehow I\u0027d expected Dr. Jamerson to have the answer ready right then--had Madeleine been drugged or had she not?--and not knowing had thrown me even further off course. As Madeleine yowled on the way home, I had found myself thinking of getting a dog, a medium-sized stupid one who was everyone\u0027s friend. A mutt with brown rough hair and a black muzzle ... but Jane Engle, who\u0027d left me Madeleine and a heck of a lot of money, had somehow astral-projected her strongly disapproving face right into my consciousness. So I trudged into the library\u0027s back door feeling dispirited. At least Angel had been out running this morning as I was driving in to town. She\u0027d grinned and waved at me. A smiling Angel-- and one with a bulging abdomen--was something I would have to get used to. I smoothed my own oversized orange T-shirt over my stomach; I was wearing orange leggings, too, and there was a big gold sun on the front of my tee. I was hoping the children would think it a cheerful outfit. I\u0027d pulled my hair back with an orange-and-gold barrette, and I was wearing my gold-framed glasses. Just a blaze of color, that was me. \"Who was that woman who came in to see you yesterday?\" Perry asked, as I stowed my purse in my locker. He was using the microwave to make hot chocolate, which he drank regardless of the outside temperature; he had quite a sweet tooth, though by his leanness you wouldn\u0027t have guessed it. Here I was, I thought wryly, glowing all over the place, and as usual, I was being asked about ... my bodyguard. \"Angel Youngblood.\" \"She\u0027s not local.\" \"No. She\u0027s from Florida.\" \"Married?\" Well, well, well. \"Very,\" I said firmly. \"And a black belt in karate, as is her husband.\" Perry didn\u0027t seem dismayed by this news. \"She\u0027s just stunning,\" he said. \"I could tell by the way she walks that she\u0027s an athlete. And her coloring is so unusual.\" \"Yep, she\u0027s gold,\" I answered, burrowing in my locker for a tube of breath mints. I\u0027d had this conversation with many men (and some women) about Angel. \"I thought you were pretty tight with Jenny Tankersley?\" \"Oh, we\u0027re dating,\" Perry said casually, though his mother Sally had told me they were all but engaged. Jenny wouldn\u0027t have been pleased to hear Perry dismiss her so cavalierly, from what I\u0027d heard of her. She\u0027d been married for a few years to a man who ran his own crop-dusting service, and when Jack Tankersley had made a fatal mistake regarding plane altitude one summer, Jenny had ended up selling the business and doing very well for herself. She\u0027d stayed on as general dogsbody for the three pilots who\u0027d bought it, doing every task from answering the phone to ordering supplies to making out the checks, and occasionally she flew herself, as she had with her husband. Perry seemed drawn to strong women. \"Your friend Angel must be the woman Paul was talking about last night,\" Perry said, stirring his Swiss Miss with a plastic spoon. I was standing awkwardly, my weight on the foot closest to the door, waiting to terminate this conversation so I could get to my area, though I was dreading seeing Beverly. I had a kindergarten class coming in fifteen minutes, and I\u0027d left a note requesting yesterday\u0027s volunteer to cut out twentytwo spring flowers, one for each child to write his or her name on, to stick to the ends of the bookshelves. Hopefully, each child would bring a parent into the library to see the flower, and the child and the parent would both check out books. I had to get out the yellow stickum, and I had to count the flowers ... \"You had supper with your mom\u0027s ex?\" I said with some surprise. \"Paul and I have always gotten along. He\u0027s been more like a father than an uncle to me. Especially since I\u0027ve only seen Dad a few times in my whole life,\" Perry added with understandable bitterness. The fact that Sally\u0027s latest ex, Paul Allison, was the brother of Sally\u0027s first ex, Perry\u0027s father Steve, made the situation a little complicated emotionally. I was glad there wasn\u0027t a third Allison brother, and I was willing to bet Sally was too. \"Jenny\u0027s giving flying lessons now,\" Perry said, determined to chat. \"I\u0027m taking, and so is Paul, and your friend Arthur Smith ...\" \"That\u0027s great, Perry, and I want to hear more about it later,\" I said insincerely. \"I\u0027ve got to get to work now, I\u0027ve got a group coming in.\" But even as I banished visions of the Lawrenceton police force on air patrol, focusing instead on visions of little kids who were going to want some individual recognition in about ten minutes, Sam came out of his office and strode over to us looking very worried. Sam is not very good with people; he is a great manager of things, but not a great personnel guy. He\u0027s become aware of that in the past few years, and whenever he has to say anything that is going to upset someone, he stews over it. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t expect anything awful; he was probably going to tell me the board had decided to hire a full-time children\u0027s librarian and my job was terminated. I had a moment to think of this before he put his hand on my arm and said, \"In view of our conference yesterday, I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re going to take this, but Beverly Rillington was so badly beaten last night they don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll live.\" \"What? Why?\" I asked. \"Sit down, Roe, you\u0027re white as a sheet,\" Sam advised. He pulled out one of the chairs that had been tucked under the round table. Perry sat down right by me, and I noticed he was on the pale side, too. \"Beverly\u0027s mother Selena was hit by a drunk driver a month ago,\" Sam said. \"She\u0027s still in a coma at the hospital. Beverly goes to see her every night. When Beverly got out of her car at her house after visiting her mother, someone jumped on her from behind and hit her with a piece of pipe. More than once.\" \"Oh my God,\" I said. I shook my head. What a dreadful thing. \"Sam, did you know about her mother?\" Beverly hadn\u0027t breathed a word to me, and I suddenly realized the pressure Beverly had been under. Had pride kept her silent? \"She didn\u0027t tell anyone here,\" Sam said, shaking his head. \"It was in the paper,\" Perry volunteered. \"The wreck, that is. But I didn\u0027t realize the injured woman was Beverly\u0027s mom.\" \"So ... is Beverly ... how bad is it?\" I asked. \"Severe head wounds,\" Sam answered succinctly. \"Listen, I\u0027ve got to tell the others, and send a flower arrangement to the hospital; don\u0027t you have a group coming in this morning, Roe?\" I glanced at my watch and shot out of the chair. Five minutes later, I met the kindergarten class at the door with a shaky smile, and hoped they wouldn\u0027t notice my hands were trembling as I passed each of them a bright construction paper flower. After they\u0027d left, I had a little time to think between helping patrons. I wondered if someone had it in for Beverly\u0027s family. Had her mother\u0027s accident really been an accident? Or was the attack on Beverly totally unrelated, a kid on some kind of high taking the easiest money available? A person would definitely have to be chemically altered to have the nerve to tackle Beverly, who was physically as well as mentally formidable. As I sat with my hands folded in my lap at my little desk, staring blankly at the shelves of books that walled me in, I wished Beverly and I hadn\u0027t had our fracas the day before--and when I thought twice about it, I wished even more it hadn\u0027t been witnessed by so many people. Sure enough, when I was called to the phone, Arthur Smith was on the other end, at the police station. The Rillingtons\u0027 house was in the city limits, so the city police were handling the investigation into the attack on Beverly. \"Roe, I wonder if I could talk to you after you get off work, about that incident in the library yesterday,\" Arthur said. He had always been blunt. Once upon a time, I\u0027d found that directness very exciting. \"Okay,\" I said with a detectable lack of enthusiasm. \"Could you come by the station this afternoon, say around two o\u0027clock?\" \"I guess so. Why the station?\" \"It\u0027ll just be more convenient,\" he said. I liked this less and less. But it seemed paranoid to wonder if I needed a lawyer. Why was Arthur calling me, anyway? He was a robbery detective. Lynn Liggett Smith, his wife, was the only homicide detective on the Lawrenceton force, so other detectives were detailed to her sometimes, but why Arthur? I began to wonder if I shouldn\u0027t call Martin out of his seminar in Chicago and ask his advice. Nah. I\u0027d talk to him tonight. Then I wondered if I should call my mother, and it didn\u0027t seem like such a bad idea to tell her where I was going. Naturally, since Mother owns a prosperous realty business, the line was busy. So I figured I\u0027d just stop by on my way to the police station. Mother\u0027s office, established in an old house and redecorated in calm, elegant colors, always made me feel inadequate. I\u0027d hoped once to get interested in real estate, had even started studying for my license, but at last I\u0027d had to admit that my only interest in real estate was in buying my own. When terms like \"equity\" and \"Fannie Mae\" and \"assumable mortgage\" began to be bandied about, my brain glazed over. But when I watched the controlled and purposeful bustle on good days at Select Realty, I felt a pang of regret. Mother\u0027s terrifyingly perfect receptionist, Patty Cloud, had graduated to office manager and then to realtor. Her understudy, Debbie Lincoln, now controlled the desk in the reception area. Debbie had done some evolving of her own, from a rather slow, silent girl with cornrowed hair and baby fat to a slim, streamlined, fashionable babe who\u0027d become the office computer expert. In the process, Debbie had gained a lot of artifice, and shed some of her natural charm. She\u0027d also acquired confidence and lost her diffidence around older people. As I entered, she gave me an \"I see you but I\u0027m in the middle of this\" smile and waggle of magenta fingernails, the phone clamped between ear and shoulder, her fingers busy separating computer sheets, collating and stapling them. \"Uh-huh. Yes, Mrs. Kaplan, she\u0027ll be there at three. No, ma\u0027am, you don\u0027t need to do anything special. She\u0027ll just look over the house and tell you what she\u0027d recommend you ask for it ... no, ma\u0027am, that doesn\u0027t obligate ... no, ma\u0027am, you can call in as many as you like, but we hope you\u0027ll list your house with us ... right, three o\u0027clock.\" Debbie blew a breath out after she\u0027d hung up. \"Difficult?\" I asked. \"Girl, you know it,\" Debbie said, shaking her head. \"I half hope that woman doesn\u0027t decide to list with us. Dealing with her is almost more trouble than it\u0027s worth. Your mom is showing a house now, so if you wanted to see her, you may have quite a wait.\" \"Heck,\" I said. I wondered whether I should leave a note. \"Debbie, do you know Beverly Rillington?\" I asked out of the blue. \"Oh, isn\u0027t that terrible, what happened to her?\" Debbie stapled the last batch of papers together and tossed the result into Eileen Norris\u0027s basket, which was half full of phone message slips already. Debbie followed my glance. \"Eileen can\u0027t get used to coming out here every time she comes back in the building,\" Debbie said. \"So her stuff kind of piles up. I don\u0027t really know Beverly that well, she goes to a different church,\" she added. \"But Beverly has always been a real tough individual, a real loner. She had a baby, you know, when she was just fourteen ... and then, when that baby was about a year old, it choked on a marble or something and died. Beverly hasn\u0027t had it easy.\" I tried to imagine being pregnant at fourteen. I tried to imagine my baby dying. I found I didn\u0027t want to imagine that. \"I guess I\u0027ll just leave Mother a note,\" I told her, and started down the hall to Mother\u0027s office. It was the biggest one, of course, and Mother had decorated it in cool, elegant gray, with a slash of deep red here and there for eye relief. Her desk was absolutely orderly, though covered with the paperwork on various projects, and I knew the notepads would be in the top right drawer--and they were--and that all Mother\u0027s pencils would be sharp ... and that I would snap off the point of the first one since it was so sharp and I pressed so hard. Having gone through that little ritual, all I had to do was compose a message to let her know I was going to be at the police station at a detective\u0027s request, without propelling her out the office door with her flags flying. Maybe such a composition wasn\u0027t possible, I decided after sitting for several blank seconds with the (now blunt) pencil actually resting on the paper. After a false start or two, I settled on: \"Mom, I\u0027m going to the police station to tell them about working with Beverly Rillington at the library. She got hurt last night. Call me at home at four o\u0027clock. Love, Roe.\" That should do it. I knew if I wasn\u0027t at home at four she\u0027d storm the bastions and get me released. The car by which I parked at the police station/small claims court/county sheriff\u0027s office/jail (known locally as \"Spacolec\" for Sperling County Law Enforcement Complex) seemed very familiar, and after a second I recognized Angel\u0027s car, the one Jack Burns had ticketed. Then I recalled Angel telling me she was going to the funeral because they\u0027d worked out together; the two stories seemed mutually exclusive. I mulled it over for a minute as I trudged through the hot parking lot to the glass double doors leading into Spacolec. It was still making no sense when I saw Arthur Smith waiting for me right in front of the wall-to- wall admissions desk. Arthur had changed little in the three years he\u0027d been married to Lynn. Marriage had not put a gut on him or lined his face; fatherhood hadn\u0027t grayed his tightly curled hair, though it was such a pale blond that the gray, when it did appear, would be enviably hard to detect. Perhaps he\u0027d changed in the way he held himself, his basic attitude; he seemed tougher, angrier, more impatient, and that was so apparent that I wondered I hadn\u0027t noticed it before. Arthur, who\u0027d been chatting with the duty officer, turned at the hissing sound of the pneumatic doors. He looked at me, and his face changed. I felt acutely uncomfortable. I was unused to being the object of unrequited desire. Now, Angel (whom I now saw coming toward me out of the set of swinging wooden doors to the left of the reception desk) must have encountered panting men from adolescence onward. I would have to ask her how it made her feel. Right now she looked washed out, and her stride did not have its usual assurance. \"Are you okay?\" I asked anxiously. She nodded, but not as if she meant it. \"I\u0027m just going to go home and lie down,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been this tired in my life. And I\u0027m hungry. Really, really hungry.\" \"Need help?\" \"Nah. Shelby\u0027ll be home in an hour.\" She hadn\u0027t spoken to Arthur directly, but her next words were aimed at him. \"If you\u0027re not home by then, I\u0027ll call Bubba.\" Bubba Sewell was my lawyer. \"See you later,\" I said, and she was out the glass doors and into the parking lot. I watched her reach her car, unlock it, stretch her arms up and rotate her shoulders to relax, each movement economical and controlled despite her weariness. \"Come this way, Roe,\" Arthur said, snapping me back to the unwelcome present. He was holding open the wooden doors, nodding at the woman in uniform on duty at the desk behind bullet-proof glass, gesturing me forward. As I went through the doors, he put his hand on my back to steer me, a controlling gesture I particularly dislike. I don\u0027t much care for being touched casually. I stiffened a little, but put up with it. When I realized I was only tolerating his touching me because he had once been my lover, I stepped away a little quicker, leaving his hand behind, and his arm dropped to his side. Arthur waved a hand at his own little cubicle to usher me in. He indicated the only other chair besides the one behind the desk, and murmured something about being back in a minute. Then he vanished, leaving me nothing to do but examine his \"office.\" It was a bit like being at a car dealership where each salesman has to usher you into a little area partitioned off at neck level, and there present you with pages of scrawled figures. I could tell Arthur worked there; there was a picture of little Lorna, though none of Lynn. But there wasn\u0027t clutter, there wasn\u0027t even much office material on the desk: no Rolodex, no blotter, no stapler. There were stacked in and out trays, and a chipped Christmas coffee mug holding some pens and pencils. That was it. I\u0027d exhausted the possibilities of Arthur\u0027s office. Then I observed that though the partition walls were made of beige metal and padded with what looked like carpet, each panel contained a Plexiglas window. I could see down the row of similar cubicles. Lynn was two squares away, bent over some paperwork on her desk. She looked up as I was still gazing curiously in her direction. She gave me an unreadable stare and then looked down at her desk pointedly. From being mildly uneasy at being here, I escalated instantly into very uncomfortable. Had I been brought here as some ploy in Lynn and Arthur\u0027s marital wars? Arthur reappeared just as I was thinking of leaving. He was holding two unmatched mugs of coffee, one with cream and sugar and one black. He put the black in front of me. \"I remembered that was the way you like it,\" he said. I could read nothing in his tone. I thanked him and tried a sip. It was awful. I put it down carefully. \"Why am I here, Arthur?\" \"Because you had a very public quarrel with Beverly Rillington yesterday. Because she was attacked and her purse stolen last night. When I heard Mrs. Youngblood had been present during the quarrel, I called her in too. Faron Henske just finished questioning her.\" So that\u0027s why a robbery detective was handling the case. They were treating the attack on Beverly as a robbery gone berserk. \"Why couldn\u0027t you just ask me about it at my house, or over the phone, or at the library?\" \"Because this was the best place,\" he said, very male tough policeman. I raised my eyebrows slightly. I pushed my gold glasses back up on my nose. \"Then ask your questions.\" So we went through the miserable scene at the library again; the rising rage of Beverly, the arrival of Angel, Angel\u0027s exchange with Beverly, the gradual defusing of the crisis. \"Did you think Beverly was physically threatening you?\" Arthur asked quietly. He was sitting back in his chair, his gaze locked on me in a way I\u0027d once considered flattering and exciting. \"I had a second of worry.\" \"Weren\u0027t you glad your bodyguard was there to handle it for you?\" I could feel my eyes fly open even wider, my shoulders stiffen. Arthur looked pleased to get such a response. \"Did you think we wouldn\u0027t figure it out, Roe? Back when the Julius family turned up, we checked out your friends the Youngbloods. Shelby Youngblood and your husband have quite a history together, don\u0027t they?\" \"Martin and Shelby have been friends since Vietnam.\" \"Involved in some murky doings after that, weren\u0027t they?\" \"What are you getting at, Arthur? You know Martin was out of town last night. Are you implying that one of the Youngbloods attacked Beverly Rillington because she gave me a few bad moments in the library?\" \"There are telephones in Chicago.\" Arthur had been leaning negligently back in his chair. Now he abandoned the relaxed pose and leaned forward, his hard eyes still fixed on me. \"So you\u0027re saying that my husband was so upset that I had a few words with Beverly--in front of many witnesses--that he told the Youngbloods to beat her up.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that. But it seems pretty coincidental that after a decade of giving people grief, Beverly Rillington gets beaten within an inch of her life just after a quarrel with you and your bodyguard.\" He gave the last two words a twist that was distinctly unpleasant. I began to think that Arthur had gone off the deep end of the pool without checking to see if there was any water. \"You\u0027re certainly not suggesting that I did it,\" I said reasonably, though I felt anything but reasonable. \"I think Beverly has a few inches and pounds on me.\" \"No,\" Arthur said, never letting up on the stare. \"No, not you. But someone who cares for you.\" I started to say, \"What about someone who cares for Angel?\" Because it seemed to me that Angel had been insulted publicly too, and if the theory that the incident in the library had sparked this attack held any water, Angel could be the inspiration for the beating far more feasibly than I. No one ever forgot Angel. But expressing this would be tantamount to pointing the finger at Shelby, at least in Arthur\u0027s present state of mind. \"So. You\u0027re sure I didn\u0027t hurt Beverly. So--why am I sitting here being questioned if you are telling me you\u0027re sure I didn\u0027t do it?\" And without pausing to give him a chance to respond, I gathered up my purse and stalked out of Spacolec. My back was tense with expecting him to call me at any moment, but he didn\u0027t. Like most of my grand gestures, this one was ruined by the situation I came upon out in the parking lot. Instead of sliding into my car and speeding away with a spray of gravel, I had to deal with two more angry people. Angel was standing in front of her car, her face expressionless but her attitude tense. Beside her, talking into a radio, was Detective Paul Allison, who for once looked agitated. On the hood of Angel\u0027s car, giving the impression of a spilled bag of garbage, was a battered black imitation-leather purse, gap-mouthed and leaking the miscellany of a woman\u0027s life: comb, wallet, Kleenex, crumpled shopping lists, a tube of mints. I recognized it. It was Beverly\u0027s purse, surely the purse that had been stolen from her during the attack the night before.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5/page-5.html","bookId":2240,"book":{"id":2240,"title":"Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #5) What\u0027s the world coming to - when you can\u0027t relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden?
