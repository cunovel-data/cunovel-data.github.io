{"id":108374,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"My bodyguard was mowing the yard wearing her pink bikini when the man fell from the sky.\\n\\n I was occupied with adjusting the angle of the back of my folding \"lounger,\" which I\u0027d erected with some difficulty on the patio.\\n\\n I had some warning, since I\u0027d been aware of the buzzing of the plane for several seconds while I struggled to get the back of the lounger to settle somewhere between totally prone and rigidly upright. But Angel had one of those little tape players strapped to her waist (the plastic belt looked strange with the bikini) and the headphones and the drone of the lawn mower made her oblivious to the unusual persistence of the noise.\\n\\n Circling low, I thought with some annoyance. I figured an aviator had spotted Angel and was making the most of his lucky day. Meantime, the ice in my coffee was melting and my book was lying on the little lawn table unread, while I wrestled with the stupid chair. Finally succeeding in locking the back of the lounger into a position approximating comfort, I looked up just in time to see something large falling from the little plane, something that rotated horribly, head over heels.\\n\\n My gut recognized disaster seconds before my civilized self (which was pretty much just saying \"Huh?\") and propelled me off the patio and across the yard to knock Angel, all five feet eleven of her, away from the handle of the mower and under shelter of an oak tree.\\n\\n A sickening thud followed immediately.\\n\\n In the ensuing silence, I could hear the plane buzzing away.\\n\\n \"What the hell was that?\" Angel gasped. Her headphones had been knocked off, so she\u0027d heard the impact. I was half on top of her; it must have looked as if a Chihuahua was frolicking with a Great Dane. I turned my head to look, dreading what I would see.\\n\\n Luckily, he\u0027d landed face down.\\n\\n Even so, I was nearly sick on our newly mown grass, and Angel quite definitely was.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why you had to knock me down,\" Angel said in a voice distinctly different from her flat south Florida drawl. \"He probably missed me by, oh, thirteen inches.\"\\n\\n We were pushing ourselves to our feet, moving carefully.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to have to buy a new lawn mower,\" I said through clenched teeth. A side chamber in my mind was feeling grateful that our lawn mower was one of those that stop moving when the handle is released.\\n\\n Angel was right about it being a man, judging from the clothes and the haircut. He was wearing a purple-and-white check shirt and brown pants, but the fashion police were not going to be bothering him anymore. A very little blood stained the shirt as I looked. He\u0027d landed spread- eagled; one leg stuck out at a very un-alive angle. And then there was the way his neck was turned ... I looked away hastily and took some long, deep breaths.\\n\\n \"He must be three inches into the ground,\" Angel observed, still in that shaky voice.\\n\\n She seemed preoccupied with measurements today.\\n\\n Paralyzed by the suddenness and totality of the disaster, we stood together in the shade of the oak, looking at the body lying in the sun. Neither of us approached it. There was a stain spreading through the grass and dirt in the head area.\\n\\n \"And of course, the guys aren\u0027t here today,\" I said bitterly, apropos of nothing. \"They\u0027re never home when you need them.\" Angel looked at me, her jaw dropping. Then she began hooting with laughter.\\n\\n I was unaware I\u0027d said anything amusing, and I was at my most librarian-ish when I added, \"Really, Angel, we\u0027ve got to stop standing around talking, and do something about this.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re absolutely right,\" Angel said. \"Let\u0027s put some tulip bulbs in potting soil on top of him. They\u0027ll come up great next year.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s way too late to put in tulips,\" I told her. Then, catching myself, feeling the day had already spun out of hand, I said, \"We\u0027ve got to call the sheriff.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, all right.\" Angel stuck out her lip at me like a six-year-old whose fun had been spoiled, and laughed all the way into the house. I hadn\u0027t seen Angel Youngblood laugh that much in the two years she\u0027d been my bodyguard.\\n\\n She was serious enough an hour later, when Padgett Lanier was sitting on my patio with a glass of iced coffee. Lanier was perhaps the most powerful man in our county. He\u0027d been in office in one capacity or another for twenty years. If anyone knew where all the bodies were buried in Lawrenceton, Georgia, it was this man. With a heavy body, scanty blond hair, and invisible eyelashes, Lanier wasn\u0027t the most attractive man in my backyard, but he had a strong presence.\\n\\n The \"most attractive man\" prize had to go to my husband of two years, Martin Bartell, vice president of manufacturing at Pan-Am Agra, Lawrenceton\u0027s largest employer. Martin is a Vietnam vet, and at forty-seven he\u0027s fifteen years older than I. He pumps iron and plays various one-on-one competitive sports regularly, so his physique is impressive, and Martin has that devastating combination of white hair and black eyebrows. His eyes are light, light brown.\\n\\n Angel\u0027s husband Shelby, who was lounging against the kitchen door, is swarthy and graying, with a Fu Manchu mustache and pockmarked cheeks. He is soft-spoken, polite, and an expert in the martial arts, as is Angel. Shelby and Martin are longtime friends.\\n\\n Right now, Angel and I were the only women in sight. There were three deputies, the coroner, a local doctor, the sheriff, and our husbands. There were two men in the ambulance crew waiting to take \"the deceased\" to--wherever they took things like that.\\n\\n Lanier gave me a thorough head-to-toes evaluation, and I realized I was wearing shorts, a halter top, and dried sweat, and that my long and wayward hair was sloppily gathered into a band on top of my head. \"You musta been enjoying the sun, Miss Roe,\" he said genially. \"A little early in the spring for it, ain\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Now my friends call me Roe, but I\u0027d never counted Lanier among them. I realized it was Lanier\u0027s way of handling a problem. I\u0027d kept my own name when I\u0027d married Martin, a decision on my part that I don\u0027t yet understand, since my laughable name had been the bane of my life. When you introduce yourself as \"Aurora Teagarden\" you\u0027re going to get a snigger, if not a guffaw.\\n\\n Padgett didn\u0027t know whether to call me Miss Teagarden, Mrs. Teagarden, or Mrs. Bartell, or Ms. Teagarden-Bartell, and \"Miss Roe\" was his compromise gesture.\\n\\n My husband was watching the activity by the mower, standing with the relaxed attitude of a guy who comes home every day to find a man embedded in his lawn. That is to say, Martin was trying to look relaxed, but his gaze was following every move the lawmen made, and he was very busy thinking. I could tell because his mouth was an absolutely straight line, and his arms were crossed across his chest, the fingers twiddling: his Thinking Stance. The slightly taller Shelby lounged over to stand beside Martin, his hands stuck in his jeans pockets to show how relaxed he was. With the synchronicity born of long association, the two men turned and looked at each other, some silent comment about the fallen dead man passing between them.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t responded to Lanier, and he was waiting for me to say something.\\n\\n \"Well, we were taking turns mowing the lawn,\" I answered. \"And that\u0027s always hot work. I did the front, so Angel took the back.\" If I mow the front, I count it as my exercise for the day, and I don\u0027t have to pop in that stupid videotape and dance in front of the TV. We live a mile out of town, in the middle of fields, and we have a very large front yard, and a big back one.\\n\\n Martin, listening, shook his head absently, as he always did when my distaste for (most) strenuous physical activity crossed his mind. But he was still looking at the man embedded in our backyard.\\n\\n \"Do you think he\u0027ll be recognizable when he\u0027s turned over?\" he asked the sheriff suddenly.\\n\\n \"No telling,\" Lanier said. \"We\u0027ve never had one dropped from a plane before. Now I wonder, do you suppose that body landed here on purpose?\"\\n\\n He had our full attention now, and he knew it. I felt a jolt of dismay.\\n\\n \"Would you like some more ice coffee?\" I asked. (I know it\u0027s \"iced,\" but that\u0027s not what we say.)\\n\\n He glanced at his glass. \"No, ma\u0027am, I reckon I\u0027m fine right now. Did that plane circle around before the man fell?\"\\n\\n I nodded. Lanier\u0027s gaze moved to Angel, where it dwelled wonderingly. She was something to see.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Youngblood, you said you didn\u0027t see it?\"\\n\\n \"No, Sheriff. I had the lawn mower running and I was listening to a tape.\" Angel, who\u0027d pulled a white T-shirt on over her bikini, was getting plenty of surreptitious attention from the deputies and the ambulance men. It ran off her like water off a duck\u0027s back. Angel is not pretty, but she is tall, very muscular and lean, and golden as a cheetah. Her legs are maybe a mile long.\\n\\n \"Miss Roe, you actually saw him fall?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But I didn\u0027t see him come out of the plane. When I looked up, he was already in the air.\"\\n\\n \"You reckon he was already dead?\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t considered that. \"Yes,\" I said slowly. \"Yes, I think he was. Because he was ...\" I had to take a deep breath. \"He was all floppy.\"\\n\\n Martin moved behind me and put his hands on my shoulders.\\n\\n Padgett Lanier shook his glass a little to hear the ice cubes tinkle against the sides. \"I wonder, when we turn the deceased over, if you all would mind taking a look at him.\" He held up a placatory hand before we could respond. \"I know, I know, it\u0027s an awful thing to ask anyone, especially these ladies, but we do need to know if you have seen this man anytime or anywhere, before today.\"\\n\\n I had never wanted to do anything less. My husband\u0027s hands gripped my shoulders bracingly.\\n\\n \"Sheriff! We\u0027re ready when you are!\" called the taller of the deputies, as he pulled on an extra pair of plastic gloves. Lanier heaved himself out of his chair and strode over to the body.\\n\\n This was a process I did not want to watch, and I covered my face with my hands. I heard some sounds I definitely didn\u0027t want to match to an image.\\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t bother, ladies,\" called Lanier. His voice was very unsteady. I wondered if I ought to tell him where the bathroom was. \"You needn\u0027t bother,\" he said again, in a lower voice. But the people in our yard were so quiet, it was easy to hear. \"I recognize him myself ... I think.\"\\n\\n I dropped my hands in amazement, caught a glimpse of what was being lifted from the lawn, and put them back up hurriedly.\\n\\n \"Who is it?\" Martin called, close to my ear.\\n\\n \"Detective Sergeant Jack Burns, City of Lawrenceton Police Department.\"\\n\\n Padgett Lanier, no doubt about it, had a certain sense of ceremony.\\n\\n After some dreadful minutes, the envelope of broken bones and jellied organs that was Jack Burns\u0027s body was maneuvered into a bag and then into the ambulance. Lanier, obviously shaken but still maintaining his official face, ambled over to the patio. I was feeling very shaky, and Angel was an interesting shade of green. I thought she might be sick again. Martin and Shelby looked even grimmer than they had before.\\n\\n \"How long has it been since you saw Jack Burns?\" Lanier asked me. \"Seems to me as though you and he never got along too well, am I right?\"\\n\\n \"I never had any quarrel with Mr. Burns,\" I said steadily. That was the truth. Jack Burns\u0027s dislike of me had not had its basis in any one incident, but in cumulative distrust. \"And I haven\u0027t seen him in- -maybe years.\" Which had been fine with me; I\u0027d feared Jack, with his blind zeal for his own brand of justice. It\u0027s bad to have a policeman as an enemy.\\n\\n \"And you, Mrs. Youngblood?\"\\n\\n \"We did have a run-in a couple of weeks ago,\" Angel said calmly, though her color betrayed her. I tried not to show any surprise.\\n\\n \"And just what was that about--?\"\\n\\n \"He ticketed my car downtown, for some completely bullshit city ordinance he\u0027d looked up in the books.\"\\n\\n \"Now why would he do that?\"\\n\\n Angel put her hands on her hips, and her arm muscles rippled. \"I came out of the bank and found him putting a ticket on my car and we had a little talk, kind of sharp.\"\\n\\n \"Anyone around during this little talk?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Angel said wearily. \"It was downtown on a Friday morning. I saw that man that works at the library with Roe--Perry Allison--and I saw that pretty round woman who works at Marcus Hatfield, the one with the dark hair who has the little girl.\"\\n\\n \"Carey Osland,\" Lanier decided.\\n\\n \"Right, if you say so.\" Angel seemed indifferent to the question of the woman\u0027s name.\\n\\n Martin looked at me, his eyebrows arched: Did you know about this? I shook my head almost imperceptibly.\\n\\n \"Why do you think, Mrs. Youngblood, that a detective sergeant would give a parking ticket?\"\\n\\n \"Because he thought it was Roe\u0027s car,\" Angel said bluntly. \"We both have blue Chevettes. Mine\u0027s the same age, I got it used. Though mine\u0027s a slightly different shade of blue, we basically have the same car.\"\\n\\n \"Did you have a conversation with Jack Burns?\"\\n\\n \"Not what you would call a conversation,\" Angel said dryly. \"He looked kind of taken aback when he saw it was my car, but then it was like he figured if I lived out here in Roe\u0027s garage apartment, giving me a ticket was almost as good as giving her one. And he was right, I probably was seven inches from the curb instead of six. But I wasn\u0027t in a good mood.\"\\n\\n This had been a real speech for Angel, who did not tend to be chatty. But Padgett Lanier wanted more.\\n\\n \"So you had words?\" he prodded her.\\n\\n Angel sighed. \"I asked him why he was giving me a ticket and he told me I was parked too far from the curb, and he asked me how Roe was doing, had she found any more bodies lately, and I told him he was giving me a bullshit ticket, and he said he was sure there was some ordinance still on the books about public bad language, and did I want to see if I could karate-chop my way out of a jail cell.\"\\n\\n Lanier stared at her, fascinated. \"And what did you say?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t respond?\"\\n\\n \"No point to it. He\u0027d decided he was going to give me the ticket.\"\\n\\n Lanier seemed nonplused. He eyed Angel a moment or two longer, then asked Martin if he\u0027d seen Jack Burns lately.\\n\\n \"The last time I saw Jack Burns was two years ago, about the time I met my wife,\" Martin said calmly. His fingers dug into the tight muscles of my neck and I tilted my head back.\\n\\n \"And you, Mr. Youngblood?\"\\n\\n \"Hadn\u0027t ever met him.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t mad about your wife getting a ticket?\"\\n\\n \"If you park seven inches from the curb, you gotta take what\u0027s coming to you.\"\\n\\n Padgett Lanier\u0027s pale face had a tendency to flush easily. We watched now with some trepidation as he turned a tomato red. The sheriff dismissed us curtly, and turned his attention to the search his men were making in our yard. I wanted to beg them not to trample my poor little just- plowed garden: but I decided that would be unfeeling.\\n\\n With the passage of a couple of hours, supper had become just possible. I called the Youngbloods\u0027 apartment to ask Shelby and Angel if they wanted to share our meal, but Angel said she\u0027d rather lie down than eat, and Shelby didn\u0027t want to leave her.\\n\\n Martin and I had pork chops, fried green tomatoes (a rare indulgence), Waldorf salad, and I\u0027d made some biscuits. But we were just picking at the food. Martin had been quiet throughout the meal, which was unusual. Normally, we talked to each other at the table, before we went about our separate pursuits in the evening. (Sometimes they were mutual pursuits, but that usually came later. About bedtime.)\\n\\n Our house felt very quiet after the onslaught of county and city police. We hadn\u0027t had that many people around since the last year\u0027s Christmas party.\\n\\n \"Roe, I\u0027m worried about this,\" Martin said finally. His pale brown eyes focused on me; Martin looks into the eyes of the people he\u0027s talking to. That can be intimidating, or exciting.\\n\\n \"I know. I am, too, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Not just Jack Burns being killed, but him being dumped here.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I said again, not understanding what Martin was getting at.\\n\\n \"As Sheriff Lanier pointed out, people know that you and he didn\u0027t get along.\"\\n\\n \"But I was absolutely, provably on the ground when he landed. So I couldn\u0027t have done it,\" I said dismissively. \"Besides which, I can\u0027t fly a plane.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something wrong about it.\" Martin was having some problem formulating his thoughts, unusual for him. He\u0027s used to expressing himself quickly and decisively in front of a lot of people.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to say \"Of course,\" again, but that was what I was thinking.\\n\\n \"How long has it been since you talked to him?\" Martin asked.\\n\\n \"The sheriff asked me that this afternoon. The best I can recall, I haven\u0027t seen Jack to speak to since ... two and a half years ago at the Anderton house. Same as you.\" The day Martin and I had met. He smiled at me now, warmly but briefly, to show me he, too, remembered that day very well.\\n\\n \"Did you think Angel reacted normally today?\" Martin said suddenly. \"No, I don\u0027t think so at all,\" I said, glad he\u0027d said it instead of me. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with her. Angel\u0027s not one to flinch away from anything unpleasant, and she has the strongest stomach of anyone I know. For some reason, this just threw her for a loop.\" And I remembered Jack Burns rotating in the air, and was sorry I\u0027d used that expression. I put my napkin by my plate and pushed the plate away.\\n\\n \"Something\u0027s up with her,\" Martin said. \"I could tell Shelby was worried, too. And I could swear he\u0027d never heard this story about the ticket.\"\\n\\n \"Would you mind doing the dishes tonight?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Martin seemed glad to shake off whatever dark thoughts he\u0027d been having. \"Are you going out? Is it Friends of the Library night, or some church meeting?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got to go pay my condolences to Bess Burns.\"\\n\\n \"Roe, do you think that\u0027s wise?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always liked her, even if I didn\u0027t like him. I\u0027ve gotten to know her at Friends meetings.\"\\n\\n Since I\u0027d resumed working at the library on a part-time basis, I\u0027d met everyone who worked there as a volunteer. And Bess Burns, since she\u0027d retired from teaching was one of our best workers.\\n\\n Martin continued to look at me in a troubled way, but he nodded. \"I don\u0027t mind doing the dishes,\" he said. \"Have you fed that cat yet?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do it before I go,\" I promised. Martin and Madeleine, the fat old cat I inherited from a friend, have a touchy relationship at best. Madeleine\u0027s favorite perch is the hood of Martin\u0027s Mercedes-Benz, and Martin is very proud of that car. We even got doors installed on the garage and we check to be sure they\u0027re closed every night, but we have to search for Madeleine before we do.\\n\\n I went up the stairs in a hurry, mentally selecting my visit-to-the-widow outfit. Not black, I wasn\u0027t a member of the family ... navy. My new navy blue dress with the white trim. I\u0027d just bought it at Short \u0027N Sweet in Atlanta--a petite shop, I\u0027m four eleven--and I glanced at the label, gloating over the smaller size I\u0027d been buying lately, before I pulled it over my head.\\n\\n Living with a health- and exercise-conscious man like Martin, and having the athletic Angel as a companion, had had a happy result as far as my figure was concerned. I\u0027d even gone to the beauty shop my mother patronizes, Clip Casa, and gotten Benita to streak my hair. It took hours, since it\u0027s thick, tightly wavy, and halfway down my back. But the result was worth it. Overall, what with being happy with Martin and secure financially, I looked and felt better than I had at any time in my life.\\n\\n After wiggling into pantyhose--a process I wouldn\u0027t let Martin watch--I slid my feet into pumps and pulled my frivolous streaky hair back with a barrette. I fed Madeleine hastily, grabbed my food offering from the refrigerator, and backed out my old Chevette, a car Martin detests almost as much as he detests Madeleine\u0027s paw prints.\\n\\n Though we live a mile out of town, I can almost see the back of my mother\u0027s house from my own backyard, and the Burns home was only one street south of hers. But it was a street that made a lot of difference; Mother\u0027s home on Plantation was a roomy two-story with a large lot, and Bess and Jack owned a fairly modest three-bedroom ranch.\\n\\n There were two cars parked in front of the Burns home, one of them a familiar blue Lincoln Continental. It would have taken Mother five minutes to walk, but she would never willingly arrive anywhere flushed with exertion. Mother was actually coming toward me with a bowl in her hand as I got out of my old car, clutching my own dish.\\n\\n \"What you got there?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"A cold pasta salad. It\u0027s all I had in the house to make.\"\\n\\n My mother, Aida Brattle Teagarden Queensland, is a slim, husky-voiced Lauren Bacall look- alike. She is also a very successful realtor, and a few short years ago she married John Queensland, a retired businessman. Since then, she\u0027s become a stepgrandmother a couple of times. Once the shock wore off, she\u0027s enjoyed it.\\n\\n I peered through the plastic wrap. \"Looks good.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. I see you brought your Waldorf salad. Well, are you going to ring the doorbell?\"\\n\\n I did so, and the door swung open after the correct interval. The Burns\u0027s neighbor to the right, Marva Clerrick, had on her formal smile. It changed into a less strained one when she recognized us.\\n\\n \"Am I glad to see you!\" she exclaimed in a violent whisper. \"The strangest people are here talking to Bess! I have no idea what\u0027s going on!\"\\n\\n Marva, an athletic extrovert and the wife of my sometime boss, Sam Clerrick, was one of the most popular teachers at Lawrenceton High School and a good friend of the recently retired Bess Burns. Marva had been aptly named by parents who must have had some premonition that Marva would be able to cook, teach English during the week and Sunday School at Western Hill Baptist Church, bring up two very good girls, and cope with the moody Sam. In the summer, her off-season, Marva taught swimming at the local pool and led rug-hooking classes at Peachtree Leisure Apartments.\\n\\n For Marva to be confounded by a situation, it must be strange indeed. Of course, we were agog.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked in a stage whisper.\\n\\n \"There are two men here I\u0027ve never seen before in this town,\" Marva hissed back. \"And to fall out of a plane! How could that happen by accident? What was Jack doing up in a plane?\"\\n\\n \"I hate to bring this up, but I think Jack was already dead when he came out of the plane,\" I said hesitantly. No one had asked me not to tell, and if Mother found out from another source she\u0027d never forgive me.\\n\\n \"Already dead?\" my mother said. She and Marva stared at me with twin expressions of distaste, fascination, and horror.\\n\\n \"He sure looked like it,\" I said, involuntarily seeing the body turning in the air. \"Of course, someone else was flying the plane.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, girl, you don\u0027t mean you saw it?\" Marva asked breathlessly.\\n\\n I nodded, surprised at this failure of the rumor mill.\\n\\n \"I heard it was that young woman that lives in your apartment out there, the gal with all the muscles,\" Marva said indignantly.\\n\\n \"Oh, we were both out in the backyard.\"\\n\\n \"Did you see the airplane, too?\" Mother asked.\\n\\n I shrugged. \"It was just a little ole plane, red and white. I didn\u0027t notice any of the numbers on it.\" It would be hard to find someone who knew less about airplanes than I did.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe it, in our little town,\" Marva said, forgetting to whisper. \"Maybe it was somebody Jack had sent to prison?\"\\n\\n Mother and I shrugged simultaneously, and shook our heads to back the shrug up.\\n\\n \"Well, see what you make of this situation here, and let me know,\" Marva said. \"I\u0027ve been minding the door for an hour now, but I have to go home soon, I\u0027ve got bread coming out of the oven and I don\u0027t know if Sissy will remember to get it out of the loaf pan after ten minutes\u0027 sitting.\"\\n\\n \"Where is Bess?\" my mother asked directly, tired of all this hissing by the front door.\\n\\n \"Straight through,\" Marva said, nodding her head at the door at the rear of the foyer. \"The kids haven\u0027t gotten here yet, but she\u0027s talked to both of them on the phone. They have long drives.\" I remembered the Burns children, Jack Junior and Romney, went to different colleges in different states.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll put our bowls in the refrigerator before we talk to her,\" Mother told Marva firmly.\\n\\n Bess\u0027s kitchen looked just like mine usually did, basically clean but messy around the edges, with bills sticking out of a letter caddy on the wall and an open box of teabags by a pitcher. Another neighbor was working out her helpful impulses by wiping the counter, and we smiled and nodded at each other in a subdued way.\\n\\n I opened the refrigerator to put in my offering. It was half-full of similar dishes, plastic- wrapped food that people had brought to Bess Burns in her time of trouble, to help feed her surely incoming family. By noon tomorrow, there would be no available shelf space.\\n\\n Somehow reassured by the correctness of the refrigerator, Mother and I made our way to the den at the back of the house.\\n\\n Bess was sitting on the couch with two big men flanking her. I\u0027d never seen either man before. They wore suits, and ties, and grim expressions, and as the slim red-haired widow blotted her face with a white handkerchief, they offered her no comfort.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re so sorry,\" Mother said, in a perfectly calibrated tone of sympathy calculated not to start the tears again.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Bess said. Bess\u0027s voice was almost expressionless from exhaustion and shock. The lines across her forehead and from nose to mouth looked deeper, and traces of red lipstick stood out garishly on her pale face. \"I appreciate you coming, and Aurora, too,\" Bess said with great effort.\\n\\n I bent awkwardly across the coffee table to give her a hug. Bess, who had only retired at the end of the previous school year, was still wearing her schoolteacher clothes, one of those relaxed cotton knit pants sets with the loose tunic. Hers was blue with a giant red apple on the front. It seemed ludicrously cheerful.\\n\\n \"Do they know why, yet--?\" my mother said, as if she had a perfect right to ask. Bess actually opened her mouth to answer, when the blond man to her right held up a hand to silence her. He stared up at us from behind tortoise-shell-framed glasses.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s still under investigation,\" he said heavily.\\n\\n Mother and I glanced at each other.\\n\\n Mother was not to be bested on her own territory. \"I am Aida Queensland, a neighbor,\" she said pointedly. \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve met you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m John Dryden from Atlanta,\" he said, which was an answer that told us nothing.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like people being rude to my mother.\\n\\n \"You would be Mr. Pope, then,\" I said to the other man, who was darker and younger.\\n\\n \"Pope?\" He stared at me curiously. \"No. I\u0027m Don O\u0027Riley. From Atlanta.\"\\n\\n Though Mother was trying to give me a censorious face, she was really stifling a smile.\\n\\n \"Bess, why don\u0027t you come with us out to the kitchen?\" I said. \"Show us what we should put out for you and your friends to eat.\" They clearly weren\u0027t friends, and whoever they were, they were upsetting Bess even more than she already was. \"It\u0027s so late, and I\u0027m sure you haven\u0027t had a thing.\"\\n\\n \"No, I haven\u0027t eaten,\" she said, looking as though she liked being talked to directly. Before her two \"friends\" could stop her, she stood up and circled the coffee table to go to the kitchen with us.\\n\\n The neighbor who\u0027d been there had left, leaving behind spotless counters and a feeling of goodwill. Bess stood and stared as though she didn\u0027t recognize her own appliances.\\n\\n \"Were they bothering you?\" Mother asked.\\n\\n \"They have to, it\u0027s their job,\" Bess said, with the weary endurance of a law enforcement wife. \"I shouldn\u0027t say anything about this, but Jack knew the identity of a--person--here in town who\u0027s been hidden ... well, I better not say anymore. They wonder if it might be related to his being killed.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Mother with great significance, which was more than I could think of to say. She turned to fiddle with a dish of spaghetti she\u0027d gotten from the refrigerator, and I saw her eyes close as if she was wondering how in the hell she\u0027d gotten into this kitchen hearing this fascinating but bizarre revelation.\\n\\n \"You saw him fall, Roe,\" Bess said directly to me. The air of exhaustion was gone, and in its place was a dreadful intensity. \"Was he dead when he fell, or did he die from the impact?\"\\n\\n \"I think he was dead when he came out of the plane,\" I said, trying not to cry in the face of her pain, since she was keeping her own tears in check. \"I don\u0027t think he felt a thing, or ever knew he was falling.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" she said quietly.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Burns, here you are,\" said the blond Mr. Dryden sharply, though he could have had little doubt about Bess\u0027s location. He was tucking his glasses into his breast pocket. Without them, his face looked even more alert. \"You have a phone call you need to take in the living room. Ladies, thanks for coming to see Mrs. Burns in her time of grief.\"\\n\\n None of us had heard the phone ring.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll just set your meal out, and then we\u0027ll leave,\" Mother said firmly. \"Bess, if you need us, we\u0027ll be right here.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks so much,\" John Dryden said--dryly. And damned if he didn\u0027t stay in the kitchen, watching us get out paper plates (since we couldn\u0027t feature Dryden and O\u0027Riley helping with the dishes) and heat up spaghetti in the built-in microwave. We prepared three plates of spaghetti, Waldorf salad, and green bean casserole, and set the table as best we could, what with having to search for the forks and napkins and glasses.\\n\\n \"Mr. Dryden,\" said my mother, as he escorted us to the front door without our having caught another glimpse of Bess, \"can you tell us when the funeral will be, and the name of the funeral home? I need to arrange for some flowers.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe we\u0027re certain at this time about any of that,\" Dryden said cautiously. \"There has to be an autopsy.\"\\n\\n So Dryden was a stranger to Bess Burns, if not to Jack. Any Lawrenceton native would know the Burns\u0027s burials would be from Jasper Funeral Home, since Jerry Saylor of Saylor\u0027s Funeral Home had divorced Bess Burns\u0027s sister. From the way Mother and I looked at each other, Dryden knew he\u0027d said something significant; you could see him trying to figure it out, abandoning the attempt.\\n\\n \"I suppose the funeral date will be in the obituary in tomorrow\u0027s paper?\" my mother persisted.\\n\\n He looked blank.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure it will be,\" he said. We didn\u0027t believe him for a minute.\\n\\n \"Jack Junior and Romney had better get home quick,\" my mother said darkly as she slid her elegant legs into her car.\\n\\n I drove home slowly, more questions in my mind than I\u0027d had when I\u0027d set out. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5/page-1.html","bookId":2240,"book":{"id":2240,"title":"Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #5) \\n What\u0027s the world coming to - when you can\u0027t relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden? Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department\u0027s finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe\u0027s friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe\u0027s feet. Roe\u0027s husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It\u0027s only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe\u0027s yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:29 PM"}}
