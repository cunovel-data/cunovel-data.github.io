{"id":2240,"title":"Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead Over Heels (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #5) \\n What\u0027s the world coming to - when you can\u0027t relax with an ice-cold beverage in your own backyard without a body falling from the sky and landing in your garden? Part-time librarian and frequent amateur investigator Roe Teagarden has good reason to ask herself this question when the remains of one of the Lawrenceton, Georgia police department\u0027s finest catapults into her flower bed one beautiful sunny morning. Roe\u0027s friend and bodyguard, the long-legged, bikini-clad Angel Youngblood, is mowing the grass and Roe is reclining on a lounger when a small red-and-white plane flies low overhead and drops its unlikely debris more or less at Roe\u0027s feet. Roe\u0027s husband of two years, wealthy businessman Martin Bartell, immediately wonders if the killer chose his dumping place to send some kind of message to Roe. And the mystery deepens when two federal agents arrive in town to investigate the murder. It\u0027s only when Madeleine the cat provides a clue that Roe and Martin realize Roe herself may be in danger and that using Roe\u0027s yard as a temporary landfill for dead bodies was no accident.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-over-heels-aurora-teagarden-5.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
