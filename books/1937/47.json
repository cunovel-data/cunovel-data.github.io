I mean, Reed would’ve been a legal heir once paternity was established.”\\n\\n “I wondered why you hadn’t.”\\n\\n “Well, it was for a very good reason. Reed isn’t Robert’s son.”\\n\\n Anne Marie’s heart soared with relief and, even more than that, with joy.\\n\\n “I didn’t know Robert all that well,” Rebecca told her. “But I know one thing about him—he loved you.”\\n\\n “He loved me,” Anne Marie said.\\n\\n “He did,” Rebecca concurred with a smile.\\n\\n That was all that mattered. Robert wasn’t going to win any Husband of the Year award. The pain of his betrayal would always be with her but he’d loved her. It was what she’d known all along, despite the doubts and the mistakes they’d both made.\\n\\n Yes, that was all that mattered.\\n\\n The past wouldn’t change.\\n\\n But the way Anne Marie saw the future would.\\n\\n Chapter 33\\n\\n Lillie estimated that it’d been three weeks since Hector had received her letter. She hadn’t heard from him, and after all this time, she didn’t expect to. The last thing she wanted was to cause problems between Hector and his children.\\n\\n After mailing the letter, Lillie had spent a week by the ocean and found solace. The ocean had always been her escape. Whenever she learned about another of David’s affairs, she’d booked a visit to her favorite ocean resort. She’d gone there three or four times every year, often enough that she had her own room, and the staff knew her by her first name. Although it’d been well over three years since her last visit, she’d been greeted warmly. Her regular room was ready and waiting for her.\\n\\n She’d regained her emotional equilibrium walking along the beach. Every morning, she’d strolled in the sand, letting the waves lap against her bare feet, thinking, meditating, praying. After a while, the ache would gradually diminish as she was reminded that her worth as a woman, as a human being, didn’t depend on David. His actions couldn’t demean her. Her husband, sad though it was to admit, was a man without honor.\\n\\n When she returned from the ocean, Lillie carefully sorted through the mail, searching for a response from Hector. There was none. She’d hoped he’d answer her note, although she hadn’t really expected it.\\n\\n On Monday, the twelfth of May, Lillie spent the morning working in her garden. She loved her Martha Washington geraniums, and with the rhododendrons in full bloom and the azaleas as well, her garden had never looked better. Her neighbors hired landscape specialists and Lillie had a company that performed the more demanding physical tasks, such as mowing. The flower beds, however, were her domain. Her personal joy.\\n\\n At noon, she took a break and went inside for a glass of iced tea. The mail had been delivered and, as she drank, she leafed through the few advertisements and set the bills aside. A hand-addressed envelope caught her attention.\\n\\n She didn’t immediately recognize the writing. Curious, she opened it to discover an invitation to a retirement party for Hector Silva.\\n\\n Lillie read it twice.\\n\\n The party was planned for that very evening and when she studied the handwriting a second time, she realized the envelope had been personally addressed to her by Hector. She recognized his penmanship from the work order on her car.\\n\\n All the necessary details were there. Date. Time. Place.\\n\\n Lillie inhaled sharply. The party would be held at the dealership at seven that night, and she had every intention of attending.\\n\\n By six forty-five, Lillie was dressed in a semiformal knee-length linen dress with a cropped jacket. Barbie phoned just as she was about to walk out the door and Lillie explained where she was going.\\n\\n “I was sure Hector would be in touch,” her daughter said in that gleeful way of hers when she knew she was right. “Have a wonderful evening, Mom.”\\n\\n “I will,” Lillie promised.\\n\\n They spoke for a few more minutes and then it was time for Lillie to go. Although she was nervous, she had a strong intuition that this was going to be one of the most magical evenings of her life. Happiness spread through her and she felt so light it was as though she could float.\\n\\n When Lillie arrived at the dealership, the retirement party was in full swing. The showroom floor was decorated with banners and balloons, the counters spread with bottles of champagne and trays of lovely hors d’oeuvres. Surrounded by his children, customers and coworkers, Hector didn’t see her right away. As soon as he did, his eyes flew wide open and he said something to his daughter, whom Lillie recognized from the photographs she’d seen in his home. Hector broke away from the group and hurried toward her.\\n\\n “Lillie.” He held out both hands.\\n\\n “Hello, Hector.”\\n\\n “I’m so pleased you came.” His gaze seemed to devour her, and she couldn’t doubt the sincerity of his words.\\n\\n Her own eyes were equally hungry for him. “Thank you for the invitation, and congratulations on your retirement.” Words hardly seemed necessary. All she wanted to do was stare at him.\\n\\n “Thank you.” His hands firmly clasped hers. Then, as if he’d forgotten himself, he asked, “Can I get you some champagne?”\\n\\n “I’d like that.”\\n\\n But Hector didn’t need to leave her. Rita, his daughter, brought over a champagne flute and offered it to Lillie.\\n\\n “I’m Rita,” she said unnecessarily.\\n\\n “You’re as lovely as your pictures,” Lillie said as she accepted the flute and impulsively hugged his daughter. Rita hugged her back, her expression welcoming.\\n\\n “This is Andy, my fiancé,” she said, introducing the man at her side. “Dad wasn’t sure you’d come. I told him you would.”\\n\\n “I don’t think I could’ve stayed away if I’d tried,” Lillie confessed.\\n\\n Hector stood close by as his two sons, Manuel and Luis, walked toward them, their progress hindered by the crowd. Manuel studied Lillie, his eyes devoid of emotion; that, to her way of thinking, was an improvement over the hostility he’d shown at their previous meeting. A lovely red-haired young woman—obviously pregnant—was with him.\\n\\n “You came,” Manuel said, not bothering with any form of greeting.\\n\\n “Manuel,” Hector warned in low tones. “I won’t have you disrespecting Lillie.”\\n\\n His oldest son conceded with a nod. “Welcome, Ms. Higgins,” he said. He introduced his wife, Colleen.\\n\\n “Thank you, Manuel. Nice to meet you, Colleen. Both of you, please call me Lillie.”\\n\\n “This is my son Luis,” Hector said, gesturing toward the second young man.\\n\\n Luis and Lillie exchanged a friendly greeting under Hector’s watchful eye—and Manuel’s.\\n\\n “You made my father very happy by accepting his invitation,” Manuel told her when Luis had drifted off to talk to someone else.\\n\\n “He made me happy by sending it to me.”\\n\\n Manuel gave her a tentative smile.\\n\\n Lillie smiled back. She hoped that in time the two of them could be friends.\\n\\n “We’re all going to dinner after the party,” Hector said, leaning closer. “Can you join us?”\\n\\n Lillie readily agreed.\\n\\n “Allow me to introduce you to my friends,” Hector said and led her away. As they moved from one group to another, she became even more aware of how greatly he was respected and loved. His coworkers told story after story about Hector, embarrassing him since he was a modest man. Lillie enjoyed every word. If she needed confirmation that this man was everything she’d imagined, then she received it tonight, many times over.\\n\\n The party started to break up at about eight-thirty. She’d remained at Hector’s side, either clasping his hand or with his arm about her waist. There could be no doubt that they were together.\\n\\n At the Mexican restaurant a little later, Lillie met more members of his family. A brother and sister, nieces and nephews, various in-laws. The table seated at least thirty, and the names flew past her, although she made a determined effort to remember each one. She sat between Hector and Manuel.\\n\\n Music and laughter filled the room. Children ducked under the table and raced around the chairs while their parents—Hector’s nieces and nephews—did their best to contain them. Although Hector introduced Lillie to everyone in his extended family, it seemed they already knew her. They accepted her without question and seemed genuinely pleased to make her acquaintance.\\n\\n When the food arrived, it was served family style. Manuel passed Lillie the first dish, holding the heavy platter of rice while she helped herself. Next came chilaquites, which seemed to be some kind of tortilla casserole, followed by corn tamales, chili rellenos and another dish Lillie didn’t hear the name of.\\n\\n “My father’s in love with you,” Manuel said quietly.\\n\\n “I beg your pardon?”\\n\\n “He showed me your letter. You love him, too, don’t you?”\\n\\n Lillie could see no reason to deny it. “Very much.”\\n\\n “He’s a man of strong feelings,” Manuel said. “His family is important to him.”\\n\\n “I know.” That was the reason she’d decided to break off the relationship; she refused to place Hector in the impossible position of choosing between his family and her.\\n\\n Manuel acknowledged her statement. “Yes. He was willing to give you up for our—my sake.”\\n\\n “He already had.” She couldn’t resist asking, “Can you tell me what changed?”\\n\\n Rita slapped her brother’s arm. “Hey, Manuel, what’s the holdup here? You’re supposed to be passing the food.”\\n\\n “Sorry.” Manuel handed the dish to his sister.\\n\\n “I’ve never seen my father this miserable,” Manuel informed Lillie.\\n\\n “Even when Mom was ill, the entire family counted on our father to keep up our spirits and he did. He nursed Mom, cared for her, held her when she breathed her last and loved her to the very end.”\\n\\n “He still loves her.” Lillie blinked hard as tears welled up in her eyes. This was how she wanted to be loved.\\n\\n “After Mom died it was Dad who held our family together. Don’t misunderstand me—he grieved for our mother. But her death was also a release from terrible pain. Dad understood that better than anyone. He was lonely and lost but he found ways to cope. Through work, family—and now you.”\\n\\n Mesmerized by Manuel’s words, Lillie passed plate after plate without serving herself.\\n\\n “After receiving your letter, my father wept.” Luis, who’d been listening avidly, spoke from across the table while Hector was busy talking to a nephew on his other side.\\n\\n “He…did?”\\n\\n Manuel frowned at him, but he acknowledged Luis’s words. “It’s true.” He paused to take a gulp of his Corona. “I knew then that you were no ordinary woman,” he resumed, “and that I’d made a mistake. If my father loves you, then I need to be willing to look past my own prejudices and give you a chance, as well.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-47.html","bookId":1937,"book":{"id":1937,"title":"Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5)","description":"Storyline: Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5) \\n What do you want most in the world? \\n What Anne Marie Roche wants is to find happiness again.
