{"id":65828,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Now that a knitting class apparently wasn’t a sure thing, Anne Marie was shocked at how discouraged she felt. One roadblock, and she was ready to pack it in. Less than a year ago, hardly anything seemed to defeat her, but these days even the most mundane problems were disheartening.\\n\\n At least Baxter’s needs were straightforward and easily met, and he viewed her with unwavering devotion. There was comfort in that.\\n\\n Eager to start her scrapbook project, she got to work. The three-ring binder was black with a clear plastic cover. For the next thirty minutes she cut out letters, decorated them with glitter glue and pasted them on a bright pink sheet. Then she slipped it behind the cover so the front of the binder read TWENTY WISHES. In addition to the binder, Anne Marie had purchased twenty plastic folders, one for each wish.\\n\\n She became so involved in her work that it was well past one before she realized she hadn’t eaten lunch. She emptied a can of soup into a bowl, and it was heating in the microwave when her phone rang.\\n\\n Startled, she picked up the receiver on the first ring. The beeper went off at the same time, indicating that her meal was ready.\\n\\n “Hello,” she said, cradling the phone against her shoulder as she opened the microwave. She rarely got calls at home anymore. In the weeks after Robert’s funeral, she’d heard from a number of couples they’d been friends with, but those people had gradually drifted away. Anne Marie hadn’t made the effort to keep in touch, either. It was easier to lose herself in her grief than to reach out to others.\\n\\n “Anne Marie, it’s Lillie. Guess what?” her friend said breathlessly.\\n\\n “What?” Hearing the excitement in Lillie’s voice lifted her own spirits.\\n\\n “Remember what you said Valentine’s night?”\\n\\n Anne Marie frowned. “Not exactly. I said various things. Which one do you mean?”\\n\\n “Oh, you know. Elise was talking about eating something to feel better and then someone else—me, I think—brought up volunteering and you said…” She giggled. “You asked why we couldn’t just buy ourselves something.”\\n\\n Anne Marie smiled. She’d been joking at the time, but it appeared that Lillie had taken her seriously. “Are you about to tell me you bought yourself something?”\\n\\n “I sure did,” Lillie said gleefully.\\n\\n “Well, don’t leave me in suspense. What did you get?”\\n\\n Lillie giggled again. “A brand-new shiny red convertible.”\\n\\n “No!” Anne Marie feigned shock.\\n\\n “Yes. Can you imagine me at sixty-three buying myself a sports car?”\\n\\n “What kind is it?” Anne Marie knew next to nothing about cars, which was why she belonged to Triple A. In truth, Robert had been pretty helpless, too.\\n\\n “A BMW.”\\n\\n It must’ve been expensive; Anne Marie knew that much. Well, Lillie could afford it. The perfume company had been more than generous to her and Barbie after the plane crash, and they were both financially secure.\\n\\n “Want to go for a ride?”\\n\\n Anne Marie’s first inclination was to decline. Almost immediately she changed her mind. Why not go? Lillie’s excitement was so contagious, she couldn’t resist joining in.\\n\\n “I’d love to,” she said warmly.\\n\\n “Great. I’ll meet you in front of the bookstore in twenty minutes.”\\n\\n “Uh, what about Jacqueline?” She knew Lillie had plenty of other friends and that she and Jacqueline Donovan were especially close. They’d raised their children together, belonged to the same country club and were active members of several charitable organizations. Jacqueline, too, was a frequent customer at Blossom Street Books, not to mention all the other neighborhood stores.\\n\\n “Rest assured, she’ll get her turn,” Lillie told her. “So, do you want to go for a ride or not?”\\n\\n “I do. I just thought…never mind. I’d love to ride in your shiny new red convertible.”\\n\\n Gulping down her soup and then grabbing her coat, Anne Marie waited outside by the curb. Lillie pulled up right on time. The car, a convertible, was certainly bright red, and it shone from fender to fender. Despite the overcast skies, her friend had the top down.\\n\\n Anne Marie stepped forward, gawking at the vehicle. “Lillie, it’s fabulous!”\\n\\n The older woman grinned. “I think so, too.”\\n\\n “What did Barbie have to say?”\\n\\n Lillie shook her head. “She doesn’t know yet. No one does. I’d just driven it off the showroom floor when I called you.”\\n\\n “Why me?”\\n\\n “You’re the one who inspired the idea. So it’s only fitting that you be the first one to ride in it.”\\n\\n Anne Marie remembered the “eat something,” “do something” conversation, but she never would’ve guessed she’d end up riding in a brand-new BMW because of it.\\n\\n “It’s the first time in my life that I’ve purchased my own car. I negotiated the deal myself,” Lillie announced proudly. “And I had all my facts straight before I even walked inside. Those salesmen take one look at me and see dollar signs. I needed to prove to them—and to myself—that I’m no pushover.”\\n\\n “I’m sure you did—and then some.”\\n\\n Lillie nodded. “I got on the Internet and found a Web site that showed the invoice price, and then broke out the dealer’s typical overheads and advertising costs.”\\n\\n Anne Marie was more impressed by the minute. “You really did your research.”\\n\\n “My dear, you can find out just about anything on the Internet.” She raised her eyebrows. “I also discovered that the dealer cost includes a holdback for profit.” Lillie smiled roguishly as she continued her story. “The salesman was a charming fellow, I will say that. He expected to walk away with a substantial commission check, but I quickly disavowed him of that notion.”\\n\\n Anne Marie stared at her, astonished. “How did you do it?”\\n\\n “We started negotiating and I had him at the point of accepting my offer when I remembered that dealers sometimes get incentives and rebates on cars sold.”\\n\\n “You mentioned that, too?”\\n\\n “Darn right I did and he agreed to my terms.”\\n\\n “Lillie, congratulations.” Anne Marie had no idea the older woman had such a head for business. As far as she was aware, Lillie hadn’t worked a day in her life, or at least not outside the home. In many ways Barbie was a younger version of her mother. Both women had married young, and each had chosen a husband ten or so years her senior. That was something Anne Marie had in common with them; the fact that they were both mothers was not. They’d promptly delivered the requisite child, in Barbie’s case, twin sons. If Anne Marie recalled correctly, the Foster boys, Eric and Kurt, were enrolled in separate East Coast schools—very elite ones, naturally.\\n\\n “It feels so good to drive a vehicle I negotiated for myself,” Lillie said. “And this came about because of you.”\\n\\n “Really, I just made an offhand comment.”\\n\\n “It’s more than purchasing my own car,” she said, as though Anne Marie hadn’t spoken, “it was managing everything myself instead of handing the task over to someone else. I’ve always felt I could be a good businesswoman if I’d been given the opportunity.” She rubbed her hand over the arc of the steering wheel. “No one seemed to consider me capable of running my own affairs. Ironically, the person I needed to convince most was me. Thanks to you, I did.”\\n\\n Anne Marie felt a bit uncomfortable; Lillie was giving her far more credit than she deserved.\\n\\n “Come on,” Lillie said. “Get in.”\\n\\n Swinging open the passenger door, Anne Marie climbed into the convertible and fastened her seat belt.\\n\\n Lillie gripped the steering wheel tightly, throwing back her head. “I have to tell you, I’m really getting into this Twenty Wishes thing.”\\n\\n “I am, too,” Anne Marie said. “When you phoned I was in the middle of making a scrapbook, a page for each wish. I’m going to cut out magazine pictures to visualize them and to document the various steps.”\\n\\n Lillie turned to smile at her. “What a great idea.”\\n\\n The praise encouraged her and Anne Marie quickly went on to describe the craft-store supplies she’d purchased. “I don’t have much of a list as yet, but I’m working on it. How about you?”\\n\\n Lillie was silent for a moment. “I’ve decided I want to fall in love.” She spoke with a determination Anne Marie had never heard from her.\\n\\n “Barbie said the same thing at our Valentine’s party,” Anne Marie pointed out.\\n\\n “I know.”\\n\\n Anne Marie waited.\\n\\n “I’ve had plenty of men ask me out,” Lillie told her. “I don’t mean to sound egotistical, but I’m not interested in most of them.”\\n\\n Anne Marie nodded, not surprised that “plenty of men” would find Lillie attractive.\\n\\n “I’ve learned a thing or two in the last sixty-odd years,” Lillie was saying, “and I’m not as impressed with riches or connections as I once was. When I fall in love, I want it to be with a man of integrity. Someone who’s decent and kind and—” She paused as though searching for the right word. “Honorable. I want to fall in love with an honorable man.” She seemed embarrassed at having spoken her wish aloud, and leaned forward to start the engine. “As you might’ve guessed, my marriage—unlike my daughter’s—wasn’t a particularly good one. I don’t want to repeat the mistakes I made when I was younger.” The car roared to life, then purred with the sound of a flawlessly tuned engine.\\n\\n Checking behind her, Lillie backed out of the parking space on Blossom Street. From there they headed toward the freeway on-ramp. Lillie proposed a drive through the Kent Valley and along the Green River, and Anne Marie agreed.\\n\\n Closing her eyes, Anne Marie let the cold February wind sweep past her. Lillie turned on the radio just as the DJ announced a hit from the late 1960s. Soon she was crooning along to The Lovin’ Spoonful’s “Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind.” Anne Marie remembered her mother singing that song as a girl. Perhaps it was unusual to find herself good friends with a woman who was her mother’s contemporary. Sadly, although Anne Marie was an only child, she and her mother weren’t close. Her parents had divorced when she was in sixth grade, and the bitterness, especially on her mother’s part, had lingered through the years. It didn’t help that Anne Marie resembled her father. She’d had little contact with him after the divorce, and he died in a boating accident on Lake Washington when she was twenty-five. Her mother had never remarried.\\n\\n Because they had such an uneasy relationship, Anne Marie avoided frequent visits home. She made a point of calling her mother at least once a month. Even then, it seemed they didn’t have much to discuss. Sad as it was to admit, Anne Marie had more in common with Lillie than she did with her own mother.\\n\\n As Lillie’s voice grew louder, Anne Marie stayed quiet, afraid that if she attempted to sing she’d embarrass herself. After about twenty minutes, Lillie exited the freeway and drove toward the road that ran beside the banks of the Green River. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-4.html","bookId":1937,"book":{"id":1937,"title":"Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5)","description":"Storyline: Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5) \\n What do you want most in the world? \\n What Anne Marie Roche wants is to find happiness again.
