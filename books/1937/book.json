{"id":1937,"title":"Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5)","description":"Storyline: Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5) \\n What do you want most in the world? \\n What Anne Marie Roche wants is to find happiness again. At thirty-eight, she\u0027s childless, a recent widow, alone. She owns a successful bookstore on Seattle\u0027s Blossom Street, but despite her accomplishments, there\u0027s a feeling of emptiness. \\n On Valentine\u0027s Day, Anne Marie and several other widows get together to celebrate…hope. They each begin a list of twenty wishes—things they always wanted to do but never did. \\n Anne Marie\u0027s list includes learning to knit, falling in love again, doing good for someone else. When she volunteers at a local school, an eight-year-old girl named Ellen enters her life. It\u0027s a relationship that becomes far more involving—and far more important—than Anne Marie had ever imagined. \\n As Ellen helps Anne Marie complete her list of twenty wishes, they both learn that wishes can come true…but not necessarily in the way you expect.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
