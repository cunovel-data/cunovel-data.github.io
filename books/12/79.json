He was angry because, for one thing, he was hungry. \\n\\n His attempt to reach Sunmaster Fourteen was deflected by someone who insisted that Sunmaster could not be disturbed. \\n\\n \"Why not?\" Seldon had asked waspishly. \\n\\n \"Obviously, there is no need to answer that question,\" came back a cold voice. \\n\\n \"We were not brought here to be prisoners,\" said Seldon with equal coldness. \"Nor to starve.\" \\n\\n \"Im sure you have a kitchen and ample supplies of food.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, we do,\" said Seldon. \"And I do not know how to use the kitchen devices, nor do I know how to prepare the food. Do you eat it raw, fry it, boil it, roast it ?\" \\n\\n \"I cant believe you are ignorant in such matters.\" \\n\\n Dors, who had been pacing up and down during this colloquy, reached for the device and Seldon fended her off, whispering, \"Hell break the connection if a woman tries to speak to him.\" \\n\\n Then, into the device, he said more firmly than ever, \"What you believe or dont believe doesnt matter to me in the least. You send someone here--someone who can do something about our situation--or when I reach Sunmaster Fourteen, as I will eventually, you will pay for this.\" \\n\\n Nevertheless, it was two hours before someone arrived (by which time Seldon was in a state of savagery and Dors had grown rather desperate in her attempt to soothe him). \\n\\n The newcomer was a young man whose bald pate was slightly freckled and who probably would have been a redhead otherwise. \\n\\n He was bearing several pots and he seemed about to explain them when he suddenly looked uneasy and turned his back on Seldon in alarm. \"Tribesman,\" he said, obviously agitated. \"Your skincap is not well adjusted.\" \\n\\n Seldon, whose impatience had reached the breaking point, said, \"That doesnt bother me.\" \\n\\n Dors, however, said, \"Let me adjust it, Hari. Its just a bit too high here on the left side.\" \\n\\n Seldon then growled, \"You can turn now, young man. What is your name?\" \\n\\n \"I am Graycloud Five,\" said the Mycogenian uncertainly as he turned and looked cautiously at Seldon. \"I am a novitiate. I have brought a meal for you.\" He hesitated. \"From my own kitchen, where my woman prepared it, tribesman.\" He put the pots down on the table and Seldon raised one lid and sniffed the contents suspiciously. He looked up at Dors in surprise. \\n\\n \"You know, it doesnt smell bad.\" \\n\\n Dors nodded. \"Youre right. I can smell it too.\" \\n\\n Graycloud said, \"Its not as hot as it ought to be. It cooled off in transport. You must have crockery and cutlery in your kitchen.\" \\n\\n Dors got what was needed, and after they had eaten, largely and a bit greedily, Seldon felt civilized once more. \\n\\n Dors, who realized that the young man would feel unhappy at being alone with a woman and even unhappier if she spoke to him, found that, by default, it fell to her to carry the pots and dishes into the kitchen and wash them--once she deciphered the controls of the washing device. \\n\\n Meanwhile, Seldon asked the local time and said, somewhat abashed, \"You mean its the middle of the night?\" \\n\\n \"Indeed, tribesman,\" said Graycloud. \"Thats why it took a while to satisfy your need.\" \\n\\n Seldon understood suddenly why Sunmaster could not be disturbed and thought of Grayclouds woman having to be awakened to prepare him a meal and felt his conscience gnaw at him. \"Im sorry,\" he said. \"We are only tribespeople and we didnt know how to use the kitchen or how to prepare the food. In the morning, could you have someone arrive to instruct us properly?\" \\n\\n \"The best I can do, tribesmen,\" said Graycloud placatingly, \"is to have two Sisters sent in. I ask your pardon for inconveniencing you with feminine presence, but it is they who know these things.\" \\n\\n Dors, who had emerged from the kitchen, said (before remembering her place in the masculine Mycogenian society), \"Thats fine, Graycloud. Wed love to meet the Sisters.\" \\n\\n Graycloud looked at her uneasily and fleetingly, but said nothing. \\n\\n Seldon, convinced that the young Mycogenian would, on principle, refuse to have heard what a woman said to him, repeated the remark. \"Thats fine, Graycloud. Wed love to meet the Sisters.\" \\n\\n His expression cleared at once. \"I will have them here as soon as it is day.\" \\n\\n When Graycloud had left, Seldon said with some satisfaction, \"The Sisters are likely to be exactly what we need.\" \\n\\n \"Indeed? And in what way, Hari?\" asked Dors. \\n\\n \"Well, surely if we treat them as though they are human beings, they will be grateful enough to speak of their legends.\" \\n\\n \"If they know them,\" said Dors skeptically. \"Somehow I have no faith that the Mycogenians bother to educate their women very well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46312.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
