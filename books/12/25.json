{"id":317,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Hummins practiced eye seemed to take in the recess, the other taxis, the diner, the walkways, and the men and women all at a glance. Seldon, trying to look inconspicuous and again not knowing how, watched him, trying not to do so too intently. \\n\\n When they sat down at a small table and punched in their orders, Seldon, attempting to sound indifferent, said, \"Everything okay?\" \\n\\n \"Seems so,\" said Hummin. \\n\\n \"How can you tell?\" \\n\\n Hummin let his dark eyes rest on Seldon for a moment. \"Instinct,\" he said. \"Years of news gathering. You look and know, No news here. \" \\n\\n Seldon nodded and felt relieved. Hummin might have said it sardonically, but there must be a certain amount of truth to it. His satisfaction did not last through the first bite of his sandwich. He looked up at Hummin with his mouth full and with a look of hurt surprise on his face. \\n\\n Hummin said, \"This is a wayside diner, my friend. Cheap, fast, and not very good. The foods homegrown and has an infusion of rather sharp yeast. Trantorian palates are used to it.\" \\n\\n Seldon swallowed with difficulty. \"But back in the hotel--\" \\n\\n \"You were in the Imperial Sector, Seldon. Food is imported there and where microfood is used it is high-quality. It is also expensive.\" \\n\\n Seldon wondered whether to take another bite. \"You mean that as long as I stay on Trantor--\" \\n\\n Hummin made a hushing motion with his lips. \"Dont give anyone the impression that youre used to better. There are places on Trantor where to be identified as an aristocrat is worse than being identified as an Outworlder. The food wont be so bad everywhere, I assure you. These wayside places have a reputation for low quality. If you can stomach that sandwich, youll be able to eat anywhere on Trantor. And it wont hurt you. Its not decayed or bad or anything like that. It just has a harsh, strong taste and, honestly, you may grow accustomed to it. Ive met Trantorians who spit out honest food and say it lacks that homegrown tang.\" \\n\\n \"Do they grow much food on Trantor?\" asked Seldon. A quick side glance showed him there was no one seated in the immediate vicinity and he spoke quietly. \"Ive always heard it takes twenty surrounding worlds to supply the hundreds of freight ships required to feed Trantor every day.\" \\n\\n \"I know. And hundreds to carry off the load of wastes. And if you want to make the story really good, you say that the same freight ships carry food one way and waste the other. Its true that we import considerable quantities of food, but thats mostly luxury items. And we export considerable waste, carefully treated into inoffensiveness, as important organic fertilizer--every bit as important to other worlds as the food is to us. But thats only a small fraction of the whole.\" \\n\\n \"It is?\" \\n\\n \"Yes. In addition to fish in the sea, there are gardens and truck farms everywhere. And fruit trees and poultry and rabbits and vast microorganism farms--usually called yeast farms, though the yeast makes up a minority of the growths. And our wastes are mostly used right here at home to maintain all that growth. In fact, in many ways Trantor is very much like an enormous and overgrown space settlement. Have you ever visited one of those?\" \\n\\n \"Indeed I have.\" \\n\\n \"Space settlements are essentially enclosed cities, with everything artificially cycled, with artificial ventilation, artificial day and night, and so on. Trantor is different only in that even the largest space settlement has a population of only ten million and Trantor has four thousand times that. Of course, we have real gravity. And no space settlement can match us in our microfoods. We have yeast vats, fungal vats, and algae ponds vast beyond the imagination. And we are strong on artificial flavoring, added with no light hand. Thats what gives the taste to what youre eating.\" \\n\\n Seldon had gotten through most of his sandwich and found it not as offensive as the first bite had been. \"And it wont affect me?\" \\n\\n \"It does hit the intestinal flora and every once in a while it afflicts some poor Outworlder with diarrhea, but thats rare, and you harden even to that quickly. Still, drink your milkshake, which you probably wont like. It contains an antidiarrhetic that should keep you safe, even if you tend to be sensitive to such things.\" \\n\\n Seldon said querulously, \"Dont talk about it, Hummin. A person can be suggestible to such things.\" \\n\\n \"Finish the milkshake and forget the suggestibility.\" \\n\\n They finished the rest of their meal in silence and soon were on their way again. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46254.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
