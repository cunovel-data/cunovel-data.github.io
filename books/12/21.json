{"id":313,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"\n Seldon tried to look inconspicuous at the air-taxi rental terminus, which he found difficult. To look ostentatiously inconspicuous--to slink about, to turn his face away from all who passed, to study one of the vehicles overintently--was surely the way to invite attention. The way to behave was merely to assume an innocent normality. \n But what was normality? He felt uncomfortable in his clothes. There were no pockets, so he had no place to put his hands. The two pouches, which dangled from his belt on either side, distracted him by hitting against him as he moved, so that he was continually thinking someone had nudged him. He tried looking at women as they passed. They had no pouches, at least none dangling, but they carried little boxlike affairs that they occasionally clipped to one hip or another by some device he could not make out. It was probably pseudomagnetic, he decided. Their clothes were not particularly revealing, he noted regretfully, and not one had any sign of dÈñèolletage, although some dresses seemed to be designed to emphasize the buttocks. Meanwhile, Hummin had been very businesslike, having presented the necessary credits and returned with the superconductive ceramic tile that would activate a specific air-taxi. \n Hummin said, \"Get in, Seldon,\" gesturing to a small two-seated vehicle. \n Seldon asked, \"Did you have to sign your name, Hummin?\" \n \"Of course not. They know me here and dont stand on ceremony.\" \n \"What do they think youre doing?\" \n \"They didnt ask and I volunteered no information.\" He inserted the tile and Seldon felt a slight vibration as the air-taxi came to life. \"Were headed for D-7,\" said Hummin, making conversation. \n Seldon didnt know what D-7 was, but he assumed it meant some route or other. The air-taxi found its way past and around other ground-cars and finally moved onto a smooth upward-slanting track and gained speed. Then it lifted upward with a slight jolt. \n Seldon, who had been automatically strapped in by a webbed restraint, felt himself pushed down into his seat and then up against the webbing. He said, \"That didnt feel like antigravity.\" \n \"It wasnt,\" said Hummin. \"That was a small jet reaction. Just enough to take us up to the tubes.\" \n What appeared before them now looked like a cliff patterned with cave openings, much like a checkerboard. Hummin maneuvered toward the D-7 opening, avoiding other air-taxis that were heading for other tunnels. \n \"You could crash easily,\" said Seldon, clearing his throat. \n \"So I probably would if everything depended on my senses and reactions, but the taxi is computerized and the computer can overrule me without trouble. The same is true for the other taxis.--Here we go.\" \n They slid into D-7 as if they had been sucked in and the bright light of the open plaza outside mellowed, turning a warmer yellow hue. Hummin released the controls and sat back. He drew a deep breath and said, \"Well, thats one stage successfully carried through. We might have been stopped at the station. In here, were fairly safe.\" \n The ride was smooth and the walls of the tunnel slipped by rapidly. There was almost no sound, just a steady velvety whirr as the taxi sped along. \"How fast are we going?\" asked Seldon. \n Hummin cast an eye briefly at the controls. \"Three hundred and fifty kilometers per hour.\" \n \"Magnetic propulsion?\" \n \"Yes. You have it on Helicon, I imagine.\" \n \"Yes. One line. Ive never been on it myself, though Ive always meant to. I dont think its anything like this.\" \n \"Im sure it isnt. Trantor has many thousands of kilometers of these tunnels honeycombing the land subsurface and a number that snake under the shallower extensions of the ocean. Its the chief method of long-distance travel.\" \n \"How long will it take us?\" \n \"To reach our immediate destination? A little over five hours.\" \n \"Five hours!\" Seldon was dismayed. \n \"Dont be disturbed. We pass rest areas every twenty minutes or so where we can stop, pull out of the tunnel, stretch our feet, eat, or relieve ourselves. Id like to do that as few times as possible, of course.\" \n They continued on in silence for a while and then Seldon started when a blaze of light flared at their right for a few seconds and, in the flash, he thought he saw two air-taxis. \n \"That was a rest area,\" said Hummin in answer to the unspoken question. \n Seldon said, \"Am I really going to be safe wherever it is you are taking me?\" \n Hummin said, \"Quite safe from any open movement on the part of the Imperial forces. Of course, when it comes to the individual operator--the spy, the agent, the hired assassin--one must always be careful. Naturally, I will supply you with a bodyguard.\" \n Seldon felt uneasy. \"The hired assassin? Are you serious? Would they really want to kill me?\" \n Hummin said, \"Im sure Demerzel doesnt. I suspect he wants to use you rather than kill you. Still, other enemies may turn up or there may be unfortunate concatenations of events. You cant go through life sleepwalking.\" \n Seldon shook his head and turned his face away. To think, only forty-eight hours ago he had been just an insignificant, virtually unknown Outworld mathematician, content only to spend his remaining time on Trantor sight-seeing, gazing at the enormity of the great world with his provincial eye. And now, it was finally sinking in: He was a wanted man, hunted by Imperial forces. The enormity of the situation seized him and he shuddered. \n \"And what about you and what youre doing right now?\" \n Hummin said thoughtfully, \"Well, they wont feel kindly toward me, I suppose. I might have my head laid open or my chest exploded by some mysterious and never-found assailant.\" \n Hummin said it without a tremor in his voice or a change in his calm appearance, but Seldon winced. \n Seldon said, \"I rather thought you would assume that might be in store for you. You dont seem to be ... bothered by it.\" \n \"Im an old Trantorian. I know the planet as well as anybody can. I know many people and many of them are under obligation to me. I like to think that I am shrewd and not easy to outwit. In short, Seldon, I am quite confident that I can take care of myself.\" \n \"Im glad you feel that way and I hope youre justified in thinking so, Hummin, but I cant get it through my head why youre taking this chance at all. What am I to you? Why should you take even the smallest risk for someone who is a stranger to you?\" \n Hummin checked the controls in a preoccupied manner and then he faced Seldon squarely, eyes steady and serious. \n \"I want to save you for the same reason that the Emperor wants to use you--for your predictive powers.\" \n Seldon felt a deep pang of disappointment. This was not after all a question of being saved. He was merely the helpless and disputed prey of competing predators. He said angrily, \"I will never live down that presentation at the Decennial Convention. I have ruined my life.\" \n \"No. Dont rush to conclusions, mathematician. The Emperor and his officers want you for one reason only, to make their own lives more secure. They are interested in your abilities only so far as they might be used to save the Emperors rule, preserve that rule for his young son, maintain the positions, status, and power of his officials. I, on the other hand, want your powers for the good of the Galaxy.\" \n \"Is there a distinction?\" spat Seldon acidly. \n And Hummin replied with the stern beginning of a frown, \"If you do not see the distinction, then that is to your shame. The human occupants of the Galaxy existed before this Emperor who now rules, before the dynasty he represents, before the Empire itself. Humanity is far older than the Empire. It may even be far older than the twenty-five million worlds of the Galaxy. There are legends of a time when humanity inhabited a single world.\" \n \"Legends!\" said Seldon, shrugging his shoulders. \n \"Yes, legends, but I see no reason why that may not have been so in fact, twenty thousand years ago or more. I presume that humanity did not come into existence complete with knowledge of hyperspatial travel. Surely, there must have been a time when people could not travel at superluminal velocities and they must then have been imprisoned in a single planetary system. And if we look forward in time, the human beings of the worlds of the Galaxy will surely continue to exist after you and the Emperor are dead, after his whole line comes to an end, and after the institutions of the Empire itself unravel. In that case, it is not important to worry overmuch about individuals, about the Emperor and the young Prince Imperial. It is not important to worry even about the mechanics of Empire. What of the quadrillions of people that exist in the Galaxy? What of them?\" \n Seldon said, \"Worlds and people would continue, I presume.\" \n \"Dont you feel any serious need of probing the possible conditions under which they would continue to exist.\" \n \"One would assume they would exist much as they do now.\" \n \"One would assume. But could one know by this art of prediction that you speak of?\" \n \"Psychohistory is what I call it. In theory, one could.\" \n \"And you feel no pressure to turn that theory into practice.\" \n \"I would love to, Hummin, but the desire to do so doesnt automatically manufacture the ability to do so. I told the Emperor that psychohistory could not be turned into a practical technique and I am forced to tell you the same thing.\" \n \"And you have no intention of even trying to find the technique?\" \n \"No, I dont, any more than I would feel I ought to try to tackle a pile of pebbles the size of Trantor, count them one by one, and arrange them in order of decreasing mass. I would know it was not something I could accomplish in a lifetime and I would not be fool enough to make a pretense of trying.\" \n \"Would you try if you knew the truth about humanitys situation?\" \n \"Thats an impossible question. What is the truth about humanitys situation? Do you claim to know it?\" \n \"Yes, I do. And in five words.\" Hummins eyes faced forward again, turning briefly toward the blank changelessness of the tunnel as it pushed toward them, expanding until it passed and then dwindling as it slipped away. He then spoke those five words grimly. \n He said, \"The Galactic Empire is dying.\" \n University \n STREELING UNIVERSITY-- ... An institution of higher learning in the Streeling Sector of ancient Trantor ... Despite all these claims to fame in the fields of the humanities and sciences alike, it is not for those that the University looms large in todays consciousness. It would probably have come as a total surprise to the generations of scholars at the University to know that in later times Streeling University would be most remembered because a certain Hari Seldon, during the period of The Flight, had been in residence there for a short time. \n ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46250.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"Âü∫Âú∞Á≥ªÂàó Prelude to Foundation Âü∫Âú∞ÂâçÂ•è","description":"ÁÆÄ‰ªãÔºö ÊïÖ‰∫ãÂÄíÂõûÂìàÈáåË∞¢È°ø‰∫åÂçÅÂ§öÂ≤ÅÈ¶ñÊ¨°Ë∏èË∂≥Â∑ùÈôÄÂíåÂèëÂ±ïÂøÉÁêÜÂè≤Â≠¶ÁöÑÁªèËøá„ÄÇÊú¨‰π¶ÊòØ‰∏ÄÊú¨ÈïøÁØáÂ∞èËØ¥ÔºåÂÜÖÂàÜ19 Á´†Ôºå‰∏ªË¶ÅËÆ≤Ëø∞Ë∞¢È°øÂú®Â∑ùÈôÄÁöÑÂéÜÈô©ËøáÁ®ã„ÄÇÈòøË•øËé´Â§´ÂÜô‰ΩúÊú¨‰π¶ÁöÑÁõÆÁöÑÊòØ‰∏∫‰∫ÜË¶ÅÁªü‰∏ÄÂÖ∂Á¨î‰∏ã‰∏âÂ§ßÁ≥ªÂàóÂ∞èËØ¥Êú∫Âô®‰∫∫„ÄÅÈì∂Ê≤≥Â∏ùÂõΩÂíåÂü∫Âú∞„ÄÇÊú¨‰π¶Âá∫Áé∞‰∫ÜËâæÊ∞èÊúÄÂá∫ÂêçÁöÑÊú∫Âô®‰∫∫Â≠¶‰∏â(Âõõ)Â§ßÊ≥ïÂàôÂíåÊú∫Âô®‰∫∫Á≥ªÂàó...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"ÂèåËØ≠Â∞èËØ¥","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
