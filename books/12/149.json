Dahl might have complaints of their treatment by the Imperial rulers of Trantor, but surely there was nothing wrong with the weather the computers spun out for them. Dors said in a low voice, \"We seem to be celebrities. No mistake about that.\" Seldon brought his eyes down from the supposed sky and was immediately aware of a fair-sized crowd around the apartment house in which the Tisalvers lived. Everyone in the crowd stared at them intently. When it was clear that the two Outworlders had become aware of the attention, a low murmur ran through the crowd, which seemed to be on the point of breaking out into applause. Dors said, \"Now I can see where Mistress Tisalver would find this annoying. I should have been a little more sympathetic.\" The crowd was, for the most part, poorly dressed and it was not hard to guess that many of the people were from Billibotton. On impulse, Seldon smiled and raised one hand in a mild greeting that was met with applause. One voice, lost in the safe anonymity of the crowd called out, \"Can the lady show us some knife tricks?\" When Dors called back, \"No, I only draw in anger,\" there was instant laughter. One man stepped forward. He was clearly not from Billibotton and bore no obvious mark of being a Dahlite. He had only a small mustache, for one thing, and it was brown, not black. He said, \"Marlo Tanto of the Trantorian HV News. Can we have you in focus for a bit for our nightly holocast?\" \"No,\" said Dors shortly. \"No interviews.\" The newsman did not budge. \"I understand you were in a fight with a great many men in Billibotton--and won.\" He smiled. \"Thats news, that is.\" \"No,\" said Dors. \"We met some men in Billibotton, talked to them, and then moved on. Thats all there is to it and thats all youre going to get.\" \"Whats your name? You dont sound like a Trantorian.\" \"I have no name.\" \"And your friends name?\" \"He has no name.\" The newsman looked annoyed, \"Look, lady. Youre news and Im just trying to do my job.\" Raych pulled at Dorss sleeve. She leaned down and listened to his earnest whisper. She nodded and straightened up again. \"I dont think youre a newsman, Mr. Tanto. What I think you are is an Imperial agent trying to make trouble for Dahl. There was no fight and youre trying to manufacture news concerning one as a way of justifying an Imperial expedition into Billibotton. I wouldnt stay here if I were you. I dont think youre very popular with these people.\" The crowd had begun to mutter at Dorss first words. They grew louder now and began to drift, slowly and in a menacing way, in the direction of Tanto. He looked nervously around and began to move away. Dors raised her voice. \"Let him go. Dont anyone touch him. Dont give him any excuse to report violence.\" And they parted before him. Raych said, \"Aw, lady, you shoulda let them rough him up.\" \"Bloodthirsty boy,\" said Dors, \"take us to this friend of yours.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46460.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
