{"id":425,"no":133,"title":"Chapter 66","content":"When Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili were alone, Dors asked thoughtfully, \"Are you really planning to see this Mother woman?\" \"Im thinking about it, Dors.\" \"Youre an odd one, Hari. You seem to go steadily from bad to worse. You went Upperside, which seemed harmless enough, for a rational purpose when you were in Streeling. Then, in Mycogen, you broke into the Elders aerie, a much more dangerous task, for a much more foolish purpose. And now in Dahl, you want to go to this place, which that young man seems to think is simple suicide, for something altogether nonsensical.\" \"Im curious about this reference to Earth--and must know if theres anything to it.\" Dors said, \"Its a legend and not even an interesting one. It is routine. The names differ from planet to planet, but the content is the same. There is always the tale of an original world and a golden age. There is a longing for a supposedly simple and virtuous past that is almost universal among the people of a complex and vicious society. In one way or another, this is true of all societies, since everyone imagines his or her own society to be too complex and vicious, however simple it may be. Mark that down for your psychohistory.\" \"Just the same,\" said Seldon, \"I have to consider the possibility that one world did once exist. Aurora ... Earth ... the name doesnt matter. In fact--\" He paused and finally Dors said, \"Well?\" Seldon shook his head. \"Do you remember the hand-on-thigh story you told me in Mycogen? It was right after I got the Book from Raindrop Forty-Three ... Well, it popped into my head one evening recently when we were talking to the Tisalvers. I said something that reminded me, for an instant--\" \"Reminded you of what?\" \"I dont remember. It came into my head and went out again, but somehow every time I think of the single-world notion, it seems to me I have the tips of my fingers on something and then lose it.\" Dors looked at Seldon in surprise. \"I dont see what it could be. The hand-on-thigh story has nothing to do with Earth or Aurora.\" \"I know, but this ... thing ... that hovers just past the edge of my mind seems to be connected with this single world anyway and I have the feeling that I must find out more about it at any cost. That ... and robots.\" \"Robots too? I thought the Elders aerie put an end to that.\" \"Not at all. Ive been thinking about them.\" He stared at Dors with a troubled look on his face for a long moment, then said, \"But Im not sure.\" \"Sure about what, Hari?\" But Seldon merely shook his head and said nothing more. Dors frowned, then said, \"Hari, let me tell you one thing. In sober history--and, believe me, I know what Im talking about there is no mention of one world of origin. Its a popular belief, I admit. I dont mean just among the unsophisticated followers of folklore, like the Mycogenians and the Dahlite heatsinkers, but there are biologists who insist that there must have been one world of origin for reasons that are well outside my area of expertise and there are the more mystical historians who tend to speculate about it. And among the leisure-class intellectuals, I understand such speculations are becoming fashionable. Still, scholarly history knows nothing about it.\" Seldon said, \"All the more reason, perhaps, to go beyond scholarly history. All I want is a device that will simplify psychohistory for me and I dont care what the device is, whether it is a mathematical trick or a historical trick or something totally imaginary. If the young man weve just talked to had had a little more formal training, Id have set him on the problem. His thinking is marked by considerable ingenuity and originality--\" Dors said, \"And youre really going to help him, then?\" \"Absolutely. Just as soon as Im in a position to.\" \"But ought you to make promises youre not sure youll be able to keep?\" \"I want to keep it. If youre that stiff about impossible promises, consider that Hummin told Sunmaster Fourteen that Id use psychohistory to get the Mycogenians their world back. Theres just about zero chance of that. Even if I work out psychohistory, who knows if it can be used for so narrow and specialized a purpose? Theres a real case of promising what one cant deliver.\" But Dors said with some heat, \"Chetter Hummin was trying to save our lives, to keep us out of the hands of Demerzel and the Emperor. Dont forget that. And I think he really would like to help the Mycogenians.\" \"And I really would like to help Yugo Amaryl and I am far more likely to be able to help him than I am the Mycogenians, so if you justify the second, please dont criticize the first. Whats more, Dors\"--and his eyes flashed angrily--\"I really would like to find Mother Rittah and Im prepared to go alone.\"\"Never!\" snapped Dors. \"If you go, I go.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46444.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
