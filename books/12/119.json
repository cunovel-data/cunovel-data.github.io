{"id":411,"no":119,"title":"Chapter 59","content":"It was Dors who identified the newcomer first, perhaps because it was she who expected him. \"Hummin,\" she said, \"thank goodness you found us. I got in touch with you the moment I realized I was not going to deflect Hari from\"--she held up her hands in a wide gesture \"this.\" Hummins smile was a small one that did not alter the natural gravity of his face. There was a subtle weariness about him. \"My dear,\" he said, \"I was engaged in other things. I cannot always pull away at a moments notice. And when I got here, I had, like you two, to supply myself with a kirtle and sash, to say nothing of a skincap, and make my way out here. Had I been here earlier, I might have stopped this, but I believe Im not too late.\" Sunmaster Fourteen had recovered from what had seemed to be a painful shock. He said in a voice that lacked its customary severe depth, \"How did you get in here, Tribesman Hummin?\" \"It was not easy, High Elder, but as Tribeswoman Venabili likes to say, I am a very persuasive person. Some of the citizens here remember who I was and what I have done for Mycogen in the past, that I am even an honorary Brother. Have you forgotten, Sunmaster Fourteen?\" The Elder replied, \"I have not forgotten, but even the most favorable memory can not survive certain actions. A tribesman here and a tribeswoman. There is no greater crime. All you have done is not great enough to balance that. My people are not unmindful. We will make it up to you some other way. But these two must die or be handed over to the Emperor.\" \"I am also here,\" said Hummin calmly. \"Is that not a crime as well?\" \"For you,\" said Sunmaster Fourteen, \"for you personally, as a kind of honorary Brother, I can ... overlook it ... once. Not these two.\" \"Because you expect a reward from the Emperor? Some favor? Some concession? Have you already been in touch with him or with his Chief of Staff, Eto Demerzel, more likely?\" \"That is not a subject for discussion.\" \"Which is itself an admission. Come on, I dont ask what the Emperor promised, but it cannot be much. He does not have much to give in these degenerate days. Let me make you an offer. Have these two told you they are scholars?\" \"They have.\" \"And they are. They are not lying. The tribeswoman is a historian and the tribesman is a mathematician. The two together are trying to combine their talents to make a mathematics of history and they call the combined subject psychohistory. \" Sunmaster Fourteen said, \"I know nothing about this psychohistory, nor do I care to know. Neither it nor any other facet of your tribal learning interests me.\" \"Nevertheless,\" said Hummin, \"I suggest that you listen to me.\" It took Hummin some fifteen minutes, speaking concisely, to describe the possibility of organizing the natural laws of society (something he always mentioned with audible quotation marks in the tone of his voice) in such a way as to make it possible to anticipate the future with a substantial degree of probability. And when he was done, Sunmaster Fourteen, who had listened expressionlessly, said, \"A highly unlikely piece of speculation, I should say.\" Seldon, with a rueful expression, seemed about to speak, undoubtedly to agree, but Hummins hand, resting lightly on the others knee, tightened unmistakably. Hummin said, \"Possibly, High Elder, but the Emperor doesnt think so. And by the Emperor, who is himself an amiable enough personage, I really mean Demerzel, concerning whose ambitions you need no instruction. They would like very much to have these two scholars, which is why Ive brought them here for safekeeping. I had little expectation that you would do Demerzels work for him by delivering the scholars to him.\" \"They have committed a crime that--\" \"Yes, we know, High Elder, but it is only a crime because you choose to call it so. No real harm has been done.\" \"It has been done to our belief, to our deepest felt--\" \"But imagine what harm will be done if psychohistory falls into the hands of Demerzel. Yes, I grant that nothing may come of it, but suppose for a moment that something does and that the Imperial government has the use of it--can foretell what is to come--can take measures with that foreknowledge which no one else would have--can take measures, in fact, designed to bring about an alternate future more to the Imperial liking.\" \"Well?\" \"Is there any doubt, High Elder, that the alternate future more to the Imperial liking would be one of tightened centralization? For centuries now, as you very well know, the Empire has been undergoing a steady decentralization. Many worlds now acknowledge only lip service to the Emperor and virtually rule themselves. Even here on Trantor, there is decentralization. Mycogen, as only one example, is free of Imperial interference for the most part. You rule its High Elder and there is no Imperial officer at your side overseeing your actions and decisions. How long do you think that will last with men like Demerzel adjusting the future to their liking?\" \"Still the flimsiest of speculation,\" said Sunmaster Fourteen, \"but a disturbing one, I admit.\" \"On the other hand, if these scholars can complete their task, an unlikely if, you might say, but an if--then they are sure to remember that you spared them when you might have chosen not to. And it would then be conceivable that they would learn to arrange a future, for instance, that would allow Mycogen to be given a world of its own, a world that could be terraformed into a close replica of the Lost World. And even if these two forget your kindness, I will be here to remind them.\" \"Well--\" said Sunmaster Fourteen. \"Come on,\" said Hummin, \"it is not hard to decide what must be going through your mind. Of all tribespeople, you must trust Demerzel the least. And though the chance of psychohistory might be small (if I was not being honest with you, I would not admit that) it is not zero; and if it will bring about a restoration of the Lost World, what can you want more than that? What would you not risk for even a tiny chance of that? Come now--I promise you and my promises are not lightly given. Release these two and choose a tiny chance of your hearts desire over no chance at all.\" There was silence and then Sunmaster Fourteen sighed. \"I dont know how it is, Tribesman Hummin, but on every occasion that we meet, you persuade me into something I do not really want to do.\" \"Have I ever misled you, High Elder?\" \"You have never offered me so small a chance?\" \"And so high a possible reward. The one balances the other.\" And Sunmaster Fourteen nodded his head. \"You are right. Take these two and take them out of Mycogen and never let me see them again unless there comes a time when--But surely it will not be in my lifetime.\" \"Perhaps not, High Elder. But your people have been waiting patiently for nearly twenty thousand years. Would you then object to waiting another--perhaps--two hundred?\" \"I would not willingly wait one moment, but my people will wait as long as they must.\" And standing up, he said, \"I will clear the path. Take them and go.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46430.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
