She said nothing at all to either Seldon or Dors, but gave a curt nod of her head when they greeted her and gazed sharply about the room as though to verify that the heatsinker had left no trace. She then sniffed the air sharply and looked at Seldon accusingly before marching through the common room into the family bedroom. \n Tisalver himself arrived home later and when Seldon and Dors came to the dinner table, Tisalver took advantage of the fact that his wife was still ordering some last-minute details in connection with the dinner to say in a low voice, \"Has that person been here?\" \n \"And gone,\" said Seldon solemnly. \"Your wife was out at the time.\" \n Tisalver nodded and said, \"Will you have to do this again?\" \n \"I dont think so,\" said Seldon. \n \"Good.\" \n Dinner passed largely in silence, but afterward, when the daughter had gone to her room for the dubious pleasures of computer practice, Seldon leaned back and said, \"Tell me about Billibotton.\" \n Tisalver looked astonished and his mouth moved without any sound issuing. \n Casilia, however, was less easily rendered speechless. She said, \"Is that where your new friend lives? Are you going to return the visit?\" \n \"So far,\" said Seldon quietly, \"I have just asked about Billibotton.\" \n Casilia said sharply, \"It is a slum. The dregs live there. No one goes there, except the filth that make their homes there.\" \n \"I understand a Mother Rittah lives there.\" \n \"I never heard of her,\" said Casilia, her mouth closing with a snap. It was quite clear that she had no intention of knowing anyone by name who lived in Billibotton. \n Tisalver, casting an uneasy look at his wife, said, \"Ive heard of her. Shes a crazy old woman who is supposed to tell fortunes.\" \n \"And does she live in Billibotton?\" \n \"I dont know, Master Seldon. Ive never seen her. Shes mentioned sometimes in the news holocasts when she makes her predictions.\" \n \"Do they come true?\" \n Tisalver snorted. \"Do predictions ever come true? Hers dont even make sense.\" \n \"Does she ever talk about Earth?\" \n \"I dont know. I wouldnt be surprised.\" \n \"The mention of Earth doesnt puzzle you. Do you know about Earth?\" \n Now Tisalver looked surprised. \"Certainly, Master Seldon. Its the world all people came from ... supposedly.\" \n \"Supposedly? Dont you believe it?\" \n \"Me? Im educated. But many ignorant people believe it.\" \n \"Are there book-films about Earth?\" \n \"Childrens stories sometimes mention Earth. I remember, when I was a young boy, my favorite story began, Once, long ago, on Earth, when Earth was the only planet-- Remember, Casilia? You liked it too.\" \n Casilia shrugged, unwilling to bend as yet. \n \"Id like to see it sometime,\" said Seldon, \"but I mean real book-films ... uh ... learned ones ... or films ... or printouts.\" \n \"I never heard of any, but the library--\" \n \"Ill try that.--Are there any taboos about speaking of Earth?\" \n \"What are taboos?\" \n \"I mean, is it a strong custom that people mustnt talk of Earth or that outsiders mustnt ask about it?\" \n Tisalver looked so honestly astonished that there seemed no point in waiting for an answer. \n Dors put in, \"Is there some rule about outsiders not going to Billibotton?\" \n Now Tisalver turned earnest. \"No rule, but its not a good idea for anyone to go there. I wouldnt.\" \n Dors said, \"Why not?\" \n \"Its dangerous. Violent! Everyone is armed.--I mean, Dahl is an armed place anyway, but in Billibotton they use the weapons. Stay in this neighborhood. Its safe.\" \n \"So far,\" said Casilia darkly. \"It would be better if we left altogether. Heatsinkers go anywhere these days.\" And there was another lowering look in Seldons direction. \n Seldon said, \"What do you mean that Dahl is an armed place? There are strong Imperial regulations against weapons.\" \n \"I know that,\" said Tisalver, \"and there are no stun guns here or percussives or Psychic Probes or anything like that. But there are knives.\" He looked embarrassed. \n Dors said, \"Do you carry a knife, Tisalver?\" \n \"Me?\" He looked genuinely horrified. \"I am a man of peace and this is a safe neighborhood.\" \n \"We have a couple of them in the house,\" said Casilia, sniffing again. \"Were not that certain this is a safe neighborhood.\" \n \"Does everyone carry knives?\" asked Dors. \n \"Almost everyone, Mistress Venabili,\" said Tisalver. \"Its customary. But that doesnt mean everyone uses them.\" \n \"But they use them in Billibotton, I suppose,\" said Dors. \n \"Sometimes. When theyre excited, they have fights.\" \n \"And the government permits it? The Imperial government, I mean?\" \n \"Sometimes they try to clean Billibotton up, but knives are too easy to hide and the custom is too strong. Besides, its almost always Dahlites that get killed and I dont think the Imperial government gets too upset over that.\" \n \"What if its an outsider who gets killed?\" \n \"If its reported, the Imperials could get excited. But what happens is that no one has seen anything and no one knows anything. The Imperials sometimes round up people on general principles, but they can never prove anything. I suppose they decide its the outsiders fault for being there.--So dont go to Billibotton, even if you have a knife.\" \n Seldon shook his head rather pettishly. \"I wouldnt carry a knife. I dont know how to use one. Not skillfully.\" \n \"Then its simple, Master Seldon. Stay out.\" Tisalver shook his head portentously. \"Just stay out.\" \n \"I may not be able to do that either,\" said Seldon. \n Dors glared at him, clearly annoyed, and said to Tisalver, \"Where does one buy a knife? Or may we have one of yours?\" \n Casilia said quickly, \"No one takes someone elses knife. You must buy your own.\" \n Tisalver said, \"There are knife stores all over. There arent supposed to be. Theoretically theyre illegal, you know. Any appliance store sells them, however. If you see a washing machine on display, thats a sure sign.\" \n \"And how does one get to Billibotton?\" asked Seldon. \n \"By Expressway.\" \n Tisalver looked dubious as he looked at Dorss frowning expression. \n Seldon said, \"And once I reach the Expressway?\" \n \"Get on the eastbound side and watch for the signs. But if you must go, Master Seldon\"--Tisalver hesitated, then said--\"you mustnt take Mistress Venabili. Women sometimes are treated ... worse.\" \n \"She wont go,\" said Seldon. \n \"Im afraid she will,\" said Dors with quiet determination. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46446.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
