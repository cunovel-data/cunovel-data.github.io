{"id":309,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Hari Seldon looked at the holograph of himself cast by Hummins projector. It was more dramatic and useful than a mirror would have been. In fact, it seemed as though there were two of him in the room. Seldon studied the sleeve of his new tunic. His Heliconian attitudes made him wish the colors were less vibrant, but he was thankful that, as it was, Hummin had chosen softer colors than were customary here on this world. (Seldon thought of the clothing worn by their two assailants and shuddered inwardly.) He said, \"And I suppose I must wear this hat.\" \"In the Imperial Sector, yes. To go bareheaded here is a sign of low breeding. Elsewhere, the rules are different.\" Seldon sighed. The round hat was made of soft material and molded itself to his head when he put it on. The brim was evenly wide all around, but it was narrower than on the hats his attackers had worn. Seldon consoled himself by noticing that when he wore the hat the brim curved rather gracefully. \"It doesnt have a strap under the chin.\" \"Of course not. Thats advanced fashion for young lanks.\" \"For young what?\" \"A lank is someone who wears things for their shock value. Im sure you have such people on Helicon.\" Seldon snorted. \"There are those who wear their hair shoulder-length on one side and shave the other.\" He laughed at the memory. Hummins mouth twisted slightly. \"I imagine it looks uncommonly ugly.\" \"Worse. There are lefties and righties, apparently, and each finds the other version highly offensive. The two groups often engage in street brawls.\" \"Then I think you can stand the hat, especially without the strap.\" Seldon said, \"Ill get used to it.\" \"It will attract some attention. Its subdued for one thing and makes you look as if youre in mourning. And it doesnt quite fit. Then, too, you wear it with obvious discomfort. However, we wont be in the Imperial Sector long.--Seen enough?\" And the holograph flickered out. Seldon said, \"How much did this cost you?\" \"Whats the difference?\" \"It bothers me to be in your debt.\" \"Dont worry about it. This is my choice. But weve been here long enough. I will have been described, Im quite certain. Theyll track me down and theyll come here.\" \"In that case,\" said Seldon, \"the credits youre spending are a minor matter. Youre putting yourself into personal danger on my account. Personal danger!\" \"I know that. But its my free choice and I can take care of myself.\" \"But why--\" \"Well discuss the philosophy of it later.--Ive atomized your clothes, by the way, and I dont think I was seen. There was an energy surge, of course, and that would be recorded. Someone might guess what happened from that--its hard to obscure any action when probing eyes and mind are sharp enough. However, let us hope well be safely away before they put it all together.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46246.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
