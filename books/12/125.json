{"id":417,"no":125,"title":"Chapter 62","content":"\\n\\n Jirad Tisalver of the Dahl Sector was short. The top of his head came up only to Hari Seldons nose. He did not seem to take that to heart, however. He had handsome, even features, was given to smiling, and sported a thick black mustache and crisply curling black hair. \\n\\n He lived, with his wife and a half-grown daughter, in an apartment of seven small rooms, kept meticulously clean, but almost bare of furnishings. Tisalver said, \"I apologize, Master Seldon and Mistress Venabili, that I cannot give you the luxury to which you must be accustomed, but Dahl is a poor sector and I am not even among the better-off among our people.\" \\n\\n \"The more reason,\" responded Seldon, \"that we must apologize to you for placing the burden of our presence upon you.\" \\n\\n \"No burden, Master Seldon. Master Hummin has arranged to pay us generously for your use of our humble quarters and the credits would be welcome even if you were not--and you are.\" \\n\\n Seldon remembered Hummins parting words when they finally arrived in Dahl. \"Seldon\" he had said, \"this is the third place Ive arranged as sanctuary. The first two were notoriously beyond the reach of the Imperium, which might well have served to attract their attention; after all, they were logical places for you. This one is different. It is poor, unremarkable, and, as a matter of fact, unsafe in some ways. It is not a natural refuge for you, so that the Emperor and his Chief of Staff may not think to turn their eyes in this direction. Would you mind staying out of trouble this time, then?\" \\n\\n \"I will try, Hummin,\" said Seldon, a little offended. \"Please be aware that the trouble is not of my seeking. I am trying to learn what may well take me thirty lifetimes to learn if I am to have the slightest chance of organizing psychohistory.\" \\n\\n \"I understand,\" said Hummin. \"Your efforts at learning brought you to Upperside in Streeling and to the Elders aerie in Mycogen and to who can guess where in Dahl. As for you, Dr. Venabili, I know youve been trying to take care of Seldon, but you must try harder. Get it fixed in your head that he is the most important person on Trantor--or in the Galaxy, for that matter--and that he must be kept secure at any cost.\" \\n\\n \"I will continue to do my best,\" said Dors stiffly. \"And as for your host family, they have their peculiarities, but they are essentially good people with whom I have dealt before. Try not to get them in trouble either.\" \\n\\n But Tisalver, at least, did not seem to anticipate trouble of any kind from his new tenants and his expressed pleasure at the company he now had--quite apart from the rent credits he would be getting--seemed quite sincere. He had never been outside Dahl and his appetite for tales of distant places was enormous. His wife too, bowing and smiling, would listen and their daughter, with a finger in her mouth, would allow one eye to peep from behind the door. It was usually after dinner, when the entire family assembled, that Seldon and Dors were expected to talk of the outside world. The food was plentiful enough, but it was bland and often tough. So soon after the tangy food of Mycogen, it was all but inedible. \\n\\n The \"table\" was a long shelf against one wall and they ate standing up. Gentle questioning by Seldon elicited the fact that this was the usual situation among Dahlites as a whole and was not due to unusual poverty. Of course, Mistress Tisalver explained, there were those with high government jobs in Dahl who were prone to adopt all kinds of effete customs like chairs--she called them \"body shelves\"--but this was looked down upon by the solid middle class. Much as they disapproved of unnecessary luxury, though, the Tisalvers loved hearing about it, listening with a virtual storm of tongue-clicking when told of mattresses lifted on legs, of ornate chests and wardrobes, and of a superfluity of tableware. \\n\\n They listened also to a description of Mycogenian customs, while Jirad Tisalver stroked his own hair complacently and made it quite obvious that he would as soon think of emasculation as of depilation. Mistress Tisalver was furious at any mention of female subservience and flatly refused to believe that the Sisters accepted it tranquilly. \\n\\n They seized most, however, on Seldons. casual reference to the Imperial grounds. When, upon questioning, it turned out that Seldon had actually seen and spoken to the Emperor, a blanket of awe enveloped the family. It took a while before they dared ask questions and Seldon found that he could not satisfy them. He had not, after all, seen much of the grounds and even less of the Palace interior. \\n\\n That disappointed the Tisalvers and they were unremitting in their attempts to elicit more. And, having heard of Seldons Imperial adventure, they found it hard to believe Dorss assertion that, for her part, she had never been anywhere in the Imperial grounds. Most of all, they rejected Seldons casual comment that the Emperor had talked and behaved very much as any ordinary human being would. That seemed utterly impossible to the Tisalvers. After three evenings of this, Seldon found himself tiring. He had, at first, welcomed the chance to do nothing for a while (during the day, at least) but view some of the history book-films that Dors recommended. The Tisalvers turned over their book-viewer to their guests during the day with good grace, though the little girl seemed unhappy and was sent over to a neighbors apartment to use theirs for her homework. \\n\\n \"It doesnt help,\" Seldon said restlessly in the security of his room after he had piped in some music to discourage eavesdropping. \"I can see your fascination with history, but its all endless detail. Its a mountainous heap--no, a Galactic heap--of data in which I cant see the basic organization.\" \\n\\n \"I dare say,\" said Dors, \"that there must have been a time when human beings saw no organization in the stars in the sky, but eventually they discovered the Galactic structure.\" \\n\\n \"And Im sure that took generations, not weeks. There must have been a time when physics seemed a mass of unrelated observations before the central natural laws were discovered and that took generations.--And what of the Tisalvers?\" \\n\\n \"What of them? I think theyre being very nice.\" \\n\\n \"Theyre curious.\" \\n\\n \"Of course they are. Wouldnt you be if you were in their place?\" \\n\\n \"But is it just curiosity? They seem to be ferociously interested in my meeting with the Emperor.\" \\n\\n Dors seemed impatient. \"Again ... its only natural. Wouldnt you be--if the situation was reversed?\" \\n\\n \"It makes me nervous.\" \\n\\n \"Hummin brought us here.\" \\n\\n \"Yes, but hes not perfect. He brought me to the University and I was maneuvered Upperside. He brought us to Sunmaster Fourteen, who entrapped us. You know he did. Twice bitten, at least once shy. Im tired of being questioned.\" \\n\\n \"Then turn the tables, Hari. Arent you interested in Dahl?\" \\n\\n \"Of course. What do you know about it to begin with?\" \\n\\n \"Nothing. Its just one of more than eight hundred sectors and Ive only been on Trantor a little over two years.\" \\n\\n \"Exactly. And there are twenty-five million other worlds and Ive been on this problem only a little over two months.--I tell you. I want to go back to Helicon and take up a study of the mathematics of turbulence, which was my Ph.D. problem, and forget I ever saw--or thought I saw--that turbulence gave an insight into human society.\" \\n\\n But that evening he said to Tisalver, \"But you know, Master Tisalver, youve never told me what you do, the nature of your work.\" \\n\\n \"Me?\" Tisalver placed his fingers on his chest, which was covered by the simple white T-shirt with nothing underneath, which seemed to be the standard male uniform in Dahl. \"Nothing much. I work at the local holovision station in programming. Its very dull, but its a living.\" \\n\\n \"And its respectable,\" said Mistress Tisalver. \"It means he doesnt have to work in the heatsinks.\" \\n\\n \"The heatsinks?\" said Dors, lifting her light eyebrows and managing to look fascinated. \\n\\n \"Oh well,\" said Tisalver, \"thats what Dahl is best known for. It isnt much, but forty billion people on Trantor need energy and we supply a lot of it. We dont get appreciated, but Id like to see some of the fancy sectors do without it.\" \\n\\n Seldon looked confused. \"Doesnt Trantor get its energy from solar power stations in orbit?\" \\n\\n \"Some,\" said Tisalver, \"and some from nuclear fusion stations out on the islands and some from microfusion motors and some from wind stations Upperside, but half\"--he raised a finger in emphasis and his face looked unusually grave--\"half comes from the heatsinks. There are heatsinks in lots of places, but none--none--as rich as those in Dahl. Are you serious that you dont know about the heatsinks? You sit there and stare at me.\" \\n\\n Dors said quickly, \"We are Outworlders, you know.\" (She had almost said tribespeople, but had caught herself in time.) \"Especially Dr. Seldon. Hes only been on Trantor a couple of months.\" \\n\\n \"Really?\" said Mistress Tisalver. She was a trifle shorter than her husband, was plump without quite being fat, had her dark hair drawn tightly back into a bun, and possessed rather beautiful dark eyes. Like her husband, she appeared to be in her thirties. \\n\\n (After a period in Mycogen, not actually long in duration but intense, it struck Dors as odd to have a woman enter the conversation at will. How quickly modes and manners establish themselves, she thought, and made a mental note to mention that to Seldon--one more item for his psychohistory.) \"Oh yes,\" she said. \"Dr. Seldon is from Helicon.\" \\n\\n Mistress Tisalver registered polite ignorance. \"And where might that be?\" \\n\\n Dors said, \"Why, its--\" She turned to Seldon. \"Where is it, Hari?\" Seldon looked abashed. \"To tell you the truth, I dont think I could locate it very easily on a Galactic model without looking up the coordinates. All I can say is that its on the other side of the central black hole from Trantor and getting there by hypership is rather a chore.\" \\n\\n Mistress Tisalver said, \"I dont think Jirad and I will ever be on a hypership.\" \\n\\n \"Someday, Casilia,\" said Tisalver cheerfully, \"maybe we will. But tell us about Helicon, Master Seldon.\" \\n\\n Seldon shook his head. \"To me that would be dull. Its just a world, like any other. Only Trantor is different from all the rest. There are no heatsinks on Helicon--or probably anywhere else--except Trantor. Tell me about them.\" \\n\\n (\"Only Trantor is different from all the rest.\" The sentence repeated itself in Seldons mind and for a moment he grasped at it, and for some reason Dorss hand-on-thigh story suddenly recurred to him, but Tisalver was speaking and it passed out of Seldons mind as quickly as it had entered.) \\n\\n Tisalver said, \"If you really want to know about heatsinks, I can show you.\" He turned to his wife. \"Casilia, would you mind if tomorrow evening I take Master Seldon to the heatsinks.\" \\n\\n \"And me,\" said Dors quickly. \\n\\n \"And Mistress Venabili?\" \\n\\n Mistress Tisalver frowned and said sharply, \"I dont think it would be a good idea. Our visitors would find it dull.\" \\n\\n \"I dont think so, Mistress Tisalver,\" said Seldon ingratiatingly. \"We would very much like to see the heatsinks. We would be delighted if you would join us too ... and your little daughter--if she wants to come.\" \\n\\n \"To the heatsinks?\" said Mistress Tisalver, stiffening. \"Its no place at all for a decent woman.\" \\n\\n Seldon felt embarrassed at his gaffe. \"I meant no harm, Mistress Tisalver.\" \\n\\n \"No offense,\" said Tisalver. \"Casilia thinks its beneath us and so it is, but as long as I dont work there, its no distress merely to visit and show it to guests. But it is uncomfortable and I would never get Casilia to dress properly.\" \\n\\n They got up from their crouching positions. Dahlite \"chairs\" were merely molded plastic seats on small wheels and they cramped Seldons knees terribly and seemed to wiggle at his least body movement. The Tisalvers, however, had mastered the art of sitting firmly and rose without trouble and without needing to use their arms for help as Seldon had to. Dors also got up without trouble and Seldon once again marveled at her natural grace. \\n\\n Before they parted to their separate rooms for the night, Seldon said to Dors, \"Are you sure you know nothing about heatsinks? Mistress Tisalver makes them seem unpleasant.\" \\n\\n \"They cant be that unpleasant or Tisalver wouldnt suggest taking us on tour. Lets be content to be surprised.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46436.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
