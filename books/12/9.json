He said, \"Sire, you have almost lost your temper.\" \\n\\n Cleon looked up and, with an obvious effort, managed to smile. \"Well, so I did. The man was very disappointing.\" \\n\\n \"And yet he promised no more than he offered.\" \\n\\n \"He offered nothing.\" \\n\\n \"And promised nothing, Sire.\" \\n\\n \"It was disappointing.\" \\n\\n Demerzel said, \"More than disappointing, perhaps. The man is a loose cannon, Sire.\" \\n\\n \"A loose what, Demerzel? You are always so full of strange expressions. What is a cannon?\" \\n\\n Demerzel said gravely, \"It is simply an expression I heard in my youth, Sire. The Empire is full of strange expressions and some are unknown on Trantor, as those of Trantor are sometimes unknown elsewhere.\" \\n\\n \"Do you come to teach me the Empire is large? What do you mean by saying that the man is a loose cannon?\" \\n\\n \"Only that he can do much harm without necessarily intending it. He does not know his own strength. Or importance.\" \\n\\n \"You deduce that, do you, Demerzel?\" \\n\\n \"Yes, Sire. He is a provincial. He does not know Trantor or its ways. He has never been on our planet before and he cannot behave like a man of breeding, like a courtier. Yet he stood up to--\" \\n\\n \"And why not? I gave him permission to speak. I left off ceremony. I treated him as an equal.\" \\n\\n \"Not entirely, Sire. You dont have it within you to treat others as equals. You have the habit of command. And even if you tried to put a person at his ease, there would be few who could manage it. Most would be speechless or, worse, subservient and sycophantic. This man stood up to you.\" \\n\\n \"Well, you may admire that, Demerzel, but I didnt like him.\" Cleon looked thoughtfully discontented. \"Did you notice that he made no effort to explain his mathematics to me? It was as though he knew I would not understand a word of it.\" \\n\\n \"Nor would you have, Sire. You are not a mathematician, nor a scientist of any kind, nor an artist. There are many fields of knowledge in which others know more than you. It is their task to use their knowledge to serve you. You are the Emperor, which is worth all their specializations put together.\" \\n\\n \"Is it? I would not mind being made to feel ignorant by an old man who had accumulated knowledge over many years. But this man, Seldon, is just my age. How does he know so much?\" \\n\\n \"He has not had to learn the habit of command, the art of reaching a decision that will affect the lives of others.\" \\n\\n \"Sometimes, Demerzel, I wonder if you are laughing at me.\" \\n\\n \"Sire?\" said Demerzel reproachfully. \\n\\n \"But never mind. Back to that loose cannon of yours. Why should you consider him dangerous? He seems a naive provincial to me.\" \\n\\n \"He is. But he has this mathematical development of his.\" \\n\\n \"He says it is useless.\" \\n\\n \"You thought it might be useful. I thought so, after you had explained it to me. Others might. The mathematician may come to think so himself, now that his mind has been focused on it. And who knows, he may yet work out some way of making use of it. If he does, then to foretell the future, however mistily, is to be in a position of great power. Even if he does not wish power for himself, a kind of self-denial that always seems to me to be unlikely, he might be used by others.\" \\n\\n \"I tried to use him. He would not.\" \\n\\n \"He had not given it thought. Perhaps now he will. And if he was not interested in being used by you, might he not be persuaded by--let us say--the Mayor of Wye?\" \\n\\n \"Why should he be willing to help Wye and not us?\" \\n\\n \"As he explained, it is hard to predict the emotions and behavior of individuals.\" \\n\\n Cleon scowled and sat in thought. \"Do you really think he might develop this psychohistory of his to the point where it is truly useful? He is so certain he cannot.\" \\n\\n \"He may, with time, decide he was wrong in denying the possibility.\" \\n\\n Cleon said, \"Then I suppose I ought to have kept him.\" \\n\\n Demerzel said, \"No, Sire. Your instinct was correct when you let him go. Imprisonment, however disguised, would cause resentment and despair, which would not help him either to develop his ideas further or make him eager to help us. Better to let him go as you have done, but to keep him forever on an invisible leash. In this way, we can see that he is not used by an enemy of yourself, Sire, and we can see that when the time comes and he has fully developed his science, we can pull on our leash and bring him in. Then we could be ... more persuasive.\" \\n\\n \"But what if he it picked up by an enemy of mine or, better, of the Empire, for I am the Empire after all, or if, of his own accord, he wishes to serve an enemy--I dont consider that out of the question, you see.\" \\n\\n \"Nor should you. I will see to it that this doesnt happen, but if, against all striving, it does happen, it would be better if no one has him than if the wrong person does.\" \\n\\n Cleon looked uneasy. \"Ill leave that all in your hands, Demerzel, but I hope were not too hasty. He could be, after all, nothing but the purveyor of a theoretical science that does not and cannot work.\" \\n\\n \"Quite possibly, Sire, but it would be safer to assume the man is--or might be--important. We lose only a little time and nothing more if we find that we have concerned ourselves with a nonentity. We may lose a Galaxy if we find we have ignored someone of great importance.\" \\n\\n \"Very well, then,\" said Cleon, \"but I trust I wont have to know the details--if they prove unpleasant.\" \\n\\n Demerzel said, \"Let us hope that will not be the case.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46238.html","bookId":12,"book":{"id":12,"title":"基地系列 Prelude to Foundation 基地前奏","description":"简介： 故事倒回哈里谢顿二十多岁首次踏足川陀和发展心理史学的经过。本书是一本长篇小说，内分19 章，主要讲述谢顿在川陀的历险过程。阿西莫夫写作本书的目的是为了要统一其笔下三大系列小说机器人、银河帝国和基地。本书出现了艾氏最出名的机器人学三(四)大法则和机器人系列...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/18/15-03-30-81-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:22:58 AM"}}
