{"id":84203,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"The driver competing against Isaiah spins his tires at the waterline, creating a haze of white smoke. Because the Camaro has slicks, will it have an advantage? Isaiah bet everything he had against this guy: fifty dollars. If we don’t win, we go home. “I haven’t seen you race,” I say to Zach when I think of something coherent. “The Cobra sounded funny so I’m sitting her out.” I nod to let him know that I heard him, but keep my eyes on Isaiah. Please, please, please God, take care of Isaiah. “That’s your car, isn’t it?” he asks. “Yes.” I wish he’d be silent. If he talks then I can’t concentrate, and if I can’t concentrate then God will stop listening to my prayers. “Why aren’t you driving?” he asks. Isaiah’s competition hits the second staging line. The yellow lights flash down and right; as the light turns green, my car lurches with a power I never believed possible, lifting the front wheels. Isaiah rushes forward, with the Camaro following less than a second behind. Both cars fly by me, with Isaiah easily in the lead. Come on, come on, come on... Yes! Isaiah crosses the finish line first. I lower my head and suck in a breath. Thank You, God, for keeping him safe. “Did you hear me?” asks Zach. “Um...” This is awkward. “No. Sorry.” “I said that I want to race against you.” The red lights of my car glow in the distance as Isaiah leaves the track. My body automatically angles toward the exit, as if a gravitational pull exists between Isaiah and me. “I’ll tell Isaiah.” “No, Rachel.” Zach places a hand on my arm and his unwanted touch feels foreign against my skin. “I want to race you when you drive your car.” I move my arm, pretending to itch my shoulder. “I won’t be racing.” “Why?” “Because...” I don’t know how to explain in a way that doesn’t make me appear weak. “Because Isaiah’s one of those guys that doesn’t think that a girl should be behind a wheel.” I huff. “No, he’s not.” “I’ve got money.” Zach smirks. “And I hear he needs it. Tell him I’ll race, but only against you. He knows my stakes.” Something deep inside of me shifts, and it’s not the good type of stirring. “And Rachel?” Zach begins to slowly walk backward. “If you were my girl, I’d let you race.” “He’s not like that,” I say, but Zach already turned his back to me and is too far away to hear. “He’s not,” I repeat. At least I don’t think he is. Isaiah permitted Logan to drive his car without seeing how he would do behind the wheel. Yes, I messed up once, but why hasn’t Isaiah granted me another chance? Maybe because he’s discovered my secret. Maybe he already knows that I’m weak. Chapter 41 Isaiah HITTING EIGHTY-NINE, I SHIFT DOWN and slam my hand onto the steering wheel. “That’s what I’m fucking talking about!” The surge of adrenaline rushing through my veins makes me feel like I’m flying high without the loss of control that drugs or alcohol brings. This is the only time I feel truly alive. I turn left at the end of the drag strip and pause for my competition to catch up: a Nova with sweet upgrades. This is my last race for the night and damn, I feel good. My competition, a guy ten years older than me, shakes his head as he gets out of the car with a hundred in his hand. “I should have smoked you, kid. What’s under my hood is ten times what you’ve got.” He’s right. His upgrades should have kicked my ass. I take the money and resist the urge to kiss it. “Good race, man.” “Your reaction time at the light is insane,” he says. “I want a rematch Friday night.” My luck must be changing. “Bring cash and I’ll race you all night.” We share a short nod, and I drive Rachel’s car to where Logan and Rachel wait for me. I’ve won every race tonight. After getting his feet wet, Logan won more than he lost, bringing money to the table. In the darkness, Rachel shines as bright as the sun. Her hair a halo framing her face, her eyes stars. “That was awesome!” In two easy strides, I reach her, weave my arms around her waist and lift her feet off the ground. My angel is so light she practically floats. “Isaiah! You’re crazy!” “Insane,” I answer. She rests her forehead against mine and braids her hands tightly on my neck. “That was close. He almost got you in the end.” I love the sensation of her body against mine. Tonight, I’m going to kiss her again and, if she’ll let me, I’ll explore a little further. “Were you doubting me?” She smiles when she notices the lightness in my voice. “Never.” That’s right, angel. I’ll never let you down. Rachel wiggles in my hold. “You’re strong.” My lips twitch. “Pure steel.” Strong enough to protect you. “Hate to break in here,” says Logan, “but I’ve got a game tomorrow and a full pocket.” I set Rachel on her feet while keeping her tucked beneath my shoulder. “Then let’s go.” Though I consider The Motor Yard safe, it’s still not a good idea to flash money—especially the type of money Logan and I banked tonight. Logan follows me back to my apartment, where we had left his car. Logan hands me his wad of cash. “Have you ever thought of adding a nitro system? Those cars were flying.” I shake my head. “That’ll put us against a different class of cars, and in order to compete in that we’ll have to go bracket racing. Plus, nitro’s some crazy-ass shit. A lot can go wrong.” Logan flashes his not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity grin. “All the more reason to do it. What’s bracket racing?” Leaning against her car, Rachel tunnels her hands into the sleeves of her black coat. She’s cold, and I crave to make her warm. “I’ll explain it later.” Logan’s eyes shift to Rachel. “Got it. See you.” He drives away and I head over to my angel. “Want to see how much we made?” “Definitely.” Rachel allows me to open the door for her in the entrance and to my apartment. Once inside, she slides off her coat and rests it on the kitchen table. In a nervous gesture, she laces her fingers together and glances around the room. “Is your roommate home?” “No,” I say. “He’s staying with Echo tonight. You sure your brother will cover curfew?” She stares at her fingers. “I covered for him last night so he agreed to tonight.” Giving her space, I sit at the card table and begin counting cash. She sinks into the other folding chair and counts the other pile. For a brief few seconds, the only sound in the room is the scratching of dollars moving against each other, and thanks to the crazy bat downstairs, we get to listen to Elvis singing about shoes. “Six hundred,” she says in awe. That would be my winnings. “Four hundred and forty,” I tell her, holding Logan’s stash. Rachel slumps in her seat as if in shock. “Off of your fifty and Logan’s twenty we made one thousand and forty dollars.” She pauses. “That’s not possible.” “It is.” Has it not hit her that in one race on the streets the pot was five thousand dollars? And that was a slow night. She leaves the table and begins to pace. “We’re going to do this, aren’t we? We’re going to pay Eric off and be free of him, and my parents will never know what I did. I mean, we have over two-thousand dollars already.” My mind clears with that info. “How are you coming up with two thousand?” Rachel repeats the endless loop she’s created from one corner of the couch to another. “I have a thousand. A little over five hundred in birthday and Christmas money. I pawned some jewelry for another five hundred. Oh, Isaiah.” Her face flushes. “We’re close to halfway there. We could pay Eric back before the six weeks.” She’s a mixture of anxious and excited, and those feelings become contagious. Knots form in my stomach and I think of the million ways I want to touch her and kiss her and let her know that she’s the only one in my life. What I should tell her is that tonight will be our only money rush. Now that people know how Logan and I race, they’ll either avoid us or not wager as much. I have no doubt we’ll raise the amount we need, but it could still be a struggle. I also decide to keep it to myself that Eric has eyes on us and that he’ll be unhappy we’re making money. Rachel finally stops the frantic path she’s wearing onto the subflooring. Her face beams. She’s light in a world full of darkness. Rachel is happy and that’s all I desire. “We could be together, Isaiah. With no worrying over Eric or debts or anything. We could be happy.” Electricity shoots into my veins and shocks me as if I’ve never been alive. I stand abruptly, knocking over the folding chair. My heart races and this surge is something unknown. Something I don’t understand. Something that fosters confusion, panic. Her eyes glimmer with too much adoration; with too much of an emotion I’ve only seen people give to anyone other than me. I see love in her eyes and it scares the hell out of me. “You need to go,” I say. My voice is deeper than normal and a tremor courses through my body. My eyes burn as a shadow crosses her face, snuffing out all the light. Damn me to hell. I’m the one who created that sorrow. If I stay with her, she’ll never know light and happiness. “Isaiah,” she says carefully. “I don’t understand.” “Go home.” I swipe the money off the table and stalk into the bedroom. With three steps, I circle the room and perform the act again. My thinking is messed up, as if I’m high or took a severe blow to the head. My thoughts detach from my mind, away from my body. “Will you tell me what’s wrong?” comes a soft voice from behind me. Why hasn’t she left? “Nothing. I’m looking for a place to hide the money. This is a shitty place, Rachel, and awful things happen here.” “Like people breaking in,” she says. That’s exactly what can happen. “Just go.” Rachel looks small and defenseless as she rests her temple against the door frame. The dim light of the kitchen silhouettes her frame. Obscured by blackness, I can’t see her face. “You could give the money to me.” Her voice is so soothing that part of me clings to the sound. “Where I live is safe.” My thoughts collide into one another. The back of my legs hit the bed and I sink onto it. My entire life is one long thick rope full of knots and kinks where people have twisted me inside and out. Nothing about me is solid or sturdy. I’m frayed and tattered. “I’m no good, Rachel.” I stare at the cash in my hands. My fingers clench and the money crackles. I won’t lead Rachel further into the abyss. This ends here. It ends tonight. “You need to leave and never come back. I’ll race my car. I’ll pay off the debt. Leave and know I’ll always keep you safe.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-34.html","bookId":2754,"book":{"id":2754,"title":"Crash into You (Pushing the Limits #3)","description":"Storyline: Crash into You (Pushing the Limits #3) The girl with straight As, designer clothes and the perfect life—that\u0027s who people expect Rachel Young to be.
