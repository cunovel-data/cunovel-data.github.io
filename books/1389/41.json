{"id":24035,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"From the time of this arrangement, the ascendance which Mr Naird obtained over the mind of Elinor, by alternate assurances and alarms, relative to her chances of living to see Harleigh again, produced a quiet that gave time to the drafts, which were administered by the physician, to take effect, and she fell into a profound sleep. This, Mr Naird said, might last till late the next day; Ellis, therefore, promising to be ready upon any summons, returned to her lodging. Miss Matson, now, endeavoured to make some enquiries relative to the public suicide projected, if not accomplished, by Miss Joddrel, which was the universal subject of conversation at Brighthelmstone; but when she found it vain to hope for any details, she said, ‘Such accidents, Ma’am, make one really afraid of one’s life with persons one knows nothing of. Pray, Ma’am, if it is not impertinent, do you still hold to your intention of giving up your pretty apartment?’ Ellis answered in the affirmative, desiring, with some surprise, to know, whether the question were in consequence of any apprehension of a similar event. ‘By no means, Ma’am, from you,’ she replied; ‘you, Miss Ellis, who have been so strongly recommended; and protected by so many of our capital gentry; but what I mean is this. If you really intend to take a small lodging, why should not you have my little room again up stairs?’ ‘Is it not engaged to the lady I saw here this morning?’ ‘Why that, Ma’am, is precisely the person I have upon my mind to speak about. Why should I let her stay, when she’s known to nobody, and is very bad pay, if I can have so genteel a young lady as you, Ma’am, that ladies in their own coaches come visiting?’ Ellis, recoiling from this preference, uttered words the most benevolent that she could suggest, of the unknown person who had excited her compassion: but Miss Matson gave them no attention. ‘When one has nothing better to do with one’s rooms, Ma’am,’ she said, ‘it’s sometimes as well, perhaps, to let them to almost one does not know who, as to keep them uninhabited; because living in them airs them; but that’s no reason for letting them to one’s own disadvantage, if can do better. Now this person here, Ma’am, besides being poor, which, poor thing, may be she can’t help; and being a foreigner, which, you know, Ma’am, is no great recommendation;—besides all this, Miss Ellis, she has some very suspicious ways with her, which I can’t make out at all; she goes abroad in a morning, Ma’am, by five of the clock, without giving the least account of her haunts. And that, Ma’am, has but an odd look with it!’ ‘Why so, Miss Matson? If she takes time from her own sleep to enjoy a little air and exercise, where can be the blame?’ ‘Air and exercise, Ma’am? People that have their living to get, and that a’n’t worth a farthing, have other things to think of than air and exercise! She does not, I hope, give herself quite such airs as those!’ Ellis, disgusted, bid her good night; and, filled with pity for a person who seemed still more helpless and destitute than herself, resolved to see her the next day, and endeavour to offer her some consolation, if not assistance. Before, however, this pleasing project could be put into execution, she was again, nearly at day break, awakened by a summons from Selina to attend her sister, who, after quietly reposing many hours, had started, and demanded Harleigh and Ellis. Ellis obeyed the call with the utmost expedition, but met the messenger returning to her a second time, as she was mounting the street which led to the lodging of Mrs Maple, with intelligence that Elinor had almost immediately fallen into a new and sound sleep; and that Mr Naird had ordered that no one should enter the room, till she again awoke. Glad of this reprieve, Ellis was turning back, when she perceived, at some distance, Miss Matson’s new lodger. The opportunity was inviting for her purposed offer of aid, and she determined to make some opening to an acquaintance. This was not easy; for though the light feet of Ellis might soon have overtaken the quick, but staggering steps of the apparently distressed person whom she pursued, she observed her to be in a state of perturbation that intimidated approach, as much as it awakened concern. Her handkerchief was held to her face; though whether to conceal it, or because she was weeping, could not readily be discovered: but her form and air penetrated Ellis with a feeling and an interest far beyond common curiosity; and she anxiously studied how she might better behold, and how address her. The foreigner went on her way, looking neither to the right nor to the left, till she had ascended to the church-yard upon the hill. There stopping, she extended her arms, seeming to hail the full view of the wide spreading ocean; or rather, Ellis imagined, the idea of her native land, which she knew, from that spot, to be its boundary. The beauty of the early morning from that height, the expansive view, impressive, though calm, of the sea, and the awful solitude of the place, would have sufficed to occupy the mind of Ellis, had it not been completely caught by the person whom she followed; and who now, in the persuasion of being wholly alone, gently murmured, ‘Oh ma chère patrie!—malheureuse, coupable,—mais toujours chère patrie!—ne te reverrai-je jamais!’1 Her voice thrilled to the very soul of Ellis, who, trembling, suspended, and almost breathless, stood watching her motions; fearing to startle her by an unexpected approach, and waiting to catch her eye. But the mourner was evidently without suspicion that any one was in sight. Grief is an absorber: it neither seeks nor makes observation; except where it is joined with vanity, that always desires remark; or with guilt, by which remark is always feared. Ellis, neither advancing nor receding, saw her next move solemnly forward, to bend over a small elevation of earth, encircled by short sticks, intersected with rushes. Some of these, which were displaced, she carefully arranged, while uttering, in a gentle murmur, which the profound stillness of all around alone enabled Ellis to catch, ‘Repose toi bien, mon ange! mon enfant! le repos qui me fuit, le bonheur que j’ai perdu, la tranquilité precieuse de l’ame qui m’abandonne—que tout cela soit à toi, mon ange! mon enfant! Je ne te rappellerai plus ici! Je ne te rappellerais plus, même si je le pouvais. Loin de toi ma malheureuse destinée! je priai Dieu pour ta conservation quand je te possedois encore; quelques cruelles que fussent tes souffrances, et toute impuissante que J’etois pour les soulager, je priai Dieu, dans l’angoisse de mon ame, pour ta conservation! Tu n’est plus pour moi—et je cesse de te reclamer. Je te vois une ange! Je te vois exempt à jamais de douleur, de crainte, de pauvreté et de regrets; te reclamerai-je, donc, pour partager encore mes malheurs? Non! ne reviens plus à moi! Que je te retrouve là—où ta félicité sera la mienne! Mais toi, prie pour ta malheureuse mère! que tes innocentes prières s’unissent à ses humbles supplications, pour que ta mère, ta pauvre mère, puisse se rendre digne de te rejoindre!’2 How long these soft addresses, which seemed to soothe the pious petitioner, might have lasted, had she not been disturbed, is uncertain: but she was startled by sounds of more tumultuous sorrow; by sobs, rather than sighs, that seemed bursting forth from more violent, at least, more sudden affliction. She looked round, astonished; and saw Ellis leaning over a monument, and bathed in tears. She arose, and, advancing towards her, said, in an accent of pity, ‘Helas, Madame, vous, aussi, pleurez vous votre enfant?’3 ‘Ah, mon amie! ma bien! ameè amie!’ cried Ellis, wiping her eyes, but vainly attempting to repress fresh tears; ’t’aì-jè chercheè, t’aì-jè attendue, t’aì-jè si ardemment desireè, pour te retrouver ainsi? pleurant sur un tombeau? Et toi!—ne me rappelle tu pas? M’a tu oubliee?—Gabrielle! ma chère Gabrielle!’4 ‘Juste ciel!’ exclaimed the other, ‘que vois-je? Ma Julie! ma chère, ma tendre amie? Est il bien vrai?—O! peut il être vrai, qu’il y ait encore du bonheur ici bas pour moi?’5 Locked in each other’s arms, pressed to each other’s bosoms, they now remained many minutes in speechless agony of emotion, from nearly overpowering surprise, from gusts of ungovernable, irrepressible sorrow, and heart-piercing recollections; though blended with the tenderest sympathy of joy. This touching silent eloquence, these unutterable conflicts between transport and pain, were succeeded by a reciprocation of enquiry, so earnest, so eager, so ardent, that neither of them seemed to have any sensation left of self, from excess of solicitude for the other, till Ellis, looking towards the little grave, said, ‘Ah! que ce ne soit plus question de moi?’6 ‘Ah, oui, mon amie,’ answered Gabriella, ‘ton histoire, tes malheurs, ne peuvent jamais être aussi terribles, aussi dechirants que les miens! tu n’as pas encore eprouvé le bonheur d’être mère—comment aurois-tu, donc, eprouvé, le plus accablant des malheurs? Oh! ce sont des souffrances qui n’ont point de nom; des douleurs qui rendent nulles toutes autres, que la perte d’un Etre p?r comme un ange, et tout à soi!’7 The fond embraces, and fast flowing tears of Ellis, evinced the keen sensibility with which she participated in the sorrows of this afflicted mother, whom she strove to draw away from the fatal spot; reiterating the most urgent enquiries upon every other subject, to attract her, if possible, to yet remaining, to living interests. But these efforts were utterly useless. ‘Restons, restons où nous sommes!’ she cried: ‘c’est ici que je te parlerai; c’est ici que je t’éc?uterai; ici, où je passe les seuls momens que j’arrache à la misere, et au travail. Ne crois pas que de pleurer est ce qu’il y a le plus à craindre! Oh! qu’il ne t’arrive jamais de savoir que de pleurer, même sur le tombeau de tout ce qui vous est le plus cher, est un soulagement, un dèlice, auprès du dur besoin de travailler, la mort dans le c?ur, pour vivre, pour exister, lorsque la vie a perdu toutes ses charmes!’8 Seated then upon the monument which was nearest to the little grave, Gabriella related the principal events of her life, since the period of their separation. These, though frequently extraordinary, sometimes perilous, and always touchingly disastrous, she recounted with a rapidity almost inconceivable; distinctly, nevertheless, marking the several incidents, and the courage with which she had supported them: but when, these finished, she entered upon the history of the illness that had preceded the death of her little son, her voice tremblingly slackened its velocity, and unconsciously lowered its tones; and, far from continuing with the same quickness or precision, every circumstance was dwelt upon as momentous; every recollection brought forth long and endearing details; every misfortune seemed light, put in the scale with his loss; every regret seemed concentrated in his tomb! Six o’clock, and seven, had tolled unheeded, during this afflicting, yet soothing recital; but the eighth hour striking, when the tumult of sorrow was subsiding into the sadness of grief, the sound caught the ear of Gabriella, who, hastily rising, exclaimed, ‘Ah, voilà que je suis encore susceptible de plaisir, puisque ta société m’a fait oublier les tristes et penibles devoirs, qui m’appellent à des taches qui—à peine—m’empêchent de mourir de faim!’9 At these words, all the fortitude hitherto sustained by Juliet,—for the borrowed name of Ellis will now be dropt,—utterly forsook her. Torrents of tears gushed from her eyes, and lamentations, the bitterest, broke from her lips. She could bear, she cried, all but this; all but beholding the friend of her heart, the daughter of her benefactress, torn from the heights of happiness and splendour; of merited happiness, of hereditary splendour; to be plunged into such depths of distress, and overpowered with anguish. ‘Ah! que je te reconnois bien à ce trait!’ cried Gabriella, while a tender smile tried to force its way through her tears: ‘cette ame si noble! si inebralable pour elle-même, si douce, si compatissante pour tout autre! que de souvenirs chers et touchans ne se presentent, à cet instant, à mon c?ur! Ma chère Julie! il est bien vrai, donc, que je te vois, que je te retrouve encore! et, en toi, tout ce qú‘il y a de plus aimable, de plus p?r, et de plus digne! Comment ai-je p? te revoir, sans retrouver la felicité? Je me sens presque coupable de pouvoir t’embrasser,—et de pleurer encore!’10 Forcing herself, then, from the fatal but cherished spot, she must hasten, she said, to her daily labour, lest night should surprise her, without a roof to shelter her head. But Juliet now detained her; clung and wept round her neck, and could not even endeavour to resign herself to the keen woes, and deplorable situation of her friend. She had come over, she said, buoyed up with the exquisite hope of joining the darling companion of her earliest youth; of sharing her fate, and of mitigating her hardships: but this softening expectation was changed into despondence, in discovering her, thus, a prey to unmixt calamity; not alone bowed down by the general evils of revolutionary events; punished for plans in which she had borne no part, and for crimes of which she had not even any knowledge;—not only driven, without offence, or even accusation, from prosperity and honours, to exile, to want, to misery, and to labour; but suffering, at the same time, the heaviest of personal afflictions, in the immediate loss of a darling child; the victim, in all probability, to a melancholy change of life, and to sudden privation of customary care and indulgence! The task of consolation seemed now to devolve upon Gabriella: the feelings of Juliet, long checked by prudence, by fortitude, by imperious necessity; and kept in dignified but hard command; having once found a vent, bounded back to nature and to truth, with a vivacity of keen emotion that made them nearly uncontrollable. Nature and truth,—which invariably retain an elastic power, that no struggles can wholly subdue; and that always, however curbed, however oppressed,—lie in wait for opportunity to spring back to their rights. Her tears, permitted, therefore, at length, to flow, nearly deluged the sad bosom of her friend. ‘Helas, ma Julie! s?ur de mon ame!’ cried Gabriella, ‘ne t’abandonne pas à la douleur pour moi! mais parles moi, ma tendre amie, paries moi de ma mère! Où l’a tu quitte? Et comment? Et à quelle epoque?—La plus digne, la plus cherie des mères! Helas! eloignée de nous deux, comment saura-t-elle se resigner á tant de malheurs?’11 Juliet uttered the tenderest assurances, that she had left the Marchioness well; and had left her by her own injunctions, to join her darling daughter; to whom, by a conveyance that had been deemed secure, she had previously written the plan of the intended journey; with a desire that a few lines of direction, relative to their meeting, under cover to L.S., to be left till called for, might be sent to the post-offices both of Dover and Brighthelmstone; as it was not possible to fix at which spot Juliet might land. The initials L.S. had been fixed upon by accident. Filial anxiety, now, took place of maternal sufferings, and Gabriella could only talk of her mother; demanding how she looked, and how she supported the long separation, the ruinous sacrifices, and the perpetual alarms, to which she must have been condemned since they had parted; expressing her own surprise, that she had borne to dwell upon any other subject than this, which now was the first interest of her heart; yet ceasing to wonder, when she contemplated the fatal spot where her meeting with Juliet had taken place. Each, now, deeply lamented the time and consolation that had been lost, from their mutual ignorance of each other’s abode. Juliet related her fruitless search upon arriving in London; and Gabriella explained, that, during three lingering, yet ever regretted months, she had watched over her dying boy, without writing a single line; to spare her absent friends the knowledge of her suspensive wretchedness. Since the irreparable certainty which had followed, she had sent two letters to her beloved mother, with her address at Brighthelmstone; but both must have miscarried, as she had received no answer. That Juliet had not traced her in London was little wonderful, as, to elude the curiosity excited by a great name, she had passed, in setting out for Brighthelmstone, by a common one. And to that change, joined to one so similar on the part of Juliet, it must have been owing that they had never heard of each other, though residents of the same place. Juliet, nevertheless, was astonished, in defiance of all alteration of attire and appearance, that she had not instantly recognized the air and form of her elegant and high bred Gabriella. But, equally unacquainted with her indigence, which was the effect of sundry cruel accidents, and with the loss of her child; no expectation was awakened of finding her either in so distressed or so solitary a condition. Now, however, Juliet continued, that fortunately, though, alas! not happily, they had met, they would part no more. Juliet was fully at liberty to go whithersoever her friend would lead, the hope of obtaining tidings of that beloved friend, having alone kept her stationary thus long at Brighthelmstone; where she could now leave the address of Gabriella, at the post-office, for their mutual letters: and, as insuperable obstacles impeded her writing herself, at present, to the Marchioness, Gabriella might make known, in a covert manner, that they were together, and were both safe. And why, Gabriella demanded, could not Juliet write herself? ‘Alas!’ Juliet replied, ‘I must not even be named!’ ‘Eh, pour quoi?—n’a-t-tu pas vu tes parens?—Peut on te voir sans t’aimer? te conno?tre sans te cherir? Non, ma Julie, non! tu n’a qu’à te montrer.’12 Juliet, changing colour, dejectedly, and not without confusion, besought her friend, though for reasons that could neither be assigned nor surmounted, to dispense, at present, with all personal narration. Yet, upon perceiving the anxious surprise occasioned by a request so little expected, she dissolved into tears, and offered every communication, in preference to causing even transitory pain to her best friend. ‘O loin de moi cette exigence!’ cried Gabriella, with energy, ‘Ne sais-je pas bien que ton bon esprit, juste émule de ton excellent c?ur, te fera parler lorsqu’il le faudra? Ne me confierai-je pas à toi, dont la seule étude est le bonheur des autres?’13 Juliet, not more penetrated by this kindness, than affected by a facile resignation, that shewed the taming effect of misfortune upon the natural vivacity of her friend, could answer only by caresses and tears. ‘Eh mon oncle?’ continued Gabriella; ‘mon tout-aimable et si pieux oncle? où est il?’14 ‘Monseigneur l’Eveque?’ cried Juliet, again changing colour; ‘Oh oui! tout-aimable! sans tache et sans reproche!—Il sera bient?t, je crois, ici;—ou j’aurois de ses nouvelles; et alors—ma destinée me sera connue!’15 A deep sigh tried to swallow these last words. Gabriella looked at her, for a moment, with re-awakened earnestness, as if repentant of her own acquiescence; but the sight of encreasing disturbance in the countenance of Juliet, checked her rising impatience; and she quietly said, ‘Ah! s’il arrive ici!—si je le revois,—j’éprouverai encore, au milieu de tant de désolation, un mouvement de joie!—tel que toi, seule, jusqu’à ce moment, a su m’en inspirer!’16 Juliet, with fond delight, promised to be governed wholly, in her future plans, occupations, and residence, by her beloved friend. ‘C’est à Brighthelmstone, donc,’ cried Gabriella, returning to the little grave; ‘c’est ici que nous demeurions! ici, où il me semble que je n’ai pas encore tout à fait perdu mon fils!’ Then, tenderly embracing Juliet, ‘Ah, mon amie!’ she cried, with a smile that blended pleasure with agony; ‘ah, mon amie! c’est à mon enfant que je te dois! c’est en pleurant sur ses restes que je t’ai retrouvée! Ah, oui!’ passionately bending over the grave; ‘c’est à toi, mon ange! mon enfant! que je dois mon amie! Ton tombeau, même, me porte bonheur! tes cendres veulent me bénir! tes restes, ton ombre veulent du bien à ta pauvre mère!’17 With difficulty, now, Juliet drew her away from the fond, fatal spot; and slowly, and silently, while clinging to each other with heartfelt affection, they returned together to their lodgings.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1418/42570.html","bookId":1389,"book":{"id":1389,"title":"The Wanderer 徘徊者","description":"简介： During the dire reign of the terrific Robespierre, and in the dead of night, braving the cold, the darkness and the damps of December, some English passengers, in a small vessel, were preparing to glide silently from the coast of France, when a voice...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1418","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM"}}
