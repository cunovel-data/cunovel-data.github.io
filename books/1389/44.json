{"id":24038,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 44","content":"Juliet, in re-mounting the stairs, was stopt, by her new acquaintance, before the door of his apartment. ‘If you knew,’ he said, ‘how despitefully I have been treated, and how miserably black and blue I have been pinched, by the little Imp whose offer you have rejected, sleep would fly your eyes at night, from remorse for your hardness of heart. Its Impship insists upon it, that the fault must all be mine. What! it cries, would you persuade me, that a young creature whose face beams with celestial sweetness, whose voice is the voice of melody, whose eyes have the softness of the Dove’s—’ Juliet, though she smiled, would have escaped; but he told her he must be heard. ‘Would you persuade me, quoth my sprite, that such an angelic personage, would rather let my poor despised coin canker and rust in your miserly coffers, than disperse it about in the world, in kind, generous, or useful activity? No, my antique, continues my little elf, you have presented it in some clumsy, hunchy, awkward mode, that has made her deem you an unworthy bearer of fairy gifts; and she flies the downy wings of my gentle succour, from the fear of falling into your rough and uncooth claws.’ Juliet, who now, through the ill-closed fingers of his gouty hand, discerned his prepared purse, seriously begged to decline this discussion. ‘What malice you must bear me!’ he cried. ‘You are surely in the pay of my evil genius! and I shall be whipt with nettles, or scratched with thorns, all night, in revenge of my failure! And that parcel, too,—which strains the fine fibres of your fair hands,—cast it but down, and millions of my little elves will struggle to convey it safely to your chamber.’ ‘I doubt not their dexterity,’ answered Juliet, ‘nor the benevolence of their fabricator; but I assure you, Sir, I want no help.’ ‘If you will not accept their aerial services, deign, at least, not to refuse mine!’ He endeavoured, now, to take the gown-packet into his own hands; laughingly saying, upon her grave resistance, ‘Beware, fair nymph, of the dormant sensations which you may awaken, if you should make me suppose you afraid of me! Many a long day is past, alas! and gone, since I could flatter myself with the idea of exciting fear in a young breast!’ Ceasing, however, the attempt, after some courteous apologies, he respectfully let her pass. But, upon entering her room, she heard something chink as she deposited her parcel upon a table; and, upon examination, found that he had managed to slip into it, during the contest, a little green purse. Vexed at this contrivance, and resolved not to lose an instant in returning what no distress could induce her to retain, she immediately descended; but the staircase was vacant, and the door was closed. Fearful any delay might authorize a presumption of acceptance, she assumed courage to tap at the door. A scampering, at the same moment, up the stairs, made her instantly regret this measure; and by no means the less, for finding herself recognized, and abruptly accosted by young Gooch, the farmer’s son, at the very moment that her gouty admirer had hobbled to answer to her summons. ‘Well, see if I a’n’t a good marksman!’ he cried; ‘for else, Ma’am, I might have passed you; for they told me, below, you were up there, at the very top of the house. But I’d warrant to pick you out from a hundred, Ma’am; as neat as my father would one of his stray sheep. But what I come for, Ma’am, is to ask the favour of your company, if it’s agreeable to you, to a little junket at our farm.’ Then, rubbing his hands with great glee, unregarding the surprised look of Juliet, at such an invitation, or the amused watchfulness of the observant old beau, he went glibly on. ‘Father’s to give it, Ma’am. You never saw old dad, I believe, Ma’am? The old gentleman’s a very good old chap; only he don’t like our clubs: for he says they make me speak quite in the new manner; so that the farmers, he says, don’t know what I’d be at. He’s rather in years, Ma’am, poor man. He don’t know much how things go. However, he’s a very well meaning old gentleman.’ Juliet gravely enquired, to what unknown accident she might attribute an invitation so unexpected? ‘Why, Ma’am,’ answered Gooch, delighted at the idea of having given her an agreeable surprize, ‘Why it’s the ‘Squire, Ma’am, that put it into my head. You know who I mean? our rich cousin, ‘Squire Tedman. He’s a great friend of yours, I can assure you, Ma’am. He wants you to take a little pleasure sadly. And he’s sadly afraid, too, he says, that you’ll miss him, now he’s gone to town; for he used often, he says, to bring you one odd thing or another. He’s got a fine fortune of his own, my cousin the ‘Squire. And he’s a widower.—And he’s taken a vast liking to you, I can tell you, Ma’am;—so who knows....’ Juliet would have been perfectly unmoved by this ignorant forwardness, but for the presence of a stranger, to whose good opinion, after her experience of his benevolence, she could not be indifferent. With an air, therefore, that marked her little satisfaction at this familiar jocoseness, she declined the invitation; and begged the young man to acquaint Mr Tedman, that, though obliged to his intentions, she should feel a yet higher obligation in his forbearance to forward to her, in future, any similar proposals. ‘Why, Ma’am,’ cried young Gooch, astonished, ‘this i’n’t a thing you can get at every day! We shall have all the main farmers of the neighbourhood! for it’s given on account of a bargain that we’ve made, of a nice little slip of land, just by our square hay-field. And I’ve leave to choose six of the company myself. But they won’t be farmers, Ma’am, I can tell you! They’ll be young fellows that know better how the world goes. And we shall have your good friend ‘Squire Stubbs; for it’s he that made our bargain.’ Juliet, now, turning from him to the silent, remarking stranger, said, ‘I am extremely ashamed, Sir, to obtrude thus upon your time, but the person for whom you so generously destined this donation commissions me to return it, with many thanks, and an assurance that it is not at all wanted.’ She held out her hand with the purse, but, drawing back from receiving it, ‘Madam,’ he cried, ‘I would upon no account offend any one who has the honour of being known to you; but you will not, therefore, I hope, insist that I should quarrel with myself, by taking what does not belong to me?’ While Juliet, now, looked wistfully around, to discover some place where she might drop the purse, unseen by the young man, whose misinterpretations might be injurious, the youth volubly continued his own discourse. ‘We shall give a pretty good entertainment in the way of supper, I assure you, Ma’am; for we shall have a goose at top, and a turkey at bottom, and as fine a fat pig as ever you saw in your life in the middle; with as much ale, and mead, and punch, as you can desire to drink. And, as all my sisters are at home, and a brace or so of nice young lasses of their acquaintance, besides ever so many farmers, and us seven stout young fellows of my club, into the bargain, we intend to kick up a dance. It may keep you out a little late, to be sure, Ma’am, but you shall have our chay-cart to bring you home. You know our chay-cart of old, Ma’am?’ ‘I, Sir?’ ‘Why, lauk! have you forgot that, Ma’am? Why it’s our chay-cart that brought you to Brighton, from Madam Maple’s at Lewes, as good as half a year ago. Don’t you remember little Jack, that drove you? and that went for you again the next day, to fetch you back?’ Juliet now found, that this was the carriage procured for her by Harleigh, upon her first arrival at Lewes; and, though chagrined at the air of former, or disguised intimacy, which such an incident might seem to convey to her new friend, she immediately acknowledged recollecting the circumstance. ‘Well, I’m only sorry, Ma’am, I did not drive you myself; but I had not the pleasure of your acquaintance then, Ma’am; for ’twas before of our acting together.’ The surprise of the listening old gentleman now altered its expression, from earnest curiosity to suppressed pleasantry; and he leant against his door, to take a pinch of snuff, with an air that denoted him to be rather waiting for some expected amusement, than watching, as heretofore, for some interesting explanation. Juliet, in discerning the passing change in his ideas, became more than ever eager to return the purse; yet more than ever fearful of misconstruction from young Gooch; whom she now, with encreased dissatisfaction, begged to lose no time in acquainting Mr Tedman, that business only ever took her from home. ‘Why, that’s but moping for you, neither, Ma’am,’ he answered, in a tone of pity. ‘You’d have double the spirits if you’d go a little abroad; for staying within doors gives one but a hippish turn. It will go nigh to make you grow quite melancholick, Ma’am.’ Hopeless to get rid either of him or of the purse, Juliet, now, was moving up stairs, when the voice of Miss Bydel called out from the passage, ‘Why, Mr Gooch, have you forgot I told you to send Mrs Ellis to me?’ ‘That I had clean!’ he answered. ‘I ask your pardon, I’m sure, Ma’am.—Why, Ma’am, Miss Bydel told me to tell you, when I said I was coming up to ask you to our junket, that she wanted to say a word or two to you, down in the shop, upon business.’ Juliet would have descended; but Miss Bydel, desiring her to wait, mounted herself, saying, ‘I have a mind to see your little new room:’ stopping, however, when she came to the landing-place, which was square and large, ‘Well-a-day!’ she exclaimed: ‘Sir Jaspar Herrington!—who’d have thought of seeing you, standing so quietly at your door? Why I did not know you could stand at all! Why how is your gout, my good Sir? And how do you like your new lodgings? I heard of your being here from Miss Matson. But pray, Mrs Ellis, what has kept you both, you and young Mr Gooch, in such close conference with Sir Jaspar? I can’t think what you’ve been talking of so long. Pray how did you come to be so intimate together? I should like to know that.’ Sir Jaspar courteously invited Miss Bydel to enter his apartment; but that lady, not aware that nothing is less delicate than professions of delicacy; which degrade a just perception, and strict practice of propriety, into a display of conscious caution, or a suspicion of evil interpretation; almost angrily answered, that she could not for the world do such a thing, for it would set every body a talking: ‘for, as I’m not married, Sir Jaspar, you know, and as you’re a single gentleman, too, it might make Miss Matson and her young ladies think I don’t know what. For, when once people’s tongues are set a-going, it’s soon too late to stop them. Besides, every body’s always so prodigious curious to dive into other people’s affairs, that one can’t well be too prudent.’ Sir Jaspar, with an arched brow, of which she was far from comprehending the meaning, said that he acquiesced in her better judgment; but, as she had announced that she came to speak with this young lady upon business, he enquired, whether there would be any incongruity in putting a couple of chairs upon the landing-place. ‘Well,’ she cried, ‘that’s a bright thought, I declare, Sir Jaspar! for it will save me the trouble of groping up stairs;’ and then, seizing the opportunity to peep into his room, she broke forth into warm exclamations of pleasure, at the many nice and new things with which it had been furnished, since it had been vacated by Mrs Ellis. A look, highly commiserating, shewed him shocked by these observations; and the air, patiently calm, with which they were heard by Juliet, augmented his interest, as well as wonder, in her story and situation. He ordered his valet to fetch an arm-chair for Miss Bydel; while, evidently meant for Juliet, he began to drag another forward himself. ‘Bless me, Sir Jaspar!’ cried Miss Bydel, looking, a little affronted, towards Juliet, ‘have you no common chairs?’ ‘Yes,’ he answered, still labouring on, ‘for common purposes!’ This civility was not lost upon Juliet, who declining, though thankful for his attention, darted forward, to take, for herself, a seat of less dignity; hastily, as she passed, dropping the purse upon a table. A glance at Sir Jaspar sufficed to assure her, that this action had not escaped his notice; and though his look spoke disappointment, it shewed him sensible of the propriety of avoiding any contest. Relieved from this burthen, she now cheerfully waited to hear the orders of Miss Bydel: young Gooch waited to hear them also; seated, cross-legged, upon the balustrade; though Sir Jaspar sent his valet away, and, retired, scrupulously, himself, to the further end of his apartment. Miss Bydel, as little struck with the ill breeding of the young farmer, as with the good manners of the baronet, forgot her business, from recollecting that Mr Scope was waiting for her in the shop. ‘For happening,’ said she, ‘to pass by, and see me, through the glass-door, he just stept in, on purpose to have a little chat.’ ‘O ho, what, is ‘Squire Scope here?’ cried young Gooch; and, rapidly sliding down the banisters, seized upon the unwilling and precise Mr Scope, whom he dragged up to the landing-place. ‘Well, this is droll enough!’ cried Miss Bydel, palpably enchanted, though trying to look displeased; ‘only I hope you have not told Mr Scope ’twas I that sent you for him, Mr Gooch? for, I assure you, Mr Scope, I would not do such a thing for the world. I should think it quite improper. Besides, what will Miss Matson and the young milliners say? Who knows but you may have set them a prating, Mr Gooch? It’s no joke, I can assure you, doing things of this sort.’ ‘I’m sure, Ma’am,’ said Gooch, ‘I thought you wanted to see the ‘Squire; for I did not do it in the least to make game.’ ‘There can be no doubt, Madam,’ said Mr Scope, somewhat offended, ‘that all descriptions of sport are not, at all times, advisable. For, in small societies, as in great states, if I may be permitted to compare little things with great ones, danger often lurks unseen, and mischief breaks out from trifles. In like manner, for example, if one of those young milliners, misinterpreting my innocence, in obeying the supposed commands of the good Miss Bydel, should take the liberty to laugh at my expence, what, you might ask, could it signify that a young girl should laugh? Young persons, especially of the female gender, being naturally given to laughter, at very small provocatives; not to say sometimes without any whatsoever. Whereupon, persons of an ordinary judgment, may conclude such an action, by which I mean laughing, to be of no consequence.—’ ‘But I think it very rude!’ cried Miss Bydel, extremely nettled. ‘Please to hear me, Madam!’ said Mr Scope. ‘Persons, I say, of deeper knowledge in the maxims and manners of the moral world, would look forward with watchfulness, on such an occasion, to its future effects; for one laugh breeds another, and another breeds another; for nothing is so catching as laughing; I mean among the vulgar; in which class I would be understood to include the main mass of a great nation. What, I ask, ensues?—’ ‘O, as to that, Mr Scope,’ cried Miss Bydel, rather impatiently, ‘I assure you if I knew any body that took such a liberty as to laugh at me, I should let them know my thoughts of such airs without much ceremony!’ ‘My very good lady,’ said Mr Scope, formally bowing, ‘if I may request such a favour, I beg you to be silent. The laugh, I observe, caught thus, from one to another, soon spreads abroad; and then, the more aged, or better informed, may be led to enquire into its origin: and the result of such investigation must needs be, that the worthy Miss Bydel, having sent her commands to her humble servant, Mr Scope, to follow her up stairs—’ ‘But if they said that,’ cried Miss Bydel, looking very red, ‘it would be as great a fib as ever was told, for I did not send my commands, nor think of such a thing. It was Mr Gooch’s own doing, only for his own nonsense. And I am curious to know, Mr Gooch, whether any body ever put such thoughts into your head? Pray did you ever hear any body talk, Mr Gooch? For, if you have, I should be glad to know what they said.’ Mr Scope, waving his hand to demand attention, again begged leave to remark, that he had not finished what he purposed to advance. ‘My argument, Madam,’ he resumed, ‘is a short, but, I hope, a clear one, for ’tis deduced from general principles and analogy; though, upon a merely cursory view, it may appear somewhat abstruse. But what I mean, in two words, is, that the laugh raised by Mr Gooch, and those young milliners; taking it for granted that they laughed; which, indeed, I rather think I heard them do; may, in itself, perhaps, as only announcing incapacity, not be condemnable; but when it turns out that it promulgates false reports, and makes two worthy persons, if I may take the liberty to name myself with the excellent Miss Bydel, appear to be fit subjects for ridicule; then, indeed, the laugh is no longer innocent; and ought, in strict justice, to be punished, as seriously as any other mode of propagating false rumours.’ Miss Bydel, after protesting that Mr Scope talked so prodigiously sensible, that she was never tired of hearing him, for all his speeches were so long; abruptly told Juliet, that she had called to let her know, that she should be glad to be paid, out of hand, the money which she had advanced for the harp. Sir Jaspar, who, during the harangue of Mr Scope, which was uttered in too loud and important a manner, to leave any doubt of its being intended for general hearing; had drawn his chair to join the party, listened to this demand with peculiar attention; and was struck with the evident distress which it caused to Juliet; who fearfully besought a little longer law, to collect the debts of others, that she might be able to discharge her own. Young Gooch, coming behind her, said, in a half whisper, ‘If you’ll tell me how much it is you owe, Ma’am, I’ll help you out in a trice; for I can have what credit I will in my father’s name; and he’ll never know but what ’twas for some frolic of my own; for I don’t make much of a confidant of the old gentleman.’ The most icy refusal was insufficient to get rid of this offer, or offerer; who assured her that, if the worst came to the worst, and his father, by ill luck, should find them out, he would not make a fuss for above a day or two; ‘because,’ he continued, ‘he has only me, as one may say, for the rest are nothing but girls; so he can’t well help himself. He gave me my swing too long from the first, to bind me down at this time of day. Besides, he likes to have me a little in the fashion, I know, though he won’t own it; for he is a very good sort of an old gentleman, at bottom.’ Sir Jaspar sought to discover, whether the colour which heightened the cheeks of Juliet at this proposal, which now ceased to be delivered in a whisper, was owing to confusion at its publicity, or to disdain at the idea of conspiring either at deceiving or braving the young man’s father; while Miss Bydel, whose plump curiosity saved her from all species of speculative trouble, bluntly said, ‘Why should you hesitate at such an offer, my dear? I’m sure I don’t see how you can do better than accept it. Mr Gooch is a very worthy young man, and so are all his family. I’m sure I only wish he’d take to you more solidly, and make a match of it. That would put an end to your troubles at once; and I should get my money out of hand.’ This was an opportunity not to be passed over by the argumentative but unerring Mr Scope, for trite observations, self-evident truths, and hackneyed calculations, upon the mingled dangers and advantages of matrimony, ‘which, when weighed,’ said he, ‘in equal scales, and abstractedly considered, are of so puzzling a nature, that the wise and wary, fearing to risk them, remain single; but which, when looked upon in a more cursory way, or only lightly balanced, preponderate so much in favour of the state, that the great mass of the nation, having but small means of reflection, or forethought, ordinarily prefer matrimony. If, therefore, young Mr Gooch should think proper to espouse this young person, there would be nothing in it very surprising; nevertheless, in summing up the expences of wedlock, and a growing family, it might seem, that to begin the married state with debts already contracted, on the female side, would appear but a shallow mark of prudence on the male, where the cares of that state reasonably devolve; he being naturally supposed to have the most sense.’ ‘O, as to that, Mr Scope,’ cried Miss Bydel, ‘if Mr Gooch should take a liking to this young person, she has money enough to pay her debts, I can assure you: I should not have asked her for it else; but the thing is, she don’t like to part with it.’ Juliet solemnly protested, that the severest necessity could alone have brought her into the pecuniary difficulties under which she laboured; the money to which Miss Bydel alluded being merely a deposit which she held in her hands, and for which she was accountable. ‘Well, that’s droll enough,’ said Miss Bydel, ‘that a young person, not worth a penny in the world, should have the care of other people’s money! I should like to know what sort of persons they must be, that can think of making such a person their steward!’ Young Gooch said that it would not be his father, for one, who would do it; and Mr Scope was preparing an elaborate dissertation upon the nature of confidence, with regard to money-matters, in a great state; when Miss Bydel, charmed to have pronounced a sentence which seemed to accord with every one’s opinion, ostentatiously added, ‘I should like, I say, Mrs Ellis, to know what sort of person it could be, that would trust a person with one’s cash, without enquiring into their circumstances? for though, upon hearing that a person has got nothing, one may give ’em something, one must be no better than a fool to make them one’s banker.’ Juliet, who could not enter into any explanation, stammered, coloured, and from the horrour of seeing that she was suspected, wore an air of seeming apprehensive of detection. A short pause ensued, during which every one fixed his eyes upon her face, save Sir Jaspar; who seemed studying a portrait upon his snuff-box. Her immediate wish, in this disturbance, was to clear herself from so terrible an aspersion, by paying Miss Bydel, as she had paid her other creditors, from the store of Harleigh; but her wishes, tamed now by misfortune and disappointment, were too submissively under the controul of fear and discretion, to suffer her to act from their first dictates: and a moment’s reflection pointed out, that, joined to the impropriety of such a measure with respect to Harleigh himself, it would be liable, more than any other, to give her the air of an impostor, who possessed money that she could either employ, or disclaim all title to, at her pleasure. Calling, therefore, for composure from conscious integrity, she made known her project of applying once more to Miss Matson, for work; and earnestly supplicated for the influence of Miss Bydel, that this second application might not, also, be vain. The eyes of the attentive Sir Jaspar, as he raised them from his snuff-box, now spoke respect mingled with pity. ‘As to recommending you to Miss Matson, Mrs Ellis,’ answered Miss Bydel, ‘it’s out of all reason to demand such a thing, when I can’t tell who you are myself; and only know that you have got money in your hands nobody knows how, nor what for.’ An implication such as this, nearly overpowered the fortitude of Juliet; and, relinquishing all further effort, she rose, and, silently, almost gloomily, began ascending the stairs. Sir Jaspar caught the expression of her despair by a glance; and, in a tone of remonstrance, said to Miss Bydel, ‘In your debt, good Miss Bydel? Have you forgotten, then, that the young lady has paid you?’ ‘Paid me? good Me! Sir Jaspar,’ cried Miss Bydel, staring; ‘how can you say such a thing? Do you think I’d cheat the young woman?’ ‘I think it so little,’ answered he, calmly, ‘that I venture to remind you, thus publicly, of the circumstance; in full persuasion that I shall merit your gratitude, by aiding your memory.’ ‘Good Me! Sir Jaspar, why I never heard such a thing in my life! Paid me? When? Why it can’t be without my knowing it?’ ‘Certainly not; I beg you, therefore, to recollect yourself.’ The stare of Miss Bydel was now caught by Mr Scope; and her ‘Good Me!’ was echoed by young Gooch; while the surprised Juliet, turning back, said, ‘Pardon me, Sir! I have never been so happy as to be able to discharge the debt. It remains in full force.’ ‘Over you, too, then,’ cried Sir Jaspar, with quickness, ‘have I the advantage in memory? Have you forgotten that you delivered, to Miss Bydel, the full sum, not twenty minutes since?’ Miss Bydel now, reddening with anger, cried, ‘Sir Jaspar, I have long enough heard of your ill nature; but I never suspected your crossness would take such a turn against a person as this, to make people believe I demand what is not my own!’ Juliet again solemnly acknowledged the debt; and Mr Scope opened an harangue upon the merits of exactitude between debtor and creditor, and the usefulness of settling no accounts, without, what were the only legal witnesses to obviate financial controversy, receipts in full; when Sir Jaspar, disregarding, alike, his rhetoric or Miss Bydel’s choler, quietly patting his snuff-box, said, that it was possible that Miss Bydel had, inadvertently, put the sum into her work-bag, and forgotten that it had been refunded. Exulting that means, now, were open for vindication and redress, Miss Bydel eagerly untied the strings of her work-bag; though Juliet entreated that she would spare herself the useless trouble. But Sir Jaspar protested, with great gravity, that his own honour was now as deeply engaged to prove an affirmative, as that of Miss Bydel to prove a negative: holding, however, her hand, he said that he could not be satisfied, unless the complete contents of the work-bag were openly and fairly emptied upon a table, in sight of the whole party. Miss Bydel, though extremely affronted, consented to this proposal; which would clear her, she said, of so false a slander. A table was then brought upon the landing-place; as she still stiffly refused risking her reputation, by entering the apartment of a single gentleman; though he might not, as she observed, be one of the youngest. Sir Jaspar demanded the precise amount of the sum owed. A guinea and a half. He then fetched a curious little japan basket from his chamber, into which he desired that Miss Bydel would put her work-bag; though he would not suffer her to empty it, till, with various formalities, he had himself placed it in the middle of the table; around which he made every one draw a chair. Miss Bydel now triumphantly turned her work-bag inside out; but what was her consternation, what the shock of Mr Scope, and how loud the shout of young Gooch, to see, from a small open green purse, fall a guinea and a half! Miss Bydel, utterly confounded, remained speechless; but Juliet, through whose sadness Sir Jaspar saw a smile force its way, that rendered her beauty dazzling, recollecting the purse, blushed, and would have relieved Miss Bydel, by confessing that she knew to whom it belonged; had she not been withheld by the fear of the strange appearance which so sudden a seeming intimacy with the Baronet might wear. Sir Jaspar, again patting her snuff-box, composedly said, ‘I was persuaded Miss Bydel would find that her debt had been discharged.’ Miss Bydel remained stupified; while Mr Scope, with a look concerned, and even abashed, condolingly began an harangue upon the frail tenure of the faculty of human memory. Miss Bydel, at length, recovering her speech, exclaimed, ‘Well, here’s the money, that’s certain! but which way it has got into my work-bag, without my ever seeing or touching it, I can’t pretend to say: but if Mrs Ellis has done it to play me a trick—’ Juliet disavowed all share in the transaction. ‘Then it’s some joke of Sir Jaspar’s! for I know he dearly loves to mortify; so I suppose he has given me false coin, or something that won’t go, just to make me look like a fool.’ ‘The money, I have the honour to assure you, is not mine,’ was all that, very tranquilly, Sir Jaspar replied: while Mr Scope, after a careful examination of each piece, declared each to be good gold, and full weight. Sundry ‘Good me’s!’ and other expressions of surprise, though all of a pleasurable sort, now broke forth from Miss Bydel, finishing with, ‘However, if nobody will own the money, as the debt is fairly my due, I don’t see why I may not take it; though as to the purse, I won’t touch it, because as that’s a thing I have not lent to any body, I’ve no right to it.’ Juliet here warmly interfered. The purse, she said, and the money belonged to the same proprietor; and, as neither of them were hers, both ought to be regarded as equally inadmissible for the payment of a debt which she alone had contracted. This disinterested sincerity made even Mr Scope turn to her with an air of profound, though surprised respect; while Sir Jaspar fixed his eyes upon her face with encreased and the most lively wonder; young Gooch stared, not perfectly understanding her; but Miss Bydel, rolling up the purse, which she put back into the basket, said, ‘Well, if the money is not yours, Mrs Ellis, my dear, it can be nobody’s but Sir Jaspar’s; and if he has a mind to pay your debt for you, I don’t see why I should hinder him, when ’twould be so much to my disadvantage. He’s rich enough, I assure you; for what has an old bachelor to do with his money? So I’ll take my due, be it which way it will.’ And, unmoved by all that Juliet could urge, she put the guinea and the half-guinea carefully into her pocket. Juliet declared, that a debt which she had not herself discharged, she should always consider as unpaid, though her creditor might be changed. Confused then, ashamed, perplexed,—yet unavoidably pleased, she mounted to her chamber.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1418/42573.html","bookId":1389,"book":{"id":1389,"title":"The Wanderer 徘徊者","description":"简介： During the dire reign of the terrific Robespierre, and in the dead of night, braving the cold, the darkness and the damps of December, some English passengers, in a small vessel, were preparing to glide silently from the coast of France, when a voice...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1418","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM"}}
