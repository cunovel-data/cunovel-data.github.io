{"id":97211,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"The Lidesci\u0027s StorySilently closing the file, Jake started as Liz\u0027s voice reached him through the vacuum of concentration - a zone exclusive to his mind and the words that the file had left mirrored upon it - which had somehow settled about him. \u0027Well?\u0027 she said.And surprising himself, frowning he answered, \u0027Where have I read this before? I mean, do I know these things?\u0027 Too late, for the vacuum was dissolving, the familiarity fading. \u0027No, of course I don\u0027t.\u0027 And shaking his head, perhaps to clear it, he looked at her.\u0027No questions?\u0027 she said, staring hard at him.\u0027Should there be?\u0027Liz shrugged, but not casually. \u0027You tell me, Jake. All I can tell you is that for the last half hour you\u0027ve been sitting there like a man in a dream, totally engrossed.\u0027Learning? ht wondered. Or remembering? But aloud he only said, \u0027Well, a couple of questions, maybe.\u0027\u0027Like what?\u0027\u0027Oh, one or two ambiguities. Anyway, I think I\u0027ve already worked out some of the answers.\u0027\u0027Go on/ \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027this file cover, for one thing. It has a few dents in it... it\u0027s obviously not new. In fact, it\u0027s got to be years old. As for this label on the cover, it\u0027s been thumbed to death! But these pages, I mean the paper itself, is new, and the text has at least one glaring ambiguity/ \u0027Oh?\u0027He nodded. \u0027It talks about an underground exit in the Carpathian foothills - one underground exit, that is. But it also mentions Gustav Turchin, and how he flooded a Gate in Perchorsk in the Urals/ He frowned again and continued, Tunny, but when I was reading this stuff it seemed to make sense. I don\u0027t know, I seemed to understand. But now I only remember the text/\u0027Like ... Eureka!\u0027 Liz said. \u0027That word on the tip of your tongue. That abrupt but transient flash of insight. It\u0027s there, and it\u0027s gone. Right?\u0027Jake knew she was fishing - albeit for something he wasn\u0027t able to give her, not yet - and said, \u0027Weren\u0027t we talking about Gates?\u0027\u0027There are two/ she answered. \u0027The one under the Carpatii Meridionali is the original; it occurred naturally and has been there for - well, no one knows how long. It\u0027s like a black hole, or perhaps a grey hole, and its other end comes out in Starside in a vampire world. A long time ago, warrior Lords would throw their conquered enemies into it. It\u0027s how vampires got here in the first place/Jake accepted that; it felt real, he knew it was so. \u0027And the other?\u0027\u0027Is man-made/ Liz told him. And settling back, she said, \u0027This is how the story goes:\u0027Thirty years ago the Americans put one over on the Soviets. A \\\u003eig one, that is. And good for them - for us, the whole world - too, because since World War Two the Russians had been bluffing the West right out of its pants. Kennedy was the first US President to call that bluff, over Cuba. Later, Ronald Reagan and Maggie Thatcher would have their say. They just said no. Thatcher was good at that/\u0027Said no to what?\u0027 Jake was no historian.\u0027To the Russian military build-up/ she answered. \u0027To trying to keep up with all of that expenditure on ships, aircraft, bombs, the space race. And so President Reagan or his advisors invented SDI, the Space Defense Initiative.\u0027\u0027\"Star Wars?\u0027\" He remembered that much, at least.\u0027Right,\u0027 Liz said. \u0027A fantasy scenario if ever there was one. And the Soviets fell for it. Now the boot was on the other foot and eventually their expenditure went over the top. It was probably the beginning of the end for Russian Communism. But in the early \u002780s, while they were still financially stable, their top boffins and physicists were tasked to dream up an answer to the USA\u0027s SDI - a programme that didn\u0027t exist except on paper, and very thin paper at that.\u0027Well, that\u0027s what Perchorsk was all about. They built a dam across a powerful watercourse in a ravine to give them the hydroelectric power they needed, also to give them some camouflage against the West\u0027s spy satellites - which was something else that didn\u0027t work - and carved out a subterranean complex from the bedrock. They put in an atomic pile to boost the project\u0027s energy requirements, and bingo, they were in business. But they very quickly went out of business.\u0027The idea was ... I don\u0027t know, some kind of radar? A fan of energy raking the sky, covering all the north-western territories of the then Soviet Union. It was an experiment, but if it had worked they\u0027d have built more complexes just like it as \"defensive\" measures against incoming missiles or bombers. Hitting that fan would be like running into a brick wall; nothing was going to be able to get through. In effect, a force-screen. Huh! Talk about an \"Iron Curtain?\" And what price SDI then, eh? Except of course, there was no SDI... \u0027... And no force-screen, either. During the first test it backfired, the pile imploded and a new kind of energy - or perhaps a different and extremely primal kind of energy, a different kind of heat - was discovered. And where the pile had been, right at the core of the Perchorsk Complex, there was this ... well, this hole. This hole that went right through the wall of our universe. In Starside the new singularity appeared in close proximity to the original, the \"natural\" one. So - \u0027 \u0027 - So,\u0027 Jake took it up, \u0027when Turchin flooded the Perchorsk complex he drowned both Gates on Starside, making any sort of travel through them impossible.\u0027She smiled at him. \u0027For someone who hasn\u0027t read the files, you figured that out pretty quickly!\u0027 Which gave him pause, because he\u0027d been thinking much the same thing; and again he knew that what she\u0027d told him was so.But Liz was already going on; \u0027Well, there you have it, the answer to at least one of your ambiguities. Now, what about the others?\u0027\u0027Just one other/ Jake told her, \u0027but a difficult one. In a way it makes no sense, while in another - in the light of our involvement - it makes too much sense. The file talks about how the Gates were closed, \"drowned\" by Gustav Turchin, which \"guaranteed\" Earth\u0027s safety. Similarly, it talks about Harry and Nathan Keogh, father and son, men whom it credits with \"destroying\" the Wamphyri. But if the world is safe and the danger past, why is all of this information laid out in the present tense? Also, how can it possibly fit with what we saw and did last night?\u0027Liz nodded. \u0027This is the bit you already have the answers for, right? It\u0027s self-explanatory. Well, you\u0027re correct. Those inserts in the file are brand new, hastily prepared, and incomplete. Makeshift replacements for the old text that used to be in the past tense, which is now present tense because - \u0027\u0027Because that\u0027s the nature of the problem,\u0027 Jake finished it for her. \u0027As we saw last night, it\u0027s here and now. Not left for dead in another world\u0027s past, but alive and well and horribly real in our world\u0027s present. Fine, or not so fine, whichever - but it still doesn\u0027t answer my questions, doesn\u0027t tell me where I fit in.\u0027Liz tossed her head. \u0027I, I, bloody I!\u0027 she said. \u0027Is that all you exist for, Jake? You?\u0027 But he could get just as irritated, and:\u0027No,\u0027 he rasped. \u0027I exist for something else. Something I haven\u0027t finished, that I still have to do and that all of this is pushing to one side.\"\u0027Jake?\u0027 came a gruff query from out in the morning. \u0027Jake Cutter? Is that you in there, huffing and puffing again?\u0027 Lardis Lidesci, his shadow falling across the tent\u0027s doorway.\u0027Right on cue,\u0027 Liz snapped. \u0027And very welcome. If anyone can answer your questions, Lardis can. He\u0027ll certainly be able to add to your knowledge, anyway. And if nothing else comes of it at least I\u0027ll get a break from your moaning, and find something better to do with all of the valuable time I\u0027m currently wasting on you.\"E-Branch staff and espers were busy all around the camp, stripping personal and Branch kit and equipment from the vehicles. A lot of the \u0027gadgetry\u0027 - the hardware in the Ops vehicle - was in reality common-or-garden stuff, computers and communications equipment on loan from the Australian Army along with the truck itself. Mobility would be the key word in any future war - the mobility of Ops Centres, that is, and war meaning any \u0027conventional\u0027 war between nations, not species - and all of the WACs, the Western Alliance Countries, used compatible equipment. But the software and such belonged to E-Branch. And just as Trask\u0027s people had been thorough in cleaning up last night\u0027s mess, now they were being thorough in removing every last trace of their work and presence here. For, as Trask had pointed out, covert organizations such as E-Branch couldn\u0027t remain secret if too many people knew about them. And in the sort of war that he envisaged, the Branch\u0027s secrecy would be of the utmost importance, indeed Cosmic. \u0027On Sunside,\u0027 Lardis said, \u0027oh, not all that long ago, the Szgany fought the Wamphyri with whatever weapons were to hand. Here your weapons are far super - er, superior! And not only your guns, grenades, and flame-throwers. No, for it seems to me that you\u0027re using trreir own tactics against them, too.\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 Jake queried, walking beside him. \u0027Disguises, smokescreens, visual lies - like that vehicle there. Beer? No such thing. A deadly weapons system! Or if not a weapon itself, a system capable of directing and controlling weapons. Ben has told me that in Earth\u0027s past the vampires had a saying, that: \"Longevity is synon - er, synonymous, yes? - with anon - er, anonym - er ...\"\u0027\u0027Anonymity/ said Jake, and knew it for a certainty, without knowing how he knew.\u0027Yes!\u0027 Lardis nodded his grizzled, bandaged head. \u0027And in E-Branch they have another saying: that secrecy is synonymous - hah! - with survival. Pretty much the same, wouldn\u0027t you say?\u0027\u0027Pretty much,\u0027 said Jake. \u0027But vampires are one thing and I\u0027m another. And frankly, I\u0027ve had it with all the secrecy. If I\u0027m so important to the Branch, why can\u0027t I be told about it?\u0027\u0027At first it was because you might be less - or other - than you seemed,\u0027 Lardis told him. \u0027Now it\u0027s because you might be more. And also because you mightn\u0027t like what you are - if you are. Confusing? Well, not only for you, believe me! Anyway, regardless of what Liz says, it\u0027s not my job to tell you about you but about me and mine and the way things were, and the way they could be again by now, on Sunside/Starside.\u0027Around the camp, goodbyes were being said, hands shaken, the Australian contingent making ready to move out. Soon there would be just the Ops truck, with its array of worldwide communications devices, one jet-copter, and another on its way back from Carnarvon. The two choppers were transport for Branch personnel and SAS commanders; the Ops truck would stay until they were airborne, when it too would move out. In their next location, Trask\u0027s team of espers and support staff would be on their own until their Aussie back-up teams caught up with them. Thus these farewells were temporary; the same parties would soon be meeting up again, next time on the far side of the continent.This was something that puzzled Jake. \u0027How come we don\u0027t move as a complete unit? Trask has all the contacts; why can\u0027t he order up one of those big military transport choppers? Better still, why doesn\u0027t he just call on ahead and arrange for a new righting force to be waiting for us?\u0027\u0027He could probably do any or all of those things/ Lardis answered, \u0027but how would it look if we all arrived together at our next camp? Wouldn\u0027t you consider that indis - er, indisc - er, indiscreet, Jake? Remember, it\u0027s no easy thing for a man or men to hide their intentions from the Wamphyri. Any event unusual enough to arouse the interest of ordinary citizens is bound to arouse theirs, too.\u0027\u0027Like a sudden influx of specialist troops?\u0027 said Jake. \u0027Indeed,\u0027 said Lardis, with a nod. \u0027And as for starting out fresh with a brand new platoon of soldiers... but doesn\u0027t that go against the very first rule? The fewer people who know about us - \u0027 \u0027The longer we survive/ said Jake.\u0027Hah!\u0027said Lardis. \u0027Finally we make progress. And the problem with Mrs Miller becomes that much clearer, too.\u0027The first vehicles were pulling out now, and the Old Lidesci grunted his approval. \u0027This I like/ he said. \u0027It\u0027s what the Traveller is all about: constant movement between one place and the next. On Sunside, we Szgany became Travellers to stay ahead of the Wamphyri; we rarely stood still for very long in any one place. But here? Here we are the hunters. We move to track them down, and then we kill the bastards! Oh, yes, I like it a lot.\" He smacked his lips.The pair had arrived at the place of last night\u0027s campfire. The back-burner, stoves and oven were gone, but a steaming pot of coffee and a few paper cups had been left beside the trench. And as these very different men from entirely different worlds sat down on the last of the folding chairs, Jake said, \u0027Lardis, why don\u0027t you tell me about Sunside/Starside? I mean, all about Sunside/Starside, or as much as I can take in. For since that\u0027s where all this seems to have started, maybe it\u0027s my best starting place, too/ And Lardis said, \u0027As you will. But I may as well tell you now, it still won\u0027t answer your one big question/ \u0027I had a feeling it wouldn\u0027t/ Jake grunted. \u0027But tell me anyway/ And in a low growly voice, in words that strove valiantly to accommodate Jake\u0027s language - and when they failed reverted to Lardis\u0027s native Szgany, which the listener took in as best he could - the Old Lidesci complied ... \u0027As its name suggests, though in more senses than one, Sunside/ Starside is a divided world. On Sunside, a slow and benevolent sun spins out days to more than four times the length of Earth days. But it sits low in the sky and casts long shadows - the shadows of the barrier mountains - on Starside. And the gloom and the long nights of Starside must have been the greatest of aids in the evol - er, the evolution, yes, of the Wamphyri.\u0027We don\u0027t know how it started; it happened in a time lost to memory except in myths and legends, campfire stories carried down - and altered, of course - by word of mouth. But before the Wamphyri there was something of a young civilization, in a world much like this world, with oceans and mountains, islands and continents, and even seasons. And its peoples were setting out to explore it, just as your first sailors explored yours.\u0027Then, an accident. Not of Man but of Nature. A white sun fell from the sky. Ben Trask will tell you it was some kind of \"singularity\" ... but that is science, of which I know very little. Anyway, it bounced over the world like a flat stone skipping on water. In one place where it bounced, the impact caused its outer shell to break in pieces which fell to earth in such numbers they couldn\u0027t be counted. According to Nathan Keogh - called Kiklu upon a time - the land there became hot; chemicals in the soil gathered into pools; acids ate the white sun\u0027s metal skin into rust. Thus a \"Great Red Waste\" came into being, which today lies east of the barrier mountains.\u0027But the core of the white sun made a final leap. Shrinking, it sped west and slightly north; and such was its lure or fascination - its incredible \"gravity?\" - that even as it fell to earth it drew up from the earth those mountains that formed the barrier range.\u0027I\u0027ve probably made light of this; it should be said that the entire planet was in shock, convulsion. Lightnings crashed, the earth shook and broke open, and oceans stood on end, hurling themselves upon the land. From a benign world, the planet was changed to a nightmare. Entire races were wiped out, vanishing forever in the tumult of earth and fire, wind and water. It can\u0027t be known for a fact, but Trask\u0027s science has created a model for such a disaster which calculates that ninety-five out of every hundred human beings on my homeworld were killed in that historic upheaval! The seasons were no more; even our world\u0027s orbit around its sun was changed, again by the \"gravity\" of the white sun, which had not destroyed itself but come to rest in a crater on Starside. The barrier mountains reared where none had reared before, and north of the mountains grim and pitiless lands of ice shone dark blue under writhing auroras. It was as if a hell had descended from the sky, and the Szgany - those of my race who remained - were its denizens.\u0027But they weren\u0027t its only denizens ... \u0027At first, there were no Wamphyri. But there were always other peoples. The Szgany had avoided other races; they deemed them strange and called them un-men. Among these others, survivors of a northern clan of troglodytes now settled in caverns in the lee of Starside. Un-men from warmer southern climes, secretive desert folk known as the Thyre, became inhabitants of the burning regions south of Sunside\u0027s fertile green belt. It is even said that a race of cannibals - necromancers who tortured and ate the dead - existed and perhaps still exist in a remote far eastern country beyond the Great Red Waste, the mountains, and all other places known to the Szgany. Of these latter: I have never seen one, and do not wish to. \u0027But all of this resettling, and all of the planet\u0027s gradual recovery, took years and centuries and even millennia. Trask has said that it must have seemed like \"an endless nuclear winter.\" Well, to the people of the time, I suppose it was. But it did end eventually. And then there were no seasons, or only the very smallest climatic changes; and the green belt close to the barrier mountains was the only land in all of Sunside that could support the Szgany tribes, who slowly but surely began to multiply and forage in the forests.\u0027On Starside, where a great pass splits the mountainous divide, there in its crater resting-place at the fringe of the barren boulder plains the white sun sat like a blind eye deep in its socket, shining its white light up into the night like a beacon, or perhaps a warning? It was like ... like a door, or a gateway to the unknown! For if a man should climb down to touch that blinding light... ah, be sure he would not come up again! And because it had brought hell to the Szgany, it became known as the Hell-Lands Gate, aye.\u0027From then on, hunters and wanderers in the heights of the barrier mountains would look down on Starside and see the light of the Hell-Lands Gate, and they would curse it by their stars, and turn their faces away. And the faces of all the Szgany were turned away from Starside and its Gate.\u0027But then, who would be interested in exploring Starside? What was Starside but barren and endless boulder plains reaching north, and towering stone pinnacles - stacks, or \"buttes,\" as Trask calls them - reaching thousands of feet into the sky, and to the north the frozen oceans, and beyond the oceans the Icelands with their eerie auroras? No fit habitation for men, my friend, where the sun shone only on the topmost spires, and the cold was a knife in your bones. I have been to the foot of one of those great fangs ... that far but no further. And now, thanks to Harry and his sons, there are no aeries as such ... \u0027But it appears I\u0027ve gone ahead of myself. Best if I slow down. I was speaking of the past, and this is how it was: \u0027Came the vampires. Ask me how, I can only shake my head. Today, no man knows. None living, anyway. We know their spores were born in the swamps west of the farthest reach of the barrier mountains, and Nathan Keogh has spoken of similar swamps in the east. Very well then, that\u0027s where they came from, but how did they get there? Ben Trask has a theory - his people, these E-Branch people, have theories for most things - which has it that they were released into my world\u0027s skies out of the debris of the white sun: an alien life form from the stars. Perhaps it is so, but I am not a scientist.\u0027Anyway, and however it was, they came. Legend has it that Shaitan was the first. Because he couldn\u0027t bear the sun, he co-habited with trogs in the gloom of Starside caverns. But he was more like unto a man, and he wondered about the Szgany, of whom the trogs had told him. Finally, when he grew weary of the company and the blood of trogs, he came in the night into Sunside. And the curse of the vampire - Shaitan\u0027s mark, his vices - was left on all the tribes of the Szgany for all time to come.\u0027There\u0027s that of Shaitan in all of us, and I think in all of your people, too, especially the espers - but mercifully it amounts to very little. Watered down by time and blood, we see it only in these rare talents that Ben Trask collects and uses against the forces of evil. In him it\u0027s his ability to see the truth and therefore to recognize falseness; in Goodly it\u0027s his visions of the future, and in me it\u0027s my seer\u0027s blood, warning me of dangers whose scent is blown on the air, felt in. running waters, and glimpsed in the leaping flame of fires or patterns in the dust. When all is not well, I feel it. And in you - \u0027In you it is something else ... \u0027But once again I\u0027ve strayed.\u0027In Sunside Shaitan recruited thralls. But the sun was too strong for him and his; they retreated into Starside. And there he built the first aerie of the Wamphyri, in those great stacks out on the boulder plains. \u0027And the Great Vampire begat other vampires out of Sunside women and even out of trogs, and he raided on Sunside for blood and plunder. And while the Wamphyri prospered, the Szgany suffered every conceivable torment. \u0027Fortunately the Szgany had been nomadic, Travelling folk164 for long and long before the advent of the Wamphyri. Since land was their only possession, they had to beat the bounds to protect it and lay claim to ownership. And so they were rarely at rest. Just as well, for their mobility was their survival. They could run and they could breed and they could hide, but that was all. And at night the vampire would ride his flyers out of Starside to hunt and to \"play\" in Sunside\u0027s darkened forests. And everything that the Szgany are today is built out of the incredible, the despicable depredations of the Wamphyri. \u0027The Szgany learned to hide, not only their trembling bodies but their very thoughts. Why, eventually they even learned how to fight back! But that was a long time in the coming. And as evolution taught the Szgany its lessons of survival, so the vampire - by nature lazy - found it increasingly difficult to take his prey. And then, from time to time, vampire would turn upon vampire, and all Starside become a battle zone.\u0027The wars of the WTamphyri, their bloodwars, were endless, and except when truces were called they were times of rejoicing for the Szgany clans. But gutted aeries would always need replenishing, and depleted larders filling, and fallen flyers and broken warrior creatures refashioning in their morbid masters\u0027 vats of metamorphosis. And however long it took, the Wamphyri would return to Sunside, its pleasures and plunders.\u0027The Szgany Lidesci were the fiercest fighters of all. I make no boast, though naturally I\u0027m proud, but merely state a fact when I say that my fathers\u0027 fathers - the forefathers of the Szgany Lidesci - were the first of the Travellers to lay traps for the Wamphyri, their lieutenants, thralls and creatures. We were staking, beheading, and burning those bastards a hundred years ago! Aye, even before The Dweller and Harry Hell-Lander took up our fight and showed those monsters what a real war looked like, the Lidescis had the respect of the Wamphyri ... along with their hatred, of course.\u0027I was Chief of the Szgany Lidesci when The Dweller came, and later Zekintha, and later still Jazz Simmons. And finally165Harry Hell-Lander, called Dwellersire. But Harry and his sons, The Dweller and Nathan Keogh, they all moved as you move, Jake ... between the spaces used by common men, along a route invisible. Nathan Keogh still does, but in Sunside, in my world, on the far side of space-time; or one of its far sides, at least. Which is Ben Trask speaking, you understand. Me? Hah! I don\u0027t even know where space-time is!\u0027Anyway, I was Chief when Harry and his boy fought their battle in The Dweller\u0027s garden - their grand battle with the Wamphyri - and won! I couldn\u0027t be there with them, more\u0027s the pity, couldn\u0027t stand alongside Zek, and Jazz Simmons, and the Lady Karen, too; no, for I had problems of my own and arrived too late. But with these very eyes I saw what they had done: how they\u0027d used the science of another world, the Hell-Lands, and weird talents from ... well, from beyond any lands of the living, to defeat the forces of Lord Shaithis of the Wamphyri and kick his backside into the Icelands.\u0027We thought that was the end of it. All of the aeries bar one, Karen\u0027s, had been burned out, toppled, and brought crashing down onto the boulder plains. Why, the thunder of it - the shaking of the earth - had been felt in Sunside itself! Well, perhaps not as far away as that, but you get the idea. It had been awesome. And as I have said, we thought that was the end of it, that finally the Wamphyri were no more.\u0027Most of my people thought so, anyway...\u0027But I have a seer\u0027s blood in me - perhaps even vampire blood ... oh, it\u0027s possible! - and I didn\u0027t believe that the Wamphyri were no more. It simply didn\u0027t smell right, it didn\u0027t feel right, and for a time equal to four of your Earth years I couldn\u0027t settle but watched and waited and held my breath. And from time to time I would climb up into the barrier mountains, through the high crags and passes, and down into The Dweller\u0027s garden, all fallen into ruin, where I would sit alone to think it over ... and to worry. \u0027And not without good reason. One time when I went there, Harry came back. But he was changed. No, don\u0027t ask my meaning; he simply wasn\u0027t the man I\u0027d known. But I believe he was soil my friend. And the Necroscope had chosen a most opportune time to return to my world, for my seer\u0027s blood had told me no lie: the Wamphyri were back in Sunside/Starside! Not only the last of them, but also the first.\u0027Shaitan the Unborn himself, aye, come back like a plague thatcan never die ...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-12.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire. He\u0027s got to start thinking about the future--or he won\u0027t have one!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:57 PM"}}
