{"id":97204,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Gadgets And GhostsThe decontamination booths reminded Jake of those antique telephone kiosks so treasured by collectors. They weren\u0027t red and didn\u0027t have those small glass panes for windows, but they were much the same size and even smelled bad. Not of urine, no, but garlic; Jake couldn\u0027t make up his mind which was more nauseous.\n Situated in the back of the rearmost articulated trailer section, and fitted with doors as small as the toilet doors on an airplane, there were three booths on each side. Inside each booth was a disposal unit for soiled clothing; discarded items were sucked away, irradiated and microwaved, spat from an exterior chute and burned. The procedure covered all clothing. Which meant you were left buck-naked in the waterproof and airtight booth, where the rest of the process was entirely automatic. And that was when you discovered why these claustrophobic little shower-units - for that\u0027s what they were - smelled so foul. At first it was just hot water, stinging like BB shot where it blasted down on you from overhead jets, but in a few seconds it was something else: a mixture of something chemical and antiseptic, and something vegetable and oily. The chemical saturated and then evaporated, but the oil stayed. And - damn it to hell! - you were supposed to rub it into your pores. But if there was one thing Jake especially hated, it was garlic!\n There was an intercom system; you could talk to people in the ops section, or to other agents undergoing decontamination in the booths, whichever. Also, the uppermost sections of the booths were glass-panelled on the sides from the neck up, and from there down stainless steel. This last was simply a matter of common decency; there were female as well as male agents.Jake had chosen a central booth and Liz had taken the one to his left. Switching on her booth intercom, she said, \u0027I see you picked the middle one. You could have taken the one on the end, so there\u0027d at least be a booth between us!\u0027 Looking sexy as hell (for all that Jake could only see her face, her long slender neck and shoulders), she pulled an impish face at him through the glass.But he only grinned - a rare occurrence in itself where Jake Cutter was concerned - and answered, \u0027Oh, really? And why didn\u0027t you choose one on the other side of the vehicle, so you wouldn\u0027t have to be near me at all?\u0027 Then on the spur of the moment he leaned forward, flattened his hawk nose to the glass panel, and made as if to look down inside her booth. There was no way; the glass was misted at the edges and it was all gleam, steam, and cream down there. \u0027Oblige me and stand on your toes, will you?\u0027 he grunted - and was so astonished at himself that he bit his tongue - and was equally amazed at Liz when, for a single instant of time, she actually seemed to consider doing it!It was the look on her face: a not-quite innocence, a curiosity, a magnetism that worked both ways. She looked beautiful like that: hair plastered down, make-up all washed away, and her skin shiny with oil - yet still beautiful. Jake was drawn by it - and repulsed. There was something he\u0027d vowed to himself, and he would stick by it to the end, until it was done. And anyway, Liz didn\u0027t stand on her toes but simply blushed. Or maybe that was as a result of the steam. In which case it would be hiding his colour, too ... thank the Lord!\n \u0027Anyway, what are you doing here?\u0027 she said. And maybe it was his imagination, but her voice sounded just a little husky.\n Must be the intercom. \u0027I mean, you\u0027ve made it amply clear that you don\u0027t want to be with us. So why are you?\u0027Jake glanced at the intercom panel. Liz\u0027s button was the only one that was lit up. No one else was listening, so their conversation would be completely private. That was assuming he wanted to talk, of course. And suddenly he did. \u0027I didn\u0027t have any choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027I could be here or I could be locked up. Well, I\u0027ve been in jail, and here is better. But after tonight, I can tell you it\u0027s not much better ...\u0027 There he stopped short, reconsidered. Why bother? Why try to get close to anyone? He\u0027d been close to someone before, and she\u0027d paid for it. Once was enough.\u0027They ... they jailed you for murder?\u0027 Liz said, and her face was very serious now. \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027ve heard, anyway.\u0027\u0027I killed some people,\u0027 Jake nodded. \u0027And if I get half a chance there are still two more who I want to kill.\u0027 He admitted it oh so matter-of-factly, and for a moment his brown eyes were very nearly black; they were bleak, too, almost vacant in their intensity. Liz felt that Jake\u0027s eyes looked at something a thousand miles away, perhaps a scene from memory, his as yet undisclosed past. Or maybe it was just an effect of the misted glass.But then he smiled, however wanly, and was animate again. \u0027So, there you go. That\u0027s me, Mr Bad Man. So what\u0027s your story, Liz? What\u0027s a nice girl like you doing in a freaky outfit like this?\u0027She felt cheated, because she knew he hadn\u0027t told it all. Not nearly. \u0027Tell me just one more thing,\u0027 she said, shivering because the spray was cooler now, and also because of the look she\u0027d seen in his eyes. \u0027About you, or about those men you say you killed. Did they deserve it?\u0027He looked at her, then answered her with a question of his own. \u0027What about those creatures tonight: did they deserve it?\u0027\u0027But they were vampires, monsters!\u0027He simply nodded, left it for her to figure out...\n By which time the spray had become shampoo, and they knew it was nearly over, this part of it, anyway. As he soaped himself down Jake reminded her, \u0027I\u0027m waiting.\u0027 Despite his doubts, his resolve, still his interest couldn\u0027t be denied.\n \u0027Hmm?\u0027 she said. Then: \u0027Oh! Why am I here? That\u0027s easy. I was doing some work for a psychic-research group. Looking back, I suspect it was an E-Branch recruiting ploy. They haven\u0027t said as much, not yet, but I gather they\u0027re pretty hush-hush until a person is well-established with them. Anyway, the job was easy, the money was good and I needed the work. My office was in central London; I interviewed people, allegedly for Mind Magazine, and if they responded positively to a certain set of questions, then I was supposed to work with them and carry out a series of tests.\u0027 She shrugged, and through the misted glass Jake saw her shoulders give a little twitch, the suggestive movement of hero oounderarm flesh as the weight of her ample breasts settled.\u0027Anyway,\u0027 she went on, \u0027I used an old German Prismaton-70 in the tests, and - \u0027\u0027A what?\u0027 Jake cut her off.\u0027It\u0027s a machine that chooses psi symbols at random.\u0027\u0027Psi symbols?\u0027Liz sighed. \u0027Five designs: a star, a circle, a square, a plus sign, and wavy lines.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m with you now,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027The machine picks the symbol, and the test subject has to guess which one it is.\u0027\u0027Except it\u0027s not supposed to be a guess,\u0027 Liz told him. \u0027I mean, they\u0027re supposed to concentrate and try to know what symbol it is! That\u0027s what ESP is all about.\u0027\u0027Go on.\u0027\u0027Well, at first I would get a few lucky guessers ... they might come up with two or three correct symbols in a row and I would get all excited. But in the long run it never worked out to anything, and I\u0027d be disappointed because, you know, I wanted to earn my money. But for me to be successful, obviously my test subjects had to be successful, too. And so I found myself willing them to get it right. Someone would say, \"Square!\" And I would be telling myself, \"No, no, no! That\u0027s wrong! It\u0027s the wavy lines!\"57Until I reached the stage when I was saying, \"No, that\u0027s wrong,\" or, if someone got lucky, \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" before they named their choice, before they even spoke!\u0027\u0027Let me guess,\u0027 said Jake. \u0027You didn\u0027t know what was going on. You thought that either you were mistaken, or the machine - the, er, Prismaton-70? - was playing tricks with you, or - \u0027\u0027But it couldn\u0027t be the machine,\u0027 Liz cut him short, \u0027because it\u0027s only a machine/\u0027 - Or that you yourself/ Jake went on, \u0027must somehow be \"in tune\" with your subjects. Mental telepathy, right?\u0027She nodded. \u0027It was me. It wasn\u0027t that my subjects, an incredibly high percentage of them, were good at sending - which is E-Branch parlance for telepathic transmissions - but that / was good at receiving. I was a receiver, a mind-reader. I could \"tune in\" to other people\u0027s thoughts, yes. Not all the time and not without a lot of effort and concentration, but sometimes/\u0027Which was something you\u0027d never noticed before?\u0027 Despite the events of the night - the fact that he\u0027d observed for himself her obvious effect on Trennier - still Jake was a little sceptical. \u0027I mean, that you knew what people were thinking?\u0027She grinned. \u0027Well, I frequently knew what men were thinking ....\" Slowly her grin disappeared. \u0027No, seriously, I hadn\u0027t the foggiest idea. But as soon as I did know, then it was like Topsy/ \u0027It just growed and growed .. / Jake thought it over. \u0027And then there\u0027s you/ Liz said pointedly. But he wasn\u0027t having any and simply looked away.\n The pungent soap had stopped and it was plain water now, and cold. Just as they might have started complaining, the system closed itself down and a light began flashing on the intercom. It was Trask, wanting to know, \u0027Are you people done? Good.\u0027 So get out of there and make room for someone else/ The rest of the team, all of them, would go through a less intensive cycle. But Jake and Liz weren\u0027t finished yet.\n Dry towelling robes dispensed themselves from compartments in the rear of the booths, with plastic-bag \u0027bootees\u0027 for their feet. Then the doors concertinaed of their own accord, and outside in the corridor other agents were coming aboard and making ready. But Jake and Liz stayed apart from them and went on into the body of the ops vehicle and the next stage, where Trask himself administered hypodermic injections while the old man, Lardis Lidesci, stood watching. Until finally they were obliged to drink something vile.\n \u0027God!\u0027 Jake gasped, clutching his throat. And again: \u0027God, but if I\u0027m not going to be sick as a dog ...!\u0027\u0027If you are,\u0027said the Old Lidesci, Til take it as a very bad sign/ And Trask grinned, however coldly, as Lardis fondled the grip of his machete.\u0027He won\u0027t be sick/ Trask said then. \u0027And even if he is it won\u0027t mean anything. I remember I was sick myself, desperately, the first time I tasted that stuff/\u0027Garlic?\u0027 Still Jake felt like gagging.\u0027Derived from/ Trask shrugged. \u0027Anyway, it\u0027s good for you ... or so I\u0027m told/ Turning, he led the way down the corridor, past doors to a half-dozen cramped bunks, and through a telescopic conduit and hatch into the vehicle\u0027s forward trailer section. Then at last they were there: in the ops room itself, the mobile nerve-centre ...lan Goodly was in the hollow oval that formed the central desk. He swung round the oval on a tracked chair, studying the various illuminated wall-charts and monitor screens. The place was hi-tec heaven, well in advance even of anything else that AD 2011 had to offer. In complete contrast to the articulated shell of truck and trailers - indeed, utterly contradicting that outer facade, with its mundane and easily identifiable \u0027Castlemaine\u0027 and \u0027XXXX\u0027 legends - this interior was something out of speculative fiction. And never a can of beer in sight.Goodly was wearing what looked like a virtual reality headset that was constantly tuning itself to whatever event or location he was observing. But as he swung into a new position and Trask and company came between the precog and the ever-changing screens, so Goodly brought his chair to a halt and took off the headset.The Old Lidesci shook his grizzled head in astonishment and grunted, \u0027After two years of working with you people, I\u0027m still not used to it.\u0027 Not used to ... to this.\u0027Trask nodded his understanding. 7 know what you mean/ he said, \u0027but you won\u0027t get too much sympathy from me. Hell, it\u0027s been more than thirty years for me - and I still feel the same about it/ What was it Alec Kyle used to say? How did he put it? Or was it Darcy Clarke?\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027But what difference does it make, eh? It could have been any one of us. \"Robots and romantics. Super-science and the supernatural. Telemetry and telepathy. Computerized probability patterns and precognition. Huh! Gadgets and ghosts.\u0027\" Well, that\u0027s it. That\u0027s E-Branch/But Jake wanted to know: \u0027Just what is E-Branch? What\u0027s it all about? Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time we saw the whole picture?\u0027 He glanced at Liz. \u0027Well, me at least... especially after what you threw me into tonight?\u0027\u0027Threw us into,\u0027 said Liz. \u0027I\u0027m not as much in the dark as you, Jake, but it\u0027s still pretty murky around here.\u0027 She looked at Trask, perhaps accusingly. \u0027And after all, while tonight was one of the first things we\u0027ve done, it might also have been the last.\u0027But lan Goodly shook his head. \u0027No/ he said. \u0027You have a way to go yet, you two/\u0027Precog/ Jake said, sourly. \u0027That\u0027s how I\u0027ve heard people refer to you. But how can you possibly know for sure?\u0027And Trask said, \u0027Because he hasn\u0027t let us down yet/\u0027And what if tonight had been the first time?\u0027 Jake wasn\u0027t convinced.\n But Trask only raised a white eyebrow. \u0027So what\u0027s your big problem, Jake? Are you trying to kid us you haven\u0027t been doing your best to get yourself killed these last three years?\u0027\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 Jake snapped. \u0027But on my terms!\u0027\n \u0027Well now it\u0027s on my terms/ Trask growled. \u0027Or E-Branch\u0027s terms/ Then he relaxed a little, looked less severe, and said, \u0027Okay, I\u0027ll tell you. It was a test. Oh, it served its purpose, too, but it was nevertheless a test. And you both passed it. We saw enough tonight - enough happened - to convince us we were right/\n \u0027About me?\u0027 Jake said.\u0027About both of you/ Trask replied. \u0027Liz did her thing, and we all saw Trennier\u0027s reply. She sent and he received - and he reacted!\u0027\u0027Did he ever!\u0027 said Liz with a shudder. \u0027But you\u0027re the one who told me to taunt him/\n Trask nodded and said, \u0027And you made a damn good job of it, too, and satisfied our best expectations. So, if you still want in, welcome to the club. You\u0027re one of us. And having seen what you\u0027ve seen - even with what little we\u0027ve allowed you to learn - we\u0027ve no doubt but that you\u0027ll join us. So that\u0027s that. And in any case you have time to think about it/\n \u0027And do I have time to think about it, too?\u0027 Jake said testily. \u0027If so you can have my answer right now. It\u0027s no, I\u0027m out/\n Trask frowned, narrowed his eyes, and said, \u0027Well, that\u0027s a damn shame because you don\u0027t have a choice. And that\u0027s because you, too, did your thing tonight. Something I haven\u0027t seen the likes of in, oh, five years. And when I did last see it ... it was in another world, a vampire world, Lardis\u0027s world/\n Jake looked at the three men in turn - Trask, Goodly, Lardis Lidesci, the way they looked back at him: sincere, serious, speculative? - and shook his head in mock despair. \u0027I\u0027ve been telling myself that it\u0027s all a dream, one from which I\u0027ll soon be waking up/ he said. Then his voice hardened. \u0027But it isn\u0027t and I won\u0027t - not from any dream of mine, anyway. This is your dream, your fucking nightmare, and I\u0027ve had it up to here!\u0027\u0027Oh no, this is everyone\u0027s nightmare/ Trask told him, and then pressed on: \u0027But which part do you think is a dream,\n Jake? The strange work we do, or the fantastic thing that you do?\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t do anything!\u0027 Jake turned on him, and for a moment looked like he might hit him. \u0027It just ... it just happens.\u0027 He clenched his fists, unclenched them, stood lost for words.Trask shook his head. \u0027But things don\u0027t \"just happen\", Jake,\u0027 he said. \u0027They happen for reasons. And we\u0027ve got to figure out why they\u0027re happening to you.\u0027 He turned to lan Goodly. \u0027Do we have his file?\u0027The precog nodded, swung his chair to a filing cabinet set in a section of the oval desk, took out a slim folder and handed it over.There were chairs that folded into the walls. Trask let one down, sat in it, and invited the others to do the same. Then he opened the file. And:\u0027Jake Cutter ...\u0027 he began. But Jake\u0027s voice was harsh as he interrupted:\u0027Do you intend to to read it all? Even the nasty bits? With a woman present?\u0027 The others had taken chairs, but he was still standing.\u0027Brief details,\u0027 Trask said, staring up at him. \u0027Why do you ask? Is there something you\u0027re ashamed of?\u0027\u0027What has that got to do with it?\u0027 Jake blurted. \u0027That\u0027s my life you\u0027re holding in your hands. It\u0027s private - or it used to be.\u0027\u0027The newspapers didn\u0027t think so.\u0027 Trask didn\u0027t even blink.\u0027Hell, no, they didn\u0027t!\u0027 Jake said. \u0027They held me one hundred per cent responsible for my \"crimes!\" And do you intend to detail those, too? Is this how you\u0027re going to keep me in line, working for you, for E-Branch: by holding a bloody axe over my head every time I voice an opinion or refuse to cooperate?\u0027\n Trask shook his head. \u0027That has nothing to do with it. The object of the exercise is to get to the root of your talent. As for your so-called \"crimes\" ... it\u0027s the opinion of this Branch that you don\u0027t have too much to be ashamed of.\u0027\n For a moment Jake was taken aback, but then he said, \u0027What if I don\u0027t much care about the opinion of this Branch?\u0027\n \u0027But you do,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027You believe in justice, and you couldn\u0027t get any. So you provided your own rough justice, which was just a little too rough for our modern society. In E-Branch, Jake, we understand rough justice. It\u0027s sometimes the only kind that will fit. And we were taught by an expert, someone who believed in an eye for an eye almost as much as you do. Well, now we wonder if that\u0027s all you have in common with him, or if this talent of yours is something else. And what\u0027s more, there might even be other talents. We want to explore that possibility, too - indeed, every possibility - and you can help us or hinder us. In which case ... eventually we\u0027d be obliged to give up on you. And there\u0027s still an empty cell waiting for you, remember?\u0027\n Jake\u0027s hard-frozen shell was coming apart now. Not his resolve but the icy sheath that covered it, without which he wouldn\u0027t have been able to face his own atrocities. For that was how he secretly viewed some of his past deeds, as atrocities. Everyone else had seemed to think so, anyway. Yet in his heart, still Jake believed that what Ben Trask had said was right: sometimes an eye for an eye was the only way. And suddenly Jake found himself believing everything else that Trask was telling him, that E-Branch really did care and was on his side. It was just that it had been such a long time since anyone was on his side.And now Trask was saying, \u0027So can we get on?\u0027Jake drew a chair out from the wall, sat down heavily and said, \u0027Why do I get this feeling this isn\u0027t a con? You\u0027re what they call a human lie-detector, right? Well, Mr Trask, if you ask me, I\u0027d say your talent works both ways! I get the impression that you really do want to help me, even if it\u0027s only so I can help you ...\u0027Trask actually smiled then, and said, \u0027Jake, you\u0027re exactly right. I hate all lies and liars, and I instinctively know when something isn\u0027t true, isn\u0027t right. Don\u0027t ask me how, I just do.\n But it\u0027s equally hard for me to tell a lie as to listen to one. I just thought you might like to know that.\u0027Jake nodded and, feeling a little more in control now, said, \u0027Okay, so if you think there\u0027s ... something wrong with me and you can maybe fix it, I suppose I\u0027d be a fool to object.\u0027Trask sat back and issued an audible sigh. \u0027Very well. But you have to understand. It\u0027s not that we think there\u0027s anything wrong with you, but that something may be right. From our point of view, anyway.\u0027And then he returned to the file ...\n \u0027Your father was a USAF pilot,\u0027 Trask began. \u0027As a rookie, Joe Cutter served at an American airbase in southern England. That was where he met your mother, an English girl from a well-to-do family. Janet Carson\u0027s folks objected; they got married anyway; for a while Janet was a camp follower, living wherever Joe was based. Then you came along, doing your bit to stabilize a frequently stormy relationship ... well, for a little while, anyway.\n But the marriage didn\u0027t last. Your father was too often away, and your mother ... took lovers.\u0027 Trask lifted his gaze from the file, looked at Jake. \u0027If this is too personal I can skip forward ... \u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re doing okay/ Jake shrugged. \u0027Since my parents left me nothing in the way of great memories, what does it matter?\u0027And so Trask continued. \u0027Your mother had friends in what\u0027s called \"high society.\" Eventually she married a French businessman, with whom she lived in St Tropez, until ... well, until she died five years ago.\u0027Again Jake\u0027s shrug, though not as careless as he might have tried to make it seem. \u0027It\u0027s nice in Nice,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027So as a baby you went to your British grandparents,\u0027 Trask went on, \u0027who were maybe a little on the wrong side of fifty to take on your upringing. As for your father: Joe Cutter died on aerial manoeuvres in Germany in 1995, piloting a way beyond its sell-by-date airplane known \"affectionately\" to its pilots as a \"Flying Coffin.\" Joe was coming to the end of his service when it happened, and you were just fifteen years old ...\n \u0027You were an unruly kid, Jake. Too much money, courtesy of your then aging and indeed doting grandparents, too many opportunities to smoke \"funny\" cigarettes, and probably to try other \"controlled\" pharmaceuticals? Too much time on your hands, and nothing much to look forward to, not to your way of thinking at least. So you dropped out of school, spent some time with your mother in France; but she had quite a few bad habits of her own and wasn\u0027t a very good influence. And anyway, you didn\u0027t get on with her. You said you might join the Army and your grandfather was delighted. He said, \"Excellent! The Brigade of Guards! The old school tie and all that, wot? Wot?\" So you joined the Parachute Regiment because you wanted to jump out of airplanes! And in just two years you transferred to the SAS. Well, so much for parental guidance.\u0027When they kicked you out of the SAS your final report said you were incapable of taking orders. Also, and this is a damned strange thing for the SAS, the report said you were too much of a loner! This from an outfit that prides itself on self-dependence, or total independence! So there you were, five years ago: back to the good life, a life of luxury in the South of France, where you lived off your Ma\u0027s money.\u0027Jake shrugged, but he looked more than a little uncomfortable. \u0027Her second husband left her a packet,\u0027 he said. \u0027And her third was even richer. So why should I break my back working?\u0027\u0027I\u0027m not criticizing you, Jake,\u0027 Trask told him. Tm just pointing out what you were then, in order to find a comparison with what you later became in the eyes of society. Which is to say a criminal. More than that, a brutal murderer.\u0027\u0027Now just you wait a minute!\u0027 Jake started to say, \u0027Didn\u0027t you tell me that you - \u0027 until Trask cut him off with:\u0027In the eyes of society, anyway. But society has been known to make the odd mistake here and there. And E-Branch ... well, we\u0027re sometimes called in to clean up the mess; though as often as not we just jump in feet first regardless. Very well, now we can get away from your story for a minute or so ...\u0027 And after a brief pause fie went on:\u0027For the last fifteen to twenty years - or even longer than that, indeed ever since the fall of Communism - Europe has been in one hell of a mess. Recessions, revolutions, coups one after the other; nuclear black spots where Russian power-stations and weapons dumps are left rotting down to so much atomic rubble; little wars, and not so little wars left, right, and centre as nations take their revenge, engage in racial vendettas that should have been settled, probably would have been settled, a hundred years ago if Soviet expansionism and Communism hadn\u0027t called a temporary halt to them. Power struggles in political systems that are still sorting themselves out, in Rome and Moscow and elsewhere; ethnic cleansing in and around the Slavic and Baltic countries, and regular revolutions in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania. Italian, French, and German governments coming and going as regular as the ticking of a clock, and lasting about the same length of time, never long enough to do anyone any good. And as for the Near and Middle East, Africa, the Orient .. / Trask sighed and shook his head. \u0027Have I painted a sufficiently gloomy picture?\u0027 And without waiting for an answer:\u0027Well, thank God we\u0027re an island - England, I mean - and also that we\u0027ve maintained and strengthened our ties with America and Australia. Because the rest of the world seems like no-man\u0027s-land. In a word, it\u0027s chaos.\u0027It seems an ideal scenario for the end of life as we know it, right? Even as I speak the depletion of the ozone layer continues, we\u0027re into yet another El Nifio - the fourth in fifteen years - and there\u0027s a rip-roaring plague spreading west out of an ideologically and financially exhausted China. But there are worse plagues than a new strain of the bubonic variety, believe me ...\u0027\n Again a brief pause, until: \u0027And so back to you,\u0027 Trask continued, staring at Jake.\n \u0027Your mother died of an overdose, left you some money - \u0027\n \u0027The money was about the only decent thing she ever did for me,\u0027 Jake nodded, his husky tone betraying his true emotions.\n \u0027 - But you and money together spelled more trouble.\u0027 Trask chose to ignore the interruption. \u0027So maybe you didn\u0027t have too much going for you, you and your Ma - still her death affected you badly. You went on a long drinking spree in all the Mediterranean resorts from Genoa to Marseille, wrecked your car on the Italian Riviera; the paparazzi took your photograph during several fist-fights in Cannes. Also it\u0027s not at all unlikely that you returned to your drug-taking habits.\u0027\u0027I never had much of a habit,\u0027 Jake told him. \u0027Oh, I tried just about every brand, that\u0027s true, but they only made me ill. Those \"funny\" cigarettes were about as bad as it ever got, and where I\u0027ve spent the last three months even they were far too expensive. I\u0027m used to my asshole the shape and size I\u0027ve always known it!\u0027 He looked at Liz and said, \u0027Sorry, but if you insist on being here ...\u0027She shook her head, answered, \u0027I\u0027m not a child, Jake. After tonight I thought you\u0027d know that much, at least.\u0027And Trask went on just as if no one else had spoken: \u0027Then you met a girl. There\u0027d been women in your life - quite a few - but this one was something else. She was special.\u0027\u0027This is the bit you can skip,\u0027 Jake told him gruffly. But:\u0027Unfortunately not,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027If Liz is to be your partner, and the rest of E-Branch is to work with you, they\u0027ll need to know that you aren\u0027t quite the savage that the world - and probably you, too, Jake - thinks you are. They\u0027ll need to know you had your reasons.\u0027And Jake sat silently now, his head lowered ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-5.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \n Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ.

He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \n If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \n But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry.
