{"id":97217,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"PART THREE\\n\\n The Start Of It\\n\\n CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\n\\n Second Thoughts, And Others Less MundaneNoticing Jake\u0027s distress, Liz had scrambled from her gunner\u0027s seat into the narrow cargo area, crouched down beside him, and was now hauling on the lapels of his jacket, roughing him up a little. \u0027Jake! Jake, wake up!\u0027 Then - as his eyes snapped open, startling her, and lightning reflexes and hands worked in combination to slap her wrists aside, then grab them - \u0027You were shouting,\u0027 she explained. \u0027And now you\u0027re hurting!\u0027He let go of her, dragged himself into an upright, seated position among the jumble of packs, and mumbled, \u0027What? Shouting?\u0027 Of course he had been shouting, because he\u0027d been nightmaring. But what about? Already the waking world, in the shape of Liz, was obliterating his dreams, consigning them to innermost recesses of his subconscious mind. But realizing something of their importance, Jake was reluctant to let them go. \u0027What was I shouting about?\u0027 he demanded harshly, but too late. For even as his head cleared the nightmare was retreating, shrinking to nothing.\\n\\n Then he looked about - at the piled packs, the chopper\u0027s interior, the faces of the men up front looking back at him - and remembered where he was. And as the fear went out of Jake\u0027s eyes it was replaced by a worried frown. His face was damp with sweat, despite that it wasn\u0027t any too warm in ... the aircraft? In the jet-copter, yes. His orientation was still a little off, making everything feel and sound unreal. Then it dawned on him that the hiss of the horizontal jets was absent, and the crisp chop! chop! chop! of rotors had taken over. They must be descending, into Alice Springs.\u0027I don\u0027t know what you were shouting about/ Liz answered him. \u0027Most of what you said was pure babble, until just before you woke up.\u0027 She went back to her seat and buckled herself in. \u0027Then you mentioned Szwart, Malinari, and Vavara. But you were doing a lot of twitching, too. It was a nightmare, Jake. A killer of a nightmare, I\u0027d say.\" A killer. Yes, she was right:A grotesque thing - Wamphyri! - its taloned hands reaching to snuff the life from an innocent baby boy. And:\u0027Yulian Bodescu!\u0027 Jake gasped aloud, starting as if he\u0027d been slapped in the face. \u0027Does anyone know who ... who Yulian Bodescu was?\u0027 But that final scene, too, was fading away, following the rest of the nightmare into limbo.In their seats up front, however, Ben Trask and lan Goodly exchanged secretive but mainly wondering glances and said nothing ... not until they were on the ground and they\u0027d stretched their legs and made their way to the lounge and the airport\u0027s watering hole ...Jake and Lardis sat at the almost empty bar, chewing nuts and nursing large beers; Liz, Trask, and Goodly had a small table, smaller drinks, and ate from a plate of sandwiches. Huge overhead fans did their best to stir the sluggish air and keep the atmosphere bearable. But even the local Aussies were sweating. It was that kind of summer. El Nifio, drying everything to kindling.\\n\\n Lardis smacked his lips in appreciation, sighed and told Jake: \u0027This has to be one of the few true benefits of your entire world.\u0027 And then, noticing how the bartender was giving him curious looks, he added, \u0027Er, of Australia, I mean. One of the true benefits of Australia. They certainly know how to brew a good beer, these Australians.\u0027\\n\\n The bartender looked Lardis up and down, and said, \u0027I saw that movie, too, me old mate, way back when I was a little kid. But it didn\u0027t influence me mode o\u0027 dress!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Lardis.\u0027Crocodile bleedin\u0027 Dundee!\u0027 The other shook his head and moved off along the bar. \u0027Jesus, what is it with you tourists? Do yer think we all live in the bleedin\u0027 outback?\u0027Lardis looked down at his clothes, lizard-skin belt, machete, shad-hide sandals, and scowled. \u0027Have I been insulted?\u0027 he wondered out loud.But Jake\u0027s thoughts were elsewhere. \u0027Lardis, tell me about Harry Keogh,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, I\u0027ve heard Trask talk about his compassion, warmth, and humility, which you have to admit makes him sound like a pacifist. But if he was so humble, how come he ended up as a - a what? A vampire-killer? And I gather it wasn\u0027t only vampires he killed.\u0027\u0027As for Harry Dwellersire\u0027s history in this world,\u0027 the Old Lidesci answered, having first made sure that the bartender was well out of earshot, \u0027I don\u0027t know the entire story. That\u0027s why I was only able to talk about Sunside/Starside. But from what I saw of him ... well, I wouldn\u0027t be too sure about Harry\u0027s \"humility,\" or his compassion either. After all, Nathan Kiklu was a humble one, too, upon a time. Anyway, I only met the Necroscope towards the end, which wasn\u0027t a pretty end ...\u0027Then, abruptly, Lardis\u0027s tone changed, and peering at Jake suspiciously he snapped, \u0027Now do me a favour and stop trying to wheedle things out of me, okay? What am I anyway but \"a bleedin\u0027 tourist\", eh?\u0027While at the table, also out of earshot, Goodly, Liz, and Trask were considering something else. \u0027Yulian Bodescu?\u0027 Trask looked at Liz. \u0027You\u0027re sure he said Yulian Bodescu? We thought so, too, but we were too far away to be sure. Now tell me, how in hell did he come up with that name? If he\u0027s read it or perhaps remembered it from something someone has said, why has it chosen to surface now, in a dream?\u0027\\n\\n Liz could only shrug and ask, \u0027Is it really that strange? I mean, it\u0027s hardly the most common of names, now is it? To be honest, it\u0027s just exactly the kind of name that would stick in my mind.\u0027But Trask was out of sorts with himself, and it showed. \u0027I put you in that gunner\u0027s bucket-seat, close to him, so that you could listen in on him/ he said. \u0027In E-Branch we know how important dreams can be. But you say you got nothing?\u0027\u0027To start with,\u0027 Liz\u0027s voice hardened as she began to flare up, i-r t j. \u003e I don t - But the precog quickly cautioned her: \u0027SW. Keep it down.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t understand why we can\u0027t tell Jake about the entire Bodescu affair.\" she continued in a lowered but emphatic tone. \u0027And what\u0027s more,\u0027 (looking at Trask) \u0027I didn\u0027t much like what you asked me to do. To start with, it\u0027s not E-Branch policy to spy on our colleagues, and - \u0027\u0027Don\u0027t go lecturing me about Branch policy - Miss!\u0027 Trask glared. \u0027As for Jake Cutter: he won\u0027t be a colleague until I\u0027m one hundred per cent sure he\u0027s on our side. The man vacillates, sits on the fence. I\u0027m not even sure he won\u0027t make a break for it the first chance he gets.\"\u0027 - And\u0027 Liz continued, determined to be heard, \u0027the last time I tried it he ... he knew.\u0027\u0027He what?\u0027 Goodly stared at her.\u0027Jake knew I was listening in on him/ Liz said, deflated now. \u0027He was dreaming - something sexy, erotic, yes, and frightening, too - and when I broke in on him it woke him up. So how can I ask him to trust me when he thinks I\u0027m constantly in his mind?\u0027\u0027So you didn\u0027t try?\u0027 Trask said.\u0027That\u0027s not so/ she shook her head. \u0027I did try, but I was blocked. I couldn\u0027t get in. Or I could, but it was like walking through a fog, all dismal and distorted. I didn\u0027t get one single clear picture.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Precisely what I didn\u0027t want to hear/ Trask grunted. \u0027So now I\u0027ll tell you why I\u0027m not ready to tell him the entire Yulian Bodescu story. You know that a vampire isn\u0027t safe even when he\u0027s dead and buried? If there was anything we learned from the Necroscope, it was that. Even as we burned the very earth where Thibor Ferenczy had been buried, still the bastard was instructing Yulian Bodescu, telling him about E-Branch. After that, the damage Yulian caused us, the deaths, the pain ...\u0027 He paused and shook his head.And Goodly said, \u0027So even at this stage you\u0027re not entirely certain that this is the Necroscope\u0027s work? You think that Jake might be under the influence of someone or something else? Just as Thibor got at Yulian, so someone might be getting at Jake?\u0027\u0027We have to remember what Harry was, and what he became at the end/ Trask answered. \u0027And not only him but his lover Penny Sanderson, and what both the Dweller and Harry\u0027s other son Nestor became.\u0027\u0027Vampires/ Liz said, with a small shudder.\u0027Wamphyri!\u0027 said Trask. \u0027All of them. The Necroscope died on Starside. And now something - three somethings - have come out of Starside to infest our world. And Jake is being influenced by a remnant, or revenant, of the Necroscope himself. Let\u0027s not forget that just as Harry sired Nathan Kiklu, he also fathered Nestor. Two sides of the same coin, do you see? And do you wonder that I\u0027m cautious? Why, of course I\u0027m cautious! I should let something like that infiltrate E-Branch, get in amongst us, learn our secrets, use them against us? No, I don\u0027t think so/\u0027And if you\u0027re wrong?\u0027 said Liz.\u0027I hope I\u0027m wrong!\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027I believe I\u0027m wrong, and I want to be wrong. But if I\u0027m right I\u0027ll be alive, and so will you, Liz. Look, you\u0027ve read about Harry but you never knew him, you haven\u0027t seen what he could do. Not the other things he could do. I have, and I don\u0027t want to see powers such as those fall into the wrong hands. That could mean the end of us all/He sat back in his chair, let his brooding eyes rest specula-tively on Jake and Lardis at the bar, but only for a moment. Then he finished by saying, \u0027So that\u0027s that. For now let it go. Let\u0027s all of us let it go. But Liz, try to remember what I\u0027ve said. And the next time I ask you to do something, don\u0027t be so damn quick off the mark to question my motives . ..\u0027Meanwhile, at the bar, Jake had asked the bartender for a sedative, something to help him sleep during the next stage of the journey. And after the man had gone off to fetch him something:\u0027Haven\u0027t you had enough of sleep?\u0027 Lardis asked him.Jake looked at him. \u0027Sleep is a funny thing,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you know what my doctor told me, when I was laid up in hospital in Marseille that time, after I\u0027d got myself trampled on?\u0027\u0027But how could I possibly know?\u0027 Lardis answered, as yet a long way from mastering the vagaries of the English tongue. \u0027It isn\u0027t as if I was there with you, now is it?\u0027\u0027Anyway,\u0027 said Jake, \u0027I had things to do and wanted to be out of there, but they wouldn\u0027t let me go. And this doctor told me I needed to rest, get some sleep. He said there were different kinds of sleep: a kind that comes from physical exhaustion, and another from mental. And that even when you\u0027ve done no physical or mental work, there\u0027s the kind that tells you your body and brain have been mobile for too long without a decent break. Sleep is a medicine - the best you can get - following injury or mental trauma, yet too much of it can be debilitating rather than curative. You can walk and talk in your sleep, and in some cases solve intricate problems. Sleep can be induced, resisted, prolonged or interrupted, but no one can do without it for too long ...\u0027 As he fell silent, Lardis said, \u0027Phew! Ask a simple question!\u0027 Jake nodded his agreement, said, \u0027I\u0027m not usually so longwinded, but it\u0027s been on my mind - not so much what that doctor said about sleep, but the things he left out. At the time those things didn\u0027t apply to my case. Now they do.\u0027Tm learning a lot about sleep!\u0027 Lardis grunted. \u0027Tell me more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It produces dreams,\u0027 said Jake. \u0027Often they\u0027re enigmatic, insoluble, and they\u0027re usually unremembered because they don\u0027t mean anything. Are you with me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027m learning a lot of new words, too!\u0027 Lardis sighed. \u0027But go on, go on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But from time to time,\u0027 Jake went on, \u0027from time to time, they do mean something. They\u0027re like - I don\u0027t know - clearing houses for all the jumble of our waking hours. And when the rubble has been cleared away, sometimes there\u0027s a silver nugget or two left over.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you\u0027ve been pros - er, prospec - er ...\u0027\u0027Prospecting?\u0027\u0027Right! Right?\u0027\u0027Aboard the jet-copter,\u0027 Jake answered, Tm sure my dream - my nightmare - meant something. And I want to get back into it.\u0027 He offered a weary shrug. \u0027I must be crazy, right? To look forward to returning to a bad dream? But anyway, what the hell? I may have been sleeping, but I didn\u0027t get much rest. I\u0027m still dead on my feet.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s the heat,\u0027 said Lardis. \u0027It drains a man\u0027s strength. I\u0027m tired, too ... we all are. On Sunside I\u0027d probably be under some tree right now, asleep in a deep cool forest. But I\u0027ve had trouble with my dreams, too, Jake. The fact is, I\u0027d probably be nightmaring about the hell that\u0027s brewing in Starside! And that kind of sleep ... well, you\u0027re right: it can\u0027t cure anything.\u0027\u0027Me, I\u0027ll risk it anyway,\u0027 Jake muttered. \u0027Just as soon as I\u0027m back on that chopper ...\u0027When the pilot declared the jet-copter refuelled, the two technicians were the first out across the asphalt. Jake and Lardis were next, and tailing them Trask, Goodly and Liz. They had at least one hundred and fifty yards to walk to the helipad.\u0027Funny thing,\u0027 Goodly reported as they left the embarkation building and set out into the sizzling sunlight, \u0027but what Liz said suddenly makes sense. There\u0027s Jake in plain view, not forty yards ahead, and I can\u0027t read a thing of his future. Not any longer.\u0027\u0027But isn\u0027t that normal?\u0027 Trask was immediately concerned.\\n\\n \u0027Aren\u0027t you always telling us that this talent of yours isn\u0027t controllable, that you can\u0027t just switch it on and off)\u0027Goodly nodded and said, \u0027Right. But I should at least be aware of something. My original prediction, that Jake would be with us for some time to come, hasn\u0027t changed. The future doesn\u0027t chop and change like that; what has been foreseen is inevitable ... or it should be. It\u0027s how it will be, its circumstances, that can change. But now, with Jake, I can\u0027t sense a damn thing! It\u0027s as if there were nothing there.\u0027\u0027Like he\u0027s shielded?\u0027 Now Trask was even more concerned. 1 suppose so, yes,\u0027 said the precog.\u0027Huh!\u0027 Trask grunted. \u0027It\u0027s the same for me. I thought I was imagining it. I still know the truth of him, the reality? But I\u0027m no longer sure whose truth it is.\u0027\u0027Harry\u0027s dart?\u0027 Goodly wondered. \u0027The Necroscope had powerful shields. Has he perhaps passed them on to Jake?\u0027\u0027Yes, Harry was shielded,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027Him, and the traitor Wellesley, too. But Nathan also has shields, and likewise - and especially - the Wamphyri! So Harry isn\u0027t the only one who could have passed this on, whatever it is. And I can\u0027t help thinking: maybe it hasn\u0027t been passed for the best possible reasons. I mean, why should he want to keep us out?\u0027And Liz put in: \u0027Maybe it\u0027s not deliberately or aggressively active, but just... active?\u0027\u0027Like something new, feeling its way?\u0027 Trask said. \u0027Well, it\u0027s possible, I suppose.\u0027\u0027You could always check it out,\u0027 the precog said. \u0027David Chung can locate us - any one of us - just like snapping his fingers. He\u0027d soon tell us if we have something of that nature travelling with us.\u0027\u0027Mindsmog?\u0027 said Trask.\\n\\n By which time Liz was thoroughly alarmed. \u0027Or it could be just his taint!\u0027 she now broke in. \u0027Harry\u0027s taint, I mean. For he was, after all - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - We know what he was,\u0027 Trask quickly cut her short.\u0027And we knew then what he was,\u0027 Goodly said, taking Liz\u0027s side. \u0027And we accepted it. You especially, Ben. It was you who let him go, remember? When Harry\u0027s house - his last vestige on Earth - when we burned it to ashes, you could have killed him then.\u0027\u0027I could have tried,\u0027 said the other.\u0027But you didn\u0027t.\u0027\u0027We all have our talents,\u0027 Trask argued. \u0027Maybe mine told me it wasn\u0027t possible.\u0027\u0027And maybe it told you to let him live,\u0027 said Goodly. (As Trask\u0027s closest friend, he was the only member of E-Branch who had ever been able to talk to him as openly as this.)\u0027I was younger then,\u0027 Trask answered gruffly, \u0027and a sight more foolish. The Necroscope could have been lying when he said he was quitting Earth for Starside. Talent or no talent, Ididn\u0027t have the right to take that chance. But I did. Foolish, as\\n\\n I have said.\u0027Younger I remember,\u0027 the precog nodded. \u0027But foolish? If Harry hadn\u0027t lived, what then? Who would have stopped Shaitan, and given his life for us in the vampire world? And what would have been our fate then? The chance that you took paid offBut now the jet-copter loomed, with Jake leaning out and down, offering a helping hand to Liz. And: \u0027We\u0027ll just have to let it go for now,\u0027 Trask murmured, his voice almost inaudible even to his companions as the engine coughed into life and the rotor blades began slicing the air overhead. \u0027But that doesn\u0027tmean we\u0027ll stop watching. And sooner or later, we\u0027ll see whatMI \u003e WE 11 SEE.What he didn\u0027t tell them, keeping it back for the moment, was that in fact he had already contacted David Chung by telephone from the airport. From now on they wouldn\u0027t be the only ones who were \u0027watching.\u0027And while Chung, the Branch\u0027s top locator, would still be far distant in the purely physical sense, psychically he would be very close indeed - and closer in both senses when he found a relief to take over his duties, allowing him to join up with his colleagues in Brisbane ...... 50 damn hard to get in?! The hinted question but definite exclamation rang like a shout in Jake\u0027s sleeping mind, startling him. But he immediately recognized the Voice\u0027 and said: \u0027You? I was hoping you\u0027d come by.\u0027You could have fooled me! said the ex-Necroscope. But for that tiny piece of me that will be with you always, I wouldn\u0027t know where to find you. Even with it, it\u0027s hard to get through your shields. Still, maybe that\u0027s a good thing. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s going to be, eventually.\u0027But where are you?\u0027 Jake had been waiting for everything to straighten up but nothing had, so that now he wondered: And for that matter, where am IPHe was floating. Not surprising, really, for he had often dreamed he could fly, and as often been disappointed on waking up to discover that he couldn\u0027t. This must be a different version of the same thing. But floating in darkness?You don\u0027t recognize the place? Harry Keogh\u0027s disembodied voice asked him.\u0027A place?\u0027 Jake answered. \u0027But there\u0027s nothing here. Nothing at all.\u0027 And as he lazily turned (or at least he felt like he was turning) on his own axis, he could see that what he had said was literally true. There was absolutely nothing here. As if this were the bottom of a bottomless pit, or the darkest of dark nights, or -\\n\\n Or the kind of nowhere and no~when place that the universe must have been like before there was light? Yes, I know, said Harry. Once experienced, however, there\u0027s no forgetting it. So when we were here last you must have had your eyes shut. I can understand that. It\u0027s always been the same, and for just about everyone who ever tried it - including me! So now let me welcome you to the Mobius Continuum. No gravity or light or matter at all. Not even a sound unless we make it, which isn\u0027t advisable. Not here.\\n\\n \u0027And this is it? Your way of... of getting about?\u0027 This is it. But it\u0027s still only a dream. Your dream, Jake. And the only thing that\u0027s real about it is me.\u0027So how did I get here?\u0027I influenced it, and you dreamed it. I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, and maybe get used to it. For, you see, you\u0027ve been lucky on three occasions now. Three times when you thought you were in danger - two of which you really were - I was close enough to help you out.\u0027My escape from jail?\u0027 Jake nodded his understanding. \u0027And the next time from Bruce Trennier, right?\u0027\\n\\n Right. But as my dart - let\u0027s call it my metaphysical intuition - becomes a more accepted part of you, there\u0027ll be less room for the actual me. Already you\u0027ve reached the stage where you\u0027re almost able to shut me out. But before you can do that, you still have a lot to learn.\\n\\n \u0027About the Mobius Continuum?\u0027For one thing, yes.(Jake was still turning; he didn\u0027t know which way was up, but he wasn\u0027t at all dizzy from it.) \u0027And that\u0027s why I\u0027m here?\u0027You tell me. You dreamed it! But it\u0027s as good a starting place as any.\u0027You did influence it, though?\u0027Yes, but you must have wanted it. Wanted to visit, wanted to know.\u0027To know how to use it, you mean?\u0027Exactly. And how not to misuse it.\u0027Eh?\u0027Well, if this were really it, the Continuum, you\u0027d probably be stone deaf by now. You see, you don\u0027t talk in the Mobius Continuum, Jake - not in a place where even thoughts have weight.\u0027Thoughts have weight here?\u0027They do in the physical world, too. Ask any telepath, or any scientist for that matter. Those tiny sparks that jump the gaps in your brain, Jake? If they didn\u0027t make the connections, you couldn\u0027t think. Have you never wondered why geniuses have \u0027weighty thoughts\u0027?\u0027But that\u0027s just an expression, surely?\u0027But in the Mobius Continuum it\u0027s reality. Well, of sorts. A parallel reality, at least.\u0027So ... I\u0027ve no need to talk?\u0027 Not at all. Thinking will suffice. But here in your dream it makes no difference - because you aren\u0027t talking anyway. Or at best you\u0027re only muttering to yourself.\u0027You\u0027re making me feel like a cretin!\u0027 Jake burst out. \u0027I don\u0027t know where I am or how I got here - or how to get out of here - and you\u0027re telling me I have a lot to learn about it? A lot to learn about nothing, about nowhere, about emptiness?\u0027Oh, it isn\u0027t nothing, Jake. It isn\u0027t nowhere, but a route to every-where and -when! Let me ask you to do something for me ... actually, for you. Just keep quiet for a moment or two, and float. And feel it! Feel the Mobius Continuum!Jake did, and felt it. \u0027It\u0027s ... big/ he said then, feeling very small. \u0027It\u0027s ... huge! It knows I\u0027m here, and it doesn\u0027t especially want me here. But where here?\u0027Everywhere! said Harry. Or anywhere. Anywhere you want to be, want to go, as long as you know the coordinates. Come with me. Just come, and you\u0027ll see.\u0027You mean follow you?\u0027 And suddenly Jake was afraid. \u0027But I can\u0027t even see you!\u0027I\u0027m in your head, Jake. Just let go.\u0027Of you?\u0027Of everything.And Jake did it, let go. He sensed motion in himself, and also felt himself come to a halt. At a door.A time door, said Harry. A door on past time. And:\u0027But this is even more like a ... a ... ahhhh!\u0027 said Jake. Because now he was standing on the threshold, looking back into the past. And while it wasn\u0027t deliberate he was echoing what he seemed to be hearing:\\n\\n A concerted \u0027Ahhhhhk!\u0027 like some unending one-note chorus, the vocal product of a vast choir of angels echoing in a sounding church or cathedral. And yet Jake only seemed to be hearing it; it was in his mind as a result of what he was seeing, which must surely be accompanied by just such a SOUND - the sound of life, of evolution, from its prehistoric source to this present moment, this very NOW.\\n\\n More like A Christmas Carol? Harry finished it for him. Isuppose it is, in a way. But this isn\u0027t a ghost of the past, it is the past - as viewed in Mobius-time.Looking out, looking back, through the door, Jake saw what appeared to be the core of some vastly distant nova, an incredible neon-blue bomb-burst, whose streamers were lines of light. A myriad endlessly twisting, twining, frequently-touching lines or neon tubes of blue light, all reaching out from that central explosion, expanding towards him, rushing upon him like a luminous meteorite shower. Except the tracks didn\u0027t dim but remained printed on space - indeed, printed on time! And all Jake could say was, \u0027W-what?\u0027The blue life-threads of humanity, of all Mankindfrom its very beginning, Harry told him, quietly. And that central nova: that is the beginning, the source, the birthlight a quarter of a billion years ago, when our ancestors crept out of the soupy oceans to evolve primitive lungs on volcanic-lava beaches.\u0027Life-threads?\u0027 Jake whispered. He had scarcely heard the other, was merely repeating him like a man in a dream - which of course he was.The tracks we\u0027ve left in time, Harry answered, like metaphysical fossils. A photograph of Man\u0027s snail-trail, his evolution from his humblest beginnings. The proof of it is there, Jake, right before your eyes. For see, one of those blue life-threads connects with you. Follow it back far enough and you\u0027d see it blaze into being, a pure blue glow to light you on your way through life. The moment you were born, yes ... And:\u0027You don\u0027t appear to have a thread,\u0027 said Jake. But since the explanation was obvious, he quickly went on: \u0027If I were to trip and fall through this door, I might fall all the way back to the Big Bang!\u0027No, Harry told him. But if you willed it you might travel back through all your ancestors to the beginning of life. Awesome, isn\u0027t it? And before Jake could answer:Back there some little way I saw your blue thread crossed by scarlet. But the vampire threads stopped right there, while yours sped on. It was Bruce Trennierand his brood, when they died the true death.\u0027At which time/ Jake frowned, \u0027 - what, just yesterday? - Ihad already received your dart. Some kind of paradox?\u0027He sensed Harry\u0027s shrug, his irritation. But that was one of thereasons you received it! Time is relative; what will be has been. You think oftime as having been, or as being now, or as still to come. But the way I seeit times are just different places, all within reach. It\u0027s the fourth dimension, Jake. And the Mobius Continuum lies parallel to all four. As for paradoxes:they\u0027d be rife if we could actually change the past or see the future. That\u0027s why precogs like lan Goodly have such a hard time of it. It\u0027s why they are allowedto know something of what will be, but never how it will be.Jake looked again through the door and made a futile effort to follow the track of the neon-blue thread that flowed out of him where it twisted and twined its way to his origins. Perhaps he would see what Harry had seen: scarlet threads crossing it in Mobius-time and coming to an end there. But among all the myriad lives that had been, his was soon lost to sight. And:\u0027All the world\u0027s past/ he said.This time I helped you find it, said Harry. The next time - if you should ever need it - you could well he on your own, so try to remember these coordinates. As for future-time doors: that\u0027s easy. They point the other way, that\u0027s all! You\u0027ll work it out (a barely suppressed chuckle) in time.\u0027I... I shouldn\u0027t be here/ said Jake, suddenly dizzy. \u0027I mean, no one should be here/That\u0027s a normal reaction, (Jake sensed Harry\u0027s nod). Anyway, we have to be moving on. Those names you gave me: I found a connection, someone who knew their owners.\u0027N-not in this world, you didn\u0027t/ said Jake, as the time door closed. \u0027They were Wamphyri and came out of Starside/\\n\\n True, said the other, hut they didn\u0027t come alone. I... I have been advised to look up someone who came with them. And I think you should meet him, too.\\n\\n More motion - an acceleration - that Jake sensed rather than felt. \u0027W-where are we going?\u0027\\n\\n To the Refuge.\u0027But it isn\u0027t there any more/Its ruins an.\u0027But why there?\u0027To talk to someone who died there.\u0027Someone who died? Past tense? But we can\u0027t be going into the past. The past-time door has closed/That\u0027s right. And anyway it\u0027s not physically possible, not for you. You couldn\u0027t materialize there. No, we\u0027re going to the Refuge in your present, your now, your dream.\u0027But if this someone is dead, how can we ... ?\u0027Too many huts, said Harry. And anyway, we\u0027re there.\u0027There\u0027 was an awful place to be. Jake was up to his knees in cold water, in a darkness almost as deep as that of the Mobius Continuum itself. The water - river water from the resurgence, he supposed - slopped around his legs and roved on, while the unseen ceiling dripped cold moisture down his collar. The atmosphere was stale, still foul with a lingering stench of smoke, spent explosives, and ... other tastes and taints.As Jake\u0027s eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to make out certain features of this cavern ... and saw that it was more than just a cavern. It was the sump, what was left of it in the aftermath of Zek Foener\u0027s horrific, heroic death. Now he remembered Trask\u0027s story, also something of what Harry Keogh had said: that they were here to talk to someone (a dead someone?) who had come through from Starside with Malinari and the others. And:Oh, he\u0027s here, the incorporeal Harry told him, causing Jake to start yet again. Zek, too, but she has company. Good company, as do a majority of the dead. A Great Majority. When Zek 15 ... when she\u0027s accustomed to all this, then I\u0027ll return and talk to her about old times, remind her that we\u0027ll be together again - all of us - eventually. But that might take some time yet, for Zek was very much alive. She was one of my very dearest friends right to the end. Which reminds me of our reason for being here ... to talk to the other fellow.Harry\u0027s voice had dropped to a low growl; it seemed to Jake that an unaccustomed darkness had crept into it, and a very uncharacteristic threat. So threatening, in fact, that in another moment his mind went into overdrive as he identified the source of his main concern, which until now had mainly been lost among the minutiae and maziness of dreaming: the fact that Harry Keogh was here to talk to someone who was dead.\u0027The other fellow?\u0027 Jake repeated the words of his still unseen companion. \u0027I thought Zek was alone down here? And anyway, how can - you - we - talk - to ... ?\u0027 But by now everything was coming together that much faster, including things Jake really didn\u0027t want to think about, but which were there anyway.Like the meaning of a certain word or name: \u0027Necroscope\u0027. And what the precog lan Goodly had told him about Harry: that he didn\u0027t view life and death the way others did, and his means of communication was similar to telepathy, but he had a different name for it.Like what? Like necromancy?\u0027You\u0027re a necromancer!\u0027 Jake gasped, before he could check himself.NO!!! The incorporeal other\u0027s denial lashed him, like a cry of rage in Jake\u0027s cringing mind. Whatever else I am or may have been, I\u0027m NOT a necromancer! Never call me that again!And now another voice out of nowhere, but sweet as a breath of fresh air to fan Jake\u0027s feverish mind. And despite that he\u0027d never known her, still he knew her: Zek Foener!\\n\\n Necromancer? Ah, no, (her voice was a sigh). Just call him Harry, and know him for a true friend. And as for this - this blessing he gave us, letting us comfort each other through the long lonely night of death - do you take it for an evil thing? Then you\u0027re mistaken. It\u0027s our one light in this eternal darkness. And you may simply call it deadspeak ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-18.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \\n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
