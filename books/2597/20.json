{"id":97219,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"MalinariIn the gloom of the wrecked sump, in the dark of Jake\u0027s dream - which was in fact much more than a dream, indeed a metaphysical connection through Harry Keogh to an ex-lieutenant of the Wamphyri - Korath Mindsthrall continued his story:\u0027There were vampires and vampires. In Starside\u0027s great aeries of the Wamphyri as were, I saw some who were hideous beyond description, too monstrous to look upon even through a thrall\u0027s eyes.\u0027In general they would keep to their manlike outlines, but would shape their various parts to their own design. Their ears were often carved and fretted into fanciful sculptures; convolute nostrils might be pierced and hung with rings of gold; arms lengthened to extend their reach in battle, and teeth permanently enlarged until speech itself was difficult. Lords frequently kept battle-scars as trophies; a flayed cheek might be made to heal so that the white of the bone showed through; a gouged eye could be grown elsewhere than on the face.\\n\\n \u0027In those days there was a young Lord called Lesk the Glut because of his appetites. Stolen as a child out of Sunside, he grew to a youth, became a lieutenant, eventually slew his master for his leech. But Lesk was a madman, and the stolen leech only enhanced his madness. When his murdered master\u0027s familiar\\n\\n warrior hesitated to answer to Lesk\u0027s command, he actually did battle with the thing ... and killed it! He won the fight but lost an eye, which he grew again upon his shoulder.\u0027Organs such as these were rudimentary. Some Lords deliberately affected an extra eye at the nape of the neck ... sufficient to give warning of an attack from the rear. And these eyes would be lidless, so that they could never close in sleep.\u0027I mention these things so as to illustrate the hideousness of which I have spoken. But in fact those Lords - and occasionally Ladies - who affected such alterations or mutilations were usually the weakest of their kind; they only made themselves to look ugly so as to present more fearsome facades in battle, and so perhaps to avoid battle entirely.\u0027Take for example Volse Pinescu, called Lord Wen, which was surely the greatest possible misnomer. What, just one wen, when in all likelihood Volse was the ugliest of all the Lords of the Wamphyri? For it was Lord Wen\u0027s habit to foster hairy blemishes, running sores, and festoons of boils all over his face and form in order that his aspect would be that much more terrifying! Do you see? No clean man or thing would strike him for fear of the drench which must surely ensue!\u0027Even amongst the highest-ranking vampire Lords, there were several such as Lesk and Volse. But then again, there were also those who had no need for such deceptions and affectations. And Nephran Malinari was one of them.\u0027For he was vain and he was handsome ... ah, but this, too, was a fa\u0026pound;ade in its way. For The Mind was a monster underneath, even as monstrous as his mind, if you\u0027ll forgive this puny play on words. But at least in his appearance Lord Malinari was less the beast and more the beautiful human being; more truly, well, \"lordly\", as it were. But for something so very terrible to be so beautiful, surely that were the ultimate deception?\u0027Back to that night:\u0027Seven great flyers had landed on the rim of a broad ledge, a false plateau in the foothills overlooking Vadastra territory.\\n\\n Malinari\u0027s mist (for you may be sure it was of his manufacture) rolled down to flank him and his, then spread out and descended to the forest. It was met by a lesser mist that sprang from the soil and woodlands themselves, so ringing in our rude homes and their central clearing. And all about us a sea of white-lapping mist; and in the clearing itself a ground mist - but unlike any natural mist, sentient and sick-feeling - writhing and twining about the cabins and long-immobilized caravans where the latter were all propped on their empty axles. Malinari\u0027s thoughts were in the mist; they felt things out, searching for treachery. But there was none. Or at least, not towards Malinari.\u0027The wind had fled south and the night was still again. As the mist slowly dispersed, the flyers launched from their foothills ledge and came gliding on stretchy membranous wings.\u0027Now, the flying mounts of the Wamphyri are monstrous creatures, though not so much for any kind of malevolent activity on their part as for their appearance and nature. For while at first glance they seem like giant long-necked and long-tailed bats, on closer inspection ... plainly they are made from men.\u0027 Their wings have enormous span, with the alveolate, once-human skeletons of arms, legs, and grotesquely extended fingers and toes all visible through the sheathing, grey-gleaming membrane of their envelopes. The creatures have massive hearts, to fuel the muscles that power their great wings; other than that they are little more than airfoils of flexible cartilage and hollow bone in sheaths of light, lean meat. In short, they are mainly wings with very little of mind. Built to fly and obey - with their tiny, walnut brains linked invisibly, mentally, to their riders - they do nothing but what their masters will. Oh, they have bits in their mouths and reins for guidance, but only for emphasis when mental commands go lacking a ready response.\\n\\n \u0027So, now you understand me when I speak of \"flyers, descending towards our clearing on their stretchy membrane wings.\" As for their riders:\\n\\n \u0027These soon became visible. Three of the seven - those in themiddle of the V-formation - were at ease, arrogant, haughty in their ornate leather saddles; the others were young lieutenants, eager, forwards-leaning, and feral-eyed. It was probably the first time they had been allowed to venture forth with Malinari\u0027s tithesmen. But the figure to which every eye was drawn was that in the dead centre of the aerial tableau. To him, and to his mount.\u0027That central flyer was by far the largest, strongest, and most elaborately fashioned; a handful of good men - perhaps as many as six or seven - had gone into its construction in Malinari\u0027s vats of metamorphosis in Malstack, in Starside. Gliding down towards the clearing, the huge but human eyes in its half-human head at the end of that long, snaky neck, swung this way and that, seeking an acceptable landing place; while black and seemingly vacant saucer eyes in its belly lidded themselves in preparation, so as not to suffer damage in the landing.\u0027Ah, but when I speak of eyes, do not let me forget those of the rider where they glowed like small scarlet lamps in his face. Of course they did, for this was Lord Nephran Malinari - Malinari the Mind himself.\u0027His flyer\u0027s wings formed themselves into air-scoops; its tail - the elongated, knuckled spine of a man - swung this way and that, keeping balance; coiled tentacles like springs extended down from belly cavities, their sensitive tips tracing the contours of the ground. Then, with a sighing of air and a folding of wings, the thing set down light as a feather. And flanking it, six lesser beasts likewise touched down, their lieutenant riders out of their saddles and striding to their master\u0027s side all in a few liquid moments. While for those same moments Malinari sat there as if in contemplation, reins loosely clasped, one elbow on the pommel of his saddle, and chin in hand.\u0027Then, stirring himself up, he swung lithely down from his mount, sighed and said, \"Well, and here we are ...\" Simply that, the merest murmur of a sound; yet powered by Malinari\u0027s mentalism, every man, woman, and child in the entire Vadastra\\n\\n settlement heard it.\u0027 And to every mind he touched - despite that his voice was brandy-deep and honey-sweet - a certain fetor clinging. For with all his powers of deception, even Malinari could not hide the underlying stench of blood.\u0027His mentalism had its limits. Spread thin as this, it was good for seeking out enemies or Szgany in hiding, but for very little else. So that having displayed it he now dispensed with it. And the swift withdrawal of his probes felt like water clearing from one\u0027s ears after surfacing from a dive in a deep pool. And now, too, he called for my father Dinu in a voice both rich and strong. But while the brandy depth was still there, the sweetness was all used up. For now it was time for the business.\u0027The Vadastras (all except the few favoured ones, who were hidden away) were gathered as a clan on that side of the clearing farthest from the barrier mountains, so positioned that all eyes had been enabled to follow the arrival of Malinari and his tithesmen. My father, who stood central and to the fore of this gathering, came with all speed in answer to Malinari\u0027s call and prostrated himself before his acknowledged master. And the vampire Lord stood there a little while, looking down on him, perhaps enjoying his grovelling.\\n\\n \u0027But, ahhhh - this Malinari was handsome! He was all of an hundred and sixty years old, but looked no more than forty. His hair was black and shone like a night-hawk\u0027s wing - as well it might, being greased with the fat of Vadastra women! Swept back from the broad dome of his head, behind pointed ears which were not as large or misshapen as the webby, conch-like ears of most Lords, and with its jet ringlets curled on his caped shoulders, while its gleaming black curtain fanned out down his back like the hair of a young girl, or the decorative head plumage of the black eagle ... why, it loaned him the haughty looks of a great hunting bird - a veritable night-hawk, aye.\u0027 And for once it was no deception; for as much as he was anything, Malinari was certainly the bird of prey.\\n\\n \u0027And his face, its deathly pallor ... the deep-sunken eyesunder arcing eyebrows ... cheek-bones jutting ... the high brow rising ... slightly flattened nose whose convolute flanges were almost imperceptible ... the lean cheeks and perfect bow of his blood-red lips. The red of blood, aye, to match the fire of his eyes. In any other man or vampire the fiery lamps of Malinari\u0027s eyes would be less than ornamental, but they suited The Mind to perfection. Indeed, they loaned his cheeks a ruddy semblance of warmth, of life, while in fact he was the cold and cruel master of something other than life, but not yet death.\u0027And tall: he would be two long paces tall, and then some. And slim as a wand, yet strong as a dozen of our best, who were only men. I knew this last for a certainty, for there never was a weak Lord of the Wamphyri. But Malinari\u0027s strength wasn\u0027t of the flesh alone; not only brawn, but brain; not merely muscle, but mind. He was The Mind!\u0027And, \"Up,\" he finally commanded my father. \"Up, and show me my tribute.\"\u0027There was no kissing of sandalled feet, nor yet of hands, as my father came erect; no touching of any sort. Such were The Mind\u0027s powers that even a touch could prove harmful, draining a man\u0027s knowledge or erasing part of his memory. And anyway, Dinu was Malinari\u0027s trusted servant who would not dare hold anything back from him. This was how it had been between them for many a shameful year. Shameful, aye. For if I\u0027ve not already said that I loathed this cringing, subservient existence, surely by now I have hinted as much?\u0027Anyway:\\n\\n \u0027My father was big, burly, bearded, and blustering. Rumour had it that he was a bastard, too, but I never heard it bruited in his presence. Puffed up with his own importance, yet somehow managing to bow and scrape, he led Malinari and his men to that side of the clearing where the trestle tables were bowed a little from the weight of the tribute. Here Dinu Vadastra had been as clever as he dared to be, so arranging the trestles that the centre spans were bound to bow a little under any extra weight!\\n\\n Whether or no his ploy fooled anyone, it certainly looked good. And indeed Malinari seemed impressed.\u0027Then he and my father conversed. And because Dinu\u0027s caravan stood very close to the trestle tables, and the night being so still now (and likewise all those who were not directly involved, keeping very still), Nadia and I heard their every word.\u0027\"Dinu, chief of the clan Vadastra,\" Malinari spoke to my father. \"It appears you had word of my coming. I would even say you must have had, since you\u0027ve responded with this oh-so-excellent tribute! What\u0027s more, try as I might I cannot remember the time when my tithesmen brought home so handsome a bounty. What? Why, I could even be forgiven for thinking that perhaps they\u0027ve been robbing me all this time. My own lieutenants, like ungrateful dogs, thieving from the house that shelters them :..\"\u0027He stared at his men - glared at them with eyes of flame, lengthened his jaws and yawned at them a little - so that they all drew back a pace ... until he grinned a wolfs grin at them, then threw back his great head and laughed until his hair shimmered all down his back!\u0027\"Ah, but see, I have made a joke,\" he said. \"For all and all, my lieutenants, thralls, and familiar creatures know that to thieve from me is to bid farewell to all this. My rules are made simple, so that even a dullard may understand them. In my manse in Starside dwell many starveling warriors who have their needs no less than men; from time to time they enjoy the occasional tidbit, and to a monster they are especially fond of tidbits that kick and shriek and spurt red ...\"\u0027And after a pause, turning to my father: \"Dry work, this joking,\" he said. \"Are we perhaps thirsty, Dinu Vadastra?\" And he beckoned to his side a junior lieutenant.\\n\\n \u0027By then, as might well be imagined, my father was very thirsty. He produced a tray of beaten gold, and three goblets of that same common metal which he filled with white wine from a barrel. This was ever the ritual: that Dinu play the part of one\\n\\n of Lord Malinari\u0027s food-tasters. For, like all of the Wamphyri but more so than most, The Mind was susceptible to silver in however small a measure - indeed, to granules of silver, to the very dust of silver - and likewise to garlic, whose mere reek was guaranteed to cause nausea and copious vomiting. Thus Dinu would take the first sip, which would provide him with an early opportunity to declare the wine fouled; next the tithesman who, being a vampire, would not only taste any poison but react violently to it; and finally Malinari, first inhaling deeply of the wine\u0027s bouquet through his snout\u0027s fleshy runnels, before gulping it down. For however much he affected lordly airs, and, on occasion, a \"flowery\" or \"delicate\" mode of speech, still Lord Malinari\u0027s table manners were dreadful!\\n\\n \u0027So on through every barrel, a taste from each; the brandies, too, and even the honey. And while my father was sensible enough to drink but sparingly, still he was staggering a little towards the end. As for the foodstuffs - the wild grain, roots and fruits, animals and such, aye, and bairns, too - they were not tested, though for a fact Malinari lingered a while over a fat boy child whose black eyes smiled at him in all innocence, while the monster\u0027s own crimson orbs flared that much brighter in his face ...\u0027Then on to the wolf-bitch in her cage: \"A prize indeed!\" Malinari approved. \"I may keep her and her whelps both,\" and he made as if to stroke her through the bars. But, growling low in her throat, she snapped at him, and Malinari withdrew his hand with no room to spare, saying, \"Or perhaps not. For wolves are plaguy, treacherous beasts at best. But fine strong meat, Dinu Vadastra, I\u0027ll grant you that. And on that same subject, where, pray, are the rest of my animals - the ones who walk upright?\"\u0027With which the unfortunate ones, all sorted and chained in a row - a man, a girl, a youth, a woman, and so on - were trooped out for Malinari\u0027s inspection. They had been caused to void themselves (for the sake of \u0027cleanliness\u0027), then had been washed, groomed, and clad in good fur robes fastened with golden clasps.\\n\\n And there they paraded, most with bowed heads, but a few of the younger men muttering (however unwisely), and the adult women sobbing, and this or that young girl far too prideful, too aware of her lithe Szgany sensuality, head tilted and dark eyes fluttering, daring to gaze on Malinari and even hoping to impress him. Ah, but The Mind was not easily impressed.\\n\\n \u0027He walked the line - or rather flowed along it, with that deceptive grace of the Wamphyri - and his tithesmen with him, senior men to the fore and juniors well to the rear. And whenever Malinari paused to look closer at one of his male acquisitions, then his senior lieutenants would step forward and take hold of the man, forcing wide his jaws so that the Great Vampire could examine his teeth. Then they would unfasten his gold clasp, displaying his naked body, and sometimes Malinari might indicate his approval of a youth\u0027s long limbs and broad shoulders, murmuring, \"This one is for the making, I think. In Malstack, my vats stand empty.\" Or, \"This one is a fighting man, tall and well muscled, aye.\" Or again, he might say nothing at all, but simply shake his head. For there was always the provisioning.\\n\\n \u0027In a while he came to one of those too-proud girls, who dared to gaze upon him, and paused. Again his senior tithesmen moved forward, one of them reaching for the clasp at the girl\u0027s throat to open her robe. But she was a beauty, and the lieutenant too eager. Noticing this, Lord Malinari caught at his hand and stayed it, then narrowed his eyes in a frown, saying:\u0027 \"Ah, but see how your blood courses, Stefanu. Why, I can feel it pulsing through your veins like a raging river.\u0027 And so you\u0027re a lustful one, are you? But you know - now that I think of it - I have often wondered why, when I send you out to collect my tithes, I get so few virgins ... ?\"\u0027 \"Master, I - \" said Stefanu, trying to back off. But Malinari held him, saying:\\n\\n \u0027Ah, ah, be still!\" And he touched the index finger of his free hand to the man\u0027s brow. Stefanu groaned, jerked, began to lift his right hand where it was sheathed in a murderous gauntlet. This was a wholly reflex action, nothing more, but Malinari had seen it. His eyes blazed up at once, like coals under the bellows, and as his jaws elongated and his lips curled back from scythe-like teeth, so Stefanu fell to his knees and begged for mercy.\u0027Then for long moments Malinari\u0027s index finger trembled on his lieutenant\u0027s forehead, and his face writhed in a passion as he read the man\u0027s thoughts, at least the ones that were important to him. Until suddenly, straining as if from some enormous effort of will, he snatched back his hand and snarled:\u0027 \"Oh, you miserable, lecherous man! Consider yourself fortunate, for while I have had your thoughts, I\u0027ve left your mind intact. Not out of any love for you, Stefanu Mindsthrall - ravisher of my women before I\u0027ve so much as seen them - but because I may soon have need of you. And treacherous? Did I not see you raise your hand, your war-gloved hand, against me? Did you dare think to strike me? Perhaps you did! And so for now... begone! Remove! Take yourself from my sight. Get to your flyer and wait for me there, and consider your treacherous ways: what you have done this night, and to whom, and what it would be like to live out the rest of your life floundering and drooling, mindless in a pit of your own wastes - which might yet be your get from all this!\"\u0027He released Stefanu, and when he had wriggled away, stumbled to his feet and fled, Malinari said to the girl, \"My dear, give me your hand.\" She obeyed him at once. And using his mentalism he saw what only he could see, then asked her, \"Are you truly a virgin?\"\u0027\"Oh yes, my Lord,\" she answered. And Malinari nodded and smiled.\u0027 \"Had you said no,\" he told her, \"I might have made you a lieutenant\u0027s woman, for your honesty. But I abhor liars however pretty - especially little whores who would attempt my seduction by trying to hide their thoughts from me. Wherefore ... no high station for you, young lady, but there are common thralls in my manse who will enjoy instructing you. Or you them, whichever!\" And, wrinkling his nose, he shrugged and turnedO \u0026#8482;Oaway from her.\u0027Malinari\u0027s inspection was over. And now he told Dinu Vadastra, \"I am not displeased. Not with you and yours. But you\u0027ve seen how I deal with them who would deny me my due. So now tell me truly: was this the best you could do?\"\u0027\"The Vadastras have never made finer wines or brandies,\" my father answered. \"As for the foodstuffs, no better flesh may be bred or hunted, no purer honey or sweeter fruits foraged. On my word, my Lord, this is our best.\"\u0027\"And what of the tithe in human flesh?\" Malinari glanced at the robed ones in their chains. \"Are these also the best you have to offer, or do you hold something in reserve?\"\u0027\"Again I\u0027ve done my best,\" Dinu told him. \"But certainly I must have a reserve - of good blood, good flesh for breeding - lest the Vadastras falter and become useless to you.\"\u0027And Malinari nodded and said, \"This was always our understanding, aye. But Dinu, take heed, hard times are coming, and my needs are great. Do you see this dark cloud hanging over us, like a portent of ill-omen? What say you, chief of the Vadastras? It seems to me it bodes not well.\"\u0027And when my father glanced at the heavens - indeed there was a dark and hovering cloud, which until now had gone mainly unnoticed. It turned slowly in the night-dark skies over Vadastra territory, and within its writhing mass, riding the laden air, darker shapes seemed hidden.\u0027So that Dinu\u0027s voice was less certain, small and faltering, as he inquired, \u0027\"W-w-what does it mean, my Lord?\"\u0027But The Mind\u0027s \"cultured\" tones were grown very deep and menacing now, and his scarlet eyes more truly aflame as he answered, \"It means that despite our - what, our friendship? - and despite that you have been a true and honest man ...\"\\n\\n \u0027At which point there sounded a small commotion; a fluttering figure appeared at the rim of the tableau, and: \"What? A true and honest man, this Dinu Vadastra? This so-called chief?\\n\\n This great thief? I say wait, give me but a moment to show you that you are wrong, my Lord!\" The voice was shrill and female.\u0027And Nadia, where she huddled close to me in my father\u0027s caravan, started and gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. For she had recognized the voice: that of her mother, Melana Zetra, who came hurrying now from her hiding place. And:\u0027\"But what is this?\" Malinari arched his eyebrows, and his forehead creased in a frown. \"Someone dares to raise her voice, to interfere, and to command Nephran Malinari to wait?\"\u0027For a moment Dinu Vadastra was stunned; likewise the rest of the clan, including Nadia and myself. But as Melana came in a rush, her hair awry and her face gaunt with fear - the terror of what she was about - it was observed that she wore a robe of offering. And indeed she was offering herself, of her own free will, to Malinari and his tithesmen! Ah, but she was offering a deal more than that.\u0027\"What?\" said Malinari again, in utter amaze, as she threw herself down before him, clawing the earth at his feet. \"Is she a mad thing, that she interferes with the tithe?\"\u0027 \"Mad with grief!\" Melana cried, tearing her hair, throwing off her robe and kneeling there naked. \"Mad with rage, and with outrage. For I have been cheated and used badly. My people, too, and even you, my Lord, cheated! All of us - by this man!\" And she pointed a trembling finger at Dinu.\u0027It was the beginning of the end. And any observer could be forgiven for thinking that Dinu was himself Wamphyri - the way his eyes popped out like plums in his face, and the way he bared his teeth - as he threw himself upon Melana and bore her down. His knife rose over the tangle they made ... until Malinari took it from him, tossed it away, then grabbed Dinu by the scruff of the neck and drew him upright. And:\u0027\"Speak up!\" he commanded Nadia\u0027s mother. \"How have I been cheated? Oh, be sure I could learn it my way, but the process is harmful and your chief might easily lose all powers of reason. Moreover, I would like him to hear for himself what may yet harm him even more. So say on, woman: tell me how Dinu Vadastra has betrayed me.\" He looked at my father dangling in his grasp, his sandalled feet barely touching the ground, then grunted and thrust him away, sending him sprawling to the earth. Dinu would have attacked Melana again, at once, but a pair of lesser lieutenants were at his side, their gauntlets ready. And so he kept still.\u0027Then Melana spoke up, and the complaints she listed were the selfsame grievances that every decent Vadastra man, woman, or child capable of reasoned and intelligent thought had carried in his or her heart for long and long, without ever daring to give them substance. She spoke of the chiefs many prejudices, and of his favourites - such as herself - who remained hidden away, secret and undisclosed to the Great Lord of Vampires, when he sent his tithesmen out of Starside to collect his tribute; and of Dinu\u0027s treachery to his own tribesmen: how, if he were jealous of a man\u0027s prowess, or if he should be bested in some piddling campfire argument, then the better man might expect to find himself listed for the tithe. So that for long and long, no one had dared say Dinu no.\u0027Melana went on and on, as if she would never end. For as my father\u0027s odalisque, she had been privy to a great many wicked things in his caravan - all of his conspiracies with his cronies - in the time since her good husband, Banos, had been taken in the tithe. And so she lashed Dinu with her unforgiving tongue, which all the while gathered fire and passion; for Melana knew that, one way or the other, it was all done with now, and so she might as well do her worst.\\n\\n \u0027Then, towards the end, she spoke of her man, Banos Zetra; but here she broke down, sobbing her heart out when telling how Banos - a hunter whose contributions to the tithe had been significant - had been carried off to Malstack in Starside simply because Dinu Vadastra had fancied his wife for himself, and for no other reason.\\n\\n \u0027\"And here I kneel before you,\" she finished at last, \"theliving proof of all that I have said. But my man is in Starside and there\u0027s no place here for me now, for which reasons I would venture over the barrier mountains with you and yours, into the dark. And what of the ones that Dinu has hidden from you, great Lord? My daughter, whom he saves for his own worthless son. Aye, and that selfsame son, Korath, who skulks like a whipped dog in his father\u0027s caravan there?\u0027 At the last she threw herself flat on the earth, sobbing and clasping Malinari\u0027s feet.\u0027And Malinari was silent for a while, as he considered all that he had been told. But meanwhile his men were not idle. Two of them were at the withe door of my father\u0027s caravan; finding it barred from within, they tore it from its hinges. And one of them poked his head in and saw us, calling out: \"They are here, my Lord. A youth and a girl, huddled in the dark like mice. The woman spoke the truth.\"\u0027 \"So,\" said Malinari, and his voice was doomful quiet now, even as quiet as the strange dark clouds circling overhead. \"If she spoke the truth, then someone has lied. Bring these mice to me.\"\u0027But my father cried out, \"My Lord! Have mercy, I beg you! He is my son, and the girl is his woman, and ...\"\u0027 \"And ... you kept them from me,\" said Malinari, silencing him with a glance. \"I was not shown them, nor asked if I wanted them. You desired no mercy of me then, only now. Like the child who steals a plum then asks if he may have one. Or in this case two plums ... or three, if we include this good brave woman.\"\u0027He stooped and caught up Melana\u0027s robe, took her shoulder and drew her to her feet. \"Cover yourself,\" he said. \"I believe there may be a position for a hard-working woman - as an overseer of women - in Malstack in Starside. Moreover, I know of a certain thrall called Banos, who has not taken any woman of the manse in all the time he has served me. And Banos has served me well... unlike several I could name.\" He gloomed on Dinu Vadastra, then across the clearing to where a certain senior lieutenant sat all morose astride his flyer.\\n\\n \u0027And though Melana fastened her warm robe about her, still she shivered. She had felt the weird cold when Malinari touched her, the tendrils of sentient ice that flowed from his fingers. Yet still she was the brave one. \"What of my daughter, my Lord? My beloved child, still innocent despite this unworthy Korath\u0027s vile embraces?\"\u0027Malinari looked at her and raised an eyebrow. \"You should be aware,\" he said, \"of the thin line between bravery and utter folly. I\u0027m not much known for listening to complaints, and even less for granting wishes.\" But then he sighed, and said, \"First let me see this girl, this - \"\u0027\"Nadia,\" Melana told him.\u0027\"As you will,\" Malinari nodded. \"This Nadia. And for that matter, this unworthy Korath, too.\" And his lieutenants dragged Nadia and myself before him. Thus I came face to face with Lord Nephran Malinari, of the Wamphyri.\u0027\u0027 \"Are you your father\u0027s son?\" he questioned me. \u0027 \"Eh? Er, pardon?\" (For how to answer such a question?) \u0027 \"Eh? Pardon?\" He mimicked me. \"Are you a cheat and a liar like your father, Dinu Vadastra?\"\u0027Well, I wasn\u0027t like my father to that extent. But big and brawny I was, and perhaps a little stupid, too. \"I\u0027m no cheat,\" I told him. \"And no man calls me a liar.\"\u0027When he moved I did not even see it! But I felt his clout, the thud of his back-hander against the side of my head, making my ears ring and knocking me off my feet. Well, it seemed plain to me that I had offended him. Now it was time to die - but not without a fight. I sprang up - and was at once pinioned by the men who had brought us from the caravan. But struggle as best I might I couldn\u0027t shift them or throw them off. And Malinari, he laughed, saying:\\n\\n \u0027 \"Hold still and listen. You are big and handsome, and you are strong as a bull shad ... and you are mine.\u0027 Unworthy? Well, maybe. We\u0027ll wait and see if blood runs true.

But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \\n Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \\n If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \\n But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry.
