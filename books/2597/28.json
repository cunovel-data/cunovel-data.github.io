{"id":97227,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Mindsmog! In general, Trask\u0027s briefing would be the very simplest thing. As yet he wasn\u0027t speaking to a full team - and he wasn\u0027t about to mention his private arrangement with Premier Gustav Turchin to any others than core members of E-Branch - but in the current lull he knew that he needed to keep his people sharp, keep them in the picture and give them some sort of incentive. Thus, while he intended to stick to a loose broad-screen scenario or overview, still he would remind them of what they were dealing with here, emphasizing the extreme dangers of the job in hand. His audience included everyone available, which left only the technician Jimmy Harvey doing Duty Officer in the Ops Room; but in fact Trask\u0027s words were directed mainly at the Australian Military contingent. Dressed in casual, lightweight summer \u0027civvies/ and while for the moment they didn\u0027t much look like soldiers, in fact these young special-forces officers were the best that their vast country had to offer. Which was to say (in their own down-to-earth terms, and as members of an elite Australian regiment) they were \u0027bloody useful in a scrap, mate\u0027.\u0027I know we\u0027ve been over some of this before/ Trask began, \u0027but I just want to make it plain what we\u0027re dealing with. That job we did in the Gibson Desert - Bruce Trennier and his creatures - it wasn\u0027t big stuff. Trennier was a lieutenant, a righthand man, but he wasn\u0027t the boss by any means. Just what he and those others were doing out there in the middle of nowhere, we still aren\u0027t sure. Maybe that entire set-up was just a bolthole, somewhere that the big chief could run to if things went wrong. But as for the boss himself - who incidentally could as easily be herself - he or she is here, not far away from us even as I speak. At least that\u0027s our belief. It\u0027s what our experts are telling us.\u0027Now, that night when we camped out in the Gibson Desert. After the fireworks were over, one of you - no names, no pack drill - asked me a question. Normally it would be a perfectly reasonable question: why couldn\u0027t we take a lesser creature, a thrall, captive in order to talk to him, study him, and try to see what makes him tick? Which as I\u0027ve said would seem reasonable ... if we were dealing with an entirely human enemy. But circumstances being what they are, and our enemy being what he is, your question told me that you were either poorly informed, or you hadn\u0027t understood your original briefing, or you really didn\u0027t appreciate what you\u0027d been dealing with that night. And for all I know, it mightn\u0027t be just one man I\u0027m speaking about here, but all of you could have the same problem.\u0027So, despite that I\u0027ve had experience of these things in the past - or maybe because I have - and you people are newcomers to the game, I tried to put myself in your shoes. Maybe it had seemed too easy. Unpleasant, yes, but not really difficult. And I began to see what the problem was. You\u0027ve probably seen yourselves as men with a nasty job to do ... but someone has to do it, right? I mean, maybe it seemed to you that these people you were killing were like, what - escapees from an isolation ward somewhere? - and you were putting them down simply to ensure they didn\u0027t pass on the infection. A pretty effective preventative measure, certainly, but perhaps a bit drastic to your way of thinking.\u0027So, let\u0027s go back to that perfectly reasonable question: why don\u0027t we just immobilize these things, lock them away, and study them? And wouldn\u0027t that be a far less drastic solution? \u0027Well, let me tell you again - let me remind you - about vampires: \u0027Oh, they can be downed. Shoot at them with bullets, especially silver bullets, and you can knock them down ... even if they don\u0027t always stay down. Burn them - burn them entirely - and they die. Lock them up in silver cages, and keep their systems topped up with garlic so that they can\u0027t work up a head of steam, and you might even manage to confine them - for a little while. But as for studying them ... \u0027Only make a mistake - your first mistake, just one - and you become the prisoner. And you don\u0027t get a second chance. \u0027Think of it this way. Men have devised chemical and biological weapons, toxins and living viruses, that could wipe us all out - destroy Mankind itself - if they were to get loose. We keep these things in secure laboratories where we study and even develop them. Well, when I say \"we,\" I mean men: \"scientists,\" in outlawed lands mainly, dabbling in a mainly outlawed science. For happily a majority of governments have long since banned all such agents; they deem them simply too terrible for study or development, and they\u0027re right. \u0027But the unpleasant fact is that because some people continue to experiment with this stuff, our people are obliged to follow suit in order to find vaccines and antidotes. They don\u0027t want us to be caught with our immune systems down, as it were. So yes, these terrible poisons still exist in just about every country that\u0027s capable of handling them. But by God, you\u0027d better believe they take damn good care not to spill this stuff!\u0027So then, why am I bothering to tell you what you probably already know, and what does it have to do with vampires and the Wamphyri? Well, it\u0027s this simple:\u0027If you think of the Wamphyri and their works in just such terms of reference you won\u0027t go far wrong. That is, you have to think of them as something that must be destroyed. But whatever you do don\u0027t think of them on the same scale of danger! I mean, we all know that the Richter scale is a yardstick for the power of earthquakes. But if it was a scale for all potential disasters, then to cover man-made biological weapons it would have to stretch from the current nine to ninety, and to cover the Wamphyri it would need to carry on from ninety to infinity! That\u0027s by my personal scale of reckoning, and I am not wrong.\u0027And remember: our man-made toxins and viruses aren\u0027t bent on escaping; they can\u0027t think!Rut only imprison a vampire, and from that moment on he\u0027s thinking of ways to get free. He wants to be free, like you, and wants you to be a prisoner, like him. The prisoner of something growing inside you, that will gradually make you someone - something - else. Something other.\u0027So then, now maybe you can see why we can\u0027t suffer a vampire to live. The point being, we really won\u0027t suffer a vampire to live. Be sure of this: if you get infected, there\u0027s no cure. Which means we\u0027ll kill you. Oh, it\u0027ll be clean, but it will happen.\u0027So remember, a moment or so after one of us - I include myself - shows up positive, he also shows up dead ... \u0027And on that point, enough said ... \u0027Now let\u0027s move on:\u0027We think it\u0027s likely that our quarry has a hideout somewhere in the mountains. Where they come from, the Wamphyri are very fond of their aeries - the places where they live - and the higher the better. Unfortunately that doesn\u0027t tell us very much, doesn\u0027t narrow down his or her location. For as you know as well or better than I do, there are mountains galore around here. But there\u0027s also a paradox in that the Wamphyri don\u0027t go much on sunlight. And right now we\u0027ve rather a surfeit of that, too! Weird, wouldn\u0027t you say, that our alien friend has chosen to set up shop here? Well, maybe not. \u0027You see, he\u0027s not dumb. He knows that we know his habits, and that we\u0027ve known about his \"invasion\" from square one. That means he also knows that normally this would be one of the last places we\u0027d expect to find him. So where better to hide himself away and do his thing, whatever that thing is? The only problem is, he might also know that we found and dealt with Bruce Trennier, and by now he could well be expecting us to come looking for him here. Indeed, he could already know that we\u0027ve arrived. And if so he\u0027ll be doubly dangerous, because there\u0027ll be little or no element of surprise. \u0027Okay, we have a couple of days before our back-up squads and the big ops vehicle are in situ. And that has to be one of our first priorities: to find suitable and preferably non-obtrusive sites, with access to principal mountain approach roads, where we can harbour these men and vehicles as they arrive. So as of noon today we\u0027ll be air-mobile again, but not in the jet-copters that you\u0027ve grown used to. They may have been great in the desert, but to Brisbane\u0027s civilian population - not to mention our quarry - aircraft that look like they do are bound to attract attention. So for the time being they\u0027ll be on standby in hangars at the airfield where we came in. \u0027So, there\u0027s a firm in town that does aerial sightseeing trips by helicopter, north along the Coastal Range to Gladstone, and south over the Macphersons and along the Richmond Range as far as Grafton. Which is ideal for our purposes in that it covers the ground we\u0027re interested in, and the pilots know all the routes by heart and have first-class local knowledge. Alas that we can\u0027t simply commandeer this firm, its men and machines; but no, that would be to give the show away, and so we\u0027ll be paying our way. But I will try to get us a bit more clout than the average tourist. Obviously we have to have the final say on where we fly and what we look at. So later this morning I\u0027ll speak to Prime Minister Lance Blackmore and see if he can sort something out for us.\u0027Very well, so assuming we\u0027re airborne again, what will we be looking for? Military commanders, you\u0027ll be looking for naturally concealed campsites for your contingents, harbour areas, and access routes. And you\u0027ll also be checking your maps, doing an aerial reconnaissance of the entire area. As for my people:\u0027We\u0027ll be scanning the mountain heights for our quarry. In truth, we don\u0027t really know what we\u0027re looking for; we can only hope we\u0027ll know it when we see it. But it isn\u0027t all blind luck. Two of my men, Lardis Lidesci and David Chung, are specialists in this regard. One of them will travel in each chopper.\u0027Okay, that\u0027s it. From midday or soon after we should have these planes at our disposal. Get your maps, cameras, and whatever else you\u0027ll need sorted out now. As for myself: well, much as I\u0027d like to be going with you, my duty for the time being is right here. Someone has to watch the shop.\u0027A final reminder. This is a covert operation. Try not to give anything away to these civilian pilots. Have a set of answers ready to hand. For instance, you could be fire chiefs carrying out preliminary aerial surveys, ensuring there won\u0027t be a second Great Fire of Brisbane. Something along those lines. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll think of something.\u0027That\u0027s it, and I hope I didn\u0027t bore you too much. Gentlemen, thanks for your time and attention ...\u0027Brisbane\u0027s Skytours helicopters were small, conventional pleasure machines custom-built for the job. Capable of carrying four passengers, they had wraparound plexiglass side windows which allowed for superb viewing, but would prove a shade vertiginous for people with height problems. As the Old Lidesci would later describe it, it was like flying in a bubble!\u0027 - and he didn\u0027t much like it. The only other problem was their range. Two hundred and eighty miles was their safety limit without refuelling; which meant that a chopper on the northern route must land at a small airport in Gladstone, and on the southern route in Grafton. The good side of that was that it gave the passengers time to take on food and water to see them through the return trip. The pilots were isolated up front behind see-through bulkheads, and they communicated with their passengers on headsets. But since in the main their commentaries consisted of monologues learned parrot-fashion over years of flying the same routes, pretty soon the drone of their voices became one with the whirring of rotors and ceased to have meaning. If passengers didn\u0027t want to listen they removed their headsets; when they wished to converse or ask questions, they replaced them. A simple system.In the early afternoon, Jake flew south toward the Macpherson Range with lan Goodly, the Old Lidesci, and an Australian Major whose rank was never on display or used to unfair advantage; he had his job to do and was simply another member of the team. But truth be told, it was a strange team. The precog was there in the uncertain hope that should they fly over an \u0027aerie\u0027 - in whatever shape or form - he might catch a glimpse of some significant future event and recognize it for what it was. The SAS Major had his own tasks to perform; he understood that Jake, Goodly, and the old man were \u0027specialists\u0027 in their own right, but in what specific areas he neither knew nor cared.As for Jake: ostensibly he had been sent along so that he could \u0027get a good look at the lie of the land,\u0027 but he assumed that in fact it was to keep him out of Trask\u0027s way. And he was partly right: Trask hadn\u0027t wanted him around cluttering up the place, asking awkward questions, generally getting in the way. But that wasn\u0027t the whole story. Mainly Jake had been sent out with Lardis and lan Goodly in the hope that something of their team spirit might rub off on him. And truth to tell, Jake was actually developing a strong feeling of kinship with the Old Lidesci, and he already acknowledged a growing measure of respect for Goodly ... this despite that the precog seemed as enigmatic as ever. As for the Australian Major: Jake wasn\u0027t about to mention (or invite questions about) his own brief \u0027career\u0027 as a member of the original British Special Air Service. For, after all, he had been \u0027required to leave\u0027 in rather short order, and compared to this professional would seem the veriest amateur. But at least he had remembered some of his training ... the useful, more deadly bits, anyway. And there they sat, scanning the beautiful, sun-bleached coastal strip far below, the valleys and hills, but especially the rearing mountains, as the Skytours helicopter whirled them south, and their pilot/tour-guide\u0027s monologue droned on and on in their headsets ...Flying north along the Coastal Range, the locator David Chung shared a second Skytours helicopter with two SAS Warrant Officers and Liz Merrick. It said a lot for their personal discipline and commitment that these fit young Australians were able to concentrate on their work with Liz along. For her part, she was aware of the occasional appreciative glance at her curvaceous figure in tight-fitting jeans and loose shirt. But while the SAS men found this British \u0027Sheila\u0027 easy to talk to, frank and friendly, they also knew that she was a member of E-Branch and so must be special in ways other than the purely physical. And she was treated accordingly, with the utmost courtesy.Liz was part of this second team in her capacity as a telepath. Not that her talent was in any way specific to vampires, but if David Chung were to detect mindsmog, that might provide her with a target area, a \u0027direction\u0027 in which to cast her mental net if only to corroborate the locator\u0027s find. Before letting her go, however, Ben Trask had cautioned her that that was as much as she could do, and had warned her:\u0027Liz, you\u0027d better know what you could be up against. That stuff with Bruce Trennier? Child\u0027s play by comparison with what you could expect from a \"real\" Lord of the Wamphyri! I remember once over - oh, it seems like a million years ago - how Harry Keogh wouldn\u0027t hear of Zek using her talent anywhere near Janos Ferenczy. Janos was a powerful mentalist, too, but according to what Lardis has said about Malinari, Janos couldn\u0027t have held a candle to him] And it might well turn out that Nephran Malinari is our man, that he\u0027s the one we\u0027re dealing with here. It\u0027s unlikely to be Szwart, we\u0027re fairly certain of that, so it has to be either Vavara or Malinari. But if it\u0027s the latter, and if he really is better than Janos ... \u0027Listen, twenty-odd years ago I had a friend called Trevor Jordan. He was E-Branch, and a telepath. Janos Ferenczy caught Trevor spying on him and got into his head - I mean literally! And later, at a distance of some seven hundred miles, Janos was able to invade and even inhabit Jordan\u0027s mind. And just to show us how good he was, he made Jordan put a gun to his own ear and pull the trigger! Now that... is mentalism! \u0026O\u0027But this Nephran Malinari isn\u0027t just another telepath. In his own world, in Starside four hundred years ago, his own kind, the Wamphyri, called him Malinari the Mind. Doesn\u0027t that say it all? Anyway, we\u0027ve learned the legends from Lardis, and the Old Lidesci\u0027s word is good enough for me. And even if it wasn\u0027t... well, I know I\u0027ll never forget the things that Zek showed me on the night she died. That bastard vampire thing, trying its best to leech on her mind.\u0027So I\u0027m asking you, Liz. Please be careful. You... you\u0027re very special, and in my time I\u0027ve lost too many special people. I just need to be sure you fully appreciate the danger. I don\u0027t want you locking on to something - and perhaps receiving something - that you don\u0027t want and can\u0027t get rid of.\u0027That had been some three hours ago, but now...... Trask\u0027s words were still echoing in Liz\u0027s mind when the pilot\u0027s voice climbed a notch in her headset to declare: \u0027We\u0027re going down now, folks. Gladstone next stop. So if yer\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll just radio a pal o\u0027 mine on the ground, tell him to get the beer out o\u0027 the cooler, and slice up a fresh batch o\u0027 sarnies. By the time yer\u0027ve all freshened up, I\u0027ll be done refuelling and we\u0027ll start back. A slightly different route this time, if yer\u0027d like. We can stick more closely to the coast and - \u0027\u0027No,\u0027 Liz interrupted him. Tm sorry, but we\u0027re especially interested in mountains. On the way back, it would suit us just fine if you\u0027d show us some mountains that we haven\u0027t seen yet.\u0027 And then, perhaps a little self-consciously, \u0027Er, sorry to be a nuisance.\u0027The pilot glanced back though his window, looked from face to face, shrugged his shoulders and said, \u0027Suit yerself, Miss, fellers. I\u0027m to accommodate yer as best I can, so whatever yer say is okay with me.\u0027 At which Liz craned her neck and looked for confirmation from David Chung where he sat behind her ... only to find that the locator\u0027s attention, indeed his concentration, seemed rapt on something that no one else could see. With his jaw hanging slack, he gazed as if transfixed eastward, out across the open sea. It lasted for a single moment only, then Chung started as he became aware of Liz\u0027s eyes upon him, the unspoken question that was written in them.His gaze met hers and he half-nodded, half-shrugged, then said, \u0027I... I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t be sure. It was so faint.\u0027They were settling fast towards a small airport. The locator snapped out of it, put his headset on, and asked the pilot, \u0027What\u0027s out there? I mean east, er, the sea?\u0027\u0027Exactly, mate,\u0027 the other\u0027s tinny voice came back, seeming to vibrate as the pitch of the rotor vanes changed to landing mode. \u0027The sea, a handful o\u0027 little rocks, and stretching a thousand miles to the north, the Great Barrier Reef And then a laugh. \u0027Sorry, but all that\u0027s way out o\u0027 our itinerary...\u0027They freshened up, drank ice-cold beer out of glasses dripping with condensation, ate prawn sandwiches and barbecued chicken, and talked while they waited for their pilot to call for them.They were in a private Skytours suite that overlooked the small airport through a soundproof panoramic window. While eating they had watched a handful of planes coming and going, not said too much, been glad of the overhead fan that struggledO OOto waft a stream of warm, sluggish air around the room.OOBut eventually curiosity had got the better of the military men. Liz was aware of it but didn\u0027t find it intrusive, and anyway they were all members of a loose-knit team. And the fact was that apart from Trask\u0027s briefings - and that these men had been ordered to accept all Branch members as voices of authority here - there hadn\u0027t been and could never be a great deal of understanding of E-Branch\u0027s role. Not to disparage the military, but it would have proved extremely difficult for entirely military minds to grasp the concepts, motivations, and operating practices of an ESP-oriented intelligence agency. And, indeed, they weren\u0027t required to. But now, here in the intimacy of a much smaller grouping, these young soldiers had been presented with an opportunity to dig just a little deeper.On the other hand and on behalf of E-Branch, both Liz and Chung were sworn to a modified version of the Official Secrets Act, and so had to be be circumspect in what they revealed.\u0027You\u0027re a psychic, right?\u0027 one of the Warrant Officers, a slim, well-muscled, crew-cut redhead in his early thirties asked of David Chung. \u0027I mean, don\u0027t take offence, but isn\u0027t it a bit strange, using - what do you call it? Parapsychology? - against bloody awful things such as that nest we burned out in the desert?\u0027\u0027No offence taken,\u0027 said Chung. \u0027But you\u0027d do well to remember that I\u0027m the one who found those bloody things out in the desert! And I\u0027ve been dealing with such things on and off - but mercifully more off than on - for some twenty years. Currently, however, we\u0027re definitely on again, and like,most of the others in E-Branch I\u0027m getting past my sell-by date. Oh, we\u0027re recruiting young blood all right, such as Liz here, but the years take their toll. So on a job like this we\u0027re obliged to call in different kinds of \"experts\". We like to be sure there\u0027s plenty of muscle behind the mind.\u0027\u0027Like us?\u0027 said the other.And Chung nodded, smiled, raised an eyebrow and said, \u0027No offence?\u0027\u0027But a psychic? I mean, how can you simply think the location of these creatures? Like, you read their thoughts or something?\u0027And though he was polite up front in his talking to Chung, Liz couldn\u0027t help reading that he was more than a little sceptical. She read one or two other things, too, such as: Never kid a kidder, Mr Chinaman. Old Red isn\u0027t buying it! Red: a nickname no one had used since his teens, and one which he wouldn\u0027t accept from anyone else despite that it fitted him so well and was how he continued to think of himself.So before Chung could answer Liz told herself to hell with the rules and said: \u0027Whether you\u0027re buying it or not, my friend Mr Chung here - who is in fact a fourth-generation Brit, despite that his roots are oriental - isn\u0027t kidding, Red!\u0027The young soldier jerked in his seat, instinctively touched a hand to his crew-cut, and stuttered: \u0027Er, my hair, right?\u0027But Liz shook her head. \u0027Your thoughts/ she replied. \u0027And Red, the next time I walk into a place ahead of you, please try to remember I can\u0027t help how I walk, and find somewhere else to look... okay?\u0027Fuck me!!! thought the other.And Liz said, \u0027No, thanks. I\u0027m spoken for.\u0027\u0027J-Jesus, I\u0027m s-s-sorry!\u0027 the other gasped.\u0027It\u0027s okay/ Liz told him. \u0027But maybe we should change the subject now? And yes, you\u0027re safe: I promise not to peek.\u0027\u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 asked the other soldier, genuinely puzzled.\u0027Nothing much/ Liz told him. \u0027I was reading your friend\u0027s thoughts, that\u0027s all. Yours, too, if you like.\u0027\u0027Oh, really?\u0027 The second W.O. was older and less inquisitive. But he did have something on his mind.\u0027In the chopper/ Liz said, \u0027just as we were landing. You were wondering what was wrong with David. Like me, you noticed the way he was looking out over the sea, his expression.\u0027\u0027You saw that?\u0027 the W.O. said.\u0027No/ said Liz, \u0027I overheard it, \"Joe\" - in your head/And Joe accepted that she had, because they had only ever been introduced as Warrant Officers Bygraves and Davis!\u0027Let me have one of your maps/ Chung said, deciding that Liz had gone far enough. \u0027This area, and small-scale. Covering as much ground as possible. \u0027Red\u0027 Bygraves spread a map on the table, and Chung began poring over it. While he searched he explained: \u0027I\u0027m a kind of bloodhound. It\u0027s nothing weird/ (though infact it was) \u0027just a knack, sort of instinctive. But sometimes I can sense where these things are hanging out. In the helicopter, I got a feeling that there just might be something ... out there!\u0027 He stabbed his index finger at the map, their current location, then drew it in a straight line east and a little north. \u0027In that direction, anyway. And you know, it\u0027s still there, but so very faint ...\u0027 Chung shook his head, narrowed his eyes in a frown. \u0027What we could use, really, is a little triangulation/ \u0027Now that I understand/ said Red. \u0027Let me see the map/They let him jostle into position, watched him point out a location: Sandy Cape on the northern tip of Fraser Island. And: \u0027We can\u0027t ask the pilot to fly us east and out to sea/ he went on, \u0027because that will add air miles and run him low on fuel to get us back to Brisbane. But there\u0027s no reason why he can\u0027t fly us over Fraser Island, which lies south of here. He did suggest a coastal route, right?\u0027 \u0027Good!\u0027 said Chung. \u0027And as soon as we get over the northern tip of the island, I can - well, do my thing, take a bearing north - and see if we come up with something/ . Red looked at Liz. \u0027And you\u0027ll do what? Or does this part include you out?\u0027Now Liz saw the error of saying anything at all. But since it was too late now:\u0027If David senses anything, I\u0027ll try to, well, hitch a ride on his probe/ she said. \u0027But since this looks like a long-distance thing, I really can\u0027t be sure 111 get a reading/And Joe asked Chung: \u0027Did this talent of yours really lead your people to that Gibson Desert nest? I mean, we haven\u0027t seen you around until today - and you weren\u0027t out there - so ... ?\u0027\u0027Bruce Trennier had a very powerful aura/ Chung answered. \u0027But as a comparative newcomer among these creatures - even as a lieutenant - he wasn\u0027t too good at hiding himself away. When he slipped up, myself and some other E-Branch people, we picked him up from London. Since when the rest of them seem to be masking their presence - a kind of mental camouflage, you know? So I came out here to get a little closer to the action. Well, and now we might have found some.\u0027\u0027You picked Trennier up from London?\u0027 Joe said.The locator nodded, and thought, Yes, like a dense bank of jog on a sunny day. Fog that\u0027s there one minute, gone the next. Minasmog! But out loud he only said, \u0027Yes, we did.\u0027To which there was no answer, and the two W.O.s could only look at each other and shake their heads in wonder ...In the other helicopter an hour later, Jake Cutter was lost in his own thoughts, somewhat moodily enjoying the mountain scenery, when Lardis Lidesci reached across the narrow aisle, jogged his elbow and said something.\u0027Um?\u0027 Jake murmured a response: He had long since removed his headset, and so had Lardis.\u0027I said, what\u0027s that?\u0027 the Old Lidesci said again, pointing out of the window on his own side of the aircraft.\u0027Why not ask the pilot?\u0027 Jake grumbled. \u0027How am I to know what something is?\u0027 But, loosening his belt, he stood up, leaned across and looked anyway.lan Goodly was seated in front of Lardis. Feeling the movements, he looked back, saw where the others were looking.They were on the return trip, covering different mountains than on the outward-bound leg. A thousand feet below, a massive geological \u0027wrinkle\u0027 in the Macpherson Range had left a tightly angled dog-leg fold. In the west-facing lee of the fold, a saddle or roughly oblong-shaped false plateau maybe two and a half by four acres in extent stood out in stark contrast to the surrounding heights. For it wasn\u0027t naked rock. Anything but. At an elevation of almost three thousand feet, someone had built ... a small town? No, not a town but a complex of sorts: with gardens, pools, fountains, a monorail, tennis courts, bowling greens, even a small ski-slope up against the mountainside, and terraced chalets to house the guests. The walkways between concentric rows of red-tiled chalet accommodations radiated out from a roughly central location: a circular garden surrounding a great, silver-shining bubble of a structure, with windows on three levels and a smaller dome on top.Lardis was lost for words; he found it too fantastic. But Jake only grunted and said, \u0027You should see Las Vegasf While in his own mind he wondered: A holiday campp A fantastic hotel complex for the jet-setters and beautiful people? Or maybe - \u0027An aerie!\u0027 sighed Lardis. \u0027Now wouldn\u0027t that make a wonderful aerie? Er, without all this sunlight, of course.\u0027The precog was still wearing his headset, and he had been conversing with the pilot. Now he put a hand over the mike and said, \u0027Xanadu, and the centrepiece there ... why, that can only be Kubla Kahn\u0027s pleasure dome! Put on your headsets. The pilot knows some stuffJake and Lardis complied, heard the pilot tail off:\u0027... There were some private homes here, hence the road up the mountain. But after the fire some kind of tycoon bought up the land and built this place. He\u0027s a philanthropist, uses the money from this for other \"good works\", allegedly. Huh! A typical tax gimmick, if you ask me. All of these fat-cat rich bastards are the same. Xanadu, yeah, that\u0027s what it\u0027s called. The dome\u0027s a casino, all three floors of it.\u0027\u0027The fire?\u0027 said Goodly. \u0027You mean the Brisbane Fire?\u0027 \u0027Nah, not the Great Fire,\u0027 said the other. \u0027This was back in \u002797, an earlier El Nino. The place was a tinderbox, and the fire must have started in one of the weekend homes. They were simple timber cabins, holiday homes, you know? Went up like so much kindling.\u0027 \u0027Take her lower, can you?\u0027 The precog was plainly interested.\u0027So what\u0027s on your mind, boss?\u0027 With a chuckle, the pilot leaned his machine into a descending spiral. \u0027You want to wave at the girlies around those pools?\u0027\u0027Er, something like that,\u0027 said Goodly.And certainly the girlies were there, and sun-bronzed fellows, too. There were three pools situated equidistant from the central dome; they glittered like dazzling blue jewels in Mediterranean settings, and were surrounded by low windbreak walls and mosaic-paved sundecks. The sundecks were dotted with chairs and sunbeds. And sure enough, as the chopper circled lower, the girls were sitting up, tilting their mirror-shades at the furnace sky, waving lazy arms at their imagined aerial \u0027admirers\u0027.\u0027That\u0027s low enough/ Lardis muttered, nervously. \u0027The next thing you know, I\u0027ll be swimming!\u0027And the Major said, \u0027Mightn\u0027t we attract a little too much attention?\u0027 He was on the headset and the pilot heard him.\u0027So what\u0027s the problem?\u0027 he inquired. \u0027Are you worried the people who run the place will complain? Nah! It\u0027s good free advertising, and we do this all the time. Tourists who can afford it sometimes take time out after they\u0027ve seen it to come up for a few days\u0027 relaxation - though how anyone with red blood in his veins could relax up here is beyond me!\u0027 Then the precog said, \u0027That ... that\u0027s enough. We\u0027d better get on our way now.\u0027 And there was a certain edge to his piping voice that had Jake looking at him across the aisle. He saw that Goodly\u0027s face was suddenly drawn, and noticed how his hands gripped the armrests of his seat...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-28.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.

Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ.

If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none.
