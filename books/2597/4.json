{"id":97203,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"FirestormLooking at Ben Trask, Jake Cutter found himself wondering what it was about the man. He knew some of it - that Trask was the head of a British Secret Service organization called E-Branch, based in London but with many other branches, affiliations and powerful friends throughout the world - but not everything by any means. One thing seemed certain, however: Ben Trask was a driven man. Moreover, Jake thought it likely that whatever was driving him was the same thing that caused him to look so much older than his years.Not that Trask was young; in fact, he could be anything between fifty-five and sixty years old. But while his mousey hair was streaked with white, his skin pale and his aspect in general aged and maybe even fragile, still the man inside, the mind, soul, and personality - the id itself - was diamond-hard. Jake sensed this, and felt a certain empathy for Trask, felt that he knew him, despite that the man had only recently become a factor in his life. But one hell of a factor!\n For his height of about five-ten, Trask was maybe a couple of pounds overweight. His broad shoulders slumped just a little, his arms tended to dangle, and his expression was usually, well, lugubrious? Or maybe that, too, was as a result of... of what? His loss? For that was the impression you got if you caught him unawares: the feeling that something had gone out of him, leaving him downcast, empty; his green eyes strangely vacant or far away, his face drawn, and his mouth turned down at the corners. As if he\u0027d suffered a loss too great to bear. And Jake thought he knew something of how that felt.On the other hand, if what little Jake had been told about Trask were true, then he might well be misjudging him; Trask\u0027s pain could have its origin in something else entirely. For in a world where the simple truth was becoming increasingly hard to find, it would be no easy thing to possess a mind that couldn\u0027t accept a lie. And that, allegedly, was what Trask was; a human lie-detector.E-Branch; E for ESP. Telepaths, empaths, locators, precogs ... psychos? That\u0027s how Jake had thought of them just five days ago: as raving lunatics. No, as very quiet lunatics. For nary a one of them had actually raved. But that was five days ago, and in between he\u0027d seen some stuff. And anyway who was he to talk? What, Jake Cutter, who went on instantaneous, hundred-mile-long sleep-walking tours in broad daylight, and suspected that someone was hiding in his head?All of these thoughts passing through Jake\u0027s mind as he and Liz followed Trask, Goodly, and Miller - who in turn followed a team of four, armed-to-the-teeth special agents - between the stinking fires and towards the slumping, blazing ruin that had been the main shack. The lone pump had disappeared; now a column of shimmering blue fire roared its fury at the sky as fuel from the subterranean storage tank burned off. And as Trask\u0027s party advanced on the shack, so Miller went prattling on:\u0027Do you think there can ever really be an answer to this, Mr Trask? Good Lord, man.\u0027 But who gave you the authority to do such as this? I mean - Look!\u0027 And his hand flew to his mouth. \u0027A b-b-body!\u0027he stammered. \u0027For God\u0027s sake! A cindered body.\"\n In the lee of a clump of hip-high boulders where the blackened, smoking skeletons of cactuses and other once-hardy plants oozed bubbling sap, the clean-up squad had missed something. It was an arm and a hand, protruding from the molten mess of vegetation like a root among all the other exposed roots.\n Obviously someone had tried to escape the fire by diving for cover in the foliage ... any port in a firestorm.Or rather it lad been an arm and a hand. Now it was a smoking black twig-thing with four lesser twiglets and the remains of an opposing thumb. Yet even now it was twitching, vibrating, showing signs of impossible life, and the vile soup within the nest of rocks was heaving and bubbling.\u0027You there - you missed something/ Trask called out. And one of the specialists came back with his flame-thrower, playing its bright yellow lance on the shuddering mess until it seethed into a black liquid slop.In the meantime, Miller had been sick. Trask looked unemotionally at the little fat man where he stood trembling, holding a handkerchief to his mouth, and said, \u0027Best if you stay here.\u0027 And to Liz and Jake, \u0027You two keep Mr Miller company. But make sure he gets a good look at it if... if anything happens.\u0027 He turned away, moved off with lan Goodly. Both of them were equipped with vicious-looking machine-pistols.\u0027Oh my God!\u0027 Miller moaned, hanging half-suspended between Jake and Liz, swaying from side to side. \u0027Oh my good God! Doesn\u0027t the man have a heart? I mean, doesn\u0027t he feel anything for these poor p-p-people?\u0027\u0027Ben Trask is all heart,\u0027 Liz told him. \u0027And yes, he feels a great deal for people, for every man, woman and child of us. For our entire - and entirely human - race. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here. Because these creatures aren\u0027t human, not any longer ...\u0027But Miller was bending over, being sick again, and Jake had got behind him, was holding on to make sure he didn\u0027t fall face down in it.\n The fires were burning lower now, and the night was creeping in again. Long shadows danced like demons, turning the barren rock ledge into a scene from Dante\u0027s Inferno. Near the main shack the column of flame from the underground tank shrank down into itself, issued a final muffled blast, and then became a fireball that rolled like a living thing up the face of the cliff.\n Along the foot of the knoll, a second half-team of agents had killed the fire at the shack with the cage and gone inside to explore the secondary mine shaft. While fifty feet away from the main shack - which continued to burn, sending a column of smoke and the occasional lick of red and orange fire into the night sky - Trask brought his team to a halt.\u0027How about it?\u0027 He shouted at Goodly over the crackle of burning brush and scorched timbers. \u0027What do you think? Do we burn him out?\u0027Not him, them! Liz wanted to yell, but Goodly was already doing it for her. \u0027There\u0027s more than just him, Ben,\u0027 the precog\u0027s piping voice, carried on gusts of hot smoke.\u0027But we can handle them?\u0027 Trask seemed undeterred. Goodly shrugged and said, \u0027I\u0027m not forecasting any casualties, if that\u0027s what you mean. But it won\u0027t be very pretty.\u0027\u0027It never is,\u0027 Trask told him. He came to a decision, nodded, turned and called for Liz. \u0027Tell them we\u0027re going to bring the whole damn\u0027 place down around their ears ... and tell him he isn\u0027t getting out alive. I want you to taunt the bastard/\u0027\u0027But... do you think that he\u0027ll hear me?\u0027 Liz seemed dubious, unsure of herself. \u0027I mean, I\u0027m only half a telepath. I can receive but not send, and - \u0027\u0027We can\u0027t be sure about that,\u0027 Trask cut her off. \u0027That\u0027s one of the things we\u0027re here to find out. But we know your talent isn\u0027t fully developed yet, and just because you can\u0027t send to a human telepath doesn\u0027t mean Trennier won\u0027t hear you. He\u0027s in there, a vampire, and these things have skills of their own. Maybe this will give us some indication of what to expect from you when your talent is fully developed.\u0027Liz gave an answering nod, moved forward. And Miller stood up a little straighter and asked Jake: \u0027Who ... who is he talking about? And how can that girl talk to someone in there?\u0027\n \u0027Just take it for granted she can,\u0027 Jake answered, despite that he wasn\u0027t too sure himself.\n And now Liz was concentrating, concentrating, sending her42thoughts into the main shaft, its entrance a smoking black hole glimpsed beyond the skeletal facade of the shack. There were no true telepaths on the team this time out, no one to \u0027hear\u0027 her or even suspect that she was at work. But her thoughts - which weren\u0027t intended for the minds of common men - went out anyway:We\u0027re coming for you, Eruce Trennier, she sent. And if you think that what you\u0027ve seen so far is hot stuff, wait till you see how hot it can really oet! We have grenades that will bring the roof down on you and your thralls, burying you forever like fossils in the earth, and thermite bombs to melt the rocks into permanent cocoons for your molten bones. You\u0027re trapped, and no way out. So stay right where you are, hiding your face from the sun, and do your best to enjoy what little you have left of the rotten, parasitic half-life you call existence ...It was, of course, a taunt, a challenge, and coming from a woman would be seen as even more of an insult. If Trennier answered, Liz didn\u0027t hear him. What she did hear, or more properly feel, was a sudden silence. A mental silence, a psychic serenity. Or was it more properly a sullen silence, the calm before the storm? lan Goodly confirmed that last with his piped warning: \u0027They\u0027re coming.\u0027\u0027How many?\u0027 As the combat-suited men fanned out a little, Trask swung his ugly-looking weapon up into the ready position and cocked it. Goodly followed suit, narrowing his eyes as his mind read the future\u0027s secrets.He saw men staggering, crumpling to their knees, bursting into flames! Three of them. And he saw one other - more than a man, an animal, a Thing - leaping headlong to the attack! And:\n \u0027Three of them,\u0027 he yelped. \u0027On their way to hell. And one other who looks like he was born there! That\u0027ll be Bruce Trennier. And Ben, they\u0027re coming now!\u0027\n \u0027Are they armed?\u0027 Trask snapped.\u0027No,\u0027 Goodly piped. \u0027But... do they need to be?\u0027\n The first three came like moon-shadows: dark and fleeting, seeming to flow with the wreathing smoke, out of the shack and into the open, so that Trask and Goodly could scarcely be sure what they were firing at - but they fired anyway. And in a matter of moments the scene became chaotic.The nightmarish figures firmed into being as lethal silver bullets found their targets. They had been loping, flowing forwards with their arms and hands reaching, but now were brought up short in the stutter of gunfire, snapped upright and hurled backwards. The feral yellow eyes of the central figure turned red as blood - overflowed with blood - in the instant that the back of his head exploded in a crimson spray. He slumped, went to his knees and burst into flames as the agent with the flame-thrower found the range and licked him with a tongue of cleansing fire. There on his knees, with his head half blown away, the vampire burned like a giant candle.But astonishingly the other thralls recovered and came on. And driving them with the sheer force of his presence, flowing like a vast inkblot immediately behind them, came the last and the worst of them. Their master.The two in front were Trennier\u0027s shields ... he cared nothing for them or their undead existence... his leech was intent on only one thing: its own survival. And for the leech to survive its host must survive, too. But Ben Trask had other ideas.\u0027lan, their legs!\u0027 he was shouting. \u0027You men, aim at their legs - smash their bones - cut the bastards down!\u0027 He kept firing, his machine-pistol a stammering, jerking mad thing in his hands; Goodly\u0027s too, as he followed his leader\u0027s example. Likewise from the flanks: a stream of gunfire that turned the night to an uproar as the weapons of the squad spat silver death.\n Yet still the three came on. They seemed to float, drifting forwards in that dreadful, dreamlike, kaleidoscopic or strobing stop-motion manner of the vampire. It was hypnotic; it appeared to be slow-motion, but in fact was lightning fasti And now they were only thirty to forty feet away. At which Trask gave a nod to one of his men on the right flank. And:\n \u0027Down!\u0027 he shouted, as the man armed and lobbed a grenade. Jake was young and fast, and his military training came in44handy; Liz had already thrown herself flat when he took Miller off his feet, covering him with his own body. Then the brilliant flash, and a bang that echoed back from the valley walls.The entire squad was on the deck; cordite stench came drifting, and with it the mewling of something utterly alien. Take looked up, saw Trask getting to his feet and offering his hand to Goodly. But in front of the wrecked, smouldering shack: the scene was unbelievable.One crumpled figure, a hump of broken flesh, shuddered and steamed in the flickering firelight. Another was sitting there, just a trunk with no arms. Smoke curled from his hair; his yellow eyes were dim, rolling vacantly in their orbits. But Trennier was still on his feet. And Jake thought:\u0026#8226; This is the \u0027old man/ Bruce. A pitiful wreck of a man was what we saw, but this was the reality!With his clothing in rags, blood-spattered, his awful face sliced open to the bone, still Trennier stumbled forward. Crying out his agony he came on, hands like claws reaching, blood spurting from his gums as his jaws cracked open, and open, and open! His eyes were scarlet... his great ears curved and scalloped like the wings of a bat... and those teeth, scything up through his riven gums!The man with the flame-thrower was on the ground. His weapon lay where he\u0027d let it fall. Trask grabbed it up. And still Trennier came on, weaving towards Liz, reaching for her where she\u0027d managed to get to her knees. \u0027You,\u0027 the thing rumbled, spitting blood. He seemed dazed; his flickering forked tongue licked tattered lips; finally his eyes focussed and he smiled a monstrous smile. \u0027You, woman ... thought-caster? You thought to fool me - you even taunted me. Very well, and so you\u0027ll die with me!\u0027\n Jake was up on his feet now, and Miller was on his fat backside, scrabbling away from the horror for all he was worth. But Trennier was concentrating on Liz! He was almost upon her, his oh-so-long hands dripping blood as they reached for her!\n Jake caught her round the waist and ran with her, made only two or three paces before tripping and falling. But they didn\u0027t hit the ground. No, for it was as if they fell in slow motion, and in Jake\u0027s mind a voice saying: Now! The numbers - the formula! Read it! Use it! Rut his own voice, or some other\u0027s?Numbers rolled on the screen of Jake\u0027s mind ... an endless mathematical progression displaying itself on his brain\u0027s computer. Numbers, yes, and he knew them - or someone did! Still holding on to Liz, still falling, Jake (or the unseen, unknown someone) stopped the numbers at a certain combination, an impossible formula that at once formed into a door.They tumbled through it, into a place of negative gravity, a place of nothing at all, and in another moment - or perhaps no time at all - through a second door, and only then hit the ground. And rolling in the dust full fifty feet away from where they had been, so Jake heard Peter Miller babbling his terror, Trask\u0027s cry of triumph or vengeance or both, and the unmistakable roar of the flame-thrower.Even at that distance, still Jake and Liz felt something of the heat and drew back from it, and a moment later spied Miller where he came crying like a child, dragging his fat body along the scorched earth. Then they looked back.Trennier danced there: the hideous, agonized dance of the true death. Vampire that he was, he beat his arms and screamed his wrath. Or was the awful sound something else? Like the hissing and popping of air- or gas-filled body-cavities when live lobsters are dropped in the pot? Maybe it was the nerve-rending fire-screech of the flame-thrower, or perhaps a mixture of both? Jake wasn\u0027t sure, couldn\u0027t rightly say. He didn\u0027t see how Trennier could scream - not in the airless inferno that surrounded his melting body.\n His stumbling dance went on for many a long second, there in the heart of that blue-white blast of superheated chemicals, until finally he succumbed. But the Thing inside him fought on - or at any rate caused Trennier to fight on - for a while longer yet. And that was the proof, the undeniable proof, of just how long he had been a vampire.For as his body began to melt and his legs gave way, letting him collapse onto his backside, so at last his metamorphic flesh answered the call of his vampire nature. It was one last, desperate attempt by Trennier\u0027s leech to escape the fire - by using his altered flesh and liquids to damp down the flames.His scraps of clothing had drifted free of his blackened body to waft aloft on the vile updraught. Now his fingers elongated into writhing worms, and his stomach bulged and burst into a nest of lashing purple tentacles. And all of these appendages were like penises that pissed into the fire, but uselessly. For this was a fire they couldn\u0027t put out. Only Ben Trask could do that, and he wouldn\u0027t until there was nothing left to burn. Or nothing left that could be considered injurious, anyway. Or at least until his weapon ran out of fuel.But now the members of the other half-team were back from the ruins of the lesser shack. One of them had a flame-thrower; turning his liquid fire on the vampire and his fallen thralls, he finished what Trask had started ...Eventually it was over, and Trask wanted to know:\u0027Were there no weapons? Why didn\u0027t they have weapons?\u0027 Now that it was done he seemed half-mazed, drained, as if there had been fires in him also, and they, too, were now extinguished. \u0027Weapons?\u0027 The second team\u0027s leader answered him. \u0027There\u0027s a small armoury in the mine shaft behind the lesser shack! Maybe they didn\u0027t think they\u0027d need guns, against just two humans. Anyway, we\u0027ve set charges well back inside the mine shaft. Thermite, too. When that blows, the whole place will go with it. If there\u0027s anything still in there, it won\u0027t be getting out.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Trask gave himself a shake and took a deep breath. And to the leader of the first team: \u0027Let\u0027s get to work on this end, too. I want the main shaft rigged good and deep. Okay, gentlemen, let\u0027s move it. The night\u0027s not over yet...\u0027 But it soon would be. By then, too, Trask would be his old self again, hard and businesslike. At least on the surface ...Within the hour the charges were triggered. The ground trembled underfoot, and the deep rumble of man-made thunder sounded from the mouths of the mine shafts. And even though the team\u0027s members were standing safely back from the face of the knoll, still they felt the flurry of hot air that rushed out of those night-dark pits, and smelled stenches other than those of chemicals.Then there were clouds of dust, erupting as from blowholes, as the shafts gave way to countless tons of solid rock and lesser debris that came avalanching from on high. But even then it wasn\u0027t quite over, for now the effect of the thermite was seen: white gases escaping in high-pressure jets, and smoking liquid that filled even the smallest crevices, running over the rocks to seal them.Finally someone said, \u0027In there, right now, it will be much like a blast furnace - the entire mine, cooking itself. I would sooner take my chances in a cellar in World War Two Dresden than in there!\u0027To which no one gave argument, or even made reply...\n The back-up vehicles started to arrive and secondary clean-up could now commence. An old man, apparently plagued by rheumatism, hobbled here and there, examining the ashes of fires that were already cooling. Like Trask and Goodly, he wasn\u0027t especially protected; he wasn\u0027t wearing a gas mask, seemed to breathe freely (which indicated the absence of nose-plugs), and didn\u0027t appear too concerned with contamination. His only weapons were a wicked-looking machete, hanging in its sheath under his left arm, and an antiquated hand-fashioned crossbow. While this final phase of the operation got under way, Jake and Liz waited for Trask\u0027s instructions. By no means fully recovered from the night\u0027s events - lost in private and personal thoughts - they leaned against the side of the Land Rover where Jake had driven it back up onto the elevated shelf to clear the way for the articulated ops vehicle. And they were mainly silent.\n But finally Jake shook off his mood of introspection - a worrying, morbid train of thought where he questioned his sanity and pondered the seeming unreality of certain things that had happened and were continuing to happen to him - and fixed his attention on the hobbling old man, who apparently had more than a little authority here. Limping between the flame-thrower teams, he appeared to be pointing out areas they had missed in their \u0027scorched earth\u0027 mission.\u0027Burn here,\u0027 Jake heard him growling over the hiss and roar of searing lances of fire. \u0027And over there, too. Oh, it\u0027s charred, I\u0027ll grant you that, but charred isn\u0027t enough. It must be burned right through. Then, when it\u0027s smoke and ashes drifting on the wind ... then it\u0027s done with. Not before.\u0027His accent was strange, hard to place: European Mediterranean area, though, definitely. Italy, Sicily, Romania? There was something of a Romance language in it, anyway. But in fact Jake couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. Or rather, his conclusion was too \u0027mundane\u0027 in the literary sense of the word.\u0027Who is he?\u0027 he asked Liz. \u0027The old boy there? Look at him. He reminds me of nothing so much as a bloodhound... the way he stops every now and then to sniff the night air! The only thing / can smell is smoke and fire ... and death. And what about his clothing? Just what does he think he is: some kind of frontiersman out of the Wild West?\u0027\n And for a fact the old man might well have been a frontiersman - and was, of sorts - but from a wilder west than any Jake might have imagined.\n \u0027You know,\u0027 Jake went on, \u0027I got the impression that there was something of the Romany, something Gypsyish about the vampire, Bruce Trennier? Well, now I have the same kind of feeling about this fellow. Hell, he even jingles when he moves!\u0027But the oldster had spotted them even as Jake spoke, and he came hobbling in their direction. Ben Trask came, too; probably to make introductions, Jake thought. And meanwhile Liz was answering at least one of his queries:\u0027You said he reminded you of a bloodhound,\u0027 she said. \u0027And you\u0027re just about right. A human bloodhound is exactly what he is. What you\u0027ve seen tonight, he\u0027s seen so many times he can\u0027t count them. So I\u0027ve gathered, anyway. His name is Lardis, sometimes called the Old Lidesci/\u0027Liz,\u0027 the old fellow nodded his greeting and smiled a gaptoothed smile ... but in the next moment he was frowning, stepping closer, turning his head on one side to look up into Liz\u0027s face. Then: \u0027Huhl\u0027he grunted, spitting in the dirt. \u0027No plugs.\u0027 What, and are you imp - imper - er, imperv...\u0027 \u0027Impervious?\u0027 she helped him out.\u0027Yes!\u0027 he snapped, pointing an accusing finger at her. \u0027And you, too!\u0027 He turned to Jake. \u0027Cutter, is it? Jake Cutter?\u0027\u0027We were wearing plugs,\u0027 Jake answered. \u0027Then we got involved in a lot of activity. My plugs were knocked out of me, but Liz had hers to the end. And anyway, who the hell - ?\u0027\u0027Decon ...I\u0027 the other abruptly cut him short. \u0027Er, decontam - contain...\u0027\u0027 - Decontamination,\u0027 Liz said.\u0027Right!\u0027the old man snapped, jerking his thumb in the direction of the command truck. \u0027Both of you. Now!\u0027\u0027Who on earth - ?\u0027 Jake started again. But by then Ben Trask was there to stop him.\n \u0027Jake Cutter,\u0027 Trask said, \u0027this is Lardis Lidesci. I heard you asking who on earth? Well, nobody on Earth, actually. Originally he\u0027s from ... oh, a different place entirely.\u0027 Trask had almost let something drop, stopped himself at the last moment. \u0027Lardis was in the Greek Islands with another team/ he changed the subject, \u0027When they didn\u0027t find what they were looking for, I asked that he be sent here. He came in this afternoon by chopper from Perth.\u0027\n And turning to the Old Lidesci, he said \u0027Well? How about it?\u0027\n Obviously there was something between the two of them that Jake and Liz weren\u0027t privy to.\n \u0027Him?\u0027 Lardis looked at Jake, frowned, gave a shrug. \u0027Can\u0027t say. Could be, I suppose. Fit and young ... and stubborn! Won\u0027t listen to good advice, and doesn\u0027t respect his elders too much, either! Makes him a funny choice if you ask me. But if it\u0027s so it\u0027s so, and who are we to fathom the ways of the Necroscope?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing certain, then?\u0027 Trask seemed disappointed.Lardis shrugged again, and said, \u0027Well, the proof could be right here in the slime and the stink where these bastards burned ... that\u0027s if you really want to test your theory?\u0027Trask knew what Lardis meant even if Jake didn\u0027t. He shook his head, said: \u0027No, he\u0027s not ready for that yet. And probably not for quite some time to come.\u0027\n Jake had been studying Lardis. The Old Lidesci was short, barrel-bodied, almost apelike in the great length of his arms. His lank black hair, beginning to grey now, framed a leathery, weather-beaten face with a flattened nose that sat uncomfortably over a mouth that was missing too many teeth. As for the ones that remained: they were uneven and stained as old ivory. But under shaggy eyebrows, Lardis\u0027s dark brown eyes glittered his mind\u0027s agility, denying the encroaching infirmities of his body. Jake guessed he\u0027d been a leader, and rightly so.\n If Jake examined Lardis Lidesci, it was certainly no less of an inspection that the old man was giving him. And suddenly, feeling uncomfortable, Jake went on the defensive. Frowning, he said, \u0027I wish you\u0027d talk to me, you two, instead of about me! I mean, you were talking about me, weren\u0027t you?\u0027\u0027About you and about someone else,\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027We\u0027re talking about the fellow that you think - and that we think - might be in your head. Talking about a man called Harry Keogh.\u0027\u0027I never heard of him,\u0027 said Jake, but wondered if in fact he had. The name did seem somehow familiar ... and felt familiar, too, in a weird sort of way. Which only served to confuse him and make him angry. \u0027Anyway, what has he to do with me?\u0027Trask rubbed his chin, said, \u0027There\u0027s something he used to do that... well, that you seem to do, too. When Liz was under threat,you... you moved her away from Trennier. And I know I don\u0027t need to remind you that that\u0027s how you first came to our attention. It\u0027s how you brought yourself to our attention: by moving in on us.\u0027 Jake shook his head. \u0027That wasn\u0027t deliberate/ he said. \u0027I mean, I didn\u0027t have anything to do with it. It wasn\u0027t me.\u0027 \u0027Exactly,\u0027 Trask told him.Jake frowned again. \u0027I don\u0027t see the connection.\u0027 \u0027Neither do we,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027Not just yet. But if there is one, we\u0027re going to find out about it.\u0027 His eyes were speculative, bright with some strange emotion - hope, perhaps? - where they studied Jake\u0027s face ... But then he shrugged it off and said, \u0027Meanwhile Lardis is right. Decontamination time for you two. And I do mean right now.\u0027And Liz and Jake both knew enough - they had seen enough now - not to argue; and so headed for the command vehicle ...When they had left:\u0027I missed it/ the Old Lidesci spoke to Trask. \u0027But he did actually do it, then, this Jake? He used the Mobius Continuum?\u0027Trask nodded. \u0027And that makes three times now that we know of.\u0027\u0027Then we must accept that he is what he is/ Lardis shrugged. \u0027It seems obvious to me.\u0027\u0027And I wish it seemed as obvious to me/ said Trask. \u0027It\u0027s just that I don\u0027t like the coincidence - that at a time such as this he turns up.\u0027\u0027But what better time?\u0027 Lardis asked him.\u0027Or what worse?\u0027 Trask countered. \u0027The point is, we know what he might be, but we don\u0027t know what he is. The only thing I know for sure, it isn\u0027t an act. He really doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on/\u0027And you haven\u0027t told him?\u0027\n \u0027What do you want me to tell him, Lardis? That part of him has been occupied by someone who talks to dead people? Someone who can even call the dead up out of the earth, to walk again?\n Someone who, at the end of \"life as we know it,\" was himself a vampire - and not only him but two of his sons, too? Should I tell him that in Starside, in your world, one of Harry Keogh\u0027s sons was a Lord of the Wamphyri, while another was The Dweller, a werewolf? And if Jake didn\u0027t think I was a madman, if he actually believed me, what then?\u0027\n Again Lardis\u0027s shrug. But then, perhaps grudgingly: \u0027I see what you mean/ he growled. \u0027If it was me, I\u0027d run like all the devils of hell were after me!\u0027\u0027And so might he/ Trask nodded. \u0027And in the Mobius Continuum, he can run a very long way. We can\u0027t afford that, can\u0027t afford to lose him. Which is why we\u0027ll just let this thing develop for a while, and see what happens ...\u0027And some little distance away:As Jake and Liz passed a patch of blackened, tarry ground, and a slumped mound that still gave off the stench of roasting flesh:\u0027What?\u0027 Jake paused, and his face was very pale. \u0027What? Do you hear that, those screams? Jesus, what the hell is that?\u0027 He turned in a circle, looked all about, but no one was there.For a moment Liz said nothing. She had heard nothing and couldn\u0027t imagine what he was talking about - or maybe she could but didn\u0027t want to. But it was plain to see that Jake was badly shaken. \u0027Screams?\u0027 she said. \u0027The hiss and sputter of sap, perhaps, boiling out of a scorched branch?\u0027\u0027Well, maybe/ Jake shuddered. \u0027Maybe/\n But he really didn\u0027t think so. What he knew he\u0027d heard had sounded much more like the screaming soul of a sinner, roasting in his own private hell. Or perhaps someone shrieking his final denial from a. world beyond the flames, a world beyond life.\n And the bubbling patch of scorched earth continued to give off steam and smoke ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-4.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \n Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \n If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \n But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire. He\u0027s got to start thinking about the future--or he won\u0027t have one!\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:57 PM"}}
