{"id":97228,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"PART FOUR\n The Hell Of It\n CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\n Here Be VampiresThat evening at the safe house, when Trask\u0027s people had eaten, he got them together in the Ops Room to debrief them and start them working on the correlation of their findings. For he knew by then that they had been partially successful - or at least that they\u0027d detected something out of the ordinary - and that a lot might soon depend on their observations.For instance, the military contingent: it was most likely that the siting of the SAS back-up teams would be based on the as yet unproven suspicions or \u0027hunches\u0027 of Trask\u0027s espers. And in just two days\u0027 time those men and vehicles would start arriving and moving into harbour areas whose locations were as yet undecided. Time was of the essence.After Trask had settled his people down, David Chung described his temporary contact with something during the landing at Gladstone, and went on to talk about the system of triangulation that they had devised.\u0027Taking Gladstone as the centre of a clock face,\u0027 the locator said, \u0027the first reading would see the minute hand at some thirteen minutes past the hour, or a few degrees north of east. As for the second reading, over Sandy Cape, that would be about twelve and a half minutes before the hour, or north-west.\u0027\n Chung stood before an illuminated wall map of the area and used his index finger to point out the coordinates, then traced the directional lines to their junction some sixty miles out in the open sea. \u0027Which puts it - whatever it is - right there/ he said. But staring at the map, he could only offer a baffled shrug. \u0027The last place on Earth that we\u0027d expect to find a vampire or vampires. Right in the middle of an ocean, with nothing but water and lots, I mean lots of sunlight, for miles around!\u0027\u0027But you got readings,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027You got mindsmog. So, how do you explain it?\u0027The locator looked at him, frowned and said. \u0027Explain it? But if it wasn\u0027t for Liz here I\u0027d probably simply ignore it! A glitch, something out of kilter in my head ... a headache? The evidence of the map, the location, it\u0027s all against us. I mean, what would a vampire be doing out there? Also, we know that in the past we\u0027ve puzzled over similar effects from other espers, from talents outside E-Branch giving off vibes they don\u0027t even know they\u0027ve got! So but for Liz I\u0027d probably settle for someone on a ship out there - maybe a cruise liner? - using precognition to place bets in the casino, or maybe telekinesis to drop the ball on his numbers at roulette. Someone who\u0027s extraordinarily \"lucky,\" who doesn\u0027t even know he has a skill - who thinks he has a \"system\" - but who\u0027s nevertheless been banned from half a dozen mainland casinos. That\u0027s what I\u0027d be tempted to think, except ...\u0027 He paused and looked at Liz. \u0027Liz doesn\u0027t think so. But there again, no matter what anyone thinks, nothing can change the fact that it\u0027s sixty miles out to sea.\u0027\n Trask said, \u0027But so were those Russian nuclear submarines, and you haven\u0027t been wrong about those. And I remember the time when a certain Jianni Lazarides had just such a ship, The Lazarus, out on the Mediterranean. Yes, but his real name was Janos Ferenczy! He was Wamphyri, too, one of the very worst. And remember: just because there\u0027s a lot of sunlight, it doesn\u0027t mean our man has to go out in it.\u0027\n He turned to Liz. \u0027David says it might be nothing. But he also says you don\u0027t think so. So what do you think?\u0027Liz looked anxiously from face to face, bit her lip, and said,\u0027Ben, are we right to place this much faith in my talent right now? I mean, at that kind of range, riding David\u0027s probe ... I could easily be mistaken. I\u0027m not really sure that - \u0027\u0027No, no, no!\u0027 Trask cut in, waving his hand dismissively, impatiently. \u0027Just tell us what you got and let us try to figure it out. It isn\u0027t the first time we\u0027ve done this, Liz. And it isn\u0027t as if we\u0027re vying with one another to see who will be first to find these damned things! But while no shame attaches to being in error, still we do have to find them. Which means anything is better then nothing. So whatever it was you sensed out there, let\u0027s have it.\u0027Liz, Trask and Chung were on their feet; the rest of the team were seated. And now Liz sat down, too, and thought about it for a moment. Casting her mind back, she asked herself exactly what it was that she had experienced when the locator took his second reading from the helicopter as it circled high over Sandy Cape.\n Chung sjace - Us slightly damp skin gleaming a pale yellow, his nostrils pinched, eyes slanted more than usual in deep concentration - gazing out of his window, north-west at the distant curve of the world, the horizon, the sea\u0027s wide expanse.\n Then his gaze becoming a vacant stare, and his eyes almost glazing over as his mind ... as his mind went out!No, not his mind but a probe. And Liz Merrick a part of it - riding it like a carrier wave - sharing telepathically in the emptiness of the locator\u0027s search, his far-flung probing of the psychic void ... or what should be a void!But there was something there - faint, so very faint, but definitely there - and she felt it like ... like an emotion as opposed to a conversation. Like something spiritual, or lacking in spirit. For it was shivery cold, this thing, where it walked on her spine with icy feet. And now she knew its name.\u0027Well?\u0027 Trask was leaning over her. And:\u0027Fear!\u0027 Liz blurted it out. \u0027I felt fear!\u0027The look on her face; her great green eyes wide in sudden knowledge where they stared into his ... and Trask took a pace back from her. \u0027You were afraid?\u0027\u0027Not me, no,\u0027 Liz shook her head. \u0027He, they - whoever they\n were - were afraid. That\u0027s what it was, Ben: terror, gnawing at them, eating their hearts out.\u0027 \u0027Them?\u0027\u0027More than one, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\u0027Uncertain a moment ago, and now you\u0027re sure?\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027I just wasn\u0027t willing to believe that there could ever be such hopelessness, such utterly black despair. I suppose I thought it was the emptiness, the psychic void before David\u0027s probe found - well, whoever they are - and that the fear was in fact mine. But now ...\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027Again she shook her head, searched for words. \u0027I know that I, personally, have never been that afraid - that I couldn\u0027t be that afraid - unless something happened to cause me to lose all hope, all faith/Trask nodded grimly. \u0027In short, unless you\u0027d been vampirizedf \u0027I... I don\u0027t know. I imagine so.\u0027But now Trask took a different tack. \u0027Or could it possibly have been fear of discovery? Had someone detected David\u0027s probe and reacted to it?\u0027Liz shook her head. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so. It was simply -or not so simply - an aura of overwhelming doom.\u0027\u0027Good!\u0027 Trask grunted. \u0027And on both counts. One, that you weren\u0027t detected. And two, that therefore whoever it was couldn\u0027t have been afraid of you. But they were afraid, and I think we can all imagine of what.\u0027He looked up from Liz, from face to face around the room, and paused at Lardis Lidesci.And Lardis said, \"Thralls. These were thralls, and fairly recent. Thralls who don\u0027t have much contact with their master, but who know he\u0027s there nevertheless. Aye, and they have every right to fear him!\u0027\n \u0027Another nest,\u0027 Trask nodded. \u0027Why not? It\u0027s entirely possible. Then he frowned. \u0027But out at sea?\u0027 \u0027My point exactly/ said Chung ...\n \u0027Maps/ Trask said, turning to Jimmy Harvey where he sat at a keyboard. \u0027Jimmy, see if the computer has an even smaller-scale map of that area, and blow it up on the wall there/\u0027I\u0027ve been working on it/ said the other, tapping a key. \u0027Consider it done/The wall screen turned blue, if not entirely blue. For in the specified area there were the dotted outlines of reefs and other irregular shapes: islands or islets, and a legend identifying them as Heron Island and the Bunker and Capricorn groups, the latter because they lay on or close to the Tropic of Capricorn. Other lettering at the top of the map said that this was The Capricornia Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.And very quietly, Trask said, \u0027So, not necessarily a ship after all/But, looking sick, the locator David Chung could only shake his head and remark, \u0027What a fool he is who has no faith in his own God-given skills!\u0027Trask might have denied it, but lan Goodly beat him to it. \u0027Not at all/ the precog said. \u0027When we use talents like these, it\u0027s against nature. I mean, even we appreciate that what we\u0027re doing isn\u0027t, well, mundane. Is it any wonder we\u0027re sceptical of our results? Or that we occasionally fail to see their significance?\u0027And then Trask said, \u0027You\u0027re right, lan, and I was on the point of making much the same remark. But as I\u0027ve already said, this isn\u0027t a skills contest. How we get there doesn\u0027t matter a damn, only that we get there. Where these monsters are concerned, the end always justifies the means. Any means/\n \u0027Huh!\u0027 said Lardis. \u0027And in Starside, whenever a man ascends to a vampire Lord and becomes Wamphyri, they have much the same saying - it\u0027s not the route but the getting there. In that respect, and except that their evil has been made ten times as great, these monsters are much like men, you know/\n \u0027Because they were men/ said Trask. \u0027And God knows we\u0027re none of us pure. Very well, now let\u0027s get on - but as soon as we\u0027re done here I want the Duty Officer to contact our aide in Prime\n Minister Blackmore\u0027s office. We need authority for liaison with someone high in the administration of the reef marine park. We need to know who or what is out there on those islets in the Bunker and Capricorn groups ...\u0027 A moment\u0027s pause and he turned to Goodly:lan, you and Lardis were in the other chopper party. And just like David here I know you, too, have a problem. Time now to have it out in the open, get it cleared up.\u0027The precog stood up, tossed a pamphlet attached to a tourist map onto the table. \u0027I picked this up at the Skytours helipad,\u0027 he said. It\u0027s a freebie: a give-away route map into the Macpherson Mountains, and a colour brochure describing the wonders and benefits of the Xanadu health and pleasure resort. But that\u0027s not all I picked up. There was - or I should say there may have been - something else, when we flew over the place.\u0027Sitting at the table (feeling more than a little useless, and wondering what he was doing here), Jake remembered the odd, strained look on the precog\u0027s face - the way his hands gripped his seat\u0027s armrests - after they\u0027d descended to have a closer look at the resort. And now his interest focussed more definitely on Goodly as he saw once again the same nervous tension in the man\u0027s face and attitude.\u0027The thing is,\u0027 Goodly went on, \u0027I have precisely the same problem as David. The location: all that unhampered sunlight. I just can\u0027t see how the kind of creature we\u0027re looking for could exist up there ... if that\u0027s what it was about.\u0027 Seeing Trask\u0027s face, he held up a hand placatingly. \u0027Yes, all right, I promise I will get on with it. But there are complications ...\n \u0027First: as we were descending toward the place, so that we could get a better look at it, our pilot/tour-guide mentioned a fire that occurred during the El Nino back in 1997. And I found some of his descriptions vivid and perhaps evocative: the place was like a tinderbox ... it went up like so much kindling, et cetera.\n \u0027Also, while we\u0027ve been here I\u0027ve heard quite a lot of talk about the Great Fire of Brisbane, and what with this awful heat and all - \u0027\n \u0027You saw a fire?\u0027 Trask cut in.\n Goodly nodded. \u0027But I didn\u0027t see its cause, and I couldn\u0027t tell when it was happening. I mean, it could have been a mental response to what the pilot had said. For example, when someone says \"do you remember\" this or that other thing, you are made automatically to see it, relive it, in your mind\u0027s eye. Do you see? It could be that our pilot had evoked just such a response in me. And Ben, if this was one of my things, then it was only the very briefest glimpse. Smoke, and leaping flames ... gouts of yellow fire roiling up to a night sky, and a full moon hanging there ... and someone shouting, \"To me, to me!\"\u0027\n Listening to him, Trask displayed a kind of amazement, as if he\u0027d only just realized something that should have been obvious for a long time. \u0027How long have I known you?\u0027 he said. \u0027It sometimes seems that I\u0027ve known you forever. And yet I\u0027ve never thought to ask you - do you sometimes see the past?\u0027The precog raised an eyebrow, said, \u0027I remember the past, just like anyone else.\u0027 And then a wry chuckle. \u0027It\u0027s just that I sometimes remember the future, too!\u0027 But he was serious again in a moment. \u0027That\u0027s what we have to consider, Ben. The future. And we know just how devious that can be - or is it perhaps my talent that\u0027s devious? I\u0027ve never been able to figure it out.\u0027\u0027Okay,\u0027 said the other, \u0027so you don\u0027t know whether it was the past or the future. It\u0027s just one of those times when your talent leaves you in doubt. But there\u0027s one clue, at least.\u0027\u0027Oh?\u0027 Again Goodly\u0027s eyebrow.\u0027You said it was night-time when Xanadu went up in flames, and - \u0027\u0027Not Xanadu,\u0027 Goodly stopped him. \u0027Just a handful of weekend or holiday homes, on the false plateau where Xanadu stands now.\u0027\u0027Whatever,\u0027 Trask waved a hand. \u0027But you did say there was a full moon?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\u0027Well, that ... is one hell of a clue!\u0027 He turned to Harvey where he sat at the computer keyboard. \u0027Jimmy, can you get into the local libraries on that thing?\u0027Harvey looked up from where he was working and smiled. But before he could say anything Trask said, \u0027I know, don\u0027t say it: you\u0027re way ahead of me. The newspapers? For the fires of\u002797?\u0027Harvey nodded towards the wall screen. \u0027On the screen, just about any time ... now!\u0027And: Gadgets and ghosts! thought Jake, as headlines sprang into life on the big screen, and Harvey brought the small print into focus. The location, date, and time, everything was there, written into the report. And Trask said:\u0027Good! Now then, Jimmy, can you cross-reference that date with phases of the moon?\u0027It took but a moment, but then Trask\u0027s shoulders sagged as he slumped into a seat and said, \u0027Damn it all to hell! The last thing I wanted. A bloody full moon!\u0027 And looking at the precog: \u0027So maybe you can see the past, and not just remember it, after all...\u0027\u0027And maybe he can\u0027t/ said Jake. It was the first time he had spoken, and now everyone looked at him. And after a while:\u0027Well, go on then,\u0027 said Trask.\u0027Shouldn\u0027t we take the next step?\u0027 Jake said. \u0027The same as we did with David Chung? I seem to have been hearing about synchronicity, coincidence, and what have you ever since I collided with this outfit. So couldn\u0027t this be exactly the same thing? I mean, just because there was a full moon on the night in question back in \u002797, that doesn\u0027t mean the precog wasn\u0027t seeing the future up there at Xanadu. Or aren\u0027t there going to be any more full moons? Me, I\u0027m wondering when the next one is due.\u0027\n Trask frowned, stared at Jake, then turned again to Jimmy Harvey. \u0027Do it,\u0027 he said.\n And in a very short time the answer was up on the screen.\u0027Three days\u0027 time!\u0027 Trask husked then, open-mouthed, staring at the date and full-moon symbol. And Goodly cautioned:\u0027But does it mean what we\u0027re thinking? Are we going to do it, or is it our old friend El Nino again? Will it result from us attacking the place and burning out a nest, or from a freak of nature, a terrible disaster? I still can\u0027t see how it\u0027s possible for our quarry to exist up there.\u0027And Jake said, \u0027Neither could the locator see how a vampire could live out on the ocean. And maybe I\u0027m stupid, or a lot less bright than you people, but I can\u0027t see there being a fire up at Xanadu without we\u0027re the cause. Surely the first thing we do if Xanadu isn\u0027t what we\u0027re looking for, we\u0027ll warn whoever\u0027s responsible about the fire. And we\u0027ll be able to tell him when, so there\u0027ll be no loss of life.\u0027The precog shook his head. \u0027You\u0027re not at all stupid, Jake. In the dark it\u0027s always the blind who see best. But believe me, you don\u0027t understand the future. I don\u0027t understand the future! And I say again: it\u0027s not knowing what will happen that counts, but how it\u0027s going to happen. The only sure thing is once it\u0027s foreseen, then it will happen. As for loss of life: I did hear that voice calling, \"To me! To me!\"\u0027\u0027Rescuers?\u0027 said Liz.\u0027Or one of us, pulling the teams out,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027Didn\u0027t you recognize the voice?\u0027Goodly shook his head. \u0027Not over the roaring of the flames, the shattering of glass.\u0027\u0027Glass?\u0027 said Jake. \u0027Did I miss something, or is that something you didn\u0027t mention before?\u0027\u0027I just this minute remembered it!\u0027 said the precog.\u0027There was plenty of glass in that topmost dome,\u0027 Jake said \u0027In the pleasure dome itself. Black glass, from the look of it, covering everything but the windows.\u0027\n \u0027No/ said the precog. \u0027Not black glass but solar panels - a sort of glass, I suppose. The upper dome was covered in them: a very startling effect. But the windows themselves, they were glass, certainly, and they circled all three lower floors.\u0027Trask was looking at the colour brochure. \u0027You think that the casino\u0027s going to burn?\u0027But Goodly could only shrug his defeat. \u0027It\u0027s all speculation. Don\u0027t ask me what I think. I still don\u0027t know for sure if the fire was in the past or the future. And I\u0027m damned if I can see how any kind of vampire could live up there!\u0027\u0027But I can,\u0027 said Jake, watching Harvey searching for Xanadu, and finally putting that area of the Macpherson Range onto the screen. And, as before, Jake was suddenly the centre of attention. \u0027It was something Lardis said that got me thinking about it,\u0027 he explained.\u0027Me?\u0027 said Lardis, looking surprised.\u0027When you said, \"Now wouldn\u0027t this make a wonderful aerie, without all this sunlight, of course.\"\u0027\u0027That\u0027s right/ said Lardis. \u0027I said that.\u0027\u0027Look at the map,\u0027 Jake told them. \u0027That dog-leg fold and the false plateau sitting in the middle. The mountains are much higher, and steep-sided. The fold goes north to south, and then backtracks. Certainly Xanadu gets plenty of sunlight, from, say 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 in the evening. But the rest of the time it\u0027s in the shade, and during the night the darkness must be utter - except for electric lighting, of course.\u0027\u0027Artificial lighting can\u0027t harm them/ said Trask. \u0027Szwart doesn\u0027t like it but it can\u0027t kill him. Only natural light, sunlight itself, can do that.\u0027\u0027Not quite true/ Lardis barked. \u0027The Dweller, Harry Hell-lander\u0027s changeling son, used artif - er, artificial light, yes - in the form of ultra, er, ultraviolet lamps, when he battled the Wamphyri in his garden in the mountains west of Starside.\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s sunlight, Lardis/ Trask told him. \u0027Artifical, I\u0027ll grant you, but sunlight nevertheless.\u0027 And to Jake: \u0027Maybe you\u0027re right. For sixteen or more hours a day, the sun isn\u0027t in fact shining directly onto that place. When it is shining, however, it\u0027s doing it very brightly/\n And Jake answered, \u0027But don\u0027t they sleep during the day?\u0027\n And again Lardis: \u0027In Starside, when the sun\u0027s rim came up over the barrier mountains, the Lords and Ladies usually ran to their northermost apartments. And there they slept - but even there with drapes at their windows! But if they were caught out in the open Sunside of the mountains, as occasionally happened, then they had to find caves or deep holes in the earth \u0027til nightfall/\n Jake nodded, and said to Trask, \u0027So, do you think there are no \"deep holes in the earth\" in Xanadu? But that brochure says it all. Fancy fountains, swimming pools, saunas and gymnasiums. An aerial monorail, and a casino. I mean, do you think that all of that stuff is above ground? No, a complex like that is like an iceberg: you only see its tip. All the cellars and conduits; the pipelines, tunnels, sewerage, and water systems; the reservoirs, pump-, boiler- and storage-rooms, and refrigerators - they\u0027re all underground - or rather, they\u0027re on the old bed of the plateau, while the resort has been built above them. That\u0027s why the place looks so clean and uncluttered .. /\n Trask blinked, shook his head as if to clear it, and said, \u0027Do you know, I believe you could be right? This creature we\u0027re looking for could be right there, in or under Xanadu!\u0027 He tossed the brochure onto the table. \u0027A place like that, where we would least expect to find him!\u0027 Then once more he said, \u0027Three days, and we have a lot to do ... not least to prove our point, clear the way before we can take any real action/\n \u0027Prove our point?\u0027 Liz looked at him.\u0027Make sure we\u0027re on the right track/ Trask nodded. \u0027So we can be certain when we go in that what we want is there. And as for clearing the way: well, the Gibson Desert job was one thing but Xanadu is quite another. All of those people; we\u0027ll have to find a way to get them out of there before we go in - and without arousing anyone\u0027s suspicion.. / Then, offering another curt nod:\n \u0027Right, so let\u0027s get to it. This night is still young, but there may be only three of them left.\u0027Heading for a door leading to an outer room, where the SAS Commanders were poring over their maps, Trask\u0027s heart was a little lighter; for now at least he had something to tell them. But before leaving, he turned and said, lan, David, Liz - and you, too, Jake - I\u0027m very grateful. You\u0027ve all worked well, despite initial doubts. But today was only your first time out and you\u0027re not finished yet. I want you all back in those Skytours choppers again tomorrow. So, maybe we have struck it lucky this first time, but who knows what else could be hiding out there?\u0027 Then he looked at his technicians: the gnomish Harvey, and the gangling Paul Arenson.\u0027But there are more skills than this freaky stuff that we espers use - or that uses us, whichever,\u0027 he said. \u0027Our ghost-talents may serve us well, but without your gadgets for back-up they wouldn\u0027t be nearly as effective. So well done, all of you. And now get your thinking caps on and try to look ahead. Jimmy: dig up some plans of Xanadu, its subsurface systems, et cetera, lan: please draft a comprehensive record of this meeting. Paul: it\u0027s late now, but first thing tomorrow ensure I have access to Prime Minister Blackmore\u0027s office so that I can organize a liaison with someone on this marine park thing.\u0027Turning away, he offered one of his rare smiles and said: \u0027And that, I think, is that. Now I have to speak to our Australian friends. I\u0027ll see you all in the morning ...\u0027The next day, a Saturday, they split the teams up. Lardis, Jake and Liz were together on the northern routes (Trask didn\u0027t want Liz anywhere near Xanadu); Goodly and Chung flew south, each of them hoping to complement the other\u0027s strange talent.\n The trips were mainly uneventful; the precog\u0027s mind was a frustrating blank - at least where the future was concerned - and the locator daren\u0027t get too close to Xanadu in case someone, or something, should locate him! But in any case and as per Trask\u0027s orders, they were looking at different mountains this time out. As for Trask himself:\n He had a very satisfying day, and when the teams returned to the safe house he was waiting to speak to them. This time he brought the SAS in on it - at least for the first stage of his briefing. For while it wasn\u0027t his intention to explain his findings in their entirety (the way E-Branch had used its combined paranormal talents to discover their targets) still he did have to display those targets, and advise these men as best possible on what they would be up against.\n This was done with the aid of the wall screen; Trask supplied the narrative:\u0027This island in the Capricorn Group - its grid reference is shown alongside - is our secondary target. Now, I\u0027ve called it an island, but in fact it\u0027s little more than a rock or coral reef. It has a few trees, some other tough vegetation; nothing much to mention. It was a marine park conservation station some years ago but that moved to Heron Island, forty miles away. All that\u0027s there now is the reef, a shallow lagoon, a private villa on the island, and, we presume, our enemies. But I have to emphasize that they are probably lesser enemies, which is to say we don\u0027t think they\u0027re of the order of unpleasantness that we were obliged to deal with in the Gibson Desert. However, and having said that, you should remember that they will be vampires.\u0027How many of them? No more than five or six, which is six too many. But with a chopper, a hired vessel, and half a dozen or so of your men - along with Jake Cutter here and Lardis Lidesci from our side - that should be sufficient. You, which is to say the military, will have command; but you\u0027ll listen very carefully to Lardis, and you\u0027ll take his advice in the ... the handling of whatever you find on that island. Take my word for it, Lardis is the foremost authority in these matters.Very well, what can you expect to find in the villa? The master of the house for one, a man of some fifty-eight years of age. Easy? But he\u0027ll be a vampire, and as strong as any four or five of your men! Then there\u0027ll be his married daughter and her husband, also his son and possibly a woman friend. The worst of them will be a fourth man, not family, who we think will be acting in the role of their keeper. And he will be dangerous, much more so than the others.\u0027Now, the problem is this: some if not all of these people will look and act perfectly normal. A bit edgy, perhaps. But if you were to strand your boat on the beach there, they\u0027d probably help out; they might even call the coastguard for assistance. That\u0027s because they want to appear normal, because they daren\u0027t be discovered for what they really are - not until their master decides they\u0027re no longer of any use to him, or her. So, assuming it\u0027s a \"him\" for the time being, what use are they to him?\u0027Well, for one, the island is a bolthole: it\u0027s a place for the Vampire Lord to hide in the event he gets driven out of his aerie. So in fact it\u0027s much similar to the Old Mine Gas Station in the desert. You must plan to take it out accordingly and, if necessary, in exactly the same way. With an air strike, yes, if it comes down to that - though of course we\u0027d vastly prefer the kind of hit at which you people so excel: seek and destroy, and as quickly and quietly as possible.\u0027And that\u0027s about it, all you need to know about this secondary target for the time being. But I would like to take this opportunity to remind you: you won\u0027t be taking any prisoners ...\u0027Which leads me to your main target. Xanadu, the so-called \"health and pleasure resort\" high in the Macphersons. And so it is a resort, but only as a front for the ugly Thing that\u0027s runing the show.\n \u0027And here\u0027s another problem: this time we don\u0027t know - we have no idea - how many men he\u0027s vampirized. The only thing we can say for sure is that when they know they\u0027re being hit, then they\u0027ll protect their master with all that\u0027s left of their miserable lives.\n \u0027Oh yes, and one other thing. When the Wamphyri came into our world, they brought thralls or \"lieutenants\" with them. Now, an original lieutenant out of Starside is a very dangerous creature, much more so than our old friend Bruce Trennier, and you know what he was like. So I\u0027m just reminding you, it\u0027s possible that one of these things is up there, too.\u0027\n The map on the big wall screen had changed. Trask pointed to it again, said, \u0027Here\u0027s Xanadu; you know where it is, for of course you\u0027ve all flown over it and seen it for yourselves. And anyway the bloody place is signposted! A resort, as we\u0027ve seen. The perfect cover, yes. Which also makes it difficult for us to deal with the creature or creatures that we\u0027ll find there. Why? Because this time the master vampire is hiding in a crowd!\u0027That\u0027s my next job: finding a way to get the people - I mean the ordinary people - out of there before Monday night.\u0027And so, gentlemen, that\u0027s it for now. Now you can go work out your harbour areas, decide where you\u0027ll locate your men and vehicles as they start to come in. The one good thing about it: they won\u0027t have much spare time on their hands, won\u0027t lose their edge or get bored. They\u0027ll no sooner be in situ than they\u0027ll be in a firefight. And I think I can promise you that where Xanadu is concerned, that last is guaranteed. Take it as a foregone - or at least a foreseen - conclusion.\u0027The SAS Commanders left the ops room, and Trask was alone with his own people.\u0027So, as you can see,\u0027 he said, \u0027the techs and I have had a busy day. But fruitful? Judge for yourselves.\u0027He gave Jimmy Harvey the nod, and the big wall screen displayed the group of islets again. And Trask continued:\u0027This island in the Capricorn Group - it\u0027s such a rock it doesn\u0027t even have a name - is the home of wealthy philanthropist Jethro Manchester. Like many another rich do-gooder before him, he\u0027s something of a recluse. Five years ago, in return for his patronage and a whole lot of money, the Barrier Reefs Marine\n Park Commission gave him the island to live on. He owns it, or as good as. But that\u0027s not all he owns .. .\u0027Trask paused and glanced at Harvey, whose fingers tapped at his keyboard. And now the big wall screen was divided centrally between the islands and a map of the dog-leg fold in the Macpherson Range. Trask glanced at the screen, and nodded his curt nod. \u0027Hands up who knows what I\u0027m talking about.\u0027And Liz said, \u0027He owns Xanadu, too?\u0027Trask looked at her. \u0027Used to,\u0027 he said. \u0027But now he has a partner. Nine months ago Manchester signed documents that transferred fifty per cent of Xanadu to one Aristotle Milan, an alleged \"shipping magnate\" of mixed Greek and Italian descent. We might perhaps assume - or rather, I believe we\u0027re supposed to assume - that his surname derives from the city of his origins in the old Italian fashion. But I don\u0027t think so. The coincidence is just too great, not to mention the rest of the story.\u0027First: there is no record of any Aristotle Milan as being the owner of any ships! Ergo: the man isn\u0027t a tycoon - though I can easily understand how the idea of being one would appeal to such as him - and as for his name ...\u0027\u0027... Not Milan but Malin,\u0027 Jake came in. \u0027Instead of using \"ari\" as a suffix, to denote \"son of,\" he\u0027s using it as a prefix, denoting \"first of. Meaning that on this world, he\u0027s the first or highest of his kind. And so for Aristotle Milan, read Malin-ari. Malinari the Mind!\u0027\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027What\u0027s in a name, eh? So, how did Malinari make his connection with Jethro Manchester? Ah, well, here\u0027s another name for you: Martin Trennier. Bruce Trennier\u0027s brother, a marine biologist employed by the Marine Park Commission until Manchester - our philanthropist, conservationist, recluse, and latter-day Jacques Cousteau - stole him away from them to be his very well-paid odd-jobs man, skin-diving companion, and general dogsbody. This happened about the same time that Manchester and his family got away from it all and retired to the island. Bruce Trennier would have known all of this when Malinari vampirized him at the Romanian Refuge, the said knowledge going second-hand to The Mind himself. Which begs the same question we\u0027ve all worried about before: what else did Malinari learn on that... on that terrible night?\u0027\n Trask\u0027s face was grey now, and all of his people knew why: that his concern wasn\u0027t just for Zek - who was gone now - but also for them. For Zek Foener had known as much as anyone about E-Branch and its workings.And Malinari?lan Goodly determined to change the subject, take Trask\u0027s mind away from it. \u0027What if we\u0027re wrong and it\u0027s all coincidental, circumstantial? This pseudonymous-names business, our various hunches and observations, and everything else we\u0027ve come up with?\u0027\u0027A hell of a lot of coincidences, I\u0027d say!\u0027 Trask frowned at him.\u0027But what if)\u0027Trask shuffled notes he\u0027d made earlier, and said, \u0027Well, there is one more thing. In Xanadu, the pleasure dome or casino has a smaller, uppermost dome like a blister on top of the main structure. It sits on a spindle and revolves like certain fancy restaurants on their high towers. But in the nine months since Mr Milan moved in half of its windows have been painted black, both inside and out. Oh, and incidentally, the dome\u0027s rotation was originally designed to track the sun, letting in the light that the higher solar-panelled surfaces necessarily exclude. So it would appear that our Mr Milan has an aversion to strong sunlight...\u0027 Pausing, Trask looked at Goodly.The precog was quiet now, saying nothing, but his alleged \u0027concerns\u0027 hadn\u0027t fooled Trask one bit. For in its way Goodly\u0027s subterfuge had been a lie, a diversion to take Trask\u0027s mind off his lost Zek and get it back on track, and of course Trask knew it. A lie, yes, but a white one. And:\u0027So thanks, anyway,\u0027 he finally continued, looking directly into the precog\u0027s eyes, \u0027but I think we can safely conclude that here ...\u0027 he pointed a steady, resolute finger at the locations displayed on the wall screen, \u0027... that here be vampires!\u0027When no one had anything further to say, Trask finished up with: \u0027Very well, and now we have plans to make ...\u0027Later that evening, Jake was sitting on a bench in the cool of the garden, lost in his own strange, meditative thoughts, when Lardis found him and sat down beside him. After he had sniffed at the air for a while, the old man said, \u0027Carypsu?\u0027Oddly enough, Jake understood. \u0027Eucalyptus?\u0027 he answered. \u0027It\u0027s a tree, growing outside the wall.\u0027\u0027Yes,\u0027 Lardis nodded. \u0027Carypsu. We have them on Sunside.\u0027 And, after a moment or two\u0027s thought: \u0027May I ask a question?\u0027\u0027What\u0027s on your mind?\u0027 said Jake.At which Lardis smiled. \u0027But I might ask you the selfsame thing! What\u0027s on, or what\u0027s in, your mind?\u0027Jake frowned. \u0027Some kind of word game?\u0027\u0027No,\u0027 Lardis shook his head. \u0027No word game. But I have to admit, I\u0027m curious.\u0027\u0027About what?\u0027\u0027About you. About how you knew that in Starside in the old days a Lord of the Wamphyri might occasionally add \"ari\" to his father\u0027s name, denoting that he was his father\u0027s son.\u0027\u0027You mean like Lord Malin was Malinari\u0027s father?\u0027\u0027Indeed. And now that you mention it ... how you knew that, too?\u0027Jake frowned again, deeper this time. But then he relaxed, and shrugged. \u0027You must have told me,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or maybe I\u0027ve read of it somewhere. In Ben Trask\u0027s files, perhaps?\u0027 But:\u0027No,\u0027 Lardis shook his head, smiling in that knowing way of his. \u0027No, I haven\u0027t told you. I\u0027ve had no reason to mention it to anyone. And as far as I know it isn\u0027t written anywhere.\u0027\n Then, creaking to his feet, the old man yawned and said, \u0027Well, goodnight, Jake. And pleasant dreams ...\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-29.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
