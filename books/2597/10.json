Future shock, or something. Anyway, it\u0027s not that side of the equation that concerns us, not this time/\\n\\n \u0027Then if it\u0027s no the gadgets, it must be the ghosts/ said the other, still staring at Jake.And Trask nodded. \u0027One ghost, anyway/ he said...\\n\\n The Why Of It\\n\\n CHAPTER NINE\\n\\n Regression\\n\\n As they seated themselves at a folding table, to a breakfast of black coffee in plastic mugs and bacon and eggs on paper plates, Trask made belated introductions. \u0027Jake Cutter, mah guid friend here is Grahame McGilchrist, Laird o\u0027 Kinlochry ...\u0027 But then he ahemmed his embarrassment, and went on, \u0027Who, despite my atrociously false and corny accent, is the genuine article.\u0027Shaking hands with the big Scotsman across the table, Jake said, \u0027A Scottish laird, living on the other side of the world? There has to be something of a story in that.\u0027\u0027No much o\u0027 a one,\u0027 the other rumbled. \u0027It\u0027s simply a matter o\u0027 choice. See, the McGilchrist estate went broke all o\u0027 a hundred years ago. Oh, Ah had mah crumblin\u0027 old castle, but in truth Ah wiz a figurehead in the local community, and that wiz a\u0027. But Ah still had mah pride. So, when a cousin o\u0027 mine pegged it out here in Oz and left me his wee place in Carnarvon, Ah came out and took over. That was some nine years ago.\u0027\u0027That \"wee place\" Grahame\u0027s talking about,\u0027 Trask cut in, \u0027is two and a half thousand acres of well-watered farmland east of Carnarvon. If he wanted to sell up he could go back home and be a proper laird again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Ah willnae do it,\u0027 McGilchrist said. \u0027Ah have lads tae tend mah land and animals, while Ah have mah own interests.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He has a practice in Carnarvon/ Trask explained. \u0027His own special slant on psychiatry.\u0027\u0027Aye, and there ye have the other reason why Ah made mahsel scarce frae they so-called \"British\" Isles.\u0027 McGilchrist cocked his head, frowned at Trask and winked at Jake. \u0027Tae escape frae these bleddy E-Branch types!\u0027\u0027He worked for us a while/ Trask said. But Jake had been quick to catch on to something else. \u0027Psychiatry?\u0027 he said, suspiciously. \u0027And I\u0027m the subject?\u0027Liz Merrick appeared out of nowhere, looking great in black slacks, cowboy boots and a frilly white blouse. Seating herself beside Jake, she said, \u0027And a suitable subject at that/\u0027\u0027Thanks/ Jake told her sourly, while he waited for Trask\u0027s or McGilchrist\u0027s explanation. And:\u0027Hypnotic regression/ Trask said without further preamble. \u0027That\u0027s Grahame\u0027s speciality. It\u0027s not a \"talent\" as recognized by E-Branch - that is, it isn\u0027t some strange parapsychological ability, though the way it works for Grahame it might well be - but it does come in useful in cases like yours/ \u0027Cases like mine?\u0027 Again Jake waited.\u0027Where the subject has subconsciously deleted some part of his memory/ Trask said. \u0027Or something else has blocked it - \u0027\u0027 - Or he has simply forgotten it/ McGilchrist finished it for him. \u0027Ye\u0027re no a nutcase, if that\u0027s what\u0027s bothering ye.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t know him yet/ said Liz, and Jake scowled. McGilchrist grinned at Liz across the table and said, \u0027Will one o\u0027 ye kind gentleman no introduce me tae this beautiful wee thing? Oh, Ah ken Ah\u0027m a mite late - a mite too old, maybe? - but still Ah\u0027d like tae be in wi\u0027 a chance!\u0027\u0027Too late?\u0027 Liz blushed at his words. But McGilchrist simply looked at Jake, smiled, and went on eating ...\\n\\n Jake had been studying the Scotsman, and despite his apprehension he discovered that he liked him. McGilchrist seemed as open as a book. The hypnotist was tall, yes, but with his huge chest and massive girth looked almost stocky. Jake could well picture him tossing a caber, and for that matter he could probably toss big men around as well. Except, Jake reckoned, that wouldn\u0027t be in his nature. He was the salt of Scottish soil, the hard flint of wooded mountains, however far removed; but there was a kindness - an understanding of Nature, human nature especially - in those dark eyes of his, however deeply they might probe.\\n\\n It was frequently the same with men of rare ability. Even in Jake\u0027s few days with E-Branch he had been aware of it in Ben Trask\u0027s espers, the ones he\u0027d met, and of course in the Head of E-Branch himself. The big Scotsman might not be as parapsychologically endowed as a true esper, but still there was that special something about him; in those eyes, mainly - those hypnotic eyes - and the way they studied a man ...Jake suddenly realized that they\u0027d been studying him, reading him much as he had been reading the other. Perhaps reading him more, or more cleverly. And breakfast was over now.\u0027So when\u0027s it tae be?\u0027 McGilchrist stood up, stretched and yawned. \u0027God, but ye got me up early, Ben Trask! Ah wiz barely in bed ... then up again, when yere chopper landed in mah back yard. Ah wiz expectin\u0027 yere man, aye, but no at that hour.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m sorry about that/ Trask said, \u0027but we never know how long we\u0027ll be in any one place. And in fact we could be moving on at any time. I\u0027m just waiting on some information from London, and then we\u0027ll be out of here/He got to his feet, Jake and Liz, too, and she said, \u0027Can I come in on this? Jake\u0027s my partner, after all/\u0027He might yet be your partner/ Trask answered immediately. \u0027We won\u0027t know that until we know.\u0027And Jake, as fidgety as ever, burst out, \u0027Then for Christ\u0027s sake let\u0027s get on with it! For whatever it is, it seems my future\u0027s hanging on it.\u0027\u0027Yere future?\u0027 said Grahame McGilchrist, as Trask led them towards his tent. \u0027Ah, no. Ye\u0027d be better off askin\u0027 the precog about that. And ye\u0027ll find that even he isnae that sure. But as for the past: well, that\u0027s different. What\u0027s been has been, and it cannae be changed. But even if it\u0027s been well and truly buried - buried in or by the mind, that is - we can usually dig it up again, aye. And as for me: Ah\u0027m one hell o\u0027 an archaeologist/\u0027 He turned his attention to Trask.\u0027So then, but this is a verra different E-Branch to the one Ah used tae know. They pilots, talkin\u0027 over there: Australians, aye? And a couple more fiddlin\u0027 wi\u0027 those vehicles there? Seems ye\u0027re recruitin\u0027 far afield these days, Benjamin.\u0027\u0027No, not really/ Trask answered. \u0027Not even if it was just our espers you were talking about. See, in E-Branch we\u0027ve never much cared about colours, creeds or nationalities. In that respect you could even say that we\u0027ve always recruited far afield. For example: David Chung is of Chinese stock, you are Scottish, and poor Darcy Clarke\u0027s forebears were French. As for Zek Foener. Zek ...\u0027 Trask\u0027s voice faltered and his face clouded over.\u0027Aye, Ah ken, and Ah\u0027m sorry/ McGilchrist took his arm. They had arrived at Trask\u0027s tent. Freeing himself from the Scotsman\u0027s grip, his well-meant but inopportune commiseration, Trask turned his face away, occupied himself in fastening back the entrance flap to let in the predawn light. And in a while:\u0027Currently the team consists of a small nucleus of agents, mainly from London HQ/ he went on on. \u0027But the back-up squads are Australian military, and likewise all their gear. It\u0027s not likely that anyone would know that, because the tac signs have been removed from the vehicles and choppers, and of course the men themselves aren\u0027t wearing their standard uniforms. But the discipline is the same. And you\u0027re quite right, Grahame, there have been several changes in E-Branch. For one, we\u0027re no longer the shoestring outfit that we used to be. Financially we\u0027re pretty stable now; when you can pay your own way, it gives you that much more clout.\\n\\n \u0027Five years ago, through our dealings with Gustav Turchin, the Russian Premier, we got ourselves accepted and well-established. We could afford to come out of hiding - emerge, as it were, from the esoteric closet - but never too far. For let\u0027s face it, an organization like E-Branch can\u0027t remain secret if everyone knows about it.\\n\\n \u0027As for these Australians: obviously they\u0027re all subject to their own version of the Official Secrets Act, and they\u0027ve all been hand-picked for their loyalty, their unswerving devotion to duty and their country. Isn\u0027t that just exactly how it should be? Who better to do ... well, what I\u0027m calling on them to do, than loyal subjects of the country under threat?\u0027\u0027Under threat?\u0027 Suddenly McGilchrist\u0027s tone was sharp as he took his seat at Trask\u0027s small table.Trask nodded gravely. \u0027Perhaps the entire world/ he said. \u0027Except the world doesn\u0027t know it yet, and it mustn\u0027t/\u0027A secret invasion?\u0027 McGilchrist looked from face to face, trying to fathom their expressions. \u0027As bad as a\u0027 that, is it? Then ye can only be talkin\u0027 about one thing. Oh, Ah dinnae need tae ken it a\u0027, but is it... Them?\u0027 An ex-member of the Branch, he\u0027d had access to the files on their long-term war against the Wamphyri; indeed those files had long been required reading for all Branch operatives and senior affiliates.\u0027Grahame, you weren\u0027t part of the Sunside/Starside thing/ Trask told him, \u0027and from past experience I know how dangerous it could be to put you in the picture now. So please let it be. But yes, it is ... Them. And now perhaps you\u0027ll forgive me for getting you out of bed in the middle of the night? As for Jake Cutter here, he could be very important to us - but very important - in the work we\u0027ve still to do/The big Scot had heard enough and was suitably impressed. \u0027Then we\u0027d best be at it/ he said. \u0027But tell me, just what am Ah supposed tae be lookin\u0027 for? Can ye no offer a wee clue?\u0027Trask looked torn two ways. He glanced first at Jake, then turned back to McGilchrist. \u0027I can, but that would mean telling Jake, too/\u0027What\u0027s that? But doesnae he have a right to know?\u0027 McGilchrist frowned. And Jake said:\\n\\n \u0027Huh! My point exactly.\u0027\u0027But/ Trask countered, \u0027if he does have such a right, why doesn\u0027t he already know? If he\u0027s been denied access, it must be for a reason. In which case, what right have I to give him access now?\u0027McGilchrist shook his head, frowned again. \u0027Well, doubtless ye ken well enough what ye\u0027re on about, but Ah\u0027m as much in the dark as Jake here! Can ye no gi\u0027 me a startin\u0027 point?\u0027\u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027That I can do. Just a week ago Jake was in jail in Italy, Turin, when - \u0027 \u0027Undercover?\u0027 the hypnotist cut in.\u0027Er, no/ said Trask, and the big Scot sat back and scratched at his beard musingly. \u0027Anyway/ Trask went on, \u0027Jake escaped from the prison, barely. But it\u0027s the way he escaped that interests us. And it\u0027s where he escaped to .. /\u0027Eh?\u0027 said McGilchrist. \u0027Escaped to ... ?\u0027 \u0027To Harry\u0027s Room, Grahame/ Trask told him. \u0027You\u0027ll remember Harry\u0027s Room, at E-Branch HQ?\u0027\u0027Ah!\u0027 The other stopped scratching on the instant, stared hard at Trask, and harder still at Jake. \u0027He escaped there, ye say?\u0027\u0027Arrived there/ said Trask. \u0027But the question is, was he brought there, or did he come of his own volition ... or was he sent? And if the latter, by whom was he sent?\u0027 And again:\u0027AW.\u0027 said McGilchrist. \u0027Verra well, then that\u0027ll be our startin\u0027 point: the prison, the escape/ He unbuttoned a tartan shirt pocket, took out a small vial and uncorked it, gave it to Jake and said, \u0027Sit down here and swally that/Jake sat, looked at the colourless liquid in the vial suspiciously. \u0027Do what?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s only a wee drug/ McGilchrist was completely matter-of-fact about it. \u0027We\u0027ve had truth drugs a long time now, stuff ye had tae inject. But we\u0027ve come a ways since then. This isnae a truth drug, but it does open the mind ... it lets ye see more clearly intae yere own past. Aye, and it lets ye talk about it! Oh, and one other thing: it enhances mah power over ye/\\n\\n \u0027Your power over me?\u0027 Jake didn\u0027t like the sound of that, especially since he\u0027d already poured the draught down his gullet.\\n\\n \u0027It simply means that unless there\u0027s a verra strong post-hypnotic block on yere mind, yell gi\u0027 me all the assistance Ah require. Ye willnae hold anythin\u0027 back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if there is a post-hypnotic block? Will that mean I\u0027ve been hypnotized before?\u0027\u0027Well, if no hypnotized, ye\u0027ll have been got at, certainly/\u0027And you\u0027ll be able to clear it?\u0027\u0027Man, Ah cannae make ye that kind o\u0027 promise/ McGilchrist was honest about it. \u0027As Ben here will tell ye, there\u0027s hypnotists ... and then there\u0027s hypnotists. And if what he fears has been here first.. / He shrugged.\u0027I understand/ said Jake, though in fact he didn\u0027t.\u0027Now, that\u0027s a fast-actin\u0027 drug that\u0027s in ye/ McGilchrist continued, \u0027so Ah\u0027d best be tellin\u0027 ye one or two things. Ye\u0027re tae sit verra still and upright in yere chair; oh, dinnae fret, Ah wouldnae let ye topple over. And ye\u0027re tae look at me, at mah eyes. Verra big and black, mah eyes, are they no?\u0027They were very big and black, and Jake\u0027s head was beginning to spin oh so slowly, languidly at first, but gradually getting faster; as if he were drunk, flat on his back on a bed, and the room spinning around him but without the sick feeling.\u0027And here\u0027s me bringin\u0027 mah eyes closer, lookin\u0027 at ye, and lookin intae ye/ McGilchrist\u0027s voice was so very low now, like the growl of a great wolf. So low, so dark, and so close. \u0027Ah\u0027m lookin\u0027 intae ye, and ye\u0027re lookin\u0027 intae mah eyes, or is it mah eye? For see, there\u0027s only one o\u0027 they now! The two have merged intae one, like a wee swirly black hole in mah face. Or maybe a big black hole? And it\u0027s suckin\u0027 at ye, Jake, suckin\u0027 at ye .. /It was indeed. That blackest of black holes, spinning faster and faster. And Jake felt its lure, its attraction. God, if he could back out of this now he would! But he couldn\u0027t. And:\u0027Dinnae fight it, laddie/ said a voice that burned in his head. Just let it go, and come to me. Open up to Grahame/ And then:\\n\\n The black hole had him! He was sucked in and whirled like a bug down a plughole. It was as quick as thought; it had happened before he could even cry out, if he had been able to ...!Paolo has slid a length of rubber tubing over the links of the chain to deaden itsclanking. Now he looks at me, gives me the nod, and I cup my bands far him.He steps into my hands, and I can smell his groin ... he smells of fear, andI imagine I do, too. Thank Cod there\u0027s no moon!He\u0027s up on my shoulders now, swinging the chain. I hear it swish throughthe dark night air... hear it clatter, too, just the once but enough to make me grit my teeth. And now there\u0027s a scraping sound as Paolo hauls on the chain, fattening the roll of barbed wire to the top of the wall. But he\u0027s done it! Paolois on his way up the chain!I look up; his head and shoulders are silhouetted against the black horizon of the wall. He clings to the chain with his right hand, takes the blanket from around his neck and lobs it up and over. The wire is covered. Damn.\u0027 The man\u0027s a genius!Now he\u0027s balanced up there with one leg over the wall, and he\u0027s reaching down for me. My heart is thudding, hammering away in my chest, but at last I\u0027m on the chain. Up I go, and I reach for Paolo\u0027s hand. But what? What? He withdraws it!I don\u0027t believe it! (But I do, I do! I just knew it was too bloody easy!) And I cling to the chain and look up at him, look into his eyes that are looking down into mine. Except now they look beyond me, into the night.And dangling there, I glance over my shoulder and see them: prison guards, armed and taking aim across the exercise yard. I look up at Paolo, and his sweat falls on me like rain. He gives a shrug, says: \u0027I sorry, Jake, but they promise me ...\u0027 And then he jerks and I hear the shot. And now Paolo\u0027s blood splashes me as his right eye turns black.\\n\\n He\u0027s falling, taking me with him ... we hit the ground like a ton of bricks! Paolo\u0027s body is on top of me, which is just as well, because I can feel it jerking, shuddering to the sound of more gunshots. I struggle under his dead weight, somehow manage to throw him off and rise into a crouch. But God, I\u0027m a dead man - I have to be! Fat white sparks light the night like angry fireflies where bullets ricochet off the wall and spit concrete splinters at me. But now -\\n\\n - Now there\u0027s a spark that... that isn\u0027t a spark! 1 don\u0027t understand it, haven\u0027t the time to understand it. But it hovers there like a golden dart, level with my eyes, only twelve inches away, seeming to follow my movements as I dodge bullets. And now it moves, too. And I know that it has to be a bullft after all, because it smacks me right between the eyes!\\n\\n And I fall face first, but I can\u0027t feel it when I hit the ground. Of course I can\u0027t feel it, because you don\u0027t feel anything when you\u0027re dead.Dead and weightless and rushing somewhere, rushing out of my body, I suppose. Rushing to heaven or hell, if I believed. I wish I had believed now ... and I\u0027ll bet I\u0027m not the first man who thought that! But Jesus, I\u0027m not going out without a fight... not Jake Cutter! I struggle and twist and tumble. But this can\u0027t be right, because I can feel myself. I\u0027m not dead yet!And now I see a light in the darkness. I rush towards it, fall into it... No, I fall out of the darkness!My head! God, I\u0027m sick, dizzy, and my head ...!But I\u0027m not dead yet.I\u0027m not dead yet.Not dead yet.Not dead.Not.No. i\u0027It\u0027s been an hour/ said McGilchrist\u0027s voice. \u0027Ye ought tae be comin\u0027 out o\u0027 it now, Jake mah lad.\u0027Jake remembered where he was and would have jerked erect, but since he was already erect - sitting upright in his chair, just as the \u0027doctor\u0027 had ordered - instead he became aware of incredible cramps in all his limbs, whose pain was physical and of course far worse than the imagined thump on the head that he had \u0027experienced\u0027 for the second time around just a few moments ago.He opened his eyes, tried to reach up and touch his head, maybe cradle it in his trembling hands, but even the slightest movement caused violent shooting pains in his arms and shoulders, freezing him in position. And:\\n\\n \u0027G-God Almighty!\u0027 he groaned, his throat dry as kindling.McGilchrist dropped two white pills into a glass of water, swirled them and watched them dissolve. \u0027These\u0027ll do ye a power o\u0027 good/ he said.\u0027And I ... I should believe you?\u0027 said Jake, blinking rapidly as his eyes grew accustomed to the full dawn light.\u0027Eh? But they\u0027re only wee aspirins, man.\" McGilchrist told him. \u0027For yere headache, ye ken? Which is a side effect o\u0027 that draught o\u0027 mine. What, d\u0027ye really think Ah\u0027d poison ye?\u0027Slowly, Jake allowed himself to slump in his chair. And as his blood began to circulate and pins and needles took over from the true pain, so he took the glass and drank. And then he remembered not only what had gone before, but also something of his regression.Again he straightened up, but much more carefully now, and said, \u0027That dart. A golden dart or splinter. I seem to remember it... it entered my head?\u0027\u0027Just like you told me,\u0027 Liz Merrick sighed from where she sat close to him. \u0027Except you didn\u0027t call it a dart.\u0027Jake carefully turned to squint at her through the tent\u0027s luminous air. And Ben Trask said, \u0027I think that\u0027s all we needed to know. It makes any further questions I might have academic, conjectural, meaningless. For the time being, anyway.\u0027 He, too, was seated - looked like he needed to be - and his voice was trembling to match Jake\u0027s limbs.\u0027Great,\u0027 said Jake, unsteadily. \u0027Fine. So now that all of your questions are answered, how about mine?\u0027\u0027Yours?\u0027 said Trask, stopped dead in his tracks. And: \u0027Ah, well! We\u0027ll deal with those shortly, yes. And Jake, I\u0027m really, really very sorry about that - I mean, that I had to be so secretive. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand when you know it all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But for the next few minutes/ said McGilchrist, with his massive hand on Jake\u0027s shoulder, \u0027ye\u0027re tae take it easy, until ye\u0027re back on yere feet. And then ye should stop worryin\u0027 about what\u0027s happened tae ye. Ye\u0027re in the verra best o\u0027 hands, after a\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n The stiffness was draining from Jake\u0027s limbs and his headache was in recession. \u0027Did I do okay?\u0027 he said, looking at Ben Trask. \u0027Did you get all you wanted? It was that dart, right? It was that dart that I thought was a bullet. What in hell was the thing?\u0027\\n\\n But while Jake was beginning to feel okay, Trask was still shaken. \u0027It\u0027s not so much what it was,\u0027 he replied, \u0027as what it is, but definitely. And what that makes you.\u0027\u0027Makes me?\u0027 Sensing something of Trask\u0027s quandary, perhaps his reluctance to accept whatever he was having to accept, Jake had stopped feeling okay on the instant. Now, frowning, he said \u0027How do you mean, what it makes me? What I am is plain: a fugitive from so-called justice, hiding out under the protection of E-Branch. Unless you\u0027ve changed your mind, that is. Is that it? Did you learn something that makes you want to throw me back to the wolves? Am I in fact the sick, psychotic killer that people have been made to believe I am?\u0027And perhaps Trask would have started to tell him there and then, but at that moment lan Goodly\u0027s piping, excited voice was heard from across the clearing:\u0027Ben, Ben!\u0027 the precog was calling. \u0027Those serials. I know which ones are missing. And I think we\u0027re in a lot of trouble!\u0027\u0027Think?\u0027 Trask called from the open door of his tent.\u0027I know we are,\u0027 Goodly was closer now, and his voice commensur-ately less strident. \u0027I\u0027ve seen it coming, Ben,\u0027 he said, heading towards Trask\u0027s tent at a fast, agitated lope. \u0027Trouble with a capital \"T\", yes. So whatever it is you\u0027re doing, put it aside for now. This is just as important - maybe more so - and I think you need to hear me out\u0027As Trask ducked out under the tent\u0027s awning, Liz took hold of Jake\u0027s hand and said, \u0027No one thinks badly of you Jake. What you told us when you were under only serves to corroborate what Ben Trask has been hoping all along. But that\u0027s for him to tell you, not me. And as for throwing you to the wolves ... au contrain, Jake Cutter: on the contrary. But it could be his intention to throw you at them ...\u0027\\n\\n Ten minutes later, Trask had called his small nucleus of Branch people to him. And at the last moment he\u0027d invited Liz and Jake into the briefing. Everyone was crowded into his tent.Wasting no time, when all of his people had arrived, Trask said, \u0027I won\u0027t make a meal of this and as soon as we\u0027re through here I want you to start packing up. I\u0027d like to be out of here A.S.A.P. Ops truck and vehicles: strip them of everything important to us because we\u0027re leaving them behind. Our next target is too far away that we can simply drive to it. It was possible we might have stayed just as we are now, but something has come up. Our Aussie friends will have to follow on behind us, but as the brains behind the brawn, as it were, time is a luxury we\u0027ve just run out of. So ... what\u0027s the big hurry, eh?\u0027Well, you all know about our Mr Miller. But you don\u0027t know all about him. To recap: Miller\u0027s some kind of nut who believes in friendly aliens, and despite that he\u0027s seen the enemy pretty close up he thinks that we are the butchers! He thinks the work we did last night was a totally unjustified pre-emptive strike against a landing party of explorers from outer space, and that they only turned nasty in order to survive. He has even written books on the etiquette of first contact. So obviously, in Miller\u0027s warped perceptions, we\u0027re sadly lacking in manners.\u0027It doesn\u0027t matter that our \"aliens\" are stinking, murderous vampires from a parallel world; Miller\u0027s mania would never accept that. He doesn\u0027t believe a word I\u0027ve said to him - probably doesn\u0027t even believe they\u0027re vampires - but he does think he can talk to them ...\\n\\n \u0027Well, that in itself wouldn\u0027t be a problem. His own people can look after him, lock him up or do whatever they deem necessary to make him look like an idiot - which he is - if Miller should start babbling his \"crazy stories\" about our work to the press or other sensationalist outlets. So when I found out that he\u0027d made a run for it, in a way I was pleased. At least he was out of my hair. Yes, but that was before I discovered what he\u0027d taken with him.\\n\\n \u0027People, last night our locators at London HQ, headed up by David Chung, found us a new target: they detected a hitherto unsuspected patch of mindsmog on the other side of the Australian continent. It was only there for a moment - someone\u0027s mental shield slipped, shall we say? - but it was the real thing, the unmistakable signature of a Lord of the Wamphyri. I\u0027m talking about a Lord, yes. And what we have to remember is that the Thing we went up against last night, Bruce Trennier, that was a mere lieutenant - someone in thrall to a Lord - left behind by his maker and master for whatever reason.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, this mindsmog: it was detected at the same time - I mean precisely the same time - as we were dealing with Trennier. Now, we know that many of the Wamphyri had the power of telepathic contact with their thralls even over great distances, so it\u0027s possible, indeed probable, that Trennier\u0027s unknown master \"felt\" his lieutenant\u0027s death, and it so surprised or startled him that he let his guard down, if only for a moment. He might even have done it deliberately, tried to establish better contact with Trennier to find out what was happening. As for our people in London, they were lucky; someone happened to be looking in the right place at the right time, and that\u0027s when they detected the evil \"aura\" of a Great Vampire.\u0027Of course Chung forwarded this information to me, only to have it intercepted by Peter bloody Miller! And now I couldn\u0027t give a damn about him speaking to the media or anyone else for that matter. But I do care that he might be on his way to deliver a warning to one of the worst threats our world has ever faced ...\u0027... A warning that we are on our way to destroy it!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-10.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \\n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
