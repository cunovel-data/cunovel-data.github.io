Then someone (it sounded to Liz like \u0027Red\u0027 Bygraves) said, \u0027Holyfuck!\u0027 And everyone started talking at once. In Xanadu, Jethro Manchester had built a Pleasure Dome. Now it was gone, and Manchester with it, to an end as undeserved as it was brutal and horrific. Likewise the alien author of Xanadu\u0027s and Manchester\u0027s ruin; he, too, was gone. But Lord Nephran Malinari was fled, not dead. And it grieved Ben Trask\u0027s heart that he must admit it: that the chase wasn\u0027t nearly over yet, but if anything was now more needful and deadly than ever.For if the others, if Vavara and Szwart, were trying to do what Malinari had begun to do in subterranean Xanadu - if they, too, were nurturing \u0027gardens\u0027 of loathsome plague-bearing death-spawn - and if a single red spore, all unnoticed, inhaled like a speck of dust, could write finis on a human life and replace it with undeath, how then millions or billions of spores - and what then for the world ... ?On the second morning after the Australians cremated their four dead comrades in a quiet ceremony with full military honours - a ceremony which Trask and his E-Branch people felt privileged to attend, where in fact there were only three bodies in their coffins, for the fourth had burned on Manchester\u0027s island, and was represented by a photograph, a scroll of honour, and messages of farewell from his closest colleagues only - the second morning after that, the Major and his two stalwart Warrant Officers were at the airport in Brisbane to see Trask and his people off.After the British team had received their regulation new bubonic shots - for the Australian authorities were insistent that no one be allowed to enter or leave the continent without first being inoculated - then, over drinks in the departure lounge, Trask and the Major had a quiet word in private. Jake, Liz, and the rest of the team sat at a table with Bygraves and Davis, where for the better part they commiserated in silence. Something of an aftermath, it seemed there wasn\u0027t a lot to be said. But Trask and the SAS Major weren\u0027t willing to leave it at that.\u0027And so it goes on/ said the Major, Tor you at least.\u0027\u0027For us it never seems to end,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027Just when we think it might, there\u0027s always something new. Not always as bad as what we\u0027ve just been through, but always bad.\u0027\u0027And you can\u0027t give up on it,\u0027 said the Major; not a question but a statement of fact.\u0027Never!\u0027 Trask growled. \u0027This time, for me it\u0027s personal. But personal or not, it\u0027s always the same. We\u0027ve seen all this before, and we\u0027ll see it again. Yes, and we\u0027ll see it through, all the way to the end. But myself... I for one will never be able to rest until this one is dead. Or until I\u0027m dead. One or the other.\u0027\u0027Malinari?\u0027\u0027The same,\u0027 Trask nodded. \u0027I want that bastard dead, dead, dead! And I intend to get him, no matter what it takes. As Lardis Lideci might say, that\u0027s my vow. Hub! My Szgany vow, aye.\u0027\u0027Well, you have a good team to help you,\u0027 the Major glanced across the room at the people sitting with his men. \u0027Weird as hell, but good. That David Chung, for instance. Such a quiet little man - with his built-in radar dish. And the tall fellow, lan Goodly, who I\u0027d hate to play cards with. And Liz, who hears people thinking? I definitely wouldn\u0027t play cards with her! And as for Jake ... I just can\u0027t believe what he does! It may have saved my life, but I still don\u0027t believe it.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027And it doesn\u0027t help that it\u0027s something I can\u0027t talk about. Or something we can\u0027t talk about. But being what you are, SAS, I\u0027m sure you understand that. Anyway - and if it makes it any easier - there are times when I don\u0027t believe this stuff myself. Times when I wake up and think I\u0027ve been nightmaring. And the hell of it is, I\u0027m the only one who really knows that it\u0027s true!\u0027 The Major shook his head and said, \u0027Weird, weird people - but I\u0027m glad to have known you.\u0027\u0027Same here,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027I\u0027m only sorry that - \u0027\u0027I know.\u0027 The other cut him short. \u0027The only consolation lies in what we\u0027ve achieved. For let\u0027s face it, no sane people could ever suffer such as that to live. Those four lives might have saved thousands.\u0027But Trask shook his head. \"Think again,\u0027 he said. \u0027Thousands? There are over six billion people on this small planet. And that\u0027s how many we might have saved. Or that we\u0027ve started to save.\u0027And after a while the Major said, \u0027Hearing you put it like that, I know it was worth it.\u0027At which Liz called across and said, \u0027They\u0027re boarding.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s time we weren\u0027t here,\u0027 said Trask, standing up. And as the Major reached out his hand Trask looked at it, took it, and said, \u0027I don\u0027t even know your name!\u0027\u0027It\u0027s Tom,\u0027 said the other.\u0027Just Tom? Major Tom?\u0027\u0027That\u0027ll suffice,\u0027 said the Major, grinning.Trask smiled, too, and said, \u0027Well, Major Tom, ground control is calling for us.\u0027The Major had been carrying a fat, eighteen-inch-long parcel. Now he gave it to Trask. \u0027This is for you,\u0027 he said. \u0027The men found it when they went down and burned out the underground rooms, tunnels and conduits in Xanadu. It got burned, too, so I can guarantee it\u0027s clean. I don\u0027t believe in trophy-taking, not after a job like that one. Maybe you\u0027ll find a use for it.\u0027After that there was no time for anything other than handshakes all round. Then Trask and his people went to board their Qantas VTOL Skyskip ... But as they queued at the boarding gate, Jake sensed someone\u0027s gaze upon him and glanced toward the reinforced flexiglass wall that secured the boarding area from the viewing promenade. From the far side of the wall, distorted by the images of other passengers that moved across its reflective surface, a thin, pock-marked face looked back at him. And for a moment their eyes met before Jake looked away.He looked away, but only for a moment...... Until something went click in his memory and he gave a start and looked again. But the face was gone.Standing just behind him, Ben Trask had noticed his reaction and said, \u0027Is there something?\u0027Jake frowned, then shook his head. \u0027No/ he said. \u0027I don\u0027t think so. But just for a moment then I thought I might have ... recognized someone?\u0027Trask looked at him in a certain way, with his head cocked a little on one side, and said, \u0027Or you\u0027re concerned that maybe someone recognized you?\u0027Jake shrugged uncomfortably, said, \u0027That, too. But here in Australia? Unlikely.\u0027Very unlikely, yes. For as Jake had said, what would that lousy, murdering, bastard thug - what would the face of a man who had featured in his worst nightmares for far too long now, one of Luigi Castellano\u0027s soldiers, unforgotten from a certain monstrous night in Marseille - what would he be doing here? Then he shrugged again and put it out of his mind. It was part of his growing obsession, that was all, when from time to time he would see those faces wherever he looked; this despite that several of them were no more, dead by his hand. But still Jake looked again at the flexiglass partition before moving on into the boarding tunnel. And of course there was no one there ... As the VTOL Skyskip was rising vertically into the air, lifting its nose, and accelerating into the sky, the man with the pock-marked face was in a telephone kiosk, speaking long-distance to Palermo. \u0027No doubt about it/ he said in Italian. \u0027I\u0027d know the guy anywhere. He\u0027s alive and kicking, and there\u0027s been all kinds of shit going down around here, yeah! That Xanadu thing: they said it was a plague-spot, and an accidental fire burned it out down to the foundations. But I can tell you, Luigi, some of the crew who were up there clearing up afterwards - like, you know, military types? - they were here at the airport to see Cutter and these British people onto their plane. Like pals all round, you know? Me, I\u0027d like to know how you knew this Jake Cutter would be out here in the first place ...\u0027You didn\u0027t know? You were only interested in Xanadu ... ?\u0027And I ... I ask too many questions. Yeah, I know. You\u0027re right, sorry. So what now?\u0027I should find out who the Brits were? Get after them, on the next plane? Sure, I can handle that. And I can use the account in England, have myself some fun? Hey, I like it!\u0027Er, yeah ... ?\u0027But if I don\u0027t find out who they are, I needn\u0027t bother to go back to Marseille ... or anywhere. Right, Luigi, I got that. But say .. / And there he stopped short, scowling at the phone. For it was purring away vacantly to itself in his hand, and the oh-so-dark voice on the other end was gone ...On board the Skyskip, when they were indeed skipping across the outer atmosphere, Ben Trask started to open the parcel given to him by the Major. But as gleaming metal hooks appeared, flexible fish-scale plates and sharp-pointed gouges, he stopped, went pale, and wrapped the thing up again. Having seen its like before, on Starside in an alien world of vampires, he knew exactly what it was: a battle gauntlet, as used by the Wamphyri! But then, looking up and across the central aisle at David Chung, Trask\u0027s colour returned and he smiled a mirthless, vengeful smile. And: \u0027Lord Nephran Malinari/ he murmured to himself, under the subdued rumble of the Skyskip\u0027s engines, \u0027you can run but you can\u0027t hide.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-35.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
