{"id":97230,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"The Lull ... Sunday was a busy yet paradoxically quiet time; work was being done, but in a kind of vacuum chamber. People moved about with purpose within a oddly surreal atmosphere of near-silence. It was, Jake thought, a sensation similar to being on an airplane during its descent, in the moments before your ears pressurize, when sounds are flat and distant and you feel as though you\u0027ve suddenly gone deaf. In short, it was the lull before the storm, when the hatches are battened down, and Jake (who seemed to be the only one with no hatches to batten) felt completely out of it. Apart from an o-group he\u0027d been scheduled to attend in the evening, he had nothing to do. Which was as well, for he didn\u0027t think he would be able to concentrate on anything much; there was something on his mind, in the back of his head, desperately trying to push its way to the forefront. It had to do with last night - something lingering over from his dreams, perhaps? - but apart from that he was at a loss. Jake remembered his nightmare, of course. He always remembered that. It was a recurrent thing (a thing of conscience, he supposed), that came back to haunt him maybe two or three times a month. It had used to be far more frequent, but time is merciful and was doing its job. This thing in the back of his mind, however, was other than that; he found himself listening for an unknown something, and at the same time dreading it. So much so that he was shielding his mind to shut things out, and doing it consciously, holding at bay those whispering voices of which he was becoming ever more frequently aware... which might perhaps explain something of the eerie atmosphere: he was in fact isolating himself. And also from the living.It was a shuddersome thought, and deadspeak was a terrible thing. Jake found himself wondering if perhaps that was it: was it Harry he was listening for? Harry Keogh and the Great Majority? Was his neurosis growing, spreading out of control? Or was it something else, not fear at all but the simple need for privacy? Some kind of persecution complex, with Liz Merrick - his \u0027partner\u0027 - taking on the role of the Inquisition, or of a spy at the very least. But in any case, she was giving him the cold shoulder this morning. Odd, because he also felt that there was something she might want to tell him.Jake wandered about the safe house, through the Ops Room and other rooms, trying to interest himself in something - in anything - that was going on around him, and feeling more and more the outsider ... at least until Lardis Lidesci joined him and Jake saw that he was in the same boat.Jake really felt for Lardis, because he was a genuine outsider, not even of this world! On one occasion when they spoke to each other, the old man told him:\u0027Don\u0027t fret so! We\u0027re men of action, you and I. That\u0027s all it is. But we\u0027ll get to it, never fear.\u0027 Unlike Jake, however, the Old Lidesci made no complaint. Instead he prowled the safe house in tandem with the younger man, and kept his feelings to himself... The long hours passed slowly; hours of tactical and logistical planning and correlation, concentrated poring over maps, and the making of battle-plans in general. The techs were feeding questions to the computers, and supplying Trask and his SAS Commanders with the answers; apart from catching the occasional break, they would probably still be working well into the eleventh hour. Surface plans of Xanadu - together with schematics of the resort\u0027s sub-surface labyrinth - littered tables in the central Ops Room. Detailed diagrams, ordnance survey maps, and aerial photographs of Jethro Manchester\u0027s island in the Capricorn Group were scattered over the floor of a room with tightly drawn curtains.Warrant Officer Class Two Joe Davis was on a radio in the Ops Room, logging in the task force\u0027s vehicles as they arrived in groups or as individuals across the mountains and down onto the coastal strip. They had kept radio silence until now; even now they voiced only their call-signs - and then just the once, - received coded grid-references of their destinations, verified their receipt, and disappeared again into the aether. Soon they would be arriving at the designated operational locations, in which they would maintain low profiles and wait for orders. The big articulated Ops Truck wouldn\u0027t be in until the dead of night or early morning. But everyone would be, and must be, in situ by midday tomorrow, Monday, the night of the full moon ...By six in the evening Ben Trask was about ready to start pulling his hair out over his main problem with Xanadu. It was the one thing he couldn\u0027t request help on from higher authority (indeed, it was the one thing he daren\u0027t even mention to higher authority): how to evacuate the \u0027civilians\u0027 from the resort before attacking the place. For lan Goodly had forecast blood and thunder in Xanadu, and whether or not this was an accurate prediction or some scene from the past that the precog had somehow witnessed, Trask wasn\u0027t about to risk having his operation compromised, delayed, or possibly even shut down by the objections and vacillations of jittery political powers. It was nerve-racking; for from Trask\u0027s own point of view, and while it had been one thing to personally authorize, coordinate, and take part in a firefight in the badlands of the Gibson Desert, setting fire to Xanadu would be something else entirely! And since he didn\u0027t have time to argue the toss with the powers that be, it meant that, should anything go wrong tomorrow night, he would be the one to carry the can.Trask was desperately in need of a plan of evacuation, and it would have to be one that wouldn\u0027t alert Nephran Malinari to E-Branch\u0027s or any other enemy\u0027s hand in things. But with little more than twenty-four hours to go, no such plan seemed likely.Then came the televised evening news report - of the first cases of Asiatic Plague showing up in Brisbane and half a dozen other Australian ports - and with it the germ of an idea and a possible reprieve. It was Liz Merrick who heard the report, formulated the idea, and brought it to Trask\u0027s attention. At first he was doubtful; the notion seemed too contrived, too Hollywood ... but it was the sort of idea that can grow on you. And as it grew on Trask, so he got to work on it.For after all, it was all that he had to work on ...Later, in the early hours of the night, when it was cooler and Liz went outdoors for a breath of fresh air, Jake took the opportunity to corner her and have a word in private.\u0027You\u0027ve been avoiding me all day/ he said. \u0027Sort of peculiar behaviour for a partner, partner. Or is it wearing off?\u0027Seated together on a bench, they were close but not touching. Liz gave him a wary look, and said. \u0027Umm? Wearing off?\u0027\u0027I thought we had something special going,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027Er, business-wise, that is. I mean, psychically if not physically.\u0027She smiled (a little ruefully, he thought) and said, \u0027Perhaps physically, too, under different circumstances. So don\u0027t underestimate yourself, Jake Cutter. But you\u0027re carrying a lot of baggage around with you, and the extra weight is taking too much of a toll on you. You haven\u0027t been the most sociable type, you know? And even if you were, this isn\u0027t the best of times.\u0027 \u0027Which disposes of physically,\u0027 he said. \u0027But there\u0027s still psychically to consider. I thought you were interested in that side of me, too - or should that be \"at least?\"\u0027 With which he felt her shy away from him, as her expression became a lot more serious. But then she gave a shrug, and said: \u0027Out in the desert, that first job of ours was like an initiation, a baptism by fire - for both of us. As we were working together and it was part of our job, it seemed only fitting and sensible that we develop something of a rapport. But - \u0027 \u0027Which we did,\u0027 he cut her off. \u0027So, is that finished now?\u0027 \u0027 - But,\u0027 Liz went on, \u0027for this thing tomorrow night we\u0027ve been split up, and since we\u0027re not going to be working together there seemed little point in us, well, working together! I mean, with this twin operation about to go down, Xanadu and the Capricorn Group island thing together, letting anything else get in the way would have been too much of a distraction. So I haven\u0027t been trying to avoid you, Jake. It\u0027s simply that we\u0027ve all been very busy.\u0027 \u0027You have all been busy!\u0027 said Jake, moodily. And abruptly: \u0027I\u0027m not... not having a good time of this.\u0027\u0027Of this conversation?\u0027\u0027And of everything else,\u0027 he answered. Then shook his head and said, \u0027Christ! Do I come off sounding like a cry-baby?\u0027 And suddenly Liz found herself melting. It was the first time that Jake had shown any open wounds - in his waking hours, anyway - and here she was pouring salt in them with her deliberately detached, overly cool attitude! And so: \u0027What is the problem, Jake?\u0027 she said.With which he felt that oh-so-tender telepathic aura probing in his direction, and immediately raised his shields. She knew it, drew back from him, said, \u0027Is that what it\u0027s about? But I can\u0027t help what I am, Jake! If someone close to me is hurting, surely it\u0027s only natural that I should want to know why? And anyway, isn\u0027t it a contradiction? You were the one who brought up our telepathic rapport, this special \"thing\" that we have going! But you can\u0027t expect anyone to be close to you, concerned for you on the one hand, while deliberately pushing them away on the other. You\u0027re shielding yourself - and from contact with me, Jake!\u0027 He nodded, and said, \u0027And if contact -1 suppose we can call it that for now, instead of spying - if contact gets to be a habit, what then? Look, Liz, last night I had a bloody awful nightmare, a piece of the extra luggage you were talking about, that\u0027s the result of something I\u0027ve done. It was an act of vengeance, but a very terrible act. You say it\u0027s only natural you should want to know what\u0027s hurting, but please believe me, you really don\u0027t want to know about something like that!\u0027At which she scarcely managed to keep from biting her lip. For she already knew about that - all about it. But before she could say anything and perhaps give herself away, Jake went on: \u0027I think ... I thought, that maybe you were there with me, that you had seen, and that was why you were avoiding me.\u0027\u0027No,\u0027 Liz shook her head. \u0027I wasn\u0027t, I didn\u0027t, it isn\u0027t.\u0027And she thought: Damn you, Ben Trask! I know it\u0027s your job, but this is killing me! And at the same time she knew how fortunate she was that it wasn\u0027t Trask himself she was talking to!But even so (she tried to qualify her deceit), what she had told Jake was only a half-lie, or at worst a white one. For the real reason she had been avoiding him was because she knew that sooner or later she must remind him of that name, Korath.It would be the right and proper thing to do after all, for with all the emphasis that Jake had placed on it, it might well be important to everyone. But now she had gone and complicated matters, making herself an even bigger liar. For as soon as she mentioned that name to Jake and he remembered it, he would know that she really had been there after all, sneaking in his mind, like a thief!Right there and then she might have done it, blurted it out and accepted the consequences ... except at that precise moment Ben Trask appeared in the door to the house, calling, \u0027Liz? And is that you, Jake? O-group time. Come and get your orders.\u0027 Heading for the house, suddenly Liz found herself hating it all. But especially hating her weird talent, her telepathy. And more clearly than ever she understood why most E-Branch espers thought of their skills as curses. Again and again her condemnation of herself rang in her mind, but she heard it as an accusation, as ifspoken by Jake:\u0027Sneaking in my mind like a thief! - like a thief! - like a thief!\u0027 And she hated it, yes. For the fact of the matter was thatLiz valued him far too much for that. And not only psychically,either...Then it was Monday.By midday an observation post had been set up on the single approach road that angled up the mountain to Xanadu. In a tree-shrouded lay-by, it looked like a party of picknickers was enjoying the view and the mountain air. A table had been set up, and a small barbecue stand sent up smoke from where it stood on the stump of a tree. Cubes of meat sizzled on skewers, and a camera and six-pack of beer sat on the table. Two of the cans had been opened, one of which lay on its side. All very \u0027casual.\u0027Three men in light summer clothes ran the show. One of them was sitting in the car with the windows rolled down, apparently listening to the radio. In fact he was using a radio, or would be when it was required. Another soldier sat at the table, \u0027casually\u0027 watching the road where it zig-zagged up into the wooded heights. He wore binoculars round his neck but only rarely used them. The third member of the team carried a guitar. He perched on a stool in the shade of a pine, his broad-brimmed hat giving him a little extra cover as he strummed an inadequate, mainly tuneless tune out of his instrument, which was in fact capable of far more serious music. He was the team\u0027s \u0027minder,\u0027 and the sound-box of his guitar housed a deadly 9mm machine-pistol.So far, the man in the car had registered their call-sign and reported their situation only once, clearly and succinctly stating that they were \u0027In situ ...\u0027 Also at midday, Liz\u0027s Warrant Officer Class Two \u0027Red\u0027 Bygraves, and the tech Jimmy Harvey, had bought \u0027day visitor\u0027 tickets at Xanadu\u0027s gatehouse reception desk. By I p.m., having \u0027cased the joint\u0027 but oh-so-carefully, they were sunbathing on opposite sides of the main pool. Both men had taken an armful of local morning newspapers with them, with front-page spreads that dealt with the incursion of Asiatic Plague; these had been left in strategic locations where they were bound to be picked up and read. Of course the resort had its own newsvending outlets; Trask\u0027s news-sheet ploy was intended as a supplementary incentive once his evacuation scheme got in gear.As for the scheme: that was simplicity itself.At precisely 1:15 p.m. Bygraves got up and strolled round to Harvey\u0027s side of the pool, stepping carefully around or over the many tanned bodies lounging there. The two men were \u0027total strangers/ of course. Jimmy Harvey saw Bygraves coming, adjusted his dark glasses, and stretched his arms up above his head, letting the sun caress the pale underarm areas. And:\u0027Christ!\u0027 said Bygraves, going down on a knee beside him, staring at the dark, purplish blotches under Jimmy\u0027s arms.\u0027Eh?\u0027 Harvey sat up. \u0027What?\u0027\u0027Sir/ said Bygraves, \u0027would you mind if I examined those marks, that pustule?\u0027\u0027Marks? Pustule?\u0027\u0027Under your arms, sir. Because if they\u0027re what they look like...\u0027Harvey glanced under his arm, looked concerned. \u0027Is that something new?\u0027 he said. And, \u0027Who are you, anyway?\u0027\u0027Doctor Bygraves/ said the other, prodding beneath Harvey\u0027s left arm where he obligingly lifted it. And by now the people at the poolside were interested in what was going on.\u0027A doctor?\u0027 Harvey was starting to look worried. \u0027Specializing in communicable Asiatic diseases/ Bygraves nodded. \u0027I\u0027m up here for the day, before reporting for duty in Brisbane. And while I don\u0027t want to frighten you, right now it looks like I\u0027ll have my work cut out!\u0027 He pushed Harvey\u0027s arm down by his side and asked: \u0027How long have you been up here?\u0027 \u0027Just a fortnight/ Harvey was on his feet now. Tm taking my summer break. So what the hell\u0027s wrong?\u0027But \u0027suddenly\u0027 Bygraves became aware of the people gathering to watch the show. And he leaned closer to Harvey, bending down to whisper in the smaller man\u0027s ear.\u0027What?\u0027 Harvey yelped.\u0027But haven\u0027t you heard the news, read the newspapers?\u0027 Bygraves looked astonished, and more than ever worried. \u0027You say you\u0027ve been up here for two weeks? Then it\u0027s here. It has to be here! Have you seen any rats? Have you noticed any other people with these marks? Jesus, it could be in the water!\u0027\u0027Plague?\u0027 The word burst loudly from Harvey\u0027s mouth. \u0027Hey, did you say plague? But how in hell can I have - ?\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t say it!\u0027 Bygraves cut him short, glancing anxiously at the concerned faces all around. \u0027Listen, we have a serum. It isn\u0027t that serious if you get it seen to early - but I do mean right now! All of the medical facilities in this area have been supplied with the antidote. Unfortunately I don\u0027t have any with me, and this isn\u0027t a registered medical centre. So I can\u0027t give you any shots that will help here in Xanadu, but - \u0027As he set off in a hurry, with Harvey in tow, back around the pool to his sunbed, a small, anxious crowd began to follow on behind. Harvey caught up, grabbed his arm and said:\u0027But?\u0027 His jaw was beginning to flap. \u0027But what?\u0027Bygraves picked up a briefcase, went to open it and \u0027accidentally\u0027 spilled some of its contents: pamphlets describing the symptoms of Asiatic Plague, a new strain of bubonic. They fluttered to the crazy-paved pool surround and were quickly picked up by the gathering crowd. And looking hopeless, frustrated, Bygraves said, \u0027Look, I think we\u0027re probably too late to stop it spreading through this place, but you are already short on time.\u0027 Pulling on a pair of shorts over his swim trunks, he said. \u0027I have to get you out of this place now. And as for the rest of you people/ he glanced at the milling, gawping faces all around. \u0027This thing will work its way through this place like wildfire! So pass the message: you should all get out, go home, report to your hospitals, doctors, medical facilities - and you should do it now!\u0027 Then, to Harvey: \u0027My car\u0027s this way.\u0027\u0027But my clothes ...!\u0027 Harvey, whose clothes were in fact in their vehicle, started to protest.\u0027It\u0027s your clothes or your life!\u0027 said Bygraves, pushing a way through the crowd.Ten minutes later they were out of there, and fifteen minutes after that the general exodus began. And Red Bygraves was right: the thing worked its way through Xanadu like wildfire ...By that time Ben Trask and David Chung were at the observation point. They were on hand to greet WO II Bygraves and Jimmy Harvey when they came tearing down the road from Xanadu in a cloud of dust and heat-shimmer, pulled into the lay-by and braked to a halt behind the other car.\u0027How did it go?\u0027 Trask was anxious; he sluiced sweat from his brow, glanced up and down the road. Up there the mountains, and down below the coastal plain reaching to the vastly curving horizon of the South Pacific. Normally it would be a beautiful, exhilarating view, but Trask had no time for that right now.\u0027Some people were piling into their cars even as we pulled out of the place,\u0027 Jimmy Harvey said, keeping well down and out of sight inside the car. The dust was still settling. \u0027I think we made a good job of it. Thank God for amateur dramatics, eh? Would you believe I once played Romeo?\u0027Trask looked down at him and couldn\u0027t help but smile. \u0027No, but I\u0027d believe a munchkin!\u0027\u0027Eh?\u0027 Harvey grimaced as he pulled a blob of purplish cosmetic putty from under his left arm. \u0027 The Wizard of Oz,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027Probably before your time. How about the place? How did it look?\u0027 \u0027Like a resort.\u0027\u0027Nothing odd about it?\u0027\u0027No.\u0027 The other shook his bald dome of a head. \u0027Unless youconsider all those well-heeled people and all that tanned flesh odd. But me? I felt like a right whitey from Blighty!\u0027Trask shook his head, chewed on his upper lip. \u0027Why is it I\u0027m not happy?\u0027 he asked of no one in particular. \u0027Why is it so quiet? I don\u0027t know ... but something doesn\u0027t feel right.\u0027 And to Jimmy: \u0027Time you got some clothes on, and wear a hat. We\u0027re out of here as soon as people start to exit the place, or we\u0027ll get snarled up in the traffic. That is, if people start to exit the place!\u0027The locator David Chung was at the side of the road. Lowering binoculars from his eyes, he called out, \u0027Ben, here they come! A whole stream of cars on the high zig-zag up there. Ten minutes and they\u0027ll be here.\u0027 He came at a run across the lay-by\u0027s gravel surface.WO II Bygraves had changed his T-shirt, put on a baseball cap and sunglasses. He slid out of the driver\u0027s seat and Trask got in. Now Bygraves would take over as the commander of this sub-section, making its numbers up to four. And they\u0027d be here until they were ordered on up to Xanadu. There were sufficient armaments in their vehicle to start World War III.Trask spoke to Chung. \u0027What do you make of it?\u0027\u0027He\u0027s up there, definitely,\u0027 said Chung. \u0027At this range I can\u0027t be mistaken. Mindsmog, and dense. But it\u0027s so steady - I mean, it registers like steady breathing, you know? - that at a guess I\u0027d say he\u0027s asleep. Which at this time of day shouldn\u0027t come as a surprise. But Ben, hear me out: I think there\u0027s more smog than just his.\u0027 Vampires!\u0027 said Trask, emphasizing the plural. \u0027Lieutenants? Thralls? How many?\u0027 \u0027Him, and maybe two others. I can\u0027t be sure. But they\u0027re weak, too weak to be lieutenants. Again I\u0027m guessing, but I\u0027d say they\u0027re raw recruits, thralls.\u0027Trask shook his head. \u0027It still feels wrong. Too easy. I have this feeling he knows about us, that this whole scenario is - I don\u0027t know - a lie?\u0027 Chung shrugged, but not negligently. \u0027That\u0027s your department, boss. I can\u0027t help you.\u0027 Trask gave himself a shake, tried to tell himself he was wrong. And anyway, there was nothing he could do about it now. Tonight was their window of opportunity, and it had been \u0027foreseen\u0027 by lan Goodly. So from now on it was all go, go, go.\u0027David,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027I won\u0027t be seeing you until I come in with Chopper One, after dark. Take care to stay tuned, old friend. And lead these people right to their target, right?\u0027\u0027You\u0027ve got it,\u0027 Chung answered, as the first car out of Xanadu sped in a cloud of dust past the lay-by and on down the often precipitous road.\u0027You\u0027d better be on your way,\u0027 Chung nodded. \u0027Good luck, Ben.\u0027But then a strange thing. A car coming in the other direction, up the mountain road, pulled in sharply onto the lay-by\u0027s gravel surface and skidded to a halt.The driver cursed out of his open window, said, \u0027Did you see that? If it wasn\u0027t for this lay-by I\u0027d be over the fucking edge! I mean, God damn it to ...!\u0027 He had been forced off the road by someone trying to overtake the lead cars in the exodus from Xanadu. \u0027What the fuck is going on up there?\u0027Trask stared hard out of his own vehicle\u0027s window at the speaker - at his angular, somehow spidery figure, that seemed crammed into the seat of his battered, blue-grey, Range Rover-styled vehicle -and for a moment knew a sensation of deja vu. The man wore an open-necked shirt and a wide-brimmed hat, and the way he crouched over the steering wheel like that, he had to be pretty tall.Tall and spidery, and his vehicle was ...Trask stared harder, and the tall thin man stared back - but only for a moment. Then his eyes went wide and the back of his vehicle fishtailed as he slammed her in first, revved up, and slewed back out onto the road. And: \u0027Damn!\u0027 Trask shouted, getting out of his car as the dust of the other\u0027s departure drifted back to earth. \u0027Deja vu nothing! That car, and that man - they fit Liz Merrick\u0027s description of the watcher at the airport where we came in!\u0027 Even as the suspect car had fishtailed out onto the road, so the SAS type with the guitar had yanked open the boot of the observation post\u0027s vehicle and hauled out an evil-looking piece of artillery. Quickly assuming a firing stance behind a stunted pine, he rested the rifle\u0027s long barrel on the gnarled stump of a branch. And sweeping the steeply snaking road, he made adjustments to the telescopic sights. Then: \u0027Mr Trask,\u0027 he shouted. \u0027Up there where the road zig-zags. I can take him out as he rounds that last bend. The range isn\u0027t too much, maybe five hundred yards, and this weapon is lethally accurate to fifteen hundred. That\u0027s to assume a stationary target, of course. But I\u0027m qualified with this gun and won\u0027t miss. Once he\u0027s over that ridge, though, he\u0027s gone with the wind. You have maybe thirty seconds to think it over.\u0027Trask thought it over. He knew he was right - but what if he was wrong? What if the spidery man was an innocent? But then again, why had he taken off like that? And the look on his face - probably shock as he\u0027d realized he was face to face with his master\u0027s enemy. In which case he\u0027d be on his way to make report to Malinari even now. But if Trask was wrong... how to balance one life against the security of a world?The man with the sniperscope yelled, \u0027He\u0027ll be coming into view any time now!\u0027And Trask thought: The die is cast. We\u0027ve got Nephran Malinari trapped up there. He can\u0027t come out until sundown, and Lan Goodly has forecast shit and hellfirefor tonight, the night of the full moon. So what difference does this make one way or the other?What was it that the precog was always saying - something about the future being as immutable as the past? \u0027What will be has been,\u0027 and all that? Yes, that was it... but it was always coupled with, \u0027There\u0027s no way of telling how it will be, that\u0027s all...\u0027Trask started towards the marksman\u0027s position, and in his mind\u0027s eye he saw the knuckle of the man\u0027s finger turning white on the trigger. As if that were some kind of invocation, the marksman called out, \u0027I have him in my sights now, Mr Trask.\u0027 There was no time left, and Trask skidded to a halt shouting, \u0027Do it! Take him out!\u0027 But:\u0027Skit!\u0027 said the other. His finger went slack on the trigger, and beads of sweat sprang into being on his forehead. Letting his weapon slump, he said, \u0027Cars out of Xanadu, a fucking convoy! They were in my way, shielding him. Ordinary civilians. No way I was going to risk firing on them.\u0027Trask had been holding his breath. Now he let it out in a long \u0027Phew!3 and then said, \u0027Take it easy. It isn\u0027t your fault, and it wasn\u0027t meant to be. The future can be like that.\u0027\u0027What?\u0027 said the other, relieved but frowning. \u0027Some kind of fatalism?\u0027\u0027Forget it,\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027But tonight, if you see that car or its driver in the resort, then you can fire on them with all you\u0027ve got. And ditto should they try to come back down out of there.\u0027Then it was time for a final word with Bygraves and Chung, before the downhill traffic got too heavy. Even now the thunder of fleeing vehicles was becoming deafening.\u0027It looks like our little scheme is going to work,\u0027 Trask told Bygraves. \u0027Stay on it, and when the traffic thins out flag down a car. See if you can get some idea of how many people are still up there. As for that fellow who slipped through our fingers a moment ago: don\u0027t let it worry you. I\u0027ll do the worrying for all of us. And anyway, what can he tell Malinari other than what he\u0027s already figured out for himself - or will figure out just as soon as he pops up from his hidey-hole?\u0027Then he turned to Chung. \u0027David, stay tuned. If that mindsmog gets active, starts moving about, let us know at once. But whether it does or doesn\u0027t, and unless something really drastic happens, we\u0027ll probably be going in as planned. Okay?\u0027 After the WO II and Chung had nodded their understanding, Trask got back into the car with Jimmy Harvey and drove to the side of the road. There he waited for a break in the stream of traffic, gave a final wave and set off downhill. The vast bulk of the exodus was still to come ... And in a Xanadu that would soon be empty of entirely human life, there were just three and a half hours of life-giving, or wn-life threatening, natural light left. Then the sun would dip westward, the shadows of the mountain range would lengthen, and Xanadu\u0027s lights would blink on one by one, holding the darkness and the long night to follow at bay. Or at least, that was how it would be under normal circumstances ... It was some eighty miles back to the safe house. Along the way Jimmy Harvey radioed ahead to give the people back there their ETA. He also passed a brief, coded message concerning Liz Merrick\u0027s watcher, and likewise passed on the locator David Chung\u0027s expert opinion that Lord Nephran Malinari was indeed in Xanadu. At which the team at the safe house held a final o-group, then went into action to ensure that everything would be fully operational and ready for Trask on his return. Radio messages went out. With the exception of the Xanadu observation post, the various SAS units began converging on the flying club where Chopper Two had been checked over, refuelled, and was warming up for the long flight to Gladstone. The other machine stood idle for the moment; its flight to Xanadu would be of much shorter duration. Meanwhile, in the harbour at Gladstone, a fully-fuelled coastguard vessel and pilot had gone on immediate standby. And every man who formed a part of the team was fully aware of the details of the job in hand ...5:15 p.m. in Xanadu, and for more than three hours now private eye Garth Santeson had been trying to get to see his employer, Aristode Milan. But Santeson wasn\u0027t the only employee, and the two well-built young men who saw to Milan\u0027s privacy in daylight hours had been proving obstinate. For three hours and then some Santeson had prowled the casino and watched it emptying of punters, hostesses, croupiers and their overseers, and finally and most tellingly the tellers. For when the people who handled the cash moved out, then you knew for sure that something was about to go down.Half an hour ago, turned back yet again by Milan\u0027s single-minded minders from his daytime sanctum sanctorum, Santeson had gone out from the almost deserted Pleasure Dome into the resort proper. By then the pools had been empty and the last cars were straggling out through the departure gate. The private investigator was no fool; he had long since found out what the alleged problem was, but he\u0027d also made the connection between that and what he\u0027d bumped into on the mountain approach road. And it was just too much of a coincidence. So how come Milan - who had definitely been on the alert for unfriendly visitors and suspicious activities for as long as Santeson had been with him - how come he wasn\u0027t up and about, checking things out for himself?Or was he simply unaware that there was a problem ... ?The trouble with Milan\u0027s goons was that they had insufficient grey matter between them to realize they should at least be doing something, if it was only to let their dodgy employer know what was happening here. This was Santeson\u0027s opinion, anyway, which seemed borne out by the dumb, unswerving obstinacy of the pair. Normally he would have been able to contact Milan by telephone; the photophobic, night-dwelling boss of the resort would usually accept calls through the dark hours from four-thirty or five in the evening until nine in the morning, but not tonight And when Santeson had tried to impress something of the urgency of an audience with Milan upon his watchdogs - the fact that he must see him, that his information was of the utmost importance - it had seemed to him that they couldn\u0027t care less! He\u0027d simply been informed of Mr Milan\u0027s instructions: that he wasn\u0027t to be disturbed under any circumstance until 6:30 at the earliest And that had been that. But now, with the time approaching 6:00 p.m. and the resort already dark, cooling under the swift onset of a Tropic of Capricorn night, Santeson was determined to have his way. He had last tried to call Milan just ten minutes ago from the deserted booth at the monorail boarding stage close to the casino\u0027s entrance ... but the phone had only buzzed annoyingly at him, because by then there had been no receptionist to transfer the call! And now Santeson was very angry, for as the minutes had stretched into hours his sense of urgency - the anxious frustration of knowing that while something was definitely and dangerously out of kilter here, still there was nothing he could do about it - had increased in commensurate degree. Garth Santeson had his own ideas as to what was happening or about to happen; it seemed obvious to him that the long arm of the law was reaching for Milan, and his oh-so-shady employer was about to get himself arrested (probably for skimming casino profits); in which case Santeson\u0027s monthly and more than adequate pay cheque would disappear with him. It therefore followed that the longer he kept the boss out of trouble, the better his chances of collecting his next cheque, due in a few days\u0027 time. Which in turn meant he must speak to Milan about the people he had seen on the approach road, at least two of which he\u0027d recognized from the party that had flown in a few days ago in those paramilitary jet-copters.Santeson knew where Milan was - his approximate location, anyway - but couldn\u0027t get to him. On any ordinary night Milan might be found in the casino for an hour or two, but much preferred the privacy of his rooms in the solar-panelled bubble on top of the dome (which on rare occasions he would also use during daylight hours). Santeson had a special elevator key, given him by Milan, which would take him to those topmost rooms when he was summoned into the man\u0027s presence. But generally, during the day, Aristotle Milan stayed well out of sight, down in the subterranean bowels of the place. Santeson understood that his employer had private apartments down there, to which he wasn\u0027t and never had been privy. To his knowledge, only Milan\u0027s goons had ever got that close - - Well, until tonight, anyway ...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-31.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
