{"id":97232,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"The StormingSituated one hundred and sixty yards from where the coastguard vessel had beached, and set well back from the high-water mark behind massively thick, fortress-like rock walls in four acres of landscaped rockeries and gardens watered from a small desalination unit, Jethro Manchester\u0027s two-storey villa was a luxurious, custom-built dwelling.Standing central on a jutting promontory, the house was of timber and natural stone, mainly fossilized coral. It had been built from imported teak and dynamited rubble from a channel blasted through to a rocky inlet on the other side of the promontory. In style it was part sprawling Roman villa, part Austrian chalet. Manchester\u0027s yacht - by his standards a \u0027modest\u0027 thirty-five footer - was moored in a roofed-over lock in the artificial channel, midway between the villa and the sea.\n These features were visible from the air, where at five hundred feet Chopper Two\u0027s pilot stood his machine off like a hawk and viewed them through its eyes, sensitive night-vision scanners. Every few seconds he would flip a switch to convert his screen to infrared and thermal imaging. All of the men on the ground were wearing headsets; the pilot was able to talk to them individually or as a group.\n All subterfuge had been thrown to the wind now; the airborne party was safely down, and the boat had landed itscrew without hindrance. Now the task force would deploy into a semicircle to isolate the promontory, and move in on the house. If the target group had seen the boat\u0027s \u0027fire\u0027 or emergency flare - or if they had heard the chopper\u0027s low, prowler-mode throb and came out of the house to see what was happening or perhaps to take defensive action - then the men on the ground would be able to answer the threat without fear of firing on each other.With his machine on autopilot, the pilot\u0027s attention was rapt on his viewers. For now, in addition to the central, gently fluctuating orange glow of the house, the dark-green terrain of his screen was lit by smaller blobs of human heat.He saw two figures, fast-moving and crouching low, about to leave the narrow strip of beach and enter an area of landscaped rocks and foliage east of the villa. They were heading for one of the regular breaks in the wall. And the pilot knew that the four-man boat party had split into two two-man teams. This was one of them; they would be equipped with their usual weapons, and one of them would be carrying a flame-thrower.But as the pilot scanned ahead of them, suddenly, as if from nowhere, he picked up two more figures. They were in the shrubbery or under cover of the trees, but they were making a lot of heat! The writhing, blob-like shapes on the screen merged, drew apart, melted together again ... a repetitious, oddly sexual-looking activity. The men from the boat were heading directly towards it and at some speed, and the pilot was almost too late to advise them:\u0027Boat party east of the house. There\u0027s some fucking thing directly ahead of you!\u0027 He couldn\u0027t know it but he was absolutely right.\n On the ground, the NCOs spied sudden, apparently startled movement. It was dark, but not that dark, and the almost luminous tangle of flesh on a blanket under the bower-like branches of a tall, flowering shrub was unmistakable: the naked figures of a couple making love. Or they had been but now sprang apart.\n \u0027What the... P\u0027The man sat upright, and the girl tried to cover herself and gave a small, warbling cry. The scene was so authentic and natural, and the couple seemed so vulnerable, it was the SAS men who were taken by surprise.\u0027Bloody hell ... I\u0027 said one of them, his jaw falling open. And his companion actually turned aside the barrel of his weapon a little, deflecting it from the pair and easing his finger off the trigger. Surprise, yes - momentary disorientation and confusion - the only advantage a vampire could ever ask for or require. And:\u0027Oh, thank God!\u0027 cried the girl, as she threw herself forward and sprawled at the feet of one of the soldiers. \u0027Help me! Please help me! He was raping me!\u0027 A lie, which of course fell naturally from her lips.But at the same time the naked man\u0027s arm swept up, to aim and fire a short-barrelled, compressed-air speargun. The spearhead was a trident with four-inch tines; all three of them took the off-guard soldier in his throat. And gurgling, clawing one-handed at the short spear in his crimson-spurting neck, he fell over backward and let loose a burst of automatic fire uselessly into the sky.The other soldier had reached down almost instinctively to lift the girl to her feet. But even in the act of gathering her up he saw his colleague shot, and simultaneously the feral yellow fire in the naked man\u0027s eyes as he flowed sinuously upright and drew back his arm to use the speargun as a club.\n No further reminder was necessary. The soldier cursed and put the naked girl aside, then opened up with a burst of explosive shells that lifted the vampire from his feet, ripped into him in mid-air, and threw him backward into the shrub. There he hung in a tangle of crushed foliage, until branches snapped and he fell to the ground. And as he sat there - groping among his own intestines and mewling his undead agony - so the gibbering NCO cursed again and put a single shell right between his eyes.\n The contents of the vampire\u0027s head went every which way as the shrub collapsed on him.Meanwhile the downed man had stopped writhing and tugging at the spear in his throat; he lay dead still, dead of shock or from choking on his own blood.And the girl had disappeared into the night...Fleeing, sobbing, gasping for air - with her sliced feet leaving a trail of blood on the often jagged stones - Julie Lennox somehow managed to avoid the second pair of men from the coastguard vessel, and came across Jake and Lardis instead. With her night eyes, the eyes of a vampire, she saw them before they saw her: an old man and his younger colleague, in the garden, keeping low and making their way silently toward the house. And she remembered some advice that she\u0027d been given:\u0027When they come, and they will come,\u0027 (Martin Trennier had told Jethro Manchester and his small family group just an hour or so ago), \u0027there won\u0027t be any mercy. They\u0027ll come to kill you. And while you might not believe it now, you won\u0027t want them to! For you have a Great Vampire\u0027s blood in you, and in its own way it is alive, too. It wants to live, and it won\u0027t let you commit suicide - which means that you can\u0027t simply give yourselves up to these men. Ergo, you\u0027ll fight. And the more of them that you kill, the longer you\u0027ll stay alive.\u0027With which he had rammed a handful of shells deep into the magazine of an ugly pump-action shotgun, and jerked once on its heavy wooden stock to arm it, before continuing:\n \u0027Now, while I know that some of you are still fighting the good fight, the fact is we can grow strong on our enemies - on the blood of our enemies - and the stronger we grow, the better our chances of survival. So that\u0027s it, now you know what to do. I have nothing more to say, except that I for one intend to survive. So go on, get busy. Prepare yourselves with whatever grit or cunning your vampire blood has bestowed, arm yourselves with whatever weapons you can find, and wait. It\u0027s just as simple as that.\u0027\n But in fact it wasn\u0027t simple at all. Simple, perhaps, for Martin Trennier, one of the first taken by Aristotle Milan and utterly in thrall to him, but not for Julie; not now that Alan Manchester, Jethro\u0027s son, was dead. Julie and Alan ... how they had loved each other, and how desperately hard they had fought to cling to their humanity. But all in vain.Alan had turned first, and now he was dead and gone, taken from her, and these merciless invaders were responsible - weren\u0027t they? Deep in her heart, she knew they weren\u0027t; and yet, as moment by moment Trennier\u0027s words made more sense, so the vampire essence in Julie\u0027s system worked on her, turning her, too.Trennier had done it to her, done it to them all: a simple bite was all it took - and time. For Trennier was barely a lieutenant himself, and a weak one at that. Made by Milan, he had been given a minimum of essence, and so he\u0027d been a thrall for long and long. But as the evil had grown in him, so he\u0027d taken on stature, guile, strength. And thus he\u0027d become Milan\u0027s lieutenant, to watch over the Manchesters on their island retreat. Or as it was now, their prison.When they had known their end was near, Julie and Alan had come out into the night, into the garden, to make love just one last time. They hadn\u0027t reckoned on being found so quickly, that was all. Not in their own secret place, in the garden, on their prison island. Their prison, yes ... indeed, their death cell.Or perhaps not. For as the blood is the life, so there was plenty of hot blood in these two men. And without warning, suddenly Julie caught herself licking her lips in anticipation. At which she knew that it was too late for her, and that it always had been. But strangely - and as swiftly as that - she no longer cared, for she was now awake! As for what had awakened her:\n Perhaps it had been the sight and salty smell of Alan Manchester\u0027s blood, or that of the soldier whom he\u0027d shot with his speargun, or both. Which-, or what-ever, it had acted on Julie as a catalyst, and now the \u0027good fight\u0027 was over. She was what she was and would do what she must do. She moved like a wraith towards the two men, got behind them where they crept carefully forward, making for the villa\u0027s lights.She got closer and closer to them, her hands raised, with nails like poisonous claws - indeed, they were poisonous claws - poised and ready to strike ...... But in that same moment Julie found herself betrayed, and by three things:One, the full moon, emerging from behind fleeting clouds, to sweep a silver swath over the sea and the land. Two, by the sharp stutter of automatic gunfire, sounding from a short distance to the west. And three, by a watchful, dragonfly spy-in-the-sky, hovering on high as it sent an urgent message to Julie\u0027s would-be victims:\u0027Central team. Why are there three of you? Do you have a tail?\u0027 Fading in and out, the pilot\u0027s words were hard to read.Lardis didn\u0027t understand the message, but Jake, startled by the gunfire and the near-distant cries that accompanied it, turned and saw...... A girl? A distraught, naked girl?For seeing him beginning his turn, Julie had drawn back, shrunk down into herself, begun to sob and scream. \u0027I was in the house,\u0027 she sobbed, trying to cover herself as if ashamed of her nakedness. \u0027They kept me prisoner there. But when they heard your helicopter they stopped watching me, and I ... and ... I... oh!\u0027She feigned a swoon, and Jake - forgetting all that he\u0027d seen, all that he\u0027d been told - put up his weapon and stepped forward.\n She clung to him for a moment, this beautiful girl, who was naked and frightened and so pale in the flooding light of the moon ... so pale and so cold. This girl whose grip on his combat suit was like iron, and whose nose was suddenly wrinkling suspiciously as she smelled garlic, and whose eyes were a reflective yellow, sulphurous in the night!\n Julie held the front of his jacket bunched in one hand, drew back the other hand until Jake saw its nails, sharpened and bevelled to gouges that would cut bloody channels in his face as easily as a routing machine! And her awful smile: the way her lips curled back from gleaming teeth.Jake tried to bring his machine-pistol to bear, to centre its muzzle on Julie\u0027s body. But she was faster; she knocked it away, out of his grasp. And now her \u0027smile\u0027 was a fixed, nightmarish grimace - but whether of horror or of pleasure in her own terrible strength, Jake couldn\u0027t say. Nor could he do anything about it.But Lardis could.An \u0027old man,\u0027 Lardis Lidesci had been ignored and almost forgotten by the girl. A mistake, for he was an old man with a difference. He was the Old Lidesci, and not nearly as naive as Jake. Not in the ways of vampires.Jake saw that slender, incredibly strong hand lift up before his face, tried to draw back from it and couldn\u0027t. He saw the fingers crook, could almost feel their rake, and knew that he was going to feel it. But then, in a moment, the look on her face changed. And she sighed.She sighed, then smiled again, but a real smile now. And a dribble of blood spilled from the corner of her mouth. Her hand straightened out - reached out to touch his face - but just a touch, almost a caress. Then her grip relaxed, her eyes rolled up, and she toppled away from him.Lardis Lidesci stood ten feet away, but his machete stood much closer than that; it stood up from the girl\u0027s back, where it had split her spinal column.\u0027Get your gun,\u0027 Lardis growled, and Jake began to breathe again after what had seemed like an hour of holding his breath. \u0027Get your gun and put it in her mouth ... and finish it.\u0027\n Jake was numb; his hands were numb as he took up his machine-pistol. \u0027But...\u0027 he started to say.\n \u0027But nothing!\u0027 Lardis snarled. \u0027Do it, and be sure to turn your face away.\u0027Just before Jake did it, Julie stopped her fitful, agonized writhing, saw the weapon\u0027s muzzle approaching her face, said something that Jake couldn\u0027t hear, just a breath of air. But he was sure that her lips formed the words, \u0027Thank you ...\u0027By then there was plenty of shouting and shooting, the hissing of flame-throwers, great gouts of fire and columns of smoke, all of it towards the centre of the promontory, at the villa itself. And full moon or none, it would have made no difference; bright orange and yellow flames were leaping, and all the shadows cast back in Jethro Manchester\u0027s gardens and rockeries.Lardis and Jake were the last to get there, but two of the SAS men would never get there. Close to the house, itself burning, they came across W.O. II Joe Davis and one of his men. The NCO had a flame-thrower and was watching the house. Davis was on one knee, looking at a pair of crumpled figures. His hands kept reaching, and drawing back without touching. And his hands were trembling.\u0027Get up from there,\u0027 said Lardis. \u0027Back away. Let me see.\u0027Davis looked up at Lardis through moist eyes; he was holding on, but only just, to would-be runaway emotions. His Adam\u0027s apple rose and fell, rose and fell, as he fought not to betray himself. \u0027Old man,\u0027 he said, his voice on the point of breaking. \u0027I trained this man, this boy. He was one of mine. But I didn\u0027t train him for this.\u0027Lardis pulled him away, muttering, \u0027What could anyone have taught him? There is no training for this kind of thing, except on the field of battle. The trouble with that is we only learn when we lose.\u0027\n He looked at the mess on the ground. Part of it, the body of a mature woman in a once-white dress, was a mound of raw red flesh. Riddled with bullets - some of which had exploded - she had been torn apart from within. Her face wasn\u0027t there, and her lower body seemed to have burst outwards. Lying under her where she\u0027d fallen, a young soldier in combat clothing stared blindly up into the sky. His brains had been split by a bright shining cleaver that was still buried in his skull.But even as Lardis looked, the woman\u0027s arms twitched where they clasped her victim, and one foot shuddered and vibrated in a shoe with a broken heel. Jerkily, spastically, her chest rose and fell, as bubbles formed in the liquid red mask of her face.\u0027Did you touch ... any of this?\u0027 Lardis looked up at Davis. The other shook his head. Then Lardis stood up, stood back, and turned to the man with the flame-thrower. \u0027Burn it,\u0027 he said.The man looked at his leader, who in turn looked at Lardis almost pleadingly. And Lardis said, \u0027Their blood is mixed. Your man\u0027s corpse is contaminated. Take no chances. Burn it all...\u0027As they moved away from the heat and the stench, Davis got hold of his emotions and said, Tve got men on both sides, in front and at the back of the house. No one\u0027s getting out of there. As far as I know that woman was only our second kill. My kill. God help me, I did that to her!\u0027\u0027No/ Lardis shook his grisly head. \u0027Don\u0027t ask your god for help. She needed help, and you gave it to her. Also, it was the third kill. We\u0027ve done one, too. A girl, back there in the garden. So you\u0027re not the only one who\u0027s feeling sick.\u0027And Jake said, \u0027Who was the other?\u0027\u0027When I killed ... that one,\u0027 Davis answered, with a glance over his shoulder, \u0027there was a scream from the house. A man in a gable window; he ranted and raved at us, tore his hair like a madman. Can\u0027t say I blame him. I think the woman must have been his wife. One of my lads fired a grenade in there with him, and it blew the gable to hell. Whoever he was, I\u0027m guessing he went with it. But if he didn\u0027t he\u0027ll burn anyway. Look.\u0027\n They looked back, and by then the front of the villa was an inferno. \u0027It\u0027ll be the same at the back,\u0027 said the Warrant Officer. \u0027They have orders to raze it.\u0027\n \u0027But that still leaves three to go,\u0027 said Jake.\u0027Two/ a voice called out, as a man came stumbling from theshadows. He was very pale, and he was carrying his own weapons, someone else\u0027s, and a flame-thrower. \u0027I got a young guy - I blew the fucker\u0027s head off! - but not before he got Bill Powers. My old mate\u0027s dead! ... But there was a girl, too. She got away.\u0027 \u0027No/ Jake shook his head. \u0027She didn\u0027t.\u0027 And: \u0027Two to go/ said Lardis. \u0027But where are they?\u0027 Right on cue, their radio headsets came alive in a crackle of static like frying bacon. And: \u0027Shit, shit, shit!\u0027 a frantic voice called. \u0027Can\u0027t anyone fucking hear me?\u0027And Davis said, \u0027Hawkeye, this is Road Runner. Where\u0027ve you been?\u0027\u0027Where\u0027ve / been?\u0027 the pilot at once came back, his relief plainly audible, despite that his voice kept fading in and out. \u0027I\u0027ve been sitting up here listening to you! The radio\u0027s on the blink. I\u0027m receiving but having difficulty sending. Now listen, I\u0027ve also had problems with the thermal imaging... the heat from that bonfire down there. I sorted that, but now there are life-signs at the boat, two of them. If they\u0027re not your people, they have to be the ones you\u0027re looking for/\u0027Show us the way to the yacht/ Davis snapped, now fully in command again. \u0027But if it gets away from us and makes a run for the sea, take it out. Bomb the bastard right out of the water!\u0027 \u0027Roger that/ and the signal faded to nothing - - But in another moment searchlight beams lanced down from on high, pierced the night and converged, swung west and traced a path along the channel to the sea ...In Xanadu, fifteen minutes earlier:\n Malinari had been tempted from the moment Chopper One descended into the garden. The way it hovered, mere feet above the ground, with its pontoons occasionally touching down, while its task-force contingent rapidly disembarked, regrouped into pairs and fanned out toward the casino: all it would have taken was a little pressure - literally the flip of a switch - and Malinari\u0027s worst enemies in this world would have been gone forever. Or most of them. Only the group from the vehicle would be left alive, to be dealt with at his convenience.The way his fingers had caressed the array of switches - almost lovingly, certainly lustfully - it had been a moment of great temptation, yes. But no, it would have been too easy, and this Trask and his men would have learned nothing of terror, or the merest moment of terror, perhaps, before oblivion. And that just wasn\u0027t good enough.Malinari wanted them to understand something of his superiority, wanted them to know they were trapped, even as they had thought to trap him. Then, if there were survivors of his holocaust, and when the flying machine returned to pick them up ... time enough then for the grand coup de grace, the final stroke of genius.And meanwhile, things had progressed more or less as planned, and Malinari employed his mentalism (but as little as possible) to stay in touch with events as they unfurled.For his telepathy wasn\u0027t without its own problems. Indeed, it was a two-edged sword. For one thing, it brought pain: listening to the thoughts of others was painful. And for another - and most importantly - Lord Malinari himself, his location in the face of the mountain, might be detected and jeopardized if he were to give full rein to his mentalism. For he had learned something (not enough by any means, but something) of the esoteric talents of Trask and this E-Branch from the Foener woman before he\u0027d killed her in the sump of that watercourse. And he had found out a lot more since then, mainly by trial and error.\n But it had been ngreat error to open his mind and accept Bruce Trennier\u0027s agonized communication - his final communication - when these people had tracked him down to the Gibson Desert. For, even as Malinari had felt the heat of his lieutenant\u0027s funeral pyre, so he\u0027d known a different kind of heat: that of discovery, when a probe reached out from halfway around the world to seek him out, zeroing in on him like a Starside bat searching for a juicy moth, or a Sunside hawk stooping to its prey.\n A mind had touched his, and left its fingerprint, its signature there, so that he would know it again. And in this last few days he had come to know it only too well. Now it was here in Xanadu, but if he studied it too closely, and if it were to lock on to his location - - That flying machine, that jet-copter, was equipped with armaments that could cut through the false facade of this hollow chimney like a battle gauntlet through the ribs of a disobedient thrall! But it all added to the excitement, the thrill of the game, what little it afforded him: their weird talents, and their puny human minds, against The Mind himself...So, this seeker, bloodhound, locator, or whatever he was, was one problem - and his talent was one that Nephran Malinari understood readily enough, for he had used just such skills in Sunside four hundred years ago to seek out the Szgany in their hiding places - but the locator\u0027s wild talent wasn\u0027t the only one that this E-Branch commanded, and it wasn\u0027t the only problem. Zek Foener\u0027s mind had been full of such things.A man who could see the future, for example (though obviously he couldn\u0027t see it too clearly, else he would never have come here to die), and Trask himself, to whom a lie was like a slap in the face ... there would be no deceiving that one! And as for mentalists: no lack of those. Well, that last wasn\u0027t so rare; even the Szgany had something of that in them. It was in their blood, a legacy of their centuries under Wamphyri domination. But these E-Branch people weren\u0027t Szgany. No, they were adepts, much as Malinari was an adept, but lacking the advantage of his several ... refinements? And of course without the ultimate advantage of being Wamphyri!\n Take Zek herself, for instance. What? A woman who could reach out her thoughts across the whole world with such crystal clarity as to be able to speak to a man like Trask - not himself a mentalist - and make him to understand? Oh, he was a loved one, and so there had probably been an element of rapport in it, such as is found in twins. But still and all, that was a talent!\n Or it had been ...Adepts, rivals, enemies, and bloodhound trackers who would never let go. All the more reason why they must go, and tonight. But it would have been so useful to know more about them first. Such people as this precog, and this locator, and Ben Trask himself... and this girl.The girl, yes ...She wasn\u0027t an adept, not yet; she hadn\u0027t attained Zek Foener\u0027s level of achievement. But to another telepathic mind (for instance, Malinari\u0027s mind) she was like a small flame guttering in the psychic aether, and he had sensed her there from the moment these people arrived in Brisbane. But at such close proximity - because she was close now, and inexperienced - he might perhaps intrude for brief periods without fear of her detecting his presence. Of course, that would leave him open to the locator. But only introduce some small diversion into the game, and that would take care of that. Men, even talented men, when they are concerned for their own skins, have little time for casting about with their minds. Except that they look for boltholes, of course.Very well then, a diversion. For, in any case, the game was moving far too slowly.From his high vantage point, Malinari looked down on Xanadu and the Pleasure Dome casino (dark in the night but clearly visible in every detail to him) and chose a switch on his array. Down there, his enemies had deployed into first-phase positions. There were men held in reserve, four of them, evenly spaced out at the rear of the leisure area of gardens and pools that surrounded the casino. These four would believe they\u0027d \u0027secured\u0027 or \u0027made safe\u0027 their strategic positions behind low walls just forward of the innermost circle of chalets. Equipped with superior, heat-seeking, image-enhancing weapons, they would consider themselves \u0027ideally situated\u0027 to engage an enemy in flight from the central area.\n And so they would be - if not for the fact that two of the four locations were mined.\n Malinari\u0027s hand lingered over the chosen switch, while his scarlet night-vision eyes swept over, scanned, and committed to memory the second phase of the enemy\u0027s deployment.In the last few minutes a large vehicle - an articulated truck marked with the symbols of a well-known beer manufacturer - had climbed the access road, entered through Xanadu\u0027s gates, turned about, and hissed to a halt in the otherwise empty parking lot. A party of four heavily armed men had issued from the rear of the truck and were hurrying forward into the resort in the direction of the Pleasure Dome.Inwards - at the inner edge of the gardens toward the casino - five NCOs from the helicopter fanned out to surround the huge rotunda of the central dome itself. The men from the truck were now replacing the four in their rearguard positions behind the low walls, which allowed them in their turn to move forward and reinforce the assault force around the dome\u0027s perimeter.Now, or when they were so ordered, three of these Special Forces men would go in through the Pleasure Dome\u0027s main doors; the rest of them, dispersed around the perimeter, would create individual points of entry. The casino\u0027s curving fa\u0026pound;ade of interlocking concrete panels, glass, and reinforced plastic would scarcely suffice to stop them, Malinari was sure. It was, after all, a Pleasure Dome, not a fortress!So much for the fighting men. And Malinari presumed correctly that their commander would be with Trask\u0027s E-Branch party where they were now gathered in a group behind the smaller vehicle on the main esplanade some seventy or eighty feet in front of the steps to the casino\u0027s canopied entranceway. He knew that this was them because of their mental emanations. Hah! Rut they might as well be carrying illuminated signs! They were as Visible\u0027 to him as they must be to the pilot of their flying machine ... as indeed he would be, if he were down in the resort.\n So, they were all set to go, and the onset of hostilities, which must be imminent, might create sufficient of a diversion in itself, allowing Malinari to insinuate himself into the mentalist girl\u0027s mind without alerting the locator to his presence - but he thought not. Much better to be safe than sorry.Let them be the sorry ones.Earlier, before these people got here, Malinari had started a mist. His body and being - even his existence here in this or any world - these things were all contradictions of Nature. He was a poison that worked like a catalyst on and against any natural or mundane surroundings.When he opened the pores of his metamorphic body and willed it, his pores would breathe a mist. Not only that but Nature would be made to respond, to answer his call. And even from the dry earth Malinari could call up a writhing mist like vile, airborne sweat, to disguise his presence. In Sunside it had served a dual purpose: to carry his probes more surely to their target (for the mist was like an extension of himself, or a medium for his mentalism) and also to hide him away should he have reason to make a covert exit - in short, a smokescreen.But this time, so as not to draw attention to himself, he had merely started the thing, set it in motion. And now a fine, milky mist lay on the surface of the pools, and formed a barely visible ground mist in the gardens. But only let Malinari will it, it would spring into being at his command. And in the holocaust to come he would call it up in earnest to carry his mentalism, instil its primal terror, and add to the general confusion.So then, it was time to set the wheels in motion. Time for his diversion. Time to let these fools know who he was.He risked a quick, guarded probe, found one of his thralls inside the open doors to the casino, issued a command and withdrew ... but with no time at all to spare! And even as Malinari felt his probe seized upon - and as he \u0027heard\u0027 Chung\u0027s gasp of startled recognition: \u0027What the ... ?\u0027 - so he tripped the first of his switches ...\n Six or seven minutes earlier:\n Inside the innocuous-looking, in fact armoured estate car,\n Ben Trask, David Chung, lan Goodly, Liz, and the SAS Major were each in their own way concerned. The Major because the articulated ops truck and its back-up party were some minutes late.\n Chopper One had relayed the reason for the delay: the big vehicle\u0027s engine had developed a fault; that and the steepness of the climb had combined to slow her down.\n \u0027The gradient,\u0027 Trask said, \u0027but it could have been any of a hundred and one other logistical problems. Well, we made allowances for this kind of last-minute difficulty. It\u0027s why we\u0027re made up of three contingents: chopper, car, ops truck. Okay, so we\u0027re four men short for the time being. But assuming our estimate of Malinari\u0027s manpower is accurate, we still outnumber him three or four to one. And our firepower is awesome.\u0027And Chung said, \u0027That bothers me a lot: what you just said about our estimate. For the fact is it\u0027s my estimate, so really it\u0027s all down to me.\u0027\u0027No, it isn\u0027t,\u0027 Goodly denied it. \u0027It\u0027s our best estimate, and we\u0027re each of us equally involved in this. Or we should be. And anyway, it\u0027s like I told Ben earlier: at least your talents are working for you.\u0027Trask looked at him. \u0027Still nothing?\u0027\u0027Just confusion/ the precog answered. \u0027And a feeling.\u0027\n \u0027You and me both,\u0027 Trask said, and the others saw that he was actually chewing his top lip. \u0027A feeling, yes ... that this is all wrong. Okay, in a deserted resort we\u0027d expect the lights to be out - why waste the energy? But the silence of the place, this feeling of a pent-up something, and this inactivity ...\u0027\n \u0027Ours, or theirs?\u0027 said Liz.\n Trask shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know - really can\u0027t say - what I was expecting. But it certainly wasn\u0027t this. I mean, he must know we\u0027re here, he has to. So what the hell is he up to? David,\u0027 he turned to the locator, \u0027got any ideas? Is there any movement? What\u0027s going on?\u0027\n Chung\u0027s high brow was etched into deep lines of concentration. It\u0027s weird as hell/ he said. Tm getting these momentary flashes. It is mindsmog, definitely, but from three or four different locations, and I can\u0027t pin them down. Up there in the dome, that\u0027s one of them for sure. But the others ...\u0027 He looked out of his wound-down window at the night-shrouded cliffs where they climbed to the heights behind the resort, and frowned. \u0027Up high, and down below ... that\u0027s as much as I dare venture.\u0027\u0027Up high would be the bubble on top of the Pleasure Dome,\u0027 lan Goodly came in. But Chung only frowned.\u0027Well, possibly,\u0027 he said, \u0027for it\u0027s as strong a source as any. But there are shields in use, I\u0027m sure of that.\u0027 And:\u0027Malinari!\u0027 Trask grunted, grimly. \u0027His aerie. Solar-panelled on the outside, painted black and probably curtained on the inside, for his protection. Well, the murdering bastard will be needing all he can get of that!\u0027\u0027So that\u0027s up high,\u0027 said Liz, \u0027but what about down below? It looks like Jake was right, and according to the plans of the place it\u0027s a real maze down there.\u0027 And turning to Trask, \u0027Ben, I wish you\u0027d let me try to corroborate David\u0027s - \u0027\u0027 - No way!\u0027 Trask snapped, turning on her at once. \u0027That\u0027s right out of the question. No telepathic contact, not with Malinari. Only if it becomes absolutely necessary, maybe I\u0027ll use you then - but not until, and only if I have to. Liz, this is a mentalist who ranks alongside Janos Ferenczy. And it\u0027s one mind you\u0027re not going to enter of your own free will!\u0027Trask and his team were without radio headsets. As espers they needed clear heads, and were better off without the encumbrance of technical equipment. This was a time when the gadgets would only get in the way of the ghosts. And anyway, since they planned on sticking close to the SAS Major throughout the operation, radio contact seemed superfluous to requirement.\n But they did hear the faint crackle of static as suddenly the Major held up a hand. And a moment later: \u0027The big artic is in sight.\u0027 He sighed his relief. \u0027They\u0027ve had a long hard haul, but they\u0027re getting here.\u0027 As he got out of the car he went on, \u0027It\u0027s time we had a little fresh air, but take cover behind the vehicle. We\u0027re in a direct line of fire from the casino.\u0027\u0027Absolutely!\u0027 Chung agreed, choking on the word because of the sudden dryness in his throat. \u0027And up those steps, right in through those doors, that\u0027s another source!\u0027\u0027You\u0027re sure?\u0027 The Major grasped his elbow.\u0027In there,\u0027 Chung began to sweat. \u0027Somebody - something - is waiting!\u0027 And in fact, and despite that it was cool and even chilly now, they were all sweating.Abandoning radio procedure, the Major spoke into his headset. \u0027You men on the doors had better be aware. There\u0027s a reception party waiting for you. Before you go in there, a couple of stun grenades might help clear the way a bit. The rest of you: if you missed it from Hawkeye, here\u0027s a sitrep: the back-up has arrived. The next time you hear from me it will probably be the go-ahead. Stand by for that, over?\u0027\n \u0027Roger that,\u0027 a multitude of terse, tense replies came in, then more static and radio silence ...\n Seconds ticked by, but oh-so-slowly. Then:\n There came the rumbling growl of a straining motor, a hissing of air-brakes, and finally the message that the Major had been waiting for: \u0027Zero, this is the back-up squad. Sorry we\u0027re late. We\u0027re moving into our locations now.\u0027\n The Major turned to Trask, said, \u0027The show\u0027s about to commence. Anything you\u0027d like to say to them?\u0027\u0027Your men?\u0027 Trask shook his head. \u0027Just wish them the best of luck.\u0027 And the Major did it.And Trask thought, Damn it! I don\u0027t even know this bloke\u0027s name! Some of his men, but not him. But that\u0027s how it goes with these people. In their way they\u0027re much like E~Eranch: the less we know about them, the better their security.There was swift, sporadic movement in the night: the shadowy figures of men, keeping low, moving forward, strengthening the assault force surrounding the casino. Using nite-lite binoculars, the Major watched them take up their positions, turned to Trask and said, \u0027Are we ready?\u0027Trask nodded. \u0027Let\u0027s do it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Christ, the longer we wait, the worse it feels!\u0027\u0027Right,\u0027 said the Major. And then, into his headset, \u0027This is Zero to assault group. We\u0027re going in. Attack! Attack! Attack!\u0027 At which all hell broke loose - if not exactly as expected - and it all seemed to happen at once.The locator David Chung gave a massive start. As his eyes opened wide, he pointed at something - some non-specific point high on the face of the cliffs at the rear of the resort - and gripped Trask\u0027s elbow. And as Trask looked at him in astonishment, Chung gasped, What the ... ?\u0027At the same time:Fifty or so feet behind the group where they sheltered on the \u0027safe\u0027 side of the armoured car, a ball of brilliant light lit the night; following hot on its heels, there came the deafening roar of an explosion, and the death cry of a soldier.The savagery of the blast was such that it hurled them all against the side of the car and rocked the vehicle on its shock absorbers. All eyes blinked, and hands were thrown up to shield startled faces. Then, as debris began to rain down, they looked back. The SAS man was in mid-air, a human Catherine wheel spinning there - torn almost in half, black and burning - and quite obviously dead.Bricks from the low wall where the NCO had taken cover - which had at least sheltered Trask and his group from the worst of the blast - were showering down; a jagged half-brick struck Chung on the forehead, threw him a second time against the side of the car. He slid to the ground in a hail of lesser debris.\n \u0027Jesus Christ!\u0027 the Major straightened up, went to stagger toward the spot where his man\u0027s body lay in a crumpled, smoking heap. Trask stopped him, croaked:\n \u0027You saw what I saw. You can\u0027t help him now.\u0027\u0027But what the hell ... ?\u0027 The Major asked helplessly, of no one in particular. \u0027A mortar, a grenade - an accident? Jesus, it must have been a fucking accident!\u0027And meanwhile, the night had come deafeningly alive.From the casino, a withering stream of automatic fire sent bullets ricochetting off the far side of the car, and from somewhere in the night a soldier shouted, \u0027I\u0027m hit! God - I\u0027m hit!\u0027 It hardly sounded like the cry of a man, but more like that of a small, bewildered child.Then the casino\u0027s entrance was lit by twin balls of brilliant white light - the blinding flashes and shattering reports of stun grenades - and figures were glimpsed briefly, silhouetted in the swift-dying glare.There were explosions from all around the Pleasure Dome as two-man units hurled grenades to breach the outer wall and gain entry, and covering fire as men went in through smoking holes.\u0027We have to go in, too,\u0027 said the Major. \u0027We need to know what\u0027s going on. But first let\u0027s see to your man.\u0027They laid Chung on the rear seat of the car. Mumbling to himself, the locator was already regaining consciousness. The Major gave Liz a field dressing, said, \u0027Staunch the blood. He looks okay, but stay with him. Where\u0027s your gun?\u0027Liz took out her Baby Browning, cocked it and laid it on the rear windowsill of the car within easy reach.Trask leaned inside the car to touch her shoulder. \u0027You\u0027d better do as he says,\u0027 he said. \u0027And when we\u0027re gone, lock the doors.\u0027 For the moment shaken, disoriented, and concerned for Chung, Liz did as she was told. Through the window, she watched the Major, Trask, and Goodly move off towards the casino.\n In a little while Chung opened his eyes, looked up at Liz and said, \u0027He\u0027s up there ... up high ... Malinari!\u0027 He managed to lift himself up a little as she applied the field dressing. He was looking at (or perhaps looking beyond?) the casino. The way he rolled his not-quite-focussed eyes, it was hard to tell.\u0027The bubble on top of the dome?\u0027 Liz answered, and nodded an affirmative. \u0027We know. They\u0027re going in after him now.\u0027No!\u0027 The locator tried to shake his head. \u0027Not the Pleasure Dome, but up there! Up ... up there ...\u0027\u0027Up there?\u0027 Liz had the dressing in place now. Tying off the bandage, she looked where Chung pointed a shaky hand. \u0027The mountain?\u0027\u0027The cliffs,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027He\u0027s ... he\u0027s in the cliffs!\u0027After that it was all instinct, and almost instantaneous. Liz didn\u0027t think twice but sent out her telepathic thoughts to follow Chung\u0027s line of sight, to be guided like a laser-assisted missile to his target. Except that in this case the target was far more dangerous than the missile. And:Ahhhhhhlsaid a voice in Liz\u0027s mind - a voice like steam escaping from a kettle, or the hiss of a volcanic vent - It\u0027s the sweet little telepath herself! And Liz could actually feel the patterns of her mind being scrutinized, fingerprinted, and memorized. She erected shields and felt the hideous, slug-like presence of Malinari withdrawing, dwindling, gone! Then:\u0027My God!\u0027 She exploded into frantic activity, grabbed her gun, scrambled backwards out of the car. \u0027I have to tell Ben!\u0027 But then, pausing to lean back inside: \u0027David, I - \u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s okay.\u0027 Chung was really coming out of it now, beginning to make good sense. \u0027Go find them, Liz, and tell them Malinari\u0027s in those cliffs. If they call the chopper down, and get the pilot to use thermal imaging, he\u0027ll spot the bastard easily enough.\u0027 He managed to sit up, however groggily.\n \u0027Lock the doors when I\u0027ve gone,\u0027 she told him. And, crouching down low, she ran for the casino ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-33.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
