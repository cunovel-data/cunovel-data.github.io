{"id":97223,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Nathan\u0027s WarIn the sump of the once-refuge (and yet not really there, for in fact Jake Cutter was asleep and uneasily dreaming in a jetcopter speeding east towards Brisbane across the vastly sprawling Simpson Desert) Harry Keogh\u0027s deadspeak voice once again startled Jake from the weird reverie induced by Korath MindsthralTs story: You\u0027ve done well, Korath, and we are almost finished now, Harry said. Almost? The vampire answered gloomily, by now perhaps resignedly. What more can you possibly want of me?Well, we know what you failed to find when you returned to Starside, the ex-Necroscope, or rather his revenant - or, better still, this facet of him - answered. You didn\u0027t find Shaitan or any others of the Wamphyri, and you certainly didn\u0027t find their aeries! Instead you found the hollow stumps of those once-great stacks, which you, your master, and Us colleagues were obliged to use as temporary dwelling places. Then, once again, you commenced raiding on Sunside\u0027s Szgany. You can take it from there.But it scarcely seems worthwhile, Korath protested. For it appears you already know it all!\\n\\n Not all of it. (The shake of an incorporeal head.) How didMalinari and the others fair on Sunside,for instance? We would like to know how the Szgany ... welcomed them? Also, we want to know what made those three Great Vampires desert Starside, risk their necks by venturing into the ill-omened subterranean Gate, and come here. And since you were involved, who better to ask?\\n\\n Very well, Korath grated, his patience all but used up. If it would please you -\\n\\n - It would, Harry told him. And it would serve to keep us here a while longer at least.Then, with a sigh, Korath put the finishing touches to his tale:\u0027We flew home, to what had been our home. You are correct: the aeries were gone, like vast stone corpses fallen on the barren boulder plains. And arriving in the hour before sunup, we were obliged to find shelter in their shattered stumps.\u0027The desmodus colonies were still there, and we found ourselves greeted by descendants of the descendants of our former familiars. At least they were the same! And like the bats themselves, we sheltered from the sun (which seemed to rise marginally higher in the sky) in their lowly crumbling caverns in the echoing basement levels of the shattered stacks.\u0027Night came, and with it the fear that perhaps the Szgany were no more: that they, too, might have succumbed to whatever disaster had befallen here. But when we flew to the higher ridges of the barrier mountains and looked down on Sunside - \u0027 - Ah! But the Szgany were there, and in such numbers!\u0027Their campfires - and in many cases more permanent town or settlement fires - lit the night like so many glow-worms in the dark of forests which, in our time, had not seen so much as a night-light, but only the tell-tale smoke of cottage or caravan stoves! And here they were all joyous, juicy, and fearless, our beloved Szgany of Sunside. The sounds of their music drifted up to our keen vampire ears, and the smells of their cooking - and of them - to our wide, straining nostrils. Ah, that was a beautiful moment!\u0027And Malinari said: \"The Wamphyri are gone. We three alone of all the Great Vampires survive.\" (He excluded me, of course.) Do you see, Vavara? We are survivors, the only survivors! And so I was right.\"\u0027 \"And now we go down,\" whispered Szwart, \"to the feast!\"\u0027But: \"Ah, no, not so,\" said The Mind, holding up a cautionary hand. \"Those tribes down there, they do not know we are back. If we raid here, now, then they will know. And next time will be that much harder. But we have aeries to build and furnish, lieutenants and thralls to recruit, warrior creatures and flyers to breed in our vats - hah! When we have first discovered or dug vats, in the wreckage of those shattered stumps!\u0027 \"Also, you must ask yourself what happened here. Did the Wamphyri destroy themselves or were they destroyed? And if the latter, by whom? The Szgany? Ah, no, Lord Szwart, having survived the Icelands, I am in no great hurry to show myself here. For my thoughts have gone out and found an odd sense of security and freedom in the Szgany. Why, they are unafraid! Perhaps because they no longer have reason to be afraid. Which in turn might mean that we do. Wherefore we must be cautious and first discover the secret of these changes in the scheme of things.\"\u0027 \"So what would you suggest?\" Szwart hissed. \"That we sit here all night and admire their fires?\"\u0027Malinari shook his head. \"Those tribes down there, close-packed in this central area of Sunside. If we raid on one, then by morning all of them will know. And we need time to re-establish ourselves. So this is what we will do. Tonight we split up. Vavara raids in the far west, you in the east, but this side of the great pass. I shall raid beyond the pass. And we glut, aye, but mainly we recruit - we recruitfuriously, taking as many as we can. We share our spoils equally, building together, allies by circumstance as we have always been. This way, gradually, we shall discover what\u0027s what here: how things stand, and why they seem so different now. Is it agreed?\"\\n\\n \u0027After some small haggling it was so agreed, and as Malinari had decreed we recruited \"furiously\". We converted men into thralls, from whose ranks we chose lieutenants; these were soon able to make more thralls - and so on. And we stockpiled drink and foodstuffs (aye, and other good stuff) out of Sunside, and put a task force to work digging in the rubble-strewn stumps of the old fallen stacks, building walls around our chosen habitations and roofing them over.\\n\\n \u0027During all of this construction, occasionally our workers would uncover vats, gas-beast chambers, or cocooned matter from yesteryear. Of course, the greater mass of the once-living material was putrid, no longer usable; some of it, however, contained a spark and was digestible, assimilable by newer, fresher material out of Sunside. And so we progressed.\\n\\n \u0027But time passed, and word of our presence also passed - from tribe to tribe and clan to clan - until all the peoples of Sunside knew that the Wamphyri were back in Starside. It didn\u0027t take long, say ten or twelve sundowns.\u0027Meanwhile we had recruited some eight hundred men, women, and children. Moreover, deep beneath the foundations of a toppled aerie, our workers had discovered a cache of well-preserved metamorphic liquids requiring little more than imprinting - an infusion of essence and a few nodes of rudimentary intelligence - to stimulate growth. And now we could fill the vats with vampiric life.\u0027First we made flyers, successfully! And later we tried for warriors, but that was when the trouble started. It was a tribe known for its aggressive nature in the olden times, and no less ferocious now: the Szgany Lidesci, whose territory lay midwest of Sunside in fertile forests under cavern-riddled foothills.\u0027Apparently the Lidescis had found a hero, a youth or man called Nathan Kiklu, who had ventured into forbidden places and returned with awesome weapons. It was a story we heard over and over again from thralls recruited in Sunside: how this Nathan\u0027s brother had been Wamphyri - Lord Nestor, of an aerie so mighty it could only have been Dramstack, or whatever it was called in his time - and how he had contrived to hurl his Szgany sibling into the Hell-Lands Gate.\u0027Well, the Gate was a legend; in our time it had been used as a punishment, and no man or creature who entered, \"banished\" into the white glare of the Starside Gate, had ever returned to tell of his adventures. But that was then and this was now, and for a certainty this Nathan was extant; all too soon, we would begin to experience his works at first hand.\u0027He was of the Szgany Lidesci. No longer nomadic, the Lidescis had built a sprawling town or fortification called Settlement. And the first time we raided on them - which was also the last time - ah, but then we discovered the meaning of \"awesome weapons!\"\u0027Our warriors - which were far more complicated constructs than flyers - were not waxed as yet. We went in with a force of flyers and thrall riders, and a handful of lieutenants to guide the men into battle. Except it wasn\u0027t planned as a battle but a rout, when the Szgany would flee and we would pick off the hindmost. Vavara and Malinari between them made a mist (Szwart was above such devices when he could avoid them; since he could simply merge into the night, he deemed mists unsporting and indeed unnecessary deceptions). But be that is it may, the mist rolled down out of the foothills to swallow Settlement whole. We could see the fitful glow of the Lidescis\u0027 communal fires deep in its clammy heart.\u0027Then our flyers launched and settled towards the town ... and flew straight into the teeth of hell!\u0027Fortunately, we leaders were not in the forefront of this offensive; instead, alerted by my master who was suspicious, we had held back to observe the initial Lidesci reaction. For when Malinari had sent his telepathic probes deep into the mist over Settlement, he had sensed something strange - a mental silence, an awareness, a threat. And he was right.\\n\\n \u0027The night came alive with deafening explosions, brilliant flashes of light and shrill screams - not Szgany screams! These were the shrieks of our thralls, and the hissing death-cries of stricken flyers. And echoing up to us from Settlement\u0027s wooden walls came sharp, spitting cracks of sound one after the other, like stones breaking in a fire or saplings snapping in an avalanche. And great, dazzling balls of fire came soaring up out of the mist into a body of flyers that was still descending. Wherever they hit, destruction followed: flyers bursting into flame and blazing thralls leaping from their saddles!\\n\\n \u0027And finally more aerial fireballs: this time aimed at us, where we looked on in utter disbelief from our \"safe\" foothills ridge. Then:\\n\\n \u0027\"Enough!\" And uttering a curse, Szwart spurred his mount aloft and climbed into the night. A true fly-the-light, he had seen and suffered all he could bear; now he retreated from the blinding flares of man-made fireballs.\u0027Malinari and Vavara, they used Wamphyri mentalism to call off what handfuls remained of our forces, many of whom were too badly damaged to make it back across the barrier mountains into Starside. And as that sorry, scorched and blistered rabble came limping through the mist - glad to escape from the roil and the reek - so we launched and rose on sulphur thermals, and headed for home ...\u0027... And for the surprise of our lives!\u0027As we fell towards the triangle of rubble wherein we had commenced to build our new empire, we saw what could not be - such devastation! Our central gas-beast chambers, blown asunder, and their occupants in tatters all strewn about, exploded in the blast of their own gases! And warrior vats ablaze with liquid fire that burned blue to melt the mewling monsters! And even as we circled overhead in stunned amaze, a thunderous explosion that tossed shattered vampire thralls and debris aloft over the battlement walls of one of Malinari\u0027s unfinished constructions (a warrior pen, which never would be finished now), bursting the walls themselves outwards with its force!\u0027We landed hurriedly, in unaccustomed disarray, and without ceremony my master and his colleagues hurled themselves in their fury upon those thralls who had been left behind to mind our works. But before a single question could be fired, a single thrall executed:\u0027 \"Ho, there!\" A strange voice from on high - but not the harsh tones, warning growl or threatening hiss of the Wamphyri. No, this was the voice of a young man, and entirely human.\u0027He stood on the ledge of a shattered stump, his back to the sheer rock wall. There was no way up from his position and none down, not without he encounter the Wamphyri or their lieutenants and thralls. And he was tall but slight, with nothing of the bulk of a vampire or the leaden look of a Lord. He was, quite literally, a man - Szgany.\u0027\"Who are you?\" said Malinari. \"This Nathan, perhaps? And is this your work? If so you are a dead man!\" I felt my master concentrating, the waves of animosity beating out from him, to enter the stranger\u0027s mind and befuddle it.\u0027But young as he was, and obviously mad (or perhaps not?) he only smiled a knowing smile, shook his head, and said, \"Ah, no, my mentalist friend - my mind is shielded. And if Maglore the Mage could not get to me, what chance have you? And you\u0027re right: I am Nathan, and this is my work. Nor have you seen the last of it.\"\u0027Malinari gestured (with his mind); thralls crept towards the broken stairway that led to Nathan\u0027s position. He glanced at them, saw them coming, appeared to ignore them.\u0027 Meanwhile, the voluptuous Vavara had stepped forward. She was almost physically aglow and issued her ultimate aura of feminine allure. Her mouth blew a kiss and a promise in Nathan\u0027s direction; she smiled up at him on his ledge - the knowing smile of a whore, yet one to cut into a man\u0027s soul, if he had one - and lit the night with the lustful heat of her jewel-green, crimson-cored eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Tipping back her hood and opening her collar, she shook out her raven hair, then let her long, bat-fur cloak fall open. Her blouse was a simple band of cloth crossing from shoulder to waist, cupping one breast and leaving the other bare. Her flesh was marble in moon and starlight, and that proud, naked, stiff-tipped breast shone with the oils she used. She twirled to send her skirt of ropes flying, then came to an abrupt halt. Tantalizing she stood, with her cloak poised on the air and the ropes of her skirt outflung.\\n\\n Her sturdy legs were spread wide, thighs like pillars, buttocks as round as an apple, dark-tufted in its dimple where the stem has been plucked and a leaf or two remain. And I stood there drooling my lust, for I had grown just such a stem as might replace it! Then Vavara\u0027s cloak floated back into position and she was covered. But the picture stayed printed on every eye.\\n\\n \u0027I felt my blood pounding; I might myself have rushed upon her - to my doom - but Malinari\u0027s hand was on my shoulder; he held me back. And this tall, pale Szgany whelp, this Nathan, he looked down on the priestess of lust, looked down on Vavara... and curled his lip!\u0027Vavara was astonished; she felt her aura repelled as this mere man scorned her, saying, \"As for you: you should know that I have been tempted by real Ladies! My mind is closed to you no less than to the mentalist there. And by the way, I know all of you. You: Vavara, Malinari, and Szwart. You were legends and now you are reality, come back from the Icelands. But if I were you I would return there, and now. There\u0027s nothing for you here but the true death. And like my father before me, who brought down these evil stacks to shatter into pieces on the boulder plains, so shall I bring you down. That is my vow, as a man of the Szgany Lidesci.\"\u0027Through all of this, Szwart had melted himself to a dark shadow on the strewn rubble. Now, flowing like a black and sentient lichen - a living stain - he moved towards the crumbling stairway. By now, too, Malinari\u0027s thralls had climbed halfway up, which was as far as they would ever get.\u0027 \"And you, Szwart,\" said the youth from on high, perhaps fifty feet up the stony skeleton of that ancient stairway. \"Do you think to sweep over and devour me? As the legend goes, you are akin to the night and can disappear into it. But you and I know that men - and monsters - cannot simply disappear. It\u0027s true, Szwart, isn\u0027t it?\" While he spoke he took something from his Szgany jerkin, twisted it in his hands, lobbed it down, to bounce from step to step. And he said, \"Well, perhaps it\u0027s true for you, at least. But as for me: I must be on my way. You may not see me, but you\u0027ll definitely be hearing from me.\" So saying, he stepped back into the shadows where the wall angled.\u0027Lord Szwart flowed over the top of the wall where Nathan had stood, and onto the ledge from which he\u0027d taunted all three of the Wamphyri. Szwart\u0027s darkness gathered there, shifting and seething, then rolled on into the selfsame shadows that hid the madman from view. And I knew that it was the end for Nathan Kiklu, whoever he had been. Lord Szwart\u0027s protoplasm would envelop him; its strange, metamorphic acids would work on him; he would shrink, devolve, and dissolve to become one with night\u0027s master. Or rather, his liquefied flesh would add to Szwart\u0027s bulk for a while, until it was converted into fuel.\u0027The egg-shaped item that Nathan had thrown bounced again, into the group of three climbing thralls. And there it exploded in a flash of light as bright and momentarily brighter than the sun itself! Light, heat, and a blast of alien energy that lacerated the flesh of the unfortunate thralls and blew them off the stone stairway, down into the rubble. They were in pieces, dead before they hit bottom. And Szwart hissing and shrieking, reeling on the high stairs where he tried to regain his man-shape, failed, and collapsed again to a slithering stain.\u0027All of this shocking, aye, but none so much as what Lord Szwart called out to us as finally he reformed, shaping himself into an airfoil and launching in search of some night-dark place in which to regain his composure:\u0027\"He was not there!\" he shrilled. \"He is not here! No man, that one, but a ghost! Perhaps the spirit of all the Szgany we ever took in our lives, all combined in one vengeful ghost!\"\\n\\n \u0027And Malinari turned to Vavara and said, \"Szwart is right. Not that Nathan is a ghost, but that he\u0027s no longer here. For a moment I touched his mind - real in the field of my probes, as real as the shields he raised against me - and in the next moment, gone! So if you think we have seen awesome weapons at work this night, well, now we have seen a real weapon: the man Nathan himself.\\n\\n But all of this bears thinking about, and I shall give it my gravest consideration.\"\u0027And despite that The Mind had chosen his words carefully, perhaps because he felt he must retain at least a measure of control, still his sprouting scythe teeth were awash in his own blood where he ground them deep into his lips and riven gums ...\u0027And Malinari did give it his gravest consideration, as did we all; but no amount of thinking could compensate for our losses, or dream up a successful defence against future depredations by the demon Nathan. Thus that entire night was a disaster, and no guarantee that things were ever going to get any better.\u0027We went subterranean. Unthinkable, eh - that the Wamphyri should ever flee from a man? From the sun, aye, but not from a single man! - yet such was the case. If we could not build on high, then we must build below, where the stumps of the toppled stacks were riddled with tunnels, caverns, and places which, in the olden times, were only ever fit for bats and beetles.\u0027And despite that our work force was reduced - our flyers, too, and our warriors boiled in their vats - still we had several hundreds of thralls and provisions aplenty.\u0027The thralls were put to work; they cleared the debris from ancient diggings, moved our provisions to safety, and built defensive positions on the surface. New vats of metamorphosis were discovered or dug, into which we sacrificed a third of our manpower, the raw materials of our future flyers and warriors. And we commenced keeping a watch ... can you believe it? The Wamphyri, vigilant against any further sabotage attempts by this mere man! Moreover, it was more rigidly enforced than any watch that our vanished ancestors had ever kept against each other.\u0027But this last was a necessity, for from then on, whenever we raided against the Szgany, we could be sure that retaliation would follow hot on our heels. And Nathan Kiklu - man or ghost or whatever he was - he was everywhere. If we raided in the far western reaches of Sunside, he would soon be there with a party of Lidesci fighters, with \"guns,\" \"grenades\" and \"rockets\", setting fire to the wings of our flyers, blinding them with silver shot, and knocking our thralls out of their saddles before they could even touch down! Thus, for every man we recruited in Sunside, one of ours was killed by Nathan and his Szgany soldiers. And every forward step was followed by one to the rear.\u0027East, west, wherever we struck, Nathan and his men could be there in a trice. How? It was beyond us. Moreover, lie would snipe on us from afar, and shoot our thralls dead in their defensive or watchtower positions. Until my master and his colleagues were obliged to devise a new strategy.\u0027Instead of inhabiting just one central area of Starside\u0027s olden ruins, now we spread out and stationed men in every shattered stump and heap of rubble. For one thing was certain: whoever or whatever Nathan was, and for all that he could appear almost magically, anywhere, in extremely short order, he couldn\u0027t possibly be everywhere at once.\u0027 And so we maintained something of our equilibrium, despite that we made little progress ...\u0027One night my master flew out alone. Returning shortly, he complained bitterly that: \"This damned Szgany bastard - he has spies in the barrier mountains! Hah! That is how he knows where we will raid: they watch us fly up from the boulder plains, the direction we take, then make report to him. I tracked them with my mentalism - which is how I discovered theirs!\"\u0027 \"What? They are thought-thieves, these men?\" Vavara found it hard to believe. \"Mentalists?\"\u0027Malinari laughed like a madman, and answered, \"Even as we are mentalists, aye. So says Malinari the Mind, the greatest of them all. But... they are not men!\"\u0027 \"Not men?\" And now Szwart was baffled. \"Not men, you say? Then what - trogs?\"\\n\\n \u0027Malinari gave a wild shake of his head and waved his arms in consternation. \"Not trogs, no - but dogs!\"ht said. \"Wolves of the wild that think like men. Stranger still, they call this Nathan uncle! He is their kin!\"\\n\\n \u0027 \"Then he is a dog-Lord!\" said Vavara. \"It\u0027s the only possible solution. This hated enemy of ours is Wamphyri! He dwells in the mountain heights, rules on Sunside, and keeps the Szgany for himself. His needs are so slight that the tribes suffer him for his protection. I must be right. Nathan is a changeling.\"\\n\\n \u0027And Szwart said, \"But a dog-Lord? With powers such as he commands? And as for suffering him for his protection - against what? What was there before we came?\"\u0027My master threw up his hands, crying, \"I don\u0027t know! I no longer know anything ... except that I am sick to death of this Nathan, of this ruined place, and of all this endless work performed without reward. This work that gets us nowhere ...\"\u0027We took to raiding separately but simultaneously in locations far apart, and we covered our movements with great stealth. For again the principle applied: that Nathan couldn\u0027t be everywhere at once. And at last a small measure of success - which didn\u0027t last long. He couldn\u0027t be everywhere, but his weapons could.\u0027From thralls freshly converted we learned how he had disseminated his destructive devices - his guns and grenades, and so forth - among as many of the tribes as possible. And he had taught them how to use them. But these weapons and the \"ammunition\" they used were not in unlimited supply. From time to time Nathan must replenish them by venturing into the Hell-lands.\u0027That in itself posed a question: how was it possible for Nathan to make these trips to the Hell-lands without using the Starside Gate? For the Gate was no longer accessible. Where in our time it had rested in the bottom of a crater in the lee of the foothills not far from the great pass, now it was raised up and stood in the centre of a lake! And that lake of white water had many small whirlpools to suck a swimmer down.\u0027Often in our forays across the barrier mountains into Sunside we had seen it there: that fountain of water, all lit from within, rising up high into the night and falling back into the lake.\u0027In order to solve that problem, we flew out one night; or rather,\\n\\n Malinari and Vavara flew out, and a few lieutenants and thralls in attendance. For Lord Szwart would not consider going anywhere near such a brilliant source of light, despite that it was cold.\u0027Ah, but that was indeed a fortunate trip - for the Wamphyri at least, if not (as it later turned out) for me; though of course I could not know that then. Anyway, during the long day previous, while we vampires slept or carried out our subterranean duties beneath the stumps of the old stacks, apparently the lake had run dry!\u0027And there stood the Gate, raised up in its crater socket, like the blind white eye of some fallen Cyclops shining up into the night. But as for the lake and its fountain of milky water: they were no more, not even a trickle.\u0027 The earth was dry, caked, and wrinkled into channels that showed how the water had disappeared down circular boreholes that angled into the bedrock like conduits to hell. A weird thing, this Gate; weird as the tumbling moon or ice-chip stars, and just as inexplicable.\u0027Malinari, Vavara and their men had left their flyers in the shadowy foothills between the Gate and the great pass, well away from the Gate itself. Facing downhill on a moderate slope, the flyers were positioned for immediate flight. It was a safety measure, to ensure a quick getaway should such become necessary. And so it may be seen that even among the Great Vampires the Hell-lands Gate was held in no small measure of respect.\u0027And separating into small, wide-spread groups, we applied the same caution to our method of approach - moving from boulder clump to boulder clump, and always sticking to the shadows - as we drew closer to the Gate. But we were still some distance away when suddenly my master threw up a warning hand, and issued a mental alarm that reached out to all of us:\u0027\"Something is coming through the Gate!\" his voice hissed in our minds, as we melted back into darkest shadows.\\n\\n \u0027And he was correct, of course. He had sensed their alien minds, these men of the Hell-lands (of your world, that is), as they stepped forth onto the surface of our world. Far more importantly, however, Malinari had sensed their unpreparedness. Oh, they had weapons as devastating as Nathan\u0027s, but for protection as opposed to open aggression. Also, they had little or no idea what to expect in Starside, and to a man their minds were pre-occupied with greed for the heavy, malleable yellow metal that you call gold, which in my world is common.\u0027They were thirty-two in number, half of them being soldiers who took up positions on the flanks as the rest formed into an unruly, excited, and chattering body. Then they marched for the great pass. Two of the soldiers rode noisy, wheeled engines that cut the darkness with beams of cold white light; they went ahead to pick a route through the many boulders that litter the area. Keeping still and silent in the shadows, we let them pass right through the various groups of our divided party.\\n\\n \u0027Then it was that Malinari apprised us, \"These men are not like Nathan. They are like infants, with little or no knowledge of what they are about! Those on the outside - the soldiers - they have weapons. When we strike, we take them out first. Kill them with dispatch. They barely outnumber us and shouldn\u0027t be a problem; this time the advantage of surprise is on our side. As for the central body: these are the minds behind the muscle ... puny things by my reckoning, and not a mentalist among them. So be it; they are weaklings and we must take them alive for questioning. Now make ready - in the next few seconds your destiny may change beyond all recognition!\"\\n\\n \u0027Which of course it did.\u0027I cannot describe what next took place as \"a battle\", nor even a rout, for none of our victims had time to flee! Surprise was indeed on our side, and add to this our flowing, lightning-strike speed, and our vampire strength, equal in each of us to that of four or five strong men ... the result was overwhelming. Hell-landers they were, but they had never seen hell such as we delivered that night.\u0027There was some gunfire, soon silenced. We lost a lieutenant and three thralls. The Hell-landers lost everything - their so-called \"fighting men\", anyway. As for the two on their \"motorcycles\", when they returned to see what was the trouble, and having seen it didn\u0027t stop but headed out onto the barren boulder plains: We picked them off later.\\n\\n \u0027The freshly dead were carried back to fuel our vats, the living were taken for questioning by Malinari. I can\u0027t honestly say which group was least fortunate, the living or the dead ... the living, I suspect. In the long run it would make no difference; the one group would join the other.\\n\\n \u0027What my master learned, however - ah, but that made a big difference! Sufficient to excite Malinari and his Wamphyri colleagues beyond measure. And for me, it was the beginning of the end .. .\u0027Korath had fallen silent for a while. When next he spoke it was similar to a sigh in Jake Cutter\u0027s sleeping mind, and deadspeak in the metaphysical Harry Keogh\u0027s:The rest you know. In a while, when Malinari had extracted and assimilated all he could of knowledge from the minds of the \"scientists\" and their military leader, it was time to take our leave ofStarside.\\n\\n Before doing so, The Mind, Vavara, and Szwart made a great many lieutenants; they took them down into undeath, and brought them up again as burgeoning Wamphyri! And they divided between them all the remaining thralls, flyers and waxing warriors, and all territorial holdings, provisions, and so forth. It was done for spite, out of malice; if the three Great Vampires could not have Sunside/Starsidefor their own, then neither could Nathan and the Lidescis, nor the Szgany as a people - not without they Jightfor it for long and long, and pay for it in blood. And so you may be sure that even now there are new Lords in Starside, while in Sunside the bloodJlows as of yore ...\\n\\n Finally Korath was done, and Harry said, From all you have told us, your lot was not a happy one. And your end was unfair, to say the least. I am glad you finally agree! said the dead vampire. But: - From what you have told us, at least, said Harry. But I am more concerned with what you haven\u0027t toM us, which is probably more important than all the rest put together. The Wamphyri have been here in our world for some time, but it would seem they\u0027ve achieved very little. What are they up to, Korath? What is their plan? You were one of theirs, and so you must know.\\n\\n Ahhhh! said the other slyly, in a tone that suggested the shake of an incorporeal head. And so to the crux of the matter. But no, what you ask is for me to know and for you to discover, or to guess at for a long, long time, until it is too late. For after all, it is my only remaining bargaining point - the last trick up a poor dead thing\u0027s sleeve. And when you have that, I shall have nothing at all\u0027Bargaining point?\u0027 said Jake, just a little surprised by his own voice, after keeping so long silent. \u0027But you\u0027re a dead thing! What can you possibly bargain for - what can we give you - apart from a little companionship, a little cold comfort?\u0027Well, that might be a start...But the ex-Necroscope intervened and said: You have already had that, companionship and cold comfort, and probably too much of both. It isn\u0027t a healthy thing to spend too much time in the company of vampires. No, there\u0027s no bargain you can strike here, Korath Mindsthrall. Also, I sense that your will is strong. You are dead, but your tenacity is very much alive! Jake, it\u0027s time we were having.\u0027I thought you\u0027d never get to it,\u0027 Jake answered./ only hope you remember some of this, said Harry.Tm still not a hundred per cent sure I want to,\u0027 Jake vacillated.Well, get sure! said Harry, his fading deadspeak voice frustrated and angry. Your entire world depends upon it. And if you can\u0027t remember anything else, do try to remember this:An incredible wall of numbers - like a computer screen run riot - evolved in the eye of Jake\u0027s mind, its symbols and equations marching and mutating until they reached a certain critical point... and formed a door. A Mobius door! And Jake knew without knowing how that all that remained of Harry was passing through it, moving on to another place, perhaps another time.\u0027I ... I\u0027m supposed to remember that?\u0027 he said, as the door collapsed and left him on his own in the dank and gurgling sump of the once-Refuge. On his own, but not quite alone. For:\\n\\n Do not concern yourself, Jake Cutter, Korath MmdsthraU\u0027s leering deadspeak voice came to him out of the sudden inky darkness that enveloped him and the sump and everything, a darkness that was prelude to the light of the waking world. No, for I am sure that we\u0027ll be able to work something out -\\n\\n - Er, between us?Jake made no reply, or if he did it was left behind as he went spiralling up and up to the waiting light... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-24.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \\n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \\n Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \\n If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \\n But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire.
