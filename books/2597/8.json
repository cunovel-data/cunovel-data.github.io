{"id":97207,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"More Gadgets And GhostsAs Liz and Jake got out of their vehicle, Trask came over and checked it for damage: a few scratches to the paintwork, some small dents in the hood, and the missing windscreen, of course. \u0027Did you have this attended to?\u0027Liz knew what he was concerned about: not the damage itself but rather its origin, and any possible contamination that might have been left behind. She nodded. \u0027Back at the Old Mine gas station. A squad sprayed her down, cleaned up the mess.\u0027\u0027I worry, that\u0027s all,\u0027 Trask explained. \u0027But having seen some of the measures the Travellers take on Sunside, I suppose that\u0027s only natural.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027I don\u0027t know... maybe I\u0027m too cautious.\u0027 His reference to Sunside flew over Jake\u0027s head, but he was getting used to that kind of thing.\u0027I didn\u0027t see you taking too much care of yourself,\u0027 Jake told him. \u0027Back there, I mean. You and the old man, Lardis? It was as if you didn\u0027t give a damn between you.\u0027 No nose-plugs or combat gear. No gas masks. No precautions.\u0027Trask looked at him. \u0027A paradox? Is that what you\u0027re saying? Do as I say, not as I do? Not really. Maybe one day I\u0027ll tell you my story. But couldn\u0027t it simply be that some of us have less to lose?\u0027 And before he could be asked to elaborate:\n \u0027As for Lardis Lidesci, he\u0027s been doing his own thing all his life. Perhaps there\u0027s a partial immunity among the Szgany, I can\u0027t say. But even so I watch him, just as he keeps his eye on everyone else. And the day he gets rid of his silver bells, or starts shrinking from the sun ...\u0027 Trask let it go at that.\u0027Maybe I haven\u0027t been listening very much,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027In fact I\u0027m sure I haven\u0027t. There\u0027s been too much happening - not only to me but all around me - for my tiny brain to accept it all at once. But what if I start listening as of now? Am I asking too much that we sit down some time so you can fill me in, put me fully in the picture about E-Branch? I mean, if I\u0027m to work for you, isn\u0027t it only right I should know something of what\u0027s going on?\u0027\u0027So you\u0027ve finally decided you\u0027ll work for us?\u0027Jake pulled a wry face. \u0027Actually, I thought you had!\u0027 And the three of them walked together towards one of the campfires.The rest of the vehicles were arriving and lining up on the road before being allocated parking areas. Making himself heard over the revving motors, Trask shouted a few instructions, then answered Jake. \u0027Oh, I think there\u0027s work for you. But there are still a few things I need to clear up. If I\u0027m to control you, I need to know what I\u0027m controlling.\u0027 He looked at the other, his gaze seeming to pierce the younger man through and through, and with a wry smile continued, Tve got to be sure you won\u0027t just cut and run - like maybe in a crisis, when you\u0027re most needed. After all, you do still have your own agenda.\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t you ever trust anybody?\u0027 Jake growled, knowing that indeed Trask had seen right through him.But, enigmatic as ever, Trask wasn\u0027t buying it. \u0027In my time with the Branch,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what trust can do ... and what it\u0027s done to some of my favourite people.\u0027They sat by the fire with one or two other agents, most of them keeping to themselves, lost in their own thoughts now that the night\u0027s work was done. It was a night they\u0027d been building up to for some time. The Old Lidesci dished out food - steaks, and steaming stew from a container on a military shallow-trench back-burner, and man-sized chunks of bread fresh from the burner\u0027s oven - but with the exception of Lardis himself no one was much interested in eating. Maybe it was the back-burner\u0027s roar, the way it sounded so much like a flame-thrower ...By the time the three had done eating, and washed the food down with mugs of coffee, the big articulated truck was in situ and lan Goodly had gone to check on incoming messages. By then, too, the rest of the agents had sat down to eat, and the atmosphere wasn\u0027t quite so heavy.Liz had been yawning for some time, and though she swore she would never sleep, still she\u0027d gone off to seek out a bivouac for herself. Watching her go, Jake put down his empty mug and said to Trask, \u0027Me, I\u0027m not tired either. In fact my mind is going every which way. So, all misgivings aside, I\u0027m asking you to tell me what I\u0027ve got myself involved with, how it all began, and how you think I can fit in.\u0027Trask stood up and for a moment looked as if he might say something. But just then lan Goodly came striding from the direction of the Ops vehicle. On top of the first trailer, in fact the mobile Ops Room, a cluster of antennae and radio dishes had poked up, locked into position, and aimed themselves at the sky... also at several communication satellites.\u0027Ben/ Goodly called in his piping voice. \u0027David Chung is on the wire from London. You can get him on-screen if you want. He got your message, and he appears to be rather excited.\u0027 But as Trask headed for the Ops truck, Goodly had second thoughts; at least he made it seem that way. \u0027Oh, and Ben! Er, maybe you should take Jake with you? Introduce him to David ... ?\u0027The two of them looked at each other in passing, and Jake could swear some sort of silent exchange took place. Then Trask called back to him, \u0027Jake, if you\u0027d still like to know how you might fit in, perhaps you should come along with me.\u0027\n In the Ops Room, the Duty Officer and one other were on listening duty within the oval desk. The D.O. got out of the way when Trask lifted a flap in the desk, walked through and parked himself in the command chair. Jake followed and stood close behind him. Trask looked at the D.O. and said, \u0027Chung?\u0027\u0027London HQ, waiting,\u0027 the other nodded. \u0027Do you want him on-screen?\u0027\u0027Put him up there/ Trask said, indicating a screen on the wall. And the D.O. hit a switch.As the other lights dimmed a little, the wall screen flickered into life and its picture quickly firmed up. This was the first time Jake had seen E-Branch\u0027s chief locator, David Chung. He was small, middle-aged, Oriental as they come, and very serious-looking. And he was quite obviously highly intelligent. It was in his eyes just as it was in Trask\u0027s; a light behind them, shining out. But it was also in the high dome of his head. Jake didn\u0027t need advising of the extraordinary brain that was housed within. Chung\u0027s raven-black hair was thinning; there might even be a few strands of grey here and there. But his skin was clear and unwrinkled and his posture was ramrod-straight. He was sprightly, alert ... and excited, yes. That, too, showed in his eyes.\u0027Hi, David/ Trask greeted him with a smile - but in a moment got down to business. \u0027How did it go?\u0027 he said.\u0027Ben/ the other nodded, then immediately fixed his attention on Jake. And Jake could see that his curiosity was intense. But Trask had seen it, too. And:\u0027Save it/ he told the locator, his tone of voice carrying something of a warning. \u0027I suggest we deal with the other matter first.\u0027 And turning to the D.O.: \u0027Are we scrambled?\u0027\u0027Yes/ the D.O. nodded.And Chung said, \u0027All bad news, I\u0027m afraid. It\u0027s as Greenpeace and the others suspected. In fact, it\u0027s worse then anyone suspected. The Russians are still doing it, but now it\u0027s where they\u0027re doing it. You know, if we\u0027d had Anna-Marie English in on this we could have cracked it without even leaving the HQ?\u0027\u0027I know/ Trask answered, his shoulders slumping a little. \u0027But we don\u0027t have her, and anyway she\u0027s happier where she is - God99help us all! But is it really as bad as you make out? What, yet another treaty gone up in smoke - or nuclear pollution? I suppose you\u0027d better put me in the picture, but not on-screen. Let me have a printout.\u0027Chung spoke to someone off-screen, turned again to Trask. \u0027It\u0027ll take a few minutes. And later, when I\u0027ve done a little checking, I\u0027ll also be sending you, er, a weather report? Some unexpected smog? But I\u0027d like to check it out first and see if it\u0027s still hanging around, you know? Meanwhile, what about the other business?\u0027 His gaze switched however momentarily to Jake, then back to Trask.Understanding Chung\u0027s \u0027coded\u0027 message, Trask gave a cursory nod and said, \u0027Do you remember what happened at E-Branch HQ when Nathan arrived in Perchorsk? I mean you personally? Do you remember how you proved his identity, or his connection?\u0027Chung grinned, his excitement plainly in evidence. \u0027Do I remember? How could I ever forget? I\u0027m way ahead of you, Ben.\u0027 And he held up a hairbrush, showing it to Trask and Jake.\u0027I wasn\u0027t sure you still had it.\u0027 Trask sighed his relief. \u0027It wasn\u0027t in Harry\u0027s Room; I had it searched immediately after Jake... came visiting. But I knew that if you had it, it would be secure with your special items at the HQ. That\u0027s why I asked you to go and dig it out as soon as you got finished with what you were doing.\u0027Now the locator looked at Jake again and said, \u0027I suppose this is Jake Cutter?\u0027 He nodded a greeting. \u0027So why is he looking so - what, lost?\u0027\n Before Trask could answer, Jake leaned over him and said, \u0027I look so \"what, lost,\" as you put it - though personally I\u0027d prefer \"stunned\" - because no one has bothered to tell me what the fuck is going on! It\u0027s okay for E-Branch to put my life in jeopardy, set me in conflict with... I don\u0027t know - vampires? Mutated things? Alien invaders that live on the blood of human beings? - but totally out of the question to tell me what it\u0027s all in aid of. The human race, perhaps? Well, great! But since I\u0027m a member, don\u0027t / have any rucking say in the matter?\u0027\n \u0027Right first time,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027And on both counts. It\u0027s in aid of the human race, and no, you don\u0027t have any say in the matter.\u0027\n Chung saw now why the head of E-Branch was so cautious: as yet Jake Cutter knew very little. But Chung was already certain that Jake would have to know it all eventually. And so he said, \u0027That\u0027s fine for now, Ben. But if you\u0027re asking for my opinion, he\u0027ll have plenty of say in the not too distant future.\u0027Trask quickly held up his hand. \u0027We understand each other, and that\u0027s for the future - maybe. But don\u0027t say any more right now. Instead you can tell me about the brush.\u0027\u0027Oh, it\u0027s active,\u0027 Chung said. \u0027Very definitely. Why, it\u0027s like a live thing in my hand even now!\u0027 He looked at the man\u0027s hairbrush - just a well-used wooden oval tufted with pig bristles, some of them coming loose - and smiled. But alive? From what Jake could make out the brush was about as dead as ... as a piece of wood sprouting pig bristles!\u0027So,\u0027 said Trask, speaking to Chung. \u0027Can I take it you\u0027re thinking that just like once before maybe something of - well, let\u0027s for now call him a on\"-friend of ours - has come back to us? But if so, come back from where? And in what form?\u0027\u0027Absolutely,\u0027 Chung answered - then stopped smiling as the meaning of Trask\u0027s words sank in and he began to understand the other\u0027s caution. And: \u0027I think I see,\u0027 he said. \u0027So now we must ask ourselves whether or not it\u0027s beneficial. Is it here under the aegis of a friend, to help us, or is it here - ?\u0027\u0027 - For something else,\u0027 Trask cut the locator short. And after staring at him for a long moment, he said, \u0027That\u0027s it for now, David. Stay there at the HQ. The chair\u0027s yours until we\u0027re all sorted out at this end. Okay?\u0027\u0027Whatever you say,\u0027 Chung answered, his face once more inscrutable. And the D.O. blanked the screen ...\u0027What was all that about?\u0027 Jake queried the Head of E-Branch on the way to his tent. Trask had a \u0027room\u0027 in the Ops vehicle but preferred a little more space. In keeping with his status, his tent was somewhat bigger than a bivouac.\u0027When we have a little light, I\u0027ll show you/ Trask said. \u0027Some of it, anyway. From which time on you\u0027ll need to be aware that you\u0027ve signed the Official Secrets Act.\u0027\u0027But I haven\u0027t.\" Jake said.\u0027But if you ever give me reason, I\u0027ll say you have,\u0027 Trask grinned his cold grin. \u0027And you\u0027ll have to anyway, eventually.\u0027Jake snorted, said, \u0027Could this mean you\u0027re actually going to let me in on some secret or other?\u0027\u0027Sarcasm will get you nowhere,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027Except maybe in a whole lot of trouble.\u0027The camp wasn\u0027t far from the edge of a watering hole. Several large Australian night insects were fluttering, occasionally buzzing, through the smoky, flickering firelight. There were clusters of knobbly, fat-boled trees of a type Jake didn\u0027t recognize; Trask\u0027s tent stood shaded by one of these, in comparative darkness.Trask squeezed a rubber button on a cable hanging outside the tent, and as a light glowed within he drew aside the canvas flap and a fine-mesh gauze fly screen to invite Jake in. Inside, a folding table supported Trask\u0027s briefcase, a bottle of liquor, and two glasses. There were folding chairs and a camp bed, and in a screened-off corner a portable toilet. Comfortwise it was better than a bivouac, certainly, but scarcely luxurious.Trask sat Jake down, opened up his crammed briefcase, fumbled out a flat machine the size of a box of typing paper, and flipped a switch. The device whirred softly, and a slot opened in one end. Feeding Chung\u0027s printout into the slot, Trask said, \u0027It\u0027s enciphered, and this is a decoder.\u0027 \u0027Gadgets and ghosts,\u0027 said Jake.\u0027Yes,\u0027 Trask answered, \u0027I have to agree. This is certainly a gadget, and Chung\u0027s message is about ghosts - of a sort.\u0027\n \u0027Are you kidding me?\u0027 Jake couldn\u0027t any longer be sure of anything.\n \u0027I suppose I am,\u0027 Trask suddenly looked tired, \u0027though notnecessarily. Don\u0027t you believe in ghosts, Jake?\u0027 And before the other could answer: \u0027Well, these ghosts are submarines. They\u0027re dead Russian subs, yes - except they\u0027re still very much alive. Another paradox? Not really. Just wait a minute and you\u0027ll see what you\u0027ll see. Meanwhile, why don\u0027t you pour us a drink? And consider yourself lucky. It\u0027s Wild Turkey.\u0027Jake poured; the machine whirred; eventually two sheets of paper slid from the slot, pushed out and followed by the original. One of the decoded sheets was a-large-scale map of Europe and the seas around, with numbered, circled pinpoints of reference. The other was a list of grid references, numbered to correspond with those on the map. All of the grid references were oceanic: two pinpoints in the Black Sea off Varna in Bulgaria, another off Podisma in Turkey; two more in the Tyrrhenian midway between Naples and Sardinia; one in the Atlantic off Portugal\u0027s Algarve; and three more between Iceland and Norway, south of the Arctic Circle. And there were others marked out by tiny question marks instead of dots. Looking at these little black marks on the map, and matching them with the grid references, Trask\u0027s expression was very bleak.\u0027Look there,\u0027 he indicated the question marks. \u0027As close to home as that: the Barents Sea, off Norway. Crazy!\u0027\u0027Close to home?\u0027 Jake echoed him.\u0027Close to the former Soviet Union,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027Odd, because the Russians are usually more careful than that. Chernobyl taught them that much of a lesson at least - taught them to look after their own, anyway. So maybe those two were accidental? Maybe they didn\u0027t intend for them to go down just there. Jesus, but whatever they intended, still it\u0027s a mess!\u0027I\u0027m not with you,\u0027 said Jake, shaking his head.\u0027Then let me explain. Each of those pinpoints represents a hulk resting on the bottom. But what kind of hulk? The answer\u0027s almost unbelievable, but since I\u0027ve already told you ...\u0027\u0027Submarines?\u0027Trask nodded. \u0027Those innocuous little black dots? Each one of them is a disaster just waiting to happen or already happening. They\u0027re allegedly \"decommissioned\" nuclear subs we thought had been cleaned up, made safe, taken apart and stored with ten thousand tons of other radioactive rubbish years ago. Relics of Russia\u0027s penniless, outmoded, unwanted Cold War navy, yes. But the Russian military was lying to us - which is nothing new - and this is the truth.\u0027\u0027And it\u0027s a bad thing?\u0027 Jake still didn\u0027t see it. \u0027I mean that these things have been sent to the bottom, miles deep, out of harm\u0027s way?\u0027\u0027Out of harm\u0027s way? God, what an infant!\u0027 Trask shook his head. And before Jake could get upset again:\u0027Look, most of these subs have twin atomic engines. There are two possible meltdowns in each hulk. Barely possible, mind you, but possible. We don\u0027t know if they\u0027ve been shut down properly, or even if they could be. But the very means of disposal tells us they\u0027re less than safe! Why else would the Russian military dump them on someone else\u0027s doorstep? What\u0027s more - since they\u0027re capable of this - how do we know they didn\u0027t load them to the gills with other high-level waste before scuttling them? What? They might have even left their leaking missile payloads aboard. These were ships of war, Jake! And sooner or later the bastard things will start spilling their guts!\u0027\u0027What, in ten, twenty, fifty years? And a mile or so deep?\u0027 Jake still wasn\u0027t too impressed. \u0027And anyway, what has this to do with you and E-Branch?\u0027Trask scowled at him, actually clenched a fist and thumped the table. \u0027If Anna-Marie English were here right now ... she\u0027d knock you arse over breakfast!\u0027Astonished, Jake drew back. \u0027Anna-Marie English? Isn\u0027t she someone who Chung mentioned?\u0027\n \u0027She worked for us,\u0027 Trask snapped. \u0027An ecopath, she gave warning of Earth\u0027s decline - I mean personally. She was \"ecologically aware,\" or as she herself would put it, she was \"as one with the Earth\". It was her talent - or her curse. Funny, isn\u0027t it,\n Jake? But there are very few in E-Branch who are happy with their talents. They would much prefer to be ordinary. But since they can\u0027t be, they\u0027re E-Branch.\u0027Jake wasn\u0027t.sure of Trask\u0027s meaning. \u0027So how did this help you? Her talent, I mean? How did it work?\u0027Trask shook his head. \u0027None of us can tell you how our talents work, only that they do. In Anna-Marie\u0027s case:\u0027As water tables declined and deserts expanded, so her skin dried out, became desiccated. When acid rains burned the Scandinavian forests, her dandruff fell like snow. In her dreams she heard whale species singing of their decline and inevitable extinction, and she knew from her aching bones when the Japanese were slaughtering the dolphins. She was like a human lodestone; she tracked illicit nuclear waste, monitored pollution, shrank from holes in the ozone layer. Anna-Marie was an ecopath, Jake: she felt for the Earth and suffered all its sicknesses, because she knew that she was dying from them, too ...\u0027Trask was eloquent, Jake would grant him that much. \u0027You\u0027re saying she\u0027s dead, then?\u0027\u0027No,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027I\u0027m saying she\u0027s somewhere else. But by now... she might well have started to suffer again, yes ...\u0027 He sighed and sat up straighter, seemed on the brink of coming to a decision, finally continued:\u0027Me, I believe in ghosts, Jake. I really do, for I\u0027ve seen a few in my time. And they weren\u0027t always of the moaning, chain-rattling and mainly harmless variety. But I also believe in listening to my colleagues. Now it seems a ghost has come among us, possibly a beneficial one. Well, according to Chung and Goodly, anyway. Unfortunately it\u0027s come at a very bad time. The coincidence is just too great - that this should happen now, just as we find ourselves in conflict with the Wamphyri and the plague they\u0027ve brought with them out of Starside - for me to take any chances. That\u0027s what holds me back from telling you everything: the thought that perhaps you are an agent, albeit an unwitting agent, of the Wamphyri!\u0027\n \u0027Me?\u0027 Jake\u0027s surprise couldn\u0027t have been more genuine. And Trask, a human lie detector, knew it more certainly than any other man ever could. Ah, but Trask remembered other times, when Harry Keogh had fooled him, too! And Jake went on, \u0027How in hell could I be anyone\u0027s agent? And I\u0027m certainly no ghost!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Trask agreed, \u0027but what\u0027s in you might be.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s in me?\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t play the fool, Jake!\u0027 Trask snapped. \u0027We\u0027re talking about what\u0027s in your head. This talent you\u0027ve suddenly come by, which brought you to E-Branch and then returned you there when you tried to run off. But is it the ghost of Harry Keogh - or is it something that merely tastes like him? Should I take you into my confidence, or shoot you dead right here and now?\u0027Jake started to his feet and upset the table. His face was a snarl, his hands reaching for Trask. \u0027I\u0027ve had it up to here with your threats and your bullying. You\u0027re an old man, Trask, and as far as I\u0027m concerned you\u0027re an old fraud ... too!?\u0027But by then he\u0027d seen the gun that Trask had been holding under the table; it was aimed right at him. And he understood the other\u0027s apparent fumbling when he\u0027d taken the decoder from his briefcase. But what he didn\u0027t understand was the way Trask stared at him, the urgent, burning question in his penetrating gaze.\u0027What would you have done?\u0027 Trask snapped. \u0027What would you have done to me?\u0027\u0027Done?\u0027 Jake looked at the gun, then at Trask. \u0027Nothing. I... I might have shaken you, or tried to shake some sense into you. Or maybe I\u0027d have tried shaking a little out of you! God, can\u0027t you see you\u0027ve got me going in circles?\u0027And Trask actually smiled as he slowly lowered his gun and put it away. \u0027Yes, I can see that,\u0027 he nodded. With which Jake got the idea.\u0027What? Another bloody test?\u0027\n \u0027To push you hard,\u0027 Trask told him, \u0027and see what answered. You ... or something else.\u0027\n \u0027Well, if I were you,\u0027 Jake said, \u0027I would have supposed it was something else!\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027re not me,\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027And you passed. That leaves just one more test to go.\u0027\n \u0027Then let\u0027s get it over with.\u0027\u0027Not now, no.\u0027\u0027When, then?\u0027\u0027Tomorrow morning. I\u0027m having a man flown in from Carnarvon on the coast. An expatriate Brit, and the best in his field.\u0027\u0027What, yet another great \"talent?\"\u0027 Jake was still angry.\u0027Not the way you mean,\u0027 Trask shook his head. \u0027But he has talent enough, yes. Oh, and by the way: that\u0027s some temper you have, Jake. You said you might have shaken me? Well, you shook me all right. I thought you might actually attack me!\u0027Jake relaxed a little, grinned. \u0027I scared you?\u0027\u0027I was scared I might have to shoot you, yes.\u0027But before that could start Jake off again, a voice called from outside the tent. \u0027Mr Trask? Phillips here. We have a bit of a problem.\u0027 A male figure stood silhouetted behind the gauze fly screen. Trask let him in, said:\u0027Shouldn\u0027t you be on your way to Carnarvon?\u0027\u0027Would be/ said the other, \u0027if not for this problem. Its name is Peter Miller, and it won\u0027t get its ugly arse out of my chopper!\u0027 The speaker was small and young, and looked very hot, sticky, and agitated in his flyer\u0027s gear.\u0027Miller\u0027s in your machine?\u0027 Trask raised an eyebrow, then nodded decisively. \u0027So he wants out of here. And once away, he intends to take his story to the authorities or, worse, to some newspaper or other. Well, it can\u0027t be allowed. Yes, I want rid of him. No, I don\u0027t want the trouble he\u0027ll bring. Only a handful of people in the very highest places know what we\u0027re doing, and if we\u0027re compromised it will make them look bad. As for the man in the street... well, it\u0027s simply out of the question. The world\u0027s insecure enough as it is.\u0027\n He turned to Jake. \u0027Go and find Lardis Lidesci, will you? Bring him to the chopper park in the clearing on the far side of the road.\u0027 And speaking again to Phillips, \u0027You and me ... let\u0027s go and have a word with Mr Miller.\u0027\u0027Just what is that fat jerk doing here, anyway?\u0027 Jake wanted to know.\u0027He was supposed to give us some legitimacy,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027He\u0027s liaison, a go-between, that\u0027s all. But he took his job too seriously, discovered the location of our original base camp near Lake Disappointment, which is after all his province, and since then he\u0027s insisted on staying aboard. Well, with us is one thing, but against us is another. Now, after seeing far too much of what we\u0027re about, he\u0027s all too eager to leave. I can\u0027t very well stop him, but I really should warn him against doing anything stupid. Now go and get Lardis, will you?\u0027And Trask and Phillips went off through the night.,.The Old Lidesci was in a foldaway chair, dozing by the guttering campfire. But as Jake approached he gave a start and looked up. \u0027Eh, what is it?\u0027\u0027Trask wants you,\u0027 Jake told him. \u0027At the helicopter park. Some trouble with Mrs Miller.\u0027\u0027Mrs? Eh?\u0027 Lardis frowned at first, then burst out laughing. \u0027Oh! Ha~ha~ha!Rut you know, the truth is I\u0027ve been thinking much the same thing: how that poor excuse for a man reminds me of a chattering old woman? A week on Sunside would sort that one out, I fancy. But no, no ... the poor bastard wouldn\u0027t last but a day.\u0027Jake assisted him to his feet and the Old Lidesci stamped his left foot a little. \u0027Cramp,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m getting past it. We call it The Crippler, where I\u0027m from. But it\u0027s rheum - er, rheuma - er ...\u0027\u0027Rheumatism?\u0027 Jake said.\u0027Damn, right!\u0027 said Lardis. \u0027It\u0027s rheumatism here. Ah, but it\u0027s a sod in any world.\u0027\n And with the old man leaning a little on Jake\u0027s arm, they made for the road and the helicopter park ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-8.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. \n Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. \n If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. \n But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry.
