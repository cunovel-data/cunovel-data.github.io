{"id":97225,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Synchronicity AgainThe safe house set aside for E-Branch use was in the New Marchant Park district, north of the city. An ugly two-storey affair, it had aluminium cladding designed and painted in a rather poor imitation of timber; Brisbane no longer favoured wooden structures of any kind.The house was set back from the road up a short palm-lined drive; its gate was remote-controlled from inside the lead limo and opened into a featureless garden. Two medium-sized, innocuous-looking saloon cars stood on a gravel drive in front of the house. In fact they were fitted with bullet-proof windows, heavily-plated bodywork, hidden roll-bars and other anti-crash/anti-terforist devices. Short of a bomb-blast or a head-on collision at speed, no one was going to come to harm driving one of these vehicles. They were for the use of Trask and his people.\n Laid to lawn and enclosed within high stone walls, the garden was on a level and surrounded the house on all sides; every inch of grass (or straw as it was now) was clearly visible from the windows of both storeys. Of the house itself: it had bullet-proof, heavily curtained windows, and a security/intruder warning system second to none. In plan, the ground floor consisted of four long rooms, one on each side, each furnished and decorated in a slightly out-of-date style, with little or nothing to show that the place was anything other than a fairly expensive private dwelling house. The central room, however, which wasn\u0027t visible from the gardens, was an operational and communications nerve centre of screens and computerized equipment.The sleeping quarters (in fact a pair of cramped dormitories with beds for up to fourteen people, or maybe eighteen at a push, and a handful of curtained-off, cell-like units for VIPs) were upstairs. And overhead on the roof, a bank of \u0027solar-heating panels\u0027 (tinted windows) concealed an array of hi-tech communications aerials and dishes.The agent-chauffeurs showed Trask and his crew of six over the house, asked how they could help them settle in or if there was anything else they needed. Trask checked with Jimmy Harvey and Paul Arenson - in their element as they switched on and got acquainted with the gadgets in the ops room - and Arenson told him:\u0027We\u0027re fully compatible throughout. Give us ten minutes to hook our stuff up to this lot, and we\u0027ll have the HQDuty Officer up there on that big screen so clear you\u0027ll think you\u0027re in London.\u0027\u0027Scrambled?\u0027 Trask wasn\u0027t that easily satisfied.\u0027As per SOPs, yes,\u0027 said the other.At which Trask thanked the ASI men (Australian Special Intelligence), who headed back to the airstrip to connect with incoming Chopper Two\u0027s military commanders and three more members of Branch ground staff. Once they were in, and until the slower back-up squads of Australian SAS types had arrived and taken up their tactical locations, the advance party was on its own...In fact, it took the technicians half an hour to complete their hook-up. Meanwhile an uncharacteristically subdued Liz had brewed a pot of Earl Grey for Trask and herself, coffee for Jake and the others. Goodly had taken his coffee through into ops. Trask was enjoying his tea in one of the living rooms while poring over a small-scale map of the Queensland/New South Wales border areas. It was somewhere there, in the vicinity of the border, that the locator Chung had detected mindsmog, probably due to the381mental activity of a master vampire, Wamphyri! Probably, but not definitely, not with one hundred per cent certainty; the Branch had long since discovered psychic \u0027hotspots\u0027 where a proliferation of lesser, human ESP talents could produce the same result. It had been David Chung\u0027s \u0027hunch\u0027, however, that this time it was the real thing, which the synchronous \u0027coincidence\u0027 of vampire lieutenant Bruce Trennier\u0027s death had seemed to confirm.Jake took his coffee over to where Trask worked, watched him use a red highlighter to plot a dotted line along the border from Stanthorpe to Coolangatta, then circle the whole area in a ring of pale red ink. As Trask looked up from what he was doing, Jake lifted an enquiring eyebrow.\u0027If our target is here/ Trask explained, \u0027and if he has established himself, then he\u0027s somewhere inside this ring. Personally, I fancy he is. I\u0027ve known David Chung for a long time and he doesn\u0027t make too many mistakes. It was Chung who discovered Trennier. Once we had an approximate location, we checked with the local police and picked up on a handful of disappearances - Trennier\u0027s recruits, those creatures we killed at the Old Mine gas station. That one was fairly easy; in a region as thinly populated as the Gibson Desert, people are wont to take notice when their kith and kin cease to exist! But here in the east, on the coastal strip ...\u0027 He paused, glanced again at the map, shook his head.\u0027Densely populated,\u0027 Jake nodded. \u0027And that circle you\u0027ve drawn covers, what - maybe five, six thousand square miles?\u0027\u0027Closer to eight,\u0027 Trask corrected him glumly. \u0027And folks disappear around here every other half-hour, about the same as they do in similar areas of population all over the world.\u0027Lardis Lidesci had been talking to Liz. Now he came over, put a gnarled finger on the map and growled, \u0027These?\u0027 \u0027Mountains,\u0027 Trask answered.\n \u0027Huh!\u0027 Lardis grunted. \u0027Thought so. And the border follows the mountains, right?\u0027\n \u0027In part,\u0027 Trask nodded. \u0027A natural boundary, yes.\u0027\u0027An wnnatural boundary, in Sunside/Starsidef Lardis said. \u0027But there again, the Barrier Mountains are different entirely, and they never knew sunlight such as these mountains have seen. But beggars, and even the Wamphyri, can\u0027t be choosers. Not in a world like this. So there you are. And now maybe you can narrow it down.\u0027\n Concentrating on the map, Trask was only half-listening to what Lardis was saying. But in another moment he looked up from where he sat at the table. \u0027Eh?\u0027\u0027Mountains,\u0027 Lardis said. 1 understand \u0027em. And so do the Wamphyri. If this one\u0027s a Lord, where do you think he\u0027ll be?\u0027\u0027Where do I think - ?\u0027 Trask frowned, looked again at the map, then came erect and snapped his fingers.\u0027In the mountains, aye,\u0027 Lardis anticipated him, scowling in his fashion. \u0027In his aerie, of course. That\u0027s a logical con - er, conclusion? - wouldn\u0027t you say? And here\u0027s another: if it is one of them, it isn\u0027t Szwart. What, in all this heat and light? No way - not a chance. It\u0027s too much for me, let alone for Lord Szwart. Huh! Darkness himself, that one!\u0027And: \u0027Damn! You\u0027re probably right!\u0027 Trask husked.At which point lan Goodly returned from the ops room. \u0027Up and running,\u0027 he said. \u0027And Ben, David Chung\u0027s on-screen, wanting to speak to you ...\u0027\u0027I have some hot-off-the-press news for you,\u0027 Chung told Trask as he seated himself within the screen\u0027s viewing arc.\u0027Big deal,\u0027 Trask answered wearily, with a touch of sarcasm but no real malice. \u0027Just about any news fits that description! We\u0027ve been busy, air-mobile, and only just got settled in here. So, what\u0027s going down in your neck of the woods that\u0027s such hot stuff?\u0027Chung shrugged. \u0027In my neck of the woods? Not a lot. But in yours: an opportunity to speak to an old pal of ours, maybe, if that\u0027s of any interest?\u0027 And then, more seriously: \u0027It\u0027s Gustav Turchin. He\u0027s going to be there at the Earth Year Conference in Brisbane. The time in the City is now - \u0027 he glanced off-screen \u0027 - a little after eight a.m. But just an hour ago Turchin himself was on-screen, unscrambled, from Moscow. He was interested to know if you\u0027d be attending the conference. He was very careful, oh-so-polite, and diplomatic as usual, but John Grieve was doing Duty Officer and read him like a book. Premier Turchin is eager to see you, Ben. It was a last-minute call, probably monitored, before he boarded an Aeroflot VTOL Atmozkim to Brisbane. And John says Turchin stressed the fact that he would be accompanied by \"several members of his staff ...\u0027\u0027That\u0027s very interesting,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027His bodyguards will be special police, KGB lookalikes - watchdogs for the real leaders, all the military types like Mikhail Suvorov - who will be making sure he doesn\u0027t step out of line. So maybe Turchin is on his way out, his days of power at an end. But of course I\u0027ll see him. I have a few questions for him, and while he still has some pull there\u0027s a favour I need to ask of him ...\u0027 Trask glanced at Jake, perhaps musingly, then turned back to the screen.\u0027So thanks for the information, David,\u0027 he continued, \u0027and you can be sure I\u0027ll act on it. But now I\u0027d like you to tell me something about our main problem. How is the search going? Have you picked up anything new to corroborate your original lead?\u0027Chung pulled a wry face. \u0027There\u0027s something there, I would swear to that. But it\u0027s too distant, too shielded, literally on the other side of the world! Your side of the world, Ben. Which is where I have to be if you want any kind of accuracy. I mean, how can I be expected to locate someone or something through eight thousand miles of solid rock and white-hot magma?\u0027 \u0027You want in on this?\u0027 Trask\u0027s face was a blank. \u0027Absolutely!\u0027\u0027And you wouldn\u0027t be playing on your talent simply so you can come swarming around out here?\u0027\n Chung\u0027s face showed his confusion. For the truth was that he would dearly love to go \u0027swarming around\u0027 in Australia with his E-Branch colleagues - and if he denied it Trask would know he was lying! So after letting his face work its way through a number of mutually contradictory expressions, finally he said, \u0027But isn\u0027t that the wrong question? What you should have asked is, do I think I\u0027ll be better placed to find what we\u0027re searching for if I\u0027m out there with you?... To which I would have to answer, yes.\u0027At which Trask\u0027s stony expression broke and he grinned. \u0027I know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m good at asking awkward questions, right?\u0027\u0027Too true!\u0027 Chung rubbed his chin and looked hurt - until a moment later, when Trask said:\u0027Okay, so how soon can you be out here? The fact is you\u0027ll come in useful apprising Premier Turchin first-hand of all that you\u0027ve discovered about the Russian navy\u0027s illegal pollution of the world\u0027s oceans ... and in Earth Year at that! Which in turn will afford me a little more leverage on what I would like from him. That\u0027s if leverage is required, which I doubt. For, in fact, Gustav Turchin isn\u0027t a bad sort of bloke.\u0027Watching Chung\u0027s face come alive with anticipation on the wall screen, Jake thought: Synchronicity again! Like some kind of weird word~association. E-Branch: Gustav Turchin: the down-at-heel Russian military\u0027s systematic pollution of the oceans: the Earth Year eco~summit. And all of it coming together right here and now, in Brisbane - along with a whole hunch of other shit, possihly.And meanwhile, with a smile as broad as his face, the locator was saying, \u0027I, er, already mentioned the possibility that I mightbe needed to John Grieve. He\u0027s happy to take over here, and there\u0027ll be no shortage of staff in support. So ... when is the next flight out?\u0027Trask nodded, knowingly. \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be able to check that out for yourself,\u0027 he said. \u0027Er, if you haven\u0027t already.\u0027And Chung laughed and said, \u0027I have an hour and forty minutes to make Heathrow!\u0027\u0027I thought so,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027Very well, lan Goodly can get his head down now and pick you up in the wee small hours at the airport. You\u0027ll travel under an assumed identity, of course.\u0027\u0027Of course.\u0027 And Chung was still grinning his delight when Trask broke the connection...Chung wasn\u0027t the only one who was met at the airport in the wee small hours. Premier Gustav Turchin was there first,385along with his minder entourage. No one paid them much attention.Russia was no longer a world superpower - in fact, she was rapidly crumbling, held under siege not by the world community but from within her own borders by political and ideological intractability, corruption, organized crime, and desperate poverty - but still Turchin was recognized as a world leader of sorts, if only a figurehead without any real power. In any case the Earth Year Conference wasn\u0027t diplomacy-conscious; it wasn\u0027t that kind of venue: the eco-summit\u0027s organizers were not so much standing on ceremony as requiring action.Australia, now a republic and a very powerful nation in its own right, was still viewed as a \u0027clean\u0027 country and was determined to stay that way. While the all too frequent El Ninos and other ecological disasters were not caused by Australians, Australians were suffering their consequences. Now they and other like-minded - indeed right-minded - countries were considering real action, political, legal, and economic, against nations with bad-to-criminal ecological records. Since Russia was reckoned more than merely \u0027suspect\u0027 in this regard, and since Premier Turchin\u0027s attendance had been an eleventh-hour decision, no red-carpet arrangements had been made for him and his party.A limo and driver had been arranged - which was literally the least that the organizers could do without being seen to be rude - but Trask had seen to it that these had been called off. This hadn\u0027t been the easiest thing in the world to arrange, but Trask\u0027s connections were second to none.Diplomatic immunity saw the Russian Premier and his poker-faced party of four clone-like minders through the international airport\u0027s red-tape entry procedures without too much fuss, each man carrying his own spartan to modest luggage, until they were met in the arrivals lounge by a pair of\u0027chauffeurs\u0027 who introduced themselves as \u0027Mr Smith\u0027 and \u0027Mr Brown\u0027.\n Swiftly escorted to the carport by Smith and Brown, Turchin was bundled into the back of the first limo... the doors of which immediately clicked shut and locked, all except the driver\u0027s door, which stood open. And before the jet-lagged, travel-disorientated quartet of grey-suits could even begin to object, Mr Smith slid into the driver\u0027s seat and drove away.\n As the minders got into the second limo, one of them growled a concerned, heavily accented: \u0027Who was that man sitting in the front of the first car?\u0027\u0027Er, that was Mr Smith,\u0027 said Mr Brown. \u0027I believe he\u0027s an important convention official. It seemed only right that a person of stature should welcome your Premier personally.\u0027\u0027Oh, indeed, yes!\u0027 said the other, gruffly. And then, with a frown: \u0027But, er ... wasn\u0027t the driver also Mr Smith?\u0027\u0027That\u0027s correct,\u0027 said Brown, quickly recovering from his gaffe. \u0027We have an awful lot of Smiths, you know - and Browns, too, for that matter. Why, we even had a Prime Minister called Smith once over! And anyway, what\u0027s wrong with that? I imagine it\u0027s much the same with Ivans and Ivanovs in your country.\u0027\u0027Yes, certainly. I understand. Pardon me. Ahem!\u0027 To cover his embarrassment, the minder coughed into a handkerchief.Over the intercom Mr Brown chuckled and said, \u0027Let\u0027s face it, this is Australia! I mean, who did you think would be meeting you - Marx and Engels?\u0027\u0027Oh, ha ha ha ha!\u0027 The minders laughed woodenly, almost in unison. \u0027No, not at all. Indeed, no!\u0027 But when they\u0027d quietened down, their head man cautiously enquired, \u0027Er, how long will it be before we get to the hotel?\u0027\u0027Eh?\u0027 said Mr Brown, grinning. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t really know, mate. All I know is I have orders to tail the car in front, and that\u0027s it. About an hour, at a guess - maybe more, maybe less. But now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I have to concentrate on my driving.\u0027\u0027Yes, of course. Just as long as you stay right behind the car in front.\u0027 But the car in front was already out of sight.\u0027Oh, don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t lose him. No fear of that. But I do understand your concern. It must be very daunting, having to keep an eye on someone like Gustav Turchin. What, dodgy is he?\u0027\n But now Mr Brown\u0027s familiarity was getting to be too much. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 the leading grey-suit said stiffly. \u0027Did you say dodgy? Something about keeping an eye on him? Now you listen to me, Mr ...\u0027\u0027... Well, that\u0027s what you are, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 Brown cut him off. \u0027I mean, just how long have you lot been special policemen anyway - or KGB as was - or whatever you call yourselves now?\u0027But suddenly the four were very tight-lipped, scowling at each other. And with his mouth twitching in one corner, and his eyes like black marbles, their leader slowly answered, \u0027We have been -ah, shall we say, specialists? - a lot longer, I fancy, than you have been a chauffeur, Mr Brown!\u0027At which Brown looked back, grinned, and then switched off the intercom...Out on the airport service road, Trask got out of the front of the limo and into the back with Turchin. Then they shook hands, and Turchin hugged him in a typically Russian greeting. \u0027Funny, but we\u0027ve never met person to person/ Turchin said then. \u0027Yet it seems I know you.\u0027\u0027A meeting of minds, perhaps?\u0027 said Trask. And, \u0027Listen, I apologize for the subterfuge back there, but your friends - \u0027\u0027No friends of mine!\u0027 Turchin cut him short. \u0027Indeed, they are only here to make sure I don\u0027t talk out of turn. But before you ask ... yes, I do know about the despicable and destructive activities of our armed forces. They are like dogs fouling someone else\u0027s garden. But Trask, understand this: I am not the one who let those dogs off the leash. In today\u0027s Russia, my friend, they roam wild. Indeed, I\u0027ve been lucky to hold on to what small degree of power still remains to me. But if I were to tell this conference everything I know, then even that would be lost, and our currently uneasy east-west relationship would slip a little bit farther downhill.\u0027\n Trask nodded. \u0027I understand, and it\u0027s much as I suspected. But Premier, you don\u0027t have to explain to me, not about that, at least. And I know that you won\u0027t be able - won\u0027t be allowed - to explain it to the conference. So, why are you here?\u0027 He fell silent, wanting to let the other do the talking. Maybe he would learn more that way.\u0027How long do we have?\u0027 Turchin inquired.\u0027The drivers are taking the scenic route,\u0027 Trask told him. I\u0027ve asked for half an hour at least, an hour at most. In fact we could be at your hotel in twenty minutes, but I wasn\u0027t quite sure what degree of privacy you\u0027d have later.\u0027\u0027Half an hour?\u0027 Turchin nodded. \u0027Good. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s going to be enough, but we\u0027ll need to get on. As for privacy later - huh!\u0027\u0027My fault,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027I should have been more subtle. I didn\u0027t want to compromise you, but I simply didn\u0027t have time to make any other arrangements.\u0027\u0027No,\u0027 Turchin shook his head. \u0027It\u0027s just how things are. I have made myself unpopular with certain people. If a country is rich and strong and its people are well fed, then maybe the man in charge can afford to be unpopular and do things his own way. Me, I can\u0027t afford to do anything my own way! The only reason I hold on is in the hope that things will change. But change is a long time coming.\u0027Trask had been studying him. The Russian Premier wasn\u0027t by any means the same man he\u0027d known previously. Even though Trask had only ever seen him in television broadcasts or on-screen at E-Branch HQ, still he had radiated a lot more power than he did now. And Trask\u0027s mind took him back to a time all of five years ago, when he had negotiated a course of action on the Perchorsk Gate with this selfsame man:Then, Gustav Turchin had seemed unshakeable. He had been a rock of a man. Blockily built, square of face and short in the neck- with a shock of black hair, bushy black eyebrows, dark, glinting eyes over a blunt nose, and an unemotional mouth - he had been a veritable bulldog. But even then the Premier had had problems. Coinciding with Trask\u0027s, they had served to bring the two together in a mutually beneficial understanding.Now ... there had been changes. Turchin was a lot thinner, grey-streaked where his hair was brushed back from his temples, less bright and sharp of eye; even his voice had lost something of its former authority. The intellect was still there - still lethal, Trask supposed - but the drive was failing. Seven years of political power, and nothing to show for it, had taken their toll of him.But the way the Russian Premier was studying Trask ... the head of E-Branch couldn\u0027t suppress a snort of self-derision. If he found Turchin changed, what must Turchin think of him? As if reading his mind, the other said:\u0027The years haven\u0027t been kind to us.\u0027And Trask smiled wrily and answered, \u0027It\u0027s not so much the years as the mileage.\u0027 Then he stopped smiling and said, \u0027We\u0027ve not long had definite evidence about what your navy is doing. I certainly won\u0027t be saying anything about it here in Brisbane. I wouldn\u0027t embarrass you like that. In fact, I\u0027m not here on Earth Year business at all, and I doubt if I\u0027ll attend a single session. But you should know that sooner or later - probably sooner - I\u0027ll have to bring it to the attention of our Minister Responsible, and that he has obligations, too.\u0027\u0027I appreciate that, er, Benjamin?\u0027 \u0027Ben.\u0027\u0027Then by all means call me Gustav. But you are not the only one whose purpose here is other than it seems. Indeed, I am here simply because you are here! Oh, they have been badgering me to attend these things all over the world, but so far I\u0027ve managed to hold them off. The admirals, generals, despoilers, et cetera, requiring me to lie for them - huh! Well, and now that I\u0027m here I shall lie for them, telling Brisbane and all the world of the marvellous efforts Russia is making to clean up her act. But you and I, we know the truth. And, as you have pointed out, so will everyone else in the not too distant future. Unfortunately, that is the least of my worries - or if not the least, it is not my major concern. No, for that is something else entirely.\u0027\n Trask nodded. He remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments, then said, \u0027Perhaps I can anticipate you? I think it\u0027s only fair to tell you that I\u0027m also aware that Mikhail\n Suvorov has led an alleged \"expeditionary\" party of soldiers and scientists through the Perchorsk Gate into Sunside/Starside, Nathan Keogh\u0027s world.\u0027Now it was Gustav Turchin\u0027s turn to smile wrily. \u0027Ah!\u0027 he said. \u0027The Opposition! And sharp as ever. Yes, and you are correct: that is my problem. But, alas, it\u0027s also yours.\u0027\u0027Probably more than you suspect,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027But perhaps I should hear your side of the story first.\u0027\u0027My side is simple,\u0027 said the other. \u0027Five years ago, when Turkur Tzonov escaped justice in Perchorsk by fleeing into Starside, some of his dupes were taken prisoner. That was a mistake on my part; I should have had them shot for mutiny, conspiracy, desertion of duty, sabotage ... oh, half a dozen charges. But I didn\u0027t, and one of them talked to Mikhail Suvorov. Not the best possible move, for fehad them shot! Or rather, he saw to their disposal. There were several very unfortunate accidents.\u0027Trask understood, and said, \u0027Which left General Suvorov as the sole heir to whatever he could steal from Sunside/Starside. He knew that the Gate would lead him into an alien world, knew about the gold, and wanted it for himself\u0027The gold and whatever else he could find there,\u0027 Turchin answered. \u0027A whole new world, which he would annex and rape for its riches. And he would have control of the Gate. Why, in retrospect it seems perfectly obvious: if Suvorov had wanted these things for the good of his country, for Russia - which was what he told me - then surely he would have explained his purpose to everyone; to his military colleagues and the whole country, and not just... not just to me.\u0027 He turned his face away.\u0027He told you he was going through the Gate? And you didn\u0027t try to stop him?\u0027 Trask believed he understood something of the predicament Turchin must have faced, but wanted to hear it from the horse\u0027s mouth.\u0027How could I stop him?\u0027 Turchin threw up his hands. \u0027After the Perchorsk Complex was flooded, a task force of military engineers was sent in to strip and salvage lead from the shielding in the ravine. That was what I was led to believe, though later it turned out that wasn\u0027t all they were there for. Anyway, many of these men were long-term criminals from the punishment garrisons at Beresov and Ukhta. Hand-picked by Mikhail Suvorov, they had been given the choice of serving out their sentences or serving him: his first step towards securing Perchorsk. In return, and after the job was done and everyone else had moved out, Suvorov let them stay on and turn the dry upper levels into living quarters serviced by hydroelectric power from the dam. They had vehicles, and documentation that allowed them to resupply themselves from Beresov. From then on they were the \"official\" team of engineers, responsible for servicing and running the dam. As for the dam\u0027s continued existence: that was easily justified in that the bulk of its electrical power had been re-routed to the service of local logging camps and other communities...\u0027\u0027And you were in the dark about all this?\u0027 Despite Trask\u0027s respect for the other - and the fact that so far the Premier\u0027s every word had been the truth - still he was relentless in his pusuit of all the answers.\u0027I was kept in the dark about it!\u0027 Turchin told him. \u0027Ben, I don\u0027t control the armed forces and I never have. If they want me to know something, then they tell me. And if I require their services, I tell them. And that\u0027s it.\u0027\u0027Bringing a democracy to life isn\u0027t easy,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027Neither is killing Communism!\u0027 said the other, then went on to explain: \u0027Oh, they are still there, the hard-liners. And so we\u0027re - how do you say it - between a rock and a hard place? The old guard on the one hand, and all the greedy opportunists, like Suvorov, on the other. Do you know what happens to a Russian bank if it runs out of money?\u0027Trask shrugged. \u0027It goes bankrupt?\u0027\n \u0027No, they turn it into a pizza house! Huh! Among the Muscovites, that is currently a \"joke.\" Here\u0027s another that\u0027s not so funny: what does a General do when there\u0027s no money to fund his parades or pay his troops, and his pension\u0027s only good for cheap vodka and cabbage soup?\u0027\n And Trask nodded. \u0027He goes gold-prospecting. But you know, no one lives forever. Not me and not you. Somewhere there must be documentation on the Perchorsk Project, the Gate, the complex, and everything that happened there. While we\u0027re alive, of course we\u0027ll do our best to protect such records, such secrets. But when we\u0027re dead or no longer in office - what then? If not Suvorov, sooner or later someone else would have tried it.\u0027\n \u0027I thought of that a long time ago,\u0027 said Turchin. \u0027Also, I liked Nathan and I\u0027m sure I would like his people. There was something about him that was very Russian, you know? And in my way, well, I\u0027m a humanitarian, too ... you\u0027ll just have to take my word for that. So, I took what precautions I could.\u0027\u0027Precautions?\u0027\u0027Long before Mikhail Suvorov found out about Perchorsk, I was destroying everything I could find on that place. Every bit of documentation, records, reports, you name it. Not the experiment, you understand, not the Projekt itself - for it\u0027s better that men should learn from their mistakes - but the horror that came after it, the very knowledge of a vampire world. And I was quite successful, perhaps even too successful. For now ... why, even the so-called Opposition knows a lot more about it than I do, and certainly more than anyone else!\u0027\u0027We always did,\u0027 said Trask.\u0027Of course you did, yes - and of course you do - for you have even been there, to Nathan Keogh\u0027s world in an alien parallel dimension. But isn\u0027t that a peculiar circumstance in itself, since Perchorsk and the Gate lie deep inside my homeland? And if you were me, wouldn\u0027t you feel... left out?\u0027\u0027Not really,\u0027 Trask shook his head. \u0027No one who saw what I saw, experienced what I experienced, would ever want to go back there. Believe me, you must consider yourself fortunate. And as for General Mikhail Suvorov: well, you can consider him unfortunate. He\u0027s dead, Gustav.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 And Turchin lifted a great bush of an eyebrow. \u0027Does that explain it, then? The accident or vandalism or whatever it was at the Romanian Refuge? Was that Suvorov?\u0027\u0027You know about the Refuge?\u0027\u0027I have my sources.\u0027 Turchin shrugged.For the moment at least Trask let that one slide and said, \u0027No, it wasn\u0027t Mikhail Suvorov - but it was as a direct result of his \"invasion\" of Sunside/Starside. That was what brought it about\u0027 And he quickly told the Russian Premier everything that had happened, including the fact that three Great Vampires were now at large in the world, and that he and E-Branch were trying to hunt them down.\u0027And that is why you\u0027re here?\u0027\u0027We believe that one of them is here in Australia, yes.\u0027And Turchin said, \u0027Ah! Then that would explain why initially you were on the other side of the continent, and not here in Brisbane. And so it\u0027s a pure coincidence that the trail has led you here: you think that he - your \"man,\" shall we say? - is close by.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s not far away, that\u0027s for sure,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027And now I have a question for you.\u0027\u0027Go ahead.\u0027\u0027If you knew we were in the west, in the Gibson Desert on the other side of Australia, why did you ask my headquarters if I\u0027d be attending the conference? Also, how did you know we were in Western Australia in the first place?\u0027\u0027That\u0027s two questions,\u0027 Turchin smiled.Trask nodded. \u0027Yes, but please don\u0027t spoil things by lying to me on either one of them.\u0027\u0027To you?\u0027 Turchin raised that eyebrow again. \u0027Do you think that\u0027s likely, Ben?\u0027\u0027No, because I know it isn\u0027t possible,\u0027 said the other. \u0027I was reminding you of that fact, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t need reminding,\u0027 the Premier told him. \u0027And I say again, I\u0027m not here to lie to you but to ask for your help. And now you ask how I know so much. Very well, then listen:\n \u0027When our Russian equivalent of your E-Branch failed - and failed so very spectacularly at the hands of Harry Keogh - then ESP as a weapon was largely discredited and the Russian organization disbanded. Or at least it was \"officially\" disbanded. For our military commanders, down-to-earth fellows who would rather put their faith in conventional spying techniques, wanted nothing more to do with it. Which made it an ideal tool for a Premier who - \u0027\n \u0027 - Who was pretty much powerless but desperate to keep an eye on things,\u0027 Trask finished it for him. \u0027You yourself, Gustav. You are now in charge of the Opposition!\u0027\u0027Covertly, yes. What\u0027s left of it,\u0027 Turchin nodded.\u0027And you\u0027ve been using your mind-spies to watch us?\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t look so hurt, Ben! Haven\u0027t you been watching me and mine?\u0027Trask thought about it and grinned ... and was serious again in a moment. \u0027But you still haven\u0027t told me why you asked my HQ if I was attending the conference?\u0027The other smiled. \u0027It was my way of telling you that I was attending, without spelling out a request to meet with you.\u0027\u0027Still sharp as a tack,\u0027 Trask said. And: \u0027Okay. So, as you now know, I too have a problem ... shit, I mean the whole world has a problem! Three of them, and big ones. But yours has to be urgent, too, and probably personal, else you wouldn\u0027t be taking chances talking to me. Obviously we need to make a deal, and we will, a mutually beneficial arrangement. But I can\u0027t do or promise anything until I know what your problem is.\u0027\u0027Urgent, yes, definitely,\u0027 said Turchin. \u0027But personal? Not any longer, not after what you have told me. For it seems to me our problems mesh, becoming one and the same. Very well, I know one of yours - or ours, as it now appears - and the worst of them at that: that there are vampires in our world. But somehow I think there\u0027s a lot more than that to it. Am I right?\u0027\u0027A tangled skein, yes,\u0027 Trask nodded. \u0027But synchronous, all coming together at the same time. And meanwhile our time is flying. So okay, you first Just what is your problem, comrade?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-26.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
