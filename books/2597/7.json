{"id":97206,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"More Of Jake\u0027s Story Ben Trask, lan Goodly, and the old Lidesci were first away from the gutted, smouldering remains of the vampire enclave; Liz and Jake followed on behind Trask\u0027s commandeered transport in their own vehicle. They would be taking it easy, so it shouldn\u0027t be a problem that they\u0027d lost the windshield. If they kept well back from Trask, the dust thrown up by his Land Rover wouldn\u0027t bother them. And the cool night air would be a definite bonus. Just as they rolled onto the ramp cut in the steep face of the bluff, Jake slowed almost to a halt and looked back.Apart from the smoke there was very little to show for the earlier activity. Several members of the team, dressed in fresh combat clothing but no longer armed or gas-masked, were hammering sharp signposts into the stony earth. One such post carried a legend only just visible in moon- and starlight:HEALTH HAZARD! TOXIC WASTE! KEEP OUT!E-Branch took no chances.\u0027What next?\u0027 Jake jerked his head to indicate the scene of recent devastation. \u0027For this place, I mean?\u0027Liz shrugged. \u0027The mine\u0027s sealed, there are no life signs. Tomorrow the sun will come up and scorch the bluff clean.Maybe they\u0027ll bulldoze the surface and dynamite the ramp,eventually. But there\u0027s no real hurry now. The main man wasBruce Trennier, as yet only a lieutenant but a would-be Lord.If he had got away ...\u0027 Again her shrug. \u0027Tomorrow they\u0027d beback to tracking him down again. As it is, the operation was acomplete success.\u0027\u0027And this was the first time you\u0027ve seen this kind of action?\u0027Jake slipped the \u0027Rover into third, let gravity draw them down thedusty ramp. \u0027How come you know so much more about this stuffthan I do?\u0027Liz tossed her hair back. \u0027I\u0027ve had a little time to studywhat they do - the Branch, I mean - and I\u0027m \"aware\" of myown talent, which makes their talents so much more acceptable.Once you begin to realize that all the weird stuff is real, it\u0027s notso difficult to believe the weirdest stuff of all.\u0027But Jake only wondered, And that\u0027s a good, thing - to actually believe inall ofthisPEut still it was hard to deny his own five senses. Assumingthey were his own, of course.Down on the level, he turned onto the old road. A quarter-mile ahead, Trask\u0027s tail lights glowed red. \u0027I still can\u0027t accept that we were simply thrown in at the deep end,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027It was a test, as Trask told you,\u0027 Liz answered. \u0027I guess he knew that once we\u0027d actually experienced it, gone up against the plague itself... well, that we really would accept it.\u0027 \u0027So why don\u0027t I?\u0027 Jake wanted to know. For a while she was silent, letting the wind blow her hair back, breathing the night air. Then she said, \u0027Jake, about your story tonight, in the Ops Room. There are terrible experiences, and there are terrible experiences. There are monsters and monsters, and I don\u0027t know which ones are the worst. But your life has been one of extremes. Maybe if mine had been messed with as much as yours, I\u0027d start to wonder what was real, too. But this talent of yours, that\u0027s really something else. I mean, what you did tonight was - \u0027 \u0027 - Wasn\u0027t me!\u0027 he said sharply, cutting her off. And with a shake of his head: \u0027I can\u0027t explain it any better than that.\u0027 \u0027Try,\u0027 she said. \u0027If we are to be partners, surely you can try? Look, this isn\u0027t something I suggest lightly - the Branch has its own internal code of conduct for espers, telepaths, empaths and such - but if you\u0027ll just let your thoughts flow free, I\u0027ll...\u0027\u0027You\u0027ll what?\u0027 he looked at her. \u0027Read my mind? See if I\u0027m as messed up as you suspect? Well, I probably am. Probably have been ever since ... since Natasha died. The way she died.\u0027 Then he sighed and relaxed a little. \u0027On the other hand you could be right. My life las been a mess, and fate seems bent on screwing me around more than my fair share. So is it any wonder I have a problem sorting out what\u0027s real from what\u0027s fantasy? And as for E-Branch,\u0027 Jake shook his head wonderingly. \u0027Gadgets and ghosts - yeah!\u0027\u0027And they want you for one of their gadgets/ she said.\u0027Huh!\u0027 he answered. \u0027Maybe one of their ghosts, if things had gone wrong tonight!\u0027\u0027You\u0027ve changed the subject,\u0027 Liz accused. \u0027Look, back in the Ops Room you started to tell your story. A good start, but you didn\u0027t nearly tell it all. Now me, I\u0027m a hell of a listener. And right now, right here, there\u0027s just the two of us.\u0027\u0027Oh really?\u0027 he said. \u0027A good listener - and bloodthirsty with it? Like one of those things we destroyed tonight?\u0027\u0027That\u0027s not fair,\u0027 Liz answered. \u0027And that\u0027s not the part that interests me.\u0027 She gave a little shudder. \u0027I mean, I know you killed all of those men - \u0027\u0027No, not all of them,\u0027 Jake said, coldly. \u0027Castellano and one other, they\u0027ve still got it coming.\u0027\u0027 - And that your methods were ... extreme, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about. I\u0027ve heard Ben Trask going on about the way you use what he calls the Mobius Route. That\u0027s your talent, right, Jake? It\u0027s how you moved us to safety back at the lair.\u0027He nodded, growled, \u0027And that\u0027s what I keep trying to tell you. It\u0027s not mine! It\u0027s like - I don\u0027t know - somebody else? Someone who gets into my head, anyway. Someone who\u0027s living in there like a bloody squatter. Trask keeps mentioning this Harry Keogh. Well who is this Keogh? Some kind of telepath? And if so why is he so damned keen to mess with my mind? Why not pick on someone else, someone more receptive. No, I can\u0027t see it. Maybe it\u0027s a part of me that this me - I mean the real me - doesn\u0027t recognize. Like I\u0027m a ... a split personality or something? God, maybe I really am crazy!\u0027 He banged on the steering wheel with the flats of his hands, stamped his feet and set the Landrover to swerving.Liz gave him time to cool down, then said, \u0027Jake, how can I get through to you? This isn\u0027t just for me, nor even for Ben Trask or his people; it\u0027s mainly for you. I wish you\u0027d tell me about it: how you escaped from jail and all, and ended up with E-Branch. I know it happened, but not how it happened. So what do you say? Will you tell me?\u0027And he knew she wouldn\u0027t let it go until he did ...\u0027I got sloppy,\u0027 Jake began. \u0027When I killed the third and last but one of Castellano\u0027s men - of the men who had been present at the villa that night - it was a sloppy job. A case of familiarity breeding contempt?\u0027 Glancing at Liz, he shook his head. \u0027I would really hate to think so; hate to admit that I was getting used to it. But who can say? Maybe I was at that. \u0027Anyway, he was an Italian and I killed him in Italy. And I got caught there, too. Maybe they were waiting for me. After all, I had been working down a list, like a serial killer, you know? Of course, Castellano must by then have made the connection - must have figured out that this wasn\u0027t just another gang war - and it\u0027s possible he had tipped off the authorities, the police. When I thought it out, it was even possible he\u0027d sent that last victim out of France to put distance between himself and me! If so, then I\u0027d actually managed to get to the bastard - I\u0027d worried him considerably - which felt very good. But in any case: \u0027I was tried and convicted in Italy, and there was no hope of extradition. Having dual nationality - English and French - only made the legal side of it even more tangled, complicated, hopeless. And to put the cap on it, current European law made it imperative that I was tried \"in the country where the crime was committed for any serious offence against nationals of the said country\". Well, you can\u0027t get any more serious than murder, which was their term for what I\u0027d done, even if I called it an act of justice! And finally, if found guilty - which of course I was - I would have to serve out my time in that same country. \u0027That\u0027s why I think it was Castellano who set the trap for me, and baited it with his own man. Castellano\u0027s a Sicilian, or an Italian if you like. And it\u0027s like Trask says: the gangs are highly organized now - computerized, integrated and all - and as always they have their fingers in every pie.\u0027So, why do you reckon this bastard thug would want me in an Italian jail? Obviously, it was one of those pies in which he had a finger! Jake Cutter was a dead man. If not immediately, then soon.\u0027But to me the hell of it was I\u0027d never been able to get a sniff of Castellano himself. The villa in Marseille was always guarded to the hilt, and if he\u0027d ever left it... well, I certainly didn\u0027t know about it. How could I? I still didn\u0027t - still don\u0027t - even know what he looks like. This is one secretive son of a bitch! But I will find him one day, and when I do ...\u0027\u0027But not while you\u0027re working for E-Branch,\u0027 Liz broke in. \u0027The one thing you mustn\u0027t do is compromise the Branch. They\u0027re your protection, Jake. And you\u0027ve got to remember: Trask is the only thing standing between you and a return visit to that cell in ... where?\u0027\u0027In Torino,\u0027 Jake answered. \u0027Turin, where they\u0027re alleged to have found The Shroud, and where I was being fitted for one! I tell you, Liz, there were some hard men in that jail. It took me maybe - oh, twenty-four hours? - to figure out that I wasn\u0027t getting out in one piece. The looks, the nudges, the winks. But what I said earlier about the size of my... er, you know what, that wasn\u0027t true; could have been but wasn\u0027t. No one came sidling up to me offering their protection for a little buggery on the side; I guess because the word had gone out that I couldn\u0027t be protected, and that anyone who tried it might well need some protection himself.\u0027And there were a couple of narrow squeaks. Knife fights I wasn\u0027t involved in to start with, that I somehow got involved in. And once in the prison hospital - I was in for abdominal bruising and a suspected fractured rib... yes, another one - when someone tried to inject me with a hypodermic full of human shit...\u0027Anyway, I\u0027d been in there for eleven weeks when this guy - just a guy, no one sinister, I thought, but someone who probably pitied me - got me on my own and told me that it was coming. And when it was coming. I had a week to live, he said. And no good going to the prison staff; they were in on it, and the governor was a man who knew which side his bread was buttered.\u0027Then a funny thing. This same little fellow said he was working in the machine shop. He gave me a rough key - just a strip of metal, really - showed me how to make an impression of the lock on my cell. This was an old, old prison, Liz. Not like the home from home you\u0027ll find in a lot of modern English jails. Anyway: \"You take the impression,\" he said, \"and I make finish the key.\"\u0027So what was in it for him? He already had his own key, he said, and a plan. But he couldn\u0027t do it on his own. And he figured I might be just desperate enough to go along with him. Oh, he supposed I had seen those old prison movies - of the double double-cross kind? - but hey, it was his life, too, wasn\u0027t it? Did I think he was suicidal or something? So maybe he was, but he\u0027d got one thing right at least: I was desperate enough.\u0027Okay, my reasons for wanting to escape were plain enough: I wanted Castellano dead, and couldn\u0027t do it from inside where my own life seemed destined to be a pretty short one. But what about my new-found friend\u0027s reasons? \u0027Apparently it was for a woman. \"A dear old friend of mine, he fucking my Maria,\" he told me, grinning emotionlessly. \"The last man who did that, he dead ... is why I in here. This time I going fuck loth of them, Maria, too. After that I not care.\u0027\u0027Funny thing is, I understood him well enough. Just didn\u0027t realize how far he\u0027d go to clear this little matter up, that\u0027s all.\u0027Came the night. We got out into the exercise yard way too easy and I felt it was all wrong, all fixed. But it was far too late to go back and lock myself in ... and what if I was simply being paranoid? I mean, this was my one last chance. It was his one chance, too, this bald, scrawny little Italian murderer who made the keys.\u0027His plan was simple: he had a length of chain he\u0027d welded hooks to. Between us and freedom there was a twelve-foot wall, barbed-wired at the top. He was a little guy; he would get on my back, use his chain like a grapnel to grab at the barbed wire. He\u0027d tried it in the workshops and it worked. By God, it also worked out there in the exercise yard!\u0027So Paolo scrambled from my shoulders up the chain, took a prison blanket from around his neck and tossed it over the barbed wire, which his weight had pulled flat. He balanced himself up there with a leg over the wall, stretched out a hand for me. But when I was on the chain and as I was reaching for his hand ... he withdrew it! And I saw his eyes, looking beyond me into the night. I glanced over my shoulder, saw them:\u0027Prison guards, armed and taking aim! I looked up at Paolo, his face staring down at me. \"I sorry, Jake,\" he shrugged. \"But they promise me ...\" And then, cutting him short, the crack! of a rifle shot...\u0027Jake paused, swerving to avoid a pothole, and Liz took the opportunity to ask:\u0027Is that when it happened? When you ... moved?\u0027He shook his head. \u0027Not quite. But Liz, you know how they say you don\u0027t hear the one that kills you? Well, it\u0027s true. I know because I heard the bark of that first shot, but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. Paolo, on the other hand ... his blood splashed me as his right eye turned black. Then he was falling, and taking me with him. It was only a few feet, but with him on top of me I hit the ground like a ton of bricks. Just as well because there was more shooting, shouting, the flash of bullets sparking where they spanged off the wall.\u0027That\u0027s when it happened. But exactly what happened ... I don\u0027t know to this day. And something very weird: if you don\u0027t hear the one that kills you, how about seeing it? I mean, did you ever hear of anyone actually seeing a bullet in flight? Of course not; and please, no cracks about phoney stage magicians who catch them in their teeth!\u0027Yet I saw ... something. A flash of fire from a ricochet? It could be. But it didn\u0027t look like fire. It was tiny, bright, and it came came right at me - at my head - and couldn\u0027t have missed me. If it had been a bullet, then I was dead ...\u0027... But it wasn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t have been, and I only thought I was dead.\u0027Liz nodded, her mouth suddenly dry. Because for a moment, as Jake had finished speaking, she had received a vivid impression of something alien to all science and knowledge, something from outside. She\u0027d \u0027seen\u0027 his meeting - his confrontation? - with what he\u0027d described. A transitory thing, it came and went, like a bright flash of fire reflecting from the surface of his mind ... or still burning in his mind?\u0027That was when you did it/ she said hoarsely, and cleared her throat. \u0027That was when you moved, took the Mobius Route.\u0027\u0027There was an indescribable darkness,\u0027 Jake told her. \u0027More than darkness, a nothingness. It was death; I mean I thought it was death, for what else could it be? But I was drawn into and through it, towards a point of light.\u0027\u0027A typical out-of-body experience,\u0027 Liz said. \u0027A near-death experience, as certain survivors are supposed to have known it. The Light, which you refused to enter.\u0027 But Jake shook his head. \u0027Refused nothing; I had no choice; I was dragged right in! But suddenly there was gravity, weight, and I\u0027d been struggling with the darkness - whatever it was - and the wrong way up. I emerged upside down, fell, smacked my head against something ... a desk, as it turned out. So you see, the second bout of darkness wasn\u0027t nearly so drastic. I was merely unconscious. Or about to be. \u0027Anyway, even as I passed out I remember there were alarms going off, someone hammering at a door, a voice shouting. Then nothing more.\u0027\u0027Not until you came to at E-Branch HQ in London,\u0027 Liz said. \u0027That\u0027s where your talent had taken you: to Harry\u0027s Room... sanctuary.\u0027He shook his head in denial. \u0027Not my talent. Oh, someone\u0027s, as it appears. Harry\u0027s, maybe? But not mine, Liz, not mine ...\u0027The radio crackled into life, Trask\u0027s voice saying: \u0027All call-signs, but especially Hunter One, this is Zero One. Maybe five miles up the road from here, the chuck wagon. Base camp, where we eat, drink and debrief. Those with beds in the ops vehicle, use \u0027em. Tentage for the rest. Or should you prefer to stretch your legs you can put up your own tents and bivouacs. And Hunter One, I\u0027ll be wanting to speak to you. All acknowledge.\u0027\u0027Hunter One, roger,\u0027 Liz answered into her handset. And in strict numerical order, coming through the hiss and crackle of static:\u0027Hunter Two, roger.\u0027\u0027Hunter Three, roger,\u0027 and so on.Jake shifted his position in the driver\u0027s seat, craned his neck, and glanced back along the dark, winding road through the ancient river valley. Back there, stretched well out, a handful of headlights made a lantern string in the night. And from dragonfly shapes on high came the steady, near-distant whup! whup! whup! of powerful blades slicing the air, the occasional flickering beam of a searchlight.\u0027Five miles,\u0027 Liz said. \u0027Maybe seven or eight minutes. Will you tell me the rest of it while we still have time?\u0027 \u0027The rest of it?\u0027 Jake was reluctant again. \u0027You still need convincing I\u0027m crazy?\u0027\u0027You\u0027re not crazy/ she said. \u0027Just troubled. Come on, Jake You ran away, escaped again, this time from E-Branch. What happened? How did that come about? Was it any different?\u0027He sighed and said, \u0027Once you stick your claws in you just don\u0027t let go, do you?\u0027\u0027Or could it be that I\u0027m simply fascinated?\u0027 she answered. And quickly added, \u0027Er, with your story, I mean.\u0027(Huh!\u0027]ake snorted, but he also angled his face a little, turned it away from her. Liz could have sworn that he was grinning and didn\u0027t want her to see. But that was a good thing.\u0027Okay,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m fascinated, period. So now will you tell me the rest?\u0027\u0027So you can report it to Trask, right? Well, I\u0027ve got news for you: your boss - our boss - has already had this from me, oh, at least a dozen times. Don\u0027t you get it? I can\u0027t tell you what isn\u0027t there.\u0027\u0027Then tell me what is,\u0027 she said.Again Jake\u0027s sigh, before he succumbed to the inevitable. But then: \u0027Okay, this is how it was ...\u0027\u0027When - or rather, where - I woke up, everyone was speaking English. I don\u0027t know what I thought. Oh, several things. A jangle of things, rattling around in my skull. Maybe, following injuries sustained in the failed jailbreak, I\u0027d been extradited back to England after all. But what injuries? While it\u0027s true I was flat on my back with a sheet and blanket thrown over me, I didn\u0027t feel in any way injured. Also, I was in no way conscious of the passage of any real time; it felt like snap!... I had been in Turin and now was here. So logically, while this wasn\u0027t the prison, it had to be a place somewhere in or near Turin. As for the people, Trask and Co - they weren\u0027t jailers or even physicians. So if this place was a hospital, well, it wasn\u0027t like any I\u0027d ever heard of! And they kept asking me a lot of nonsense questions, the silliest with regard to my identity. \"Who are you?\" they all wanted to know. Huh! Who were they kidding? If they didn\u0027t know who I was, who would? Who was P But the question I kept asking myself was who the hell were they?\u0027Then a real doctor arrived who checked me over, giving me a thorough physical before I was allowed up on my feet. I supposed I was lucky that I hadn\u0027t at first been able to talk even if I\u0027d wanted to. The whole experience had struck me dumb. But then it dawned on me that they really didn\u0027t have any idea who I was. So why should I tell them?\u0027I kept quiet, told them nothing, didn\u0027t even speak.\u0027But Trask... he knew I wasn\u0027t on the level. Right from square one I could see that he was more than curious, positively suspicious about me. I suppose he had every right to be; I know now that the place I - er, emerged into? \"Harry\u0027s Room?\" - is highly significant to the Branch. More than that, though, Trask knew I was lying. Even without me saying a word, he knew I wasn\u0027t telling the truth, knew I was hiding something.\u0027Well, of course I was! Wherever I\u0027d \"escaped\" to, anywhere had to be better than the vermin-infested slaughterhouse in Turin that I\u0027d escaped from! And yes, I had already made up my mind that as soon as this weird crowd gave me room to breathe, I\u0027d likewise be escaping from here - wherever \"here\" was!\u0027Finally, instead of asking me stuff and getting no satisfactory answers, no answers at all, Trask said, \"You\u0027re in the headquarters of a branch of government, a very off-limits establishment, Mr ... whoever you are. You shouldn\u0027t be here, and the penalty for trespass is a high one. But I\u0027m really interested in you, in how you arrived - especially where you arrived - and I\u0027d very much like you to start explaining. If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll have to assume you\u0027re a common criminal and deal with you on that basis ...\"\u0027But then he got a certain look in his eye, like he\u0027d suddenly stumbled across the truth - maybe a truth even I didn\u0027t know - and quickly went on, \"Or maybe an uncommon criminal? In which case we might just be getting somewhere.\" \u0027Some of Trask\u0027s people had guns and there didn\u0027t seem too much point in trying to break out of there, not at present. So I just had to keep playing along.\u0027Finally, I was escorted to the HQ Ops Room.\u0027 Jake glanced at Liz. \u0027Do you know the place? I take it you\u0027ve been there.\u0027He waited for her nod, the one word that summed up her own feelings the first time she\u0027d seen the Ops Room. \u0027Awesome ...\u0027\u0027Yes, awesome,\u0027 he agreed. \u0027I don\u0027t know about ghosts, but E-Branch certainly has the gadgets! Anyway, as soon as we entered - before anyone could stop me - I stepped to a window and yanked the blinds. It was night but there were plenty of street lights. There could be no mistaking where I was; the very sight of it set me reeling. That skyline, that city. Impossible, but it was Westminster! London! The centre of bloody London!\u0027And grabbing me, looking at me with those all-seeing eyes of his, Trask said, \"Surprise, surprise! So where did you think you were, Mr Nobody?\" \u0027By then a lot of other people had arrived. They\u0027d got the place up and running. It was the middle of the night after all, and my being there was just as big - maybe a bigger - shock to them as it was to me. But they must have a good emergency call-in; the place was fully operative in no time at all. And every man-jack and woman of them wide-eyed, whispering, curious ... maybe even awestruck? But why? What was so special about me? \u0027Anyway, things were happening at a rapid pace. \u0027 \"Prison clothing,\" Trask said. \"At a guess, continental. Very well, get fingerprints, mug shots - do it now. Then get a link to Interpol, see if we can get a match. But let\u0027s not get carried away, not yet. Let\u0027s not think the unthinkable, or the incredible? Check the security system and see if it recorded a physical break-in. And let\u0027s have a check on all doors and windows, and the elevator. Then get me the Duty Officer. Didn\u0027t I hear him saying something about not being able to get into Harry\u0027s Room because the door was locked? Now why would Mr Nobody here first break in, then lock himself in? And how could he do it anyway without a key ... assuming he broke in at all?\" \u0027Trask said all of these things, if not in the same words. And he probably said a lot more that I can\u0027t remember before he finished up with: \"Answers, people, I want all the answers. And I do mean tonight...\" \u0027I had been fingerprinted and photographed by the time two new agents entered the Ops Room. Trask greeted them with, \"Current Affairs, and Tomorrow\u0027s Affairs. And not before time, you two.\"\u0027Liz nodded, said, \u0027Millicent Cleary and lan Goodly. Millicent is a telepath, but she\u0027s also an expert in current affairs. She has that kind of memory. You want to know what\u0027s gone down in the last ten years, ask Millicent. And lan Goodly - \u0027\u0027 - A precog,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027Yes, I know that now. But then - I couldn\u0027t make head nor tail of their conversation. Trask wanted to know why Goodly hadn\u0027t \"seen\" anything, and he asked the woman if she was \"getting\" anything. That was the way he talked to everyone around him. It all seemed pretty esoteric to me!\u0027\u0027Espers have an almost different tongue,\u0027 Liz answered. \u0027It takes some getting used to.\u0027\u0027Anyway, lan Goodly was at a loss to explain his lapse. And the woman, Millicent Cleary? She stared hard at me, frowned and said there was a lot of confusion. Damn, right there was!\u0027\u0027The confusion was in you,\u0027 Liz told him.\u0027Looking back on it, you\u0027re dead right,\u0027 he said. And after a moment:\u0027By then all the wall screens were up and working - people processing my pictures and feeding them into machines, computer keyboards tap, tap, tapping away - but I was a little less the centre of attention. I saw my chance, snatched a gun from a man who was momentarily distracted, grabbed hold of Goodly. I had the gun to his neck, his arm up behind his back.\u0027For a moment I thought Trask and the others might rush me. But then Goodly said, \"It\u0027s okay, Ben. Everything will be fine. Just let us go, and be sure we\u0027ll be back.\"\u0027I told him, \"Do you want to bet?\" But now ... I\u0027m glad he didn\u0027t! I\u0027ll cut a long story short. I got Goodly out of there and into the elevator. He used his card without argument. Then we were out in the street. Which was when he turned the tables on me. How? Well, I suppose he saw the future, knew I wouldn\u0027t shoot him. Or maybe he saw that I couldn\u0027t?\u0027Anyway, he just twisted round to face me, grabbed the gun and started wrestling me for it. I was so surprised... I just let go of the thing! And the fact was I couldn\u0027t have shot him anyway, not an innocent man. But I couldn\u0027t say the same thing for him, now could I? And there he was, crouching down, aiming the gun at me!\u0027The vehicle was nosing down a slight decline. As they came round a shallow bend, Jake saw campfires and started to brake. Then a man stepped out onto the crumbling tarmac and made signals, directing them into a makeshift roadside parking area. As they slowed to a standstill, Liz sat still, said, \u0027Finish it.\u0027 And Jake thought, Why not? Except there\u0027s nothing left to tell! Or if there was he couldn\u0027t possibly explain it. But he could at least try. \u0027It\u0027s already finished/ he said. \u0027When I thought Goodly was going to shoot me, I made a dive for cover. I mean, I knew I was diving to safety... but that wasn\u0027t possible. How could there be any cover, any safety, out there in the middle of the street?\u0027 \u0027There couldn\u0027t be,\u0027 she said.\u0027No,\u0027 Jake answered huskily, pale in the flickering firelight. \u0027There couldn\u0027t be. Not out theje in the street. But it wasn\u0027t me who reacted to the perceived danger, Liz. Not me but someone in my head. Someone or something that reckoned I would be safer ... that I\u0027d be safer - \u0027But Liz, reading it clearly in his mind, came to his aid and finished it for him:\u0027 - That you\u0027d be much safer back in Harry\u0027s Room, yes/ she sighed. He shook his head, frowned and said, \u0027But safe from what? From Goodly, who didn\u0027t intend to harm me in the first place?\u0027 She made no answer but thought: No, just safe - period. Maybe lan Goodly\u0027s gun hadn\u0027t triggered the thing at all; maybe it simply hadn\u0027t wanted Jake out there on his own, on the streets. For whatever it was, this thing had been new to him at that time. Still very strong in him - and having only recently found him - it hadn\u0027t been about to let him escape. Not without first exploring him, and not until Jake had explored its possibilities, its potential. Such were Liz\u0027s thoughts. But bringing them back to earth: \u0027We\u0027re there/ said Jake. \u0027So are we going to sit here all night? Me, I\u0027d like a mug of coffee and a bite to eat...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-7.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
