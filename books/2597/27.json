{"id":97226,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Dilemmas, Dreams, And Deadspeak\u0027My problems, plural, are not so simple,\u0027 said Gustav Turchin. \u0027Suvorov told a handful of his military cronies that he was onto something big,\u0027 also that he\u0027d probably be incommunicado for a while, but in the event he was gone for too long they should come to me for answers. Well, some eighteen months ago they started to ask questions, not too many, for with Suvorov out of the way they had been playing their own hands. These are people with small armies of their own, funded by the drugs trade, I suspect, for they certainly can\u0027t be getting it through official channels. Why not? Because the bank is broke.\u0027 Anyway, sooner or later they\u0027ll become more insistent, and I\u0027m the one whom they\u0027ll squeeze for information. Obviously I don\u0027t want to tell them anything about Perchorsk, so what can I tell them?\u0027Next problem: \u0027The Perchorsk complex is still dry, the Gate stands open, and the Wamphyri are back in Sunside/Starside. Which means, of course, that the Gate has to be closed. But how, since Mikhail Suvorov\u0027s gang of criminal \"engineers\" are still in control up there, standing guard on the place and waiting for his return? Which brings up another question: how long before some of them decide to follow him through the Gate? \u0027Well, despite that the complex is isolated, remote, still I can\u0027t attack it. Even if I had the military muscle I wouldn\u0027t dare use it for fear of attracting the rest of Suvorov\u0027s \"colleagues\" to Perchorsk. There you have it: it\u0027s a vicious circle, and frankly I can\u0027t see any easy way to break out of it.\u0027 \u0027Me neither,\u0027 said Trask, frowning. \u0027But that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s hopeless. In E-Branch I have a good many first-class problem-solvers, and I promise I\u0027ll do what I can. But first let me get it straight. No one else knows about Sunside/Starside\u0027s mineral riches?\u0027\u0027Now that Suvorov is dead, no. Not that I\u0027m aware of.\u0027\u0027And there are no documents to lead anyone in that direction?\u0027\u0027None that I know of.\u0027 Turchin shook his head.\u0027Then what it boils down to is this: you\u0027ve got to find a way to tell Mikhail Suvorov\u0027s cronies he\u0027s dead, while simultaneously ensuring that they don\u0027t go looking for him.\u0027\u0027What?\u0027 Turchin was at once alarmed. \u0027And without telling them how or where he died, surely - that is, if you would save Nathan\u0027s world from uttermost destruction! For if you think for a moment they wouldn\u0027t go searching for Suvorov, you\u0027re wrong. They would. And they would see what they would see, and having seen it... then they would turn a whole world into a nuclear, chemical, and biological wasteland!\u0027\u0027Zfthey managed to get back here to tell about it,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027But in any case you\u0027re right: eventually we\u0027ll have to get into Perchorsk and close the Gate, for good this time.\u0027\u0027Precisely. Until which time the problems remain ...\u0027Trask was silent for a moment, then said, \u0027As for the one we\u0027ve just formulated, how to get into Perchorsk and close the Gate: I may soon have the answer to that one at least. But not right now. It\u0027s something I\u0027m working on.\u0027\u0027Harry Keogh could have done it,\u0027 said Turchin knowingly, perhaps wistfully.\u0027Harry\u0027s dead,\u0027 said Trask.\u0027But Nathan isn\u0027t/ said Turchin. \u0027And he owes me.\u0027Trask shook his head. \u0027No, Nathan can\u0027t help us. Not right now. He has problems of his own, in Sunside/Starside. And there isn\u0027t any way we can contact him.\u0027But didn\u0027t you say you were working on something?\u0027\u0027Something, someone, yes. Don\u0027t ask me any more about it.\u0027Turchin nodded. \u0027I see ...\u0027\u0027But don\u0027t lose hope,\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027Like I said, we\u0027ll do what we can. Meanwhile you\u0027ll have to sit tight, play dumb.\u0027\u0027Play dumb?\u0027 Turchin snorted. \u0027I may be the Premier, but I can\u0027t hold these people off forever! Suvorov and a good many men, scientist and soldier both, have gone missing and they believe I have the answers. And when I won\u0027t supply them, then they\u0027ll think I\u0027m involved.\u0027\u0027Then keep out of their way for as long as you can.\u0027\u0027I intend to,\u0027 said Turchin. \u0027That is the other reason I\u0027m here in Brisbane. Because it keeps me out of Russia. And that\u0027s why those \"friends\" of mine in the other car, those - \u0027\u0027Those goons?\u0027\u0027 - Why those goons are here, yes.\u0027 Turchin tried to smile but it was a futile effort. \u0027To make sure I\u0027ll find my way back home again. Hub!\u0027\u0027You could seek political asylum.\u0027\u0027Which might solve my problem, but it wouldn\u0027t solve ours, yours, Russia\u0027s, or the world\u0027s.\u0027\u0027So what will you do?\u0027\u0027These conferences look like they\u0027ll go on forever. Certainly for the rest of this year. Here, and in London, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, Calcutta, you name it. I shall attend them all, one after the other if that\u0027s at all feasible. And of course I shall sweat and worry, and wait for you to come up with an answer.\u0027\u0027And at the same time do something for me,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027Ah, yes! Your problems/ said Turchin. \u0027I had almost forgotten that this isn\u0027t a one-sided affair. So then, what can I do for you?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all part of the same problem,\u0027 Trask told him. \u0027Remember that and it might give you an incentive. First, call off your mindspies. If we\u0027re to work together - or at least on the same wavelength - you don\u0027t need to be watching me. But on the other hand I do need them to be watching out for me. Or rather, for vampires. But there\u0027s more than one kind of bloodsucker involved here. You mentioned the illicit drugs trade. It\u0027s no big secret how the so-called Russian Mafia are flushing your people and your country down the toilet. But in another way, a different way, they\u0027re also connected with our problem in general. So here\u0027s what I want you to do ...\u0027 And he quickly explained what he wanted: information from Turchin\u0027s side on the Moscow Mafia\u0027s connection with Marseille, with specific reference to Luigi Castellano\u0027s organization and its operation in the northern Mediterranean. And: \u0027This man Castellano is of particular interest to us,\u0027 he finished up. \u0027He\u0027s a dark horse indeed. My people in the Branch haven\u0027t so far been able to pin him down, and Interpol has next to nothing on him. I mean, it\u0027s not unusual for a drugs boss to keep a low profile, but this one\u0027s near-invisible. And frankly, I want his backside in a sling.\u0027 Turchin looked doubtful. \u0027But doesn\u0027t this smack of common or garden police work? How does it fit into the big picture?\u0027\u0027I\u0027m trying to help someone who may soon be in a very good position to help me - or us,\u0027 Trask answered. \u0027If I scratch his back, with a bit of luck he\u0027ll scratch ours.\u0027And Turchin nodded. Til see what I can do. Is there anything else?\u0027\u0027You can try to find out just exactly what we\u0027ll be going up against if or when we do try to take Perchorsk,\u0027 Trask said. The Russian Premier looked at him; indeed, his dark, glinting eyes bored into him as he inquired, \u0027With a British force, do you mean? In which case you might require a route of access. Not to mention one of egress, an escape route.\u0027 \u0027Good idea,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027You can look into that, too, by all means. And you can think how to give us cover in the event of political flak, that is if we were seen to be involved. But at the moment I don\u0027t see it as a problem. It\u0027s like you said: Perchorsk is remote, isolated.\u0027\u0027Oh? And you can come and go into foreign lands and alien places at will, can you?\u0027 And now Turchin\u0027s gaze was even more intense.But Trask only said, \u0027We\u0027ve talked enough, and our time\u0027s up.\u0027 Then he switched on the intercom and said: \u0027Mr Smith, the hotel, if you please.\u0027In a little while, Turchin said. \u0027Well, it seems our business is done for now. But if that\u0027s all you want, and if things eventually work out, it would appear I get the best of the bargain.\u0027Trask looked at him and shook his head. \u0027I understand what you\u0027re saying, Gustav, but I think it\u0027s a very narrow viewpoint. The way I see it, the whole world gets the best of the bargain. Which is to say, we all come out of it alive ... and as men.\u0027Turchin shrugged and answered, \u0027Yes, yes, of course you\u0027re right. Still, on a moment-to-moment basis, one\u0027s own skin is oddly precious.\u0027But Trask only said, \u0027How about one\u0027s soul?\u0027And a little later, while Turchin thought about that - if he thought about it - the limo arrived at his hotel...... And Trask was long gone before the second limo drew up where Turchin stamped \u0027angrily\u0027 to and fro, waiting for his minders.Tfw^He grunted as they got out of the car. \u0027Couldn\u0027t at least one of you have made an effort to stay with me?\u0027\u0027But Premier - \u0027 the senior man began to protest.\u0027No buts.\" Turchin snapped. \u0027I shall report your inefficiency back in Moscow. And I\u0027ll also be making a strong complaint here.\u0027\u0027A complaint?\u0027 The other\u0027s jaw dropped. \u0027Of course, fool! No, no, not about you, but my driver and this bloody conference official, this Mr, er - \u0027 \u0027Smith?\u0027\u0027Indeed, yes!\u0027\u0027Both the driver and the official were Smiths?\u0027 \u0027Eh? Yes, I know that, you idiot! Please try not to inform me of what I already know. But, damn! You\u0027d think that at least one of them would know the way to the hotel, wouldn\u0027t you ... ?\u0027By the time the precog lan Goodly picked up the locator David Chung from Brisbane\u0027s international airport, Trask was in bed asleep. But he had left a message not to be disturbed, with a note that said:David, welcome - But I\u0027m afraid you will have to start \u0027swarming\u0027 in the morning. Right now we\u0027re all badly in need of a few hours\u0027 sleep. I imagine it must be pretty much the same for you, what with jetlag and all.lan: make sure the D.O. knows to wake me if anything important comes in during the night. Other than that, give me a shake when the sun\u0027s up and there\u0027s a pot of coffee on the go. Thanks ...Jake Cutter had had his fill of sleep en route; so he thought. He sat up downstairs and played a quiet game of poker with the Warrant Officer commanders of the military contingent from the second jet-copter. By three in the morning, however, they were all yawning; then, deciding to call it a night (or a new day), each of them went off to his cramped sleeping quarters.Jake didn\u0027t know it, but on the other side of his bunk\u0027s thin plasterboard panelling Liz Merrick had taken the cubicle next to his. Acting on Trask\u0027s instructions, she was intent on getting into his mind and following his progress through whatever esoteric activities might take place in his - and whoever else\u0027s - head or heads. Still not keen on what she was doing, Liz had nevertheless come to realize its importance.Frustrated when Jake stayed up, she had tried to wait him out and failed. But as finally he went to his bunk, and tossed and turned a while before settling down, she was disturbed and came awake. Following which it became a matter of establishing telepathic rapport. As Jake grew still and his breathing deepened, so Liz concentrated on strengthening her now instinctive connection with his subconscious mind, inviting his \u0027detached\u0027 thoughts to mingle with her own.Then for a while there was nothing, just a vague uneasiness of psyche as Jake\u0027s shields relaxed and his thoughts automatically sought to rearrange themselves into typical dream patterns, or perhaps into something else. And before too long Liz found herself nodding again ...... Until she came starting awake to an unnatural psychic stillness or pent awareness which had its origin in Jake. Next door, he was motionless and physically asleep; but psychically his mind was something else. It, too, was still - breathlessly still - like a cat watching a mouse emerge nervously from its hole; or more probably (Liz decided), like someone in an empty house, suddenly aware of an unusual sound in the night.He was listening to something - but so intently! - and for a moment Liz thought he had detected her presence. But no, while Jake\u0027s attention was definitely rapt upon a subconscious something, it wasn\u0027t focussed on Liz at all. On what, then?And so for an hour Liz \u0027listened\u0027 to Jake as attentively as he was listening to some sensed but unheard other or others, but with little or no result. On occasion he would come alive and ask, \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Or he would say: \u0027I know you are there - I hear you whispering - so why not talk to me instead of about me?\u0027 But even though Liz was given to understand something of this, she sensed rather than \u0027heard\u0027 what he said, because (a) Jake wasn\u0027t speaking to her directly, and (b) his recently discovered shields, while they weren\u0027t fully engaged, were neverthless shrouding his thoughts. Until unable to bear the not-knowing any longer, she tried to break in on him and ask, \u0027Who is it, Jake? Do you know them? What are they talking about?\u0027 At which the doors of Jake\u0027s mind at once slammed shut and she found herself locked out entirely. For a while, at least. But lying there on her bed, Liz believed she knew who he had been trying to talk to. And that was knowledge that sent a shudder down her spine, so that even in the oppressive heat of this El Nifio night, still she felt cold. And she also knew how he had detected her and shut her out. It was the difference.For the precog lan Goodly had had it right when he\u0027d said: \u0027When you heard Jake speaking, or thinking, that was your telepathy working. You heard him because he\u0027s alive. But the others ... they were in a different category, using a different mode.\u0027Deadspeak, yes. The difference between a live conversation and a dead one ...They were talking - arguing among themselves - about him, Jake Cutter. And Jake knew it. More than that, he knew or suspected who or what they were, which was something he had yet to remember and admit in his waking hours, perhaps because no sane man would ever want to admit such a thing. Well, with the possible exception of a handful of dubious psychic mediums.The dead in their graves were talking about him, and Jake could hear them like the buzzing of bees in a clover field, or more properly the rustle of dry leaves on a wintry garden path. For bees and flowering clover are redolent of burgeoning life, while the rustle of fallen leaves ... isn\u0027t.All of the voices belonged to strangers; he didn\u0027t know - or hadn\u0027t known - a single one of them. And while it was quite obvious that they heard him, no one bothered to answer Jake on the few occasions when he felt galvanized to break in on their conversation; but his brief bursts of eager questioning invariably found long-drawn-out silences following in their wake.And the worst of it was that these voices seemed afraid to talk out loud: they whispered, so that he found it difficult to follow what they were saying. But they seemed to be arguing the pros and cons, Jake\u0027s merits against his drawbacks, to what end he couldn\u0027t rightly say.We don\u0027t - we daren\u0027t - let them in among us! one of the voices said quite clearly. While another mumbled:But he isn\u0027t one of them. See, his light hums like a lantern in the dark, and we feel its warmth. Only the Necroscope - only Harry Keogh and his sons were ever like this - beacons in our everlasting night, or places to warm ourselves in the presence of the living; our only contact with the world and all the loved ones we left hehind.And another voice said, But in the end even the Necroscope succumbed. Is that what you would have us doP Befriend this one and give him access to the deadPAndifhe, too, were seduced - what then? A vampire in our midst, and. one who knows our every thought and secret? But the difference between a Necroscope and a necromancer ... 15 vast.Andmonstrous! said yet another, whose voice shuddered. We can\u0027t risk giving such a gift to anyone who would misuse it.But he already has the gift! said the voice, or its owner, who spoke in Jake\u0027s defence. And given to him by Harry himself, if we can believe what she has said.Ah, but she\u0027s not long cold. Naive in the ways of the long night, what can she know?She knew Harry,And what good did that do herp Like so many others before her, and like Harry himself, she too became a victim. No, she\u0027s no guarantee. And as for Harry: don\u0027t speak of him. The teeming dead know all about him.But Harry never harmed us! He was our friend and champion, right to ... to the end. But here the defending voice grew very quiet and uncertain.And what an end, said another small voice, when the Necroscope must Jlee his own world in order to keep faith!She was the last of the living who Harry spoke to, the one who was unafraid came back. She says he made promises - and he kept them. True, said another, more doleful voice. But Harry isolated himself for the sake of the living, not for the dead. I say we should trust the woman, the other insisted.No, said the doleful one. For in the end she brought down a DOOM upon herself. Why, she was fortunate that she only died! And now - if we trust this one on her word - perhaps she will bring a DOOM on all of us.At which point:\u0027Zek?\u0027 Jake tried again to cut in. \u0027Is it Zek you\u0027re talking about? Zek Foener?\u0027And again a long, cold silence. Until out of nowhere:I presented your case, Jake, and now we must let them talk it through. (Zek\u0027s voice, which he recognized at once.)\u0027Talk what through? I\u0027m not with you.\u0027 If the Great Majority, the teeming dead, decide that they don\u0027t want you to have or to use deadspeak, Zek explained, then you can talk all you like and they won\u0027t listen. They\u0027ll simply ignore you. Oh, they\u0027re drawn to you - we\u0027re all drawn to your warmth, Jake - but at the same time they\u0027re afraid of you. They were afraid of Nathan, too, once upon a time, but Nathan proved himself, showed them they were mistaken. If he was here now... well, he could far better plead your case than I can. \u0027And what about Harry?\u0027 Jake said. \u0027Where is he? Couldn\u0027t the Necroscope, er, \"plead my case\" - whatever that\u0027s supposed to mean - even better?\u0027Nof any longer, Zek answered.\u0027He did something to upset them?\u0027Something ... happened to him, she answered carefully.\u0027So/ Jake tried to reason it out, \u0027Harry is dead, but the Great Majority won\u0027t have any truck with him. Yet you get along okay with him, and that thing in the sump was positively clinging to him. All very weird.\u0027IfE-Branch, or Harry himself, had wanted you to know certain things, then I\u0027m sure they would have told you, said Zek.But Jake was still puzzling it out. \u0027Trask, lan Goodly and Lardis - yes, and Liz, too - they\u0027ve all had a go at hinting at something without being specific. They seem concerned that once I know the whole thing, or when I can see the big picture, then I\u0027ll run from it. But surely it would have to be something terrible to scare the Great Majority, who have absolutely nothing to lose! Yet even the dead won\u0027t spit it out up front. They speak in whispers, as if afraid to even talk about it. Not only that but Harry Keogh, a once-powerful metaphysical mind, is now an outcast among his own kind. So what in hell did he do ... ?\u0027Jake sensed that he must be close now. But so did Zek, who was anxious to divert him. And:Jake, she cut in, you\u0027ll have an explanation. All of this will be explained eventually - or you\u0027ll work it out for yourself - but for now let it go, and let the teeming dead deliberate. The wisdom of the ages is down in the earth, Jake. I can\u0027t see that they\u0027ll make a mistake on your account, /know they\u0027ll let you in ... eventually.\u0027Huh!\u0027 he snorted. \u0027In a way they\u0027re just like Trask; even like you, Zek! Everyone seems to think I should want to be \"in\" - that I should consider it a privilege - but all of these E-Branch types will tell you their talents are a curse. So why is it different for me? Why should I accept a curse? And just what sort of a curse is it, anyway? I mean, that is what this is all about, isn\u0027t it? The stuff that Trask isn\u0027t telling me? The bottom line? The downside?\u0027Then for a while there was silence in the psychic aether, until Zek said, I can\u0027t ask you to trust me, can\u0027t promise you anything, for the dangers are enormous. But one thing is certain: you can be the new Necroscope. You are the Necroscope, if only you\u0027ll accept it.\u0027I would accept it,\u0027 he told her then. \u0027I have accepted it in a way. For how can I deny what is? But if there\u0027s a short cut to my - well, to my being - then why can\u0027t I take it now? And as for the drawbacks ... surely it\u0027s my right to know what they are? I mean, what\u0027s the big mystery?\u0027 Jake, Zek answered, Harry Keogh was born with his skills, or with some of them at least, but you\u0027ve had them thrust upon you. What came naturally to Harry is coming unnaturally to you. But some things are so unnatural - and the very possibility of others is so frightening - as to make deadspeak and the Mobius Continuum seem mundane by comparison. \u0027Now, if that was intended to give me confidence - \u0027 Jake started to say, only to be cut off as Zek broke in: Personally, you wouldn\u0027t have been my choice. (He sensed the sad, reluctant shake of an incorporeal head.) But you were Harry Keogh\u0027s choice, which has to be good enough, for he must have had good reasons. And now there are others I have to talk to, others to convince - on your behalf, yes - on the far side of the world. Before I go, however, it seems only fair to tell you: you\u0027re not making it easy, Jake ... \u0027That seems to be one of my big problems - \u0027 he started to say, then realized that she was gone.But I am here, Jake, always, said another voice, phlegmy, lustful and darkly sinister, close and even too close to hand. The voice of Korath Mindsthrall, fading to a distant, bubbling chuckle.And in a little while, coming to Jake as if from far, far away, the whispering of the teeming dead started up again. But it was now more fearful than ever ...Morning found Jake in an introspective mood. But before he was up and about Liz took the opportunity to have a word in private with Trask about her experience of the previous night.They were out in the grounds, walking under the high wall, breathing easy while still the sun hung low in the east. It was early, and the dawn chorus of various parrot species was clattering in the still air. Another hour or two, the air would be dry and \u0027subtropical\u0027 Brisbane baking in furnace heat.Trask heard Liz out, was silent a while, thinking it over. Then he asked her: \u0027He was definitely using deadspeak?\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think so ... but does it matter? I mean, the way I understand it, as a Necroscope - or the Necroscope - his very thoughts are deadspeak. Unless he\u0027s shielding his thoughts, the dead will hear him thinking. And they will always know where he is. It\u0027s like an extra sense, their only sense. They can\u0027t see, hear, feel, taste or smell, but they\u0027ll know when he\u0027s near.\u0027Trask shook his head defeatedly. \u0027I probably know as much about deadspeak as anyone else,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Indeed, more than anyone else. But I still don\u0027t know about it. I talk about it, yes - I know it exists - but sometimes it\u0027s hard to believe in it. So don\u0027t ask me about it, because I don\u0027t know. Hell, Liz! You\u0027re the telepath!\u0027\u0027It was deadspeak,\u0027 she said. \u0027Or at least, he was listening to deadspeak. Listening to - my God! - to dead people, conversing in their graves. And they were talking about him. That was all I got: the fact that he could hear them and was trying to join in their conversation, but they wouldn\u0027t let him.\u0027\u0027Huh!\u0027 Trask grunted. \u0027Who can blame them? Neither would I \"let him in\" if I could help it. His bloody attitude ...\u0027\u0027But to mature, to be the Necroscope, he has to be able to talk to them, right?\u0027\u0027That\u0027s part of it, yes. Well, let\u0027s just hope it comes to him, as everything else will have to come to him - the good and the bad. And meanwhile you keep an eye, or an ear, on him.\u0027\u0027You\u0027re still hot sure of Jake, are you?\u0027 Liz said.Trask shrugged. \u0027I\u0027m not sure he\u0027s sure of us! And despite what he has said, I know he still has his own agenda. Anyway, I spoke to Premier Turchin about that, and I\u0027m hoping he can come up with some answers. If we can just find a way to lay that one ghost - kill off the one thing that\u0027s burning a hole in Jake\u0027s brain, this revenge thing, this course he\u0027s set on - maybe it will leave him with an open mind.\u0027\u0027You mean with Castellano out of the way, Jake would more easily be able to concentrate on the job in hand?\u0027 \u0027Right. So Turchin will try to dig some dirt on this fellow, see if he can get something solid on him. If we could lock him away it would be a start. But lan doesn\u0027t think that would be enough, not for Jake. And the hell of it is I understand: I know how Jake feels. Think yourself lucky, Liz, that you don\u0027t know the kind of hatred we\u0027re all capable of. What if I should tell you that I would gladly give my right arm at the shoulder just to see Nephran Malinari writhing, burning on a cross, and to revel in the stink of his smoke? Well, now I\u0027m telling you. And I mean it.\u0027 \u0027And Jake\u0027s no different,\u0027 she said, with a small shiver.\u0027Neither was the Necroscope Harry Keogh,\u0027 Trask told her. \u0027And neither am I. Few men are, when the crime and the pain it brings are nasty enough. An eye for an eye, Liz.\u0027 \u0027But in fact, Jake hardly knew that girl.\u0027 \u0027He knows that she was raped and tormented and died horribly, because of him. He knows it was fixed so that he\u0027d take the blame, and that Castellano tried to have him killed in the jail in Turin. That\u0027s enough. It would be enough for me, too.\u0027 \u0027Yet you\u0027re still hard on him. You think hard on him.\u0027But the other shook his head. \u0027He\u0027s hard on himself. Anyway, let it go now. And let\u0027s hope Turchin comes up with something.\u0027Hearing footsteps on the gravel drive, they look\u0027ed toward the house.It was the precog, lan Goodly. He came in his accustomed, long-legged lope - with a long face, too - for all the world a cadaverous mortician. \u0027Fresh coffee\u0027s on the go,\u0027 he said in his piping fashion. And: \u0027Did I hear someone mention Turchin?\u0027\u0027What about him?\u0027 said Trask.\u0027It was on the early news,\u0027 the precog answered. \u0027He\u0027ll be attending a couple of conference sessions this morning, but tonight or tomorrow he\u0027s out of here and back to Moscow.\u0027\u0027What?\u0027 Trask frowned. \u0027Moscow is the last place he\u0027d want to be right now. What happened?\u0027\u0027A fist fight, apparently,\u0027 Goodly answered. \u0027In Turchin\u0027s hotel bar last night. An Australian delegate got drunk, accused the Premier point-blank of lying about Russia\u0027s soft ecological policy, went on to call him a puppet mouthpiece for his industrial and military masters back home.\u0027\u0027Which right now is true as far as it goes,\u0027 Trask nodded. \u0027Mainly because he has no other choice. So what else?\u0027 \u0027Turchin got a drink thrown in his face before his minders stepped in and started throwing their weight around. The upshot is that he\u0027ll speak today - state Russia\u0027s case, protest about his treatment and what have you - and take the first plane out tomorrow. Tonight, if he can get one.\u0027 Turning it over in his mind, Trask stroked his chin. \u0027That doesn\u0027t sound like Gustav Turchin to me/ he said. \u0027Long before he made Premier he was a diplomat, could talk his way through a minefield. Something like this happens ... I just can\u0027t see him letting it happen.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Not unless he wanted it to happen. In which case ... it has to be a ploy.\u0027\u0027A ploy?\u0027 Goodly looked surprised.\u0027An excuse to get him out of here,\u0027 Trask said. \u0027He has a couple of things to organize in Moscow. I made a deal with him, gave him one or two problems to solve on our behalf. It\u0027s possible that the only place he could work on it is back in Russia. And isn\u0027t there another Earth Year Conference starting in Oslo in just a few days time? Acid rain or some such? I\u0027ll give you odds that\u0027s his next stop. He\u0027s something of a fox, Gustav Turchin. I\u0027m betting he\u0027ll go home, set a few wheels turning, then head for Oslo. And of course, with the rest of the world baying at his heels, it will make him something of a hero with his own people. A temporary thing, but it ought to distract his enemies a while. Anyway, and whatever\u0027s going on, wish him luck. Gustav has come through for us in the past and he probably will again. I\u0027ll brief you on our conversation later.\u0027\u0027Gustav?\u0027 said Goodly. \u0027First-name terms?\u0027\u0027Right,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027It\u0027s called detente, my friend. And with the Opposition, as it happens. Well, it won\u0027t be the first time.\u0027\u0027Tell me more,\u0027 said Goodly, wide-eyed. \u0027Later,\u0027 Trask said again, as they headed back towards the house...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-27.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire. He\u0027s got to start thinking about the future--or he won\u0027t have one!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:57 PM"}}
