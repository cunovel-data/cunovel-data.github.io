{"id":97215,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Charnel HouseIt was plain that Trask couldn\u0027t go on, so while he sat there shaking his head in a kind of numb disbelief, still seeking a reason for, or perhaps a solution to, his irreparable trauma, the precog lan Goodly took over. In contrast to Trask\u0027s harsh, grating rasp, his voice was almost melodious:\u0027It was a period of unrest among the old USSR\u0027s satellite countries,\u0027 he began, \u0027one of many since the death of European Communism. The former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, they were all in a state of political turmoil, and Radujevac stood at the crossroads, as it were, of all three nations. The Refuge was a kind of Sovereign Base Area - a British enclave, if you like - on foreign soil. But despite that, and as a result of its work, it was greatly respected and had achieved an almost diplomatic status. Of course, the British government had safe houses, embassies and the like, in all the former satellites. But because of the unrest access was always difficult, even to the Refuge.\u0027Well, Nathan Keogh arrived at our London HQ that night, and he was in the process of explaining what was happening in Sunside/Starside when Ben got there. At first Ben was overjoyed, even relieved to see him. Maybe this was what had sparked his dream; perhaps in some way he had anticipated this renewed contact with a friend from the once-hostile environment of the vampire world. But as Nathan\u0027s story unfolded, Ben\u0027s awareness his sense of dread, of foreboding - returned in short order. It was one of those times that come to all esp-endowed persons, when out of the blue they\u0027re made aware of the other side, the downside of their talents. And now more than ever Ben\u0027s talent was telling him that Zek\u0027s telepathic message had been no mere nightmare...\u0027As the precog paused, Trask levered himself off the desk, stood up straight and closed his eyes. He breathed in until his lungs couldn\u0027t take any more, then made for the door. And no one said anything until he had made an unsteady exit.Covering for his superior - though in fact Trask needed no such excuse - Goodly said, \u0027Did you hear the chopper?\u0027 (No one had.) \u0027Ben will want to see it safely down, and maybe ... maybe talk to the pilot?\u0027 He offered a shrug which was followed by an awkward silence, until Jake said:\u0027lan?\u0027 It was the first time he\u0027d used Goodly\u0027s first name. \u0027Will you finish it?\u0027Goodly looked mildly surprised as he answered, \u0027Of course. All of this is for you, after all. But in any case there\u0027s not much more to tell.\u0027 And in a little while:\u0027We had radio and telephone links to the Refuge,\u0027 the precog went on. \u0027Well, we should have had, but not that night. We tried but couldn\u0027t get through. And because of what Nathan had told us, we feared the worst. But Ben - denying, or even defying his own talent - he had to know for sure, of course. Several means were to hand.\u0027We called in our espers, everyone who was available, and put them to work. But long before the first of them arrived at the HQ, Nathan was volunteering his services. He\u0027d been to the Refuge before and its coordinates were locked in his mind. But if Ben was right and the Wamphyri had come through the subterranean Gate - and if they were still there - what then?\n \u0027For Ben, the next hour was an endless anxiety attack; he sweated and agonized over danger-fraught decisions and equally painful but inescapable truths. Having faith in his talent, he knew it was already too late - but it was Zek who was there at the Refuge! And Nathan: he would have gone at the snap of Ben\u0027s fingers - indeed, he was the only one who could go, along that special route of his. And in fact we had to restrain him, order him not to. And Ben weighing all of this in his tormented mind, all the time knowing in his heart that it was too late, that it had been too late from the moment he\u0027d started awake in a cold sweat at his home in Kensington.\u0027Then Millicent Cleary arrived; Milly is - now she is - the very best of our telepaths. And right on her heels our locator of long standing, David Chung. I\u0027ll never forget the scene in the Ops Room that night: Chung standing before the illuminated wall map with the tip of his index finger touching the location of Radujevac, and his left hand holding Milly\u0027s. We frequently work in tandem that way. And after only a second or so, their reactions:\u0027How David snatched himself back, away from the wall. And how Milly snatched back her hand from his! For the locator had sensed something - something at Radujevac, at the Refuge - and she had picked it right out of his mind: the clammy feel of it, its evil taint. Mindsmog!\u0027Milly had hoped to contact Zek; firm friends and colleagues, they knew each other\u0027s minds. But now, there was simply no trace of Zek\u0027s telepathic aura, no indication of life. Hers was a \"flatline\" on the monitor of telepathic awareness. And as for the overwhelming presence of mindsmog: it couldn\u0027t be denied or mistaken, and Ben\u0027s worst fears were corroborated.\u0027Of course, the Necroscope had his own way of looking into matters of that sort, but... no need to go into that here.\u0027Well, just like last night I blamed myself. Why hadn\u0027t I seen it coming? What good is a talent that only reveals itself when it wants to? Why is the future so bloody devious? I blamed myself that I hadn\u0027t foreseen it, while Ben was in hell for having seen it! And the rest of the team, they were depressed that they\u0027d had to confirm it. While at the Refuge, the mindsmog was rapidly dispersing ...\n \u0027After that, there was no holding Nathan. His father, Harry Keogh, had owed Zek favours. And Nathan himself was in her debt... not only was she a friend, one who had fought alongside him in Starside, but she\u0027d even been involved with his discovery of the Mobius Continuum. No less than Ben, Nathan knew he wouldn\u0027t rest until he - until they - were sure. Not sure that Zek was dead, for all of us knew that by then, but sure that she would never be wndead.\u0027And so we armed ourselves, and Nathan took us to the Refuge. But a refuge no longer, for now it was a charnel house...\u0027Ben, myself, Chung, and Lardis - huh! Try keeping the Old Lidesci out of it; he\u0027d loved Zek dearly - Nathan took us along the Mobius route to Radujevac. It was some two hours, maybe two and a half, since Ben had come awake from his nightmare. More than enough time for the ... the slaughter of the staff and children. From what we saw, twenty minutes had been enough!\u0027Those poor kids, and the people who had looked after them; their torn, sometimes shrivelled bodies were already cold. They had been dead before Ben had driven his car even halfway in to the HQ. And I believe that seeing that for himself - that knowing there was nothing he could have done - was the only thing that kept him sane.\u0027There were no survivors. Thirty-six kids and eight staff, dead or... or disappeared. Gone from us, anyway. For you see, we knew only too well that the ones who weren\u0027t there ... that they weren\u0027t survivors, either. And certainly they\u0027d have been better off dead. For they were now undead, or if not now, then soon. There was no other explanation for their absence; unless they had simply been taken as food, for later. But if that was the case, why only adults, when the children had been murdered out of hand and left behind? Anyway:\n \u0027The missing staff, three of them - or rather two of them, since last night - were Denise Karalambos, a paediatrician from Athens, Andre Corner, a psychiatric specialist from London, and ... and someone who isn\u0027t any longer a problem: Bruce Trennier, the engineer. As for why they were singled out, there are theories but we can\u0027t be sure. Trennier, as we\u0027ve seen, found favour as a lieutenant. Perhaps the others are similarly situated. But anyone who feels sorry for them can forget it. They\u0027d be better off dead - they\u0027re going to be better off dead. At least, that has to be our point of view. Not to mention our intention.\n \u0027But about Zek - and excuse me if I seem offhand; it\u0027s simply that I find it best to be cold about certain things, for I\u0027m sure my emotions would be just as fragile as anyone else\u0027s if I were to forget myself and let them hold sway - Zek hadn\u0027t suffered. When that blast hit the sump, she hadn\u0027t felt a thing. Down in the basement, everything was askew. The reinforced concrete floor had buckled upwards; the turrets had been blown off their bases like popping a pair of corks; the cave of the resurgence ... simply wasn\u0027t there any more! The walls and roof were completely caved in, and it\u0027s a wonder that the rear end of the Refuge hadn\u0027t followed suit.\u0027The Wamphyri and their lieutenants must have felt it, too: that awesome blast. Indeed, any creature in that basement - any creature of normal flesh and blood - would have been stunned by the concussion or even killed by the shock of it. But then, the Wamphyri aren\u0027t human, and in all probability it only served to enrage them further. Certainly they raged through the Refuge.\u0027The only good thing to come of it all, as far as I could tell, was that one of those bloody awful Gates was now well and truly closed. Oh, the Gate itself was still there, miles up the underground river, under the Carpathian foothills, but its single exit was finally blocked by two thousand tons of fractured concrete slabs and God only knows how much solid rock.\u0027So much for that, but what about the three creatures who had come through and were already in our world? What about them and their lieutenants, and now a trio of new thralls to aid and advise them in their Earthly ventures? And three very intelligent thralls, at that, who knew the ways of Earth?\u0027That, we believe, is the main reason why those three were spared ... or cursed, depending on how you see it: because they could add to Malinari\u0027s intelligence of this new and potentially dangerous world. And we also see something of his cunning - and of his ruthlessness, too - in the murder of the innocents. It was simply a matter of leaving no one behind to speak about what they had witnessed.\u0027For you see, only six of the victims appeared to have ... to have been used. And where they had been fairly well drained, the rest of them were just dead. But horribly dead. For most of them it had been instantaneous: stiffened fingers with nails as hard and as sharp as chisels had chopped through their backs or into their chests, to break their spines or crush their hearts. The terrible strength of the Wamphyri! But others ... we don\u0027t think some of the others had it so, well, so \"easy\".\u0027I said that certain corpses were shrivelled. But \"shrivelled\" doesn\u0027t say it all by any means. Lardis, when he saw those bodies, said it was Szwart\u0027s work. It wasn\u0027t simply a reduction of bodily fluids but of... I don\u0027t know, of the substance, the essence - the soul? - of the victims. The destruction of whatever it is that makes a person human, giving him shape, character, humanity, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u0027 These pitiful things, they no longer had any of that. Picture the last apple on the tree, all wrinkled and dried out by the sun, all fallen in, with the last of its juices fermented and sick inside it. When it falls or if you touch it, its skin splits, and deep in its core the pulp is rotten and black. That\u0027s what they were like ... \u0027And there were others whose eyes were open, staring, quite empty, and for all that they were dead I couldn\u0027t help but feel that they hadn\u0027t known very much about it. Their bodies weren\u0027t shrivelled like those of Szwart\u0027s victims, no, but it seemed to me that their minds had been. And Lardis told us Malinari would have been responsible for that.\n \u0027As for the female victims: their pale dead faces were full of awe, amazement ... rapture? Some kind of exquisite, delicious agony? It\u0027s true that I don\u0027t have the words for it, but I might have a name: Vavara....\u0027\n Well, enough. There are no words that can say how we felt. Appalled doesn\u0027t nearly cover it. And nothing we could do about it, not then, not immediately. What, we should alert the authorities, shout it to the world, initiate total panic and put the fear of God and all the devils of hell into every mortal human being on the entire planet ... if we were believed? We couldn\u0027t do any of those things, and for obvious reasons. Can\u0027t you just picture the witchhunts? God, but we\u0027d be back in the Dark Ages! Witch-pricking and human bonfires, and licences to torture and kill handed out willy-nilly, free to anyone with a grudge.\n \u0027Medical research would stop, stop dead - or undead! The laboratories would search for cures, of course they would, and spread the thing faster than a plague. Blood donors? You think we\u0027re short of blood now? But blood would become the most precious of commodities, and keeping it the first priority. People locked in their homes, making them impregnable fortresses, defending them with guns, silver, stakes, crossbows and whatever. And the filthy rich with their private armies, making the odd, eccentric hermit of, say, Howard Hughes\u0027s meager stature seem like a high-profile socialite by comparison.\u0027Borders. In the last fifteen to twenty years we\u0027ve seen them open up. Britain has been cagey about controls, passports and such, thank God - but Europe? Can\u0027t you just imagine the panic, see the chaos as all the old rules and statutes were reinstated, the checkpoints rushed back into being, with armed guards at ports and airports, and not forgetting the reservoirs, farms, fisheries, and ... and anywhere where food is processed? And how long before countries started blaming each other?\u0027When the shit - excuse me, the accusations - started flying, Russia and Romania would probably take the brunt of it, if only because the Gates are on their territory. But what about the UK, Great Britain? We\u0027ve known about the Gates for thirty-odd years! Or am I just talking about \"we,\" the team, the organization - E-Branch itself, for God\u0027s sake - and our involvement? As for our Minister Responsible, the \"Invisible Man\" at the top: hull\n But haven\u0027t we all heard about this - er, how does it go? - this \"culpable deniability,\" or some such gobbledygook? \"Damage limitation,\" and the like? Does anyone care to guess what those things really mean? They\u0027re just ways of carrying on lying to cover up unpalatable truths that weren\u0027t told the first time around, that\u0027s all. And folks, what that boils down to is we would get crucified! The end of E-Branch ... and who would look after the shop then?\u0027And that\u0027s not the end of it. Hell, I\u0027ve barely started! Sooner or later the world would find out that the Russians had actually made the Gate at Perchorsk, an experiment that didn\u0027t work out. And the same world would demand that they destroy it. Too damned late, of course, but destroy it anyway. Oh, really? What, with Mikhail Suvorov\u0027s henchmen in Moscow still waiting for it to pay off) They should shut down a potential goldmine just because the gold-greedy West couldn\u0027t stand the competition? And can\u0027t you just see the old Iron Curtain slamming shut again, and that old red flag flying as before?\u0027Oh, they might get the message eventually - when nights turned to nightmares - and then they\u0027d destroy it quick enough. But how? As they were ready to do it the last time around, with nukes? For just like the rest of us the Soviets have made \"progress\" in the last quarter-century, and I really don\u0027t care to speculate about what they might do now ... but I will, if only to make the point and get this over and done with:\n \u0027Nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons; missiles with multiple warheads, launched through the Gate at Perchorsk. The total devastation of a world - Nathan\u0027s world - and Nathan and all his people, all the Szgany, with it. Neutron bombs, yes, so that all life would die but the gold would still be there, with no one and nothing to deny its plundering, its massive, planetwide tomWooting! Which is fine, or not, except we don\u0027t even know if neutron radiation will kill the Wamphyri. Only that it will kill everything else.\n \u0027And meanwhile the vampires would be raging on this world.Because if we killed a couple of thralls, the Lords would make more. Survival, people: the damned survival of the damned! And how long before total embargoes - in effect, sieges - were laid on entire islands, nations, continents, as the terror overtook them one by one? And how long then before the missiles and the neutron bombs were flying again, this time on our world? We\u0027ve had \"final solutions\" before, but there are holocausts and holocausts.\u0027I mentioned the Dark Ages, but I think we could probably go back, oh, a couple of centuries earlier than that...\u0027... So, you see, we couldn\u0027t tell anyone. It was our baby, and we\u0027d just have to handle it ourselves. BUT ... if we handled it our way - E-Branch\u0027s way, the right way - then we might have a chance. And in fact there were several clues that indeed we had a chance. \u0027It was a question of thinking it all through, then using our combined talents to check on our conclusions. Very well, so why had Vavara, Szwart, and Malinari left Starside to come venturing in our world? Where were the benefits for them? What was wrong with Sunside that they\u0027d left it to their lieutenants and burgeoning vampire army in favour of Earth?\u0027But they were known on Sunside, indeed they were figures from legend there, and the Szgany knew how to fight them; fight them with alien weapons and the incredible skills of the Necroscope, Nathan Keogh. Also, these vampires were ambitious beyond the bloodiest dreams of almost any other Lords or Ladies of the Wamphyri before them. Perhaps the world of Sunside/Starside was too limiting in its scope. But Earth...\u0027They\u0027d learned of Earth from Mikhail Suvorov and his ill-fated team of explorer-prospectors. They knew us: that without our weapons we were softer far than the Szgany of Sunside. And there were millions, indeed billions of us, spread out in many different nations across a world that was as wide as its horizons. Not merely a single strip of habitable woodlands between barrier mountains and burning deserts, but a huge and thriving termite\u0027s nest of sprawling humanity! A land of milk and honey - and blood, of course - stretching out forever.\n \u0027Better far, we didn\u0027t believe in vampires! In our world a vampire was a fiction, a creature in a book, a myth out of our superstitious past. Even in Romania, Hungary, or the Greek Islands, you\u0027d have trouble finding more than a handful who truly believe in vampires today. In E-Branch, however, we have known for a long time that they never were a myth, that indeed there were vampires in our world once before, and maybe more than once.\u0027And Zek, she knew it, too, and knew it better than most. She had actually lived in the Lady Karen\u0027s aerie, on Starside.\u0027 So perhaps the mentalist Lord Malinari took something from her after all, the fact that earlier invaders had learned an important lesson: in this world longevity is synonymous with anonymity. But having faced - or having sent their thralls to face - Mikhail Suvorov\u0027s firepower on Starside, maybe they\u0027d known that before they set out.\u0027There\u0027s evidence of that last, too. Suvorov\u0027s party went through from Perchorsk, emerging into Starside through the surface Gate. But the Wamphyri chose the other route, the original or natural Gate into our world, probably because they knew that Perchorsk was once again a semi-military base and defended, and all of its weapons concentrated in one spot, the Perchorsk Gate itself. Hardly a good place to commence a covert infiltration.\u0027\u0027But the best evidence that Malinari and the others intended to keep their presence secret, at least for the time being, lay with those poor dead kids and murdered staff. For they had not been vampirized! No vampire essence - nothing of that sort - had been allowed to get into them. So plainly it wasn\u0027t the intention of the Wamphyri to start a plague. Not yet, anyway.\n \u0027But people had been killed, murdered by vampires, and the Old Lidesci wouldn\u0027t be satisfied until the bodies were burned. While he had found no trace of infection in them - not even in the six who\u0027d been used, drained - still he was insistent. And since no one in this world has Lardis\u0027s experience in such matters, the experience of so many years, no one argued the point.\n \u0027What was more, the ... the cremation that Lardis insistedupon fitted perfectly with a plan we were shaping, however gradually. For not only were we unable to bring the presence of the Wamphyri into the open, but we must actually disguise it, cover it up, assist them in their efforts to remain secret! Secret to the world in general, at least, but not to us, not to E-Branch. No, for we knew our enemy of old.\u0027There was fuel oil, plenty of it, at the Refuge. Ben saw to it that the entire contents of a fifty-gallon drum went down the wrecked inspection ducts, then we punctured the rest of the drums and let the fuel leak through all the ground floor rooms. And finally we stood off while Nathan struck a match. That one match was all it took.\u0027It could only be the act of a maniac or group of maniacs, some kind of crazed sect. Or perhaps sabotage, the work of some anti-British terrorist organization? Or maybe a band of utterly ruthless criminals, determined to cover up their crime. At any rate, that was how it would look...\u0027Well, Romanian rescue services are notoriously slow, and where the Refuge stood across the Danube from Radujevac ... it wasn\u0027t the most populated or accessible region. The Danube itself was the most frequented route through the countryside. Fortunately for us there were no landing stages, wharves or docks on the Romanian side, and the nearest fire engine was all of a hundred miles away!\u0027So we watched the Refuge burn, and eventually Nathan took us home again. But back in London we took our time before calling the authorities in Belgrade, Sofia, Bucharest, to tell them we\u0027d had an SOS, a Mayday, from the Refuge, that a gang of raiders was sacking the place. It took them a couple of days to get back to us with their condolences; their security forces would do all they could to bring the unknown marauders to justice, of course, but since the Refuge had been gutted there was precious little to go on ...\u0027And meanwhile, we were busy. / was busy, bending all my efforts to scan the future as never before. But... the simple fact is I can\u0027t force what I do, can\u0027t control it. I see what I see when I see it, and that\u0027s it. And our locators were busy, none more so than David Chung. But where to look? There was no more mindsmog, and there were no borders in continental Europe. The three invaders, their lieutenants out of Starside and their \"raw\" recruits, they could be anywhere. They could have crossed the river west into Yugoslavia, gone east into Bulgaria, headed north into the Carpathians, or caught a boat up-river for Hungary. In daylight hours they\u0027d go to earth, or to any dark, safe place. But at night... no one travels as fast as the Wamphyri.\u0027Nathan suggested returning to Sunside for Anna-Marie English, but to what purpose? The invaders were leaving no \"blight\" behind them. As yet, they weren\u0027t vampirizing anyone. Murders? But there are always murders, and there are always missing persons. No, we couldn\u0027t hope to track them that way. In any case, Anna-Marie wouldn\u0027t have come back; she has dedicated her life to the orphans of the bloodwars, and to her man in Sunside.\u0027The mindsmog thing puzzled us a while: the lack of it. For where there are vampires, and especially Lords of the Wamphyri, there is usually mindsmog: a tainted, impenetrable cloud on the psychic aether ... unless that was something else that Malinari had stolen from Zek\u0027s mind? But of course it was! He had also been about to learn something of E-Branch from her - until she had deliberately shortened his interrogation by showing him his intended doom, which had precipitated and mercifully shortened her own.\u0027But just how much did he know? How much had he sapped from Zek\u0027s mind, her memory, her knowledge in general and especially of the Branch? We had no way of knowing. But it must have been sufficient that he and the others felt the need to lie low and control their alien mental emissions. Or perhaps we were wrong and they were simply being cautious, biding their time.\n \u0027Nathan stayed with us for five days, just long enough to look up a few old... well, acquaintances? But he was needed in Sunside and dared not delay any longer. And remember, his problem was as great if not greater than ours: a small army of aspiring Lords lieutenants, thralls, and warrior creatures, left behind by our trio of Wamphyri invaders; an army which now inhabited the toppled ruins of Starside\u0027s ancient aeries, from which they raided on the Szgany as before. No, we had no claim on Nathan; indeed, our long-term debt to him could never be repaid. And so we had to let him go, with our best wishes - and as many weapons as he could take with him - back along the Mobius route to rejoin the battle for his vampire world.\n \u0027And through all of that time, that terrible, frantic week, the only one of us who wasn\u0027t busy was Ben Trask. He had simply withdrawn from a world that would never be the same again, and I admit that I thought E-Branch had seen the last of him. Fortunately I was wrong, and when he returned he was stronger than ever - well, in some ways - but in his resolve, for sure.\u0027And now I\u0027ll tell you something that even he doesn\u0027t know. I was Duty Officer that night at E-Branch HQ - that night when Nathan brought Lardis through from Sunside, and Ben nightmared about Zek - and the moment that Ben came in and I saw the state he was in, I... I knew about Zek. I mean, I knew!\u0027Oh, I couldn\u0027t tell him, but where he was uncertain and daren\u0027t allow himself to be sure, I knew and hated myself for knowing. Just seeing him like that, Ben\u0027s future was immediately apparent to me. In one way it was the clearest picture of anyone\u0027s future that I\u0027d even seen, yet in another it was the vaguest - which was how I knew.\u0027For all I saw was how cold and lonely that future wouldbe...\u0027Goodly\u0027s delivery, the way he had told the story of the events of that night at E-Branch HQ from his own personal viewpoint - the obvious passion and compassion in this apparently reserved, indeed phlegmatic man - had brought him into far greater definition in Jake\u0027s perception; or rather, it had brought him into focus as a three-dimensional character in his own right. Previously a shadow or a soft-voiced cipher, he had somehow filled out. And Jake understood now that the precog had been a major part of this scene for a very long time.Now, too, and also for the first time, Goodly\u0027s physical person had impressed itself upon the Branch\u0027s most recent however hesitant recruit. lan Goodly: all of six feet four inches tall, skeletally thin and gangly, grey-haired and mainly gaunt-featured. His expression was usually grave; he rarely smiled; only his eyes - warm, brown, and totally disarming - belied what invariably constituted an unfortunate first-impression appearance, that of a cadaverous mortician. Except, and as Jake was suddenly aware, you can\u0027t always tell a book from its cover. He would have done better to take more notice of Goodly\u0027s eyes than his outline.Outside the Ops truck, he cornered the precog and drew him away from the others into the shade of a tree.\u0027What is it?\u0027 Goodly asked, though he believed he already knew well enough. For just like Trask and Lardis Lidesci before him, he\u0027d left several blank pages in his telling of the story. Jake was still fishing for the bits that would bring the whole thing into focus.\u0027Just you and me/ Jake answered. \u0027Just the two of us, and no one else to confuse the issue. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions? I mean, right from square one I\u0027ve had this feeling that you\u0027re on my side, that you think I should be told the whole thing. The others are holding stuff back, but you\u0027re reluctant to do so. Am I right?\u0027Goodly smiled a wry smile, sighed and said, Til tell you what I can. But even though you\u0027re right about my being on your side - or rather, about my talent being on your side - still I won\u0027t be able to answer all of your questions. The Branch comes first, and Ben Trask is the Branch. What Ben says goes.\u0027\n \u0027Some of my questions, then,\u0027 Jake pressed. And he quickly went on: \u0027So you\u0027re a precog, right? And this talent of yours, this precognition, it lets you see into the future?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the general idea,\u0027 Goodly sighed again. \u0027But only a very rough idea, for it\u0027s not nearly as simple as that. Haven\u0027t I made that plain?\u0027 And now he was frowning.\n \u0027Okay, fine,\u0027 Jake placated him. \u0027But you did tell me you\u0027d seen some of my future, right? You did say that I\u0027d be with you, with E-Branch, for quite some time to come.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s true, yes,\u0027 Goodly answered.\u0027In what capacity?\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u0027Okay, then is it going to be that way simply because Trask won\u0027t let me go off and do my own thing, or ... ?\u0027\u0027Possibly because he won\u0027t let you go,\u0027 the precog answered. \u0027He has to see how you work out, which could take a while. That could be - it obviously is - part of the reason why I\u0027ve foreseen your continuing presence, yes. But what is this, Jake? Are you still uncertain? I thought you\u0027d decided to stay?\u0027\u0027... Or, is it mainly because he thinks I\u0027m going to be useful to you?\u0027 Jake ignored Goodly\u0027s last.\u0027Well, that too, we hope. But Jake, you\u0027re talking in circles. And I don\u0027t see - \u0027\u0027 - I\u0027m getting to it!\u0027 Jake growled, his attitude intense now. And after a moment\u0027s thought: \u0027So tell me, is it me, Jake Cutter, who\u0027ll be useful to you, or is it this Harry?\u0027\u0027Er, that was my meaning, yes,\u0027 said the precog, \u0027that the Necroscope would definitely be useful to us. But if you want me to pick and choose, I can\u0027t do it. I would have to answer, both of you - you\u0027ll both be extremely useful to us. I thought that had been made plain, too.\u0027\u0027He\u0027s ... what, contacting me, this Harry? Getting into my head to guide me, is that it?\u0027 Jake was pushing it now. \u0027Or is he simply using me?\u0027\u0027Using you? Personally, I would say he\u0027s keeping you safe. Wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027\u0027But in my head, like telepathy? A kind of telepathic control?\u0027 Jake scowled.\n \u0027Telepathy?\u0027 Goodly seemed uncertain. \u0027Something like telepathy, yes. But Harry had a different name for it.\u0027\u0027\"Had\"? Why is it that when we talk about this Harry everything has to be past tense?\u0027 Then Jake gave a snort. \u0027Huh! Dumb question - because he\u0027s dead, of course! - which I can\u0027t see at all. For if he\u0027s dead, how can he do whatever it is he\u0027s doing to me? See, I don\u0027t believe in ghosts. They\u0027re a concept I just can\u0027t seem to wrap my head around. And as for Harry Keogh: he\u0027s something I don\u0027t want to wrap my head around, even though it\u0027s apparent he\u0027s already seen to that! But, since he\u0027s obviously a disembodied voice out of the past, then it must be equally obvious that his talent was similar to yours. I mean, Harry didn\u0027t so much read the future as reach into it... is how it seems to me? But okay, fine, let\u0027s keep it going: so if what he\u0027s doing to me isn\u0027t telepathy, then what did he call it?\u0027\u0027It wouldn\u0027t help you to know, not at this stage.\u0027 Goodly shook his head. \u0027In fact it could easily become an obstruction, a deterrent to your acceptance of... of everything.\u0027Jake\u0027s frustration was mounting again. \u0027A deterrent to my acceptance?\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Don\u0027t you think there are enough deterrents already? It\u0027s nuts, all of it! I mean, what am I, some kind of psychic medium? If there was a reason, just one logical reason, why I should suddenly become this dead bloke\u0027s target, his focus, his genius loci, then I might be willing to believe at least some of this ... this whatever. See, I know that what I\u0027ve actually seen and experienced so far is real, but I don\u0027t know that a lot of what I\u0027ve been told is real. I trust my own five senses, or used to, but I don\u0027t understand how or why I\u0027m involved. I\u0027d even like to believe what I\u0027ve heard, if only as an alternative to considering myself some kind of psycho, some kind of schizoid nutcase. But ... but... but Harry is fucking dead!\u0027\n \u0027Well, in a way he\u0027s dead,\u0027 said the precog, just as serious as ever, as if their conversation was utterly mundane. \u0027But you see, Harry didn\u0027t view existence, life and death, as we do. There was a time when he really was two people. It was after he suffered\n ... well, an accident, that his mind temporarily manifested itself in the identity of his own infant son. And later, he underwent another singular change. Best to think of it as a kind of metempsychosis, or - \u0027\n \u0027Metempsychosis?\u0027 Jake cut him short. For despite that he was sure he\u0027d never heard the word before, still he understood it; likewise another word that meant much the same thing. \u0027You mean transmigration? Of souls? Like he was ... what, some kind of body-snatcher?\u0027 And now suspicion was written plain on the younger man\u0027s face.\u0027It wasn\u0027t like that at all!\u0027 the precog protested.\u0027What?\u0027 Jake\u0027s voice was brittle now, cracking like glass splintering under the heel of a boot. \u0027I don\u0027t give a twopenny toss what it was like! Shit, look at it from my point of view! This bloke\u0027s dead but he\u0027s trying to control my mind? And then what, my body? And if he ever got it, do you really think he\u0027d want to give it back? And what about me, Mr lan bloody Goodly, precog? What the fuck about me? Is that why you can\u0027t tell me my future? Because the real me doesn\u0027t have one!?\u0027\u0027Calm down, for goodness sake!\u0027 Goodly looked alarmed. \u0027My word, but you\u0027ve a very short memory, Jake Cutter!\u0027\u0027Eh?\u0027 That had served to slow Jake down a little. \u0027A short memory? How so?\u0027\u0027But didn\u0027t Harry get you out of jail? Hasn\u0027t he saved your life twice already, and Liz\u0027s, too?\u0027Jake considered it, relaxed a very little, said: \u0027But what does he hope to do with me, this ... this ghost?\u0027\u0027Well, perhaps that\u0027s one I can answer,\u0027 Goodly told him. \u0027You see, the Necroscope\u0027s principal tenet was that whatever a man does in life he will continue to do after death. He proved it, too: used it to discover the Mobius Continuum. You\u0027ll just have to take my word for that, for the time being, anyway. But Harry\u0027s greatest claim to fame, or one of them, lay in finding and destroying vampires. Oh yes, the Earth was infested before this latest invasion. And believe me, Jake, without the Necroscope on our side, our world would have become an unimaginable hell-hole of a place a long time ago. So ...\u0027\u0027... So, you think he intends to keep on doing what he did before/ Jake nodded his understanding, all the while fighting hard to suppress his disbelief. \u0027This Harry... he\u0027s trying to come back because he somehow knows they have come back, and he wants to go on killing vampires. He\u0027s the avenging ghost and I... I\u0027m his gadget?\u0027The precog shrugged and answered, \u0027And there you have it.\u0027Jake shook his head, looked bewildered, said: \u0027Come again? Didn\u0027t you get something backwards just then? Surely you meant there it has me!\u0027But Goodly was weary of this now. \u0027As you will,\u0027 he answered. And, pursing his thin lips, he turned away.Jake saw his mistake, didn\u0027t want to alienate someone who obviously gave a damn, and quickly said, \u0027Listen, I appreciate everything you\u0027ve told me. I\u0027m not trying to mess you about - none of you - but looking for a little firm ground, somewhere I can safely plant my feet. The way I\u0027m feeling, every step is like quicksand. And what you just said doesn\u0027t help any. What, I\u0027m supposed to be happy with the notion of this Harry working his will through me, if not actually on me? Well, that\u0027s probably fine by you E-Branch people, all nice and safe in your own talented little skulls, but - \u0027\u0027But ... there\u0027s no safe place in E-Branch, Jake,\u0027 the precog cut him short, glancing back over his shoulder. \u0027However, I did say you would be around for quite some time. Which with the Necroscope - or something of him - on your side, seems a very fair forecast to me.\u0027\u0027But a ghost?\u0027\u0027There are ghosts and ghosts/ the other answered, walking away.\n \u0027But he\u0027s dead, for Christ\u0027s sake!\u0027 Made meaningless now, through repetition, still Jake\u0027s exclamation exploded from his dry lips. \u0027And not just a ghost - not just any old spook - but one who has access to my mind!\u0027\u0027In E-Branch/ Goodly told him, without looking back, we do believe in ghosts, especially in the ghost of Harry Keogh. We have every good reason to. But that\u0027s something you don\u0027t have to take my word for, Jake. You see, I\u0027m sure that before very long you 11 believe in them, too. I, Mr lan bloody Goodly, precog, am very sure of it, yes .. / \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-16.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
