{"id":97200,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"In Xanadu, Jethro Manchester had built a pleasure dome, in fact the Pleasure Dome Casino. But that was some time ago, and since then Manchester\u0027s fortunes had changed. Now both the casino and the mountain resort of Xanadu belonged to another, to Aristotle Milan, and the new resident-owner\u0027s needs required that he make certain alterations.The casino was a great dome of glass and chrome. It was a three-storey affair - or four-storey, if one included a smaller dome, which sat like a bubble or a raised blister on top of the main structure - that lorded its location at Xanadu\u0027s hub, on a false plateau in a high, dog-leg fold of the Australian Macpherson Range of mountains.\n Now it was night, but still the work on Mr Milan\u0027s alterations continued. He wanted the work completed to his specifications before he reopened Xanadu to the public in just a few days\u0027 time. And in his private accommodation in the high bubble dome, Milan himself supervised the last of the work; or if not supervised, at least he was there to see it finished to his satisfaction. But Milan\u0027s presence - or more specifically the annoyance that accompanied it - wasn\u0027t to Derek Hinch\u0027s liking.\n Hinch was a painter and decorator, but at times like this he tended to think of himself more as a steeplejack. Inside the bubble it wasn\u0027t so bad ... there wasn\u0027t very far to fall if he made the VTTT classic mistake of stepping back a few paces to admire his work! But outside, some fifty or sixty feet off the ground: that had been nerve-racking, and thank God he was done with it now.But black? Painting perfectly good windows black, both inside and out? It didn\u0027t make a lot of sense to Derek Hinch. And as for Mr Milan: he didn\u0027t make much sense either! The guy must be some kind of eccentric, a nut case, albeit a very rich, powerful one. The way he prowled through the glitzy false opulence of this place, apparently lost in some indefinable distance, in space and time; though mainly (Hinch suspected) lost in a world of his own, the extravagance of his thoughts.And his music ... his bloody terrible, interminable music! There was a gleaming antique jukebox at one end of a small, gently curving, mahogany-topped bar on the perimeter of the bubble, and when Milan was taking it easy he would sit there in an armchair with a drink, just listening to the music ... the same damn tunes or songs, or just, well, music, over and over again. And it was driving Hinch nuts, too!Not that Hinch didn\u0027t care for the stuff; he liked - or he used to like, and he would have continued to like - all of this stuff just fine ... if he hadn\u0027t been obliged to listen to each piece at least thirty or forty times in the space of just seven nights. So thank God he was almost finished here!But nights! Why in hell couldn\u0027t this work be done in daylight hours? And why in hell couldn\u0027t Milan sleep nights - like any other mad millionaire? And why in double-damned Ml did he have to play his bloody music like this!?What was it that was playing now? Damn, the tunes had kind of run together in Hindi\u0027s head; he had heard them so often, he knew what was coming next! Mr rich-foreign-handsome-bloody-bastard Milan kept playing them in sequence, in some kind of order of preference. But it was the order of disorder, totally out of order, to Hinch\u0027s way of thinking.\n Oh, yes - now he remembered - Zorba\u0027s Dance, that was it! All bouzoukis, fast drumbeats, and Anthony bloody Quinn dancing on a beach! A Greek thing that was almost as much an antique as the machine that played it. One of those tunes that never dies, one which as far as Hinch was concerned could die any time it fucking well liked! And of course as the tune ended, Hinch knew the next item in the circular, never-ending repertoire. And here it came yet again:\u0027Sunshine, you may find my window but you won\u0027t find me ...\u0027 Some kind of blues with a Country and Western flavour, and lyrics too deep for Hinch to understand ... pleasing to listen to, even soothing, in a way... if you hadn\u0027t heard it half a dozen times already this very night! Some old black guy, singing his heart out about misery. But to Hinch\u0027s mind the only misery lay in having to listen to it over and over again.\u0027So, you don\u0027t care for my music, Mr Hinch?\u0027 The voice was deep yet oiled; it seemed to rumble, or purr, yet was in no way cat-like. On the other hand, Milan\u0027s movements were cat-like as he came from the bar with a drink in his long-fingered hand, to gaze out on the night through an open window.\n But if it wasn\u0027t painted black, (Hinch thought), there\u0027d \\\u003ee no need to open the fucking thing! Not that there\u0027s anything to see out there. While out loud he said, \u0027Er, did I say something about your music? I have a habit of talking to myself while I\u0027m working. It doesn\u0027t mean anything.\u0027 Oh yes it fucking does! It means that I\u0027m pissed to death with you, and your bloody music, and with bloody Kanadu, and all of this bloody black paint!\n He looked down on Milan from a height of some twelve feet, from a wheeled scaffolding tower where he had just put the finishing touches to the last pane of a high window. And that was it: the entire interior surface, every square foot of hundreds of square feet of glass, varnished for adhesion, painted black, and finally layered with polyurethane lacquer for durability. A double-dyed bastard of a job!\u0027Perhaps I don\u0027t pay you enough?\u0027 said Milan, as Hinch put down his roller, wiped his hands, came clambering down from on high.\u0027The money\u0027s fine,\u0027 the bad-tempered Hinch said. He stoodsix feet tall, but still had to lift his head a fraction to look up at his employer. \u0027And I\u0027d like it now, for I\u0027m all done.\u0027\u0027Then if the payment is fine,\u0027 said Milan, \u0027it can only be that I was right and it\u0027s the music. Or perhaps it\u0027s me? Do you find my presence unsettling?\u0027While he was speaking, Hinch had checked him out - again. For Aristotle Milan was the kind of man you looked at twice. At a guess he\u0027d be maybe forty, forty-five years old. Difficult to be more specific than that, because his looks were sort of timeless. He was probably sixty but topped-up with expensive monkey hormones or some such. Something was running through his veins, keeping him young, for sure. Spoiled, rich bastard!But foreign? Even without the name to give him away, there could be no mistaking that: Italian with a touch of Greek - but in any case a mongrel, in Hinch\u0027s eyes. Milan\u0027s hair was black as night; worn long, it swept back from a high, broad forehead, and its shining ringlets curled on his shoulders. And handsome: he had the kind of Mediterranean looks that seemed to appeal to a lot of women. Hinch would guess that his bedroom crawled with all kinds of young, good-looking, dirty women.His ears were fleshy - what could be seen of them - but he wore his sideboards thick and lacquered back to cover the upper extremities. Something odd about his nose, too: a flatfish look to it, as if Nature had pushed it back a little too far, and his nostrils were too large and flaring. And then those arcing eyebrows over deep-sunken, jet-black eyes ... those eyes that were Milan\u0027s most startling feature. Jet-black, and yet Hinch couldn\u0027t be certain. Catch them at the right angle, they\u0027d sometimes gleam a golden, feral yellow. And despite the nose, still those eyes loaned Milan the looks of a bird of prey.\n But handsome? Maybe Hinch was all wrong about that. It was simply the attraction of Milan\u0027s odd - his strange or foreign, his almost alien - features, that was all. And as for Mediterranean: well, that didn\u0027t seem quite right either, not with the cold pallor of his flesh, and the blood red of his lips. He was something of a weird one, this Milan, for sure. Something of an enigma. An unknown or unspecified quantity.\n \u0027Payment when the job is done,\u0027 Milan spoke again, the rumble lower than ever. \u0027Which it isn\u0027t, not quite, not yet.\u0027\u0027What?\u0027 Hinch stared hard at him, tried to look hard, too - difficult with a man as sure of himself as Milan. Or as sure of his filthy money! But Hinch reckoned that for all his lousy millions, still Milan would be a cinch in a fight. Hinch was a powerful, brutal fighter, the victor of a dozen rough-house brawls. And Milan - he had the hands of a pianist, fingers like a girl! Hw^/Hinch would bet his life that Milan had never felt a bunch of knuckles bouncing off that ugly nose of his. And the thought never occurred to him that he had already bet his life.Cocking his head a little on one side, Milan looked at him curiously, sighed and said, \u0027First it\u0027s my music, and then it\u0027s because you\u0027ve had to work late into the night, and now ... now it\u0027s personal, to the point that you insult me and even measure your physical strength against mine, like an opponent... as if you could ever be an opponent. Or is it all just jealousy?\u0027And suddenly it sank into Hinch\u0027s less than enormous brain that while he\u0027d thought all of these things, he hadn\u0027t actually voiced any of them - not even about the music! Was he that easy to read?But he was tired of all this, and so, changing the subject he said, \u0027What\u0027s that about the job not being finished? I mean, you wouldn\u0027t be trying to avoid paying me - would you?\u0027 And the threat in his words, the way he growled them, was obvious.\u0027Not at all,\u0027 Milan told him. \u0027Payment is most certainly, very definitely due. And you shall have it. But out there - on the outside of the dome, just a little to the left of this open window here - there\u0027s a spot you missed. And I suffer from this affliction: I can\u0027t deal with too much sunlight. My eyes and my skin are vulnerable. And so, you see, while sunshine may find my window, it must never find me. The work must be finished, to my satisfaction. That was our contract, Mr Hinch.\u0027God damn this weird bastard! Hinch thought, as he paced to the window, leaned out (but carefully,) and looked to the left. But: \u0027God?\u0027 said Milan, from close behind. \u0027Your god, Mr Hinch? Well, if there is such a Being - and if his sphere of influence is as extensive as you suppose - I think you may safely assume that he \"damned\" me a very long time ago.\u0027\u0027Eh?\u0027 said Hinch, looking back into the dome, surprised by and wondering at the sudden change in Milan\u0027s tone of voice. Milan moved or flowed closer; his slim fingers were strong where they came down on Hindi\u0027s hand, trapping it on the window sill. And leaning closer still, with his face just inches away, he smiled and hissed, \u0027You don\u0027t much care for heights, do you, Mr Hinch? In fact you care for them even less than you care for me, or for my music.\u0027\u0027What the bloody ... ?\u0027 Hinch looked into eyes that were no longer black or feral but uniformly red, flaring like lamps.\u0027\u0027Bloody?\u0027 the other repeated him, his voice a phlegmy gurgle now, full of lust, and his breath a hot, coppery stench in Hindi\u0027s face. \u0027Ah, yesssss! But not your blood, not this time, Mr Hinch. Your blood is unworthy. You are unworthy!\u0027\u0027Jesus Christ!\u0027 Hinch gasped, choked, tried to draw away -and failed.\u0027Call on who or whatever you like.\u0027 Milan continued to pin him to the window ledge, and moved his free hand to the back of Hinch\u0027s thick neck. \u0027No one and nothing can help you now.\u0027\u0027You\u0027re a fucking madman!\u0027 Hinch jerked and wriggled, but he couldn\u0027t pull free. The other\u0027s strength was unbelievable.\u0027And you ... you are nothing!\u0027 Milan told him, continuing to smile, or at least doing something with his face.\n Hinch saw it, but didn\u0027t believe it: the way Milan\u0027s lips curled back and away from his elongating jaws, the teeth curving up through his splitting gums, his ridged, convoluted nose flattening back, while his nostrils gaped and sniffed. And the red blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.\n Then Milan freed Hinch\u0027s hand in order to clench his fist andhit him in his ribs - such a blow that Hinch, burly as he was, was lifted from his feet. At the same time, Milan hoisted him by the scruff of the neck and tilted him forward; concerted movements designed to topple him into space.And as the shrieking Hinch flipped out into the night, so the Thing that looked like a man released him.Hinch fell, but only for a moment. Then his shriek became a gasp as he came down on his belly and cracked ribs across the safety rail of a painter\u0027s platform slung between twin gantries. From above, seven or eight feet to the open window, Hinch heard Milan\u0027s cursing. And struggling to his feet inside the platform he looked up - to see that hideous, livid face looking down on him!Then, moving like liquid lightning, Milan was up onto the window ledge, and light as a feather came leaping to the bouncing, rocking platform. His intentions were unmistakable, and as he landed Hinch went to kick him in the groin. Milan caught his foot, twisted it until the ankle broke, then reached out with a long arm to grab the other\u0027s throat. And without pause, lifting Hinch bodily into the air, he thrust him out beyond the rim of the safety rail - and let him fall.As Hinch fell - grasping at thin air and failing to catch it - he was aware that Milan was speaking to him one last time. But whether it was a physical voice he heard, a chuckling whisper in his head, or simply something imagined, he couldn\u0027t have said. And he certainly didn\u0027t have time to worry about it.\n Paid in fully the crazed voice whispered. For your insults if not for your work. So be it!\n And below, crashing down head first, Hinch was dead before the pain had time to register. Like an egg dropped on the floor, the contents of his skull splattered at first. But the grey was soon drowned in a thick, night-dark pool that formed around his shattered head.While up above, that terrible face continued to smile down on him... for a little while, until Aristotle Milan\u0027s features melted back into a more acceptable form, and he gave a careless shrug, and grunted again, \u0027So be it!\u0027Then he returned to listening to his music, and no other\u0027s thoughts to disturb him now, in the solitude of a strange place in a strange land ...An \u0027unfortunate accident,\u0027 was how local newspapers would later report the matter. They also reported Milan\u0027s generous offer to pay all of the funeral expenses, and his very generous donation to Derek Hindi\u0027s widow ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-1.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
