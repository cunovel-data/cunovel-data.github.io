{"id":97216,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"A Meeting Of MindsJake was in Chopper one with Trask, Liz, Goodly, Lardis, and a pair of technicians, Jimmy Harvey and Paul Arenson. Their next stop was Alice Springs (a \u0027mere\u0027 eight hundred miles east) for refuelling. Chopper two needed an hour\u0027s maintenance and would follow on behind. As for the vehicular contingent:\u0027They\u0027re heading south for Kalgoorlie,\u0027 Paul Arenson, a gangling, blue-eyed blond of maybe thirty-three years was telling his younger colleague. \u0027From there they\u0027ll go piggyback on a freight train to Broken Hill, then back on the road again to Brisbane. All except the big artic. It has to be the Great Aussie Bight coast road for the big feller. I calculate something like two thousand three hundred miles all told. We\u0027ll be home and dry in less than five hours; that\u0027s taking it easy, including a stop to stretch our legs at Alice. But as for the lads in the big truck ... just be glad you\u0027re not one of them. Five hours for us, and three or four days for them!\u0027\\n\\n The conversation buzzed in Jake\u0027s head, singing with the vibration of the jet-copter. The airplane was safe and stable, but with its paramilitary design it hadn\u0027t been built for comfort. Jake sat on the floor in the narrow stowage area towards the tail, where there were no seats. Half-reclining, his large, angular frame was cushioned by holdalls, sausage-bags, and various packs of personal belongings, some hard and some soft; it wasn\u0027t his idea of luxury. But tired, and even hoping to get a little sleep, he repositioned himself as best he could and let the aircraft\u0027s singing soak into him.\\n\\n The \u0027tune\u0027 was much too regular for a lullaby, and snatches of muted conversation kept drifting back to him, monotone lyrics that didn\u0027t fit the music but clung like cobwebs to his thoroughly weary mind. Cocooned in this odd mix of white noise and blurred babble, gradually Jake felt himself nodding off.Liz Merrick was loosely belted into the rearmost of the seats, a gunner\u0027s swivelling bucket-seat between wide sliding doors on both sides. Her long legs were up, flopping over the gunner\u0027s arm rests; the gun itself slumped nose-down, strapped in position. Glinting a dull blue-grey, and despite its proximity to Liz\u0027s lovely body, the weapon looked sullenly impotent. But the picture Jake kept in his mind as he drifted into sleep was that of a naked Liz with the gun between her legs ...... But then he was asleep, and he was the gun between her legs! And - damn it to hell! - he wasn\u0027t fucking Liz but was facing xwsy from her out of the door. And she wasn\u0027t trying to ride him but was firing him ... her arms round his waist, with one hand massaging his balls while the other, working his rampant dick, shot burst after burst of silvery, smoking semen at nightmarish vampire shapes that flapped in the chopper\u0027s slipstream, snarling their bloodlust as they fought to get inside the plane, to get at Liz, Trask, Goodly and the others!Barely asleep, Jake jerked awake. Liz was staring at him, her cheeks flaming, mouth half-open, eyes wide. And Jake didn\u0027t need a degree in psychiatry - or in parapsychology - to understand what had happened here. Whether as a deliberate voyeur or an innocent observer, Liz had been in his mind. She\u0027d seen that last scene. And as for what it meant: that was his fear surfacing, his ongoing suspicion that Ben Trask was simply using him, now complicated by the notion that Trask was also using her as some kind of bait - like a carrot for a donkey? - to keep him happy as he plodded on. He could be right at that, or he could be wrong. But if Liz were the carrot, then what229did Trask have in mind for the stick? Everything remained to be seen.\u0027I... I...\u0027 Liz mouthed words at him - mouthed them, but nothing came out - as she quickly, self-consciously, ashamedly slid her jean-clad legs from the gunner\u0027s arm rests and sat up straighter in the bucket-seat. And:Serves you fucking right! Jake snapped back, but silently, in his head. And he knew he\u0027d reached her from the way her head jerked. And now keep the fuck out!Following which, as his anger cooled, it took some time to get back to sleep ...Snatches of conversation drifting back to him. But in his ears or in his had? Perhaps he was still on Liz\u0027s mind, and unsuspected even by the girl herself where she sat in her bucket-seat midway between Jake in stowage and the others in their seats up front, she had become some kind of mental relay station. For in the few days she had known him Liz had established something of a rapport with Jake; it was possible that the sending technique she had used to taunt Bruce Trennier had \u0027fixed\u0027 itself and was now developing more rapidly in her special mind. Maybe this was simply her way of making amends: by letting Jake in on the conversation. The conversation about him. Or was it something, or some one, else entirely?Trask\u0027s hushed voice, asking: \u0027But why him?\u0027 Lardis Lidesci: \u0027Does the why of it really matter? If Jake has been chosen, he\u0027s been chosen.\u0027And lan Goodly: \u0027There are certain similarities. Maybe we shouldn\u0027t overlook them. I\u0027m sure mental characteristics - how Jake thinks - are more important than the purely physical way he looks. When we look at him we don\u0027t see Harry, that\u0027s true, but the Necroscope was a hard act to follow. Perhaps we should give more thought as to how Harry sees him. And there are similarities.\u0027 Trask: \u0027Go on.\u0027\\n\\n Goodly: \u0027For one thing, they both lost loved ones. Both of them drowned, murdered, too.\u0027\\n\\n Trask: \u0027Granted, but that\u0027s where it ends. And as for losing a loved one, murdered, you could say the same about me. But where is Harry\u0027s humility? Where\u0027s his compassion, his warmth? This Jake ... he\u0027s abrasive, a roughneck, spoiled and wild.\u0027Goodly: \u0027A roughneck? But in the right circumstances that would be - and it already has been - a positive bonus. A rough diamond, maybe. Surely the Necroscope would know better than to choose a weakling for a job like this?\u0027Trask: \u0027But a hard man? A killer, even if he does have his reasons?\u0027Lardis: \u0027Me, I say they were good reasons. I like him! And I say it again, if he\u0027s Harry Hell-Lander\u0027s choice, that\u0027s good enough for me.\u0027Trask: \u0027And me ... well, within limits. So don\u0027t misunderstand me - I\u0027m not arguing the Necroscope\u0027s choice - it\u0027s just that I don\u0027t understand it. I have this feeling that Jake\u0027s not only fighting us but fighting Harry, too.\u0027Goodly: \u0027Oh, he is, be sure of it! But aside from his manners and tendency to aggression, there are similarities.\u0027Trask, dubiously: \u0027More similarities?\u0027Goodly: \u0027Indeed. For Harry believed in revenge, too. Don\u0027t you remember? An eye for an eye? He was just a boy when he went after Boris Dragosani. If like attracts like - mentally speaking, that is - then I can well see how Harry would be drawn to this one. And that\u0027s something else you might give some thought to: if you want Jake firmly on the team, and his mind exclusively on the job in hand, you could do a lot worse than find this man, this Luigi Castellano.\u0027Trask \u0027And then what? Let Jake go after him?\u0027Goodly: \u0027This Castellano is rubbish and should be disposed of - we\u0027re all agreed on that. I think Jake will chase him down no matter what, which makes Castellano a distraction. But if he were to be taken out .... no more distraction. And we would have Jake\u0027s gratitude.\u0027\\n\\n Trash, mildly surprised: \u0027Well now! And just listen to the cold-blooded one! But you\u0027re right, and we\u0027re checking into it. Interpol and other friends abroad. If we could just bring Castellano to justice, that might suffice.\u0027Goodly: \u0027No, it wouldn\u0027t.\u0027 (A sensed shake of the precog\u0027s head). \u0027When he is dead, that will suffice. You know as well as I do how Jake dealt with the other members of that gang. Do you really think he\u0027ll be satisfied to see their boss nice and comfortable, all warm and well fed behind bars?\u0027Lardis: \u0027Anyway, in case I haven\u0027t already said it loud or often enough, I like Jake Cutter. And so does Liz.\u0027Liz, heatedly: \u0027I do not! Well, not especially.\u0027Lardis, chuckling throatily: \u0027See?\u0027Then silence for a while, the darkness deepening, and Jake finally adrift in dreams. And a strange cold current taking him in tow, steering him to an unknown yet oddly familiar destination ...A river bank, and below its grassy, root-tangled rim, the water swirling in the eddies of a small bight. A boy, sitting on the edge and leaning forward at what seemed an unsafe angle, dangling his feet close to the slowly swirling surface. His elbows were on his knees, his hands propping his chin, and he appeared to be talking to someone. Perhaps to himself.Jake\u0027s shadow fell on him, and the boy turned his head to look up at him. He didn\u0027t seem at all surprised by Jake\u0027s presence (but then, neither did Jake). On the contrary, he smiled a pale, painful, yet appreciative greeting. \u0027Hello, there! So you came. Why don\u0027t you sit down a while and talk to me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I, er, didn\u0027t like to cut in on you!\u0027 Jake answered, not knowing what else to say. And then, because he wasn\u0027t sure what else to do, either - and wondering if he knew the other - he finally followed his suggestion, sat down, and asked him: \u0027Er, do you think it\u0027s possible we\u0027ve met somewhere before?\u0027\\n\\n Beginning to feel the strangeness of it all, he looked the boy over more closely, perhaps even warily.\\n\\n Apart from the obvious fact that the other had recently been fighting, there didn\u0027t seem to be anything especially odd about him. He could be any scruffy boy, though for some reason Jake found himself doubting that. Maybe eleven or twelve years old, sandy-haired, freckled; he wasn\u0027t skinny yet barely filled out his ill-fitting, threadbare, second-hand school jacket. The top button was absent from a once-white shirt that hung halfway out of his grey flannel trousers, and a frayed, tightly knotted tie with a faded school motto hung askew from his crumpled collar. His lumpish nose supported plain prescription spectacles, small, circular windows through which dreaming blue eyes gazed out in a strange mixture of wonder and weird expectation.\\n\\n Then, suddenly aware of Jake\u0027s inspection, the boy looked down at himself, wrinkled his nose in disgust, said: \u0027This will be the school bully, big Stanley Green\u0027s work. He\u0027s got it coming, has our Stanley. In about a year from now, or maybe two.\u0027 And his lips were thinner, tighter, more determined.There was dried blood on those lips, a gash in the corner of his mouth, but little or nothing of fear in his dreamy eyes, which were now other than dreamy and contained a certain glint. Indeed, they looked older than the rest of him, those eyes, and Jake thought there was probably a pretty mature mind in there, somewhere behind that half-haunted face. But he could never in a million years have guessed how mature - or how wise in otherworldly ways.And because the boy hadn\u0027t as yet answered his first question (as to whether or not they knew each other), Jake now felt the urge to remind and prompt him. \u0027Er, son?\u0027But he needn\u0027t have concerned himself. Obviously the other had considered Jake\u0027s earlier question, and now took his prompt into account, too.\u0027Son?\u0027 he finally repeated Jake, and cocked his young-old head on one side. \u0027And you\u0027re wondering if we know each other? Well, I\u0027ve got to answer no to both questions. Uh-uh, Jake. You and I don\u0027t know each other, not yet. And I\u0027m not too comfortable with you calling me \"son\". It\u0027s a case of - I don\u0027t know - what came first, the chicken or the egg?\u0027 There was no animosity in his reply.\u0027Eh?\u0027 Jake frowned. \u0027Someone else just bursting with riddles? I don\u0027t need that right now.\u0027\u0027But it\u0027s a hell of an adventure,\u0027 said the boy, sounding not at all like a child, despite his child\u0027s voice. \u0027Er, working them out, that is. I\u0027ve done my share of that, Jake.\u0027 Then, sitting back and gazing directly into Jake\u0027s eyes, studying his face and perhaps more than his face: \u0027So you\u0027re him. And you\u0027ve been having a hard time of it, right?\u0027\u0027Well, since you seem to understand what\u0027s going on here,\u0027 Jake answered, perhaps peevishly, \u0027why don\u0027t you tell me?\u0027 His dream might be working something out for him, resolving a problem.And the other nodded. \u0027Very well, I\u0027m telling you: you\u0027re having a hard time of it. But that\u0027s just as much your fault as mine; you have a very defensive mind. And me, I don\u0027t have much of a mind at all! Or I do, but not all in one place, not all at one time. Oh, I know - I mean, I\u0027ve known - a lot of things. But what I remember and what I\u0027ve forgotten are completely random. Like a kind of amnesia or a bad case of absent-mindedness. Except it\u0027s not. For you see, I\u0027m really not all here. Or putting it more sympathetically, all of me isn\u0027t here. Which means that while I won\u0027t get things one hundred per cent wrong, I may not get them entirely right either. That\u0027s why I need a focus. But now, since you seem determined to reject me, it looks like it may be hard for us to get along, and harder still for me to get it together. So, how long do you plan to keep slamming the door in my face, Jake?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Jake asked him then, feeling a weird tingle in his scalp, an unheard-of sensation of negative deja vu: that it wasn\u0027t him but the boy who had been here - or somewhere - before. And Jake felt he knew where he\u0027d been.\\n\\n But the other frowned and now seemed as uncertain as Jake. \u0027I ... I\u0027m all sorts of people and things,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m Alec, Nestor, Nathan, take your pick. There\u0027s something of Faethor in me, or has been, or will be. And something of me in a whole lot of people. It all depends on the time, the date, the place. And time is relative: what will be has been, ask any precog. That\u0027s why we have to be sure it works out right, don\u0027t you see?\u0027\u0027You ... you\u0027re Harry Keogh!\u0027 said Jake, shivering without knowing why - until he remembered what Harry Keogh was. \u0027You\u0027re the ghost they\u0027ve been telling me about!\u0027\u0027And you\u0027re the gadget,\u0027 said Harry.\u0027But I don\u0027t want to be!\u0027 Jake felt himself riveted to the river bank; he wanted to leap away but couldn\u0027t move. It was the dream, the nightmare - one of those nightmares - where, try as you might, you can\u0027t escape from the thing that\u0027s chasing you.I\u0027m not chasing you,\u0027 the young Harry protested. \u0027You are chasing me. Chasing me away!\u0027 And in fact he was wavering, physically (or metaphysically) wavering, his figure a mere outline, his face and form thinning towards transparency.\u0027But you\u0027re after my mind, my body!\u0027 Jake cried.The boy, the dream-Harry, the ghost (who by now was beginning to look ghostly, insubstantial as smoke) gave a desperate shake of his almost immaterial head. \u0027That\u0027s not me, Jake. It\u0027s the Wamphyri who want your mind, body and soul. I am the one - or rather we are the ones, and maybe the only ones - who might be able to stop them. So don\u0027t send me away, Jake. Don\u0027t fight me off!\u0027And suddenly Jake realized that he could, that he was actually doing it: fighting the other off, sending him away. And:\u0027I... I can, can\u0027t I?\u0027 he said, his fear retreating.\u0027You very nearly did!\u0027 said Harry, sighing as he firmed up again. \u0027Okay, so perhaps this is too strange for you, the wrong time and place, the wrong me. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d see any harm in a small boy, that\u0027s all.\u0027\u0027What, in a child who talks like a man?\u0027 Jake felt himself shivering again, but less violently. \u0027A boy whose eyes are innocent as a baby\u0027s yet old as the ages? A boy capable of metempsychosis - who\u0027s in my mind right now - while I\u0027m the helpless intended vessel?\u0027\u0027You\u0027re by no means as helpless as you think,\u0027 said Harry, perhaps admiringly. \u0027That mind of yours: stubborn as hell, with good shields you\u0027ve never had reason to use, nor even suspected you had them! Anyway, mind transference isn\u0027t something that I ... that I have in mind? I\u0027ve had my time, Jake, my lives -and I\u0027m still having them - but I do get your point. So, very well, let\u0027s try something else ...\u0027A moment ago it had been warm in evening sunlight that came in flickering beams, fanning through the trees on the far bank and setting the water sparkling out towards the middle of the river where the current ran fastest. Now, in a single instant, it was cold and dark; frost lay thick on the ground, and the river was a ribbon of ice, frozen and motionless. A full moon hung low in a windswept sky, and a trio of gardens fronted rich houses that reared to the right of Jake and the boy where they walked along the river path. Except Jake\u0027s companion was no longer a boy but a youth.\\n\\n Jake started away from the stranger - stumbled, might have fallen into frosted brambles on the overgrown river bank - but Harry was quick to take his arm, hold him steady. \u0027It\u0027s okay,\u0027 he said, to still Jake\u0027s cry of alarm. \u0027It\u0027s a different time, that\u0027s all, an older me. But the same place, more or less. The same river. We were back there,\u0027 he thumbed the air, indicated the path behind them, \u0027a few hundred yards downriver, sitting on the bank. It was summer and I was talking to my mother when you came by. Now it\u0027s ... oh, quite a few winters later. I\u0027m a little closer to your own age now, so perhaps we\u0027ll be able to get along that much better.\u0027\\n\\n Closer to my own age? Jake thought. But you\u0027re a good deal firmer, too. That\u0027s a Ml of a strong grip you have on my arm, and how much stronger on my mind?But Harry the youth only shook his head in disappointment. \u0027Hiding your thoughts won\u0027t help. I\u0027m in here, remember? Well, at present I am, anyway, while you accept me.\u0027\u0027Jesus!\u0027 Jake gasped. \u0027It\u0027s like something out of A Christmas Carol! When I wake up, I won\u0027t believe it.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Worse still, you may not even remember it. That\u0027s why we have to get things done while we can, and hope they get fixed in your mind.\u0027\u0027Things?\u0027\u0027Until you trust me,\u0027 the other answered, \u0027until you allow me a little permanency, we\u0027ll have to move in stops and starts. We\u0027ll get nowhere until I know the whole story, and I won\u0027t be able to help you until you believe.\u0027\u0027Believe in a ghost?\u0027\u0027But I\u0027m not, not really. And Jake, you wouldn\u0027t - I mean you really wouldn\u0027t - believe how often I\u0027ve been through this before! Oh, I\u0027ve had trouble convincing others before you.\u0027While Harry talked, Jake looked him over. It was the same \u0027boy\u0027 for sure, but he\u0027d be nineteen or maybe twenty years old now. Wiry, he would weigh some nine and a half stone and stand seventy inches tall. His hair was an untidy sandy mop that reminded Jake of Glint Eastwood\u0027s in those old western movies of more than thirty years ago. But his face wasn\u0027t nearly so hard and his freckles were still there, lending him a naive and definitely misleading boyish innocence.More than any other feature, Harry Keogh\u0027s eyes were especially interesting. Looking at Jake, they seemed to see right through him (the sure sign of an esper, as Jake was now aware), as if he were the revenant, and not the reverse. But they were oh so blue, those eyes, that startling, colourless blue which always looks so unnatural, so that one thinks the owner has to be wearing lenses. More than that, there was something in them which said they\u0027d seen a lot more than any twenty-year-old has any right seeing.But still Jake felt a little easier with all of this now. After all, it was only a dream. And since this ghost, or whatever it was, was conversational, why not talk to it? Or humour it, as the case might be.\u0027So, if convincing people is as hard as you make out, why do you put yourself to the trouble?\u0027 he asked his strange companion.They had come to a halt before the gate in the garden wall of the central house. Lights in the downstairs room adjacent to the garden sent angular black shadows marching over the brittle shrubbery arid garden path ... the shadows of men, glimpsed only briefly before the patio doors were slammed and curtains jerked hurriedly across the wide windows.For a long moment Harry made no answer to Jake\u0027s question; he stood as if transfixed, looking in through the gate\u0027s horizontal bars. But the house was mainly dark, where mere chinks of light escaped at odd angles from the corners and joins of poorly-fitted curtains.Then the youth started, blinked his eyes in the pale moonlight, and breathlessly answered, \u0027Why do I keep putting myself out? That\u0027s easy, Jake. It\u0027s because I was the beginning, and I have to be the end ...\u0027 Then he gave another start, and said:\u0027We can\u0027t stay here. That house there is where I was born. My stepfather has visitors - Boris Dragosani and Max Batu - and later, I\u0027ll be visiting him, too. Tonight is the night I killed him. But there are things you mustn\u0027t see, not yet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You ... you killed him?\u0027 And now the cold that Jake felt wasn\u0027t entirely physical, if it ever had been.\\n\\n \u0027I will,\u0027 said the other. \u0027But I don\u0027t want to see it, and Idon\u0027t want you to see it. So now we have to go. Another place and time. Are you up to it?\u0027 \u0027Do I have a choice?\u0027\u0027You can always wake up, but I wouldn\u0027t advise it! It was hard enough getting into you this time. And if you\u0027re as badly frightened as - \u0027\u0027Frightened?\u0027 Jake cut him off, his pride surfacing. \u0027Maybe I am, but I\u0027m also interested - very. I want to know where this is going, want to find out what it\u0027s all about. And since they won\u0027t tell me - \u0027\u0027They?\u0027 (Harry\u0027s turn to cut in).\u0027Ben Trask and his people,\u0027 Jake answered.\u0027Ah!\u0027 said Harry, nodding his head and smiling knowingly. \u0027I might have guessed. In fact, I suppose I knew. You mentioned \"them\" before, and obviously E-Branch HQ was where I aimed you that first time, when I first became aware of you. But that was then and this is now, and we have to move on. Since this was my home for so many years, we\u0027ll probably be back. But... my timing was years off, and I can\u0027t think why. It must be my memory, which is incomplete. You see, I\u0027m incomplete! I\u0027m not entirely here. Actually, I\u0027m not entirely anywhere! It seems to be only the strongest of times and places to which I\u0027m drawn.\u0027\u0027Maybe it\u0027s a variation on the old theme,\u0027 said Jake. \u0027The killer returning to the scene - and time - of the crime!\u0027\u0027Very clever,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And you could even be right - in a way. The lure of powerful times and places. Yes, I can see that. But a killer?\u0027 He shrugged. 1 can\u0027t deny it, and I won\u0027t try to explain it, not now. It\u0027s like I said: this isn\u0027t a good time for me. So I\u0027ll ask you once again - \u0027And: \u0027Yes,\u0027 Jake nodded. Tm up to it. I think.\u0027\u0027Very well,\u0027 the other nodded. \u0027But this time I\u0027ll try for a place of innocence.\u0027\u0027Er, before we go,\u0027 Jake quickly put in, \u0027can you answer a question or two? I mean, while I\u0027m still steady on my feet?\u0027\u0027I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t asked them sooner,\u0027 Harry answered, his eyes still anxious where they peered through the bars of the gate at the house.\u0027Why me?\u0027 Jake said. \u0027Why not one of these people you seem to know so well, the E-Branch crowd? Surely they would have accepted you that much more readily. From some of the things I\u0027ve heard them say about you, they hold you in some kind of awe.\u0027\u0027But you\u0027re young,\u0027 said the other. \u0027You\u0027re strong enough to face whatever it is that\u0027s coming. Ben Trask and the others, they\u0027re old now. And they don\u0027t need - \u0027\u0027Yes?\u0027\u0027 - Redemption? No, that\u0027s not it. Let\u0027s just say they\u0027re not troubled. They\u0027re straight in what they have to do. But you are troubled. There\u0027s a lot of anger in you, Jake, an explosive strength. And that\u0027s what is needed. It\u0027s what we have to find a use for, but the right use.\u0027\u0027So I was chosen out of nothing?\u0027 Jake frowned. \u0027Because I need saving? What if I don\u0027t want saving? You see, I still have a job to do, and one way or the other I\u0027ll do it. What I\u0027m saying is you\u0027re taking a chance with me. I might not work out the way you want me to/\u0027There was a certain element of chance in it, yes/ Harry answered. \u0027But there were also things I couldn\u0027t ignore. In the Mobius Continuum, down future time-streams, I\u0027ve seen your blue life-thread crossed with the red of vampires where you\u0027re going to meet up with them. But where some of them blink out, expire, your blue thread goes on. Deja vu, Jake! I just couldn\u0027t ignore it. I want to make sure that blue thread goes on and on, that\u0027s all\u0027Bewildered, Jake shook his head. \u0027None of which makes any sense at all to me/\\n\\n \u0027But it will, when you understand the Continuum. When you command it. And when you\u0027re able to do ... other things/\\n\\n \u0027Command it? This ... this going-places thing? You\u0027re saying there\u0027s some kind of order to it? I can control it?\\n\\n And as for doing other things: frankly, that worries me. You\u0027re beginning to sound a lot like these E-Branch people/\u0027How\u0027s your math?\u0027 The other turned his back on the house, looked out over the star-shot river of ice.\u0027My math?\u0027 Jake\u0027s bewilderment grew apace.\u0027Your numbers, your reckoning/\u0027I don\u0027t get short-changed, if that\u0027s what you mean/\u0027We should talk to Mobius/ said Harry. \u0027Except we can\u0027t, for he\u0027s long gone. That\u0027s a problem. So I suppose you\u0027ll have to learn it parrot-fashion. From me. And that could be a problem in its own right, because what I do now is pretty much instinctive, intuitive/\u0027And not very accurate/ said Jake. \u0027And probably dangerous, too. What good\u0027s all this jumping about if it doesn\u0027t get you where you want to go?\u0027\u0027But it does/\u0027But not this time!\u0027 Jake waved a hand at the house. \u0027You said so yourself/\u0027Uh-uh/ Harry shook his head. \u0027You\u0027re all confused. You keep forgetting that this is only a dream - and your dream at that! I can guide these subconscious thoughts of yours, I can aim them, but I\u0027m not flying you. I\u0027m just the co-pilot. Deep inside you want to know about me, my times, places, and history. That\u0027s what\u0027s driving all of this, your need to know. So give me a little help to move on, won\u0027t you? I can\u0027t concentrate to best effect in this location. I\u0027m not at all comfortable here/\u0027You didn\u0027t need help the first time/ Jake reminded him, \u0027when you moved us from daylight to night, from the river bank to this place, and - \u0027\u0027 - And when you didn\u0027t expect it/ the other pointed out. \u0027But it\u0027s this mind of yours. It resists me - resists psychic or metaphysical interference - and its resistance grows stronger all the time. Maybe that\u0027s another reason why I was drawn to you: because you were a rare one with a talent of your own, if not all your own, just waiting to be developed. In fact a great many people have one sort of ESP-ability or another; in most of them it\u0027s usually stillborn, incapable of further development. But I suspect that as esper begets esper the powers of the mind will come more and more into their own. Evolution, Jake: that was how it happened to me, and also how it happened in Sunside. Szgany shields are powerful, too. They have to be, or the Szgany would be extinct. In you it was dormant, waiting for an opportunity to break out. But now that it has been awakened - perhaps by contact with me, my dart - or then again by E-Branch ...\u0027\u0027Your dart? That really was you, then?\u0027 Jake was managing to absorb some of this, at least.\u0027Part of me, something of me. Awareness, Jake, awareness! Do you know the easiest way to magnetize a piece of iron? You throw it in with a lot of big magnets, that\u0027s how. And as for you - \u0027\u0027I was thrown in at the deep end,\u0027 said Jake.The other nodded. \u0027Apparently. So now if you\u0027ll only relax a little, we\u0027ll move on.\u0027And Jake relaxed ...\\n\\n To anyone else these time and location shifts might be unnerving: from a summer day on the river, to a moonlit winter night, to a night-light in a tiny garret room. Unnerving even if they worked as intended, but this time it seemed something had gone wrong. For in the little room where the dreamer now found himself he was on his own and there was no sign of his host. (His ghost?) But Jake - one of those rare types who can often distinguish between dreams and reality - wasn\u0027t too concerned. If anything he was pleased. Or rather he was glad on the one hand (for the dream had been getting out of hand) and a little disappointed on the other. Just when he\u0027d thought he was getting somewhere, learning something ...\\n\\n But you still are, said Harry.Startled, Jake looked all about. But he looked too quickly and saw nothing. And at the same time it dawned on him that he hadn\u0027t so much heard Harry\u0027s voice as felt it. \u0027Telepathy?\u0027 he said. \u0027Does that mean you didn\u0027t make it? In which case, where the hell are you?\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027m over here, said Harry. Sucked into the most innocent of places. Innocent for the time being, anyway.The \u0027over here\u0027 was a direction-finder as clear as and clearer than any voice. And now that Jake looked again he saw what he\u0027d missed the first time: a cot, standing on rockers in the corner of the small room, where the eaves came down low. And lowering his head a little, he stepped towards it.Within the cot, an infant; the baby had kicked himself free of a soft woollen blanket, lay naked and chubby, exposed except for diapers. His face was angelic, and his eyes - \u0027You!\u0027 said Jake.Different times, different Harry Keoghs, said the other.\u0027But a baby, you?\u0027Well, I was, once upon a time! But what you\u0027re looking at ... no, it isn\u0027t me. On the other hand, I am in here. For this is a time when I was incorporeal, Jake, and my son\u0027s mind was like a black hole. It sucked me in, saved me until I could become someone else.\u0027He ... he has your eyes,\u0027 said Jake, because there was no other way to answer what he\u0027d just heard. And yet it did ring a bell, for lan Goodly had tried to tell him something similar.He has my mind, too! Harry told him, gurgling happily - or unhappily? - in his cot. His and mine both. And unless I\u0027m mistaken we\u0027ve arrived at a very bad time.\u0027What, again?\u0027I was looking for innocence and found it. But if I\u0027m right, that\u0027s just about to end. You see, this is the time, almost to the moment, when Harry Jr moves on, becomes The Dweller. Which in turn means - A woman\u0027s voice cried out from an adjacent room in the garret flat. A cry of uttermost terror! But:Don\u0027t panic, said Harry, despite that his own mental voice was filled with urgency now. That\u0027s his mother, but things are well under control. And we\u0027re almost out of here. Before that, though ... Jake, I need the names of these invaders, the creatures I\u0027ve seen crossing your life-thread in Mobius time. If you know who they are, I can probably trace their histories to discover their weaknesses, maybe work out some way for you to deal with them.(Sounds of crashing furniture came from the other room, and a single shrill cry: No!\u0027 Followed by a dull thud, a low moan, and silence ... for a moment. Then a padding, and a hoarse, low panting. Sounds such as an animal might make. A large animal.)Their names! cried Harry in Jake\u0027s mind.\u0027Names?\u0027 Jake answered, his eyes on the door where it stood slightly ajar. \u0027Lords Malinari and Szwart, and the Lady Vavara: Wamphyri out of Starside.\u0027 He might just as easily have uttered an invocation.Almost wrenched from its hinges, the door crashed inwards, and in a moment Jake\u0027s dream became a shrieking, hellish nightmare! \u0027What... ?.\" he gasped. And:Yulian Bodescu! the Necroscope\u0027s revenant sighed in Jake\u0027s mind.\\n\\n The thing framed in the doorway was or had been a man; it wore a man\u0027s clothing and stood upright, however forward-leaning. Its arms were ... long! And the hands at the ends of those arms were huge and clawlike, with projecting nails. The thing\u0027s face was something unbelievable. It could have been the face of a wolf, but it was almost hairless and there were certain anomalies that suggested a bat-like origin. The monster\u0027s ears grew flat to the sides of its misshapen head; they too were bat-like and projected higher than the rearward-sloping, elongated skull. Its nose - or rather its snout - was mobile, wrinkled, convoluted, with black and gaping nostrils. The thing\u0027s skin was ridged, looked scaly; its yellow, crimson-pupilled eyes were deep-sunken in black sockets. And as for its jaws, its teeth!\\n\\n The creature - Yulian Bodescu? - ignored Jake, loped tothe cot, and crouched over it. And the light in his or its eyes had the glow of molten sulphur, the fires of hell fuelled by eager anticipation! Taloned hands were already reaching for the helpless infant as Jake tried to snatch at a gun that was no longer there. Uttering a strangled curse, he leaped to the attack ... or would have, except his limbs seemed locked in place.\\n\\n A nice gesture, but useless, Harry told him. And anyway, in the waking world it would only serve to get you killed! This is a scene from my past, Jake. Obviously we survived it, myself and my son both, but I fancy your dream won\u0027t. So one last word before we part: next time, try to be easier to reach ...\\n\\n The scene warped, began to melt away even as Jake strove to move his body - a single muscle, a fingertip - and failed miserably. He stood poised, inert, desperate to go to the infant\u0027s aid despite what the Necroscope had told him. He tried to shout a warning, managed a hoarse croak, a clotted gurgle, and all in vain. For everything was dissolving away. Terror, utter horror, can bring a man awake even when he knows he\u0027s onlydreaming.The last thing Jake saw before he surfaced was the beast: on its knees beside the cot, mad with frustrated rage, tearing the bedclothes to shreds. But of the baby Harry himself, nothingat all...And Jake gave a small glad cry and woke up. For somehow in the moment before waking he knew - he\u0027d been given to know - where the infant had gone.Along the Mobius route to E-Branch, of course.Where else? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-17.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) \\n Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
