{"id":97224,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"SynchronicityLiz was leaning over him again. \u0027Remember what?\u0027 she said.\u0027Eh?\u0027 Jake blinked sleep out of his eyes, groped to brush grit from their corners.\u0027You were rambling on about having to remember something,\u0027 she told him. And while he was ordering his thoughts to frame a reply, she quickly went on: \u0027And before you ask - no, I wasn\u0027t snooping on you. I came back here to give you a shake; you were mumbling, and I thought you were speaking to me.\u0027 Well, he hadn\u0027t been, but he had been speaking to someone. Harry? Korath? But who the hell was Korath? The name, so familiar one minute, was already meaningless, slipping from the edge of his mind. So that now, just a moment later, Jake wasn\u0027t sure it meant anything at all.Well, get sure!... get sure!... get sure! (Like an echo, fading in his memory.) And numbers - a swirl of numbers, equations, symbols, like a mathematician\u0027s nightmare - all collapsing to a big Zero, nothing, where before they had meant something. \u0027Numbers/\u0027 Jake croaked, forcing the word out of his dehydrated throat. Liz handed him a can of Coke that she was drinking from, and he sat up and swilled his mouth out, then let the fizzing liquid burn and cool and sting all the way down. \u0027Numbers?\u0027 Liz repeated him. \u0027What about them?\u0027 Awake now, he frowned at her. \u0027Are you sure you weren\u0027t in there with me?\u0027 Then, seeing that look on her face: \u0027Okay, okay! Just checking.\u0027 He took another swig, climbed unsteadily to his feet. \u0027I think I was dreaming about - hell, I don\u0027t know - all sorts of stuff He looked at his boots, then stooped to touch the bottoms of his jeans and wondered why he thought they might be wet. \u0027I can\u0027t remember. A damp place? Voices? Numbers?\u0027But Liz only shrugged. \u0027You tell me,\u0027 she said, and turned away so that he wouldn\u0027t see the look she flashed at the others up front. And over her shoulder she told him, \u0027We\u0027re on our way down. Brisbane next stop.\u0027Ben Trask, Lardis, Goodly and the others were looking at Jake where he worked the stiffness from his joints and followed Liz to her gunner\u0027s chair. As she strapped herself in, he indicated the gun ports and asked: \u0027Is it okay to open one of these up? And which side is Brisbane?\u0027One of the technicians answered him: \u0027Sure - you can open the doors. But you better hook yourself up first. Brisbane\u0027s to port.\u0027 There were safety straps dangling from the ceiling. Jake pulled one down, hooked it to his belt, jerked on the port-side door\u0027s handle, and slid the door open. Air blasted in, the downdraught from the big fan, and immediately the whup, whup, whup of the rotors was a deafening throb.Liz hooked up, joined him at the door. \u0027Have you been here before?\u0027 she inquired, but her words were whipped away. It made no difference; he \u0027heard\u0027 her anyway. And answered:No, I haven\u0027t. And you\u0027re getting good at that.She only looked at him and said, But I\u0027m not a natural - not at sending, not yet anyway - so maybe you\u0027re the one who\u0027s getting good at it. No. He shook his head to give his thoughts emphasis. It\u0027s all you, Liz. It\u0027s your talent, getting stronger all the time. And maybe some kind of rapport we seem to be developing. Which was the closest he had yet come to admitting any kind of serious involvement. Their eyes met, locked just for a moment, and each of them knew that the same thought was in the other\u0027s mind: that out of the blue Jake was accepting telepathy that much easier - as if he\u0027d been getting in some practice. And they both knew where he had been getting it. It was as he\u0027d explained to Lardis: sleep, the subconscious mind, was a strange thing. And dreams could be stranger yet. Sometimes they could even be more than dreams.Then they looked down on a small airfield six hundred feet directly below them, and, two or three miles to the east, central Brisbane.Brisbane was big and sprawling, but it didn\u0027t lack order. On the contrary, for if anything it was too symmetrical, ultra-modern. Its streets were too broad, with too many parks, pools, green areas. It should have looked as cool and fresh as an oasis, which in all this heat, when even the downdraught of the rotors felt as hot as hell, would have seemed very welcoming. But the river, instead of being a fat, winding silver eel, was more a thin, snakelike whiplash. Most of the pools were empty down to their liners, and all of the green places had yellow tints.Jake frowned and might have commented, but the horizon was rapidly narrowing down. As they watched, Brisbane came up level, finally disappearing behind the airport buildings. And just a moment or two later they bumped down.When the rotors went into braking mode, their whine became unbearable. Grimacing, Jake slammed the door to shut it out...The small airport - more an airstrip, really - belonged to a private flying club for well-to-do members of Brisbane society. The chopper\u0027s pilot had been directed to it by air traffic control, who in turn had taken their orders from higher authority. It might seem odd if a paramilitary jet-copter was seen to land at a main international airport... especially carrying the E-Branch contingent, whose members were by now beginning to look something less than reputable. Trask had radioed ahead before decamping on the other side of the continent; discreet arrangements had been made while the chopper was still in the air. Met by a pair of clean-cut, immaculately-uniformed \u0027chauffeurs,\u0027 the drivers of limos with one-way-glass windows, Trask and his people were soon on their way into the city. As they left the airport, heading for a main arterial road, they passed a small parking lot. Sitting on the hood of a battered blue-grey Range Rover-styled vehicle, a tall, angular male figure in jeans, open-necked shirt and broad-brimmed hat gazed intently into the sky over the airport through a pair of binoculars. With his hat shading his face, his features were blankly anonymous under the brilliance of the mid-afternoon sunlight. Except to Liz, there seemed nothing special about him. Liz had noticed him. She\u0027d seen how, at the last minute, before the car threw up a screen of dust in their wake, the man had turned his binoculars on the two vehicles. Now, with a frown, she tapped Trask on the shoulder where he sat in front of her.\u0027That man back there/ she said, hurriedly. They were negotiating a bend and the parking lot was already disappearing in the driver\u0027s rearview. Trask turned his head, looked back where Liz was indicating; he saw nothing but a dust-plume and a distant shimmer of heat-haze.\u0027A man?\u0027 he said. \u0027What about him?\u0027The intercom was on, and the chauffeur - a special agent - asked, \u0027Something suspicious, miss? A man, did you say? Back there? What was he doing?\u0027\u0027Sitting on a car,\u0027 Liz answered. \u0027He was watching the sky through binoculars.\u0027\u0027A plane-spotter?\u0027 Through the plate-glass screen that divided them, they saw the driver shrug. \u0027A wannabe fly-boy member of the club. Hull Some hope. Flying is for rich folks.\u0027But Liz leaned forward and quietly, right in Trask\u0027s ear, said, \u0027The last thing I saw, he was looking at us.\u0027They were turning onto the main road and picking up speed. \u0027Let it go,\u0027 Trask told her. \u0027It may have been nothing, and in any case it\u0027s too late now. If we\u0027ve been made we\u0027ve been made. But if we\u0027ve been made, then obviously someone was sent to make us - sent by someone. Now all we have to do is find out who and where.\u0027Liz nodded, said: \u0027And ... he was wondering about us.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s all you got?\u0027\u0027Yes.\u0027Trask shrugged, but not negligently. \u0027Maybe he was simply curious. But by the same token maybe this wasn\u0027t as discreet as it might have been. Two chauffeur-driven limos, doing reception at a small, private airport? I mean, turn the situation around and I might be curious myself. Do you think you\u0027d recognize him again?\u0027\u0027Probably,\u0027 she answered. \u0027There was something unpleasant, spidery about him.\u0027\u0027Well, if you do see him let me know,\u0027 said Trask. \u0027Once is coincidence. Twice ... this spider might need stepping on.\u0027 And the cars sped for the near-distant city ...Back at the parking lot, the long thin man got into his car and called a number on his portaphone. A disinterested female voice said, \u0027Xanadu, reception?\u0027\u0027I want to speak to Milan,\u0027 the thin man told her.There was a pause and she said, \u0027Your identification?\u0027 Now she was a little more animated.\u0027Mind your business/ the thin man replied, with the emphasis on \u0027mind\u0027, but with nothing of rebuke or unpleasantness in his voice. It was simply a code.\u0027Just a moment, sir,\u0027 said the girl. And the phone played some indifferent Musak. While he waited, the thin man coughed to clear his throat, mopped sweat from his brow, got his thoughts in order. His employer - Mr Milan, to whom he was about to make report - had a liking for ordered minds; he much preferred to hear and understand things clearly and precisely the first time around. And in a little while: \u0027Milan speaking/ a deep, accented, seemingly cultured yet vaguely threatening male voice replaced the Musak. \u0027What do you want?\u0027And the thin man told his employer what he had seen of the jet-copter, gave him brief descriptions of the people he\u0027d seen getting into limos outside the flying club\u0027s main building, and closed by saying: \u0027They drove off towards Brisbane.\u0027There was a brief pause before the other queried: \u0027And you didn\u0027t follow them?\u0027\u0027It was the chauffeurs/ the thin man answered. \u0027They were too good to be true. No one looks as neat, tidy, and as cool as they looked - not in this weather - without they\u0027re trying real hard. They looked like government men. And if they were, they\u0027d be on me like flies on shit as soon as they spotted me in their rearviews/\u0027I see/ said the foreign, Mediterranean-sounding voice of Mr Milan. And in a moment: \u0027Would you know these people again?\u0027\u0027Sure.\u0027 \u0027Good. I think this may be what I\u0027ve been waiting for. You can call your other observers off, Mr Santeson. Let them report to you in Xanadu. From now on I think you will find your duties more to your liking up here at the resort. Just be sure to come and see me as soon as you get in/ \u0027I\u0027m on it/ the thin man said. And under his breath, when the phone went dead: \u0027What are you - some kind of mind-reader? But anyway, you\u0027re right - that\u0027s just exactly what I wanted to hear after a day spent sweltering in all this heat, sweating my balls off, watching, waiting, and trying not to look suspicious. Shitty work, in weather like this. But up there at the Pleasure Dome .. / ... Up at the Pleasure Dome, he thought, putting the car in first and turning out of the parking lot, life is sheer luxury! The pools, the broads in their bikinis, the good food and drink - even the casino, huh! - where I can spend my money almost as fast, or faster, than Mr fucking Milan pays me! And he grinned. But on the other hand, no one could call Milan mean. Garth Santeson, a private investigator for twenty years and then some, had never had it so good. What? Milan, mean? No way! Shady, definitely - how else would you describe a guy who only ever comes out at night? But never mean - hell, no! The way Aristotle Milan throws money around, it\u0027s like ... like tomorrow there\u0027ll be no use for it!Never knowing just how close he had come to the truth, and in more respects than one, Santeson headed his battered vehicle for the ring road south around Brisbane. Then he would look for the signpost for the town of Beaudesert, which would put him on a heading for the Macpherson Range right on the border with New South Wales. Eighty miles of good road, and he\u0027d be up into the mountains, yes. And finally Xanadu ...On the way into town, Jake said, \u0027Now I remember!\u0027\u0027What you were dreaming about?\u0027 said Lardis Lidesci.\u0027Eh?\u0027 Jake looked at him.\u0027On the plane, you were dreaming about something. When Liz woke you up you couldn\u0027t remember.\u0027Jake shook his head. \u0027No, not that,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m talking about Brisbane - I\u0027m remembering about this place. Looking down on the city from the chopper, I thought it looked too neat, too new. Well, that\u0027s because it is new.\u0027 Jake and Lardis were travelling in the first limo with the team\u0027s top technicians, a pair of young, whizz-kid computer and communications types who were fully-fledged members of E-Branch but not espers as such. One of these, Jimmy Harvey - a compact, prematurely bald man of perhaps twenty-six, with lush red sideburns and bushy eyebrows that together were trying hard to make up for his baldness, grey, watery eyes, and a genius for electronics - wanted to know: \u0027Jake, where have you been hiding out these last three or four years? I mean, on the Richter Scale of national disasters, Brisbane\u0027s Great Fire of 2007 ranks several notches higher than the sinking of the Titanic, and very nearly as high as Krakatoa!\u0027 There was little or nothing of sarcasm in Harvey\u0027s comment, just surprise.Jake sighed, shrugged apologetically, and said, \u0027Yes, that was what I remembered. As for where I\u0027ve been: mainly I\u0027ve been doing my own thing. My world has been - I don\u0027t know - kind of a small place, for a long time. I\u0027ve only had room for personal problems, things that I need to get sorted out.\u0027\u0027Aye,\u0027 Lardis grunted. \u0027Your vow! I can understand that.\u0027\u0027My vow?\u0027 Jake frowned at him. As usual, he found the old boy full of indecipherable statements. But now:\u0027In Sunside,\u0027 Lardis deciphered, \u0027when a man has something to do - a wrong that needs righting - he makes a vow, usually in public. And he holds to it until it\u0027s done. I made just such a vow one time, and it still isn\u0027t done. But if I can\u0027t be killing the blood-sucking bastards there, at least I\u0027m helping to kill them here.\u0027Jimmy Harvey, despite that he wasn\u0027t privy to Jake\u0027s past, believed he\u0027d got the drift of it. \u0027So how about you, Jake?\u0027 he said. \u0027You mentioned things you \"need\" to get sorted out: present tense. So like Lardis, you\u0027re not finished yet, right?\u0027\u0027Not quite, no,\u0027 Jake shook his head. \u0027But there\u0027s plenty of time yet.\u0027 And to change the subject: \u0027Why don\u0027t you tell me about Brisbane, fill in whatever it is I\u0027ve missed?\u0027The other wasn\u0027t about to start prying; the one thing he\u0027d learned in his time with the Branch was that these people hated to talk about their private lives almost as much as about their weird \u0027talents\u0027. And as far as their powers were concerned: the majority didn\u0027t see them as bonuses at all, just extra baggage. Jake hadn\u0027t been around too long and was a new one on Harvey. Still, he was on the team and so must be an esper. Well, no one can be expert in everything. But... the Great Fire of Brisbane? Something like that had escaped his notice? Jake had to be pulling his leg. But he didn\u0027t look like he was. And so:\u0027It was about this time of year,\u0027 Harvey started out. \u0027And what do you know, 2007 was another El Nino year, just like this one - synchronicity, or something! Anyway, these freaky weather years have been coming around far too often. 1997 - 98, and again in 2002, and finally in 2007. And this current one, of course.\u0027In an El Nino the currents in the Pacific go all to hell. They circulate the wrong way, or something like that. The water gets warm where it should be cold, and vice versa. Since everything is connected to ocean temperatures - like, you know, the ecosystem? - the weather goes to hell in a bucket. Everywhere, everything, and everyone gets affected.\u0027Add to this the depletion of the rain forests, soil erosion, acid rains, holes in the ozone, the not-so-gradual melting of the ice caps, earthquakes, volcanoes blowing their tops left, right and centre ... the whole thing seems symptomatic of planetary and climatic upheaval. Or maybe I should say \"seemed\", past tense, because these aren\u0027t just symptoms I\u0027m talking about but the actual disease. In short, we\u0027re in it up to our necks! And finally people are beginning to sit up and pay attention to the ecologists and environmentalists, the guys who used to get tagged as sensationalists and doomsayers.\u0027Back around 1997 - 98 was when it became really noticeable. Now, hey, we\u0027re only talking a time-span of maybe twelve or thirteen years here, but the speed at which things have changed you really wouldn\u0027t know it. Like, a thousand years worth of climatic damage packed into just a decade and a half?\u0027So, let\u0027s go back to the years leading up to and including 1997 and \u002798. \u0027The Antarctic pack ice had already started breaking into icebergs bigger than large English counties. There were grasses and mosses and flowers where before there\u0027d only ever been ice. Similarly, in the Arctic, the sea ice was getting thinner every year, the so-called \"permanent\" ice simply wasn\u0027t permanent any more, and the cap in general was shrinking. So, all that water had to go somewhere, right? My guess: into the air, the atmosphere, Jake. And as the old saying goes, what goes up must come down again - in precipitation. And brother, did we get rain! \u0027The Netherlands: flooded to hell... so badly that for a while it looked like all the major dams would go. Germany, and Poland: all the rivers breaking their banks. Greece: unseasonal hail, with hailstones as big as ping-pong balls that flattened the crops. The USA: Jesus, the Mississippi! All that water trying to get out of there, and God help anything that got in its way! And in \u002797, right here in Australia: first they had fires that scorched people out of their homes - destroying thousands of acres of prairie, woodlands, and national parks, and killing people, livestock, wildlife galore - and then monsoon rains to match anything the rest of the world had suffered. It was just crazy fucking weather!\u0027But the hell of it was, these were only warnings. The El Nirios are warnings; the melting ice is a warning, and likewise the ozone layer. Like planet-wide alarms that have been sounding for a long, long time, all in vain because no one has been listening. Or rather, no one was listening to the ones who were listening ... \u0027In the Far East, they wouldn\u0027t stop burning the rain forests. The Americans took the hump when people said their carbon dioxide emissions were off the scale ... but they weren\u0027t half as snooty in the summer of \u002798 when Texas turned into a desert! Heat wave? They\u0027d never seen anything like it! As for the Russians: well as usual they hid or disguised or denied any and all wrongdoings whatsoever. Huh! What else would you expect of the people who turned the Aral Sea into the Aral Pond ... the folks with more toxic nuclear and chemical garbage per acre than most countries have per square mile! In E-Branch - during my three years with the Branch, anyway - we\u0027ve been monitoring the hell out of the Russians. Ask Ben Trask about it some time.\u0027 And Jake cut in, \u0027Well, at least I know something about all that: the way they dump their clapped-out subs, et cetera.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s part of it,\u0027 Harvey agreed, \u0027but the rest of it is just as bad. Anyway, all that\u0027s away from the main subject, and in fact we were talking about - ?\u0027 \u0027 - The big fire,\u0027 Jake reminded him. \u0027Until you went a bit off track.\u0027Harvey nodded. \u0027Yeah, the Great Fire of Brisbane, 2007. It was around this time of year, and El Nino was up to its unusual tricks. The weather had been freakish everywhere, especially in the UK, England. For fifteen years the various water boards had been moaning about declining water tables. It could rain all it wanted during the winter, but given just three days of good old heartwarming sunshine in July and these jokers would start leaping up and down, and tearing their hair, and sticking in meters and standpipes, and demanding that people should save water by cutting down on their bathing and putting bricks in their water closet cisterns ... and so on, and so forth, ad infinitum. What a load of crap, zfyou could afford to take one! It was Nature all those years, warning us that the Big One was coming.\u0027Well, in 2007 in England it came, and that year we didn\u0027t have a summer ...\u0027\u0027It was washed out?\u0027 Jake felt obliged to ask. \u0027It was drowned out!\u0027 Harvey told him.\u0027I seem to remember something about that,\u0027 Jake said. \u0027But I missed it. I was on the Continent.\u0027 \u0027But you must have read about it, seen it on TV?\u0027 \u0027I told you, I was doing my own thing. On the Continent.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Harvey agreed. \u0027About the only place in the world where the weather was moderately normal. You were lucky. But in England it rained, and rained, and rained! And as for declining water tables: forget it. There\u0027s been no shortage of water ever since. Anywhere below sea level turned into a swamp. The Thames Barrier failed, and high tides combined with a flooded river to drown the city six feet deep. Through July, August, and September - shit, there were gondolas in Oxford Street! Okay, so I\u0027m exaggerating - maybe it wasn\u0027t quite as bad as all that, but it was bad enough. And I could go on and on. Except ...\u0027 He paused again. \u0027Except that was the UK,\u0027 Jake helped him out. \u0027And thepeople had plenty of warning, and there was little or no loss of life. Yes, I remember it now. But we were talking about Brisbane, not quite so close to home.\u0027\u0027Not just Brisbane,\u0027 the other told him. \u0027In 2007 it was Australia as a whole. Now, you\u0027ve got to remember that in Australia the climate works backwards to how we\u0027d expect back home. It\u0027s way hotter in January than in July: the difference between summer and winter, right? Oh, really? Well, in 2007 everything went wrong. From February on the summer weather held, there was no winter and it didn\u0027t get any colder. Just like now, in fact exactly like now, they had the freakiest of freak weather.\u0027Turning his head, Harvey gazed out through the limo\u0027s one-way windows at suburbs becoming city. \u0027I mean, just take a look out there.\u0027Jake looked, lifted an enquiring eyebrow. \u0027Well?\u0027\u0027Dry, brittle, parched. Those gardens that should be green are more like miniature deserts. The grass is withered to straw and the leaves are dead on the trees and bushes. Almost all the swimming pools are empty, and you won\u0027t see anyone watering any lawns. It should be a maximum of sixty, sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit out there, but it\u0027s well over eighty, and this is late afternoon. And naturally, it\u0027s an official drought. Perfect!\u0027\u0027Perfect for what?\u0027 Now Jake was really puzzled ... not to mention tired of this circuitous route they were taking to the Great Fire. \u0027Earth Year!\u0027 said Harvey. \u0027The big conference that starts tomorrow right here in Brisbane, billed as the ultimate ecological summit meeting. Synchronicity at work again, or maybe not. Naturally they chose this place, because of the fire.\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027ve lost me again,\u0027 Jake told him. \u0027And we still haven\u0027t got to the fire itself.\u0027 The other shrugged apologetically. \u0027I\u0027m sorry - it\u0027s this grasshopper mind of mine. Start me on a subject, it devours me. Okay, the fire: \u0027It was the weirdest thing ever - a one-of-a-kind sort of thing, or at least everyone hopes so. 2007, and we thought we\u0027d seen it all: the worst tornadoes the USA had ever suffered, the worst floods, the strangest fluctuations and reversals of climate right across the world, with Australia taking the brunt of it. But no, we hadn\u0027t seen it all.\u0027Brisbane was like a tinderbox. The whole east coast from Rockhampton to Canberra - normally a green strip in the lee of the Great Dividing Range, with no water shortage and an excellent annual rainfall - was bone dry from this drought that had lasted for eighteen months. Oh, they\u0027d had rain, but all of it had fallen on the wrong side of the Great Divide! And daily the temperature was up in the hundreds.\u0027And it was then that it happened. It was like ... what, a tornado? An almighty tornado, a whirlwind, yes. But a whirlwind of fire! Ma Nature, Jake, getting all hot under the collar. It started in the Gidgealpa and Moomba oil and gas fields, but how or why it started, no one knows. There are various theories but, like I said, no one really knows. Though miles apart, suddenly the oil wells and gas installations became the epicentre of an enormous fireball. That in itself was a disaster, but nothing like what was to come. \u0027A fireball, vast, hot, rushing up on its own thermals, and sucking in the air to fuel itself; sucking the air into a self-perpetuating spiral, a superheated whirlwind. It swept east out of the Sturt Desert, its base widening out as it came, a column of fire five and then ten miles across. At more than a hundred miles an hour it hit a place called Dirranbandi and burned the entire town, just took it out. And everything it burned fuelled the fire, that got hotter and hotter. And on it came. The thing moved like a drunkard - never in a straight line but just exactly like a tornado - a pillar of fire reaching up through the clouds. \u0027Of course it was monitored, thousands of people reported seeing it. It came terrifyingly close to some towns, scorching them but leaving them intact; then again it seemed to swoop on others, tossed them into the sky in blazing rags. Firefighters tried to plot its course from the air; some airplanes flew too close and got sucked in, incinerated. And rotating ever faster, it rushed east to refuel itself on the Alton oil field ... \u0027So it goes, and I can\u0027t remember all of it. But who would want to? Anyway, the whole thing was on every TV channel. Every Aussie there ever was watched it happening, couldn\u0027t do a thing about it. The authorities thought the mountains would stop it - they were wrong. It blazed across the Divide, leaving a smoking track twelve miles wide in its wake, with secondary fires still ranging outwards. The latter would burn for weeks until torrential rains stopped them. \u0027And with only an hour\u0027s warning to the people of Brisbane - an indefinite warning at that, for no one could say for sure what this thing would do - finally it hit, this firestorm from hell, such as the world had never before seen. Never before and never since, thank God! \u0027Everything that could burn burned. If it couldn\u0027t burn it calcined. And if it couldn\u0027t calcine it melted. As for the Brisbane River: forget it. It was running at a trickle and had been for a nine-month. The firestorm took what was left of the river water, turned it to steam in a couple of seconds and kept right on going.\u0027And that was it: a one-hundred-miles-per-hour blast furnace had killed a city and everyone it it who couldn\u0027t or hadn\u0027t tried to get out following the warning. They hadn\u0027t all died by burning; a great many people, gone underground or into cellars, suffocated because the fire needed their air. All of it. Then:\u0027The thing hit the sea and sucked up a waterspout into its raging funnel. The water put the fire out, turned to steam, and formed clouds. The clouds drifted inland and rained on the raging inferno that had been Brisbane. Finally it was over. End of story ...\u0027... And after a while:\u0027Christ!\u0027 Jake said, under his breath. And a moment later: \u0027That is some encyclopedic memory you\u0027ve got there, Jimmy. What are you, an authority on world disasters?\u0027Harvey shrugged a little self-consciously - perhaps sheepishly? - and said, \u0027Me? No - but I know a woman who is. Before we broke camp, I had to talk to HQ about a couple of communications problems. Millicent Cleary was on Duty Officer. She\u0027s our current affairs lady; she has that kind of memory, keeps a mental record of just about everything that\u0027s going or gone down. As lan Goodly knows the future, she knows the recent past; but of course she has a big advantage: like, it\u0027s already happened. And unlike lan\u0027s her knowledge comes in amazing detail. So when I told her we\u0027d be setting up next in Brisbane, she clued me in on the city, the fire, the Earth Year Conference. And there you have it: the fire\u0027s still fresh in my mind from my conversation with Millicent Cleary.\u0027Harvey sat back and looked out of his window. After a moment\u0027s silence he said, \u0027But actually, I wish it wasn\u0027t...\u0027In the other limo, the episode of the tall, thin plane-spotter (if that was what he had been) had been forgotten by everyone except Liz Merrick. She, too, was trying to put it to the back of her mind, but knew she\u0027d be able to recall it if or when it was required - - His silhouette etched on her memory: his angular shape. And the tilt of his broad-brimmed hat, that kept the sun out of his eyes. The way his binoculars were trained on ... trained on what, a mainly empty sky? That was what had been bothering her! That, and the way those glasses had suddenly dipped., turning towards the limo.That was when Liz\u0027s mind had been closest to his, themoment when she\u0027d sensed his interest in the vehicle and itsoccupants ...\u0027So how about it?\u0027 said Ben Trask, causing her to start as hereached over her and switched off the intercom connection totheir driver. \u0027Eh?\u0027 she said. And: \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry, Ben. I must have been daydreaming. How about what?\u0027 \u0027Jake, on the chopper. What was going on? Did you get anything?\u0027 And now the image of the thin man with the binoculars vanished completely from her mind as the other question arose, the one Liz had known she would have difficulty answering. At first it had seemed simple, even exciting in a strange and morbid sort of way. The answer to not just one question but many. But after thinking it over she had seen the enormous hurt it might cause, so that now she had to find a way around it. If Trask would let her.\u0027But I thought we had an understanding on that,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t like spying on Jake, and - \u0027\u0027What?\u0027 He cut her off. \u0027But on the chopper you seemed to indicate that you\u0027d got something. So why are you holding back, Liz? What the hell is going on here?\u0027 The look on Trask\u0027s face was one of incredulity; he\u0027d been sure they\u0027d hammered this out and from now on it would be plain sailing. So what had happened to change her mind?\u0027I ... I\u0027m not sure what I got!\u0027 she blurted it out, lying so unconvincingly that even without his talent Trask would have known. And she saw in his eyes that he knew, and in the way his lips tightened. \u0027But ... but he\u0027s my partner!\u0027 She quickly went on the defensive. \u0027He\u0027s got to be able to trust me. He saved my life, and - \u0027\u0027Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake spare me!\u0027 Trask barked. But before he could say anything else:\u0027Damn you!\u0027 Liz snapped. And then more quietly, even desperately: \u0027Can\u0027t you see? I\u0027m trying to spare you, Ben!\u0027Which set him back a little, because he saw that that was the truth, too. And despite that Trask was still frowning, his tone was less severe when he said: \u0027All right, so don\u0027t try so hard.\u0027And after a moment, when she remained silent, he went on, \u0027Look, whatever this is, there\u0027s only you, me, and lan here to share it. So let\u0027s have it out in the open here and now, while we can still deal with it in private. For if it has to do with me - and if it\u0027s got anything at all to do with the Branch or the job in hand - then obviously I have to know.\u0027\u0027But it\u0027s so very little,\u0027 she answered. \u0027And his shields were up, like a blanket covering his mind, and - \u0027\u0027Liz, I have to know!\u0027 Trask insisted. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter how small a thing it might seem to you, it could be all-important to everyone else.\u0027\u0027In its way, I\u0027m sure it is/ Liz said. \u0027It\u0027s just that I would have liked to find a way to tell you - I mean a different way to tell you - without this.\u0027\u0027This what?\u0027 said Trask. \u0027And Liz, if you lie to me again I\u0027ll know.\u0027She looked at him, looked at lan Goodly, sighed and shook her head. \u0027I didn\u0027t want to lie, but I didn\u0027t want to hurt you either. You see, it\u0027s .where Jake was - in his dream, I mean - and it\u0027s who he was speaking to.\u0027\u0027Go on,\u0027 Trask nodded.\u0027He was down in the wrecked sump of the Romanian Refuge,\u0027 she blurted it out. \u0027But Ben, it had to be much more than just a dream because from what I saw of it - despite that it was so dark and shrouded - it was all so very real.\"\"The Refuge?\u0027 Trask repeated her. \u0027Jake dreamed he was in the wrecked sump? And he was ... speaking to someone?\u0027\u0027To more than one,\u0027 Liz corrected him. And now that she\u0027d got started, she quickly went on, \u0027But you know how dreams are supposed to happen in the last few minutes before you wake up? Well, not this one. It started the moment he fell asleep, went on until he woke up. And it was more than just a dream, Ben.\u0027The other\u0027s face was grey now, gaunt with the sudden, sure knowledge of what Liz was about to tell him. He knew, but asked her anyway. \u0027Who was Jake talking to?\u0027 \u0027To Harry Keogh,\u0027 she answered, \u0027and to someone else who I didn\u0027t know and don\u0027t want to know, ever. I couldn\u0027t read him - he was a complete blank - but I could sense his presence like a sick taste in my throat. And just the opposite to him, a little earlier there\u0027d been a third presence like ... like a breath of fresh air. She was someone I\u0027d never known, who I wish I had.\u0027\u0027It was Zek!\u0027 Trask groaned. \u0027He was talking to Zek. Jake was talking to Zek, through Harry.\u0027 And clasping Liz\u0027s hands in his: \u0027Liz, what was she saying? What did Zek say?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she shook her head, wanted to put her arms round him but couldn\u0027t for fear it would crack him up. And anyway, they wouldn\u0027t be Zek\u0027s arms. \u0027I got something of what Jake was saying - though very little, because he didn\u0027t say much - but nothing of what the others actually said. That was a void.\u0027 lan Goodly said, \u0027Of course it was. You heard Jake because he\u0027s alive. That was your telepathy working, Liz. But Harry and the others ... they\u0027re a different category, and they were in a different mode.\u0027\u0027Deadspeak, yes,\u0027 Trask murmured, gaunt and visibly shaken where he let his head flop back against the seat\u0027s headrest and closed his eyes. \u0027And whether I like it or not, it looks like I now have to accept it. Jake is our new Necroscope, and Harry is introducing him to ... to people who\u0027ll be able to help him. As for this numbers thing that Jake was talking about when he woke up - the difficulty he seemed to be having - I think that can mean only one thing.\u0027Trask looked at the precog and Goodly nodded his confirmation. \u0027Despite that Jake\u0027s future is beyond me, uncertain now,\u0027 he said, \u0027still I can only go along with you. It was the Necroscope\u0027s sidereal maths, his numbers, that gave him the edge. And now it looks like the old master is trying to teach his apprentice the tricks of the trade ...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-25.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires.
