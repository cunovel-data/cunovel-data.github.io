{"id":97221,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"A Dark Lady ... and a Darker Lord\u0027Fuelled by blood, Nephran Malinari\u0027s bloodwars were a terrible scourge on humanity/ Korath picked up the threads of his story. \u0027For as long as he ravaged on Sunside to provision fortress Malstack, so must the rest of the Wamphyri forage, lest Malinari\u0027s army so outstrip theirs as to whelm them under. Thus the Szgany suffered as never before - at least, not for sixty thousand sunups - \u0027 (twelve hundred years) \u0027since the mythic and immemorial time of Shaitan the Unborn\u0027s great wars, before he was unseated and banished north to the Icelands. \u0027The Mind\u0027s foes were many, his friends few. Even the latter were not his \"friends\" in the human sense of the word, that sort of comradeship being so rare among the Wamphyri as to be a myth in its own right! But at any rate, his dubious allies were Vavara - a Lady in all but name, for she would not accept that men call her \"Lady\" for fear it might damage her status by making her seem less than a Lord - and Szwart, which was the only name that suited a Thing such as he. Szwart, which means darkness! For indeed he was darkness, literally the darkest of all the Lords of the Wamphyri; something which I shall endeavour to explain in a little while. But for now, so much for Malinari\u0027s allies. Oh, there was a handful more, but Nephran, Szwart and Vavara (who insisted upon the status of a man despite her obvious, indeed devastating feminine charms and attributes), they were the generals, the triumvirate, the Big Three.\u0027Then there were The Mind\u0027s foes, the enemy proper; first and foremost, Drama! Doombody, the most powerful of the Wamphyri of that period. Some thirty years earlier, at the pinnacle of his power, Drama! had contracted leprosy from a comely Szgany woman in whom the disease had seeded itself but was not yet manifest; since when he had accepted to be known as \"Lord Doombody\". For, of course, his body was doomed, no matter how long it might take the great \"Bane of Vampires\" to run its course. \u0027As to Dramal\u0027s surname prior to his long-term but inevitably lethal error, I have no knowledge. But I do know that his aerie, Dramstack - one of the most massive of all the stacks - was generally avoided as a pesthole, even in my time. Nathless, before Dramal\u0027s leprosy began wearing on him - which is to say, for the duration of Malinari\u0027s war - he shared his stack with a lesser \"colleague\", Lord Zaddok Zangastari, who had the topmost ramparts and the aerie\u0027s penultimate level (called Zadscar, because it was his headquarters, and also because of its external figuration of slanting gouges) for his own. Not that Zaddok was in any way careless of his health, but this sharing was an expedience of war: since Dramstack (including Zadscar) stood close to Darkspire, Lord Szwart\u0027s manse near the centre of the clump, it were better that two armies occupy Dramal\u0027s vast aerie, thus presenting a powerful front across the dividing gulf and threatening Szwart\u0027s forces with a partial siege at least. \u0027But as for battle tactics ... I cannot admit to any great authority. These things I mention were overheard and remembered from those occasions when Nephran\u0027s war-council of three - himself, Szwart, and Vavara - met in whichever of their aeries to consider and order the ongoing hostilities. So let me not stray but get on with naming names:\u0027After Dramal and Zadok came Lord Belath, a young Lord who had just the one name, with no sire\u0027s name and no cognomen. Perhaps there was some secret in his ancestry that he did not wish divulged. As for a descriptive name or device which might best characterize him - there were some who fancied him \"Belath the Beast\", though I\u0027m certain that no one ever suggested it to his face. Need I say more?\u0027But if Belath were beastly, then what of Lord Lesk, known as Lesk the Glut? For Lesk was a young berserker, only recently ascended, who was given to abandon himself as totally in battle as in his gluttony. Easily offended, he had even been known to take umbrage at his own personal warriors! If they were idle in answering his call, Lesk would work himself into a frenzy, challenge them to combat and beat them soundly ... before returning them to their basics in his vats of metamorphism. And when his fury was in abeyance and his mood improved, then he would find time to rebuild them all over again. Thus, while The Glut could never be reckoned one of the great schemers, he was most certainly a mighty engine of destruction.\u0027Nor were the vampire Lords alone in their awful strength and monstrous habits; many of Starside\u0027s Ladies were certainly their peers in malign intent, and a deal more devious and treacherous in their scheming. Vavara, who took sides with Malinari (we shall get to her, aye), was only one such; there were plenty of others who came close equals in malevolence. For example: Lady Jemma Freydaskith, of Hagspire. \u0027But surely the name of her manse says it all! Jemma was a hag, and a lustier, more ancient, wicked and withered hag there never was! Similarly, and where the name of her aerie describes her nature, surely the Lady\u0027s surname describes its origin. For there was only ever one Freyda among the Wamphyri, and that was Freyda Ferenc in the days of Shaitan the Unborn. Jemma Freydaskith knew the myths associated with that Lady\u0027s name; she likewise associated them with her own peculiarities of habit - her idiosyncrasies? - and so claimed direct descent from that ancient line. Now normally this would be disputable; the Wamphyri were bad record-keepers; living so long (some of them), history was yesterday to them; they saw no point in looking back beyond their own immediate forebears. But Jemma was reputed to be more than seven hundred years old! Since no one else had memories of that primeval time, who was there to dispute her claim? \u0027Anyway, while true histories, pedigrees and lineages were scarcities among the Wamphyri, certain myths were such as would live forever. Just so, and the myths surrounding Freyda Ferenc - while the Lady herself was long gone into oblivion - were of that order. Obviously she had been a Ferenczy, which in itself loaned authenticity to Jemma\u0027s claim, insofar as the Ferenczys were present in every Starside myth and legend (or at least the few that existed), even the most ancient of them. And what with Jemma\u0027s - predilections? - it seemed certain that something of Freyda\u0027s blood had found its way down the ages to her.\u0027For Freyda Ferenc had been gross of face and form, a veritable troll, with the thick skin of a trog and the fangs of a warrior! Men, even the most powerful of Lords, shrank from her person (likewise from her smell: she never washed) since for her hideous pleasure she was known to suffocate male and female thralls alike with her sex! Which of itself was surely quite enough to make her a legend in her own time and a mythical figure in mine ... but there was more.\u0027Freyda was that merciful rarity: a Mother of Vampires who, when she was ripe and in her final confinement, produced an hundred eggs, being so depleted during the which that she withered to a wisp and expired. But her spawn, all save one egg, was diseased and likewise died. The lone surviver fused with Bela Manculi, a Szgany thrall, and Bela became heir to Freydastack.\u0027And so to the final proof of Jemma\u0027s lineage, if such were needed: her sire had been Lord Bela Belari, or \"Bela\u0027s son\" - an ancient in his own right - which might well make Jemma the great-granddaughter of Freyda Ferenc! Anyway, and having eschewed her father\u0027s name, \"Freydaskith\" was what Jemma had called herself for thirty-five thousand sunups, during which her life-style had more than adequately supported her claim to the noxious ancestral connection in which she revelled ...\u0027I have digressed! Yet by your silence I\u0027m encouraged that I have interested you - \u0027 - But on the other hand I sense your impatience, too, so now let me get on with it - which I would, gladly, except there is one more Lord of that era who was or is worthy of mention ... \u0027Shaitan the Unborn, before his banishment, had spread his spawn far and wide in Starside. And in those mythic times there were even Lords who were more trog than man ... which in itself speaks of Shaitan\u0027s depravity. But there again, among the Wamphyri, miscegenation, incest, bestiality, and other perversions could scarcely be considered uncommon. And anyway, who am I to criticize? For Shaitan was after all the first of all, with no one to show him the way when he strayed or say him nay when he erred.\u0027Thus, despite that he was gone, his line lived on. Bloodsons and a few -daughters bore Shaitan\u0027s name and likeness down the march of years. And each and every one of them proud of the connection, even as he had been proud in his time, with a pride that knew no shame, for which ultimately he had paid the price. But his heirs cared nothing for that, cared only that they were spawn of the spawn of Shaitan the Unborn, the first Great Vampire, the one true Lord and sire of the Wamphyri.\u0027And just as the first of his vampire progeny had borrowed from their illustrious forebear\u0027s name in the earliest days of Starside mythology (Lords and Ladies such as Sheilar the Slut, Shaithar Shaitanson, Shailar the Hagridden, Shaithag the Harrower, Shang Shaitari, and Shaithos Longarm), so in my time his descendants - or perhaps I should say descendant, for by then there was only one of \"pure\" or direct line of descent - continued this great vanity. And that one\u0027s name was Shaithis. \u0027Shaithis was a \"young\" Lord then, little more than a hundred years of age. But of course he could be as young or as old as he willed it; simply a matter of rigidly controlled metamorphism. And Lord Shaithis - who took no other name or sigil, but deemed his titular connection a blazon and statement sufficient in its own right - willed himself forever young and handsome. \u0027So he was, indeed beautiful, despite that he was as evil as any of the Great Vampires, and probably more so than most of them; and clever, too, skilled in controlling the lesser Lords, who were a rabble, adrift, and of little strategic consequence under Drama! Doombody. And not only men, but Shaithis was also good with monsters. His vats bred many a nightmarish warrior.\u0027These and other attributes of leadership were proven during the course of Malinari\u0027s bloodwar of a thousand sunups, so that Shaithis rose even to the rank of Dramal himself, becoming his right-hand man and equal. And while many Lords were lost in that holocaust of blood, Shaithis went from strength to strength, until everyone supposed he would be a Power one day ...\u0027And he probably was, but alas I was not there to see it. For my master and his allies were the losers. Malinari, Vavara, and Szwart, they were whelmed under, their great aeries sacked, their possessions looted, and their thralls and creatures converted.\u0027Well, as was the way of it in those days, they were banished north to the Icelands forever. And I, Korath Mindsthrall, my master\u0027s chief lieutenant... I went with them, of course.\u0027As to how it happened:\u0027In the beginning, Nephran Malinari was short of friends. And this had always been the case, ever since his mother Illula flew off into the sun and left him Malstack for his own. It was his weird talent that cost him the \"companionship\" of the other Lords and Ladies. They could not trust him; they even feared to be close to him, who could be into their minds so easily. Also, his stack was a mighty fortress filled with men and beasts, and it was suspected that his ambitions reached beyond his station. Which of course they did, like the ambitions of all of them who were Lords. For lust, greed, and territorialism were ever their way of life. \u0027But isn\u0027t it true that a man who cannot make friends will usually make enemies? And as easily as that, the rumours sprang up: that Malinari was searching out allies and making ready his aerie for a bloodwar to rival the mythic wars of yore. But when I say \"easily\", that is not to say quickly; I would remind you that time is of small concern to the Wamphyri, and in fact the enmity that developed between The Mind and the others took decades in its shaping.\"Thus, when Malinari ravaged among the supplicant Vadastra clan on the night that I was taken and my people destroyed, his terrible tithe-gathering venture wasn\u0027t solely of his initiation or invention; Lord Doombody was also provisioning, and likewise the rest of the vampire Lords.\u0027Aye, for the simple truth of it was that they each feared each other. And fear fuelled fear, do you see?\u0027So naturally when The Mind first observed how his mental-ist talents had isolated him, indeed he commenced searching out others who might also be under threat, to enlist their aid. Nor were they hard to find:\u0027The Lady Vavara, for one, but I use the term \"Lady\" where she would not because I have seen and been close to her; and to see her ... There never was a more perfect definition of femininity, though whether or no she affected her outward appearance (as, for instance, did Shaithis, by means of metamorphism), of that I have no knowledge. But I find it hard to ascribe so much beauty to Nature alone. Yet if she was Nature\u0027s handiwork ... then why was that work so perfected in a female of the Wamphyri? It is a paradox to which I have no answer. \u0027So, I have seen and been near her - too near and once too often, for I believe it was Vavara bade Malinari ram me in this pipe! - yet I cannot recall her clearly to memory. Perhaps that in itself defines her beauty: that its power is such as to maze common men, and no less common women. But here another paradox: for despite that she was that beautiful - a beguiler, a gorgeous witch, a sensuous sorceress - still she was unsure of herself, uncertain of her beauty. I can offer no other explanation for her habits, that a goddess (albeit a demon goddess) such as she was so offended by the concept of beauty in others that she could not bear it, and so was wont to remove the breasts, lips, noses, and other parts of her female thralls to make them ugly!\u0027There, in a nutshell, we have Vavara. And just as my vampire world was separated in two parts that were opposites, Sunside and Starside, so was she separated: her luminous exterior from the dark and swirly deeps within.\u0027She was Malinari the Mind\u0027s first choice as an ally; not because he lusted after her but because he knew that certain of the other Lords did. And Vavara had determined she would not be any Lord\u0027s woman, nor would she ever take a man until she found one who was at least her equal in desirability. An unlikely occurrence, for she was the one who had described Shaithis - generally considered godlike - as a mere \"lump\" of a man! Oh, she took men, be sure, but they were her thralls and easily disposable in the unlikely event of complications. \u0027And Vavara, too, had heard rumours of a bloodwar in the offing, and also how Lesk the Glut had been boasting of what he would do to her after he\u0027d sacked Mazemanse, her spindly, fretted, many-spired aerie where it stood not far from Malstack and Lord Szwart\u0027s Darkspire. How he would put out her ruby-red eyes to kill their fascination, singe her eyebrows, her long lashes, and the hair of her head to make her a hag, then fuck her every opening into great holes fit only for shads in the rut. Hah! So much for Vavara\u0027s \"beauty\", if Lesk the Glut had his way! Is it any wonder she sided with Malinari? \u0027And finally there was Lord Szwart. But if I have found it difficult to describe Vavara, how then shall I portray Szwart who was and still is literally indescribable? For, of course, all three of them are extant still... \u0027... I see by your silence that you would have what I know, despite that I know so little. So be it; what knowledge is mine shall be yours, no more nor less. \u0027As to who or what Szwart is: the best that I can offer - he is Wamphyri! But he is the essence of Wamphyri, distilled or filtered by the foulness of his forebears, mutated beyond recognition not by Nature but by necessity, more leech than Lord, and a fly-the-light in the fullest sense of the word.\u0027The flickering light of candles, torchlight, firelight - the light of man-made combustion - these are the only kinds of light his eyes can bear, and even then not with complete impunity. But if the light matches the fire of his eyes he is fairly safe. Brighter than that, he knows pain! And any who would give Szwart pain ... let him first pierce himself with silver dipped in kneblasch, fasten boulders to his neck, slit his wrists, and leap from the topmost battlements of the tallest aerie.\u0027 Then he might be safe from Szwart.\u0027And only let someone declare enmity towards Szwart - let him broadcast his aversions or discuss them with his peers, and then have his words find their way back to the night-black master of Darkspire - and no matter who this loudmouth might be, whether high or low in the Wamphyri pecking order, be sure that Szwart would do his damnedest to put a stop to such mutterings.\u0027Aye, and when Szwart did his damnedest... \u0027There was one Narkus Stakis, Lord of Narkslump, a collapsed pile on the western fringe of the clump, who from the onset of all the rumour-mongering and side-choosing had voiced abroad his detestation of Lord Szwart. Precisely why he held Szwart in such low esteem, who could say? Perhaps he\u0027d had wind of Lord Doombody\u0027s provisioning and other preparations for war, and the accompanying rumour that Drama! intended to root out all \"deviants\" (which is to say his enemies, real and imagined) from the ranks of the Wamphyri. \u0027If that were a fact, then the proximity of Szwart\u0027s Darkspire to DramaTs Dramstack in the core of the clump would seem certain to make Szwart just such an enemy. For if Lord Doombody wished to expand territorially (assuming that this was his real purpose) he must first annex Darkspire, Szwart\u0027s gloomy, shadow-shrouded manse across too small a gulf of air. And so, and also because Drama! controlled a large percentage of Starside power, the very inferior Narkus Stakis had determined to side with him - whether or no Dramal required him as an ally. \u0027Alas for him that he made known his decision, especially his disinclination towards Szwart...\u0027Lord Szwart was black; his aerie was black, and shadowed for the most part by mighty Dramstack; his warriors and flyers were black, and the black of night was his medium. Lord Stakis\u0027s Narkslump, more a great cleft knoll than a stack proper, stood in the western fringe of the cluster and low to the earth, and its silhouette against the northern auroras was more a ragged hump than a fang. Gloom was its constant companion.\u0027On the night that Narkus died a great drift of cloud obscured the moon and stars, and Starside was never so dark. The clouds sweeping north out of Sunside were black and swollen in their bellies, pregnant with rain that lashed at the aeries of the Wamphyri. There had been fantastic lightnings over the barrier mountains, and the wide forests of Sunside would be awash in the aftermath of the storm. Not a good night for raiding on the Szgany, not with the air full of ozone, when careless flyers and riders might so easily attract hell-fire from the sky, to singe them and send them plummeting. For which reasons most of the Lords and Ladies stayed to house. Most of them.\u0027But throughout the night several watchkeepers in aeries near the western rim, where they looked down on Narkslump\u0027s split dome, had noted how Lord Stakis\u0027s nightlights - the braziers within his battlements, behind the merlons and embrasures, and the torches in his watchtower turrets - were going out one by one, as if extinguished by the torrential rains. Except they were still going out long after the rains were done.\u0027Came morning; the Wamphyri stayed abed while the accursed sun rose up and up, to its zenith, when the spires of the highest stacks were lit by its rays, and many-layered curtains were drawn against its lethal heat. The day passed as all days must; soon it was night again, and the Lords and Ladies up and about. Lights burned in all the aeries - except Narkslump.\u0027And slow but sure the truth became known. A small handful of thrall survivors came on flyers and on foot, over the barren boulder plains to neighbouring Scarstack and Lurelodge, begging refuge from the master and mistress respectively of those middling manses. A body of men flew out from Scarstack to Narkslump and down into its landing bays. And later, in the midnight hour, they reported back to Lord Oulios the Scar on Narkslump\u0027s condition as they had found it. Also on Narkus\u0027s condition, as they had found him, his three lieutenants, and the body (or bodies?) of his thralls.\u0027Word spread swiftly abroad, to all the stacks of the Wamphyri. And now certain things were remembered from the previous night:\u0027In Dramstack, when the rains were at their worst, how the aerie\u0027s Desmodus colony was startled from its roost. A thousand great bats, all chittering and panicked for no apparent reason, whirling, colliding, and scolding where they circled the fretted ceiling of their cavern lair. And Lord Dramal Doombody, nodding in his private chambers, startled awake by confused mental messages from these bat familiars: A dark shadow - a stranger, doubtless an enemy - has passed close by. Though he was cloaked in darkness, we sensed him, his eyes burning on Dramstack. They seethed and were full of hatred! \u0027But Dramal\u0027s watchmen, huddling miserably in their draughty turrets and cold stone niches, and his flightless guardian warriors, rumbling behind the earthworks and on the boulder-strewn approaches to towering Dramstack, had seen nothing but a fleeting shadow: that of a cloud, they said. And cold, wet and dull, they failed to wonder why the shadow had sped west rather than north. \u0027And so Dramal had ordered his familiars: Go back to sleep! You nightmared. The pounding rain and lightning shook you loose from your dusty perches. No stranger is come to harm me or mine in Dramstack. \u0027Not him or his, no ...\u0027A similar disturbance had been recorded in Karl Szorkala\u0027s Karlspire. And further west, in the grounds of Lady Sasha Lureswain\u0027s Lurelodge, one of her earthbound warriors had reared up and buffeted ineffectually at a dark blur of a shape that fluttered to a landing just beyond the bounds of Sasha\u0027s demesne - in Lord Stakis\u0027s territory, aye.\u0027So to the report of them that flew from Scarstack to Narkslump, when they returned to Oulios the Scar in his high place. Narkslump was intact, as were its flyers and warrior creatures, all dutifully in their places, however nervous, unattended, and unfed. Vampire thralls, however - male and female, eunuchs and fighting men alike, some twenty in all - lay dead in their beds or at their various places of duty: in the walls and corridors, on the causeways, and in Narkus\u0027s harem. Likewise Narkus himself and his three lieutenants, all dead in their quarters.\u0027Well, Narkslump was scarcely a fortress such as towering Dramstack. And Narkus lorded it - or he had used to - over a mere dribble of men and monsters compared to the greater Lords in their lofty aeries. Even a small invasion force, if its components were stealthy and well ordered, could have infiltrated Narkslump\u0027s defences under cover of the storm. But that wasn\u0027t the way the survivors in Scarstack and Lurelodge told it.\u0027According to one of them, a sentry on the night in question: \u0027\"The night was dark and overcast; residual rain dripped from roofs, buttresses, causeways, overhangs. I was cold, wet, uncomfortable in my niche. And I admit that I stayed well back, to avoid getting wetter still. But it was also a night of shadows. When I came out one time to scan abroad, I looked down on the lower ramparts where a colleague was keeping watch. Failing to see him, I assumed that he too was avoiding the worst of the drench. But I did see a shadow - or I thought it was a shadow - that flowed swiftly along the walkway and disappeared into a niche, then returned and continued along the ramparts. A stain, a blot on the stone, a shadow, aye ... but mobile?\u0027\"There again, the clouds were fleeting and there were so many shadows, and I have only a thrall\u0027s eyes. A lieutenant\u0027s eyes might have been keener, better suited, but lieutenants do not guard the walls. My Lord Stakis\u0027s eyes would certainly have noted any weirdness or peculiarity, but he was in his chambers. \u0027 \"When next I looked out and down, my colleague\u0027s brazier was out; a hiss of steam rose up; I assumed that there had been more rain, or my friend had been negligent of his fire. And the night was even darker.\u0027 \"My duty station was lit fitfully by twin torches ensconced under slate awnings that fended off the rain. I replenished them with fresh faggots before returning to my niche and snuggling deeper yet. Time passed; perhaps I heard a grunt or call - a gurgled cry? - from the north flank. But in any case I ventured out again, to the northernmost point of my picket, where I leaned from an embrasure to look down on the adjacent flank. In the misted gloom of a landing bay, there was no watchman to be seen, but the steam of his extinguished brazier rose up!\u0027 \"It was time I made report. But only recently recruited, my vampire skills were weak; I was not yet linked to my master. If I cried out with my mind alone, Lord Stakis would not \u0027hear\u0027 my alert, and deep within the rock he couldn\u0027t possibly hear my voice. Wherefore a dilemma: should I desert my position and go to the Lieutenant of the Watch, who I knew to be a very difficult man? And if I did, and nothing was found amiss, what then? \u0027 \"I leaned out again and looked down ... and at once drew back! For traversing the scarp directly below me - coming diagonally upwards across the treacherous, rain-slick face of the rock and scarcely pausing to negotiate the way - I had spied a lumpy shadow like a dark blot against the lesser darkness. But did I say dark? The shadow was block! And where it merged with other shadows it disappeared completely, only to emerge a moment later, always climbing towards my battlements station.\u0027 \"Now I knew to run and make report - or at least to run, if nothing else! But already the shadow was stretching itself, groping like the fingers of some phantom hand towards the merlons between myself and the entrance to Narkslump\u0027s east wing. Even if I ran this unknown thing would be there first, perhaps waiting for me. Neither was there any other route of entry - nor of escape - from my position on the outer face.\u0027 \"Now, I am not a man to shrink from any normal darkness. Murky gloamings and the weird nebulosities of Sunside bogs had never frightened me. But this was no ordinary shadow. There was something sinister, knowing, clever, about it; it moved as on a mission, and in my heart I knew I couldn\u0027t stop it. Only let me try ... it would certainly stop me! But as yet it didn\u0027t even know that I was there. Or at least, I hoped that was the case.\u0027 \"And as quietly as possible I crept into my niche, drew as far back as I could go among the spiders and beetles - then farther yet until the sharp rock of the split scraped my chest and my back - and finally held still, so very still, there in the dark and the dust.\u0027 \"And eventually something came.\u0027 \"Do not ask me what it was, but it came and was a part of the darkness. And while I couldn\u0027t see it, I knew it was there. Then - \"\"\"Indeed I am here!\u0027 A voice came to me like the rustle of leaves, so close I felt the breath of it! And it continued: \u0027I see you are afraid, and that is good. Be afraid, my friend, and make no outcry. Stay here for long and long in this tight crevice, while I go about my business, and I won\u0027t harm you. But if you come out ... ah, that would be a brief but very unfortunate affair. So then, do we have an understanding?\u0027\u0027\"I could only nod, and though I saw nothing at all, still the shadow saw me. \u0027Good,\u0027 it husked, and spoke no more. \u0027 \"Then I was alone again - and pleased to be alone - for long and long ...\u0027\"... How long I cannot say. But when I dared to come out I saw that my torches were expired, and looking closer I saw they had been capped - put out - deliberately. And not only my torches but all the lights in Narkslump, till tip to toe the aerie stood in darkness most utter.\u0027\"Then when I went inside I found what I found, and discovered the hidy-holes of a handful of others with tales to tell much like my own. Following which... can you blame us that we fled that haunted place, and came with all dispatch here ... ?\"\u0027That was the thrall\u0027s story, and the other survivors with him agreed with everything he said. But survivors of what?\u0027Since the answer to Korath Mindsthrall\u0027s final question was obvious, a reply seemed unnecessary. But Harry Keogh answered him anyway, saying, Survivors of Lord Szwart, of course.Harry\u0027s words - more definite, decisive in Jake Cutter\u0027s mind - startled him from the reverie induced by Korath\u0027s narrative; from what had seemed like a dream within a dream, where everything that the ex-vampire lieutenant described had seemed as real as if Jake himself had been there, in another time and another world. And:\u0027What? Where?\u0027 Jake gave himself a shake. And looking all about he saw debris: the buckled stanchions and shattered concrete slabs fallen from the ceiling, the partly-gleaming, scorch-scarred rim of the monitor conduit rising from the sullen swirl of dark waters. That was where this fragment of the history of a vampire world had its origin: that ugly pipe where Korath had died the true death, which still contained his bones, sloughed clean and washed white by the water. And Jake shuddered.Harry sensed his unease, and asked, Are you all right? \u0027No,\u0027 Jake answered. \"And I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever be all right again.\u0027 You will lie, the other told him. You have to be. Anyway, we stillaren\u0027t through here. I want to know more about Szwart - what he is and how he came to be - and I think Korath knows it all. But I sense that he\u0027s slowing up, holding backTo which Korath immediately replied, And you are correct! For it dawns on me that I do myself no good here. When you have learned your fill, what then of me? No forgiveness, shunned by the living and the dead alike, washed away to nothing and dispersed across an alien land? Hah! Surely I can do better.You are dead, said Harry. These things are what happen to the dead, in circumstances such as yours.And Korath answered, Ah, cold, cold!No, said Harry, not entirely. Merely truthful. I won\u0027t lie to you that there\u0027s anything in this for you. Only our company, for however long it lasts.But Korath said:Yet your dead converse! I know, for I have heard them whispering in their graves. When they sense me listening, then they keep quiet or exclude me. So why can\u0027t they converse with me?They don\u0027t like you, said Harry. Can you blame them? Being dead, they hate death. And they know that you thrived on it! -I did what vampires do. Is there no pity?For you, none. Then I have none for you! Korath sulked. You dare to go up against Vavara, Szwart, Malinari? Without knowing all there is to know about them? Good luck to you. You are dead men and may think of me again some time, when you lie broken or drained, or minced into warrior feed. Then perhaps you\u0027ll wish we had spoken at greater length, but too late. Until that time you\u0027ll hear no more from me. He fell silent. But: You have no idea how weary I am of all your bluff and bluster, Harry told him. What do you expect of me? What can I possibly do for you? You are dead, Korath!You, too, Korath answered. And yet you have mobility, companionship ... a future?My case is different, said Harry. And as for the future, I never underestimate it.And Jake\u0027s case? His future? There was a slyness in Korath\u0027s deadspeak voice, and Harry didn\u0027t like it. He wondered if he detected some hidden innuendo, or more likely some kind of threat. Jake is a dreamer, he said. Right now he is no more and no less. He\u0027s my apprentice, if you like, and for the moment knows very little about such things - but he will learn. And:\u0027Huh!\u0027 Jake snorted. \u0027Even if I don\u0027t want to, it seems!\u0027Yessss, said Korath. And I can feel your apprehension. But still Harry is right and you should ... learn. If not from him, then perhaps from me?Harry was at once alarmed. You know what we want from you. And that\u0027s all we want. So what\u0027s it to bePSzwart\u0027s origins?(Harry\u0027s deadspeak nod). And more about Malinari\u0027s bloodwar - how you survived the Icelands, and how finally you came here. Korath sighed and said, Very well For I am forgiving, even if you are not. He was silent for a moment, then sighed again and said: Therest of it, then ...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11/page-22.html","bookId":2597,"book":{"id":2597,"title":"Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: Invaders (Necroscope #11) Three great vampires--two Lords and a Lady--arrive on an unsuspecting Earth that teems with defenseless humans, easy prey for the marauding vampires. But humanity has defenders. Though the necroscope is gone, the psychically gifted men and women of E-Branch move swiftly against the vampire infestation. Jake Cutter is running for his life through the streets of Turin when he vanishes, appearing moments later inside the triply locked \"Harry\u0027s room\" in E-Branch\u0027s London HQ. Jake\u0027s dreams are very strange, filled with the voices of the dead--the Great majority, the Necroscope, Harry Keogh, even a dead vampire. He hears them all, but he doesn\u0027t truly understand. If Jake is the new Necroscope, he has to learn--fast!--how to control his powers and speak to the dead. E-Branch, with the reluctant Jake along for the ride, is about to go head-to-head with Malinari the Mind, a vampire Lord who psychic abilities are second to none. But the dead don\u0027t trust Jake, not like they trusted Harry. Jake\u0027s got personal revenge on his mind, and he\u0027s spending too much time talking that dead vampire. He\u0027s got to start thinking about the future--or he won\u0027t have one!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-invaders-necroscope-11.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:57 PM"}}
