{"id":38792,"no":2,"title":"Part One Chapter 2","content":"In the month of July 1947, having saved about fifty dollars from old veteran benefits, I was ready to go to the West Coast. My friend Remi Bonc?ur had written me a letter from San Francisco, saying I should come and ship out with him on an around-the-world liner. He swore he could get me into the engine room. I wrote back and said I\u0027d be sa- tisfied with any old freighter so long as I could take a few long Pacific trips and come back with enough money to support myself in my aunt\u0027s house while I finished my book. He said he had a shack in Mill City and I would have all the time in the world to write there while we went through the rigmarole of getting the ship. He was living with a girl called Lee Ann; he said she was a marvelous cook and everything would jump. Remi was an old prep-school friend, a Frenchman brought up in Paris and a really mad guy--I didn\u0027t know how mad at this time. So he expected me to arrive in ten days. My aunt was all in accord with my trip to the West; she said it would do me good, I\u0027d been working so hard all winter and staying in too much; she even didn\u0027t complain when I told her I\u0027d have to hitchhike some. All she wanted was for me to come back in one piece. So, leaving my big half- manuscript sitting on top of my desk, and folding back my comfortable home sheets for the last time one morning, I left with my canvas bag in which a few fundamental things were packed and took off for the Pa- cific Ocean with the fifty dollars in my pocket. \n I\u0027d been poring over maps of the United States in Paterson for months, even reading books about the pioneers and savoring names like Platte and Cimarron and so on, and on the road-map was one long red line called Route 6 that led from the tip of Cape Cod clear to Ely, Nevada, and there dipped down to Los Angeles. I\u0027ll just stay on 6 all the way to Ely, I said to myself and confidently started. To get to 6 I had to go up to Bear Mountain. Filled with dreams of what I\u0027d do in Chicago, in Denver, and then finally in San Fran, I took the Seventh Avenue subway to the end of the line at 242nd Street, and there took a trolley into Yonkers; in downtown Yonkers I transferred to an out- going trolley and went to the city limits on the east bank of the Hudson River. If you drop a rose in the Hudson River at its mysterious source in the Adirondacks, think of all the places it journeys by as it goes out to sea forever--think of that wonderful Hudson Valley. I started hitch- ing up the thing. Five scattered rides took me to the desired Bear Mountain Fridge, where Route 6 arched in from New England. It be- gan to rain in torrents when I was let off there. It was mountainous. Route 6 came over the river, wound around a traffic circle, and disap- peared into the wilderness. Not only was there no traffic but the rain came down in buckets and I had no shelter. I had to run under some pines to take cover; this did no good; I began crying and swearing and socking myself on the head for being such a damn fool. I was forty miles north of New York; all the way up I\u0027d been worried about the fact that on this, my big opening day, I was only moving north instead of the so-longed-for west. Now I was stuck on my northernmost han- gup. I ran a quarter-mile to an abandoned cute English-style filling station and stood under the dripping eaves. High up over my head the great hairy Bear Mountain sent down thunderclaps that put the fear of God in me. All I could see were smoky trees and dismal wilderness rising to the skies. \"What the hell am I doing up here?\" \n I cursed, I cried for Chicago. \"Even now they\u0027re all having a big time, they\u0027re doing this, I\u0027m not there, when will I get there!\"--and so on. Finally a car stopped at the empty filling station; the man and the two women in it wanted to study a map. I stepped right up and ges- tured in the rain; they consulted; I looked like a maniac, of course, with my hair all wet, my shoes sopping. My shoes, damn fool that I am, were Mexican huaraches, plantlike sieves not fit for the rainy night of America and the raw road night. But the people let me in and rode me north to Newburgh, which I accepted as a better alternative than being trapped in the Bear Mountain wilderness all night. \"Besides,\" said the man, \"there\u0027s no traffic passes through 6. If you want to go to Chicago you\u0027d do better going across the Holland Tunnel in New York and head for Pittsburgh,\" and I knew he was right. It was my dream that screwed up, the stupid hearthside idea that it would be wonderful to follow one great red line across America instead of trying various roads and routes. \n In Newburgh it had stopped raining. I walked down to the riv- er, and I had to ride back to New York in a bus with a delegation of schoolteachers coming back from a weekend in the mountains--chatter- chatter blah-blah, and me swearing for all the time and the money I\u0027d wasted, and telling myself, I wanted to go west and here I\u0027ve been all day and into the night going up and down, north and south, like some- thing that can\u0027t get started. And I swore I\u0027d be in Chicago tomorrow, and made sure of that, taking a bus to Chicago, spending most of my money, and didn\u0027t give a damn, just as long as I\u0027d be in Chicago tomor row. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/157.html","bookId":295,"book":{"id":295,"title":"On The Road在路上","description":"简介： 《在路上》主人公萨尔为了追求个性，与迪安、玛丽卢等几个年轻男女沿途搭车或开车，几次横越美国大陆，最终到了墨西哥，一路上他们狂喝滥饮，高谈东方禅宗，走累了就挡道拦车，夜宿村落，从纽约游荡到旧金山，最后作鸟兽散。同时，书中体现了作者主张的即兴式自发性写作...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12854026083d944.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
