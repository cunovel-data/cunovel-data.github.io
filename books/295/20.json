{"id":38810,"no":20,"title":"Part Two Chapter 6","content":"It was drizzling and mysterious at the beginning of our journey. I could see that it was all going to be one big saga of the mist. \"Whooee!\" yelled Dean. \"Here we go!\" And he hunched over the wheel and gunned her; he was back in his element, everybody could see that. We were all delighted, we all realized we were leaving confusion and non- sense behind and performing our one and noble function of the time,move. \n And we moved! We flashed past the mysterious white signs in the night somewhere in New Jersey that say SOUTH (with an arrow) and WEST (with an arrow) and took the south one. New Orleans! It burned in our brains. From the dirty snows of \"frosty fagtown New York,\" as Dean called it, all the way to the greeneries and river smells of old New Orleans at the washed-out bottom of America; then west. Ed was in the back seat; Marylou and Dean and I sat in front and had the warmest talk about the goodness and joy of life. Dean suddenly became tender. \"Now dammit, look here, all of you, we all must admit that everything is fine and there\u0027s no need in the world to worry, and in fact we should realize what it would mean to us to UNDERSTAND that we\u0027re not REALLY worried about ANYTHING. Am I right?\" We all agreed. \"Here we go, we\u0027re all together ... What did we do in New York? Let\u0027s forgive.\" We all had our spats back there. \"That\u0027s behind us, merely by miles and inclinations. Now we\u0027re heading down to New Orleans to dig Old Bull Lee and ain\u0027t that going to be kicks and listen will you to this old tenorman blow his top\"--he shot up the radio vo- lume till the car shuddered--\"and listen to him tell the story and put down true relaxation and knowledge.\" \n We all jumped to the music and agreed. The purity of the road. \n The white line in the middle of the highway unrolled and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove. Dean hunched his muscular neck, T-shirted in the winter night, and blasted the car along. He in- sisted I drive through Baltimore for traffic practice; that was all right,except he and Marylou insisted on steering while they kissed and fooled around. It was crazy; the radio was on full blast. Dean beat drums on the dashboard till a great sag developed in it; I did too. The poor Hudson--the slow boat to China--was receiving her beating. \n \"Oh man, what kicks!\" yelled Dean. \"Now Marylou, listen real- ly, honey, you know that I\u0027m hotrock capable of everything at the same time and I have unlimited energy--now in San Francisco we must go on living together. I know just the place for you--at the end of the regu- lar chain-gang run--I\u0027ll be home just a cut-hair less than every two days and for twelve hours at a stretch, and man, you know what we can do in twelve hours, darling. Meanwhile I\u0027ll go right on living at Camille\u0027s like nothin, see, she won\u0027t know. We can work it, we\u0027ve done it before.\" It was all right with Marylou, she was really out for Camille\u0027s scalp. The understanding had been that Marylou would switch to me in Fris- co, but I now began to see they were going to stick and I was going to be left alone on my butt at the other end of the continent. But why think about that when all the golden land\u0027s ahead of you and all kinds of unforeseen events wait lurking to surprise you and make you glad you\u0027re alive to see? \n We arrived in Washington at dawn. It was the day of Harry Truman\u0027s inauguration for his second term. Great displays of war might were lined along Pennsylvania Avenue as we rolled by in our battered boat. There were 6-295, PT boats, artillery, all kinds of war material that looked murderous in the snowy grass; the last thing was a regular small ordinary lifeboat that looked pitiful and foolish. Dean slowed down to look at it. He kept shaking his head in awe. \"What are these people up to? Harry\u0027s sleeping somewhere in this town ... Good old Harry ... Man from Missouri, as I am ... That must be his own boat.\" Dean went to sleep in the back seat and Dunkel drove. We gave him specific instructions to take it easy. No sooner were we snoring than he gunned the car up to eighty, bad bearings and all, and not only that but he made a triple pass at a spot where a cop was arguing with a motorist--he was in the fourth lane of a four-lane highway, going the wrong way. Naturally the cop took after us with his siren whining. We were stopped. He told us to follow him to the station house. There was a mean cop in there who took an immediate dislike to Dean; he could smell jail all over him. He sent his cohort outdoors to question Marylou and me privately. They wanted to know how old Marylou was, they were trying to whip up a Mann Act idea. But she had her marriage certificate. Then they took me aside alone and wanted to know who was sleeping with Marylou. \"Her husband,\" I said quite simply. They were curious. Something was fishy. They tried some amateur Sherlock- ing by asking the same questions twice, expecting us to make a slip. I said, \"Those two fellows are going back to work on the railroad in Cali- fornia, this is the short one\u0027s wife, and I\u0027m a friend on a two-week vaca- tion from college.\" \n The cop smiled and said, \"Yeah? Is this really your own wallet?\" Finally the mean one inside fined Dean twenty-five dollars. We told them we only had forty to go all the way to the Coast; they said that made no difference to them. When Dean protested, the mean cop threatened to take him back to Pennsylvania and slap a special charge on him. \n \"What charge?\" \n \"Never mind what charge. Don\u0027t worry about ithati, wise-guy.\"We had to give them the twenty-five. But first Ed Dunkel, that culprit, offered to go to jail. Dean considered it. The cop was infuriated; he said, \"If you let your partner go to jail I\u0027m taking you back to Penn- sylvania right now. You hear that?\" All we wanted to do was go. \"Another speeding ticket in Virginia and you lose your car,\" said the mean cop as a parting volley. Dean was red in the face. We drove off silently. It was just like an invitation to steal to take our trip-money away from us. They knew we were broke and had no relatives on the road or to wire to for money. The American police are involved in psy-chological warfare against those Americans who don\u0027t frighten them with imposing papers and threats. It\u0027s a Victorian police force; it peers out of musty windows and wants to inquire about everything, and can make crimes if the crimes don\u0027t exist to its satisfaction. \"Nine lines of crime, one of boredom,\" said Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line. Dean was so mad he wanted to come back to Virginia and shoot the cop as soon as he had a gun. \n \"Pennsylvania!\" he scoffed. \"I wish I knew what that charge was! Vag, probably; take all my money and charge me vag. Those guys have it so damn easy. They\u0027ll out and shoot you if you complain, too.\" There was nothing to do but get happy with ourselves again and forget about it. When we got through Richmond we began forgetting about it, and soon everything was okay. \n Now we had fifteen dollars to go all the way. We\u0027d have to pick up hitchhikers and bum quarters off them for gas. In the Virginia wil- derness suddenly we saw a man walking on the road. Dean zoomed to a stop. I looked back and said he was only a bum and probably didn\u0027t have a cent. \n \"We\u0027ll just pick him up for kicks!\" Dean laughed. The man was a ragged, bespectacled mad type, walking along reading a paperbacked muddy book he\u0027d found in a culvert by the road. He got in the car and went right on reading; he was incredibly filthy and covered with scabs. He said his name was Hyman Solomon and that he walked all over the USA, knocking and sometimes kicking at Jewish doors and demanding money: \"Give me money to eat, I am a Jew.\" \n He said it worked very well and that it was coming to him. We asked him what he was reading. He didn\u0027t know. He didn\u0027t bother to look at the title page. He was only looking at the words, as though he had found the real Torah where it belonged, in the wilderness. \n \"See? See? See?\" cackled Dean, poking my ribs. \"I told you it was kicks. Everybody\u0027s kicks, man!\" We carried Solomon all the way to Testament. My brother by now was in his new house on the other side of town. Here we were back on the long, bleak street with the railroad track running down the middle and the sad, sullen Southerners loping in front of hardware stores and five-and-tens. \n Solomon said, \"I see you people need a little money to continue your journey. You wait for me and I\u0027ll go hustle up a few dollars at a Jewish home and I\u0027ll go along with you as far as Alabama.\" Dean was all beside himself with happiness; he and I rushed off to buy bread and cheese spread for a lunch in the car. Marylou and Ed waited in the car. We spent two hours in Testament waiting for Hyman Solomon to show up; he was hustling for his bread somewhere in town, but we couldn\u0027t see him. The sun began to grow red and late. \n Solomon never showed up so we roared out of Testament. \n \"Now you see, Sal, God does exist, because we keep getting hung-up with this town, no matter what we try to do, and you\u0027ll notice the strange Biblical name of it, and that strange Biblical character who made us stop here once more, and all things tied together all over like rain connecting everybody the world over by chain touch ... \" Dean rattled on like this; he was overjoyed and exuberant. He and I sudden- ly saw the whole country like an oyster for us to open; and the pearl was there, the pearl was there. Off we roared south. We picked up another hitchhiker. This was a sad young kid who said he had an aunt who owned a grocery store in Dunn, North Carolina, right outside Fayetteville. \"When we get there can you bum a buck off her? Right! Fine! Let\u0027s go!\" We were in Dunn in an hour, at dusk. We drove to where the kid said his aunt had the grocery store. It was a sad little street that dead-ended at a factory wall. There was a grocery store but there was no aunt. We wondered what the kid was talking about. We asked him how far he was going; he didn\u0027t know. It was a big hoax; once upon a time, in some lost back-alley adventure, he had seen the grocery store in Dunn, and it was the first story that popped into his disordered, feverish mind. We bought him a hot dog, but Dean said we couldn\u0027t take him along because we needed room to sleep and room for hitchhikers who could buy a little gas. This was sad but true. We left him in Dunn at nightfall. \n I drove through South Carolina and beyond Macon, Georgia, as Dean, Marylou, and Ed slept. All alone in the night I had my own thoughts and held the car to the white line in the holy road. What was I doing? Where was I going? I\u0027d soon find out. I got dog-tired beyond Macon and woke up Dean to resume. We got out of the car for air and suddenly both of us were stoned with joy to realize that in the dark- ness all around us was fragrant green grass and the smell of fresh ma- nure and warm waters. \"We\u0027re in the South! We\u0027ve left the winter!\" Faint daybreak illuminated green shoots by the side of the road. I took a deep breath; a locomotive howled across-the darkness, Mobile- bound. So were we. I took off my shirt and exulted. Ten miles down the road Dean drove into a filling-station with the motor off, noticed that the attendant was fast asleep at the desk, jumped out, quietly filled the gas tank, saw to it the bell didn\u0027t ring, and rolled off like an Arab with a five-dollar tankful of gas for our pilgrimage. \n I slept and woke up to the crazy exultant sounds of music and Dean and Marylou talking and the great green land rolling by. \"Where are we?\" \n \"Just passed the tip of Florida, man--Flomaton, it\u0027s called.\" Flor- ida! We were rolling down to the coastal plain and Mobile; up ahead were great soaring clouds of the Gulf of Mexico. It was only thirty-two hours since we\u0027d said good-by to everybody in the dirty snows of the North. We stopped at a gas station, and there Dean and Marylou played piggyback around the tanks and Dunkel went inside and stole three packs of cigarettes without trying. We were fresh out. Rolling into Mobile over the long tidal highway, we all took our winter clothes off and enjoyed the Southern temperature. This was when Dean started telling his life story and when, beyond Mobile, he came upon an ob- struction of wrangling cars at a crossroads and instead of slipping around them just balled right through the driveway of a gas station and went right on without relaxing his steady continental seventy. We left gaping faces behind us. He went right on with his tale. \"I tell you it\u0027s true, I started at nine, with a girl called Milly Mayfair in back of Rod\u0027s garage on Grant Street--same street Carlo lived on in Denver. That\u0027s when my father was still working at the smithy\u0027s a bit. I remem- ber my aunt yelling out the window, \u0027What are you doing down there in back of the garage?\u0027 Oh honey Marylou, if I\u0027d only known you then! Wow! How sweet you musta been at nine.\" He tittered maniacally; he stuck his finger in her mouth and licked it; he took her hand and rubbed it over himself. She just sat there, smiling serenely. \n Big long Ed Dunkel sat looking out the window, talking to him- self. \"Yes sir, I thought I was a ghost that night.\" He was also wonder- ing what Galatea Dunkel would say to him in New Orleans. \n Dean went on. \"One time I rode a freight from New Mexico clear to LA--I was eleven years old, lost my father at a siding, we were all in a hobo jungle, I was with a man called Big Red, my father was out drunk in a boxcar--it started to roll--Big Red and I missed it--I didn\u0027t see my father for months. I rode a long freight all the way to California, really flying, first-class freight, a desert Zipper. All the way I rode over the couplings--you can imagine how dangerous, I was only a kid, I didn\u0027t know--clutching a loaf of bread under one arm and the other hooked around the brake bar. This is no story, this is true. When I got to LA I was so starved for milk and cream I got a job in a dairy and the first thing I did I drank two quarts of heavy cream and puked.\" \n \"Poor Dean,\" said Marylou, and she kissed him. He stared ahead proudly. He loved her. \n We were suddenly driving along the blue waters of the Gulf, and at the same time a momentous mad thing began on the radio; it was the Chicken Jazz\u0027n Gumbo disk-jockey show from New Orleans, all mad jazz records, colored records, with the disk jockey saying, \"Don\u0027t worry about inothingi!\" We saw New Orleans in the night ahead of us with joy. Dean rubbed his hands over the wheel. \"Now we\u0027re going to get our kicks!\" At dusk we were coming into the hum- ming streets of New Orleans. \"Oh, smell the people!\" yelled Dean with his face out the window, sniffing. \"Ah! God! Life!\" He swung around a trolley. \"Yes!\" He darted the car and looked in every direction for girls. \"Look at iheri!\" The air was so sweet in New Orleans it seemed to come in soft bandannas; and you could smell the river and really smell the people, and mud, and molasses, and every kind of tropical exhala- tion with your nose suddenly removed from the dry ices of a Northern winter. We bounced in our seats. \"And dig her!\" yelled Dean, pointing at another woman. \"Oh, I love, love, love women! I think women are wonderful! I love women!\" He spat out the window; he groaned; he clutched his head. Great beads of sweat fell from his forehead from pure excitement and exhaustion. \n We bounced the car up on the Algiers ferry and found our-selves crossing the Mississippi River by boat. \"Now we must all get out and dig the river and the people and smell the world,\" said Dean, bus- tling with his sunglasses and cigarettes and leaping out of the car like a jack-in-the-box. We followed. \n On rails we leaned and looked at the great brown father of wa- ters rolling down from mid-America like the torrent of broken souls-- bearing Montana logs and Dakota muds and Iowa vales and things that had drowned in Three Forks, where the secret began in ice. Smoky New Orleans receded on one side; old, sleepy Algiers with its warped woodsides bumped us on the other. Negroes were working in the hot afternoon, stoking the ferry furnaces that burned red and made our tires smell. Dean dug them, hopping up and down in the heat. He rushed around the deck and upstairs with his baggy pants hanging halfway down his belly. Suddenly I saw him eagering on the flying bridge. I expected him to take off on wings. I heard his mad laugh all over the boat--\"Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!\" Marylou was with him. He cov- ered everything in a jiffy, came back with the full story, jumped in the car just as everybody was tooting to go, and we slipped off, passing two or three cars in a narrow space, and found ourselves darting through Algiers. \n \"Where? Where?\" Dean was yelling. \n We decided first to clean up at a gas station and inquire for Bull\u0027s whereabouts. Little children were playing in the drowsy river sunset; girls were going by with bandannas and cotton blouses and bare legs. Dean ran up the street to see everything. He looked around; he nodded; he rubbed his belly. Big Ed sat back in the car with his hat over his eyes, smiling at Dean. I sat on the fender. Marylou was in the women\u0027s John. From bushy shores where infinitesimal men fished with sticks, and from delta sleeps that stretched up along the reddening land, the big humpbacked river with its mainstream leaping came coil- ing around Algiers like a snake, with a nameless rumble. Drowsy, pe- ninsular Algiers with all her bees and shanties was like to be washed away someday. The sun slanted, bugs flip-flopped, the awful waters groaned. \n We went to Old Bull Lee\u0027s house outside town near the river levee. It was on a road that ran across a swampy field. The house was a dilapidated old heap with sagging porches running around and weep- ing willows in the yard; the grass was a yard high, old fences leaned, old barns collapsed. There was no one in sight. We pulled right into the yard and saw washtubs on the back porch. I got out and went to the screen door. Jane Lee was standing in it with her eyes cupped toward the sun. \"Jane,\" I said. \"It\u0027s me. It\u0027s us.\" \n She knew that. \"Yes, I know. Bull isn\u0027t here now. Isn\u0027t that a fire or something over there?\" We both looked toward the sun. \n \"You mean the sun?\" \n \"Of course I don\u0027t mean the sun--I heard sirens that way. Don\u0027t you know a peculiar glow?\" It was toward New Orleans; the clouds were strange. \n \"I don\u0027t see anything,\" I said. \n Jane snuffed down her nose. \"Same old Paradise.\" \n That was the way we greeted each other after four years; Jane used to live with my wife and me in New York. \"And is Galatea Dun- kel here?\" I asked. Jane was still looking for her fire; in those days she ate three tubes of benzedrine paper a day. Her face, once plump and Germanic and pretty, had become stony and red and gaunt. She had caught polio in New Orleans and limped a little. Sheepishly Dean and the gang came out of the car and more or less made themselves at home. Galatea Dunkel came out of her stately retirement in the back of the house to meet her tormentor. Galatea was a serious girl. She was pale and looked like tears all over. Big Ed passed his hand through his hair and said hello. She looked at him steadily. \n \"Where have you been? Why did you do this to me?\" And she gave Dean a dirty look; she knew the score. Dean paid absolutely no attention; what he wanted now was food; he asked Jane if there was anything. The confusion began right there. \n Poor Bull came home in his Texas Chevy and found his house invaded by maniacs; but he greeted me with a nice warmth I hadn\u0027t seen in him for a long time. He had bought this house in New Orleans with some money he had made growing black-eyed peas in Texas with an old college schoolmate whose father, a mad-paretic, had died and left a fortune. Bull himself only got fifty dollars a week from his own family, which wasn\u0027t too bad except that he spent almost that much per week on his drug habit--and his wife was also expensive, gobbling up about ten dollars\u0027 worth of benny tubes a week. Their food bill was the lowest in the country; they hardly ever ate; nor did the children--they didn\u0027t seem to care. They had two wonderful children: Dodie, eight years old; and little Ray, one year. Ray ran around stark naked in the yard, a little blond child of the rainbow. Bull called him \"the Little Beast,\" after W. C. Fields. Bull came driving into the yard and unrolled himself from the car bone by bone, and came over wearily, wearing glasses, felt hat, shabby suit, long, lean, strange, and laconic, saying, \"Why, Sal, you finally got here; let\u0027s go in the house and have a drink.\" \n It would take all night to tell about Old Bull Lee; let\u0027s just say now, he was a teacher, and it may be said that he had every right to teach because he spent all his time learning; and the things he learned were what he considered to be and called \"the facts of life,\" which he learned not only out of necessity but because he wanted to. He dragged his long, thin body around the entire United States and most of Europe and North Africa in his time, only to see what was going on; he married a White Russian countess in Yugoslavia to get her away from the Nazis in the thirties; there are pictures of him with the inter- national cocaine set of the thirties--gangs with wild hair, leaning on one another; there are other pictures of him in a Panama hat, surveying the streets of Algiers; he never saw the White Russian countess again. He was an exterminator in Chicago, a bartender in New York, a sum- mons-server in Newark. In Paris he sat at cafe tables, watching the sul- len French faces go by. In Athens he looked up from his ouzo at what he called the ugliest people in the world. In Istanbul he threaded his \"way through crowds of opium addicts and rug-sellers, looking for the facts. In English hotels he read Spengler and the Marquis de Sade. In Chicago he planned to hold up a Turkish bath, hesitated just for two minutes too long for a drink, and wound up with two dollars and had to make a run for it. He did all these things merely for the experience. Now the final study was the drug habit. He was now in New Orleans, slipping along the streets with shady characters and haunting connec- tion bars. \n There is a strange story about his college days that illustrates something else about him: he had friends for cocktails in his well- appointed rooms one afternoon when suddenly his pet ferret rushed out and bit an elegant teacup queer on the ankle and everybody high- tailed it out the door, screaming. Old Bull leaped up and grabbed his shotgun and said, \"He smells that old rat again,\" and shot a hole in the wall big enough for fifty rats. On the wall hung a picture of an ugly old Cape Cod house. His friends said, \"Why do you have that ugly thing hanging there?\" and Bull said, \"I like it because it\u0027s ugly.\" All his life was in that line. Once I knocked on his door in the 60th Street slums of New York and he opened it wearing a derby hat, a vest with nothing underneath, and long striped sharpster pants; in his hands he had a cookpot, birdseed in the pot, and was trying to mash the seed to roll in cigarettes. He also experimented in boiling codeine cough syrup down to a black mash--that didn\u0027t work too well. He spent long hours with Shakespeare--the \"Immortal Bard,\" he called him--on his lap. In New Orleans he had begun to spend long hours with the Mayan Codices on his lap, and, although he went on talking, the book lay open all the time. I said once, \"What\u0027s going to happen to us when we die?\" and he said, \"When you die you\u0027re just dead, that\u0027s all.\" He had a set of chains in his room that he said he used with his psychoanalyst; they were ex- perimenting with narcoanalysis and found that Old Bull had seven separate personalities, each growing worse and worse on the way down, till finally he was a raving idiot and had to be restrained with chains. The top personality was an English lord, the bottom the idiot. Halfway he was an old Negro who stood in line, waiting with every- one else, and said, \"Some\u0027s bastards, some\u0027s ain\u0027t, that\u0027s the score.\" \n Bull had a sentimental streak about the old days m America,especially 1910, when you could get morphine in a drugstore without prescription and Chinese smoked opium in their evening windows and the country was wild and brawling and free, with abundance and any kind of freedom for everyone. His chief hate was Washington bureau- cracy; second to that, liberals; then cops. He spent all his time talking and teaching others. Jane sat at his feet; so did I; so did Dean; and so had Carlo Marx. We\u0027d all learned from him. He was a gray, nonde- script-looking fellow you wouldn\u0027t notice on the street, unless you looked closer and saw his mad, bony skull with its strange youthful- ness--a Kansas minister with exotic, phenomenal fires and mysteries. He had studied medicine in Vienna; had studied anthropology, read everything; and now he was settling to his life\u0027s work, which was the study of things them-selves.-in the streets of life and the night. He sat in his chair; Jane brought drinks, martinis. The shades by his chair were always drawn, day and night; it was his corner of the house. On his lap were the Mayan Codices and an air gun which he occasionally raised to pop benzedrine tubes across the room. I kept rushing around, putting up new ones. We all took shots and meanwhile we talked. Bull was curious to know the reason for this trip. He peered at us and snuffed down his nose, ithfumpi, like a sound in a dry tank. \n \"Now, Dean, I want you to sit quiet a minute and tell me what you\u0027re doing crossing the country like this.\" \n Dean could only blush and say, \"Ah well, you know how it is.\" \"Sal, what are you going to the Coast for?\" \"Only for a few days. \n I\u0027m coming back to school.\" \"What\u0027s the score with this Ed Dunkel? What kind of character is he?\" At that moment Ed was making up to Galatea in the bedroom; it didn\u0027t take him long. We didn\u0027t know what to tell Bull about Ed Dunkel. Seeing that we didn\u0027t know anything about ourselves, he whipped out three sticks of tea and said to go ahead, supper\u0027d be ready soon. \n \"Ain\u0027t nothing better in the world to give you an appetite. I once ate a horrible lunchcart hamburg on tea and it seemed like the most delicious thing in the world. I just got back from Houston last week, went to see Dale about our black-eyed peas. I was sleeping in a motel one morning when all of a sudden I was blasted out of bed. This damn fool had just shot his wife in the room next to mine. Everybody stood around confused, and the guy just got in his car and drove off, left the shotgun on the floor for the sheriff. They finally caught him in Houma, drunk as a lord. Man ain\u0027t safe going around this country any more without a gun.\" He pulled back his coat and showed us his revolver. Then he opened the drawer and showed us the rest of his arsenal. In New York he once had a sub-machine-gun under his bed. \"I got some- thing better than that now--a German Scheintoth gas gun; look at this beauty, only got one shell. I could knock out a hundred men with this gun and have plenty of time to make a getaway. Only thing wrong, I only got one shell.\" \n \"I hope I\u0027m not around when you try it,\" said Jane from the kitchen. \"How do iyoui know it\u0027s a gas shell?\" Bull snuffed; he never paid any attention to her sallies but he heard them. His relation with his wife was one of the strangest: they talked till late at night; Bull liked to hold the floor, he went right on in his dreary monotonous voice, she tried to break in, she never could; at dawn he got tired and then Jane talked and he listened, snuffing and going thfump down his nose. She loved that man madly, but in a delirious way of some kind; there was never any mooching and mincing around, just talk and a very deep companionship that none of us would ever be able to fathom. Some- thing curiously unsympathetic and cold between them was really a form of humor by which they communicated their own set of subtle vibrations. Love is all; Jane was never more than ten feet away from Bull and never missed a word he said, and he spoke in a very low voice, too. \n Dean and I were yelling about a big night in New Orleans and wanted Bull to show us around. He threw a damper on this. \"New Or- leans is a very dull town. It\u0027s against the law to go to the colored sec- tion. The bars are insufferably dreary.\" \n I said, \"There must be some ideal bars in town.\" \n \"The ideal bar doesn\u0027t exist in America. An ideal bar is some- thing that\u0027s gone beyond our ken. In nineteen ten a bar was a place where men went to meet during or after work, and all there was was a long counter, brass rails, spittoons, player piano for music, a few mir- rors, and barrels of whisky at ten cents a shot together with barrels of beer at five cents a mug. Now all you get is chromium, drunken wom- en, fags, hostile bartenders, anxious owners who hover around the door, worried about their leather seats and the law; just a lot of scream- ing at the wrong time and deadly silence when a stranger walks in.\" \n We argued about bars. \"All right,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll take you to New Orleans tonight and show you what I mean.\" And he deliberately took us to the dullest bars. We left Jane with the children; supper was over; she was reading the want ads of the New Orleans iTimes-Picayune.i I asked her if she was looking for a job; she only said it was the most interesting part of the paper. Bull rode into town with us and went right on talking. \"Take it easy, Dean, we\u0027ll get there, I hope; hup, there\u0027s the ferry, you don\u0027t have to drive us clear into the river.\" He held on. Dean had gotten worse, he confided in me. \"He seems to me to be headed for his ideal fate, which is compulsive psychosis dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence.\" He looked at Dean out of the corner of his eye. \"If you go to California with this madman you\u0027ll never make it. Why don\u0027t you stay in New Orleans with me? We\u0027ll play the horses over to Graetna and relax in my yard. I\u0027ve got a nice set of knives and I\u0027m building a target. Some pretty juicy dolls downtown, too, if that\u0027s in your line these days.\" He snuffed. We were on the ferry and Dean had leaped out to lean over the rail. I fol- lowed, but Bull sat on in the car, snuffing, thfump. There was a mystic wraith of fog over the brown waters that night, together with dark driftwoods; and across the way New Orleans glowed orange-bright, with a few dark ships at her hem, ghostly fogbound Cereno ships with Spanish balconies and ornamental poops, till you got up close and saw they were just old freighters from Sweden and Panama. The ferry fires glowed in the night; the same Negroes plied the shovel and sang. Old Big Slim Hazard had once worked on the Algiers ferry as a deckhand; this made me think of Mississippi Gene too; and as the river poured down from mid-America by starlight I knew, I knew like mad that eve- rything I had ever known and would ever know was One. Strange to say, too, that night we crossed the ferry with Bull Lee a girl committed suicide off the deck; either just before or just after us; we saw it in the paper the next day. \n We hit all the dull bars in the French Quarter with Old Bull and went back home at midnight. That night Marylou took everything in the books; she took tea, goofballs, benny, liquor, and even asked Old Bull for a shot of M, which of course he didn\u0027t give her; he did give her a martini. She was so saturated with elements of all kinds that she came to a standstill and stood goofy on the porch with me. It was a wonderful porch Bull had. It ran clear around the house; by moonlight with the willows it looked like an old Southern mansion that had seen better days. In the house Jane sat reading the want ads in the living room; Bull was in the bathroom taking his fix, clutching his old black necktie in his teeth for a tourniquet and jabbing with the needle into his woesome arm with the thousand holes; Ed Dunkel was sprawled out with Galatea in the massive master bed that Old Bull and Jane nev- er used; Dean was rolling tea; and Marylou and I imitated Southern aristocracy. \n \"Why, Miss Lou, you look lovely and most fetching tonight.\" \n \"Why, thank you, Crawford, I sure do appreciate the nice things you do say.\" \n Doors kept opening around the crooked porch, and members of our sad drama in the American night kept popping out to find out where everybody was. Finally I took a walk alone to the levee. I wanted to sit on the muddy bank and dig the Mississippi River; in- stead of that I had to look at it with my nose against a wire fence. When you start separating the people from their rivers what have you got? \"Bureaucracy!\" says Old Bull; he sits with Kafka on his lap, the lamp burns above him, he snuffs, ithfumpi. His old house creaks. And the Montana log rolls by in the big black river of the night. \" Tain\u0027t nothin but bureaucracy. And unions! Especially unions!\" But dark laughter would come again. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/175.html","bookId":295,"book":{"id":295,"title":"On The Roadå¨è·¯ä¸","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ ãå¨è·¯ä¸ãä¸»äººå¬è¨å°ä¸ºäºè¿½æ±ä¸ªæ§ï¼ä¸è¿ªå®ãçä¸½å¢ç­å ä¸ªå¹´è½»ç·å¥³æ²¿éæ­è½¦æå¼è½¦ï¼å æ¬¡æ¨ªè¶ç¾å½å¤§éï¼æç»å°äºå¢¨è¥¿å¥ï¼ä¸è·¯ä¸ä»ä»¬çåæ»¥é¥®ï¼é«è°ä¸æ¹ç¦å®ï¼èµ°ç´¯äºå°±æ¡éæ¦è½¦ï¼å¤å®¿æè½ï¼ä»çº½çº¦æ¸¸è¡å°æ§éå±±ï¼æåä½é¸å½æ£ãåæ¶ï¼ä¹¦ä¸­ä½ç°äºä½èä¸»å¼ çå³å´å¼èªåæ§åä½...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12854026083d944.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
