{"id":38811,"no":21,"title":"Part Two Chapter 7","content":"It was there in the morning when I got up bright and early and found Old Bull and Dean in the back yard. Dean was wearing his gas-station coveralls and helping Bull. Bull had found a great big piece of thick rotten wood and was desperately yanking with a hammerhook at little nails imbedded in it. We stared at the nails; there were millions of them; they were like worms. \n \"When I get all these nails out of this I\u0027m going to build me a shelf that\u0027ll last ia thousand yearsi!\" said Bull, every bone shudder- ing with boyish excitement. \"Why, Sal, do you realize the shelves they build these days crack under the weight of knickknacks after six months or generally collapse? Same with houses, same with clothes. These bastards have invented plastics by which they could make hous- es that last iforever.i And tires. Americans are killing themselves by the millions every year with defective rubber tires that get hot on the road and blow up. They could make tires that never blow up. Same with tooth powder. There\u0027s a certain gum they\u0027ve invented and they won\u0027t show it to anybody that if you chew it as a kid you\u0027ll never get a cavity for the rest of your born days. Same with clothes. They can make clothes that last forever. They prefer making cheap goods so\u0027s every- body\u0027ll have to go on working and punching timeclocks and organiz- ing themselves in sullen unions and floundering around while the big grab goes on in Washington and Moscow.\" He raised his big piece of rotten wood. \"Don\u0027t you think this\u0027ll make a splendid shelf?\" \n It was early in the morning; his energy was at its peak. The poor fellow took so much junk into his system he could only weather the greater proportion of his day in that chair with the lamp burning at noon, but in the morning he was magnificent. We began throwing knives at the target. He said he\u0027d seen an Arab in Tunis who could stick a man\u0027s eye from forty feet. This got him going on his aunt, who went to the Casbah in the thirties. \"She was with a party of tourists led by a guide. She had a diamond ring on her little finger. She leaned on a wall to rest a minute and an Ay-rab rushed up and appropriated her ring finger before she could let out a cry, my dear. She suddenly rea- lized she had no little finger. Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!\" When he laughed he com- pressed his lips together and made it come out from his belly, from far away, and doubled up to lean on his knees. He laughed a long time. \"Hey Jane!\" he yelled gleefully. \"I was just telling Dean and Sal about my aunt in the Casbah!\" \n \"I heard you,\" she said across the lovely warm Gulf morning from the kitchen door. Great beautiful clouds floated overhead, valley clouds that made you feel the vastness of old tumbledown holy Ameri- ca from mouth to mouth and tip to tip. All pep and juices was Bull. \"Say, did I ever tell you about Dale\u0027s father? He was the funniest old man you ever saw in your life. He had paresis, which eats away the forepart of your brain and you get so\u0027s you\u0027re not responsible for any- thing that comes into your mind. He had a house in Texas and had carpenters working twenty-four hours a day putting on new wings. He\u0027d leap up in the middle of the night and say, \u0027I don\u0027t want that god- dam wing; put it over there.\u0027 The carpenters had to take everything down and start all over again. Come dawn you\u0027d see them hammering away at the new wing. Then the old man\u0027d get bored with that and say,\u0027Goddammit, I wanta go to Maine!\u0027 And he\u0027d get into his car and drive off a hundred miles an hour--great showers of chicken feathers fol- lowed his track for hundreds of miles. He\u0027d stop his car in the middle of a Texas town just to get out and buy some whisky. Traffic would honk all around him and he\u0027d come rushing out of the store, yelling,\u0027Thet your goddam noith, you bunth of bathats!\u0027 He lisped; when you have paresis you lips, I mean you lisps. One night he came to my house in Cincinnati and tooted the horn and said, \u0027Come on out and let\u0027s go to Texas to see Dale.\u0027 He was going back from Maine. He claimed he bought a house--oh, we wrote a story about him at college, where you see this horrible shipwreck and people in the water clutching at the sides of the lifeboat, and the old man is there with a machete, hackin at their fingers. \u0027Get away, ya bunth a bathats, thith my cottham boath!\u0027 Oh, he was horrible. I could tell you stories about him all day. Say, ain\u0027t this a nice day?\" \n And it sure was. The softest breezes blew in from the levee; it was worth the whole trip. We went into the house after Bull to meas- ure the wall for a shelf. He showed us the dining-room table he built. It was made of wood six inches thick. \"This is a table that\u0027ll last a thou- sand years!\" said Bull, leaning his long thin face at us maniacally. He banged on it. \n In the evenings he sat at this table, picking at his food and throwing the bones to the cats. He had seven cats. \"I love cats. I espe- cially like the ones that squeal when I hold \u0027em over the bathtub.\" He insisted on demonstrating; someone was in the bathroom. \"Well,\" he said, \"we can\u0027t do that now. Say, I been having a fight with the neigh- bors next door.\" He told us about the neighbors; they were a vast crew with sassy children who threw stones over the rickety fence at Dodie and Ray and sometimes at Old Bull. He told them to cut it out; the old man rushed out and yelled something in Portuguese. Bull went in the house and came back with his shotgun, upon which he leaned demure- ly; the incredible simper on his face beneath the long hatbrim, his whole body writhing coyly and snakily as he waited, a grotesque, lank, lonely clown beneath the clouds. The sight of him the Portuguese must have thought something out of an old evil dream. \n We scoured the yard for things to do. There was a tremendous fence Bull had been working on to separate him from the obnoxious neighbors; it would never be finished, the task was too much. He rocked it back and forth to show how solid it was. Suddenly he grew tired and quiet and went in the house and disappeared in the bath- room for his pre-lunch fix. He came out glassy-eyed and calm, and sat down under his burning lamp. The sunlight poked feebly behind the drawn shade. \"Say, why don\u0027t you fellows try my orgone accumulator? Put some juice in your bones. I always rush up and take off ninety miles an hour for the nearest whorehouse, hor-hor-hor!\" This was his \"laugh\" laugh--when he wasn\u0027t really laughing. The orgone accumula- tor is an ordinary box big enough for a man to sit inside on a chair: a layer of wood, a layer of metal, and another layer of wood gather in orgones from the atmosphere and hold them captive long enough for the human body to absorb more than a usual share. According to Reich, orgones are vibratory atmospheric atoms of the life-principle. People get cancer because they run out of orgones. Old Bull thought his orgone accumulator would be improved if the wood he used was as organic as possible, so he tied bushy bayou leaves and twigs to his mystical outhouse. It stood there in the hot, flat yard, an exfoliate ma- chine clustered and bedecked with maniacal contrivances. Old Bull slipped off his clothes and went in to sit and moon over his navel. \"Say, Sal, after lunch let\u0027s you and me go play the horses over to the bookie joint in Graetna.\" He was magnificent. He took a nap after lunch in his chair, the air gun on his lap and little Ray curled around his neck, sleeping. It was a pretty sight, father and son, a father who would cer- tainly never bore his son when it came to finding things to do and talk about. He woke up with a start and stared at me. It took him a minute to recognize who I was. \"What are you going to the Coast for, Sal?\" he asked, and went back to sleep in a moment. \n In the afternoon we went to Graetna, just Bull and me. We drove in his old Chevy. Dean\u0027s Hudson was low and sleek; Bull\u0027s Chevy was high and rattly. It was just like 1910. The bookie joint was located near the waterfront in a big chromium-leather bar that opened up in the back to a tremendous hall where entries and numbers were posted on the wall. Louisiana characters lounged around withiRacing Formsi. Bull and I had a beer, and casually Bull went over to the slot| machine and threw a half-dollar piece in. The counters I clicked \"Jackpot\"--\"Jackpot\"--\"Jackpot\"--and the last! \n \"Jackpot\" hung for just a moment and slipped back to \"Cherry.\" He had lost a hundred dollars or more just by a hair. \"Damn!\" yelled Bull. \"They got these things adjusted. You could see it right then. I had the jackpot and the mechanism clicked it back. Well, what you gonna do.\" We examined the iRacing Formi. I hadn\u0027t played the horses in years and was bemused with all the new names. There was one horse called Big Pop that sent me into a temporary trance thinking of my father, who used to play the horses with me. I was just about to men- tion it to Old Bull when he said, \"Well I think I\u0027ll try this Ebony Corsair here.\" \n Then I finally said it. \"Big Pop reminds me of my father.\" \n He mused for just a second, his clear blue eyes fixed on mine hypnotically so that I couldn\u0027t tell what he was thinking or where he was. Then he went over and bet on Ebony Corsair. Big Pop won and paid fifty to one. \n \"Damn!\" said Bull. \"I should have known better, I\u0027ve had experience with this before. Oh, when will we ever learn?\" \"What do you mean?\" \n \"Big Pop is what I mean. You had a vision, boy, a ivisioni. Only damn fools pay no attention to visions. How do you know your father, who was an old horseplayer, just didn\u0027t momentarily communi- cate to you that Big Pop was going to win the race? The name brought the feeling up in you, he took advantage of the name to communicate. That\u0027s what I was thinking about when you mentioned it. My cousin in Missouri once bet on a horse that had a name that reminded him of his mother, and it won and paid a big price. The same thing happened this afternoon.\" He shook his head. \"Ah, let\u0027s go. This is the last time I\u0027ll ever play the horses with you around; all these visions drive me to dis- traction.\" In the car as we drove back to his old house he said, \"Man- kind will someday realize that we are actually in contact with the dead \n and with the other world, whatever it is; right now we could predict, if we only exerted enough mental will, what is going to happen within the next hundred years and be able to take steps to avoid all kinds of catastrophes. When a man dies he undergoes a mutation in his brain that we know nothing about now but which will be very clear someday if scientists get on the ball. The bastards right now are only interested in seeing if they can blow up the world.\" \n We told Jane about it. She sniffed. \"It sounds silly to me.\" She plied the broom around the kitchen. Bull went in the bathroom for his afternoon fix. \n Out on the road Dean and Ed Dunkel were playing basketball with Dodie\u0027s ball and a bucket nailed on a lamppost. I joined in. Then we turned 10 feats of athletic prowess. Dean completely amazed me. He had Ed and me hold a bar of iron up to our waists, and just stand- ing there he popped right over it, holding his heels. \"Go ahead, raise it.\" We kept raising it till it was chest-high. Still he jumped over it with ease. Then he tried the running broad jump and did at least twenty feet and more. Then I raced him down the road. I can do the hundred in 10:5. He passed me like the wind. As we ran I had a mad vision of Dean running through all of life just like that--his bony face outthrust to life, his arms pumping, his brow sweating, his legs twinkling like Groucho Marx, yelling, \"Yes! Yes, man, you sure can go!\" But nobody could go as fast as he could, and that\u0027s the truth. Then Bull came out with a couple of knives and started showing us how to disarm a would-be shiver in a dark alley. I for my part showed him a very good trick, which is falling on the ground in front of your adversary and gripping him with your ankles and flipping him over on his hands and grabbing his wrists in full nelson. He said it was pretty good. He dem- onstrated some jujitsu. Little Dodie called her mother to the porch and said, \"Look at the silly men.\" She was such a cute sassy little thing that Dean couldn\u0027t take his eyes off her. \n \"Wow. Wait till ishei grows up! Can you see iheri cuttin down Canal Street with her cute eyes. Ah! Oh!\" He hissed through his teeth. \n We spent a mad day in downtown New Orleans walking around with the Dunkels. Dean was out of his mind that day. When he saw the T \u0026 NO freight trains in the yard he wanted to show me every- thing at once. \"You\u0027ll be brakeman \u0027fore I\u0027m through with ya!\" He and I and Ed Dunkel ran across the tracks and hopped a freight at three in- dividual points; Marylou and Galatea were waiting in the car. We rode the train a half-mile into the piers, waving at switchmen and flagmen. They showed me the proper way to get off a moving car; the back foot first and let the train go away from you and come around and place the other foot down. They showed me the refrigerator cars, the ice com- partments, good for a ride on any winter night in a string of empties. \"Remember what I told you about New Mexico to LA?\" cried Dean. \"This was the way I hung on ... \" \n We got back to the girls an hour late and of course they were mad. Ed and Galatea had decided to get a room in New Orleans and stay there and work. This was okay with Bull, who was getting sick and tired of the whole mob. The invitation, originally, was for me to come alone. In the front room, where Dean and Marylou slept, there were jam and coffee stains and empty benny tubes all over the floor; what\u0027s more it was Bull\u0027s workroom and he couldn\u0027t get on with his shelves. Poor Jane was driven to distraction by the continual jumping and running around on the part of Dean. We were waiting for my next GI check to come through; my aunt was forwarding it. Then we were off, the three of us--Dean, Marylou, me. When the check came I rea- lized I hated to leave Bull\u0027s wonderful house so suddenly, but Dean was all energies and ready to do. \n In a sad red dusk we were finally seated in the car and Jane,Dodie, little boy Ray, Bull, Ed, and Galatea stood around in the high grass, smiling. It was good-by. At the last moment Dean and Bull had a misunderstanding over money; Dean had wanted to borrow; Bull said it was out of the question. The feeling reached back to Texas days. Con- man Dean was antagonizing people away from him by degrees. He giggled maniacally and didn\u0027t care; he rubbed his fly, stuck his finger in Marylou\u0027s dress, slurped up her knee, frothed at the mouth, and said, \"Darling, you know and I know that everything is straight be- tween us at last beyond the furthest abstract definition in metaphysical terms or any terms you want to specify or sweetly impose or harken back ... \" and so on, and zoom went the car and we were off again for California. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/176.html","bookId":295,"book":{"id":295,"title":"On The Road在路上","description":"简介： 《在路上》主人公萨尔为了追求个性，与迪安、玛丽卢等几个年轻男女沿途搭车或开车，几次横越美国大陆，最终到了墨西哥，一路上他们狂喝滥饮，高谈东方禅宗，走累了就挡道拦车，夜宿村落，从纽约游荡到旧金山，最后作鸟兽散。同时，书中体现了作者主张的即兴式自发性写作...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12854026083d944.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
