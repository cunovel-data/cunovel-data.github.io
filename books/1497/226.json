The thick white flame on his body also gradually disappeared. Once the flame completely vanished, the delicate and handsome face of a young man was revealed. The young man’s black eyes blinked gently as he tilted his head back. The vicissitude in his eyes swiftly withdrew and a cunningness and vitality of a young man replaced it. “Teacher, just now… what happened?” Xiao Yan gently twisted his neck, pressed his eyebrows together and softly asked. His inquiry was naturally about why Yao Lao’s sure attack from before was suddenly shattered. “It’s the doing of that thing in your sleeves…” Yao Lao helplessly answered, “Was it not for the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ isolating its Qi, I’m afraid that Yun Zhi and the Snake-People would have sensed that this Qi was Queen Medusa’s…” “It’s her?” Hearing this, Xiao Yan stilled for a moment. His palm extended into his sleeves and carefully pulled out the Seven-Colored small snake, whose entire body was warm like jade. He placed her on his palm and stared intently. Sensing Xiao Yan’s focus, the Seven-Colored small snake also raised her small head up high. She blinked her pale purple-colored eyes which were filled with spirituality. Opening her snake mouth, she gently extended her snake tongue seemingly intending to lick Xiao Yan’s face. Tilting his head slightly to avoid this small creature’s naughty act, Xiao Yan smiled and immediately asked in a soft but somewhat serious voice, “Teacher… do you think that she has already regained Queen Medusa’s memories?” “I don’t think so… If she had regained her memories, Queen Medusa would not stay by your side given her haughty and rude character… I think, perhaps it was because I intended to kill the five Dou Wangs of the Snake-People just now that caused Queen Medusa to temporary break through the bound of the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python. Looking at the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’s current manner, I think that Queen Medusa’s spirit was once again suppressed.” Yao Lao voiced his thoughts. Xiao Yan let out a gentle sigh. His palm gently rubbed the Heaven Swallowing Python’s head and he bitterly smiled as he muttered, “This little thing is really a time bomb. It is difficult to say when Queen Medusa will once again emerge from it…” “Back then, I have already told you this, but you still insist on keeping her by your side.” Yao Lao gloatingly laughed. Xiao Yan rubbed his head and stared at the cute Heaven Swallowing Python before helplessly saying, “Blame it on the extremely large attraction this little creature has… I hope that it will be able to continue suppressing Queen Medusa’s spirit.” Taking out a bottle of Amethyst Winged Lion Birth Essence from the storage ring, Xiao Yan dropped a few drops of it into the Heaven Swallowing Python. The little creature then extended its snake tongue in satisfaction before it lazily entered into Xiao Yan’s sleeves. After appeasing the Heaven Swallowing Python, Xiao Yan’s gaze swept across the desert under him and gradually descended from some distance on a particular spot. He lowered his head and stared at the yellow sand under his feet as he said softly, “This should be the place.” Xiao Yan’s palm slowly opened, aimed at the sand dune and was slightly quiet. An enormous suction force suddenly surged from his palm. Under the suction force, the yellow sand in the area under him suddenly swarmed up toward the sky. As the yellow sand was removed, a pitch black hole that was a few meters deep suddenly appeared under him. A green-colored lotus seat which was emitting a faint glow was suspended within the hole. Seeing that the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ was completely safe, Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief. His hand beckoned and the green lotus immediately changed into a green light that shot toward Xiao Yan’s palm. Xiao Yan carried the Green Lotus Seat in his hand and observed the continuously soaring tiny green-colored flame with a gaze that was somewhat intoxicated with a heated glow. “Let’s go to the outer part of the desert. That place should be a little safer. After which, find a quiet place and swallow the ‘Heavenly Flame’!” Appearing to understand the desire for the ‘Heavenly Flame’ in Xiao Yan’s heart, Yao Lao immediately suggested. “Ok!” Xiao Yan nodded his head seriously. He took an ‘Energy Recovery Pill’ out from the storage ring and threw it into his mouth. With a chewing motion, he swallowed it into his body. He then carried the Green Lotus Seat and began to fly crazily toward the outer regions of the desert. As Xiao Yan’s body disappeared within the yellow sand filled sky, the soul-stirring fight for the ‘Heavenly Flame’ within the Tager Desert finally came to a close with someone obtaining a complete victory. After flying for nearly half a day and consuming thirteen ‘Energy Recovery Pills’ along the way, Xiao Yan finally and gradually arrived at the outer regions of the Tager Desert. The direction that Xiao Yan was currently headed for was toward a region on the map which was the most sparsely populated since he needed a place that was extremely isolated. When the hot sun in the sky gradually set and completely fell below the horizon, there was finally some withered grass that appeared in the monotonous yellow sand. He flew for some time more and a fresh green color once again appeared in his sight. In the distant horizon, the small peak of a majestic mountain began to gradually appear. Upon seeing the appearance of the peak of the mountain, Xiao Yan, who had trekked a long distance for an entire day, finally let out a long breath as he swung his numbed arms. The Purple Cloud Wings that were appearing and disappearing because of the exhaustion of Dou Qi once again became much more active. Xiao Yan flapped his wings, turned into a black light and shot directly to the majestic mountain in the distance. Ten minutes later, Xiao Yan descended at the foot of the mountain, blowing out clouds of dust. Currently, the black robe all over his body was covered with a layer of tiny yellow sand. He wiped off the perspiration that was mixed with sand from his head. After his sleeves randomly wiped his face, he ended up completely messing it up and ended up appearing extremely sloppy. After he landed, Xiao Yan’s expression was somewhat pale and serious. He swiftly placed the Green Lotus Seat by his side and hurriedly took out an ‘Energy Recovery Pill’ from the storage ring and stuffed it into his mouth. He didn’t even have time to talk to Yao Lao before he swiftly displayed the training form and began to enter the training mode to recover his Dou Qi. Xiao Yan was supported by the ‘Energy Recovery Pill’ as he hurried on with his journey but a medicinal pill was after all an external object. Repeatedly relying on them to recover Dou Qi would easily cause his body to form a reliance to it. If he continued to repeatedly use it for a long time, his body’s ability to recover Dou Qi by itself may gradually decline to the extent that in the end, any sort of Dou Qi recovery without the pills would become effectively nothing.… It was difficult to imagine but if a Dou Practitioner were to lose the ability to recover Dou Qi, could he still be called a Dou Practitioner? Thus, after having hurried on with the journey for such a long time, the most important thing for Xiao Yan after landing was to hurriedly activate the Qi Paths in his body and begin to recover Dou Qi. The training time continued for around an hour before Xiao Yan gradually opened his eyes. He let out a deep slightly yellow feculent breath. After twisting his somewhat numb muscles, he bitterly smiled and said, “Although the ‘Flame Mantra’ has currently evolved to the Middle Huang level after swallowing the ‘Purple Flame’, it is still a Huang class Qi Method. It is insufficient to support my consumption. If I did not have such a large number of ‘Energy Recovery Pills’ to support me, I would have been unable to persist for so long. Ugh…” “Hehe, be rest assured. This time, once you successfully swallow the ‘Heavenly Flame’, the ‘Flame Mantra’ will definitely be able to evolve into the Xuan Class. When that time comes, the you with a Xuan Class Qi Method should be able to surpass most of the strong people with the same level of Qi Method...” Yao Lao comforted with a grin. “Hopefully. I will do my best.” Tilting his head, Xiao Yan eyed the beautiful Green Lotus Seat on the ground and tightly pursed his lips. A stubborness faintly seeped out from those firmly pressed lips. Xiao Yan did not have the slightest doubt of the energy contained within the ‘Heavenly Flame’. Although the evolution of the Qi Method across classes required a terrifying amount of energy that was more than ten times between levels such as Dou Zhe and Dou Shi, Xiao Yan believed that the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ definitely possessed this frightening energy! Otherwise, it did not possess the qualification to cause countless number of strong people in the continent to bow down to it. After taking in a deep breath of fresh mountain air, Xiao Yan lifted the Green Lotus Seat and placed it in front of him. His eyes stared intently at the cluster of green-colored flame seedling at the center of the lotus that was flooded with spirituality. A faint gratification and bitterness flashed over his face. Two years ago, when he had just received that mysterious black scroll, he understood somewhere deep in his heart that… seeking the ‘Heavenly Flames’ would be his lifelong mission. Only through repeatedly swallowing the ‘Heavenly Flame’ would he be able to gradually step toward the peak. If he wanted to stand at the top of the golden pagoda of the continent and overlook everything, he needed to put in that nearly crazy amount of effort! In two years, Xiao Yan seemed to have walked over half the Jia Ma Empire in order to obtain the ‘Heavenly Flame’. Back then, in the underground magma world, it was difficult to imagine just how excited Xiao Yan was in his heart when he got to know that there was a ‘Heavenly Flame’ present. However, when he obtained only an empty green lotus after fighting to almost death with that Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent a couple of times, he was despondent, but he still did not choose to give up. Thus, the persistent him made the following actions that would cause anyone who heard about them to feel that Xiao yan was insane. With just the strength of a Dou Shi, he entered the desolate desert alone and charged into the territory of the Snake-People race; which the humans viewed as a forbidden place. He did all this by himself. During his journey into the desert, he had been dancing on the scythe of the death god yet managed to narrowly avoid its blade that would have taken away his soul... Due to his courage and effort, the lucky young man became the greatest victor of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ game where even a Dou Ling could only stand aside and watch. Xiao Yan had worked hard for three years in order to obtain this small green-colored flame seedling. Today, he had finally got what he wanted as he hugged it in his chest. This was the reward of victory that belonged to him. Slowly lifting his head, Xiao Yan stared at the crescent moon in the sky and gradually widened his mouth. An instant later, the young and somewhat hoarse soft roar which carried an unrestrained happiness reverberated throughout the sky above the mountain. The dark black ring trembled slightly and Yao Lao’s body suddenly appeared behind Xiao Yan. He lowered his head to watch the tightened body of the young man which had been constrained until it trembled slightly. A relief and gentleness flashed across those turbid old eyes of his. During the two years, he had accompanied Xiao Yan, observing his growth, observing his effort and observing how he time and time again broke past his limit in battles and training. His two years of effort had finally bore fruit!
