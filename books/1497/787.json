He flicked his finger a moment later and the paper note turned into flames before swiftly disappearing.\n “The ‘Hall of Souls’ huh…”\n Xiao Yan softly muttered in his mouth. A dense, cold killing intent slowly surged within his dark-black eyes. His hatred for this organisation could be said to have seeped deep into his bones. It was because the two people closest to him had already landed in their hands.\n A cold glint appeared in Xiao Yan’s eyes. He suddenly turned his body a moment later and swiftly walked down from the tall building. Currently, he was totally unaware of this mysterious ‘Hall of Souls’. He must have some understanding of them if he wanted to rescue Yao Lao and his father. However, the people from the ‘Hall of Souls’ were usually mysterious and it was difficult for an ordinary person to find them. Hence, this might be a chance for him.\n As long as he could capture a person from the ‘Hall of Souls’, Xiao Yan would be able to obtain some news about the ‘Hall of Souls’. This was of crucial importance to him.\n Xiao Yan swiftly found Xiao Ding and the rest as this thought flashed across his heart. He described the situation to them in detail. They were startled when they heard that Xiao Yan was about to leave the Jia Ma Empire and only nodded after being silent for a long while. Xiao Ding clearly understood that if he got Xiao Yan to remain in the Jia Ma Empire, it would end up restraining him. The vast Dou Qi continent might well be the place where Xiao Yan could display his true abilities.\n Xiao Yan did not delay any longer after having accounted for the matters in the Yan Alliance. He found Zi Yan within the capital before rising into the air with her as he swiftly flew to the place where the Magical Beast Mountain Range was located. Xiao Yan was fearful of the people from the ‘Hall of Souls’. Hence, he naturally needed to gather all of his helpers on his trip to the Chu Yun Empire this time around. Medusa was obviously the best choice.\n Currently, the Snake-People Tribe had already settled an area close to the Magical Beast Mountain Range. Although they would engage in fights with some Magical Beast during this period of time, this was not considered a bad thing for some of the Snake-People who were thirsty for battle.\n After having stayed within the Jia Ma Empire, the Snake-People Tribe’s guard against humans had weakened a little. There was also a passageway on the boundary between the tribe and the outside world. Although there were Snake-People Tribe’s soldiers tightly guarding around the passageway, it was undoubtedly much better when compared to the past when they immediately killed upon seeing a human. It was likely that with interaction over a long period of time, the Snake-People Tribe would gradually abandon these guarded thoughts and become members of the Jia Ma Empire.\n Although the area where the Snake-People Tribe was located was far from the capital, Xiao Yan and Zi Yan managed to appear at the edge of the Magical Beast Mountain Range after an hour with their speed. Their gazes slowly swept over this vast mountain range. They were able to see those Snake-People passing through the forest.\n Some people within the vast forest also noticed them after they had paused in the sky above this place. A couple of figures swiftly rushed to the sky with cautious eyes. They were stunned when they saw Xiao Yan, and the caution in their eyes greatly weakened.\n “Friends from the Snake-People Tribe. I would like to meet Queen Medusa over some matters. Can you please lead the way?” Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward the few experts from the Snake-People Tribe, and spoke in a deep voice.\n “The tribe leader is in a retreat. If you wish to see her, please follow us to meet with the First Commander first. Only he and the few Elders from the tribe can enter the chamber.” A Snake-Person expert hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth to speak.\n “First Commander.”\n Xiao Yan knit his brows upon hearing this. This expert, who was only weaker than Medusa in the entire Snake-People Tribe, was also someone whom he had heard of. However, Xiao Yan had never met him. From the occasional mention by some Snake-People, this person seemed to be a person who was crazy over training. During this big battle between the Jia Ma Empire and the three great empires, this person persisted on taking a retreat for over a year. The desert had completely emptied by the time he exited his retreat. If the Snake-People Tribe did not have a special communication method, it was likely that this fellow would not even be able to locate his tribesmen.\n Of course, this was naturally insufficient to cause Xiao Yan to frown in this manner. This training maniac also viewed Medusa as a female deity in his heart, much like most male Snake-People. Due to his strength being inferior to Medusa within the tribe, he would normally be the person who would have the greatest chance to be with her. However, Xiao Yan had suddenly erupted like a tiger that blocked his path. Hence, despite not having met this person, Xiao Yan also knew that it was likely that this person possessed quite the enmity for him.\n Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head as these thoughts flashed through his heart. He said, “In that case, can you please lead the way.” Although Xiao Yan felt that this First Commander, whom he had not met, would be troublesome, Xiao Yan did not fear him. If the other person did not understand the situation, he did not mind showing his hand. In any case, as long as one defeated these top experts from the Snake-People Tribe, one would be able to save a lot of trouble in the future.\n The couple of Snake-People experts nodded quite courteously upon seeing this. Their body moved and they shot toward the forest. Xiao Yan and Zi Yan followed close behind.\n “Xiao Yan, relax. I will help you beat that whatever First Commander up if he dares to speak some nonsense!” Zi Yan moved close to Xiao Yan and laughed. She seemed to also be aware of the well-known First Commander from the Snake-People Tribe.\n “You should be more obedient. Otherwise, I will not bring you along anymore.” Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head as he responded.\n “Chi, if you don’t bring me away, I will run away by myself just like Liu Qing, Lin Yan, and the others.” Zi Yan curled her lips and was not the least bit afraid of Xiao Yan’s threat.\n Xiao Yan could only roll his eyes when he heard this. He cursed Lin Yan and the two other bastards in his heart. They actually dared to flee by themselves. He would definitely teach them a proper lesson the next time that they meet.\n During the one year that Xiao Yan was undertaking a retreat, Lin Yan and the two others had felt bored from staying in the Jia Ma Empire. Therefore, they left the Jia Ma Empire together and headed on a journey after leaving behind a message. However, they might not have been aware that a big battle erupted within the Jia Ma Empire not long after they had left.\n The sight of the forest in front of Xiao Yan suddenly broadened while he was cursing those three people in his heart. A tribe that occupied an extremely large space appeared in his sight.\n The tribe’s buildings were built beside the mountain, and its shape appeared as though it was embedded within the mountain’s body. Hustling and bustling Snake-People were moving to and fro in this area. Some of the Snake-People soldiers stood on certain tall spots fully armed. Their sharp eyes were observing the surrounding situation at all times.\n Xiao Yan and Zi Yan followed the experts from the Snake-People Tribe and passed through the tribe. Some time later, they gradually came to a stop at a wide open ground deep within the tribe. There was a flight of rock stairs that extended deep into the mountains behind the open ground. However, this flight of stone stairs was currently guarded by many experts from the Snake-People Tribe.\n Xiao Yan’s eyes were thrown toward the rock stairs that extended to the edge of his sight as he stood in the open ground. Finally, they paused among the many Snake-People guards at that spot. At that location was a bald male Snake-Person with his eyes shut. Threads of violent aura lingered over his body. That shiny bald head was covered with a grayish-white snake tattoo. It appeared just like a grayish-white poison snake lying there, causing one to shudder without feeling cold.\n Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed as his gaze paused on that bald-headed Snake-Person. He could sense that this person’s strength was currently around the peak of the Dou Huang class. Other than Masuda and the four Elders, it was likely that he was the strongest within the entire Snake-People Tribe. Since that was the case, it seemed that this bald-headed Snake-Person ought to be that First Commander of the Snake-People Tribe…\n The bald-headed Snake-Person seemed to have sensed something when Xiao Yan threw his gaze over. Those shut eyes were suddenly opened and triangular-shaped pupils stared intently at Xiao Yan like an enormous python that was about to swallow a person.\n “Xiao Yan from the Yan Alliance requests to meet Queen Medusa. Please notify her!” Xiao Yan’s expression did not change in the face of the Snake-Person’s gaze which would cause one’s hairs to stand on end. He cupped his hand and slowly spoke.\n “Xiao Yan?”\n The ruthless aura of the bald-headed Snake-Person immediately soared upon hearing this name that had recently become a blotch in his heart. Suddenly, he stood up.\n “You are that Xiao Yan?” The bald-headed Snake-Person’s tail was swung and his body strangely appeared at a spot not far from Xiao Yan. His eyes stared at Xiao Yan while he spoke in a somewhat dark, cold manner.\n Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly when he sensed the enmity within the other party’s words. He immediately nodded.\n A battle smile surfaced on the face of the bald-headed Snake-Person when he saw Xiao Yan nod his head. He did not say any other nonsense as he tightly clenched his fist. Green light lingered and appeared. Dense snake scales surfaced. His fist carried a dark, cold force as it violently smashed toward Xiao Yan with a furious roar.\n Xiao Yan’s expression turned much darker as he sensed the cold, sharp wind that was on the other party’s fist. His legs stomped gently as a powerful dark-green flame suddenly surged from his body.\n The flame rose and the ground swiftly became dry. Numerous cracks swiftly spread from the dryness. The faces of the surrounding experts from the Snake-People Tribe were shock as they hurriedly moved back. Being naturally born with a cold constitution, they were most afraid of these kind of things.\n Surprise flashed across the eyes of the bald-headed Snake-Person when he saw the jade-green flame on Xiao Yan’s body. However, his fist did not pause even a little. The force on it instead became more vicious.\n A small lovely body suddenly appeared when this fist made contact with a layer of the jade-green flame. A lovely cry sounded and a tiny fist collided with the Snake-Person in front of the stunned eyes from the surrounding Snake-People.\n “Bang!”\n A low, muffled explosion sounded upon contact. Immediately, a frightening ripple spread out. Zi Yan and that bald-headed Snake Person both took a couple of heavy steps back.\n After forcefully stabilizing his body, the bald-headed Snake-Person’s eye were solemn as he looked at Zi Yan who was rubbing her small fist. After which, he gave a cold smile to Xiao Yan. A palm-sized jade-green lotus flame slowly drifted up from the hands of the indifferent-looking Xiao Yan just before the bald-headed Snake-Person was about to ridicule. A faint, cold voice resounded across the open ground.\n “If you take another step forward, you better be prepared to lie in a bed for a couple of months.”\n The bald-headed Snake-Person swallowed a mouthful of saliva as his eyes shrank. He looked at the jade-green fire lotus. He could sense that an extremely wild, violent, frightening energy was contained within it.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-787","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
