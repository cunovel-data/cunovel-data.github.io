At that moment, amusement and shock flashed across her exquisite and pretty face. She then covered her mouth immediately and laughed in a tender voice, “Xiao Yan di-di, after not seeing you for three years, not only have you become mature, you have also become much more shy.”\n “I have always been very shy.” Xiao Yan nodded his head and said seriously.\n “You weren’t like this three years ago. Has Xiao Yan di-di forgotten? Back then when I recognized your identity you were extremely boorish.” A smile flashed across Ya Fei’s beautiful peach blossom eyes as she said.\n Eyeing Ya Fei who was emitting an enchanting temptation between her smile and frown, Xiao Yan felt somewhat helpless. After three years of training, this matured woman appeared to have become increasingly enchanting. Perhaps it was because of her different status now, but when she spoke to him, she did not have the cautiousness back then. Instead, having met as old friends, their relationship became somewhat more affectionate.\n “Your intention for coming to the Jia Ma Sacred City… should be due to that agreement, right?” The smile on Ya Fei’s smile was slowly withdrawn as she stared at Xiao Yan in front of her and inquired softly.\n Xiao Yan smiled and nodded slightly. He said, “Who asked the blood to rush to my brain back then, resulting in me making that agreement. These three years, I have endured quite a lot of hardships because of that agreement.”\n Ya Fei eyed Xiao Yan’s face, which had less sentimentality and innocence. Instead, it held more maturity and seriousness compared to three years ago. She sighed. Although Xiao Yan did not tell her about his experiences during these three years in detail, she clearly knew in her heart that he must have endured hardships that others would have difficulty even imagining.\n “Xiao Yan di-di, after three years of training, I think that you should have a clear picture of the strength that the Misty Cloud Sect has in the Jia Ma Empire.” Ya Fei frowned and said softly.\n “I am clear. It is a really big being which would only require one finger to destroy our Xiao clan.” Xiao Yan calmly said with a smile.\n “Ah.” Eyeing that calm face which had no ripple, Ya Fei helplessly shook her head and said, “It has been three years, yet you still have such a stubborn character. However, you can rest assured that with the Misty Cloud Sect’s position and status, they would not hurt the Xiao clan even if they had a deep and terrible annoyance with you. The arrogant old fellows of the Misty Cloud Sect won’t throw their face away.”\n “If they dare to touch the Xiao clan… I will dare to go missing for ten years and then come out to kill everyone in the Misty Cloud Sect.” Xiao Yan smiled slightly. His smile was noticeably thick and cold.\n Being pierced by the dark and cold killing intent that had suddenly swarmed into Xiao Yan’s eyes, Ya Fei felt her body become somewhat numb. Her hands involuntarily crossed in front of her chest. This sudden action of hers, however, caused the surrounding ‘animals’ to have an impulse of hugging her into their chest and caress her with care.\n “I’m sorry, I forgot that you don’t really like to train.” Recovering himself, Xiao Yan eyed the fragile looking manner of Ya Fei. He was briefly at a loss before he spoke apologetically.\n “Who said that I don’t like to train? I am also a Dou Zhe, alright? It is just that your killing aura has become heavier after three years of training. It can even be compared to someone in our clan who had climbed out from a pile of corpses on the battlefield.” Hearing Xiao Yan’s words, Ya Fei immediately threw a look of disdain at Xiao Yan and said with dissatisfaction.\n “Huh? These clothes of yours… you have actually become a tier two alchemist?” Ya Fei’s shifting gaze suddenly paused at the chest of Xiao Yan’s long alchemist robe. When she saw the occupational tier badge, she could not help but let out an involuntary cry of shock.\n “Ke ke, I was merely lucky.” Xiao Yan carelessly laughed.\n “Lucky? Ah, for an ordinary person, advancing from a beginner into a tier two alchemist is impossible without at least five to six years of time. Yet, you have reached this step in three years. I’m afraid that is not mere luck.” Eyeing the young man who revealed something shocking at every instance, Ya Fei sighed helplessly.\n Xiao Yan shook his head and smiled. He did not continue to pursue this question. Instead, his gaze swept across the hall, realizing that he and Ya Fei had already become the center of attention. Immediately, he whispered, “Are you currently in charge of this auction house?”\n “These words of yours really gives me a blow…” Hearing this, Ya Fei sighed, feeling a little depressed. She smiled bitterly and replied, “The authority for this auction house headquarters is completely in the hands of those old fellows in the clan. This is their lifeblood. How is it possible that they would let me manage it? Currently, I am only the Supervising Acting Elder here.”\n As she glanced at Xiao Yan, Ya Fei quickly smiled and said, “Although I am not in charge of this place, but at the very least, I also have a portion of the rights that come with my position. I don’t think that your purpose for coming here was to look for me, right? What do you need?”\n “Can we find a quiet place to talk?” Xiao Yan scanned the large crowd around him who had their ears lifted vertically and helplessly said.\n “Of course, follow me.” Ya Fei smiled and nodded her head. She had just turned around when her gaze suddenly drifted to Hai Bo Dong, who was behind Xiao yan and leaning against a crystal counter while watching the items in boredom. After hesitating for a moment, she asked, “Is this Old Sir together with you?”\n “Huh? Do you want to converse alone and leave my old self aside? Is it going to be something shady?” Although Ya Fei’s voice was soft, Hai Bo Dong still managed to catch her words. He turned around and laughed.\n Being teased by Hai Bo Dong in such a manner, a faint redness swarmed onto Ya Fei’s exquisite face. However, it was fortunate that she was extremely good at handling issues with human relations. She gave an immediate sweet smile and said, “What is old sir saying, there’s no reason for our auction house to leave people aside when doing business.”\n “Little girl’s mouth is really eloquent. However, I am not those fools who only think about women every day. I’m poor and cannot afford to take out the money to buy the things here.” Hai Bo Dong laughed.\n Hearing this, shock flashed across Ya Fei’s eyes. However, the expression on her face continued to maintain a smile. Although her strength was lousy, it did not mean that her eyes were poor. She really could not see through Hai Bo Dong’s strength but she was able to vaguely tell that the old man in front of her was not an ordinary old person. That was sufficient.\n “We have spent a long time hurrying on our journey here. He’s just bored, you can simply ignore him.” Xiao Yan smiled at Ya Fei.\n Ya Fei smiled. She turned around and slowly walked toward a staircase in one corner of the hall. Her heels stepped on the shiny and clean bluestone ground surface, emitting a ‘click-clack’ sound. Her elegant pace caused people to be unable not fall into a deep longing for her.\n After his gaze swept over her alluring back, Xiao Yan swiftly followed her under the observation of numerous heated gazes in the hall.\n “Don’t tell me that the old man is your mysterious teacher from back then?” Facing the front, Ya Fei softly asked without anyone noticing as she wore a smile on her face and nodded toward those who had greeted her.\n “No.” Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head.\n “Oh.” Hearing this, Ya Fei slightly nodded her head. She instantly stopped talking and led the two of them slowly toward a staircase with a few guards present.\n Eyeing Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong following behind, the few guards eyed each other. According to the rules, people who were not members of the clan were usually not allowed to enter. However, Ya Fei was currently holding the post of Supervising Acting Elder. Her authority was quite great. At that moment, none of them dared to stop them. Only when the three of them were about to enter did a guard have no choice but to bite the bullet and take a step forward. However, before he spoke, Ya Fei gave him a faint glance, which caused him to swallow the words in his throat. He smiled bitterly and stepped back.\n “They are my friends. If something happens, I will take responsibility.” Ya Fei said those words in an indifferent voice before leading Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong up the stairs. However, something at the top of the stairs suddenly caused her eyebrows to inadvertently knit slightly together.\n Following the rumbling of footsteps, a few human figures slowly appeared at the bending corner of the stairs. The man who was leading them was around the same age as Ya Fei. His somewhat pale-white face was clearly a result of overindulgence in carnal pleasures. Although the build of this person did not appear strong, he was actually a strong person who had just entered the Dou Shi class not long ago based on the Qi that his body faintly emitted.\n The pale-faced young man’s gaze carried some converting and desire as it drifted over the stairs to see Ya Fei below. Observing the lower ground from a higher position, the latter’s curves were coincidentally perfectly highlighted. Instantly, that young man’s breathing became slightly erratic.\n Sensing the change in the young man above, Ya Fei’s pretty face became slightly ugly. She lifted her head and coldly glanced at the young man. The spring water like pupils that had originally maintained a smile had a disgust that was difficult to hide at the moment.\n “Hee hee, Ya Fei, this place is where our clan conducts official business. Other people are not allowed to enter. Don’t tell me that you, as the Acting Supervising Elder, you don’t even know this?” Watching the disgust of Ya Fei in his eyes, the young man’s face immediately became much gloomier. His training talent could be considered quite good within the Primer clan. However, this qualification which could cause other ladies to adore him greatly, merely provoked a greater disgust from Ya Fei. This caused the haughty him to really feel unbearable.\n “I have already said, if something goes wrong, I will take responsibility. Please move aside!” Ya Fei’s cold voice did not give the other party any face. She pulled Xiao Yan’s hand and started climbing the stairs.\n Being ignored in such a manner in front of his subordinates, the corner of the mouth of the pale-faced young man twitched. This was especially so when Ya Fei grabbed Xiao Yan’s hand. An unknown jealous flame instantly rose in his eyes. Although Ya Fei was usually full of smiles, appearing very approachable, he knew that this woman’s heart had a certain discrimination against men. It was extremely rare for one to see her taking the initiative to pull a man\u0027s hand.\n “Hei, I wondered why she usually treats me so coldly. It seems that you actually like this kind of unripe young man. What good taste. But I wonder if he can satisfy you?” Glancing at Xiao Yan’s calm face, the young man could not help but ridicule him.\n Ya Fei was expressionless as she climbed the stairs as though she had not heard the obscene words of the young man. However, Xiao Yan, whose hand was being tightly held by her, could sense that her nails had already viciously clawed into his palm.\n Xiao Yan, who had unluckily suffered from the trouble other people’s affairs, helplessly shook his head. He glanced at the pale-faced young man with eyes that were so indifferent, they did not have the slightest emotion.\n “Brat, do you want to die?” Seeing Xiao Yan\u0027s eyes which put him in an extremely bad mood, the young man immediately became furious. His voice was dark and cold as he spoke.\n Hearing this, Xiao Yan’s footsteps paused. His arm, however, was pulled. Ya Fei in front of him shook her head slightly, indicating for him to ignore the matter.\n Seeing this, Xiao Yan sighed and shook his head. He then nodded and followed.\n “Qi, soft… Ya Fei, your standards are really terrible. If you really need a young man, I think you need not find someone like that, no?” Ya Fei’s patience ended up causing the young man to become even more vicious. He opened his mouth and viciously laughed.\n Xiao Yan once again paused his walking footsteps. His hand trembled slightly as he shook his hand that was being pulled by Ya Fei free. After which, he eyed the moving outline of Ya Fei’s back, shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, “You can even endure this?”\n Ya Fei’s body stiffened. She did not speak. Her fragile back appeared somewhat weary.\n “I’m sorry, I cannot…” Xiao Yan waved his hand, suddenly turning around and staring darkly at the laughing young man.\n “Be careful, he’s a one star Dou Shi…”\n Seeming to have sensed Xiao Yan’s action, Ya Fei hurriedly turned around. However, before her shout fell, an explosion suddenly rang at the stairs, causing her pretty face to be completely stunned.\n “You damn bastard. Do you eat dog’s sh*t in order to grow?” Following the energy explosion, Xiao Yan’s similarly dark, cold and vicious curses rang in the stairway.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-275","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
