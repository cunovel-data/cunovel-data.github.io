Although the strength of a ‘Heavenly Flame’ was extremely great, it should not have much of an appeal to the Snake-People race. After all, this kind of wild and extremely destructive ‘Heavenly Flame’ was like water to fire for their icy blood. Thus, when they heard Queen Medusa using a somewhat regretful tone to reject the offer, Gu He, as well as Yan Shi, Feng Li and the others beside him had completely stunned faces. “Has this woman’s mind spoiled… what’s the point in keeping a ‘Heavenly Flame’ that does not have much benefit to her? Was it not better to exchange it for something that would be useful to her and create a win-win scenario?” Yao Shi helplessly shook his head and softly mumbled in puzzlement. Beside him, Feng Lin also shook his head. His face was filled with incomprehension. Compared to their shock, Yue Mei and Mo Basi on the city wall were much calmer. From the rejection of Queen Medusa, they had clearly understood what exactly she was planning to do… “Ugh, as expected. Her Majesty really looks like she wants to do that. Otherwise. it would have been unlikely for her to reject this kind of trade.” Yue Mei sighed gently and whispered. Mo Basi nodded his head gently. There was a worry and bitterness on his feminine eagle like face. “Tsk tsk, Queen Medusa lives up to her name. She could reject such good terms with such decisiveness.” With his body hidden under the huge rock, Xiao Yan raised his head, eyed the bewitching beauty and involuntarily sucked his lips. “It is indeed a little strange… According to logic, the ‘Heavenly Flame’ does not have much attraction to the Snake-People… Why did she reject that offer? Don’t tell me she is afraid that after Gu He obtains the ‘Heavenly Flame’, his increased strength would endanger the Snake-People race? No, this reasoning does not seem to make much sense. A strong person such as Gu He would seldom join the fight between both sides. Otherwise, they would have started fighting the moment Queen Medusa appeared.” Yao Lao’s voice was filled with doubt. He mused for a long while before he appeared to suddenly recall something. He let out a soft involuntarily cry, “Don’t tell me?” “What? Teacher?” Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows together and inquired softly in his heart. “I will tell you in detail later…” Yao Lao quickly replied. After which, he became silent and did not respond regardless of how Xiao Yan shouted in his heart. After shouting one more time, Xiao Yan was speechless as he shook his head. He mumbled softly, “Acting so mysteriously…” Queen Medusa’s rejection caused Gu He to still for a moment. Fortunately, his tolerance was not something that an ordinary person could compare with. In a moment, he quickly withdrew the stunned expression on his face. He frowned and looked at Queen Medusa in the distance. Sighing gently, he said, “Your Majesty, your rejection is really beyond my expectation. I don’t like to be secretive so the terms just now were the most precious things that I could offer. Originally I thought that they could move Your Majesty. Unfortunately… It seems that I have miscalculated.” “Grandmaster Gu He, your terms have got me very interested, but because of some reasons, the ‘Heavenly Flame’ is extremely important to me now.” The regret on Queen Medusa’s pretty face was quite difficult to hide. Evidently, she was not completely indifferent to the items that Gu He had mentioned. Gu He sighed. The expression on his face was somewhat listless. He clearly understood that if Queen Medusa was unwilling to hand over the ‘Heavenly Flame’, the strength of the few of them would not be able to force her hand. “Can you tell me why you want to keep the ‘Heavenly Flame’?” Gu He laughed bitterly. “I’m sorry. No.” Queen Medusa shook her head and waved her hand lazily. She said in a bland voice, “Forget it. Grandmaster Gu He, go back to where you came from. As for that mysterious compensation, forget it. It’s fine as long as you leave here quickly. The leaders of the Eight Large Tribes of the Snake-People race are already rushing here. Among them, there are some who have extreme hatred toward you humans. Thus, you should leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, there may be some unnecessary trouble when they appear.” Hearing Queen Medusa’s words, Gu He smiled bitterly and sighed. He tilted his head to face his few companions with a helpless face. “Old He, are we just going to leave like that?” Yan Shi glanced at Queen Medusa in the distance and said with a frown. “What can we do if we don’t leave? It’s not like you don’t know Queen Medusa’s strength. Do you think it is possible for us to forcefully take it?” Gu He sighed and said. To be honest, he naturally did not want to leave empty handed. However, the opponent’s strength was too great. Moreover, this was the territory of the enemy. If they were to use force, the ending might not be too pleasant. Hearing Gu He’s words, Yan Shi and Feng Li became slightly sluggish. With their strength, they naturally could not challenge Queen Medusa. Their gaze immediately shifted toward the black-robed person by the side and softly asked, “What is Sect Leader Yun’s opinion?” Seeing Yan Shi’s and Feng Li’s action, Gu He also turned his gaze toward the black-robed person, waiting for her to speak. The black-robed person was quiet. She did not immediately answer Yan Shi’s question. Since she did not speak, everyone could only quietly wait. Queen Medusa and the others opposite also shifted their gazes to the black-robed person. The black-robed person was the focus of everyone’s attention. A long while later, she moved slightly. Her human figure slowly took a step forward and the black robe was slightly raised, revealing a snow white meagre and graceful chin. Her faint cool voice was briskly emitted, “I have once haphazardly read some information about the Queen of the Snake-People from an ancient book. It said that once the Queen Medusa reaches the peak of a Dou Huang, she can undergo a strange evolution if she has sufficiently good luck. The Queen Medusa which has undergone the evolution would not only be able to transform into a human body but her strength would also be promoted into that of a Dou Zong. However, the chances of such evolution succeeding are extremely low. Moreover… the most essential thing needed for this evolution is a ‘Heavenly Flame’... I think that the reason why Queen Medusa was not willing to hand over the Heavenly Flame is because she is planning on undergoing this evolution that requires the help of a ‘Heavenly Flame.” The black-robed person tilted her head slightly and spoke blandly, “It really is so…” Yao Lao suddenly appeared upon hearing the voice that sounded in the sky. He said with a shocked sigh, “How unexpected. Queen Medusa is planning on doing this… uh? Hey, boy, are you listening?” “Uh…” Xiao Yan regained his mind after being pulled back by Yao Lao’s words. He said in an uncertain soft voice, “This voice… Why is it different from that night? Moreover, it has a little familiar yet foreign feeling… Teacher, do you have this feeling?” “Do I have nothing better to do than to care about women’s voices?” Yao Lao said helplessly. The attention he paid to medicinal pills far exceed that of women. Regardless of how beautiful the voice was, it was difficult for him to feel any infatuation. “*Cough*...” Xiao Yan let out an awkward cough and could only put aside the question of the origin of the voice from his mind. He softly said, “So Queen Medusa can really evolve into a Dou Zong with the help from the ‘Heavenly Flame’?” “Indeed she can. However, this evolution is extremely dangerous. If it were not to be done properly, she will be completely incinerated into nothingness by the ‘Heavenly Flame’. But if she were able to withstand it, she will undergo an extremely strange evolution. I am also not really certain about what kind of transformation would occur. This kind of thing is usually only known by the person involved.” Yao Lao said with a smile. Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. Why was the situation becoming more and more complex. He could only helplessly shake his head. Lifting his head to watch the calm sky, he said softly, “It is better if they quickly start fighting. That way, I will have the chance to go in and steal the ‘Heavenly Flame’...” “The Qi of Queen Medusa seems a little strange… Hm, it seems to have an illusionary feeling.” Sweeping his Spiritual Perception across the empty space, Yao Lao suddenly said strangely. “What do you mean?” He blinked his eyes, feeling baffled. A long while later, he said in a stunned voice, “You mean that this Queen Medusa is a fake?” “We are very far away and I only roughly sensed a little because I was afraid of being discovered. There seems to be something wrong.” Yao Lao helplessly said. “Things really are getting more and more complex.” Xiao Yan mumbled once more and gradually became quiet. He once again threw his gaze toward the sky. Hearing the words the black-robed person said, there was an obvious change to Queen Medusa’s expression. Her captivating eyes stared intently at the black-robed person with a cold aura hovering over her. She said in a soft voice, “I did not expect that you knew about such things. It really surprises me.” “Not only do I know that you need a ‘Heavenly Flame’ to complete your evolution, but I also know that… The current you is merely an energy body that possesses the thoughts of Queen Medusa. I think that the real Queen Medusa should be at some place preparing to evolve.” The black-robed person said in a faint voice. As the black-robed person said those words, everyone from both sides were shocked. Yue Mei and Mo Basi’s faces changed drastically. They glanced at each other and saw a worried feeling in the each other’s eyes. “Sect Leader Yun, you mean that the current Queen Medusa is merely an energy body?” Yan Shi pointed at Queen Medusa far away and said with a stunned voice. From his senses, he did not find anything inappropriate. “Yes.” The black-robed person nodded her head. She lifted her feet and quietly stepped downwards. Her body instantly… disappeared. At the moment when the black-robed person disappeared, the pretty face of Queen Medusa far away changed. She was about to move when a dark black figure appeared in an instant behind her. A jade white hand was extended out and landed on Queen Medusa back in a seemingly slow yet fast manner. “Such insolence!” Seeing that black-robed person who attacked in a flash, Yue Mei and Mo Basi’s face suddenly changed. The pairs of energy wings on their back flapped and swiftly pounced toward the black-robed person. “Hehe, the both of you better not randomly interfere.” Two figures flashed across. In the middle of the journey, Yan Shi and Feng Li blocked the two of them. The originally peaceful atmosphere in the sky immediately transformed into an aggressive one. Ignoring the actions of those around, the black-robed person leaned her body forward and eyed Queen Medusa whose body was stiff. In a soft voice, she said, “Am I right, Your Majesty?” “You really live up to being a Dou Huang by being able to discover my energy avatar so quickly.” Queen Medusa’s narrow and long pupils shrunk as she softly laughed. Her manner of leisure did not show any panic at being caught. “I think the Your Majesty’s real body cannot be disturbed now, no? Otherwise you would not allow us to act so presumptuously. Ah… quite a good opportunity.” The black-robed person smiled. Her palm suddenly shook and a ferocious force was unleashed from her body, heavily striking Queen Medusa’s back. Following a muffled sound, the bewitching and moving Queen Medusa in midair immediately turned into pale purple smoke that slowly rose and disappeared. “They have finally begun fighting…” Watching that black-robed person in the sky who did not hesitate in attacking, Xiao Yan let out a soft cheer. His face was filled with a brilliant smile.
