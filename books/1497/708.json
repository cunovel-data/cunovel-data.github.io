One could still clearly hear it even over a hundred kilometers away…\\n\\n The loud thunder resounded across the sky, causing a countless number of people on the open ground to lift their heads in shock. They could only see that the deep-purple flame had become like a prairie. The enormous sky was occupied by the fire wave. At the middle of the purple fire wave was a cluster of dark-green flame that was unusually bright. It stood majestically still regardless of how the deep-purple flame attacked.\\n\\n The strange dark-green flame suddenly shook after a couple of breaths. Immediately, an intense firestorm erupted from it. Any area occupied by the dark-green flame would cause the purple flame to immediately become like boiling oil meeting ice as it swiftly scattered. That manner actually seemed as though it was no match for an exchange with the dark-green flame.\\n\\n The dark-green flame was merely a few feet wide initially. However, after the instantaneous expansion, the deep-purple flame that had spread all over the sky was expelled and swallowed by the other flame in the blink of an eye…\\n\\n “Grug! Grug! Grug! Grug!”\\n\\n The human figure that was hidden under the cluster of deep-purple flame was finally revealed after the flame had been expelled. The frightening strength that had instantaneously erupted poured over his body in a torrent-like manner. A mouthful of fresh bright-red blood was spat out in front of the eyes of a countless number of people. The body became just like a bird with broken wings as it descended weakly from the sky.\\n\\n The body swiftly fell in front of the many stunned gazes in the open ground. When it was still around a couple of dozens of meters from the ground, the somewhat gloomy-faced Yun Shan above the wedding stage finally waved his sleeve. A force received the body and it slowly landed on the ground.\\n\\n Gu He’s expression was pale-white when he landed on the ground. The corner of his mouth was filled with traces of blood. Some depressed feeling was in his eyes. He clearly understood that the frightening strength that Xiao Yan had unleashed earlier was something that was impossible for him to receive. Moreover, he clearly sensed that Xiao Yan had quietly withdrew some force just before the latter unleashed his strength. Otherwise, it was likely that even Gu He would have a difficult time preserving his life today. At the very least, he was seriously injured.\\n\\n The numerous gazes around looked at the pale-faced Gu He on the opposite side. The place was instantly completely silent. Everyone looked at each other. The shock that remained in their eyes caused them to still have some difficulty accepting reality.\\n\\n A member of the younger generation who was merely around twenty years old had actually defeated a genuine elite Dou Huang within a short ten exchanges. This kind of frightening strength really caused some people to feel the situation was little too dream-like...\\n\\n Numerous stunned gazes paused on Gu He for a moment. Then, they immediately and simultaneously moved toward the sky without any prior agreement. At this moment, the dark-green flame that had spread over the sky had disappeared. A black-robed, young man was suspended in it. The dark-green flame burned slowly. The demeanor of the expert was in its embryonic stage.\\n\\n Jia Xing Tian and the others watched Gu He who was defeated in the final attack from a certain spot in the sky. They also sighed in relief and exchanged looks with one another. All of them were quietly stunned. This fellow was indeed frightening. The terrifying attack that he had displayed earlier was likely something that only Hai Bodong and Jia Xing Tian could block.\\n\\n “We have one less headache now that Gu He has been defeated. Given his character, he would definitely not go back on his word after agreeing to Xiao Yan’s challenge in front of so many people.” Hai Bodong wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and laughed.\\n\\n “Aye, however, the intense big fight earlier has exhausted Xiao Yan greatly. Fortunately, this fellow has quite a number of medicinal pills. His Dou Qi recovery speed is far greater than what an ordinary person could compare with. Otherwise, the situation might be quite bad in the big fight with Yun Shan later.” Jia Xing Tian nodded his head and spoke. He had watched Xiao Yan stuff a couple of medicinal pills into his mouth after defeating Gu He earlier.\\n\\n “When the big fight begins later, all of you should go and block the Elders of the Misty Cloud Sect. Do not allow them to create a formation and attack together. Otherwise, it is likely that there will be quite a lot of trouble. As for Yun Shan, let’s do as Xiao Yan said before. Leave him to Xiao Yan to handle.” Hai Bodong’s gaze slowly swept toward the enormous Misty Cloud Sect and spoke in a deep voice while looking at those Misty Cloud Sect’s Elders who were suspended in the air.\\n\\n “Allow him to deal with Yun Shan alone… isn’t that a little risky?” The deputy head of the Alchemist Association, Qi Mi Er, hesitated for a moment before saying.\\n\\n “Relax, you should not forget that Xiao Yan still has the help of that mysterious teacher. Moreover, if he really cannot do it, Old Jia and I or the Serene Sea Scaly Beast can swiftly free ourselves and lend him a helping hand. Given the frightening strength of the few of us, it is likely that we could even contend against Yun Shan for awhile.” Ha Bodong’s gaze glanced at Yun Shan in the middle of the wedding stage in the open ground and slowly replied.\\n\\n “I will issue the signal when the fight begins. At that time, the hundred thousand soldiers at the foot of the mountain will immediately attack the mountain while being personally led by Yao Ye!” Jia Xing Tian nodded his head and spoke in a deep voice.\\n\\n Hai Bodong also nodded slightly upon hearing this. His gaze focused intently on Yun Shan as he coldly said, “Next, we will have to keep a close eye on this old bastard…”\\n\\n The eyes of the pale-faced Gu He on the open ground finally began to recover some color after he was momentarily absent-minded. He lifted his head to look at the tall black-robed, young man and laughed bitterly.\\n\\n “You have won!”\\n\\n Everyone in the open ground was stunned when they heard Gu He personally opening his mouth to admit defeat. They could imagine just how much a great blow of defeat affected Gu He.\\n\\n “I will not intervene in the matter between you and the Misty Cloud Sect today.” Gu He suddenly smiled. His gaze immediately swept toward Yun Yun, who was quietly standing under the wedding stage. His body trembled and the carefully made wedding robe was being torn inch by inch before finally turning into fragments that were scattered on the ground.\\n\\n “Yun Yun, perhaps your choice is correct. I am indeed inferior to him…”\\n\\n Yun Yun was silent as she looked at Gu He’s bitter smile. Gu He had an extreme pride deep within his bones. One could imagine just what kind of blow he had received after being defeated by Xiao Yan in order to cause him to say such words. However, she did not say any other words at this moment. It was only a long while later before she softly inquired, “Are you alright?”\\n\\n “I don’t have many serious injuries…” Gu He waved his hand. He immediately raised his head and looked at Yun Shan on the wedding stage. He cupped his hands together and said, “Sect Leader Yun Shan, Gu He has lost today and must do as I promised. I will no longer intervene in the matter between both parties. Sect Leader, please end this wedding. Goodbye!”\\n\\n Gu He ignored Yun Shan’s ugly expression after saying these words. He turned around and strode out of the Misty Cloud Sect in front of the many observing gazes around him.\\n\\n Many private conversations sounded on the open ground after Gu He’s figure slowly disappeared. Some of those experts who were invited by Gu He exchanged looks with each other. They let out bitter laughter. Since the main character had already left, there was no meaning to them staying behind. They possessed quite a deep relationship with Gu He and would naturally not reject him if he wanted them to lend him a hand. However, Gu He had lost without complaint and it was natural that they could not forcefully attack. Moreover, even if they wanted to step forward, it was likely that they would only end up seeking their own humiliation. Even someone of Gu He’s strength was unable to endure more than ten exchanges with Xiao Yan, much less them.\\n\\n Since Gu He had already left, they would naturally not continue to stay. Although they felt great anticipation for the frightening great battle that was about to erupt on this Misty Cloud Mountain, they were no fools. It was likely that they would end up in trouble if they were to be dragged into such a situation.\\n\\n Hence, after these people quietly exchanged glances, the better ones cupped their hands toward Yun Shan on the wedding stage while those eccentric ones did not even say a word before all of them turned around and headed out of the Misty Cloud Sect.\\n\\n The open ground immediately became a little emptier after these experts left. Those that had remained were mostly people who were invited by the Misty Cloud Sect as well as experts or factions that feared the might of Yun Shan. Although they knew that they would merely get innocently implicated into the matter if they continued to remain in this place, they could only toughen their skin and remain in the face of Yun Shan’s increasingly solemn expression.\\n\\n On the wedding stage, Yun Shan’s eyelids twitched while these experts left with Gu He. His expression was gloomy. He had planned to get Xiao Yan’s and Gu He’s people to engage in a big fight while he ended up benefiting from it. However, he did not expect that Xiao Yan would actually propose this ten exchange agreement and really end up defeating Gu He within ten exchanges. Moreover, what caused his anger to rise was that this single-minded Gu He acted in such a trustworthy fashion and obediently led his people away.\\n\\n “Foolish person. He only has some skill with alchemy… but his mind is so rigid.” Yun Shan darkly and furiously cursed in his heart as he slowly inhaled a breath of air. He suppressed the churning mood in his heart before standing up from the chair and slowly walked toward the edge of the wedding stage. His face was indifferent as he raised his head and looked at the black-robed, young man in the sky.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, I must admit that you have become a lot stronger during these three years…” Yun Shan gently waved his sleeves as his voice slowly sounded.\\n\\n Xiao Yan glanced at Yun Shan from the sky while he laughed coldly, “Are you finally unable to remain sitting?”\\n\\n “However, if this is what you are relying on, this ancestor (refer to this Dou Zong) shall tell you that you will definitely be unable to descend the Misty Cloud Mountain alive!” Yun Shan shook his head and smiled. His expression suddenly turned cold as a pair of hands suddenly tightened. A majestically frightening aura surged out from his body!\\n\\n As the frightening aura spread out, the numerous experts under the wedding stage immediately felt their breathing become dull. They were shocked to realize that the Dou Qi within their bodies was circulating somewhat sluggishly in the face of this kind of suppression!\\n\\n Even the mere aura of an elite Dou Zong was actually this frightening!\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression slowly became solemn as he sensed the majestic aura that surged out of Yun Shan’s body. This fellow was indeed much stronger than he was three years ago. It seemed that this time around, it was really going to be a life and death battle!\\n\\n “All members of the Misty Cloud Sect listen up, do not leave any invaders today!” Yun Shan lifted his eyes as his dense, cold voice slowly reverberated unceasingly through the entire sky.\\n\\n “I want everyone in the Jia Ma Empire to know that anyone who dares offend our Misty Cloud Sect will be killed without mercy!”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-708","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
