{"id":47507,"no":873,"title":"Chapter 873: Xin Lan","content":"Chapter 873: Xin Lan There was still quite some distance between the Jia Nan Academy and Peace Town. Hence, by the time Xiao Yan’s group had arrived, it was already noon time. Xiao Yan did not stay for too long in the Outer Academy. He only paused for a moment before hurrying without stopping to the Inner Academy of the Jia Nan Academy, which sat in the deep mountains behind. With the speed of Xiao Yan’s group, they passed through the vast deep mountains, that appeared quite dangerous in their eyes back then, within just half an hour. When that extremely familiar mountain stream appeared within Xiao Yan’s sight, he knew in his heart that he had arrived at the Inner Academy. Under Su Qian lead, the group entered the Inner Academy, which was covered by that distorted space, without any obstruction. After they passed through the silver main gate, a vast lush-green forest appeared in front of their eyes. Xiao Yan’s heart felt somewhat moved, and he felt nostalgic. Back then, he had entered the Inner Academy from this place. That so called ‘Fire Energy Hunting Competition’ had also allowed him, this newbie, to gain some reputation within the Inner Academy. “Ke ke, the record that you created back then is something that no new students can beat. The new students every year still suffer a so-called blow from the older students. Something like new students snatching Fire Energy has never happened again.” Su Qian by the side laughed. Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled slightly when he heard Su Qian mention some of his deeds. He softly exhaled a breath of air and smiled as he said, “Let’s go…” His body moved after those words sounded and he drifted gently toward the forest. Su Qian and the others followed close behind. After exiting the forest, the Inner Academy that, occupied an extremely large ground, once again appeared in Xiao Yan’s group’s sight. Xiao Yan stood on the top of a slope and looked down on the Inner Academy that was filled with life from a high vantage point. Currently, the size of the Inner Academy was a little bigger than it was two years ago. Due to the entry requirement of the Inner Academy being relaxed a little during these few years, the Inner Academy was currently filled with even more liveliness. Of course, the intense competitions had also increased. Those who could enter this Inner Academy were not ordinary people, and those who possessed the ability were naturally unwilling to have another step above their heads. A ‘Strong Ranking,’ which was not considered special, was the target that they were worked hard toward. In order to enable oneself to advance in ranking, quite a number of students went all out to train… The group paused outside of the Inner Academy. However, Xiao Yan did not immediately follow Su Qian and the rest in. He really wanted to take a look at ‘Pan’s Gate’ to see just how the first faction that he had ever established had transformed… Su Qian did not stop Xiao Yan when he saw the situation. He smiled and nodded before saying, “You can just find a random person and inquire about the location of the headquarters of ‘Pan’s Gate.’ After you have caught up with everyone, you can come to the Inner Academy Elders Compound to look for me.” Su Qian did not wait for Xiao Yan’s reply after he spoke. He turned around and led the Little Fairy Doctor, Xiao Li and everyone else to the deeper parts of the Inner Academy, leaving Xiao Yan alone where he stood. Xiao Yan sent the backs of Su Qian and the rest off with his eyes. After they had disappeared, he finally let out a slow breath. A somewhat energetic smile gradually surged onto his young face. This kind of smile had not appeared on Xiao Yan’s face for quite some time. All this time, he had been pressured to advance by various matters. Sometimes, he himself would forget that he was merely a young man in his early twenties and not a white-haired, old man. However, under the Inner Academy’s atmosphere that was filled with vitality, Xiao Yan’s mood had become much more relaxed. The current him looked like a young man who matched his age and not a young-old man. Xiao Yan’s hand rubbed his other hand as he slowly walked within the spacious Inner Academy. Along the way, he randomly grabbed a student and inquired about the location of ‘Pan’s Gate.’ Only after the other party informed him with a surprised face did he thank the former before turning around and leaving. “This little fellow… is he new? He is actually unaware of the location of ‘Pan’s Gate’’s headquarters?” That student finally softly muttered as he watched Xiao Yan’s back become distant. Xiao Yan followed the route that the student had indicated, and finally appeared outside of ‘Pan’s Gate’s’ headquarters after ten plus minutes. When he stopped and looked at the villa that occupied an extremely spacious ground, he involuntarily became somewhat stunned despite his calmness. Was this Inner Academy a little too generous? They actually gave a student faction such luxurious headquarters. Compared to the situation in the past where they could only use their hostel as a base, it was really the difference between clouds and mud. Of course, Xiao Yan, who had been away from the Inner Academy for over two years, naturally did not know the ridiculous amount of strength the current ‘Pan’s Gate’ possessed within the Inner Academy. Over half of the most valued top fifty of the ‘Strong Ranking’ wore a ‘Pan’s Gate’ badge on their chest. Even quite a few newly promoted Elders of the Inner Academy wore the title of ‘Pan’s Gate’ on them. Due to the current ‘Pan’s Gate’ becoming more strict, resulted in the increase in the solidarity of its members. Thus, this academy faction became more controlled and constrained. This was completely different from the original and somewhat loose academy faction. Xiao Yan clicked his tongue and let out a praise in his heart before he walked into this enormous manor. His eyes glanced at the four cold and stern looking men at the entrance. Looking at the aura of these four people, they would definitely not be considered weak even if placed within the entire Inner Academy. Getting a member with such skill to stand sentry was something that had never happened when Xiao Yan was still around back then. Xiao Yan’s body moved as he glanced at the cautious gaze of the four cold, stern-looking men who were patrolling to and fro. A faint silver light flickered and he charged into the interior of ‘Pan’s Gate’ in a ghost-like manner without anyone realizing. After which, he smiled and patted his hands together before walking toward the deeper part of ‘Pan’s Gate.’ Xiao Yan once again felt the spaciousness of this manor as he walked around. He randomly found a path and walked along it. A moment later, his sight became more spacious as a tidy ground appeared in front of him. Waves of suppressed cheers were also being transmitted from this location. When he heard the cheer, Xiao Yan raised his head and looked at the large crowd of black masses. He involuntarily smiled and steadily walked over. He had sensed a somewhat familiar aura from that spot. Upon coming closer to the crowd, Xiao Yan discovered that there was a tall platform in the middle of the congregation. A pale-blue-clothed lady was seated cross-legged on this platform. The lady’s appearance was extremely beautiful. Her lovely well-proportioned body, under her clothes, revealed an alluring curve that caused one to be attracted. However, a thread of cold indifference kept others far away and the diffusion of this lady’s demeanor caused some people to feel somewhat regretful. At a glance, one could tell that she was quite a cold woman. These kinds of women were the type that men had an extremely great difficulty subduing. Therefore, a person who did not have much ability could only adopt an attitude of watching her from afar without attempting to fondle her. Of course, the thing that interest Xiao Yan the most was not this woman’s appearance. Instead, he was interested in the medicinal cauldron that was placed in front of her. At this moment, the flame within the medicinal cauldron was churning rapidly and a faint medicinal fragrance was being emitted. Clearly, this woman was an alchemist! Xiao Yan’s gaze revealed some surprise as it swept over the interior of the medicinal cauldron. He gently sniffed with his nose and the surprise in his eyes grew even denser. He softly muttered, “It is actually a tier 4 medicinal pill, Sky Qi Pill. It is unexpected that this young woman already possesses the ability to refine this kind of medicinal pill at such a young age. Her pill refining talent is not inferior to Gu He’s disciple, Liu Ling.” At this moment, the blue-clothed woman’s attention was clearly placed on the medicinal cauldron. Some crystal clear perspiration would occasionally form on her smooth forehead. Eventually, a droplet would follow her somewhat skinny oval face and drip down. Although her face was perspiring, the blue-clothed lady clearly possessed some remaining strength. Her Spiritual Strength controlled the flame and carefully conceived the medicinal pill. Waves of rich medicinal fragrance were repeatedly being transmitted, causing the surrounding observers to repeatedly swallow their saliva. Some soft conversation were also being transmitted. “Senior Xin Lan’s medicinal refining skill has really become superb. Being able to refine a tier 4 medicinal pill at such an age, her achievements in the future will definitely be extraordinary.” “Hee hee, that’s right. Whoever marries her in the future will never need to worry about not having medicinal pills to eat…” “Chi, you are daydreaming again. Senior Xin Lan has set her sights very high. There is basically no man in this Inner Academy who can catch her sharp eyes. Moreover, she personally said that the only condition that needed to be met in order to go out with her was to surpass her in medicinal refining skills. In this Inner Academy, other than some of the Elders of instructors in the Alchemy Department, who else could surpass her?” “Hei, who says there isn’t anyone? Back then, our chief refined a tier 5 medicinal pill when he competed with medicinal refinement against someone else in the Inner Academy!” “*Cough*... move away from me. The chief has already left the Inner Academy for two years. How can that be counted…” Xiao Yan felt somewhat funny as he heard the surrounding conversations. It seemed that he had really become a legendary figure. While Xiao Yan was quietly feeling that things were comical, the blue-clothed lady on the platform had suddenly let out a lovely cry. She beckoned with her hand and a round medicinal pill with rich medicinal fragrance flew out of the medicinal cauldron. It finally landed on her smooth jade-like hand Those under the platform immediately let out waves of cheers after seeing the lady’s successful refinement. Numerous bootlicking voices were delivered to the blue-clothed lady without their owners’ faces turning red. However, this did not appear to have any effect on her. Her pretty face remained cold and impassive. Her long pretty eyes swept once around and those who were shouting and cheering immediately shut their mouths in embarrassment. “It’s a pity…” Xiao Yan’s gaze swept over the medicinal pill in the lady’s hand, shook his head slightly, and spoke aloud. Xiao Yan suddenly felt his surroundings becoming a little quiet the moment his voice sounded. He involuntarily raised his head in surprise, only to see a pair of cold and bright eyes looking indifferently at him. The blue-clothed lady looked down at the somewhat-familiar-looking black-robed, young man. Her cold voice was slowly transmitted. “Tell me what is there to pity?” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-873","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
