{"id":47915,"no":1281,"title":"Chapter 1281: Miserable End","content":"Chapter 1281: Miserable End Xiao Yan was startled initially when he heard that sharp scream from old ghost Zhai Xing. Immediately, his heart abruptly turned cold. The Hall of Soul actually still had some experts hidden in this place? Moreover, the status of this person was actually such that even old ghost Zhai Xing, who was a Hall of Soul Tianzun, had to address as sir… “Looks like the Hall of Soul has indeed come prepared... This thought flashed passed Xiao Yan’s heart. A fierce glint appeared in Xiao Yan’s flickering eyes. Regardless of what the case was, he should kill this old ghost Zhai Xing, who had repeatedly oppose him, before deciding on anything! “Chi!” A desire to kill surged within his heart. The speed at which the black light sphere spread suddenly quickened. The frightening suction force that was within close proximity shocked old ghost Zhai Xing until his soul scattered. That horrified sharp cry became increasingly moanful. “Trash, you have been turned into such a state by a younger generation. What face do you have to be a Tianzun of the Hall of Soul?” Just before the light sphere was about to reach old ghost Zhai Xing’s body, an indifferent and completely emotionless voice suddenly resounded slowly in the sky. Soon after, a crack line was swiftly formed in the space behind old ghost Zhai Xing. A blue figure slowly walked out. With the appearance of this figure, the air in this entire place immediately became moist. Some faint tiny raindrop spluttered and poured downwards from the sky. This mysterious change naturally attracted Xiao Yan’s attention. Immediately, his heart sank. This person was actually able to rely on his vast and mighty Dou Qi to stir the change of the natural energy around him. Such a strength was really shocking. Base on Xiao Yan’s guess, it was likely that this so called ninth Tianzun had likely reach the seven star or eight star level! The indifferent voice might cause old ghost Zhai Xing’s face to be ashamed but it was obvious that his life was even more important that his face. He hurriedly cried out, “Sir, save me!” The blue figure glanced faintly at Xiao Yan. After which, he knitted his pale blue eyebrows. He watched the black light sphere that rapidly spread over and muttered, “It is actually a Tian class Dou Technique. How envious…” The blue clothed figure swung his sleeve after uttering those words. The raindrop that scattered throughout the sky began to gather at a shocking speed. Within a short moment, it had gathered into a fast rotating rain scene in front of old ghost Zhai Xing. At the same time, his palm grabbed old ghost Zhai Xing’s shoulder and pulled back in a lightning like manner. Seeing that this person wished to rescue old ghost Zhai Xing, a chillness surged within Xiao Yan’s eyes. The Dou Qi within his body was poured out crazily and the speed at which the black light sphere spread also increased. Within a blink of an eye, it had collided with the rain curtain. “Crash!’ The two collided and the rain curtain immediately collapsed. Those rain droplets that permeated the sky were completely swallowed into the light sphere. The black light sphere broke through the rain curtain. Its speed increased instead of decreasing. After which, it quickly gave chase in front of old ghost Zhai Xing’s terrified eyes. The black light sphere directly reached old ghost Zhai Xing’s legs. “Ah!” When the black light sphere reached him, an extremely miserable scream was immediately erupted from old ghost Zhai Xing’s mouth “Humph!” That blue figure also snorted coldly. He ignored the miserable scream of old ghost Zhai Xing as he grabbed the latter’s shoulder and increased the speed at which he was pulling back. The blue figure’s speed increased and fled for some distance with old ghost Zhai Xing. He turned around and glanced at old ghost Zhai Xing’s legs, only to frown a little. At this moment, old ghost Zhai Xing’s legs were already completely broken. The spot where it broke was as smooth as mirror. Not even the slightest blood appeared. That manner was as though the blood from both of his legs were completely swallowed by the black light sphere during the momentary contact earlier. His eyes once again turned towards old ghost Zhai Xing’s face. It was already as pale as snow. Even his breathing had become a little sluggish. Having lost both legs and an arm, this old ghost Zhai Xing could basically be considered half crippled! “What an overbearing Tian class Dou Technique!” A slight solemness drew passed the blue figure’s face. Immediately, he shook his head. His toes pressed on the empty air and his body pulled back rapidly. Even with his strength, he did not wish to forcefully receive the Great Heaven Creation Palm. Even if he could receive it, it would cause him some losses. This was not something that he wished to see. “Even if you wish to leave, you will have to leave that old ghost behind!” Xiao Yan laughed coldly when he saw the blue figure’s fast speed. He suddenly clenched his hand. Vast and might Dou Qi spread. That black light sphere’s speed was also raised to its limit. It emitted a ‘swoosh’ sound and spread with lightning like speed. After which, it chased old ghost Zhai Xing, whose shoulder was grabbed by the blue figure, with a swift lightning like speed that one could not react fast enough. Finally, the it struck the chest portion of the latter in front of his incomparably terrified eyes. “Chi!” A soft sound appeared. Old ghost Zhai Xing widened eyes instantly solidified. Fresh blood slowly seeped out from the corner of his mouth. His face was as shrivelled as a withered tree. His life force had completely vanished in the blink of an eye. The light sphere swallowed the area below old ghost Zhai Xing’s chest and finally ceased extending due to it having reached its limit. Finally, it slowly vanished in front of countless number of horrified gazes. The blue figure had finally stopped the moment old ghost Zhai Xing lost his lifeforce. After which, his gaze coldly looked at the black light sphere that swiftly disappeared. Finally, his eyes paused on Xiao Yan at the middle of the light sphere. “You are indeed worthy of being a descendant of Xiao Xuan… this venerable self is a little curious as to why you are able to reach the Dou Zun level at such an age. Could it be the bloodline of the Xiao clan, which had already long been wasted, could be used again?” The blue figure looked at Xiao Yan and spoke faintly. Xiao Yan did not reply. His gaze merely glanced at the old man in front of him. The old man was wearing a blue robe. Even his hair and eyebrows were pale blue in colour. Both of his eyes appeared to be emitted an endless and mighty water affinity energy, causing one to feel a little absent-minded. This blue robed old man might appear ordinary but Xiao Yan understood that the strength of this old fellow was not any weaker than the Ancient Void Dragon Hei Qing, whom he had met back then. “It is likely not due to the bloodline. It was already incredible that this kind of wasted bloodline could groom an expert like Xiao Xuan. It is likely impossible to groom a second Xiao Xuan…” That blue clothed old man, who was addressed by old ghost Zhai Xing as ninth Tianzun, merely shook his head and muttered to himself in the face of Xiao Yan’s silence. “Wasted bloodline?” Xiao Yan frowned slightly and felt some doubt within his heart. From the meaning of this old fellow’s words, it seemed that the Xiao clan possessed a history that he was unaware of a long time ago. However, that whatever bloodline strength was something that he had never sense even a little of during all these years. Other than relying on the Flame Mantra to swallow Heavenly Flame, the reason that he was able to reach his current level was because of the accumulation of his own effort. There was no credit for the whatever bloodline strength. “It is fine if you have doubts. Someone will explain to you once you reach the Hall of Soul.” Ninth Tianzun laughed faintly after having appeared to see through Xiao Yan’s doubt. He glanced at old ghost Zhai Xing, who merely had the area above his chest remaining. After which, he slowly shook his head. A rich blue energy spread out from his palm. It subsequently wrapped around the remainder of old ghost Zhai Xing’s body before transforming into a blue icy crystal. With a flick of his hand, the ice crystal shattered. With a ‘bang’ it was blasted into countless fragments. Old ghost Zhai Xing’s body also turned into dust… “Although old ghost Zhai Xing had failed in a number of missions and ought to be punished, the one who should carry out this punishment is not you. Therefore, you must take some responsibility for his death.” Ninth Tianzun’s blue eyes looked at Xiao Yan and said. Xiao Yan laughed coldly. Dou Qi swiftly surged within his body. The Heavenly Flame also began to agglomerate within it. He was prepared to use all of his strength to fight with this ninth Tianzun. “I am aware that you possess a fire lotus that is comparable to a Tian class Dou Technique. However, this is insufficient. You will not get the chance to unleash such an attack in front of this venerable self. Therefore, you should just leave with this venerable self. My mission might be to bring you back alive but you can be considered alive as long as you have a breath left…” Ninth Tianzun gently flicked his long finger on his sleeve and spoke without expression. “I don’t believe it!” Xiao Yan’s eyes were narrowed slightly. He did indeed sense a kind of dangerous aura from ninth Tianzun. However, this was insufficient to get him to surrender without a fight. His shoulders immediately shook and the green red bone wings were extended. The wings were flapped and his body immediately pulled back explosively. Numerous afterimages appeared in the sky, causing one to be dazzled. Ninth Tianzun shook his head slowly when he saw Xiao Yan’s body pulling back. The space beside him slowly became distorted and his body disappeared in a strange fashion. The pores all over Xiao Yan’s body immediately stood up when ninth Tianzun disappeared. However, his eyes had just blink when he saw that blue figure was already less than two feet in front of him. “This venerable self has said that these… are useless.” Ninth Tianzun’s face was still indifferent. His right hand drifted out gently and the water Qi that permeated the sky gathered. Finally, it was accompanied by waves after waves of rich dark and cold energy. It rushed over towards Xiao Yan with lightning like speed. Ninth Tianzun’s palm flew over without warning. Xiao Yan’s expression swiftly became grave. The purple-brown flame hurriedly gathered on his right hand. Finally, it transformed into a meandering fire dragon that collided heavily with ninth Tianzun’s hand. “Chi!” The two collided. However, there was no earth-shaking sound. Heat and dark chillness interacted. It erupted into a dense white smoke and a sizzling sound resounded continuously. “Bang!” This interaction did not continue for long before a deep sound resounded within the fog. Immediately, a miserable figure staggered and flew out. Finally, it smashed heavily on a mountain wall. The frightening force directly caused an arm thick crack line to climb all over the hard mountain wall. “Grug!” Xiao Yan rubbed away the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth. He spat out the blood from his mouth as he looked at the blue figure in the sky with a gloomy expression. It was possible for him to put up a fight when facing old ghost Zhai Xing. However, he actually did not possess the strength to retaliate in the hands of this ninth Tianzun! “Leave with this venerable self…” Ninth Tianzun in the sky glanced at Xiao Yan. His body moved and he appeared in front of the latter. His palm was slowly extended and grabbed onto Xiao Yan’s shoulders. An indifferent voice was slowly emitted. Xiao Yan stared intently at ninth Tianzun, who had extended his hand over. A ruthlessness flashed within his eyes. Just when he was about to unleash all his strength and risk his life to attack, a hand was extended from behind him. It calmly grabbed ninth Tianzun hand. At the same time, a faint elderly voice also quietly spread from behind. “You, ninth Tianzun alone, is really unqualified to bring him away…” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1281","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
