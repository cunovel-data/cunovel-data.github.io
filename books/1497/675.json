Someone actually dared to hurl such insults at Yun Shan in the current Jia Ma Empire? A dark coldness gradually surge up Yun Fan’s face. He slowly raised his head and threw his gaze toward the sky like everyone else. However, everyone’s expression changed a little when their gazes looked at the ten plus enormous flying beast lingering in the sky. Who were these uninvited guest? Mu Tie also looked at the flying Magical Beast in the sky in alarm. He hurriedly waved his hand as he felt lost in this situation. The large group that was gathered behind him swarmed forward and surrounded him. Their gazes were cautious as they looked at those uninvited guests in the sky. “Everyone isn’t people from the Jia Ma Empire right?” Yun Fan’s expression was dark and cold as he looked at the ten plus Magical Beast in the sky. He coldly said, “This is our Misty Cloud Sect’s issue, I will advise all of you not to meddle in another’s business!” “Ke ke, it is indeed the Misty Cloud Sect.” A faint laugh was emitted again from the back of the Tiger Eagle Beast suspending in the sky after Yun Fan’s voice sounded. Immediately, some figures flashed and over ten human figures leaped down from the back of the beast and steadily landed in the yard. Yun Fan’s aura that had covered the entire city governor’s mansion immediately shrank like a torrent after these ten human figures landed. In merely an instant, it was completely suppressed back into his body and not even a little of it could seep out. Yun Fan’s expression immediately turned ugly at his aura being suppressed to such an extent. From this act of the other party, it was obvious that their strength far surpassed his. There were quite a number of people in the yard who sensed Yun Fan’s aura being suppressed. They immediately looked at one another. The caution in their hearts soared. As the saying goes, those who come have ill motives and those without would not come. It was likely that the manner today would not be easily resolved. Mu Tie softly ordered the surrounding troops to not act rashly. His gaze was cautious as he swept his gaze over the ten plus human figures who had leaped down from the Magical Beast. His sweeping gaze first paused on the body of a black-robed, young man who was standing right at the front. His gaze stared at the young face and Mu Tie became stunned. He faintly felt a familiar feeling. However, it was difficult for him to recall when he had interacted with such a strong person at this moment. While he was thinking in his heart, his gaze swiftly swept over the other people. A great storm gradually surged in his heart a moment later. He discovered that he was actually unable to see through the strength of all ten human figures who had appeared. There was only one reason for such a situation to happen. The strength of these people had far exceeded his! Mu Tie’s throat rolled a little. He merely felt that his mouth was completely dry. Over ten Dou Wang or stronger experts? This kind of frightening line-up… just where did these people come from? Why had he never heard even a little information about this? It would be quite a difficult thing for even the few neighboring empires to gather so many experts within a short period of time. Mu Tie’s expression was ugly but it was not much better for Yun Fan. This was because the latter had similarly discovered that even the weakest among these people would likely have a strength similar to his. The rest, like the black-robed, young man in the leader’s spot and the bewitching cold, glamourous, red-clothed beauty, caused him to feel a fear that came from deep within his heart. The entire front yard had descended into an unusual silence because of these uninvited guests. This included the members of the Misty Cloud Sect on the wall and Yun Fan. None of them dared to make any unusual movements. “May I know just who you are? The old me is Yun Fan, an Elder of the Misty Cloud Sect. Our sect leader is Yun Shan. Have you heard of him?” Yun Fan finally suppressed the shock within his heart some time later, and cupped his hands to the black-robed, young man who was occupying the leader’s spot. His voice was much more courteous and careful compared to before. Moreover, his intention of bring out Yun Shan’s name was undoubtedly to cause these people of unknown origin to feel some fear. “Yun Shan? I have heard of him… I also have quite the connection with him.” The black-robed, young man smiled. The corner of his mouth contained a teasing look. Yun Fan immediately sighed in relief when he heard this. Since the other party had heard of Yun Shan’s name, it was likely that they knew that he was an extremely powerful Dou Zong expert! The teasing look on the corner of the black-robed, young man’s mouth also widened when he saw Yun Fan’s relaxed manner. He slowly took two steps forward. When he moved forward, Mu Tie’s and Yun Fan’s groups hurriedly took a step back and looked at him with great caution. Xiao Yan turned his head over slightly. He threw his gaze on Mu Tie who was being heavily protected by his subordinates. The skin on Mu Tie’s head became numb when he saw the former’s eyes looking over. The arm which was tightly grabbing the enormous axe trembled. He could sense that he would likely not have the slightest chance to live if this mysterious black-robed, young man were to attack him. “Ke ke, big brother Mu Tie, there is no need to be anxious. I have been remembering the favor of you letting me escape back then.” The black-robed, young man laughed softly as he looked at the anxious Mu Tie. The words that he spoke caused both parties forces to immediately become stunned. Mu Tie’s face was similarly stunned because of the words of the black-robed, young man. His gaze immediately paused on the somewhat familiar face of the latter. A moment later, his gaze suddenly swept toward the enormous black ruler that the black-robed, young man was carrying on his back. A thought flashed in his head. The memory which had been hidden for three years was finally ruthlessly grabbed by him. “You… you… you are Xiao Yan?” A voice that contained disbelief amid some shock was transmitted from Mu Tie’s mouth. The two groups of people in the front yard once again became dull as Mu Tie’s face became stunned. Xiao Yan? A name which had gradually forgotten during these three years. Only until Mu Tie’s reminder did the certain matter and people from three years ago churn out in the minds of some of those present. Numerous dull gazes looked at the black-robed, young man carrying an enormous black ruler. At this moment, the face that had gained some additional maturity and the somewhat tender face back then slowly merged… “Xiao Yan? How is this possible? How can you still be alive?” Yun Fan had also turned dull because of the name that was emitted from Mu Tie’s mouth. A moment later, he became just like a cat that had had its tail stepped on as he screeched out in disbelief. The Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples on the wall also revealed shocked faces. Only at this moment did they understand what the meaning behind Xiao Yan’s earlier words about having quite a deep connection with Yun Shan. They did indeed have quite a deep connection between them. However, it was that of irreconcilable enemies! Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head as he looked at the various expressions of everyone in the yard. He smiled and spoke to Yun Fan, “That old dog Yun Shan is still alive. Why should I die?” Yun Fan’s face twitched. There was still a remnants of disbelief on his face. The culprit who had turned the Misty Cloud Sect into a big mess three years ago was actually still alive. Moreover, from the looks of it, this person’s strength had soared to a point that far exceeded his own. Yun Fan’s heart involuntarily leaped with great force when he thought of this. Only now did he understand why the Misty Cloud Sect Leader used the entire strength of the sect to chase after this young man who was only in his teens… this fellow’s growth potential was indeed too terrifying! “Kill him!” Yun Fan did not blink as he suddenly cried out in a ferocious manner. He could not let this fellow live! The ten plus Misty Cloud Sect’s disciple on the wall let out a stern cry after Yun Fan’s order sounded. However, their Dou Qi had just surged out when they heard the sharp sound of rushing wind. Instantly, sharp sword blades pierced out from their chests as bright-red blood seeped out. The life in their eyes swiftly disappeared. They tried to forcefully turn their heads around as their consciousnesses scattered. However, they only saw numerous cold faces that were filled with bloodthirstiness. “Pop! Pop!” One could only hear a muffled sound emitted when the corpses fell down the wall and smashed into the ground. Mu Tie’s face involuntarily twitched. His gaze vaguely glanced over the ten plus black figures that had unknowingly appeared on the wall. Shock immediately appeared in his heart. He could sense that the strength of all these black-clothed individuals were actually all at the peak of the Dou Ling class. Looking at the vicious tactics of killing with one strike, Mu Tie thought that it was likely that he would have a fifty-percent chance of dying in their hands if these ten plus people were to surround and attack him together. These people were basically the most outstanding forces which were not afraid to die! “Are these people all their subordinates… moreover there are those experts who have yet to intervene…” Mu Tie swallowed a mouthful of saliva. His gaze carried some shock as he looked at the black-robed, young man who was standing with a smile. His heart still held some disbelief. In just three short years, the person who was alone as he was chased out by the Misty Cloud Sect like a dog that had lost its home would actually possess such great strength! Yun Fan’s heart also pounded abruptly as he saw those elites that he had brought out from the sect being killed so easily. His gaze swept over the smiling young man and an uneasiness gradually surged within his heart. Today… “Blade Axe Company, attack!” A stern cry suddenly sounded from the mouth of Meng Li behind Yun Fan. At this moment, this fellow was looking at Xiao Yan with a savage face. It was unexpected that the thing he was about to obtain would be spoiled by this bastard. Since this was the case, he would kill all of them. “Bastard, you actually dare to privately maneuver the army?” Mu Tie immediately cried out angrily when he heard Meng Li’s cry. Meng Li laughed evilly. His gaze also became darker and more ruthless as he gradually heard the sound of orderly footsteps outside. Xiao Yan looked at Meng Li indifferently. He still remembered this person. Back then, he was blocked by this fellow when he was about to leave the Jia Ma Empire… Xiao Yan slowly raised his head and waved his hand and the ten plus enormous flying beast in the sky. “Hee hee, chief Xiao, you can leave these little shrimps to us. There is no need for you to worry about them.” A laugh sounded from the sky after Xiao Yan waved his hand. Immediately, numerous black shadows rushed down. Powerful Dou Qi immediately erupted outside the mansion along with the sound of blades colliding and miserable cries. After hearing the killing sound outside and seeing that not a single soldier had rushed in after awhile, the smile on Meng Li’s face gradually stiffened. He had placed thousands of soldiers outside. Yet from the looks of it now… A bloody stench slowly spread in from outside. A pale-whiteness and terror gradually surged on Yun Fan’s and Meng Li’s face. Xiao Yan glanced at the two of them and slowly stepped forward. His gentle voice, however, caused the bodies of both Yun Fan and Meng Li to feel icy-cold. “I will repay what the Misty Cloud Sect has done to the Xiao clan by over a hundred times. Today, I will begin with the both of you… relax, old dog Yun Shan will also go down and accompany you.” Mu Tie’s mind was somewhat absent-minded as he looked at the back of the black-robed, young man who was slowly walking. The words that were left behind by the young man who was miserably chased after three years ago suddenly sounded once again by his ears. “Help me inform Yun Shan. Within two years or at the very most five years, I, Xiao Yan will return!” “This fellow… actually… really did it.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-675","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
