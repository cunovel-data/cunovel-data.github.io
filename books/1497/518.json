However, there was not the slightest surprise on her bewitching face. Instead, she said with a cold smile, “I have long since sensed that this fellow had a strong person hidden by his side. So, it was actually a spiritual body.”\n Although she spoke in this manner with her mouth, her advancing footsteps were slowly withdrawn. This old man with an illusionary body in front of her gave her a faint oppressive feeling. This feeling was not weaker than the one Yun Shan gave back then. If she was at her peak condition, she would not fear him. At this moment, however, she needed to constantly separate some Spiritual Strength to suppress the spirit of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ in this body. With this split focus, her strength was somewhat reduced.\n Yao Lao smiled indifferently. He waved his hand and got Xiao Yan to step back a little. Only then did he smile and continue, “I am also clear about your current condition. Therefore, there is no need to show such a stern murderous aura in front of me. Although I am currently only in my spiritual state with a significant loss to my strength, it is likely that you will not gain any advantage if we were to really fight.”\n “Is that so?” Queen Medusa let out a cold laugh. However, she did not display any other motion with her hands. Clearly, the appearance of Yao Lao had given her a great shock.\n “I, too, don’t wish to have any conflict with you. It is just that it is not your right to randomly kill my disciple. If you feel that staying here displeases you, you can leave. No one will stop you.” Yao Lao smiled as spoke. His calm words similarly held a sharp edge. Back then, when he roamed the continent, forget about a Dou Zong, even an elite Dou Zun would have to be polite to him. This Queen Medusa may cause other people to fear her, but she did not pose the slightest threat to him.\n Queen Medusa frowned slightly when she heard this. Currently, the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ had the indication of recognizing Xiao Yan as its master. Moreover, she had not completely obtained control of this body. It was not up to her to decide whether to leave or not. Additionally, that medicinal formula for the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ was currently in Xiao Yan’s hand. She still needed to rely on his strength if she wanted that kind of medicinal pill to be refined. Therefore, why would she leave?\n “I have an agreement with him. If I protect him such that he could safely escape from Yun Shan’s hands, he will refine the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ for me. Now, however, he has already completely forgotten about that matter after nearly one year. What use is there to keep such a person, one does not keep his promise, around?” Queen Medusa coldly glanced at Xiao Yan as she spoke.\n The anxiety in Xiao Yan’s heart had been greatly reduced now that Yao Lao had shown himself. Hence, he merely helplessly spread his hands when he saw Queen Medusa’s ice-cold gaze. Big sister, did you really think that I am a fool? Was it not the case of the earlier I refine the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill,’ the faster I die?\n “Ke ke, if you did not have any killing intent in your heart, this disciple of mine would be extremely happy to help you search for medicinal ingredients. You cannot completely blame him for dragging things out in this manner.” Yao Lao smiled as he spoke. He naturally clearly knew about the matter from the beginning until the end.\n Queen Medusa snorted. She did not refute what Yao Lao said. Back then, she did have the thought of killing Xiao Yan with one slap once Xiao Yan refined the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill.’\n “Ke ke, Queen Medusa. I shall not waste my breath with you. Do you really want to obtain that ‘Thawing Spirit Pill?’” Yao Lao mused for a moment before he suddenly spoke after seeing the flickering eyes of Queen Medusa.\n “Isn’t this question of yours a little redundant?”\n “Since this is the case, we can each give the other party what we need. However, the precondition is that you must throw away those thoughts in your heart. No one can be blamed for the matter of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ following by Xiao Yan’s side. Moreover, even if it did recognize Xiao Yan as its master, it has nothing to do with you. No outsiders can do anything to change it.” Yao Lao smiled and continued, “If you can throw aside the killing intent in your heart, I can guarantee you that I will place a completely refined ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ in front of you within one year. However, in exchange, you must protect my disciple such that his life will not be in danger for one year after you have obtained the medicinal pill. What do you say?”\n “He and I already have a prior agreement before this. Back then, I protected him such that he escaped from Yun Shan’s hand. Otherwise, do you think he could even think of challenging Yun Shan with his strength? Since I have already completed my agreement, he should help me refine the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill.’ Why should I come into another agreement with you?” Queen Medusa’s voice faintly contained a thread of anger.\n “Both parties violated that agreement back then. Naturally, it is invalid.” Yao Lao said faintly.\n “You want to get me to be a guard for him for a year? Forget it!” Queen Medusa’s cold voice did not hesitate as she opened her mouth and rejected the suggestion.\n “Since this is the case, you can go and find someone else to refine the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill.’” Yao Lao rolled his eyes as he replied.\n “In that case, give the medicinal formula for the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ to me!” Queen Medusa clenched her silver teeth as she coldly spoke.\n “Ke ke, that won’t do. This ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ is something that Xiao Yan obtained after spending great effort to win the Alchemist Grand Meeting. How can he give it to you?” Yao Lao smiled and shook his head.\n Xiao Yan was a little stunned as he eyed Yao Lao in front of him from behind. Currently, the latter had a little aura of a thug.\n Queen Medusa inhaled a deep breath of air as her expression gradually became gloomy. Originally, she was someone who did not like to waste her breath. If it was not because she was afraid of Yao Lao’s strength, it was likely that she would have attacked and killed him. However, the stubborness of the current Yao Lao caused a killing intent to once again surge in her heart.\n As Queen Medusa’s expression became gloomy, a majestic Qi that shocked Xiao Yan slowly surged out from her body. Under this powerful force, the surrounding air basically ceased flowing at this moment.\n Turning everything silent. This was the overbearingness and great strength of an elite Dou Zong.\n However, Yao Lao’s body did not make the slightest movement under the suppression of this majestic force. Only a cold sharp look gradually swarmed onto his indifferent old face. An invisible Spiritual Strength extended out and densely covered half of the sky. Although Yao Lao was unable to use Dou Qi in his spiritual form, his spirit was unusually powerful due to him being an alchemist. On top of this, he had the assistance of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame.’ He had even reached the state where he could just rely on his Spiritual Strength to fight with other people. Of course, he would naturally be unable to reach the level at his peak by just using Spiritual Strength. However, it would not be too much of a problem when it was used to fight with Queen Medusa, who was similarly not in her peak condition.\n Two similarly powerful forces gradually surged on the top of this mountain. The ground shook a little between the suppression of these two forces, and it actually began to gradually form some crack lines under Xiao Yan shocked gaze.\n Following the flow of time, the two forces grew increasingly strong. However, the instant Queen Medusa could no longer resist attacking, her face suddenly changed. The tense atmosphere also fell apart at this moment. Her delicate hand held her forehead as her expression changed swiftly. A seven-colored glow was repeatedly surging out from within her body.\n “Dammit!” Queen Medusa clenched her teeth with all her strength as she viciously scolded. The ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ had actually come out to snatch control of the body at such a time. Moreover, this time around, it actually resisted so intensely, causing her to have no choice but to hurriedly agglomerate her strength to suppress it. However, in this way, how would she be able to fight Yao Lao.\n Xiao Yan appeared to have understood something when he saw this condition of Queen Medusa. He immediately sighed in relief within his heart. This woman’s strength was a little overly frightening. Even if Yao Lao was able to defeat her, it was likely that he would descend into a slumber due to over-exhaustion of his Spiritual Strength. Although Xiao Yan currently did not rely on Yao Lao as much as he did in the past, Yao Lao’s rich experience would enable him to save himself from a lot of trouble no matter how one put it.\n The seven-colored glow grew increasingly intense. In the end, even Queen Medusa’s bewitching eyes became slightly at a loss.\n Queen Medusa inhaled a deep breath of air and did her best to suppress the rebound of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python.’ She coldly eyed Yao Lao on the opposite side and unwillingly said, “Alright, we will do as you say. If you are able to give me the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ within one year, I will protect him for one year. If you make empty promises with me once again, this Queen will let you all suffer heavy losses even if I risk the retaliation of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python.’”\n “Ke ke, it is naturally for the best like this. I will definitely hand over the ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ within one year. However, the old me hopes that Queen Medusa would not be like you are the last time where you have killing intent in your heart. Otherwise, I will turn the body that you have great difficulty evolving into into ashes even if I risk falling into a slumber!” Yao Lao laughed softly. His laugher did indeed contain an extremely rich threat. After his words sounded, a dense, white-colored flame surged explosively from his body and immediately wrapped around it in order to increase his might.\n The dense white-colored flame rose slowly. Although the flame was rising strongly, it ultimately gave a person a kind of strange icy-cold feeling when one looked at it.\n “Heavenly Flame?” Queen Medusa’s face changed a little when she saw that dense white-colored flame. Her gaze changed quite a lot. Having once suffered under the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame,’ she naturally clearly knew just how frightening this kind of flame was. Although this dense white-colored flame in front of her did not have the heat of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ on its surface, the kind of strange visual feeling from it caused Queen Medusa to be afraid of underestimating it.\n “As long as the both of you don’t break your promises once again, this Queen will naturally keep her promise. I hope that I will be able to see a true ‘Thawing Spirit Pill’ the next time that I wake up.” Queen Medusa responded indifferently. The seven-colored glow within her body suddenly erupted. Her body once again moved. A moment later, the bewitching, enchanting, all-around stunning creature once again transformed back into that small seven-colored snake that was merely over a foot long.\n The ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ which had transformed back into its snake’s form shook its tail a little. Its body appeared by Xiao Yan’s side as fast as lightning. It extended and withdrew its snake’s tongue at the latter. There appeared to be some human-like concern within those bewitching snake eyes.\n “Ke ke, I am fine.” Xiao Yan rubbed the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ in a tender manner as he spoke with a bitter smile, “Little fellow, it’s all thanks to you. Otherwise, I’m afraid that a hard battle would have been unavoidable.”\n “However, we have at least said all that needs to be said. In the future, we will no longer need to worry about whether she will suddenly come and kill me. Queen Medusa may be cold and heartless, but she is extremely proud. It is unlikely that she will go back against her words.” Yao Lao turned around and smiled as he spoke to Xiao Yan.\n “Hopefully that will be the case.” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He flicked his hand and took out the bottle of true ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ once more. He softly said, “Whether I am able to breakthrough to the Dou Ling class in one go is really up to this thing…”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-518","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
