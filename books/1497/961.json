{"id":47595,"no":961,"title":"Chapter 961: Fight","content":"Chapter 961: Fight “The Han clan should have a reason behind their actions. After all, this match concerns the rest of Han Yue’s life…” Private conversations around the arena suddenly sounded the moment Xiao Yan appeared. Numerous shocked gazes repeatedly swept over his body. Hong Li’s brows were knitted slightly as he looked at the unfamiliar Xiao Yan from the seats of the Hong clan. With his understanding of the Han clan, the other party would definitely not randomly find someone to die for them in this kind of situation. However, if this was not the case, could this young man really contend with Hong Chen? There was an old man wearing gray-colored robes beside Hong Li. The old man had his eyes shut, seemingly ignoring the noise of the outside world. His hands were hidden under his sleeves while his body leaned against the backrest of the chair. There was a green-silver-colored badge on his chest. A tower with a faint lightning glow lingering over it was drawn on the badge. The old man opened his shut eyes upon hearing Hong Li’s words. He glanced at Xiao Yan before using a hoarse voice to faintly speak, “This little fellow is also very strong. I wonder where the Han clan found such a helper.” “Oh? Will Hong Chen be able to defeat him?” Hong Li became a little stern upon hearing this. By being able to get this old fellow to evaluate him like this, it seemed that this young man with an ordinary appearance was really not a scapegoat that the Han clan had sent out. “Most of the high class Dou Techniques of my Wind Lightning Pavilion has been learned by Hong Cheng. Moreover, the Qi Method which he practices is also a top Qi Method of my Wind Lightning Pavilion. Forget about those of similar levels. His fighting strength could fight with even experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class. There are indeed people of the same generation who could defeat him in the Central Plains. However, such a person has not appeared in Tian Bei City.” The old man once again slowly shut his eyes upon saying these words. Hong Li’s heart sighed in relief after hearing the gray-robed, old man speak in this manner. His face revealed a cold smile. He wanted to see just how ugly the expression on Han Chi’s face would be after being defeated. Hong Che’s eyes lazily swept over Xiao Yan on the enormous stone arena. He said, “Tell me your name.” Xiao Yan smiled. He ignored this fellow’s arrogant words and softly laughed, “A nameless individual, Xiao Yan, who cannot be compared with the great reputation of young master Hong Chen.” “Don’t pay lip service to this father of yours. I will give you ten breath’s time to decide if you wish to get lost by yourself or for me to turn you into a cripple and toss you away.” Hong Chen’s face turned cold as he cried out. “There is no need for ten breaths. Let’s just fight…” Xiao Yan shook his head. His face was completely harmless. This Hong Chen was indeed as arrogant as the people around had described. Hong Chen’s eyes turned gloomy. He stared at Xiao Yan sinisterly and said, “Since you wish to seek death, do not blame this young master for not showing mercy.” Numerous lightning glows suddenly surged from Hong Chen’s body the moment his voice sounded. Finally, they transformed into a layer of lightning glow that wrapped around his entire body. “Lightning Dou Qi huh…” Xiao Yan looked at the deep-silver-colored Dou Qi that covered Hong Chen. Countless numbers of silver snakes of lightning leaped in all directions. Clearly, this fellow practiced a lightning affinity Qi Method that was known for its powerful offensive strength. “Remember my name, Hong Chen. Being defeated by my hands will be your honor!” Hong Chen gave a sneer and suddenly stomped down. A lightning bolt the size of an arm shot towards Xiao Yan from the ground, moving like a snake. Xiao Yan raised his head slightly as he looked at the lightning glow that extended over in a snake-like manner. He raised his eyes slightly and his foot gently stepped forward. A flame-like jade-green Dou Qi also shot out before colliding with the lightning glow. A sudden muffled sound appeared and the enormous rock where the collision occurred ended up with half-a-foot large hole. “Just attack. Young master Hong Chen, do not take little tricks out…” Xiao Yan laughed faintly as he spoke. “Hei, you are actually even more arrogant than this young master. In that case, we will see if you have the qualification to allow me to use all my strength!” Hong Chen’s eyes turned cold. A bright, silver glow suddenly erupted and his body appeared in front of Xiao Yan in the blink of an eye in ghost-like manner. A fist with bright lightning light carried a ‘chi chi’ wind sound as it violently smashed toward Xiao Yan’s head. The wild and violent lightning strength that came toward Xiao Yan caused his eyelids to raise. His feet randomly shifted left and the fist that was covered in a lightning glow narrowly flew past his ear. Hong Chen merely smiled coldly when Xiao Yan dodged his attack. His fist was suddenly spread out and his five fingers were curled into a strange claw-shape. They violently tore toward Xiao Yan’s shoulder. The hand-claw was suddenly waved down before it stilled. One could see that two of Xiao Yan’s fingers covered in a dense Dou Qi were piercing the palm of the hand-claw like a dagger, completely stopping the force on it. “You have some skill.” Surprised also surfaced on Hong Chen’s face when his attack was stopped. Suddenly he cried out coldly, “Try the Wind Lightning Pavilion’s Wind Lightning Claw!” The cry had just sounded when a lightning glow surged on his hand-claw. A couple of lightning glows bent in a strange manner before agglomerating into an extremely sharp lightning claw above his finger. Hong Chen cried out furiously when the hand claw was formed. The energy on the hand claw soared and it forced Xiao Yan’s fingers back. The hand claw carried an extremely sharp lightning strength as it furiously hacked down! This hacking tore the air apart. A blurry silver-colored hand-claw afterimage appeared in the sky. Xiao Yan also felt somewhat surprised in his heart upon sensing the sharpness of the wind claw. His fingers changed swiftly before he suddenly clenched his hand. Immediately, jade-green Dou Qi carrying a thread of flame appeared and violently collided with Hong Chen. “Bang!” Hong Chen’s body was a little dull when this deep sound appeared. He swiftly recovered and a fierceness flashed across his eyes. The two claws suddenly danced and numerous after images appeared in a dazzling manner. The sharp wind from the claws swiftly covered Xiao Yan’s entire body. A whistling sound appeared and repeatedly reverberated over the arena. Xiao Yan’s expression remained impassive in the face of this wild and violent attack by Hong Chen. His hand was curled and immediately formed a defense in front of his body. With the help of his Spiritual Perception, the genuine attacks of Hong Chen did not escape Xiao Yan’s detection regardless of how fast the attacking speed was. Hence, each time a claw wind, that contained a killing intent, headed over, it would be violently sent back by Xiao Yan with a punch. Both parties claws and fists repeatedly formed numerous afterimages in front of them. This caused the countless number of people watching the stage to exclaim out loud. No one expected that Xiao Yan would be able to remain undefeated after having so many exchanges with Hong Chen. “Wind Lightning Kill!” A serious expression finally surfaced in Hong Chen’s eyes after his attacks were blocked many times. The underestimation in his heart was also lessened a little. His claw immediately changed as he let out a furious cry. A faint lightning roar suddenly sounded. The many hand-claw afterimages suddenly stilled at this moment before swiftly shrinking back. Within a short period of time, a hand claw covered by a dense lightning claw strangely appeared along with a faint thunder roar. It carried a lightning-like momentum as it violently grabbed at Xiao Yan’s heart. From the look of this momentum, it was likely that Xiao Yan’s heart would be dug out if he was struck. Xiao Yan exhaled gently before taking a step back. A stern coldness suddenly surged into his dark-black eyes. An incomparably powerful Dou Qi surged out like floodwaters from within his body in all directions. At this moment, Xiao Yan had completely displayed his seven star Dou Huang strength. The expressions of the countless of people present changed upon sensing the powerful Dou Qi, that suddenly surged out of Xiao Yan’s body. An exclamation resounded like a wave. “Dou Huang?” “This person’s strength is likely even stronger than Han Yue from the Han clan right? No wonder…” Xiao Yan’s clenched his fist tightly as the Dou Qi surged. It paused for a moment before it was instantly thrown out. “Octane Blast!” The strength of the fist suddenly soared by a couple of times while it was still traveling. An ear-piercing sonic boom resounded around the fist. The fist violently collided with Hong Chen’s lightning claw amid many shocked eyes. “Bang!” A low, deep collision sound abruptly appeared. Powerful air ripples surged out from the point of contact. Numerous spider-web-like cracks also spread on the enormous large rocks around. A human figure suddenly shot past while the crack lines spread. His feet rubbed against the ground and formed an obvious scar that was over a dozen meters long. Everyone’s eyes hurriedly looked over and they involuntarily inhaled a breath of cool air. The person who was forced back was actually Hong Chen? A countless number of gazes slide away after lingering on Hong Chen for a moment. All of them paused on the young man who had merely taken two steps back. The shock within their eyes grew even denser. This person had actually gain the upper hand in a head-on collision with Hong Chen? Just what great being was this fellow? Xiao Yan waved his sleeves gently and his finger pressed on his arm in a lightning-like manner. The finger was flicked and a wild and violent lightning strength was tossed out of his body. “You actually think that this little lightning hidden force would be able to harm me?” Hong Chen, who had stabilized his body, currently possessed an unusually sinister face. He looked at Xiao Yan in a gloomy manner and said, “Unexpectedly you are also a seven star Dou Huang. You have hidden quite deeply. No wonder the Han clan has looked for you. You do possess the qualification to be my opponent, but the strength that you have displayed is far from sufficient if you wish to beat me!” A low, deep roar was suddenly emitted from Hong Chen’s throat when his voice sounded. Immediately, a crackling sound appeared from within his body. Countless silver-snake-like lightning bolts extended from his bones, wrapping him within a layer of lightning. Being within a lightning web, Hong Chen’s aura also swiftly soared. “Seeing that you are able to force back this young master, I shall let you take a look at the secret technique of the Wind Lightning Pavilion today!” “Lightning God Descend!” Hong Chen’s feet suddenly stomped down and countless numbers of silver snakes surged out from under his feet. Within a short instant, it permeated the area within a radius of hundreds of feet. Hong Chen, who was within it, appeared like a lightning god. His aura was terrifying! The expressions of everyone in the Han clan changed when they saw that Hong Chen had actually used the Lightning God Descend. Han Xue and Han Yue also exchanged looks. They were able to see a little worry from the other party’s eyes. However, when their gazes looked to Xiao Yan, they merely saw him with his usual calmness. His emotions did not sway even a little because of Hong Chen’s transformation… Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-961","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
