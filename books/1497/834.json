{"id":47468,"no":834,"title":"Chapter 834: Two Women’s Hidden Act","content":"Chapter 834: Two Women’s Hidden Act When the first rays of the morning sunlight appeared the next day, the Black Emperor City, which had been quiet for the night, once again became noisy. Countless numbers of people began to gather in this city from the outside. The influence and attraction that had been created from the large-scale auction the Black Emperor Sect was holding this year could be considered the greatest within the ‘Black-Corner Region’ in a century. The promotion by the Black Emperor Sect and the mystery of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva caused some extremely powerful people, who had not shown their faces in the ‘Black-Corner Region’ for a long time, to make an exception and leave their retreats. Their destination was naturally the Black Emperor City, which had currently become the focus of attention within the ‘Black-Corner City’. Quite a few people with keen senses faintly sensed a feeling of the calm before the storm that was quietly brewing within the Black Emperor City with so many experts currently gathering. This time around, it was likely that the Black-Corner City would erupt into a soul-stirring big battle that had never been seen in the last hundred years. Xiao Yan, who was seated cross-legged on the bed slowly opened his eyes when the morning sunlight radiated in. After one night of recuperation, his condition had already reached his peak. Dou Qi flowed like a mountain stream and the feeling of strength covered his limbs. It was as though his body would transform into a human-shaped machine as long as it moved, destroying everything around him. Xiao Yan leaped down from the bed and slowly walked out of his room. He saw that the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan were already waiting in the living room. “When will you begin refining pills?” The Little Fairy Doctor was able to sense the powerful circulation of Dou Qi in Xiao Yan’s body the moment the latter appeared. She naturally knew that Xiao Yan had recuperated for an entire night in order to refine pills today. “I will begin now. The both of you needs to help protect me. Don’t allow anyone to disturb me. The medicinal pills that I will be refining this time around are not ordinary. It is likely that quite a big commotion will be created when a pill is formed. There are many experts in this Black Emperor Pavilion and it is likely difficult to completely hide everything.” Xiao Yan spoke with a somewhat solemn expression. “Yes.” The Little Fairy Doctor nodded slightly upon seeing Xiao Yan’s expression. Xiao Yan randomly washed himself after giving some instructions. He had just entered the chamber when a knocking sound appeared from the door. Xiao Yan’s group was startled when they heard the knocking. They immediately knit their brows. They were not familiar with the others in this Black Emperor Pavilion. Who would come and find them at this time? Xiao Yan slowly walked forward while carrying some doubt. He slowly pulled open the door, only to see a white-clothed person standing haughtily at the entrance. It was actually that Junior Sect Leader of the Black Emperor Sect, Mo Ya. A smile surged onto Mo Ya’s face when he saw Xiao Yan open the door. He immediately cupped his hands toward Xiao Yan in a polite manner and said, “Brother Yan Xiao, I am really sorry for intervening yesterday. In order to express my remorse, I am planning to lead the three of you on a tour around the city. You can just tell me if there is any place you wish to go.” A strange expression immediately surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face when he heard this. This fellow did indeed have some thoughts for the Little Fairy Doctor. He might say that he was leading the three of them out for a walk, but his real intentions could not escape Xiao Yan’s notice. “I’m sorry, today…” XIao Yan shook his head slightly. He was just about to voice his rejection when a small lovely figure suddenly rushed out from behind him. Immediately, a small fist that carried an ear-piercing sonic boom ruthlessly smashed toward Mo Ya. The person who suddenly sprinted forth was naturally Zi Yan. However, Xiao Yan did not stop her when he saw this. He was a little concerned about this Mo Ya. This person was able to have such achievement at such a young age. It was likely that his skill was not weak and it was good to allow Zi Yan to go forward and test his skills. Mo Ya’s expression changed slightly in the face of the sudden sneak attack by Zi Yan. No one within the Dou Huang class would dare to randomly slight the terrifying strength of Zi Yan. He immediately took one hurried step back and curled his arm. The strange skill that was similar to yesterday was again displayed by him. Both of his hands were like catfish as they gently caught Zi Yan’s arm. After which, both of his hands were rotated in a strange manner, forming a mysterious arc. The frightening strength on Zi Yan’s fist was swiftly reduced while the arc rotated. “Hmph!” Zi Yan, who was prepared, immediately let out a cold snort as she sensed that strange feeling again like yesterday. She once again tightly clenched her little hand. A dense purple glow lingered over her arms without a care for anything. Her arm shook, and her fist smashed toward the strange ring that Mo Ya had formed. Mo Ya was greatly surprised when Zi Yan’s fist escaped his control. His toes pressed on the ground and his body transformed into an illusionary figure that swiftly flashed back. “Bang!” Zi Yan’s tightly clenched fist suddenly opened while Mo Ya’s figure was swiftly retreating. The frightening strength that lingered over her fist immediately escaped her hand in a strange manner. Finally, it gnawed through the air and suppressed the air into a football-sized bubble as it violently smashed into Mo Ya’s body. “Bang!” The air bubble exploded and a sharp sound rang out. Mo Ya’s legs were dragged over the ground as he took over ten hurried steps back. Only then did he forcefully stop his body. However, his neat white clothes was already in tatters at this moment. Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. Being an observer, he could clearly sense that a layer of tiny energy ripples had strangely appeared on his skin just as the invisible air bubble struck Mo Ya. It was this layer of energy ripples that swallowed most of the strength of the air bubble. Otherwise, being struck by Zi Yan’s fist would not be a matter that would end with just his clothes in tatters. “Zi Yan, comeback!” Xiao Yan softly cried out. He halted Zi Yan with a cry. Only then did the latter lick her small mouth, having not gotten enough of a fight. She coldly glared at the somewhat ugly Mo Ya before swaggering into the room. After that punch earlier, the resentment that she had suffered earlier had completely disappeared. Although Mo Ya’s strength-reducing technique was mysterious, it was clearly unable to completely eliminate her strength. “He he, junior sect leader, this child is mischievous and immature. We have offended you.” Xiao Yan smiled and glanced at Mo Ya. Without waiting for the other party’s reply after having spoken, he continued, “I still have other matters to attend to today and cannot go out. We’ll ask Junior Sect Leader to lead us around if there is a chance in the future.” Xiao Yan withdrew to his room after speaking. After which, he shut the door tightly in the face of Mo Ya’s green expression. Mo Ya’s expression was ugly as he stared at the tightly shut door outside. He did not expect that he would be beaten this badly today. Not only did he fail to meet the Little Fairy Doctor, but he was turned into such a miserable state by the little girl with brute strength. “Yan Xiao, huh? Alright, alright, this young master will remember!” Mo Ya clenched his teeth and cursed in his heart. He violently swung his sleeves, turned his body and left with a dark, solemn expression. Within the room, Xiao Yan recalled Mo Ya’s green face and involuntarily gave a slight smile. He never had a good impression of this person. By using Zi Yan’s hand to teach him a lesson today, he could be considered to have vented his anger. “Hopefully, this fellow will not come and find trouble. Otherwise, once these things are over…” “The two of you should stay in the room today and ignore anyone. There is no need to be merciful should there really be someone who breaks the door to enter!” Xiao Yan gently exhaled and spoke in a deep voice. “Relax, there will not be anyone who will disturb you.” The Little Fairy Doctor smiled faintly as she replied. Xiao Yan vaguely nodded. He once again told them a couple more things before turning around and entering a secret chamber. After which, the heavy door was closed with a cracking sound. It carried a wave of dust as it was slowly shut. The Little Fairy Doctor turned her head after seeing Xiao Yan enter the secret chamber. She looked at Zi Yan who was secretly laughing with her hands covering her little mouth as she slightly smiled. She softly said, “Have you used the thing that I gave you?” “Yes, I used a hidden force to transmit that thing into his body when we exchanged blows earlier.” Zi Yan laughed. “That is good. Everything will naturally be fine if this person is tactful. If he really uses some tactics, I will let him suffer a fate worse than death.” The corner of the Little Fairy Doctor’s mouth was slowly lifted into a slight arc. Her voice was soft and gentle but it contained a chillness. If that pitiful Mo Ya were to know that he had been secretly poisoned without reason after only attempting to approach the Little Fairy Doctor, it was likely that he would involuntarily vomit a mouthful of blood. Xiao Yan sat cross-legged on a rock bed within the secret chamber. There were around ten plus jade containers placed in front of him. The jade containers were emitting a rich medicinal fragrance. One look and one could tell that they were not ordinary things. These medicinal ingredients were those that Xiao Yan’s group had found in mountain forests during their half a year of travel. They were extremely rare items and their value would not be any lower than the last three medicinal ingredients that Xiao Yan had purchased in the Thousand Medicinal House. The medicinal pill that Xiao Yan wished to refine this time around was named ‘Zong Breaking Pill’. This kind of medicinal pill could be considered top grade among the tier 6 medicinal pills. Its effect could cause many experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class to desire it. This medicinal pill did not have the effect of raise one’s strength. However, it was able to allow an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class to have a ten-percent greater success rate when advancing to a Dou Zong. Moreover, it guaranteed that the person consuming it would be able to stabilize his or her strength before he or she attempted to break through to the Dou Zong class. Even if the attempt failed, there would not be a situation where his or her level dropped! It was common knowledge that the success rate of a Dou Huang attempting to advance to a Dou Zong was quite low. Moreover, there was a great amount of risk. Once the attempt at breaking through failed, the Dou Qi ripple within one’s body might be too intense if that person was not careful. This would result in the most tragic thing, a decline of one’s level. This was the thing that caused almost every expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class to be extremely afraid. At their level, they would need to exhaust a large amount of time and effort to retrain should their strength decline by even a little. This was undoubtedly the most frightening thing to them. Therefore, the Zong Breaking Pill possessed a fatal attraction to Dou Huangs. Although that ten-percent might seem very low, this ten-percent was enough to cause a countless number of expert Dou Huangs to sacrifice many things in order to obtain it. This Zong Breaking Pill would be one of Xiao Yan’s top cards when he attempted to bid for the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva!
