After which, their eyes instantly focused on the door.\n A white-haired figure slowly stepped out after the door was opened. At this moment, Han Li was knitting his eyebrows. He shook his head and softly sighed.\n Joy immediately surfaced on the gray-clothed old woman’s face when she saw how Han Li acted. After which, her eyes turned to the area behind Han Li. Xiao Yan’s skinny figure was slowly appearing at that spot. All the gazes within the room immediately paused on his chest when he appeared. That spot… was currently still empty…\n “Tsk tsk…”\n A mocking expression quickly surged on the gray-clothed, old woman’s face after she failed to see any tier badge on Xiao Yan’s chest. A proud laugh was involuntarily emitted from her throat.\n That white-clothed, cold lady by the gray-clothed, old woman’s side also lifted the corner of her mouth. She slowly shook her head. This person was indeed a clown who only knew how to act great. It was funny that she had really waited here for half a day.\n That old man from the Qiu clan also shook his head. His eyes contained some pity as he glanced at Ye Zhong. This Ye clan really appeared to be finished…\n Ye Zhong merely frowned in the face of the gazes within the room that were filled with various emotions. However, his expression was not as pale as the others had imagined. He was clearly aware of Xiao Yan’s ability. Although he did not dare to say he was hundred percent confident that Xiao Yan could obtain a tier 7 middle grade alchemist badge, he was, at the very least, eighty percent confident. Moreover, looking at Xiao Yan’s expression, it did not appear to be that of someone who had failed…\n “Hee hee, trash is trash. No matter how one jumps, one will only be a clown. The Ye clan is finished…”\n The gray-clothed, old woman’s ear-piercing laughter sounded within the room. The joy within her heart at seeing Xiao Yan fail was really not something that could be described by mere words.\n Han Li frowned in the face of the sharp laughter from the gray-clothed, old woman. He focused on her and faintly said, “It is a little too early for you to be happy. Who told you that he has failed the test?”\n Han Li’s voice had halted the laughter of the gray-clothed, old woman. Her face immediately became a little volatile as she coldly laughed, “Deacon Han, there is no need to give any face to Ye Zhong. If this brat has passed the test, why is it that I cannot see his tier badge?”\n Han Li looked at this gray-clothed, old woman somewhat pitifully. He shook his head and said, “He has already successfully passed the test for the tier 7 middle grade level. The reason why I did not give him the tier badge is because the old me feels that he should be able to get an even higher level badge. Therefore, I am debating on if I should let him head to the Pill Tower headquarters to take another test.”\n Han Li’s voice was undoubtedly as if a bolt of lightning had exploded on the ground. It caused everyone’s faces to instantly stiffen. Their gazes of disbelief were gathered onto Xiao Yan’s face\n The white-clothed lady in particular was full of disbelief. The expression on her face was extremely interesting…\n “Deacon Han, we should forget about the matter of heading to the headquarters to be tested…” Xiao Yan appeared to have not witnessed the stiffened faces as he spoke to Han Li in front of him.\n Han Li was startled upon hearing this. He could only nod his head as he took out a dazzling badge from his Storage Ring. After which, he courteously handed it to Xiao Yan. He smiled and said, “Since you insist, we will do as you say. If you have the time, I advise you to head to the Pill Tower to be tested. I believe that you have that ability.”\n Xiao Yan randomly flipped the badge after receiving it. This badge was dark with vigor. There was a flame burning on the badge. An enormous tower was within the flame. The tower had seven purple-gold bright stars on it. However, the seventh star was a little dimmer than the others.\n Numerous gazes within the room were startled as they looked at the dazzling badge that Xiao Yan was flipping around in his hand. The room immediately became completely silent. Tier 7 middle grade. Not even that gray-clothed, old woman, the old man from the Qiu clan, or even Han Li had ever reached that tier. Now, however… this badge that represented glory had landed in the hands of Xiao Yan, who appeared to be an extremely young man…\n Ye Zhong face was filled with smiles. He fondled his beard, especially when he saw the interesting expressions of the gray-clothed, old woman and the others. Joy that was difficult to describe surged out of his heart. Ever since the decline of the Ye clan, it had been a long time since he had seen these fellows reveal such expressions…\n The gray-clothed old woman’s face was volatile as she looked at the badge in Xiao Yan’s hand. A moment later, she finally could not resist uttering, “Deacon Han, issuing tier badges is not a joke. Are you certain that there is nothing wrong with the test?”\n Han Li’s expression sank upon hearing her words. He demanded, “Are you doubting that the old me has tampered with it?”\n The gray clothed old woman hurriedly smiled upon seeing Han Li’s sunken face. “How would I dare? However, it is just that I find it difficult that the Ye clan, which has declined to such an extent, would be able to produce such a young tier 7 alchemist.”\n The white-clothed lady beside the gray-clothed old woman also slowly recovered. Her eyes were complicated and strange as she glanced at Xiao Yan. Her contempt had already completely disappeared at this moment. Although she was at the tier 6 high grade level, she clearly understood just what kind of great gap was between her and a tier 7 alchemist. Moreover, this Xiao Yan was a tier 7 middle grade alchemist…\n Under this tier 7 middle grade alchemist badge, all of her pride was not even worth mentioning!\n A person they had mocked since the beginning received a test result that far surpassed them. This was equivalent to giving all of them a tight slap to their faces, causing them to feel a fiery pain.\n “Hee, what is there to be proud of. He is just a tier 7 middle grade alchemist. I do not believe that he can rescue your Ye clan…”\n The gray-clothed, old woman could not resist mocking after seeing the smile on Ye Zhong’s face. However, she did not sense her words containing an exceptionally dense sourness.\n “Let’s go.”\n The gray-clothed, old woman did not intend to stay any longer after being turned into an ashen state by the tier 7 middle grade badge. She let out a cold cry, turned around, and left.\n “Wait…”\n The gray-clothed, old woman had just turned around when a faint voice suddenly sounded. Her footsteps paused as she turned around. Her eyes contained a cold smile as she looked at Xiao Yan and said, “Brat, are you intending to see the old me out?”\n “You have just said that I am trash, right?”\n A slight smile was present on Xiao Yan’s face as he looked at the gray-clothed, old woman. He softly asked.\n The gray-clothed, old woman narrowed her eyes. A chill flashed across them as she said, “Young fellow, don’t tell me that you don’t allow others to say anything about you? It looks like the teachings of the Ye clan have indeed become worse and worse…”\n Xiao Yan slowly shook his head. His foot gently stepped forward and the muffled sound of thunder appeared. His body suddenly disappeared in the process.\n The face of the old woman changed the moment Xiao Yan’s body disappeared. She flipped her sleeves and a majestic Dou Qi surged out of her body. Her dark and dense eyes swept all around her.\n “Bang!”\n The low and deep sound of rushing wind materialized from behind the gray-clothed, old woman just as her body was pulling back. Her face turned cold as she turned around and threw a punch forward. A vast and mighty force lingered over her fist, causing waves of ripples to be form in the space.\n The fist from the gray-clothed, old woman had just been thrown out when the space in front of her fluctuated. A simple punch penetrated through the space and ruthlessly collided with her fist.\n “Bang!”\n A powerful wind ripple surged out when the two fists collided, shaking the gray-clothed, old woman’s group until they hurriedly pulled back.\n “Grug!”\n The face of the gray-clothed, old woman turned pale almost instantly after the two fists collided. Shock surfaced on her face. Immediately, a mouthful of fresh blood was spat out. Her body flew backwards and finally collided with a wall.\n With the exception of Ye Zhong, everyone in the room revealed stunned faces upon seeing the gray-clothed, old woman spitting out blood in defeat within the first exchange, especially for those three other members of the Bai clan. They clearly understood the strength of this gray-clothed, old woman. She had the strength of a Dou Zong, yet she was unable to even block one punch from Xiao Yan?\n The three of them exchanged glances with one another. The white-clothed lady among them was so shocked that her face had paled.\n Xiao Yan’s figure slowly appeared in front of the ashen-faced, gray-clothed, old woman. His eyes indifferently glanced over her as the corner of his mouth was lifted into an ice-cold arc.\n “Who do you think you are? You dare to utter the word ‘trash’ in front of me?”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1133","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
