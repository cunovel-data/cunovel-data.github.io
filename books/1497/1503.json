He naturally understood just how difficult it was to expel the demonic flame that burned within one’s body. If he didn’t possess five types of Heavenly Flames, he would have ended up suffering serious injuries from the demonic flames earlier. Although Yao Lao was an elite Dou Sheng, he no longer had a Heavenly Flame guarding his body. He would be seriously injured if the demonic flames were allowed to invade his body.\n “Chi!”\n Xiao Yan’s body reflexively moved while his heart was feeling shocked. He appeared beside Yao Lao in a flash. After which, his palm suddenly pounded against Yao Lao’s back. A low cry was also suddenly emitted from his mouth.\n Xiao Yan had mixed a spiritual fluctuation within this cry. The sound wave that was mixed with this fluctuation was transmitted into Yao Lao’s ear. It violently collided with Yao Lao’s soul, causing his face to pale. His tightly shut eyes were also suddenly opened at this moment.\n “Hu hu…”\n Yao Lao, who had opened his eyes, looked at Xiao Yan beside him. He continued to pant through his mouth. A moment later, he finally wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said, “Thus Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is terrifying. It is unexpected that it purposefully creates illusions to stir one’s emotions to attract the flames that will burn oneself. If you had not warned me earlier, I’m afraid that my fate would have not been pleasant.”\n Xiao Yan bitterly laughed. His eyes swept around him as he said, “The fog in this place is a little strange. Let’s leave this area first.”\n “Where is Ancestor Huo Yun and the rest?” Yao Lao frowned and asked in a worried voice. The demonic flame realm was far too mysterious. It was fraught with fatal danger. Even an elite Dou Sheng would face a continuous tribulations upon entering it.\n “I looked for them earlier. There are no signs of them in this area. Xun Er and the rest have also disappeared…” Xiao Yan shook his head and voiced his thoughts. “They are most likely with Xun Er, Zi Yan, and the rest. That group is powerful, and it should not be difficult for them to escape the illusion.”\n “Aye.” Yao Lao nodded. Even if he wanted to save them, there was nothing he could do in this strange place. The only thing that he felt fortunate about was that he did not bring a large group in. Otherwise, all of them would have already perished.\n “Let’s go.”\n Xiao Yan waved his hand. His eyes glanced at those people still sinking into the illusion before they swiftly rushed out of the fog. He did not act out of goodness and rescue every single one of them. Most of the people here were after the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. They could be described as his competitors. Xiao Yan did not wish to see his kindness bring trouble for him in the future.\n Xiao Yan and Yao Lao escaped from the illusion and did not remain in this area. After a couple of minutes of flying, they managed to charge out of the area surrounded by fog.\n Xiao Yan and Yao Lao felt their bodies become a little lighter after they escaped the fog. They turned their heads and looked at the strange cream-white fog. Xiao Yan sighed in relief while feeling some lingering fear within his heart.\n “Xiao Yan ge-ge!”\n A joyous voice was emitted from a short distance away after the two of them hurried out of the fog. Xiao Yan lifted his head and saw a large platform suspended in the air a short distance in front of him. There was a large white door at the end of the platform. At this moment, Xun Er’s group was clustered on the platform. Their eyes were filled with joy as they looked at Xiao Yan and Yao Lao, who had charged out of the fog.\n Xiao Yan slowly landed after seeing Xun Er, Zi Yan, and the others. He exchanged glances with Yao Lao and a flame suddenly surged into his eyes, but the area in front of him did not change.\n “They are not an illusion…”\n Xiao Yan only sighed in relief after seeing that nothing had changed. He smiled asked, “Are you alright?”\n “We’re fine…” Xun Er’s group swiftly hurried forward. She smiled and shook her head before exclaiming, “It is unexpected that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is already able to release the Nightmare Heavenly Fog. It looks like its strength has greatly improved over one thousand years…”\n “Nightmare Heavenly Fog?” Xiao Yan was startled.\n “It is a fog that can cause a person to descend into an illusion forever. This was a unique ultimate skill of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. It is rumored that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint once unleashed this skill and covered an entire city within it. The people in the city felt as though they had lived for a couple of centuries. Only after the fog scattered did they suddenly realize that the hundred year experience was merely a dream.” Gu Nanhai faintly smiled before sighing. “It is rumored that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame wasn’t able to use this skill a thousand years ago. It is unexpected that this time around… it seems like this trip is indeed filled with danger.”\n “Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint…” Xiao Yan recalled the light cluster after hearing this name. The light cluster should have been created by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, but the thing that surprised Xiao Yan was that the light cluster, which reacted to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, had become quiet after entering this realm.\n “Where are the rest?” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept around everyone. He looked around, only to discover that there was no one other than them on this square.\n “This realm is the world of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. We have landed in its hands the moment we entered that crack. Where we will be delivered will depend on its intentions…” Xun Er explained.\n “It has purposefully allowed us to come together. This realm is extremely mysterious. Earlier, I tested what I could do. If I forcefully attempted to break out of this area, even I would suffer a great backlash. This place is like an extremely tough prison. It is impossible to break it!” Gu Nanhai shook his head. His eyes looked at the large tightly shut door and said. “According to what the ancestors in the clan said, the same situation also occurred back then. If we walk through the large door, we will naturally be able to see the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. However, there will be many obstructions behind the large door. We must overcome them if we wish to arrive at the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…”\n “This place has been set up by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. It will likely not be easy to forcefully charge through it.” Xiao Yan frowned and remarked.\n “This is the territory of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Even we can only obey its rules before can find its actual body.” Gu Nanhai faintly laughed. He was about to continue saying something when the surrounding space suddenly fluctuated. A terrifying temperature slowly appeared around them.\n “Be careful!”\n Gu Nanhai frowned and cried out after sensing what was happening.\n Of course, his reminder was unnecessary. At this moment, everyone had already become cautious. Their eyes wearily looked at the many distortions in the space around them. The realm of the demonic flame was far too mysterious. They had to be as cautious as possible.\n “Bang bang!”\n The space around them became more distorted before numerous crack lines appeared. Wave after wave of cream-white flames swept over from the cracks. Soon after, many human figures with a cream-white flame around their bodies came surged out from the many cracks like floodwater. In the blink of an eye, the sky had filled with these fire human figures.\n These human figures were covered in a flame. All of them held a long fire spear in their hands. Their emotionless eyes stared at Xiao Yan’s group.\n Xiao Yan’s eyes were filled with shock as he stared back at the many fire human figures. He was surprised to discover that these people possessed real bodies and their auras were all quite powerful.\n “Be careful, they are all fire slave, experts who have been refined by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. They are another form of a puppet!” Gu Nanhai spoke in a deep voice after seeing these fire human figures appear.\n “Roar!”\n The tens of thousands of fire human figures let out a violent roar after Gu Nanhai’s words sounded. Their bodies moved in unison as they rushed toward Xiao Yan’s group from all directions. Their momentum was truly earth-shaking.\n Xiao Yan frowned upon seeing this human tide rush forward with a ferocious momentum. He reached out with his hand and a terrifying force spread. A hundred fire human figures exploded. Xun Er and the rest also unleashed attacks while Xiao Yan did. Everyone present was an elite Dou Sheng. Their attacks were naturally extremely powerful. Those fire figures were turned into nothing a bunch at a time, but regardless of how ferocious Xiao Yan’s group’s attacks were, there was still an endless number of fire slaves surging out of those cracks. There was no end to this killing!\n “It is pointless to continue this slaughter. We can only head inside!” Gu Nanhai cried out in a deep voice.\n Xiao Yan frowned. He mused for a moment, nodded, and then said, “Let’s go!”\n Xiao Yan’s toes pressed on the ground after his voice sounded. His body rushed forward. The fire slaves blocking his way exploded when they approached within a hundred feet of him. The group began to easily charge through the fire human crowd. All of them threw their own palms that ruthlessly smashed onto the large door.\n “Bang!”\n The large door suddenly cracked apart from the combined attacks of so many experts. The endless fire slaves halted the moment the large door broke, They remained suspended in the sky crowded together.\n “Let’s go. According to the ancestors of the clan, the demonic flame is located at the end of this demonic flame hall!” Gu Nanhai cried out.\n Yao Lao’s group immediately shifted their eyes to Xiao Yan.\n Xiao Yan slightly frowned. He glanced at the endless fire slaves behind him and then looked at the area behind the large door. After a momentary silence, he nodded and said, “Let’s get going!”\n Gu Nanhai also inclined his head after hearing Xiao Yan agree. His body moved, and he took the lead to head through the large door. Xun Er and the rest followed behind him.\n Xiao Yan knit his brows as he looked at the many figures rushing forward. Remaining here would mean facing the endless fire slave army. It seemed that it was only possible to escape this situation by continuing on…\n For some unknown reason, Xiao Yan’s heart vaguely felt an unease. This demonic flame realm was far too mysterious…\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1503","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
