After which, it swiftly pulled back in front of many stunned eyes. Within the blink of an eye, it slid back into the fissure. The sea of fire that had caused Holy Pill City to descend into a panic had disappeared in such a comical fashion. The chaos around the city had also come to a halt at this moment. Numerous stunned eyes stared at the spatial crack in the sky. Of course, more accurately speaking, at the skinny figure standing next to the spatial crack. “That is… Xiao Yan?” “He is still alive? Oh gosh, how is that possible?” “Why is it those flames, that even the great heads from the Pill Tower could not handle, obeyed his words?” After the stunned feeling lasted for a moment, someone finally recognized this star-like figure, who the hot topic of everyone within Holy Pill City half a year ago. In an instant, numerous private conversations rapidly sprung up within the city. Even with Xiao Yan’s calmness, he felt a little weird being stared at by these strange gazes. He raised his head and smiled at the stunned faces of Xuan Kong Zi’s trio in the sky. He asked, “Three association heads, how are you?” “Xiao Yan? You… you are really still alive?” The faces of Xuan Kong Zi’s trio were filled shock and disbelief, especially Xuan Kong Zi’s face. He was someone who had personally entered the Star Region and understood the cruel environment within it extremely well. Even he did not dare to remain for long within it, yet Xiao Yan had been able to remain inside it for eight months without being hurt? Xiao Yan could only shrug his shoulders when he saw the stunned eyes of those three. His hand rubbed over the spatial door and it slowly disappeared. The high temperature that had spread over Holy Pill City also suddenly disappeared. “Your aura…” Xuan Kong Zi’s trio were no ordinary people. They gradually recovered after their initial surprise. Their eyes carefully swept over Xiao Yan and the surprise in them became even richer. The aura of the current Xiao Yan was vastly different compared to when he had entered the Star Region back then… “You… you have subdued the Three Thousand Burning Flame?” Xuan Kong Zi’s eyes flickered. He suddenly seemed to have thought of something as he gently inhaled a breath of cool air and inquired. “Hee hee, Old Xuan isn’t thinking of taking it back, are you?” Xiao Yan laughed and asked. “I am fine if you have resolved that threat…” Xuan Kong Zi could not resist sighing in relief when he saw that Xiao Yan did not deny it. Immediately, he smacked his mouth and said, “However, I did not expect you to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame. The stubbornness of that fellow is something that the three of us witnessed.” Xiao Yan smiled. He was just about to speak when a white figure suddenly rushed over from a short distance away. Before he could recover, it had already rushed to his side. Icy-cool hands grabbed his arm. A pretty and alluring face was currently filled with a joy that could not be hidden. There was a little redness in her pretty eyes. She appeared extremely attractive and would really catch the affection of others. “Relax, I’m fine…” Xiao Yan revealed a warm smile on his face. He softly comforted the Little Fairy Doctor as he looked at her. She was grabbing his hand without speaking while staring at him with a pair of red, pretty eyes. “Hee hee, I have already said that he is definitely fine. My dragon seal will not be wrong.” Zi Yan’s laughing voice was also transmitted from behind the Little Fairy Doctor. However, Xiao Yan could still hear the sigh of relief and joy within her tone. “Old mister Yao, I have caused all of you to worry.” Xiao Yan patted the Little Fairy Doctor’s icy-cool hand, turned his head, and spoke with a smile to Tian Huo zun-zhe, who had followed close behind. Tian Huo zun-zhe smiled and shook his head. His eyes swept over Xiao Yan and shock flashed across them. He could sense that Xiao Yan’s current strength was already at the nine star Dou Zong level. When Xiao Yan had stepped into the Star Region back then, he had been around the level of a four star Dou Zong. Within less than a year, his strength had soared to such an extent… After having followed Xiao Yan for such a long time, Tian Huo zun-zhe was clearly aware of his fighting abilities. When he was at the four star Dou Zong level, he had been able to defeat Tian She, an expert at the peak of the Dou Zong class. Now that he had reached the nine star Dou Zong level, it was likely that no one within the Dou Zong class was a match for him. Even some of the weaker Dou Zuns might not gain an upper hand against him. “Ugh, your training speed… it is really frightening. If this continues, it is likely that it will not be difficult for you to break through to the Dou Zun class.” Tian Huo zun-zhe bitterly laughed in his heart and sighed. After which, he glanced at Little Fairy Doctor and said, “The one who has been most worried about you is her. While you were missing, she constantly thought of entering the Star Region. If the three association heads had not stopped her, she would have forcefully barged in.” Hearing this, Xiao Yan’s eyes looked at the Little Fairy Doctor, who was skinnier compared to before. A complicated emotion surged into his heart at this moment. The most difficult thing to accept in this world was the favor of a beauty. The Little Fairy Doctor had left the Chu Yun Empire with him to head to the Black-Corner Region and had followed him to the Central Plains. She had never uttered any complaints despite traveling such great distances. Although Xiao Yan had helped her resolve her Woeful Poison Body, it was still difficult to make up for this favor of having her follow him all the time. The Little Fairy Doctor appeared to have sensed the change in Xiao Yan’s eyes. This caused her to feel a little panic. She was like a shocked deer as she released her hands and softly said, “Everyone was worried about you. Do not do such dangerous things in the future…” Xiao Yan nodded with a smile. He returned the emotion within his heart as swept his eyes around. When he saw the large lineup of the Pill Tower around him, he involuntarily laughed. After which, he cupped his hands to Xuan Kong Zi’s trio and said, “I’m sorry to have caused the Pill Tower trouble.” “It is fine as long as you are fine. I have suffered much pestering from Xuan Yi during this period of time. Moreover, if something happened to you in our Pill Tower’s territory, Yao Chen would definitely have come and found trouble when he escapes in the future.” Xuan Kong Zi waved his hand and laughed. “Teacher…” The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth was curled when he heard this name. A cold and stern expression flashed across his eyes. He had successfully obtained the Three Thousand Burning Flame. It was time to rescue Teacher from the hands of the Hall of Souls. Seeing Xiao Yan’s somewhat cold and stern face, Xuan Yi appeared to have thought of something. She softly said, “This is not a place to talk. Let’s enter the Pill Tower. We have also obtained some information about where Yao Chen has been imprisoned while you were in the Star Region.” Xiao Yan’s heart suddenly leaped when he heard her words. He quickly suppressed the anxiety in his heart and heavily nodded. “Based on the information that we have obtained, the Hall of Souls thought of transferring Yao Chen when it dispatched people after you back then. However, due to the matters of the Pill Gathering, that transfer ended up being delayed. However, during the half a year you were missing, they have possessed sufficient time to shift Yao Chen from the western region’s Ming City.” Xuan Kong Zi spoke with a grave expression in a meeting room within the Pill Tower. “He has indeed be shifted huh…” Xiao Yan’s expression sank, and his fists were slightly clenched. “In that case, may I know where the Hall of Souls has imprisoned teacher?” Xiao Yan’s eyes were searing hot as they stared at Xuan Kong Zi. The information gathering of the Pill Tower was much better than the four members of his group randomly searching around. With their help, it would definitely be much easier to do things. “There’s some clues, but it has not been verified. We still need some time in order to obtain the exact information.” Xuan Yu slowly said. “However, there is no need for you to be anxious. With our current information, it should be quite soon before we can investigate everything properly.” Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He could only rely on the information he receives from the Pill Tower at this moment. “You need not be overly worried. The Hall of Souls has great use for Yao Chen. Unless they have no other choice, they will not take his life.” Xuan Kong Zi comforted, appearing to be unwilling to let Xiao Yan be overly worried. “Yes, thank you association heads.” “Additionally, if we manage to obtain information, we can only rely on your abilities. Should we lend our hands, we will definitely anger the Hall of Souls and a big battle might erupt. The current Pill Tower is no match for the Hall of Souls. Therefore…” Xuan Kong Zi was quiet for a moment before he softly spoke. “It is already enough that the Pill Tower is helping me find the location where the Hall of Souls has imprisoned teacher. Xiao Yan will feel bad if I get even more help.” Xiao Yan did not feel anything with regards to this point. Xuan Kong Zi’s trio were the great heads of the Pill Tower. Every word and action they made represented the Pill Tower. Moreover, the Hall of Souls was extremely terrifying. If a big battle were to erupt, the implications would be incredible. Hence, even Xuan Kong Zi’s group would not dare to openly declare war with the Hall of Souls unless they had no other choice. “Ugh, you can rest assured. No matter what, the Hall of Souls is an enemy of my Pill Tower. We will do our best to help you.” Xuan Kong Zi replied while feeling a little sorry. Xiao Yan smiled, cupped his hands together, and said, “In that case, I shall thank Old Xuan first.” “You should rest in the Pill Tower during this period of time. You can act immediately once we have obtained information.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He clenched his hand and a jade piece appeared in it. It was something they could transmit information. Feng zun-zhe had given it to him before he had left back then. Now, it was time to summon him over. Once he had gathered everyone and obtained the information he needed, he would charge into the place where Yao Lao was imprisoned and rescue him. “Teacher… relax. Soon… disciple will be able to rescue you.” Xiao Yan raised his head. He inhaled a gentle breath and a dark killing intent flashed across his black eyes. He would definitely return the pain that the Hall of Souls had given Yao Lao a thousand times over! “Crack!” Killing intent surged in Xiao Yan’s heart. He suddenly clenched his hand and the jade piece abruptly shattered.
