{"id":47324,"no":690,"title":"Chapter 690: Discuss","content":"Chapter 690: Discuss “Hee hee, chief Xiao, we did not stir anyone’s attention when we entered the city this time around.” That Old Yin Gu swept his gaze over the hall and smiled as he spoke to Xiao Yan when the three people appeared. “I have troubled the three of you.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He turned his head to Hai Bodong and said, “Old Hai, now, the number of Dou Huangs in my hands is not any lesser than the Misty Cloud Sect. What is there to fear?” Hai Bodong revealed a stunned face as he looked at the three people who had appeared in the hall. Shock gradually swarmed into his heart. He realized that the strength of these three people were all similar to him. That old man with a dark-shadowy face was even a little stronger than him. “You… it is unexpected that you still hid something. How unexpected…” Hai Bodong finally recovered from his shock a moment later. He smacked his lips and praised. Xiao Yan smiled. He held the teacup with his hand and softly said, “As for that Yun Shan… leave him to…” The space in the hall suddenly wiggled before his sentence was completed. Immediately, a tall and a short figure strangely surfaced. That person with a tall figure was wearing a red dress. Her bewitching pretty face was filled with an unusual allure. However, it was cold and icy, causing one to be afraid of looking directly at it. Beside her was a little girl wearing white clothes. Her dark-black gem-like large eyes were rolling all around, curiously observing her surroundings. The two people who had suddenly appeared caused Xiao Yan to be startled. His gaze immediately saw that the little girl’s small hands were holding an exquisite jade box. There was a faint medicinal fragrance that was being emitted from within it. The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth twitched immediately when he saw this scene. His face once again turned green. Clearly, these two people had gone out to steal medicinal ingredients without notifying him again... When Hai Bodong, who was seated in the leader’s seat, saw Xiao Yan’s gradually green face, terror and fear also surged up his own face. That manner was as though he had seen a ghost… “Queen… Queen… Queen Medusa?” Hai Bodong’s body trembled slightly. A moment later, a voice that had a fear in its hoarseness was finally dryly spat out from Hai Bodong’s throat. “Grug!” It was difficult to imagine just what degree of appallment Hai Bodong received when that familiar face once again appeared in front of him. It caused this elite Dou Huang who would not even feel such fear when faced with Yun Shan to quiver when he spoke. He did not expect that after three years, this frightening woman whom he was extremely afraid of was actually still following beside Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan did not discover the fear on Hai Bodong’s face. He stood up with some fury and quickly walked to Medusa’s side. He pulled Zi Yan over and swiftly confiscated the jade box. After which, he lowered his head and spoke in a deep voice to the Zi Yan’s face which had an awkward smile, “You should avoid creating trouble with her in the future. Otherwise, I will immediately send you back!” Zi Yan hurriedly shut her mouth when she heard Xiao Yan’s threat. After which, she hurriedly grabbed the former’s sleeve, indicating that she would definitely stand on Xiao Yan’s side. Medusa by the side was also somewhat helpless when she saw Zi Yan surrendering so quickly by the side. Her pair of bewitching eyes flashed aside for a moment under the focus of Xiao Yan’s eyes which were filled with fury. A moment later, she seemed to explain, ‘This… just now, I saw that the fighting in this place was fiery hot. Therefore, Zi Yan and I went looking around and accidentally obtained a little something.” Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately rolled his eyes fiercely. This thing was actually stolen from the Primer clan? Despite Xiao Yan feeling a fury in his stomach, he could only helplessly shake his head as he looked at Medusa’s face which looked as though the situation was so bad that there would be no difference in making it worse. He turned his head toward Hai Bodong on the leader’s seat and said, “I’m sorry, old Hai. These two troublemaker actually placed their attention on the Primer clan.” Xiao Yan took out that jade box from his storage ring as he spoke. After which, he returned the box. Queen Medusa’s mouth moved a little by the side when she saw this, looking as though she was extremely unwilling to part with it. However, when she saw Xiao Yan ignoring her, she could only helplessly raise her head. A pair of bewitchingly beautiful, long, narrow eyes stared at Hai Bodong in the leader’s seat, who was looking at her with a stunned expression. A dangerous glint flashed through her eyes. Hai Bodong swiftly recovered after meeting Medusa’s eyes. He sensed the somewhat ice-cold dangerous feeling and his body shivered. He hurriedly stood up and spoke to Xiao Yan, “There’s no need to. There’s no need to. We will give it to her since she likes it. In any case, these things are things that our Primer clan wants to auction. Treat it as doing a favor.” Xiao Yan could only give an embarrassed smile when he saw Hai Bodong doing his best to avoid taking it back. After which, he helplessly kept the jade box, turned around and viciously cut Medusa who had quietly sighed in relief before pulling Zi Yan back to his seat. “*Cough*, someone, bring a chair!” Hai Bodong quickly instructed when he saw Medusa was standing in the hall. Xiao Yan might have dared to leave this frightening woman hanging there, but he did not have the courage to do so. Medusa’s icy-cold expression quietly became a little warmer at Hai Bodong’s hospitality. Only then did she feel that this old man, whom she had sealed for many years, was a little pleasing to look at. After settling the seating of Medusa, Old Yin Gu, and the others, Hai Bodong finally turned his gaze toward Xiao Yan and laughed bitterly, “You actually possess such a trump card. With her help, there is indeed no need to fear Yun Shan.” Hearing this, Xiao Yan shook his head and said, “It is very difficult to invite this big deity to move, Hence, you should not place too much hope on her. I will personally handle Yun Shan when we really fight with the Misty Cloud at that time. She… depending on her mood, she might be happy to watch by the side.” Medusa elegantly sat on the chair. Her delicate hand held the teacup as she slowly sipped from it. She appeared to have not heard any of Xiao Yan’s words. Her nonchalant manner caused Hai Bodong to smile bitterly. Just what was the relationship between these two people? From the attitude that Xiao Yan had given her earlier, it seemed that the both of them should have quite a good relationship. Otherwise, who would dare speak to Queen Medusa in that manner given her character. That person would have long been hacked into a couple of pieces. The ferocity and ruthlessness of Medusa was something that Hai Bodong had tasted personally… moreover, the words that Xiao Yan had just spoke possessed a cold mocking feeling to them. This caused Hai Bodong to feel somewhat at a loss. “You will deal with Yun Shan? Isn’t the risk a little too great?” A moment later, Hai Bodong, whose thoughts did not lead to any result, could only give up guessing the relationship between the two as he voiced his opinion. Although Xiao Yan’s strength had currently soared, the chances of him defeating Yun Shan was very low. “Why don’t we do this. We will try our best to make contact with the remaining two large clans, the Alchemist Association, and the imperial family during these few days. If we are able to join hands with them, our chances of victory might increase greatly. After all, Fa Ma in the Alchemist Association and the old demon from the imperial family are all experts of the Dou Huang class. The latter has already advanced to the peak of the class for many years. Moreover, now that I have the ‘Purple Spirit Recovery Pill’ that you have refined for me, I should also be able to recover to my peak after a couple of days. At that time, we should have quite a great chance of success in defeating Yun Shan if the couple of us were to join hands.” Hai Bodong suggested. “Up to you…” Xiao Yan was noncommittal with regards to this suggestion. The old demon of the imperial family and Fa Ma did indeed have some strength. However, the fighting strength that the Nalan clan and the Mu clan could provide were basically negligible. An expert of the Dou Wang class no longer had much use in this kind of battle. Hai Bodong helplessly shook his head when he saw Xiao Yan’s nonchalant manner. He suddenly asked, “What kind of situation do you wish to end up with when you head for the Misty Cloud Sect this time around?” “I will not rest unless one of us dies. I want the Misty Cloud Sect to completely vanish from the Jia Ma Empire.” Xiao Yan raised his eyelids and spoke faintly. “The Misty Cloud Sect’s strength currently covers half of the empire. If you wish to eliminate them from the root, you must remove all of them. By just relying on yourself, you might perhaps be able to kill all of the experts in the Misty Cloud Sect. However, it is very difficult for you to eliminate the remaining members. This is something that the strength of the imperial family will be able to do.” Hai Bodong tried to convince Xiao Yan to put aside his prejudice toward the other factions in the past. Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly when he heard this. The point that Hai Bodong made was indeed true. “Third brother, Old Hai is right. It is far from enough to truly eliminate the Misty Cloud Sect by just relying on just your people. These matters are things that are most appropriate for the imperial family.” Xiao Ding mused for a moment before he finally slowly opened his mouth to speak. Xiao Yan thought for a moment after hearing Xiao Ding open his mouth and did not continue to resist. He waved his hand and said, “Since that is the case, I will trouble Old Hai to help me make contact with them. It is best to settle all of these issues before the fight with the Misty Cloud Sect starts. I have seen quite a bit of backstabbing these few years…” “You little fellow…” Hai Bodong could only helplessly shake his head when he heard Xiao Yan somewhat conspiratorial thoughts. However, it was fortunate that this fellow had agreed to discuss with the other factions. From the faint fear that these factions usually possessed for the Misty Cloud Sect, both parties would likely have a common ground to work together. “There is still one other matter…” “What is it?” Xiao Yan was startled as he asked. “We might have to resolve with one person if we wish to eliminate the Misty Cloud Sect.” Hai Bodong spoke with a solemn expression. “Who?” Xiao Yan frowned slightly as he spoke. “Pill-King Gu He!” Xiao Yan was also stunned when he heard this name. He slowly muttered it under his mouth once as he recalled that person, who was already a top alchemist renowned throughout Jia Ma Empire three years ago. “You should also clearly know just what kind of summoning ability a tier 6 alchemist like Gu He possesses within the empire. If he were to help the Misty Cloud Sect, it is likely that he would at least be able to gather at least five of the ‘Ten Strong’ in the empire. Hence, you should first settle the problem of him before attacking the Misty Cloud Sect.” Hai Bodong spoke solemnly. Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He had nearly forgotten about this important person. Gu He was also a tier 6 alchemist. Xiao Yan clearly know the abilities that an alchemist of this tier possessed. Back then, the experts that Han Feng had gathered from the ‘Black-Corner Region’ had gave even the Inner Academy a headache. Although Gu He’s refining ability might be inferior to Han Feng’s, but he was a true tier 6 alchemist no matter how one put it… “However, how can we settle the issue of him is also a big problem. Gu He is not an ordinary person. Although his relationship with the Misty Cloud Sect is no longer as good as it was in the past during these couple of years, he is ultimately a tribute Elder of the Misty Cloud Sect…” Hai Bodong spoke with a little headache. Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. He tapped his finger gently before suddenly speaking a moment later, “Can Old Hai make contact with Gu He?” Hai Bodong was startled when he heard this. He mused for a moment before speaking slowly, “Gu He is also an Elder in name within the Alchemist Association. Perhaps we can ask Fa Ma to find him.” “Since that is the case, let’s ask Fa Ma to come forward and look for Gu He. It is best that I can meet him. I will think of a way to get him to maintain his neutrality…” Xiao Yan nodded and replied.
