She could sense just how frightening Gu Yao was. Although she was confident in Xiao Yan, she also understood that this Gu Yao was definitely a strong opponent.\n “There are some things that cannot be avoided…” Xiao Yan smiled at her. After which, he turned his head to look at the ice-cold face of Xun Er beside him, who was biting her lower red lip with the back of her teeth. He smiled and said, “It’s fine… even if he did not take the initiative to stir this fight, I would have stepped forward and revealed my strength to the Gu clan. Only then will I he able to block the mouths of some people.”\n Xun Er nodded a little. However, her eyes became colder as she glared at Gu Yao. Xiao Yan had endured much ridicule within the Gu clan during these few days because of her. Today, he was forced to step forward and spar with another. Even with her character, all of this caused her to involuntarily feel a fury within her heart.\n “Hee hee, little fellow is really quite brave. Try to be careful. The old me will intervene to help you if a poor situation occurs…” Mang Tian Chi fondled his beard and laughed, “Since you are a student of my Jian Nan Academy, you are partially a disciple of the old me. I will definitely not watch you die in this Gu Realm.”\n From the looks of Mang Tian Chi’s appearance, it appeared that he was quite pleased that Xiao Yan could receive Gu Yao’s challenge. It was not frightening for one to be weaker. What was frightening was that one did not possess the courage to fight with another. Without this courage, how would one be able to overcome the many obstructions during one’s Dou Qi training?\n “Ha ha, I will thank headmaster then.”\n Xiao Yan smiled. After which, he ceased uttering any unnecessary words. His toes pressed on the ground, and his body rushed into the spacious square in front of a countless number of eyes. After which, he stood across from Gu Yao.\n The icy-cold face of Gu Yao lifted into a vague arc when he looked at Xiao Yan standing a short distance away from him. He said, “Regardless of your strength, your acceptance has already exceeded my expectations.”\n Xiao Yan glanced at this ultimate renowned genius from the Gu clan. His glaring black-white hair caused him to appear somewhat strange for no reason. His body continued to release an icy aura that was like ten-thousand-year-old mysterious ice. This person appeared to have been cast from cold ice. A cold aura was emitted from deep within one’s heart by just looking at him.\n “You should be aware of the reason I have targeted you…”\n Xiao Yan’s brows twitched. He looked at Gu Yao and slowly replied, “I am aware. However, it is useless!”\n Gu Yao nodded. He was not surprised by this reply as he softly said, “In that case, I can… only kill you…”\n The entire place suddenly turned icy-cold after Gu Yao’s last word sounded. His black and white hair suddenly began to dance. Gu Yao’s body also disappeared like a ghost in an instant.\n Xiao Yan’s face was completely replaced by a solemness the moment Gu Yao disappeared. His opponent this time around was even stronger than the ninth Tianzun of the Hall of Souls. If he underestimated his opponent even a little, he would end up with a miserable ending. Xiao Yan’s heart was clearly aware that no one within the Gu clan who would support Xun Er and him if he was defeated by Gu Yao today. Hence, he could not lose this fight!\n “I have walked from the Jia Ma Empire. During these ten years, I have roamed the continent and met a countless number of enemies. I have lingered at death’s gate a countless number of times. The effort I have put in is many times greater than a genius like you. I do not care about the Dou Di bloodline. However, you have to be prepared to pay a bloody price if you wish to kill me!”\n Xiao Yan suddenly clenched his hand. The Dou Qi within his body surged out without holding back. The bones all over his body emitted a wave of crackling sounds as the Dou Qi surged. His vast and mighty Dou Qi was accompanied by a hot wind, causing the icy-cold temperature in the sky to swiftly rise. At the same time, a cold cry that was filled with an endless perseverance erupted from Xiao Yan’s mouth.\n The roaming of these years had caused Xiao Yan’s character to remain as calm as a rock. He would be able to adjust to the most perfect state regardless of what challenge he faced. This was a talent that the many years of roaming had blessed him with!\n “Bang!”\n A vast and might Dou Qi swiftly agglomerated in Xiao Yan’s right fist as his cry sounded. After which, his hand shook strangely. An unusually powerful force suddenly smashed toward the space in front of him without any fancy maneuvers.\n His right hand violently punched toward the empty space. Just when it was about to strike, a long hand was suddenly extended from the empty space. After which, it was accompanied by a sharp blade force that slammed into Xiao Yan’s right fist in a lightning-like fashion.\n A frightening energy ripple immediately surged when the two made contact. Numerous crack lines swiftly spread from point of contact. Powerful forces swept apart and shattered some stone fragments in the square to dust.\n The eyes of those three Gu clan elders present flickered when they saw such an intense exchange. Their bodies moved, and they rushed high into the sky. Their hands formed some seals before using their Dou Qi to isolate this square.\n “Hmph!”\n A muffled snort was emitted from Xiao Yan’s mouth as he stood in the square. His toes pressed on the ground and his body swiftly pulled back. He glanced at his right fist. At this moment, five claw scars had appeared on it. Fresh blood was seeping out of it, dying his hand a bloody mess in the blink of an eye.\n Clearly, Xiao Yan had suffered a small loss during this exchange. With his five star Dou Zun strength, he was unable to reach to contend with the eight star Gu Yao head-on.\n “Open Mountain Seal!”\n Gu Yao coldly laughed. The seal formed by his hands changed and a fierce handprint erupted toward Xiao Yan.\n The silver glow under Xiao Yan’s feet flickered when faced with Gu Yao’s sharp attack. His body avoided the attack.\n “Open Mountain Seal, Sea Flipping Seal!”\n Gu Yao’s cold laugh became even more intense after his palm missed. The seal on his hand danced, forming many after-images. Numerous powerful hand seals continued to fly out and smashed toward Xiao Yan from all directions. The God Seal Skill had been practiced by Gu Yao until it reached a peak. Adding his incomparably powerful Dou Qi, he was able to use it with ease. He did not experience the slightest difficulty.\n “Skyfire Three Mysterious Change! First Change! Second Change! Third Change!”\n Xiao Yan’s expression became grave as he faced the energy palm imprint that rushed over from all directions. The Skyfire Three Mysterious Change was unleashed to its limits with just a thought. The Dou Qi within his body soared at this moment!\n “Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler!”\n Xiao Yan clenched his hand. The dark-black Heavy Xuan Ruler flashed and appeared. Dense ruler images appeared one after another. Within a short instant, the area a hundred feet around Xiao Yan had been filled by ruler images.\n “Bang bang bang!”\n The many energy palm imprints violently struck the heavy ruler’s defenses It appeared to have triggered a continuous chain of explosions. Powerful energy ripples spread apart like floodwater. They shook the square until it began tremble.\n Everyone around the stadium was watching the extremely intense battle that had erupted in an instant. An excitement vaguely rose within their eyes. Many people wanted to know just what kind of ending would face Xiao Yan, who was considered the top among the younger generation within the Central Plains, since he had met this genius from the Gu clan.\n “Bang!”\n Unusually loud explosions resounded within the battleground. A figure flew back through the air. After which, he staggered back two steps before landing on the ground.\n “Flame Splitting Tsunami!”\n Xiao Yan stabilized his body. His expression still remained solemn. The heavy ruler in his hand was suddenly hacked down. A thousand-foot-large fire pillar suddenly shot from the tip of the ruler. Finally, it rushed toward Gu Yao in the distance in a lightning-like fashion.\n “A petty skill. What use is a Dou Skill of such strength?”\n Gu Yao merely laughed when faced with the fire pillar’s great momentum. He clenched his hand and a dense white ice erupted from his body. His hand was completely covered by the mysterious ice a moment later.\n “Shatter!”\n His mysterious ice hand suddenly struck forward. It violently smashed into the fire pillar in front of many eyes. The powerful force shattered it..\n “This is yours…”\n Gu Yao had just cried out coldly after having shattered the fire pillar with a punch when his eyes suddenly became cold. He saw a rapidly rotating three-colored fire lotus within the fire glow. This lotus continued to shoot toward him. He could sense a slight aura of destruction within it.\n “Explode!”\n Xiao Yan’s face was ice-cold. His hand seal changed and a sharp cry sounded. That three-colored fire lotus swelled with a speed that could not be clearly seen by the naked eye. An instant later, a frightening fire storm swept across the the sky!\n “Bang!”\n A thousand-foot-large explosion instantly appeared in the square in front of the many eyes when the fire storm swept apart. Even the Dou Qi barrier surrounding the square was shaken until it fluctuated.\n “What a powerful Dou Skill… this little fellow is really cunning. He actually hid such a powerful thing under the fire glow, causing Gu Yao to underestimate it. He managed to catch him off-guard.”\n Quite a number of experts nodded quietly as they watched the fire storm spreading over the square. The battle experience that had been honed through fighting a countless number of experts had indeed given Xiao Yan a chance…\n Xiao Yan watched the fire storm spread in the square. The seriousness on his face was not reduced. A three-colored fire lotus might be strong, but if Gu Yao could be finished off this easily, he wouldn’t be qualified to be one of the four great generals of the Gu clan.\n “Bang!”\n This thought had just appeared in Xiao Yan’s heart when the fire storm suddenly trembled. A wave of extremely cold aura slowly spread. At the same time, a monstrous Dou Qi surged in all directions like the ocean. They roared over in a turbulent fashion.\n “You have experienced many difficulties, but so what? I possess the bloodline of a Dou Di and practice the true teachings of the Gu clan. My level far surpasses you. Just what qualification do you, as a descendant of the declined Xiao clan, have to fight me?”\n A bone-chilling cry suddenly exploded while the monstrous Dou Qi was roaring across the sky. This caused Xiao Yan’s expression to slowly turn gloomy.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1332","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
