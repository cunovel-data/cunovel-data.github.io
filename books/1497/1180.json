A densely packed sea of people covered the ground as far as one could see. An earth-shaking, boiling noise resounded across the sky like the roar of a large dragon. Under this terrifying sonic wave, even the cloud layer in the sky had been destroyed until only pieces were left…\\n\\n Many stone platforms floated in the air above the square. These stone platforms were the most dazzling because the final face-off of this Pill Gathering would occur on them.\\n\\n After the somewhat low spirits of the last few days, the liveness of the square had undoubtedly reached a peak because today was the day the the Pill Realm was opening. Only those alchemists who had successfully walked out of the Pill Realm would possess the qualification to continue participating in the Pill Gathering!\\n\\n The atmosphere of the open ground was fiery hot. A countless number of gazes were focused on the middle of the square. There was an enormous door that was constructed using black rocks at that spot. The spatial ripple at the large door had revealed a distorted feeling. This was the exit of the Pill Realm. Soon after, the competitors who had successfully passed the second hurdle would be walking out of there…\\n\\n The Little Fairy Doctor’s group’s eyes were focused on the large spatial door on the tall stage of the stadium. Their faces contained a slight anxiety. Although they were confident in Xiao Yan’s abilities, they were also aware of the intensity of the competition in the Pill Realm…\\n\\n “Ke ke, there is no need to worry. Many competitors have shattered their spatial stones and come out during this period of time. If Xiao Yan had come out, he would definitely have come looking for us.” Ye Zong by the side smiled when he saw their eyes, so he spoke in a comforting manner. Immediately, he felt that these words were not really appropriate. He dryly laughed and said, “Moreover, with Xiao Yan’s intelligence, passing the second hurdle should not be much of a problem.”\\n\\n The Little Fairy Doctor could only helplessly shake her head in the face of Ye Zhong’s comfort. She was just about to speak when her pretty eyes suddenly swept to the square. The spatial door at the spot had suddenly emitted waves of intense spatial ripples.\\n\\n “The large spatial door has been opened!”\\n\\n The sea of people that stretched endlessly immediately emitted a soul-stirring cheer when the spatial ripple appeared. Immediately, a countless number of heated eyes swung around. After which, they paused on the large spatial door.\\n\\n All the eyes present looked down as the fluctuation from the spatial door became more intense. In the end, numerous figures began to slowly walk out. Their legs landed on the ground of the square amid the cheers of everyone present.\\n\\n A deafening cheer erupted from the viewing gallery when they watched these competitors successfully come out. Those who could arrive at this place were already considered among the top alchemists across the entire continent. Even if they were to give up participating in the competition now, they would still be treated as VIPs by some factions.\\n\\n The cheers grew louder as more and more human figures walked out of the spatial door one after another. The large square trembled under this terrifying sound.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n The spatial door rippled once again. Immediately, an extremely eye-catching, graceful figure slowly walked out. Finally, the figure was exposed under the warm sunlight. Immediately, the cheers in the arena reached a high tide. The name Cao Ying was quite renowned. Everyone knew that she had the ability to compete for the champion spot this time around.\\n\\n Compared to Cao Ying, the limelight that Song Qing enjoyed was clearly dimmer. Even though he was also considered a genius, he ultimately had difficulty competing with the limelight of demonic talent.\\n\\n A large group of people walked out after Cao Ying. However, the Little Fairy Doctor’s group was unable to find Xiao Yan’s figure no matter how they searched. Her pretty face immediately changed a little and her hands involuntarily tightened. If any accident were to occur to Xiao Yan within the Pill Realm, it was difficult to imagine just what kind of madness she would descend into…\\n\\n Ye Zhong by the side did not dare to say anything as he looked at the Little Fairy Doctor’s darkening face. His heart was beginning to feel uncertain. The greatest enemy within the Pill Realm was not the Magical Beasts within it but the other competitors. In order to enable oneself to gain an additional chance to succeed, some strong people would likely kill the competitors who could threaten them…\\n\\n Other places were filled with joyful, earth-shaking cheers, but this small area appeared exceptionally quiet. At this moment, even Tian Huo zun-zhe had involuntarily knit his eyebrows. His finger, which had originally been placed together, had parted without him realizing it.\\n\\n The spatial large door once again rippled when the hearts of the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest had sunk. A skinny figure slowly appeared. Finally, he stepped out of the large spatial door and landed on the ground.\\n\\n “It’s big brother Xiao Yan!”\\n\\n Xin Lan hurriedly cried out. A joy quickly surfaced on her face when she saw this skinny figure.\\n\\n The hearts of the Little Fairy Doctor’s group shook when they heard her voice. Their eyes swiftly looked over and did indeed see an unusually familiar figure. Immediately, the few of them sighed in relief.\\n\\n “Ke ke, I have already said that it is impossible for Xiao Yan to not be able to pass this second hurdle with his strength…” The heavy burden in Ye Zhong’s heart was lifted at this moment as he laughed.\\n\\n Xiao Yan, who was walking out of the large spatial door, suddenly turned his eyes over while everything was sighing in relief. He immediately smiled and nodded to the group.\\n\\n “This fellow…”\\n\\n The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily shook her head and spoke in a soft, helpless manner when she saw Xiao Yan’s energetic appearance.\\n\\n Xiao Yan was involuntarily a little absent-minded as he heard the surrounding loud voices from the middle of the square. The time he had spent within the Pill Realm had indeed been quiet, but it had seemed to be lacking something. Only now that he had left did he realize that the Pill Realm lacked people.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes swept in all directions as he stood on the square. He looked at the spatial large door that was still continuously spitting out people. His eyes involuntarily became a little surprised. The numbers on this square reached at least a thousand. He did not expect so many people to last after those two elimination rounds. An alchemist gathering involving such numbers was something that even the Jia Ma Empire Alchemist Grand Meeting back then was far from being able to compare with. Of course, this was not only in terms of numbers. There was also a difference in quality. Any random person in this place would easily be able to be the champion of that Alchemist Grand Meeting…\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s sweeping eyes suddenly paused on the highest seats in the square a moment later. That spot contained a vast, mighty aura that caused even Xiao Yan to feel some pressure.\\n\\n “The three giant heads of the Pill Tower huh…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over those three figures. He was a little startled because he discovered the pretty woman in cheongsam, whom he had never met before, carefully studying him.\\n\\n Although Xiao Yan had never met this pretty woman, he was aware of her status just from the place she was standing. His heart was slightly shocked. An existence of this level was not someone the current him could offend. Hence, he did not dare to pause his eyes for too long. All he did was glance over before quickly shifting his eyes away…\\n\\n “Is he Xiao Yan? Yao Chen’s disciple?”\\n\\n The pretty woman stared at Xiao Yan from the tall platform, which had everyone’s attention, before she suddenly inquired.\\n\\n “Ha ha, yup, he’s Xiao Yan…” Xuan Kong Zi by the side smiled and nodded. His eyes swept over Xiao Yan and his expression suddenly changed. A surprised gasp was emitted from his mouth.\\n\\n “Have you discovered it? The spiritual ripple of this little fellow seems to be a little unusual. If I have guessed correctly, he should have already touched the Soul State…” The pretty woman slightly smiled and softly spoke.\\n\\n “It does have some appearance of the Soul State…” The dark-skinned elder by her side also nodded in a somewhat stern manner. Surprise flashed across his face as he said, “The eyesight of this old fellow Yao Chen is really good. How envious…”\\n\\n “If he has really advanced to the soul state, even Cao Ying and Dan Chen would have some difficulty defeating him in this Pill Gathering…” The pretty woman laughed.\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi nodded. Xiao Yan had not given him such a feeling when he had last met him. Clearly, this kind of transformation should be related to this trip to the Pill Realm.\\n\\n “Ugh. Can it really be so tough to beat that old fellow once…”\\n\\n The spatial door in the square continued to ripple for nearly half an hour before it finally slowed. The distorted space ripple slowly disappeared. The spatial large door once again recovered its calmness.\\n\\n The number of competitors in the square had increased significantly by the time the spatial door was shut. This caused Xiao Yan’s heart to be slightly startled. These people seemed to be outstanding alchemist who had come from all over the Dou Qi continent. One would have to step over the heads of all these people in order to become the Pill Gathering champion. That person would have to climb up step-by-step until they reached the peak!\\n\\n The originally noisy square had become much quieter the moment the large spatial door was shut. Everyone knew that what occurred next would be the main event of this Pill Gathering!\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi’s eyes swept over the square from the tall stage. His gentle cough resounded by the side of everyone’s ears, causing everyone’s eyes to gather on him.\\n\\n “First of all, congratulations to all of you who are able to stand here. You have all passed the second round of eliminations… however, you should all be aware that this next round is the most important event of the Pill Gathering. The one who can stand until the end will become the champion this time around!\\n\\n “The stone platforms in the sky are the stages for you to perform. Hopefully, you will be able to unleash the brightest moment in your life at that spot!\\n\\n “Glory will be born amid all of you!”\\n\\n This short speech was just like the spark that lit the explosives. Suddenly, the open ground boiled!\\n\\n The grandest meeting within the alchemist world had finally arrived at this moment!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1180","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
