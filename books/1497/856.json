Even the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan were among the people already there.\n Su Qian quietly sat in the hall. He involuntarily smiled when he saw Xiao Yan and Xiao Li entering. A female servant with sharp eyes and quick hands respectfully placed two empty chairs in the leader’s position.\n Xiao Yan and Xiao Li slowly walked into the hall and unceremoniously sat in those chairs. Only then did they smile. One asked Su Qian, “First Elder, is there news of Old Ying Shan?”\n Su Qian nodded slightly and slowly replied, “According to the information that was received earlier, it seemed that Old Ying Shan has already left the city. However, there is something strange. This old fellow did not do anything to hide his trace. Instead, he walked out of the eastern gate where the greatest number of people are. Currently, it is likely that quite a number of factions within the Black Emperor City have already received this information.”\n Xiao Yan involuntarily frowned when he heard this. What was this Old Ying Shan planning to do? He was actually acting with such a high profile in the face of such a situation where everyone was looking at him with ill intent. Even though he was an elite Dou Zong, it was likely that it would be troublesome dealing with those many greedy people who would come in a wave-like manner.\n “Don’t tell me that it is a bait and not his true self?” Xiao Li frowned and questioned.\n “There was no lack of experts among those people observing. However, if they could see Old Ying Shan’s figure from far away, they would feel shocked. If it is a subsitute, it is impossible for Old Ying Shan to go and find another elite Dou Zong, right? If that is the case, he would be able to ignore everything and just leave. With two Dou Zongs, there would hardly be anyone in the ‘Black-Corner Region’ who would dare stop them.” Su Qian shook his head and explained.\n “Don’t tell me that he really intends to deal with the many ‘Black-Corner Region’ factions and experts who are watching him with malicious intent?” Xiao Yan tightly knit his brows as he wondered out loud.\n “Given this old fellow’s rampant, fierce, brutal character back then, we cannot eliminate this thinking.” Su Qian hesitated for a moment before repling to Xiao Yan’s random words.\n Xiao Yan involuntarily rolled his eyes when he heard this. If this was really the case, would he not appear a little too arrogant? Given his eyesight, Old Ying Shan would naturally be aware that he was not the only elite Dou Zong in the auction ground who had an interest in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. If it was just ordinary people, he could rely on his strength and view them without any fear. However, it would be impossible for him to ignore these experts who were of the same class as him, right?\n “Has that Demon Flame Valley had any activity?” Xiao Yan’s finger gently tapped the table before he suddenly asked.\n “They are also aware of the news of Old Ying Shan leaving the city. Currently, they are following a short distance behind him. From the looks of it, they don’t appear on to be planning an immediate attack.” Su Qian replied.\n Xiao Yan faintly nodded. He mused for a moment before slowly standing up. He said in a deep voice, “In that case, we should also move. It is of no help to make random guesses in this place. Instead, we should follow behind Old Ying Shan and see just what he is planning to do. From how I see it, he would definitely not hand something as precious as the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to someone else to take away given his cautious character. After all, he is quite confident in his strength.”\n “Yes, I know.”\n No one rejected Xiao Yan’s suggestion. Immediately, the people from ‘Xiao Gate’ and Jia Nan Academy began to pack everything under Xiao Li’s and First Elder Su Qian’s orders. After which, they quietly left this compound from the back. They swiftly exited the Black Emperor City and followed the path which Old Ying Shan had taken, attempting to catch up with him.\n Not long after Xiao Yan’s group left the Black Emperor City, news of their departure was swiftly transmitted to the Black Emperor Sect.\n Mo Tian Xing’s expression was indifferent as he listened to the report of the spy within the Black Emperor Sect’s Meeting Room. A moment later, he nodded and waved his hand to dismiss the spy.\n “It is unexpected that this Yan Xiao has actually gotten together with ‘Xiao Gate’s’ group… this is somewhat troublesome. Won’t their side have two elite Dou Zong?” Qi Shan watched the spy withdraw from behind Mo Tian Xing. He frowned and asked a question.\n “If Yan Xiao and them are not old acquaintances, it might be likely that the people from ‘Xiao Gate’ gave him the ruler technique Dou Technique. The one they had bought in the auction. It would facilitate cooperation between both parties…” Mo Tian Xing slightly nodded. His expression was somewhat ugly. Originally, he had thought that Xiao Yan and ‘Xiao Gate’ had formed a grudge after the matters at the auction. It was unexpected that they ended up working together…\n “What should we do now? Currently, their strength is even greater after joining hands. We can forget about obtaining that Zong Breaking Pill.” Mo Ya by his side could not help but anxiously speak after hearing this. The Zong Breaking Pill was something that even Qi Shan could not refine. If he could not obtain the pill in Xiao Yan’s hands, he would not know just when it would be before he gained the chance to obtain another.”\n “What are you so anxious for? Currently, they are working together. Don’t tell me that you can go over and break them apart? Two Dou Zongs. Even I would not dare to act. Now, you will quietly wait here. They are clearly targeting Old Ying Shan. However, this old fellow is also not an ordinary person. It will not be an easy matter to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from him.” Mo Tian Xing’s expression sank as he reprimanded.\n Mo Ya could only swallow the resentment he felt after being reprimanded by Mo Tian Xing. He felt bitter, but did not dare to speak.\n “Sect leader, there seems to be something wrong with Old Ying Shan. Given his cautious character, it is impossible for him to leave the city in such a flagrant manner. He should also know that there are many experts waiting for him outside of the city.” Qi Shan frowned as he hesitatingly spoke.\n “This old fellow is also cautious and crafty. It is naturally impossible for him to do such a thing.” Mo Tian Xing’s face revealed a strange smile as he softly replied.\n Qi Shan and Mo Ya by the side involuntarily exchanged covert gazes with one another when they saw that strange smile on Mo Tian Xing’s face. However, while they wanted to wait for Mo Tian Xing to continue speaking, the latter shut his mouth. Qi Shan could not help but carefully asked, “Does sect leader know what that old fellow is planning?”\n “You will naturally know when the time come. This Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is not something that our Black Emperor Sect is willing to simply take out…” Mo Tian Xing waved his hand. His eyes revealed a denseness as he coldly laughed, “Now, we will just watch these factions get entangled in a bloody battle with Old Ying Shan. The more people die the better.”\n Qi Shan and Mo Ya looked at each other after hearing this. They immediately laughed and agreed.\n “Ugh, if our Black Emperor Sect had not failed to obtain even a little information about the Bodhisattva Heart from this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva despite studying it for such a long time, we would definitely not have taken this thing out to auction.” Mo Tian Xing knit his brows as his eyes swept to a distant area outside of the Black Emperor City.\n “However, regardless of whether we are able to study and find something, it is always best if the thing is in our hands… other people can forget about obtaining the thing that our Black Emperor Sect fails to obtain!”\n Xiao Yan’s group looked down at the main road within the woods from a small hill. A gray-haired old man at one side of the road appeared as though he did not sense the strange atmosphere as he slowly walked as he pleased. Human figures were leaping and rushing from behind him as numerous fiery hot gazes penetrated the cover of the forest. They stared intently at the back of the old man in front.\n Although the greed in their hearts was burning their rational thoughts, no one dares to make the slightest unusual movement in front of the frightening strength of Old Ying Shan. They merely continued to follow. However, this state of tracking would instantly be broken with the increase in one’s greed. The allure of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was too difficult for everyone to resist.\n “This old fellow is actually not the least bit anxious? By traveling at such a tepid pace, is he not trying to cause more and more people to be attracted over?” Xiao Yan stared at the old back in the forest from the hill as he frowned and questioned.\n Xiao Li and Su Qian knit their brows as they stood by Xiao Yan’s side. The actions of Old Ying Shan caused them to feel quite uncertain. Based on common sense, anyone who had obtained such a rare treasure would naturally use the fastest speed to leave this dangerous place. In the end, this old fellow… Displayed this strange scene? Did he really intend to rely on his own strength to contend with the many experts from the ‘Black-Corner Region’?\n “The number of auras that have appeared in this forest are increasing. There are quite a number of people among them who are quite skilled. Should someone end up taking the lead to attack, it would likely end up affecting the entire situation, sparking this chaotic situation. At that time, Old Ying Shan would have some trouble.” Su Qian slowly spoke.\n Xiao Yan vaguely nodded. His gaze swept over the forest and suddenly asked, “Where are the people from the Demon Flame Valley?”\n “They should also be keeping their eyes on Old Ying Shan. However, quite a number of powerful experts have been sent from the Demon Flame Valley this time around. It is extremely difficult to discover them if they hid in this mountain forest.” Su Qian whispered.\n Xiao Yan inclined his chin. His gaze swept over the road in the forest. Finally, he stared intently at Old Ying Shan’s back. For some unknown reason, he felt a persistent feeling that something was not quite right. Everyone kept saying that this old fellow was crafty. Yet, he was currently moving in this manner. This did not match his description…\n A commotion suddenly occurred within the crowd that was following behind Old Ying Shan while this thought flashed through Xiao Yan’s heart.\n Xiao Yan slid his eyes over when he sensed the commotion. His eyes immediately solidified as he softly asked, “Are they about to strike?”\n The mountain forest that was covered by a layer of strange atmosphere suddenly froze. The source of this solidification was ten shadowy-faced human figures among the large group of people following behind.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-856","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
