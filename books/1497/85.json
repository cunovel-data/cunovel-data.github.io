{"id":46719,"no":85,"title":"Chapter 85: Acceptance","content":"Chapter 85: Acceptance\n Facing dozens of four star Dou Zhe level practitioners wielding steel rods, the squad of over ten people that had been flaunting their power suddenly froze. Before they had the chance to escape, those black metal rods ruthlessly rained down on every part of their bodies. In an instant, horrible shrills echoed through the entire street.\n After throwing a cold glance at the ashen faced Jia Lie Ao, Xiao Yan tilted his head and faced the furious, red-faced Xiao Yu and asked in a gentle voice: \"Are you alright? You should have informed me that you were coming over. Recently, this bunch of bastards from the Jia Lie Clan have been looking to stir up some trouble.”\n Being suddenly treated so gently by Xiao Yan for the first time, Xiao Yu was obviously shocked. The redness on her face grew a shade darker. At a loss, she randomly shifted her gaze and spoke: “I met Xun Er when I left the house. She said that she wanted to come and see you so I decided to accompany her. How was I supposed to know that I would encounter these bastards?”\n Xiao Yan couldn’t help but shake his head. He shifted his gaze to the young lady clad in green, whose face was full of joy at his appearance. The smile on his face became even gentler: \"You seemed to enjoy cursing just now.”\n Listening to Xiao Yan making fun of her, Xun Er innocently shook her head, pursing her lips and saying with a bright smile: \"That wasn\u0027t my intention. It was just that I didn\u0027t like his attitude - Even Xiao Yan ge-ge back then didn\u0027t dare to openly snatch someone off the street.\"\n Facing Xun Er’s hidden rebuttal, Xiao Yan touched his nose and smiled forcefully. He might have been a little arrogant back then, but he could not be as bad as the man in front of him.\n “Oh, isn’t this the young master of the Xiao Clan? Having not seen you for over a year, I heard that you have finally gotten rid your name, ‘cripple’!” Jia Lie Ao couldn’t help but butt in after seeing Xiao Yan speak to Xun Er.\n “Who is he?” Liu Xi‘s gaze was equally cold. Seeing Xun Er chatting and laughing with another man after giving him the cold shoulder was a great blow to the arrogant Liu Xi’s ego. he could not accept this.\n “Hehe, Liu Xi Da-ge, this is the Xiao clan’s famous “genius”. His name is Xiao Yan. Back then, despite training for over ten years, his Dou Qi remained at only the third or fourth stage. I don’t know what he ate recently, but his Dou Qi rose quickly to the eighth stage within a few months.” Jia Lie Ao stood beside Lu Xi and made the introduction with a cold smile.\n “Regardless of how great one’s talent is, if one isn’t even a Dou Zhe, he is nothing but trash,” Said Liu Xi coldly\n Hearing these words, Xun Er’s small face grew even icier. A golden flame flashed in her limpid eyes.\n Reaching out his hand and lightly patting on Xun Er’s stretched, taut body, Xiao Yan smiled indifferently and shook his head. Turning his head, Xiao Yan glanced at Liu Xi who was completely dressed in white. His gaze randomly swept towards his chest where the Alchemist badge resided and smiled: \"You should be the alchemist who refined the potion ‘Return of Spring Powder’, right?”\n Lu Xi coldly smiled and stuck out his chest with the badge, proudly announcing: \"That’s right! I am the alchemist hired by the Jia Lie Clan.”\n Xiao Yan, seemingly having realised something, nodded and laughed, “No wonder. Only an alchemist like you could refine such a low-grade healing medicine. You really have been worthy of your master’s teaching!”\n Upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words, the surrounding mercenaries promptly laughed loudly. After having experienced the profiteering ways of the Jia Lie Clan, these mercenaries held a significant grudge against the creator of the “Return of Spring Powder”. Seeing that Xiao Yan dared mock the creator in his face, they felt a little satisfied.\n The laughter of those around him resulted in Liu Xi’s face gradually growing darker. His eyes coldly stared at Xiao Yan: “You are helping your Xiao Clan offend someone they cannot afford to offend.”\n Hearing this, Xiao Yan was a little stunned. He laughed bitterly and massaged his head, utterly speechless at how arrogant the man was. Did he really think he was some disciple of a Dou Di? A one star alchemist would be respected by the Xiao Clan but to say that he was someone the clan couldn’t afford to offend, that would be a joke.\n TL: Dou Di is the highest Dou Rank\n “Ai, how did he become an alchemist with such low intelligence?” Sighing and shaking his head, Xiao Yan, who was a little depressed, exchanged a glance with Xun Er. After having a brief conversation with Liu Xi, he finally understood why the gentle and soft Xun Er would dislike this man so much.\n Rubbing his palm gently on his face, Xiao Yan was too lazy to continue conversing with this obviously stupid person. Waving his hand at the dozen of large men behind him, he smiled, “Attack! Go after their master too. Since these people dared to create trouble in our territory, we do not need to give them any face. Otherwise, we may be laughed at.”\n Seeing Xiao Yan’s actions, Jia Lie Ao’s faced changed. He did not expect Xiao Yan would really attack. Turning his eyes, he insultingly provoked: \"I thought that you had grown quite a bit. To think that you are still a useless person who only knows how to rely on his subordinates.”\n “Your provocations really are rather weak.” Xiao Yan waved the metal rod in his hand as he spoke quietly.\n “If you wish to treat it as a provocation, then consider it one. A useless person like you doesn’t have the qualification to walk beside Xun Er Xiao-jie.” Said Jia Lie Ao insultingly. A cold look stealthily flashed across his eyes as he continued with his evil design: “You should have undergone the Coming of Age Ceremony, haven’t you? Heh. That means if I challenge you now, you won’t have any reason to decline, right?”\n “You are really shameless. Xiao Yan is only seventeen this year while you are twenty-three. You actually dare to issue such a challenge. If you wish to play, I am willing to accompany you!” Xiao Yu rebuked Jia Lie Ao challenge. Her eyebrows straightened and she lashed out with her whip, leaving a thin white scar on the ground.\n The corner of his mouth twitched slightly as Jia Lie Ao provokingly said: “You seem to have quite good luck with women.Yet another woman has come forward to stand up for you. Heh, you are but a coward who only knows how to hide behind women.”\n “Dammit, this white face is too cocky. Young Master, I will play with him in your place: \" Watching the overbearing Jia Lie Ao, some of the surrounding mercenaries who had a better relationship with Xiao Yan howled.\n Seeing that his words had stirred up such a large commotion, Jia Lie Ao’s face changed. His strength was that of a three star Dou Zhe and was a little overwhelmed at offending such a large crowd.\n Glancing at the expressionless Xiao Yan, Jia Lie Ao brushed his sleeves and coldly said: “Since you don’t have the guts to accept the challenge, then let’s forget about it. Liu Xin Da-ge, let’s go. A person who did not dare to accept such a challenge doesn’t deserve any respect.”\n Liu Xi nodded his head while wearing a shady smile. His gaze covertly landed on Xun Er for a moment before furiously glaring at Xiao Yan and threatening: “Brat, just you wait. I will have the Xiao Clan voluntarily send her over to me. Amongst all the woman who had caught my eye, there was not a single one whom I cannot get my hands on.”\n Xun Er indifferently glared at Liu Xi, whose face was filled with obscenity. Within her eyes, a killing intent finally emerged.\n Jia Lie Ao and Lu Xi turned around but a couple of haughty large men from the Xiao Clan appeared at the entrance of the marketplace and barricaded the entrance.\n “I know that you really wish to cripple me. Em, alright. Let’s fulfill your wish… I accept your challenge.” Just as Jia Lie Ao was about to send a signal for help, a young man’s indifferent voice suddenly rang out from behind him.\n Hearing this, Jia Lie Ao was first stunned before a sinister smile appeared. The corner of his mouth slowly lifted as he whispered: “It’s you who seeks death. Don’t blame me if anything happens.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-85","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
