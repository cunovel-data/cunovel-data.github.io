{"id":47240,"no":606,"title":"Chapter 606: Revealing The True Form","content":"Chapter 606: Revealing The True Form The ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ went against everyone’s expectations and did not continue to give chase after defeating Han Feng in the sky. Instead, it abruptly turned its enormous head and focused its snake eyes on the distant Xiao Yan. The ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ within Xiao Yan’s body appeared to have become cautious the instant the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ locked onto Xiao Yan. It suddenly automatically erupted from within Xiao Yan’s body. In the blink of an eye, it firmly wrapped around Xiao Yan’s entire body. “Hiss!” The invisible fire python raised it head to the sky and emitted a sharp hissing sound. It violently swung its enormous tail, and its enormous body carried a hot wind of great pressure as it hurriedly shot toward Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan’s expression changed slightly as he watched the invisible fire python that did not hesitate in changing its target. The green fire wings on Xiao Yan’s back flapped hurriedly as a silver glow surfaced from under his feet. Immediately, the faint rolling sound of thunder resonated in the sky as his body disappeared from his original spot in a ghost-like manner. The enormous tail violently swung over the place where Xiao Yan was originally at. That frightening force caused even the air to emit a low exploding sound wherever it passed. The invisible fire python turned its gaze after its futile strike. It swiftly discovered the black-colored human figure had flashed and appeared in the sky a hundred meters away. A dark coldness flashed across its enormous snake eyes. Torrents of invisible flames swiftly surged out from its body. Immediately, the enormous body of the invisible fire python once again disappeared within the flame... Xiao Yan was startled when he saw the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ disappear in such a strange manner. However, with Han Feng as a previous example, Xiao Yan could vaguely guess that the actual body of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ had turned into an ordinary flame and was hiding in this invisible flame that was sweeping over from all directions at this instant. “Be careful. Don’t be surrounded by those flame. As a pure ‘Heavenly Flame’, the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ can transform itself into any wisp within that flame. After which, it would agglomerate its actual body to perform an attack upon arriving at a spot that is around you.” Yao Lao serious warning sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart at the right time. Xiao Yan felt a chill within his heart when he heard this. He nodded slightly as he watched the invisible flames that came sweeping over from all directions. The pair of green flame wings on his back flapped and he rushed out from between a gap just before the surrounding flame managed to truly form a fire web. Xiao Yan’s body had just flashed out from the encirclement of the flame when he sensed an intense ripple from behind him. The corner of his eyes glanced over swiftly, only to realize that a part of the invisible flame had suddenly fluctuated. The enormous body of the fire python was vaguely visible within it. “Ji!” A sharp hissing sound suddenly roared through the sky as the invisible flame surfaced from a part of the flame. It eyed Xiao Yan who had escaped from being surrounded, and an extremely human-like fury immediately flashed across its snake eyes. It widened its enormous mouth and an invisible flame was immediately blasted toward Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan, who was alert, immediately turned his body when he sensed the hot temperature from behind him. He flipped his hands and two surging green flames erupted from his palm. Finally, they violently collided with the invisible flame under the gazes of a countless number of people. “Bang!” Another clear, loud sound erupted from the collision of the hot energy waves, causing the already dry area to become hotter. It gave people sunburns similar to those from a desert. With the help of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, Xiao Yan blocked that flame attack which even an ordinary elite Dou Wang would be unable to dodge. However, he did not have time to quietly rejoice when he sensed the energy that had suddenly surged within the sky above his head. Xiao Yan abruptly raised his head and immediately inhaled a breath of cool air. All he saw was that the clear sky had already been occupied by waves of invisible flame. Moreover, these flames were suspended around the body of the invisible fire python, much like soldiers who were ready to attack anytime. “Ji!” A sharp hissing suddenly sounded. Immediately, the flames all over the sky surged. Everyone could only use their shocked gazes to look at the invisible flames that came smashing down like meteorites. Those falling swishing sounds that filled the sky caused everyone to feel as though a great disaster had struck. Even though Xiao Yan had the support of Yao Lao’s strength, he still involuntarily felt fear within his heart at such a large scale frightening attack. Compared to the strength of the ‘Heavenly Flame,’ which agglomerated over an unknown number of years, the strength of a person did indeed appear to be extremely weak and insignificant. “The energy of this beast appears to be endless. It will only be a matter of time for it to defeat me if I continue to receive such unending attacks… Dammit, I must think of a way to seriously injure it!” Xiao Yan clenched his fist tightly as the perspiration all over his face came rolling down like a stream. His gaze was firmly focused on the invisible fire python in the sky. Although his thought was a good one, seriously injuring the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ was easier said than done. The powerful ‘Heavenly Flame’ attack by Han Feng earlier not only failed to cause it much damage but had instead infuriated it, resulting in him suffering greatly. “Calm your heart. All that you are seeing with your eyes now is merely the exterior body of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’. The true essence of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ is hidden at a certain spot on this enormous body. As long as you are able to find and damage the essence, the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ will naturally be seriously injured. If you were to randomly attack like that fellow, you would merely be wasting your strength!” Yao Lao’s low cry suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan’s heart just as the latter was feeling helpless. Xiao Yan body shook. He clenched his teeth and nodded before slowly exhaling a breath of air. His originally restless heart had become calm... The flame ran about all over the sky, much like the destruction of the world. This terrifying scene caused quite a number of people to feel their legs become weak. “Xiu! Xiu!” The flame was like a meteorite that carried an unceasing sound of rushing, hot wind as it descended from the sky! Si Qian and the others eyed the seemingly large scale destructive attack of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ in the sky. Their expressions immediately changed drastically. If this attack was to fall into the Inner Academy, it was likely that all the buildings within it would be instantly destroyed! The flame seal shined on Xiao Yan’s perspiration filled face. Numerous flames were swiftly gathering within his dark-black eyes. The black robe on Xiao Yan’s body was pressed tightly to his skin under the frightening wind. This soft robe appeared to have all its moisture removed at this moment, becoming totally dry and appearing as though it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. Xiao Yan focused his attention to its limit at this critical juncture. His eyes stared intently at those fire meteorites that came smashing over from all directions. Unbeknownst to him, all the noises in the outside world had become weak. Those clearly distinct colored eyes seemed to merely have some traces of the flame smashing down and the source of flame of the enormous being… Find… find the essence! Xiao Yan was muttering to himself within his heart. A wisp of green-colored flame quietly spread over his dark-black eyes. At a certain moment, the world in his eyes changed drastically. The invisible fire python in the sky, that possessed an enormous body, possessed a snake scale half a foot under its enormous mouth that slowly revealed a seemingly invisible intense flame light which one could feel… Found it! The flame in Xiao Yan’s eyes swiftly withdrew as he once again recovered his eyes clarity. A faint silver glow quietly became bright under his feet and the clear sound of rolling thunder slowly tumbled through the sky. An instant later, Xiao Yan abruptly leaped forward. Immediately… an afterimage remained where he was! “Chi! chi!” A countless number of gazes watched Xiao Yan who had suddenly moved. An instant later, all of them became stunned. All they could see was a black-robed figure would appear at the spot where the fire meteorite was after each silver flash. After which, an afterimage would be left behind… Numerous afterimages swiftly appeared in the sky while observed by a countless number of stunned gazes. The actual body that created the afterimages was just like lightning that quickly penetrated through the flame meteorites that spread all over the sky and approached the enormous being in it! The maximum speed he was displaying caused Xiao Yan to feel that the entire world had become extremely blurry. Only that cluster of invisible essence below the huge mouth of the fire python at the edge of his sight was bright and clear. “Roar!” A low, deep thunder-like roar was suddenly emitted from Xiao Yan’s mouth as the distance between the two parties became closer. He clenched his fist and the green-colored flame appeared to boil like an active spirit. He immediately used an extremely great speed to agglomerate the green-colored flame into an enormous spear! Xiao Yan’s feet stepped into the air. A thunderous flash appeared while afterimages lingered. Numerous vague black shadows appeared to have teleported and appeared in front of the invisible fire python under the intent focus of a countless number of gazes! The enormous body of the fire python caused one to involuntarily feel that they were small upon encountering it. A fear filled one’s heart under the focus of the enormous snake eyes. “Bastard, go and die!” The hot temperature caused a searing pain to be felt all over Xiao Yan’s body. However, his hand still held the long fire spear tightly. A sharp cry sounded. The huge fire spear turned into a lightning bolt that tore apart space as it carried a lightning-like momentum. It violently penetrated the snake scale underneath the enormous mouth of the fallen heart flame! “Foolish brat. He is definitely seeking death!” From the ground, Han Feng watched Xiao Yan who had actually dared to be this close to the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’. He immediately let out a cold laugh. Having exchanged blows with the latter, he was extremely clear about what kind of frightening strength this thing possessed. Even his earlier attack from the agglomeration of ‘Heavenly Flame’ was not effective, much less Xiao Yan’s attack. There were quite a number of people who held similar thoughts as Han Feng. Even the expression of Su Qian had sank a little. Dou Qi surged within his body as he readied himself to conduct a rescue. However, as everyone was laughing coldly or becoming anxious at this reckless action of Xiao Yan, the invisible fire python that was pierced by Xiao Yan abruptly lifted its huge head. A sharp sound that contained pain, that was difficult to hide, reverberated mournfully over the sky! The sharp shrill noise had just sounded when the body of the invisible fire python quietly became illusionary under numerous shocked gazes... “A perfect attack! Now, it is time for it to reveal its true form. Little fellow, prepare to snatch the ‘Heavenly Flame’!” Yao Lao’s laughter suddenly sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart. That laughter contained some relief and excitement.
