{"id":47382,"no":748,"title":"Chapter 748: He Gan","content":"Chapter 748: He Gan Xiao Yan lifted his brows when he heard the surprised sharp voice that was emitted from the mouth of the clan head of the He clan. He did not say anything. However, the surging Dou Qi that had swept out of his body did not weaken. A faint, fierce glow also flickered across his eyes. This posture of silent agreement by Xiao Yan caused the limbs of the head of the He clan to turn even more icy-cold. The current him really did have the impulse to knock his head against a wall and die. Of all people, why did he have to provoke this most frightening person in the entire Jia Ma Empire? With the reputation that the Yan Alliance currently had, it was likely that they would become the second ‘Misty Cloud Sect’ within a short period of time. A mere He clan was something that could be easily destroyed a couple of times in the eyes of such an enormous being. The face of the clan head of the He clan was volatile. A moment later, his entire body shivered when he sensed the pressure from the powerful aura. He hurriedly dispelled all his defense before bowing and speaking respectfully, “I was unaware that chief Xiao has honored us with your presence. I hope that chief Xiao could be magnanimous about my offenses earlier. The He clan will definitely listen to chief Xiao’s intention with regards to this matter!” Changing from the earlier dark coldness to this humble bowing. The transformation between the two had occurred within a near instant. All of mercenaries from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company and those guards from the He clan all widened their mouths, and stared at the clan head of the He clan who was bowing his body while opening his mouth, appearing like a servant. This sudden transformation caused them to have some difficulty recovering. The clan head of the He clan was unconcerned about those gazes around him. He lowered his head and looked at the pair of legs a short distance away. Cold perspiration repeatedly rolled down his forehead. Being a person who possessed some reputation and position within the empire, he heard more about the earth-shaking big battle, that occurred with the Misty Cloud Sect, compared to ordinary people. Hence, he understood best just what kind of frightening strength this black-robed, young man in front of him possessed. He did not think that he would have the chance of escaping from chief Xiao, who could defeat even Yun Shan at the Dou Zong class, even if he used his entire strength. Moreover, he was not alone. The large He clan still required his protection. Although the He clan possessed some reputation in this northwestern area, it was nothing in the eyes of a large being like the ‘Yan Alliance’. If Xiao Yan really wanted their He clan to disappear from the Jia Ma Empire, all that was needed was a word from him. Hence, groveling was actually the best method to protect both himself and the He clan after things had developed until this stage. On the other hand, if he were to act stubborn after having guessed the other person’s identity, their fate… he clearly understood that Xiao Yan was not an ordinary young fellow. His viciousness toward his enemy did not lose to an old crafty fellow. This action of the He clan’s head also caused those guards from the clan to be afraid to move. They were no fools and had similarly heard of this enormous being known as the ‘Yan Alliance’ that had just been born within the empire. They were still able to use their status as guards of the He clan to swagger around in front of these mercenary companies. However, this status was difficult to overcome in the eyes of the ‘Yan Alliance’, much like the gap between their He clan and the mercenary companies. “He… he is actually really that chief of the Yan Alliance who defeated Yun Shan, Xiao Yan?” Ling Er, Ka Gang, and the others displayed shocked eyes as they looked at the black-robed, young man, whose clothes were fluttering in the absence of any wind. A great storm appeared to have brewed within their hearts. Although they guessed that Xiao Yan was thought highly of, they still did not think that he would be the new overlord in the limelight of the entire Jia Ma Empire, the chief of the Yan Alliance! Of course, strictly speaking, it was not that they had never had this thought, but rather, they did not dare think it. This was because the impression that this chief of the Yan Alliance left in many people within the Jia Ma Empire was that he was overly mysterious and powerful. Some people’s hearts even treated him like a deity to worship. He had broken the unmoving position of the Misty Cloud Sect in the hearts of a countless number of people within the Jia Ma Empire. Hence, his position was unusually high. Even though they knew that Xiao Yan’s name was similar to that chief of the Yan Alliance, they still did continue this train of thought. That middle-aged man also forcefully swallowed a mouthful of saliva. His heart was filled with shock. Who would have imagined that this little mercenary company of theirs would actually be able to befriend such a legendary person. If this news was to spread, it was likely that their Bloody Battle Mercenary Company would be renowned throughout the entire empire. Their shock continued for a long time before gradually disappearing. Ka Gang and Ling Er secretly rubbed away the cold perspiration on their foreheads. The expressions on their faces were somewhat stiff. Ever since Xiao Yan appeared, he had repeatedly brought them shock. Even now, their hearts involuntarily felt a numb-feeling that did not recover to the shocked-feeling they had felt earlier. Xiao Yan was also startled by the change in the head of the He clan just like the others initially. He immediately looked at this old man with eyes that held a deeper meaning. This old man really understood the times. After understanding that he was no match for his opponent, he was actually able to change his mentality and obtain the most beneficial situation. Xiao Yan’s heart understood most clearly that if this old man still retained his attitude from the beginning even after this old man had guessed his identity, he would not resist using vicious means to eliminate him and the He clan behind him from the Jia Ma Empire. However, the head of this He clan had picked the mentality that he needed at the fastest speed after hesitating for a short period of time within his heart. After which, he gave up the dignity the head of a clan possessed and revealed a groveling side to Xiao Yan. This kind of transformation might appear somewhat shameless to other people, but from the way Xiao Yan looked at it, this old man was a person who could take what was put forth. He would not place the clan in danger because of his moment of pride. Strictly speaking, he could be considered a qualified person in charge of a clan. The powerful Dou Qi that surged out of Xiao Yan’s body was slowly withdrawn. Xiao Yan smiled partially and asked, “Why? Don’t you want those ‘Fire Lotus Bottles’?” Cold perspiration immediately flowed from the head of the He clan upon hearing this. He laughed dryly and said, “Chief Xiao is joking. I was blinded earlier. It is why I had placed my thoughts on you. Now that I know of your identity, I would not dare to offend you even if I had more guts.” “What is your name?” Xiao Yan smiled faintly as he inquired. “He Gan.” The clan head of the He clan hurriedly replied. Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His gaze glanced at those members from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company on the open ground and spoke calmly, “I have an old relationship with the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company. Let the matter today pass. Don’t blame me for being vicious if you were to secretly use any tactics.” “I will obey chief Xiao. Ke ke, if I had known earlier that the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company was acquainted with chief Xiao, I would not have come to find trouble even if I was given more guts. Consider today’s matter as being an offense from me, He Gan. I will definitely find a chance to apologize to the few leaders within the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company in the future.” He Gan hurriedly nodded. His gaze immediately turned and swept over everyone present while smiling friendly. Seeing He Gan’s smile, the middle aged man quickly cupped his hands. He knew that with He Gan’s strength, killing the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company was no hard feat. If it weren’t for Xiao Yan, they would have died already, let alone standing here. Thus, despite Xiao Yan’s power, he did not dare to do anything overboard. Xiao Yan nodded slightly. This He Gan really did know how to be courteous. Originally, given his strength, forcefully killing He Gan could be accomplished by a thought. However, there was a He clan that was joined behind He Gan. Now that Xiao Yan was about to undertake a retreat, he was naturally unwilling to spend such a great effort to act against the He clan. Hence, it was quite a good ending to get him to back down in the face of difficulty. “Ke ke, chief Xiao. My He clan has also received an invitation from the Yan Alliance. The old me thought it over for a long time and will likely join the alliance. We will contribute to the Yan Alliance in the future. At that time, ke ke, I will be chief Xiao’s subordinate and will need you to give me many chances.” He Gan also sighed in relief upon seeing Xiao Yan nod his head. He immediately laughed. Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He could not help but quietly laugh when he heard this. This old man could be considered an interesting person. He had only used a couple of sentences to turn their relationship into that of a boss and subordinate. However, Xiao Yan faintly knew a little about big brother’s plan from these words. He quietly praised within his heart. It seemed that big brother was planning to gradually have the Yan Alliance take control of the many factions within the empire. Like this, the strength of the Yan Alliance would truly soar. “I will naturally remember it as long as one is loyal to the alliance. If you provide great merit in the future, I dare not say that I will allow you to breakthrough to a Dou Huang but it is not a problem to help you reach the peak of the Dou Wang class.” Xiao Yan laughed faintly. Surprise immediately flashed across Hu Gan’s eyes upon hearing this promise from Xiao Yan. At this age of his, the difficulty of attempting to raise his strength by one star was quite great. He had never even dreamed of reaching the Dou Huang class. Being able to reach the peak of the Dou Wang class was the limit he dared to dream about. He immediately let out a respectful thanks. “Let the matter end here today. I still have some matters that require me to enter the Magical Beast Mountain Range. I believe that you will be able to settle the issues here properly.” Xiao Yan spoke slowly. “I will definitely not let you down, chief.” Hu Gan respectfully replied. Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He turned around and looked at the pale-faced Ka Gang. He smiled slightly and flicked a medicinal pill toward Ka Gang with his finger, “Uncle Ka Gang, this medicinal pill is able to let you completely recover within a short period of time. In the future, the He clan will not possess any other thoughts toward your Bloody Battle Mercenary Company.” “You flatter me, you flatter me. That… it is unexpected that little brother Xiao Yan is the chief of the Yan Alliance. I…” Ka Gang spoke helplessly. The strongest person whom this honest mercenary had seen in his life was the head of the He clan. Xiao Yan, who was the chief of the Yan Alliance, was somewhat too far away from him. He did not expect that the young man from back then, whom he had met by coincidence in the mountain forest, would actually become the master of the strongest faction within the Jia Ma Empire a couple of years later. Xiao Yan smiled. He cupped his hands toward Ka Gang and said, “Today’s matter have been settled. I have other important matters and will take my leave first.” After saying this, his gaze paused on Ling Er whose bright eyes had been staring at him beside Ka Gang. He smiled slightly, moved his body and transformed into a black shadow that shot into the sky. Ling Er’s eyes were startled as she looked at the black figure that had swiftly disappeared into the sky. Her eyes had an unusual glint flickering within them. The power and influence to cause an expert Dou Wang to grovel with the lift of an arm undoubtedly possessed a great attraction to quite a number of young ladies. The strong were forever the most glittering existence. Xiao Yan currently possessed such a qualification!
