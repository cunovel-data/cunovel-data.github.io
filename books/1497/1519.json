An indescribably high temperature filled this magma world. Even an elite Dou Sheng, who had reached the fourth star or even fifth star, would not be able to remain for long because the temperature present could even incinerate Dou Qi.\\n\\n Xun Er floated in the sky as a golden flame continued to surge from her body. Even though she the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame was guarding her, she was still drenched in perspiration. Fortunately, the Dou Qi within her body did not show signs of combusting. There was a reason the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame had obtained such a high rank.\\n\\n Xun Er’s eyes roamed the distant sky before finding the origin point of this sea of flames. A fire lotus with a demonic aura was slowly rotating at that spot. Each time it rotated, its color would flicker between dark-red and white.\\n\\n “Buzz!”\\n\\n The rotating fire lotus finally returned to a white, but its petals were covered with tiny red veins. At a glance, they appeared just like the blood vessels of a person. Occasionally, a red light flashed, causing this beautiful fire lotus to be filled with a demonic aura.\\n\\n “When I first met you back then, your body was as pure as a baby. I brought you intelligence, allowing you to possess the thoughts of a human. However, the path you have taken is opposite from what I had intended…” That illusory figure outside of ‘Xiao Yan’s’ body softly sighed as he studied the fire lotus, which was filled with a demonic aura.\\n\\n “Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, it is up to me how I wish to grow. You are meddling too much!” Light was emitted from the demonic lotus body as the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame furiously roared.\\n\\n “I only wish that you will avoid self-destructing. I am the one who has caused you to fill with this hatred, so allow me to finally end everything…” The illusory figure observed the fire lotus as his hand seal changed. The two large arrays that covered this realm suddenly rushed forward, one up and one down. Soon after they moved, a huge fire curtain shot out and swiftly formed a square prison, which sealed the demonic lotus inside.\\n\\n “I will remove the intelligence and memories that I have bestowed upon you. In the future, you will be as pure as when I had discovered you back then…”\\n\\n “Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, you heartless bastard. I will not allow you to do as you please!”\\n\\n A furious roar was once again emitted from the demonic lotus before it began rotating at a rapid speed. Waves of unusually terrifying blood-colored flames shot out of the demonic lotus. The fire curtain formed by the array suddenly became distorted because of these strange blood-colored flames.\\n\\n “I had thought of removing your memories when I had reached my limits back then, but I was unable to do remove them. This was why I sealed you here. I was hoping to resolve your brutalness and murderous nature. Looking at it now, the thousands of years of being sealed has caused your hatred to become even more intense. Since this is the case…” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint looked at the wildly struggling Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame and softly sighed. His hand seal changed and the massive formation suddenly began to collapse from its outer edges. Following the collapse of the outer parts of the formation, the fire pillar that had locked onto the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame became more solid.\\n\\n “Bang bang bang!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame wildly attacked the fire curtain as the formation rotated. That earth-shaking sounds of the collision caused the golden flame on the surface of Xun Er’s body to become a little dimmer.\\n\\n “Refining Sky Ancient Formation, remove!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’s illusory hand was gently waved, and one could see the fire curtain shot out many flame lines. These lines formed a fire web that was imprinted on the demonic lotus. After which, the fire web was slowly lifted as wisps of a blood-colored fog were pushed out of the body of the demonic lotus.\\n\\n “Ah!”\\n\\n A miserable screech was quickly emitted from the demonic lotus after this blood-colored fog appeared. The demonic lotus wildly rotated, but no matter what kind of powerful energy it unleashed, it was unable to break the fire curtain created from that formation.\\n\\n “The energy that the Refining Sky Ancient Formation has absorbed for thousands of years has been completely unleashed this time around. You will not be able to block it. Little demon, leave with me…”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint controlled the fire lines and forced out the blood-colored fog, which represented the memories and intelligence of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, a little at a time. A soft sound was emitted during the process.\\n\\n “Nonsense, without memories and intelligence, the Purifying Demonic Flame will no longer have its own consciousness in the future. What is the difference between this and killing me? You said that you would not take my life, but taking my memories and intelligence means that you intend to kill me, you hypocrite!” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s heart started to panic as he sensed his mind gradually become blank. He roared out loud. Once his memories and intelligence were completely removed, he would be considered ‘dead’...”\\n\\n “You are incomparably violent and have also obtained my inheritance. If you are allowed to break the seal, a great disaster will befall the world. This disaster was started by me. Naturally, it will have to be averted by me.” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’s illusory figure shook his head. He ceased saying anything more. His hand seal changed and the many lines of fire within the fire curtain suddenly surrounded the demonic lotus.\\n\\n “Ah!”\\n\\n Wave after wave of a dense blood fog swiftly surged out of the demonic lotus. The blood fog swiftly formed a blood figure in the air above the demonic lotus. This blood figure was the same human figure that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had appeared as before.\\n\\n The blood figure of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame tried to lower itself in an attempt to enter the demonic lotus after being forced out of its body. However, the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint did not give it such an opportunity. He clenched his hand and the fire curtain rapidly shank. The fore lines transformed into a ten-foot-large fire prison.\\n\\n “Master, master, please let me go this time around. I will definitely change in the future!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame struggled, but the demonic lotus was not able to break out of the fire prison. He began to feel afraid. Having left his body, his strength had diminished to less than ten percent of what it had been. It was unable to fight the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint now, so he knelt down and begged for mercy from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint.\\n\\n The illusory figure formed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint sighed when the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame started to beg for mercy. He waved his sleeves and the illusory figure left Xiao Yan’s body. The figure drifted into the fire prison and landed in front of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan ge-ge…”\\n\\n Xun Er hurriedly flew over and grabbed Xiao Yan after the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint had left Xiao Yan’s body.\\n\\n “Why have you not left?” Xiao Yan was not unconscious. His soul had been suppressed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. He involuntarily but softly chided Xun Er after escaping. He had watched this girl send Gu Nanhai flying and remain behind.\\n\\n Xun Er rejoiced in her heart after she made sure that Xiao Yan was fine. She wasn’t worried about Xiao Yan’s chiding. Her hand tightly grabbed his arm before her eyes landed on the fire curtain. Xiao Yan felt helpless once she grabbed him, but is large hand wrapped around Xun Er’s delicate and smooth hand.\\n\\n “Little demon, I do not hate you. Even though you retaliated against me back then, I still do not hate you. I have never had any disciples or any children in my life. Since the beginning, you have been the one closest to me…” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’s hand gently rubbed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s head. His somewhat illusory face revealed a warm smile.\\n\\n “However, I hate you!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame suddenly lifted his head. His blood-red eyes glared at the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. A bloody fog suddenly erupted and wrapped around the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. The bloody fog crazily eroded the the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’s body.\\n\\n Xiao Yan and Xun Er revealed startled faces as they watched this occur from outside the prison. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was far too violent.\\n\\n “This appearance is just like back then…”\\n\\n A faint tragic appearance overcame the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint’s face as he felt the erosion of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He softly sighed as he slowly reached out with his hand.\\n\\n “Together, we will disappear from this world forever…”\\n\\n The enormous fire arrays suddenly collapsed after the Purifying Lotus Demon Saint emitted this statement. Finally, they turned into two extremely bright lights that shot out and ruthlessly struck the fire curtain!\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan grabbed Xun Er’s delicate waist and extended his wings behind him upon sensing the explosion that could destroy the world. After which, he hurriedly pulled back.\\n\\n The storm swept over the realm. A hundred-thousand-foot-large crack appeared in the sea of magma. Such an enormous crack was something that the magma present could not fill.\\n\\n The sky was completely empty. Only after the wild and violent energy storm disappeared did Xiao Yan and Xun Er finally appear. They exchanged glances with each other before they quickly rushed to the center of the explosion.\\n\\n Light flickered in the sky as Xiao Yan and Xun Er paused their bodies. They searched the empty area. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint and the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had completely disappeared. It was as though they had vanished amid that earth-shaking collision earlier.\\n\\n “Where is the demonic flame essence…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan muttered as he looked at the empty sky. Could the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame have been destroyed in that explosion? If that was the case, would it not mean that this fight for the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was a waste?\\n\\n “Damnit.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan cursed with dissatisfaction. He had collected the ancient maps for over a decade because of this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. After which, he had waited for three years. Was really possible that he had ended with this result?\\n\\n “Xiao Yan ge-ge, look!”\\n\\n While Xiao Yan was filled with dissatisfaction in his heart, Xun Er suddenly pointed her finger at the magma sea region below and joyously cried out.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes scanned the direction she had pointed in. His heart seemed to have been pinched.\\n\\n There was a white lotus covered with pink veins as an endless sea of magma slowly swimming around. It seemed as the energy of the entire magma sea was surging toward it…\\n\\n “Demon flame essence…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s body involuntarily shook from excitement as he stared at the cream-white lotus with its faint pink color.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1519","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
