He put in all his effort to heal his body’s injuries as soon as possible without receiving any sequelae.\n The injuries that Xiao Yan received this time around were more serious compared to any other time. Hence, even with his strong physical body and his knowledge in alchemy, attempting to fully recover still required him to spend quite a long period of time. Xiao Yan did not appear frustrated because of this. Nothing wrong could happen during something like recuperation. Otherwise, his situation would be even worse if he added injuries on top of injuries within his body. For someone with Xiao Yan’s strength, it was not frightening to receive some injuries. What was frightening was when injuries left behind a sequela that posed an enormous hindrance toward him when he attempted to charge to a higher level.\n However, this kind of worry was not considered a big matter for Xiao Yan. Being an alchemist, he knew just how he could use the safest method to allow himself to gradually recover. All he needed was some time…\n A black-robed, young man was seated on a rock bed in a quiet chamber within the Xiao clan. Both of his hands formed a seal and his breathing was slow and long. The surrounding air would ripple each time he inhaled and exhaled. Immediately, an energy that was visible to the naked eye followed his breathing and swiftly entered his body…\n The inhalation and exhalation of energy continued for nearly an hour. Only then did Xiao Yan slowly open his eyes. A faint fire glow slowly rushed through his dark-black eyes before it immediately disappeared. His black pupils gradually became as calm as a rippless old well.\n Xiao Yan’s finger rubbed his ‘Serene Sea Storage Ring’ as he gently exhaled a breath of air. A sleek, round dark-green medicinal pill appeared in his hand. A medicinal fragrance that caused one to be intoxicated spread out the moment the medicinal pill appeared. One’s spirit would be braced slightly if one were to inhale it into their body.\n This medicinal pill was named ‘Yuan Recovery Pill’. It was a kind of healing medicine. However, its tier was quite high with it being a tier five pill. This medicinal pill was specially used to treat some serious injuries. Moreover, due to the gentle medicinal effect, it would not create even the slightest damage within one’s body. It could really be called the ultimate medicinal pill to treat serious injuries. However, due to the medicinal pill being of quite a high-tier, it was quite troublesome to refine it. An ordinary expert would have difficulty receiving such a treatment even if he were to be seriously injured. It was fortunate that Xiao Yan was an alchemist, a tier six alchemist at that. One who could refine a tier six medicinal pill. Otherwise, one would have to spend quite a bit of effort to beg for this kind of medicinal pill.\n Xiao Yan carelessly flicked the medicinal pill into his mouth. It melted when it entered his mouth and transformed into a warm energy that slowly seeped into one’s body. Finally, it moved along his four limbs and hundreds of bones as it swiftly spread, causing Xiao Yan’s entire body to be filled with a warm feeling. The throbbing pain that had been transmitted from his Qi Paths, which were originally injured, had weakened.\n Xiao Yan flipped his hand once again after swallowing the ‘Yuan Recovery Pill’. A jade bottle that contained a bright-red medicinal liquid appeared in his hand.\n Xiao Yan opened the sleeves on his right hand and revealed it. Originally, this hand had been cracked opened. However, during this period of time where Xiao Yan was carefully recuperating, the torn bone had slowly healed. However, just relying on the Dou Qi to keep it warm was not possible to completely heal it to its previous condition. One would also need other rare medicines that could replenish the bones in order to do so.\n The jade bottle tilted slightly and the bright-red medicinal liquid flowed out. Finally, it poured over Xiao Yan’s right hand. The moment the medicinal liquid made contact with his hand, an unusual ‘Chi Chi’ sound was emitted. The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth also twitched, and the heat caused his entire hand to appear as though it had been placed in a furnace.\n Although waves of searing pain were transmitted from Xiao Yan’s hand, Xiao Yan did not panic. He knew that this was a normal condition. With a flick of his finger, a jade piece appeared in his hand before he carefully spread the bright-red medicinal liquid. Finally, his entire right wrist was covered with the bright-red medicinal liquid.\n Within a short couple of breaths after the medicinal liquid was parted, it moved along his pores and entered his body. The bones in Xiao Yan’s hand also transmitted waves of numb-feeling at this moment.\n “This ‘Nine Ganoderma Bone Mending Cream’ does indeed have quite a good effect…” Joy flashed across Xiao Yan’s face as he sensed the numb feeling transmitted from his bones. He could clearly sense the bones in his hand swiftly healing. The weak-feeling that he felt when he clenched his fist in the past also quietly withdrew. Replacing it was a feeling of strength!\n Xiao Yan only ceased the actions of his hand after waiting for the medicinal liquid’s effects to be completely unleashed. He stored the jade bottle into his storage ring, looked at his red right hand and smiled. According to this speed, it was likely that the broken bones in his arm would completely recover after applying it a couple more times.\n “I have recovered around fifty-percent to sixty-percent of the Dou Qi in my body. However, this amount of Dou Qi is comparable to seventy-percent to eighty-percent of my Dou Qi in the past. It seems that I really did obtain wonderful benefits from this big battle. It is just that I am uncertain whether or not I will come into contact with the barrier of the Dou Huang class once all of my Dou Qi is recovered.” Xiao Yan softly muttered as he sensed the powerful Dou Qi that was flowing within the Qi Paths in his body.\n Xiao Yan mused for a moment while speaking to himself. He suddenly clenched his hand and a cluster of jade-green flames appeared on his hand.\n Xiao Yan’s other hand flicked as his gaze stared intently at the cluster of ‘Glazed Lotus Core Flame’. The dense white fire seal on his forehead emitted a slight hot flow. Immediately, a white flame emitted a ‘chi’ sound and rose from within Xiao Yan.\n Xiao Yan was startled as he looked at this cluster of dense white flames. His hand gently rubbed the white fire seal on his forehead and sensed the temperature within before sighing in relief. Yao Lao had mentioned that as long as the fire seal still existed, it meant that he was still alive. From the looks of it, the situation that Xiao Yan dreaded the most did not appear.\n “Teacher, rest assured that I will raise my strength as quickly as possible and rescue both father and you!” Xiao Yan clenched his fist tightly. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes as he spoke within his heart.\n The ‘Heavenly Flame’ on both of his hands swiftly disappeared as his mind moved. His gaze once again landed on that dark-black ring. The ring was connected with Yao Lao’s spirit and was where he rested in the past; therefore, Xiao Yan was unable to enter it. However, now that he had the essence body of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’, Xiao Yan was also able to control this ancient black ring as he wished.\n A layer of faint dense white flames surfaced on his finger. He gently his rubbed over the dark-black ring, and his Spiritual Strength entered into the space within the ring without any obstruction.\n The space within this dark-black ring was something that even the high grade ‘Sea Serene Storage Ring’ on Xiao Yan’s hand had difficulty comparing to. Of course, the most valuable thing was not this ring but the many things that were stored within the ring.\n Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength swiftly swept over the interior of the storage ring. His expression was somewhat dull. Within the storage ring was all that Yao Lao had accumulated in his lifetime. Medicinal Formulas, Qi Methods, Dou Techniques, and some other strange things were piled inside it. A wide range of things were piled together, causing his eyes to be dazzled.\n Xiao Yan randomly flipped some of the Qi Methods and Dou Techniques. He was once again speechless to discover that it was extremely difficult to find any low class items within them. The lowest class of Qi Methods and Dou Techniques were all at the Xuan Class Low Level. Xiao Yan actually even saw some Di class Qi Methods and Dou Techniques upon detailed observation. However, it was obvious that there were very few items of this class. After counting, the combined number of them did not exceeded twenty.\n Despite this, the things that were hidden here already caused Xiao Yan to be astounded. This was really a treasure repository that was sufficient enough to cause a countless number of people to flock over in doves. Fortunately, only he alone was aware of these things. Otherwise, anyone who possessed so many high class Qi Methods and Dou Techniques would definitely invite the envy of a countless number of people.\n Xiao Yan withdrew his Spiritual Strength after roughly flipping through the space. A reel that was completely jade-like was taken out while he withdrew.\n His hand played with the jade-green scroll in his hand. After observing it with his spiritual strength earlier, he was already aware that this was the method to resolve the ‘Life Devouring Pill’ that was within Xiao Li’s body that Yao Lao had left behind.\n If one counted the time, time was almost up for Xiao Li since the moment that he swallowed the ‘Life Devouring Pill’ until now. Therefore, Xiao Yan had to maximize his time to resolve this matter. Otherwise, it was likely that Xiao Li would instantly die. At that time, forget about Xiao Yan’s own pain, he did not even know how to account to his big brother. Until now, the two of them had not brought up this matter to Xiao Ding. This was because they knew that given Xiao Ding’s temper, it was likely that he would end up viciously reprimanding the two of them if he were aware of these matters.\n Xiao Yan slowly pulled opened the scroll. The bold and vigorous words, that caused Xiao Yan to feel somewhat familiar, appeared in his eyes, causing him to sigh softly.\n “Little fellow, the ‘Life Devouring Pill’ has a medicinal effect that is too overbearing. Even I have difficulty completely eliminating it. However, there is no need to feel disappointed. It is not that there is no solution. The ‘Life Devouring Pill’ uses a person’s life force to obtain strength. Since we cannot undo it, we should raise the life force of the person consuming the medicinal pill. In this way, it would enable the person who consumed the medicinal pill to extend his life for a period of time. Of course, this is merely a temporary expedient. If you want to completely eliminate it, it would require the consumer to breakthrough to the Dou Huang class during his remaining life. Breaking through to the Dou Huang class would truly enable one to resolve the ‘Life Devouring Pill’!”\n Xiao Yan’s gaze looked over the words on the scroll once over completely. A moment later, joy surged over Xiao Yan’s face. Teacher’s method was not too complicated. Since the ‘Life Devouring Pill’ is supported by lifeforce, it is possible to use medicinal pills that could raise one’s life force to extend second brother’s life. Whether Xiao Li would be able to breakthrough to the Dou Huang class could only be seen in the future.\n Although this method was simple, it included a big problem. It was that the medicinal pills that could raise one’s life force were very rare. It was difficult to find. However, this was not some overly difficult thing for Yao zhu-zhe, who was renowned throughout the continent.\n TL: zun-zhe - a respectful form of address for a Dou Zun.\n Xiao Yan’s gaze shifted down slowly. Finally, it paused on the last portion and his heart heaved a long sigh of relief.\n “Deep Green Longevity Pill, a tier six medicinal pill that is able to raise one’s lifespan by nearly ten years. One individual can only consume one pill in their lifetime. The refining ingredients, Deep Green Fruit, King Longevity Starch, Ten Thousand Years Vine…”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-730","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
