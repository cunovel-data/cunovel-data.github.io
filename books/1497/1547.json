He immediately swung his head and recovered. He softly laughed, “Have you completed your retreat?”\\n\\n “Aye.”\\n\\n Cai Lin smiled. Her narrow pretty eyes slowly swept over Xiao Yan. Her narrow, crescent-like eyebrows were lifted. She asked, “Has your strength grown significantly again?”\\n\\n “I cannot compare with you.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan spread his hands. His eyes were a little helpless as he looked at Cai Lin. From the way Cai Lin had appeared, it was obvious that her strength had soared to a relatively powerful level during this retreat. This had left him a little speechless. He had also headed to the bottom of the spring, but he had not found anything unusual about it. After Cai Lin had entered this so-called ‘ordinary’ spring, she had ended up gaining a lot. This blessing really caused one to feel envious.\\n\\n “Is that so?”\\n\\n Cai Lin shifted her feet. She carried a tempting fragrance as she approached Xiao Yan. Her pretty eyes slightly flickered. Her long delicate finger suddenly pressed toward Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed. A nine-colored luster was vaguely present on the tip of her finger while a mysterious energy quietly spread from it.\\n\\n Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head upon seeing her test his strength. A pink flame rose in front of him and Cai Lin’s finger dangerously paused outside of the flame. She glanced at Xiao Yan and said in a regretful voice, “I thought that I would have surpassed you after exiting my retreat.”\\n\\n Even now, Cai Lin deeply remembered the feeling of being far stronger than Xiao Yan back then. However, her somewhat strong self was a little depressed that something like being stronger than Xiao Yan would likely never appear again.\\n\\n Xiao Yan was helpless. Cai Lin seemed to have once again become that Queen Medusa of the past, who was difficult to tame, after exiting this retreat. She was cold and enchanting. Additionally, she also possessed an even greater confidence.\\n\\n “Alright, stop messing around. What level is your strength now?” Xiao Yan bitterly laughed in his heart. He quickly became serious and asked after discovering that his Spiritual Perception was unable to detect Cai Lin’s actual strength. Not because she had surpassed him, rather it was due to Cai Lin’s aura being overly mysterious. It was impossible for him to gauge it.\\n\\n “It should be around that of a four star Dou Sheng…” Cai Lin also smiled and replied honestly after seeing Xiao Yan become serious. Regardless of how powerful she was and how strong she acted in public, she still displayed a rare warmth and obedience in front of her man.\\n\\n “That attack from earlier does not seem like something a four star Dou Sheng can use…” Xiao Yan slightly lifted an eyebrow. That shrinking snake net Cai Lin had unleashed earlier caused even someone as powerful as Huang Tian to have no choice but to temporarily take shelter. A mere four star Dou Sheng was unable to do that.\\n\\n “I borrowed an external strength…”\\n\\n Cai Lin naturally did not hide anything from Xiao Yan. She took a step forward and became closer to Xiao Yan. After which, she lifted her hand. Her sleeve fell and revealed her jade-like wrist. There were many seven-colored snake symbols extending from her wrist up her arm. Only some snake symbols were present outside. They contained an unusual charm that tempted one into trying to probe deeper.\\n\\n A strange expression flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he studied her arm. His large hand grabbed Cai Lin’s seemingly boneless wrist in front of many envious and fiery hot eyes. His finger gently rubbed the many seven-colored snake symbols. A grave and shocked expression surged into his eyes a moment later because he discovered that these snake symbols actually possessed their own life force. In other words, these snake symbols were not energy bodies. They were genuine Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Pythons!\\n\\n “The bottom of the Nine Serene Spring hides the lair of a tribe of Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python. I have obtained the inheritance of their ancestors. There are some ancestors among them with part of their souls still present despite their damaged physical bodies. I have awakened them, and they have attached to my body. I was only able to fight Huang Tian by borrowing their strength. Otherwise, if I merely relied on myself, it is likely that I would not have been able to defeat Huang Tian.” Cai Lin softly explained.\\n\\n “So this is the reason…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan only came to a sudden understanding in his heart after hearing Cai Lin’s brief explanation. Who would have imagined that the bottom of the Nine Serene Spring actually hide the remains of a lair belonging to the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python tribe. It was truly a lucky encounter for Cai Lin.\\n\\n This world was filled with all sorts of mysterious encounters. The reason he was able to obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame could be considered his own mysterious encounter.\\n\\n “Will there be any problems?” Xiao Yan’s finger gently pressed down on a snake symbol on Cai Lin’s arm as he inquired.\\n\\n “Although these ancestors possess some soul fragments, they are not complete souls. From a certain point of view, they can all be controlled by me…” Cai Lin’s expression was a little dispirited as she replied.\\n\\n Xiao Yan relaxed only after hearing this. He comforted, “It’s fine. If we have the opportunity in the future, we can try and see if we can repair their souls… however, the most important thing now is to resolve the trouble in front of us.” Xiao Yan’s eyes shifted to the mountain ruins as he spoke. A miserable figure had struggled into the air from that spot. That figure was Huang Tian, who had suffered a heavy blow from Cai Lin.\\n\\n Cai Lin by the side also slightly nodded. Her pretty eyes shifted to Huang Tian. The warm smile on her face had been wiped away. Her eyes had gained a cold glint as murderous intent surged within them.\\n\\n “Cough…”\\n\\n Huang Tian coughed intensely in front of the countless pairs of eyes. He wiped off the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth. His eyes glanced at Xiao Yan and Cai Lin in the distance in a sinister manner. Panic flashed across his heart. He was still unafraid if Xiao Yan was alone, but another had appeared, who could seriously injure him. Even Huang Tian would feel a great pressure if these two cooperated.\\n\\n “Had I known that Xiao Yan’s woman was a Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python, I would not have intervened… dammit.”\\n\\n Huang Tian’s eyes flickered. His heart felt regretful. Originally, he thought that this matter would not be troublesome. Who would have expected such an expected change to suddenly occur?\\n\\n The entire sky was quiet while Huang Tian was silent. Those experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe exchanged glances with each other. None of them dared to speak. Even the almighty Huang Tian in their eyes had been beaten into such a miserable state. Their pride from earlier had already been scattered by Xiao Yan and Cai Lin’s ferociousness.\\n\\n “Ha ha, chief Huang Tian, are you planning to continue on trying to capture your target?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan glanced at Huang Tian, who had become quiet. Finally, he opened his mouth and broke the silence.\\n\\n Huang Tian’s face twitched upon hearing this question. His expression was volatile as it continued to rapidly change. Finally, he said in a hoarse voice, “Xiao Yan, this king has lost this time around.”\\n\\n An uproar was immediately stirred after Huang Tian’s words escaped his mouth. No one had expected the tribal chief of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, who was renowned within the Beast Region, to actually admit defeat!\\n\\n “You don’t really think that this matter can be put to rest just by admitting defeat, do you?” XIao Yan’s voice contained some ridicule. However, both of his eyes contained a chill.. If he had come a little later today, something might have gone wrong with Cai Lin’s training. How would he face Xiao Xiao if anything happened?\\n\\n “Shall we kill him?” Cai Lin by the side inquired in a faint voice. A murderous intent was revealed in her tone.\\n\\n Huang Tian’s expression was a little ugly after seeing that Xiao Yan did not stop coming after him. He coldly said, “Saying that I admit defeat does not mean that I am afraid of you. If we were to really engage in an all out fight, I would still be able to pull one of you into death’s embrace even if I cannot win!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan shifted his eyes. The chill in his eyes did not diminish while a nine-colored luster surged onto the surface of Cai Lin’s body by the side.\\n\\n Yao Ming in the distance widened his mouth upon seeing them prepare. However, he eventually stopped himself from speaking. From his point of view, it would not be beneficial if Xiao Yan really killed Huang Tian. At that time, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe would definitely seek a crazy vengeance. Faced with one of the three great tribes, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, even the Sky Mansion Alliance would end up with a great headache. If the Hall of Souls were to quietly intervened, it might end up causing a great disaster for the Sky Mansion Alliance, which could destroy it for good.\\n\\n “You!”\\n\\n Huang Tian’s expression was a little gloomy, but his heart felt bitter. Given his current condition, he would most likely end up dead if he were to deal with Xiao Yan and Cai Lin together.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, this king will inform you of some news. Perhaps you will no longer be interested in remaining here after hearing it.”\\n\\n Huang Tian’s eyes flashed. He violently clenched his teeth as he spoke in a deep voice.\\n\\n “Oh? Why don’t you tell me and we’ll see.” Xiao Yan lifted his brows and replied with a calm expression.\\n\\n “Aren’t you wondering why this king has chosen to launch a campaign and attract you over from the Central Plains now instead of earlier or later?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression slightly sank. His eyes locked onto Huang Tian as he demanded, “Why?”\\n\\n Huang Tian smiled upon seeing Xiao Yan’s reaction. He suddenly asked, “It seems that your relationship with the new dragon emperor of the Ancient Void Dragon tribe is quite good, right?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression gradually became ugly. His heart began to feel an unease. His tone was dense as he said, “Do not try my limited patience…”\\n\\n “Hee, if I was you, I would immediately hurry to the Empty Realm now. Otherwise, I’m afraid that you will only be able to go and collect the corpse of the new Dragon Emperor…” Huang Tian laughed, “That young thing really doesn’t know her limits. Does she really think that it is so easy to unite the Ancient Void Dragon tribe?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression became completely gloomy. He suddenly lifted his palm. The dragon seal present on his palm had actually gradually dimmed at this moment. His limbs immediately became ice-cold.\\n\\n “Let’s go!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan struck his palm forward without explaining anything. He tore through empty space. Without saying anything more, he moved his body and swiftly entered. Cai Lin behind him frowned slightly before she hurriedly followed.\\n\\n “Huang Tian, I will remember this matter today. If anything happens to Zi Yan, I will get your entire Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe to repay with your lives!”\\n\\n A cold smile had just appeared on Huang Tian’s face as he watched Xiao Yan and Cai Lin hurriedly leaving when the dense voice that was emitted from the spatial crack froze his smile.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1547","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
