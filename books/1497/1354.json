The current him did not have much time to waste!\n “The crystal wall here seems to be exceptionally hard. Even its color is even denser than what we have seen before…”\n Xiao Yan’s eyes revealed an expression of deep thought. He immediately inhaled a deep breath of air. After taking a step forward, his body merged with the fire dragon. He swung his right fist and a hot whistle buzzed within the tunnel in an ear-piercing manner.\n “Bang!”\n Xiao Yan’s right fist swiftly merged with the fire dragon. After which, it was suddenly thrown forward and ruthlessly smashed into the emerald wall. A low and deep explosion suddenly resounded as intense rippling forces began to swiftly spread from Xiao Yan’s fist, causing the tunnel to shake…\n “Crack!”\n A tiny crack line began to explode in the crystal wall in front of everyone’s anxious eyes. This crack line began to rapidly spread. Finally, it emitted a ‘bang’ in front of everyone’s joyous eyes and exploded.\n Xiao Yan’s hand suddenly grabbed at the crystal chips flying in all directions when the crystal wall burst apart. A warm jade-like thing landed in his hand. At this moment, Xiao Yan did not pay too much attention to it. He put it into his Storage Ring.\n “Let’s go!”\n Xiao Yan’s feet stomped on the ground after shattering the last crystal wall. His body took the lead to rush forward. Behind him, Gu Qing Yang and the rest, who had already prepared, followed close behind as they charged towards the enormous hole that Xiao Yan had created…\n Xiao Yan was extremely quick. Within the blink of an eye, he had already charged out of the tunnel. After which, an endless gray land appeared in his sight…\n This land was extremely vast. One could not see a boundary at a glance. There was also not a dense energy fog lingering over the ground. When Xiao Yan’s group stood here, they were able to sense wave after wave of pure energy seeping into their bodies from under their feet. This kind of discovery caused everyone to feel stunned. A joy that could not be hidden quickly surged onto their faces. The third level of the Heavenly Tomb was indeed far from what the previous two levels could compare with. With this kind of energy pouring in, it was likely that they would be able to obtain a good training effect even if they did not go and search for energy cores.\n “Is this the third level of the Heavenly Tomb…”\n The group had a joyous face as they looked around them. The feeling of having been reborn after a disaster caused everyone’s heart to sigh in relief.\n “Buzz buzz!”\n While everyone was sighing in relief, the enormous light curtain behind, which seemed to be connected to the horizon, suddenly emitted an intense buzzing sound. This scene caused Xiao Yan’s group to feel shocked. Their bodies began to rapidly pull back.\n “Buzz buzz!”\n While Xiao Yan’s group was pulling back, wave after wave of a snow-white torrent rushed over to them with lightning-like speed. The wave was accompanied by a loud buzzing sound.\n “Ancient Devouring Insects! They have come chasing after us!”\n The expressions of Gu Qing Yang and the rest immediately changed when they saw this wave. Their bodies began to hurriedly withdraw.\n “Buzz buzz!”\n The white torrent surged out in all directions. However, the flying bodies of Ancient Devouring Insects came to a sudden halt soon after they had charged out of the energy wall. A puff could be heard as they turned into a cluster of white powder that scattered in front of everyone’s stunned eyes.\n “Puff puff puff!”\n After one minute, a continuous stream of Ancient Devouring Insects began to charge out of the tunnel without being afraid of death. However, they were repelled by a mysterious strength when they charged ten feet away from the light curtain. Suddenly, they burst into white powder. In the end, the powder accumulated in front of the energy wall until it was a couple of meters high…\n “These Ancient Devouring Insects… what are they doing?” Everyone was stunned as they watched these Ancient Devouring Insects continuously charge out despite clearly knowing that only death waited for them. All of them began to frown.\n “Could it be that they do not wish for us to escape?” A person bitterly laughed and gave a suggestion.\n “They would not go all out if their intention was to not allow us to escape. They are committing suicide, and it is a pointless suicide…” Gu Qing Yang shook his head and spoke with knit brows.\n A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s heart while everyone was pondering what was jappening with some doubt. His finger rubbed his Storage Ring without anyone noticing. Could it be related to the thing that he had grabbed from the crystal wall?\n “Buzz buzz!”\n The Ancient Devouring Insect’s suicidal charge continued for nearly ten minutes. The white powder covered the energy wall in a thick layer. However, it was fortunate that this kind of suicide did not continue on. After a countless number of Ancient Devouring Insects had been turned to dust, the charging speed finally slowed before completely disappearing. Clearly, this useless suicide had finally caused them to give up.\n “Let’s go…”\n Gu Qing Yang shook his head and spoke after seeing these Ancient Devouring Insects shrink back into the crystal wall.\n Xiao Yan also recovered when he heard his words. Suddenly, he turned his head and swept it around. Then he began to frown because he had discovered that Hun Ya’s group had already fled while everyone was stunned by the wild suicide of the Ancient Devouring Insects earlier.\n “Those two fellows are really cunning…”\n Xun Er had also discovered that the two people had disappeared. She bunched up her brows and commented.\n “Ha ha, brother Xiao Yan, it is all thanks to you this time around. Since we have reached the third level, the two of us shall not continue to stand here for long. We will find a place to train. After which, we will quietly wait for three years to be up…” Huo Xuan cupped his hands to Xiao Yan and spoke with a smile.\n Xiao Yan also grinned and nodded. He cupped his hands in return and said, “In that case, I wish brother Huo Xuan a peaceful journey.”\n “Goodbye. See you when three years are up.” Huo Xuan laughed. After which, he led Huo Zhi into the distance.\n After Hou Xuan, the Shi clan, and the Lei clan said their goodbyes and left. Yao Xing Ji merely glanced at Xiao Yan before flinging his sleeves and leading that bewitching lady from the Yao clan away without saying any polite words.\n Within a short couple of minutes, this place had become empty after many people left. Only Xiao Yan’s group still remained.\n “Xun Er, where are the both of you going?” Gu Qing Yang looked at the two, mused for a moment, and finally asked about their plans.\n “Is big brother Qing Yang still not aware of where we are going?” Xun Er faintly smiled and replied.\n Gu Qing Yang helplessly shook his head when he heard this. He looked at Xiao Yan and said, “You really intend to visit Xiao Xuan’s tomb. That place is in the deepest regions of the Heavenly Tomb. It is extremely easy to find eight or nine star energy bodies there. It is still fine if you meet one or two of them. If there are too many, it will be extremely dangerous. Moreover… there might even be Dou Sheng class energy bodies in the deepest regions. You might really end up dying if you meet them.”\n Xiao Yan nodded and said, “I know…”\n Gu Qing Yang felt somewhat helpless when he saw that Xiao Yan had no intention of giving up. He hesitated for a moment before turning his head to look at the silver-robed man, Gu Zhen, and that burly man. He inquired, “What plans do all of you have? Are you going to randomly find a place and train for three years?”\n “Do you think that is possible? Before we entered the Heavenly Tomb, I was informed by Elder Tong Xuan to protect Xun Er. I think that I am likely not the only one who has received such an instruction.” Gu Zhen lifted his head and smiled as he replied.\n “Me too…” The silver-robed man shrugged his shoulder. After which, he looked at Xiao Yan and laughed, “I have not been able to introduce myself. I am Gu Hua, the second general of the Black Submerged Army. In the past, I had been unaware of why Xun Er had chosen you. Now that I look at it, I have perhaps obtained some answers…”\n “I have also received that order…” The burly-looking man, who appeared a little simple and honest, laughed, “Gu Xing, third commander of the Black Submerged Army. We have you to thank for back there…”\n Xiao Yan smiled and cupped his hands together. Gu Qing Yang and the other two generals were not filled with enmity, especially after the events within the light curtain. They were clearly a little friendlier to him. Hence, Xiao Yan did not treat the three of them in a cold and indifferent manner.\n “Looks like this is the case for everyone…” Gu Qing Yang spread his hands and laughed, “Since this is the case, let’s travel together. With the few of us joining hands, nothing unexpected should happen as long as we do not meet any Dou Sheng class energy bodies. Whether you will be able to enter Xiao Xuan’s tomb, will all depend on you. The experts from our Gu clan once reached that place. However, we do not have a way in. No matter what method we tried, we were unable to enter… therefore, you should be mentally prepared. Perhaps your ancestor does not want anyone to enter and disturb him.”\n Xiao Yan slightly grinned. He nodded and said, “My instincts tell me that I will likely gain something there.”\n “Hopefully…”\n Gu Qing Yang was unconcerned. He lifted his head and glanced over the grayish-brown land. After which, he exhaled and smiled as he said, “In that case, we should get moving. I really wish to see just how frightening the third level of the Heavenly Tomb is!”\n “Aye, let’s get moving…”\n Xiao Yan also laughed. After which, he exchanged glances with Xun Er. Subsequently, their toes pressed on the ground and their figures turned into two rays of light that took the lead as they swiftly rushed to the third level. Gu Qing Yang and the three others swiftly followed behind…\n Two black figures slowly appeared a great distance from Xiao Yan’s group. They were Hun Ya and Hun Li, who had fled long ago.\n “Gu Qing Yang’s group has joined Xiao Yan and Xun Er…” Hun Li turned his head, looked into the distance, and made a comment.\n “Together, huh… it’s just as well. It will save us some trouble when the time comes…” Hun Ya indifferently nodded. A brutal expression flashed across his lowered eyes.\n “Xiao Yan, the next time we meet, will be the time when we take your life. Just you wait!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1354","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
