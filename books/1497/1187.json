Lightning flashed by and a glaring light landed on Old Mu Gu’s face, causing him to appear exceptionally strange.\\n\\n The large light pillar shot to the sky in front of numerous eyes. The vast, mighty strength within the light pillar caused the expressions of those present to change in shock. Looking at the energy ripple from the light, it was likely that those who had appeared earlier had yet to reach this level!\\n\\n Just what great being was this mysterious, black-clothed person?\\n\\n Countless numbers of people felt some surprise in their hearts at this moment. Those who possessed such an ability would definitely not be unknown.\\n\\n Of course, an ordinary person might not be able to recognize him, but the expressions of Xuan Kong Zi and the rest on the tall stage slowly became gloomy at this moment. The light pillar rushed up. That aura, which Old Mu Gu had been hiding, completely erupted at this moment.\\n\\n “Old Mu Gu…”\\n\\n The smile on Xuan Kong Zi’s face was slowly withdrawn. His eyes revealed an icy chill as he stared at the black-clothed figure while speaking his name a syllable at a time.\\n\\n “It is unexpected that he was able to hide from the three of us… moreover, his appearance has also been altered…” A chill flashed across the face of the pretty woman at this moment while she spoke in a solemn voice.\\n\\n “Three association heads, what should we do now?”\\n\\n A white-robed, old man behind Xuan Kong Zi’s trio revealed a slight change in expression as he hurriedly asked in a soft voice.\\n\\n From the looks of the current situation, this Old Mu Gu had clearly come prepared. If this were allowed to continue, it was likely that he would really end up obtaining the champion position of this Pill Gathering. At that time, the Pill Tower would lose a great amount of face. After all, everyone knew that the Pill Tower and the Hall of Souls were adversaries. If the other party were to obtain the highest honor of this Pill Tower, just how comical would it appear if word of it spread to the ears others?\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi’s expression also became unusually gloomy. Both of his hands were slowly clenched. A moment later, they slowly relaxed. He said in a deep voice, “Let’s wait and see. It is already too late to do anything now. We have really failed to take sufficient precautions. Although Old Mu Gu is a member of the Hall of Souls, he is also an alchemist and possesses the qualifications to participate in the Pill Gathering. If we were to intervene and remove his right to participate in public, not only will the Hall of Souls not let the matter rest but our Pill Tower’s reputation will be damaged.”\\n\\n “Do we just allow him to obtain the champion position?” That white-robed, old man hurriedly asked when he heard this.\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi’s expression sank, but he did not reply. Seeing his face, the white-robed, old man ceased speaking. He understood that Xuan Kong Zi’s heart was extremely furious at this moment…\\n\\n The pretty woman and the dark-skinned, old man exchanged glances. They saw a chill in the other party’s eyes.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes were also dark as he stared at the cold smile of Old Mu Gu from a stone platform. His fist was slowly tightened and a fierce glint flashed across his eyes. The mocking laughter of his earlier had aroused the killing intent within his heart.\\n\\n Old Mu Gu ignored the various gazes from all directions. He raised his head and looked at the end of the light pillar in the sky. A dense fog had begun to appear amid the terrifying energy fluctuation. This fog swiftly gathered. Within a short period of time, it had agglomerated into the shape of a thunder cloud.\\n\\n The hearts of everyone present suddenly tightened when the thundercloud was formed in the sky. The appearance of the Pill Lightning this time around would determine the final victor of this Pill Gathering!\\n\\n A thundercloud swiftly churned in front of a countless number of gazes. Green and silver colors appeared almost instantly, dyeing the Pill Lightning with two colors.\\n\\n “It’s already two-colored!”\\n\\n Exclamations sounded one after another in the large stadium when they saw the two-colored Pill Lightning appear in the sky.\\n\\n “It’s not over yet! There’s still another color appearing!”\\n\\n Soon after those cries sounded, the thundercloud churned once again. Immediately, a red color suddenly appeared. Finally, it swiftly expanded in front of the many heated gazes. Within less than one minute, the red color join the two other colors.\\n\\n “It’s three colors! It has reached three colors!”\\n\\n The somewhat quiet atmosphere had once again began to boil when they saw the third color appear. The faces of a countless number of people were so excited to the point that they were a flush red. Within a short day, they had seen three types of three-colored Pill Lightning. This spectacular scene could really be described as one that was rarely seen in a hundred years!\\n\\n Some of the Pill Tower’s Elders on the tall stage felt their hearts become extremely anxious as they watched the three-colored Pill Lightning that had appeared. If Old Mu Gu only produced a three-colored Pill Lightning, there might still be a chance to turn things around. Xiao Yan and Old Qing Hua would have the ability to compete with him…\\n\\n Thunder clouds churned in the distant sky, influencing the hearts of numerous people.\\n\\n “There’s more. There’s more colors appearing!”\\n\\n A hurried scream suddenly resounded over the stadium. Immediately, an uproar resonated over the sky. Countless numbers of gazes hurriedly gathered. They saw that after the third type of color had stabilized, a dazzling golden-colored cloud quietly emitted a ray of golden-colored light like a sun that was hidden in the cloud layer.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n The stadium erupted almost instantly when everyone saw the golden color that had suddenly appeared. Everyone got up from their chairs at this moment. Their eyes were shocked as they looked at the beautiful thunder cloud in the sky. Green, silver, red, and golden. These four different lights in the clouds had set off the thundercloud until it appeared extremely beautiful…\\n\\n Four colors!\\n\\n Four-colored Pill Lightning!\\n\\n The Pill Gathering had finally revealed the best scene at the very last moment of the Pill Gathering!\\n\\n Some of the Elders of the Pill Tower on the tall stage looked at the four-colored Pill Lightning in the sky. Their expressions had become much paler. They looked at each other, but they did not know what to say. For a moment, this entire place had been suppressed by a silence. The Pill Tower’s reputation would definitely end up suffering a great blow if the matter today spread!\\n\\n “Creak…”\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi’s face was so dark and solemn that it was terrifying. It vaguely revealed a savage expression. His dry shriveled fist was clenched until it emitted a cracking sound. The space around him had also formed numerous intense ripples following the fluctuation of his emotion.\\n\\n “Calm down!”\\n\\n The dark-skinned, old man’s expression changed when he saw felt the ripples. His hand heavily landed on Xuan Kong Zi’s shoulder as he cried out in a low voice.\\n\\n The ferocious expression on Xuan Kong Zi’s face was slowly reduced after this low cry rang out. However, his face was still dark and gloomy. A moment later, he finally spoke in a hoarse voice, “I will personally intervene after this matter is over and tear this old bastard into a thousand pieces!”\\n\\n “If you were to attack, it would end up stirring a massive battle between the Pill Tower and the Hall of Souls. The implication is too great. That person from the Hall of Souls is too strong. Back then, the three of us together were no match for him. The Pill Tower will be at a disadvantage if we go to war.” The pretty woman by the side spoke with a serious face.\\n\\n Xuan Kong Zi’s body slightly trembled. His eyes were filled with a frightening fury. It was the first time in so many years that he had found it so difficult to control his emotions.\\n\\n “Let’s just wait and see. Perhaps a miracle will occur…”\\n\\n The pretty woman softly sighed. However, she was also aware that this matter had basically reached a foregone conclusion. Old Mu Gu’s four-colored Pill Lightning had firmly suppressed the three-colored Pill Lightning of old demon Qing Hua and Xiao Yan.\\n\\n “Ha ha!”\\n\\n Old Mu Gu looked at the sky, which had ceased churning, from his stone platform. It had stabilized into a four-colored Pill Lightning. He completely relaxed his tensed heart. A rampant and pleased laugh resounded continuously over the competition grounds.\\n\\n “Ha ha, Xuan Kong Zi, do you see it? The old me has said that the champion spot of the Pill Gathering would definitely land in the hands of us, the Hall of Souls!”\\n\\n Old Mu Gu’s rampant laughter had just sounded when it appeared as though he had thrown a powerful bomb out, causing many people to be at a loss.\\n\\n “Hall of Souls? This person is someone from the Hall of Souls?”\\n\\n “The greatest glory of the Pill Tower will be snatched away by the Hall of Souls, who are completely incompatible with them. Ugh…”\\n\\n “This time around, the Hall of Souls has viciously stepped on the Pill Tower. After this matter, it is likely that the position of the Pill Tower in the hearts of some alchemists will be shaken…”\\n\\n The many alchemists of the Pill Tower revealed unusually ugly expressions upon hearing the many private conversations in the stadium. However, they were speechless at this moment. All they could do was hold their anger in their hearts…\\n\\n On the stone platforms, Cao Ying and Dan Chen were glaring at Old Mu Gu, who was laughing wildly at the sky. They were also members of the Pill Tower. Old Mu Gu’s actions could be considered a violent slap to their faces.\\n\\n They might be furious, but they were without any tactics. Under the rumbling four-colored Pill Lightning in the sky, Old Mu Gu had sufficient strength to willfully step on the reputation of the Pill Tower.\\n\\n Cao Ying’s pretty eyes suddenly turned to another stone platform in an involuntary manner while she remained furious. Xiao Yan was located at that spot. Currently, his face was filled with an expression of hesitation, as though he was pondering something.\\n\\n Cao Ying’s heart leaped when she saw his face. An extremely tiny amount of hope suddenly surged from deep within her heart without reason. After which, she shouted at Xiao Yan!\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, if you are a man, you will go all out!”\\n\\n This sudden cry had resounded over the sky in an extremely abrupt manner. After which, a countless number of eyes gathered on the skinny figure on the stone platform, emitting ‘swoosh’ sounds.\\n\\n Xiao Yan was similarly stunned by this scene. He was surprised as he looked at Cao Ying in the distance, whose face had turned bright-red after she had fully awakened.\\n\\n “Tsk tsk, go all out? At this moment, forget about the younger generation, even if that old bastard Yao Chen were to come, the old me would not even view him seriously!”\\n\\n Old Mu Gu was also startled when he heard her words. He immediately could not help but mock her.\\n\\n Old Mu Gu’s heart suddenly pounded after his laughter had just sounded. His gaze turned to Xiao Yan, only to see Xiao Yan’s expression completely turn gloomy.\\n\\n “You still do not have the qualification for teacher to personally deal with you!”\\n\\n After his dense, cold voice sounded, Xiao Yan suddenly stepped forward. His hands were inserted into the light pillar. He had finally decided to stake it all!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1187","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
