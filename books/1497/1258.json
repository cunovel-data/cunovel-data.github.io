Within an instant, it had caused the interior of the main hall to boil like a pot of oil.\\n\\n Chi chi!\\n\\n The light cluster disappeared. Ten different coloured rays of light surged out from within. Through the light, it was possible for one to vaguely see the scroll objects within it. An ancient aura spread out from within these scrolls. This caused the eyes of quite a number of experts to become bloody red at this moment. Their breathing had also suddenly become heavier.\\n\\n “A Tian class Dou Skill is about to be born!”\\n\\n After the light surged, the large hall remained silent for a short blink of an eye before a sharp cry suddenly resounded over the place. Immediately, one could hear a rumbling sound appearing. Waves after waves of powerful dense Dou Qi erupted within the large hall. Numerous figures became like locust as they transformed into rays of light that rushed towards the light scrolls without due care of their lives.\\n\\n Faced with the blockage of many experts, those ten rays of light appeared to possess their own intelligence. They were actually able to turn on their own while they flew, dodging those large hands that were rushing over.\\n\\n “Grug!”\\n\\n Human figures crossed each other from all directions in the midair. The sound of people exchanging blows continued to be emitted from the midair. Soon after, numerous figures fell after spitting out blood. Finally, they smashed heavily onto the large hall. The low and deep muffled sound caused the hearts of quite a number of people to jump. These fellows were all using lethal blows.\\n\\n “Do not attack first!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression was also unusually grave as he watched this situation that was beyond control. He stopped Zi Yan, who was about to move and spoke in a deep voice.\\n\\n Tang Zhen by the side also nodded slightly. He halted the experts from the Burning Flame Valley and stared intently at the many experts in the midair, who were intercepting the rays of light that were shuttling all over the place. He softly said, “Young friend Xiao Yan. are you currently able to see which of the scroll is the Tian class Dou Skill?”\\n\\n “No. These ten scrolls are all extraordinary items. They can even be said to be the highest class Dou Skills or Qi Method that I have seen during all these years. Someone had clearly did something to these scrolls. It is not easy to catch them with one’s hands.” Xiao Yan shook his head. From his senses, these ten ray of lights all contained an extremely powerful unusual energy. This was something that he had never seen. It was likely that the class of these Dou Skills or Qi Methods were quite high. According to Xiao Yan’s guess, it was likely that amongst the Dou Skill that he had learnt, only the God Seal Skill could compare with them. Clearly, the class of these Dou Skills will definitely not be weaker than the God Seal Skill.\\n\\n “It is indeed worthy of being the remains left by an elite Dou Sheng. Such powerful Dou Skills and Qi Methods are things that even some powerful factions do not possess. However, they have appeared in such large numbers here.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes swept all around the place amidst the chaos. He discovered some of the true experts, the Hall of Souls, Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe and some other factions did not immediately act and snatch the scrolls. Clearly, all of them wanted to wait for these people to fight until all of them were injured before acting.\\n\\n “Ha ha, young friend Xiao Yan, we will act individually later on and see if we can obtain a scroll. Since we have come to this ancient remains, we must naturally not leave empty handed, no?” Tang Zhen looked at the human figures that continuously spat out blood and fall onto the ground as he laughed.\\n\\n Xiao Yan smiled. The Tian class Dou Skill did indeed possess a great allure towards him. He would naturally not give up if he had the opportunity to obtain it.\\n\\n “Ah!”\\n\\n Just as Xiao Yan had nodded, a sharp miserable scream suddenly sounded within the large hall. The eyes of everyone hurriedly looked over. Their expressions suddenly changed. They could see that those stone statue puppets around the stone chair had actually been completely awakened at this moment. Waves after waves of unusually dense murderous aura spread out…\\n\\n These puppets began to kill those around them once they awakened. All of these puppets had the strength of the Dou Zun class. The aura formed when they attacked together was extremely shocking. Within a short instant, the area within a hundred metres from the stone chair was being dyed by the bright red fresh blood. A rich bloody scent spread apart, causing one’s heart to be quite shocked.\\n\\n “The puppets have been awakened.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan knitted his brows tightly when he saw this situation. All of these puppets had the strength of the Dou Zun class. Currently, all of them had engage in a slaughter. They were just like tigers leaping into a herd of goats. Other than some large factions, there were basically no one who could contend against their strength. Usually, they would only exchange two to three blows before the experts would be forcefully torn apart by these puppets.\\n\\n “These are not ordinary puppets. There are still some lifeforce remaining within their eyes…” Xiao Yan looked at a puppet nearest to him, which was engaging in a wild slaughter. His eyes suddenly swept towards the latter’s eyes. That spot did not possess an empty hole like other puppets. Instead, a kind of extremely wild killing desire was burning there.\\n\\n “This is an ancient human puppet. It uses a special method to extract the soul of an expert from his body and seal it within the body of a puppet. In this way, the puppet that is created will not only possess some consciousness but will even be able to use Dou Skills. They are far more troublesome to deal with compared to ordinary puppets.” Tian Huo zun-zhe also spoke with a solemn face.\\n\\n Xiao Yan involuntarily inhaled a gentle breath of air when he heard this. This elite Dou Sheng really had quite vicious tactics. If one put it this way, would it not mean that he would have to at least kill a dozen over elite Dou Zuns in order to create these puppets?\\n\\n The originally chaotic situation within the spacious large hall had become even more chaotic because of the participation of these puppets that were wildly slaughtering everyone. At this moment, those experts, who originally wanted to gain from the effort of others could no longer simple watch idly by the side. This was because these powerful puppets that only knew how to kill had already included them in the offensive range.\\n\\n “I will act first in awhile and see if I can snatch a scroll. All of you should not act. We cannot be greedy. Otherwise, we will only end up inviting fire and burn ourselves.” Xiao Yan glanced at the chaotic large hall. Everyone had lost their reasoning amidst the ten scrolls dancing in the air. Their eyes were red as they continued to give chase. Anyone who approach a scroll first would be surrounded almost immediately be the people behind. Dou Qi spluttered out and the person who had obtained the scroll did not even have the time to emit a miserable cry before he was directly blasted into a cluster of dripping blood.\\n\\n “Understood.”\\n\\n Everyone nodded when they heard the low cry of Xiao Yan. If they obtained too many scrolls, they would definitely attract countless number of red eyes. At such a moment, no one would bother about the gap in strength. The allure of the Tian class Dou Skill was already sufficient to turn them crazy.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n Everyone’s reply had just sounded when over a dozen figures in front were suddenly blasted into a cluster of bloody fog. A gray figure rushed out with lightning like speed from within the blood fog. A long spear that was dripping with fresh blood pierced explosively towards Xiao Yan’s group while being accompanied by an incomparably sharp wind.\\n\\n “Be careful. It is a human puppet!”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor’s expression changed slightly as she looked at the gray figure that had rushed over. Her body flashed and she appeared in front of Xiao Yan. After which, she directly rushed forward and blocked that human puppet. Vast and mighty Dou Qi surged out from her body with a beautiful outline in all directions.\\n\\n During the time that Little Fairy Doctor had blocked this human puppet, Xiao Yan had taken the opportunity to quickly weigh the latter. Now that he was a short distance away, he was finally able to see that the surface of these puppets appeared to be covered by a layer of grayish-white mysterious cloth. This cloth was flickering with an unusually luster. On top of being soft, it also possessed quite a powerful defensive strength. Even a full force attack by an elite Dou Zong would not be able to tear this kind of mysterious cloth.\\n\\n “Try and see if you can control these puppets.” Tian Huo zun-zhe spoke in a deep voice.\\n\\n Xiao Yan swiftly nodded upon hearing this. While the human puppet was being pestered by Little Fairy Doctor, a Spiritual Strength swiftly surged out from between Xiao Yan’s brows. After which, it entered the puppet’s body with lightning like speed. However, Xiao Yan was not as lucky as the last time. He could sense an incomparably powerful seal located at the spot in the puppet where the seal was planted. This kind of seal was definitely personally left behind by that elite Dou Sheng. Therefore, it had enabled these human puppets to still carry out the order he had placed meticulously even after countless number of years.\\n\\n “I am unable to control them. The seal is too strong. The current me is unable to remove it.” Xiao Yan withdrew his Spiritual Strength and shook his head. He felt a little regretful. If he was able to subdue these human puppets, there would no longer be anyone within this large hall who had the qualification to fight against him. Unfortunately…\\n\\n Tian Huo zun-zhe and the rest were a little disappointed but they came to an understanding after thinking about it. These human puppets were the last defence of the elite Dou Sheng. It would be too incredulous if they were so easily controlled.\\n\\n “We should also prepare to act. I will be responsible to snatch the scroll. All of you should help me block the other experts.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan glanced at Little Fairy Doctor’s situation That human puppet was quite troublesome. It was clearly very difficult to finish it off within a short period of time. Fortunately, Little Fairy Doctor was not in any danger. Hence, Xiao Yan had placed his attention towards the midair once again. At this moment, Feng Qing Er, the Ice River Valley and the other factions were unable to wait any longer. All of them had joined in the snatching of the scrolls.\\n\\n Feng Huo zun-zhe and the rest nodded upon hearing this. The Dou Qi within their bodies were circulated rapidly. They were aware that it was not an easy task to successfully obtain the scrolls in this chaotic situation.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over the midair before pausing on a red ray of light. The ray of light already had quite a number of blood traces over it. Base on Xiao Yan’s guess, it was likely that over ten experts had already died because of it.\\n\\n “That will be the target…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan muttered to himself in his heart. This scroll was completely bright red and there was a wild and violent aura spreading from it. It was likely that it was related to the fire affinity and was most suitable for Xiao Yan. Moreover, compared with the other scrolls, there were fewer experts after it. The level of difficulty in snatching it would correspondingly be reduced.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes shifted along with the flashing bright red ray of light. A moment later, this ray of light had finally appeared in the area around Xiao Yan’s group after being blocked by many experts.\\n\\n “Do it!”\\n\\n A sharp cry was suddenly emitted from Xiao Yan’s mouth when that ray of light entered the area around Xiao Yan’s group!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1258","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
