It was likely that it would take over ten days for one to hurry from this place to the Flower Sect. From the looks of it, it seemed that he was a little pressed for time. “Is that sect chief the only one in the Flower Sect who oppose Yun Yun? What about the other experts? The Flower Sect can be considered a big faction with a long inheritance. The sect definitely possess quite a strong foundation. If the entire Flower Sect cannot accept Yun Yun, it is likely that the other party will not take it lying down even if this trouble is settled unless one leave this sect.” “The Flower Sect does indeed possess quite a strong foundation. However, most of the true experts from the older generations spend their time in continuous retreat. If these older generations experts are still in the sect, that woman would not be the one becoming the acting sect chief. As for the other Elders, most of them are loyal to Granny Hua. They will naturally not have any objections to Granny Hua testaments. The only problem is that woman…” Nalan Yanran explained. “This is the case huh…” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His expression warmed a little. If that woman is the only one who oppose, it would be easily to resolve the matter. “Just go if you wish to…” An elderly voice was suddenly transmitted over when Xiao Yan was in deep thought. Yao Lao’s figure had appeared on a chair beside him at some unknown time and spoke smilingly towards him. “Teacher?” Xiao Yan was startled when he saw this. Immediately, he nodded. This matter was related to Yun Yun. He would naturally be unable to shrink for it. Regardless of what the case was, he must make a trip to this Flower Sect. Nalan Yanran by the side became restrained when she saw Yao Lao. The current her was already aware of the reputation and status that Yao Lao possessed in the Central Plains. It was only natural for her to feel a little uneasy in front of such a big shot. “Ugh, it is unexpected that even that old woman Hua Yu has reached her limit…” Yao Lao glanced at Nalan Yanran before sighing quietly and said. Xiao Yan was startled upon hearing Yao Lao’s sigh. Immediately, he understood that this so called old woman Hua Yu was the mysterious Granny Hua that Nalan Yanran spoke of. Immediately, he asked in a surprised manner, “Does teacher know her?” “This old woman became famous on the Central Plains much earlier than me. She could also be considered an extremely exciting and great person. Back then, I had the opportunity to meet her a couple of times. She is haughty and possess many opponents. As for her crippled legs, it should be something that have happened after my incident. It is likely that she has suffered an extremely serious injury. Otherwise, her end would not come so quickly…” Yao Lao nodded. Immediately, he smilingly said, “However, that Yun Yun is also considered quite fortunate. She is actually able to obtain the inheritance from this old woman. This old woman has never accepted any disciples all her life. Her character is eccentric and does not trust anyone easily. However, that Yun Yun is able to obtain her trust. It must be said that she is a determined and blessed person.” “The Flower Sect possess many experts. That acting chief is not a cause for concern. With your current strength, it is not difficult to deal with her. The one who is a little more troublesome to deal with his her male companion Yaohua Liangjun. However, I think that you should be able to deal with it…” Yao Lao smiled. He flicked his finger and a cream white jade tablet flew towards Xiao Yan. “This is a spatial jade tablet that I have created. Should you meet with a situation that you cannot handle, you can shatter it. I will hurry over as fast as I can. Some of those old fellows from the Flower Sect owns me a favor from back then. Once you say my name, it is likely that they will not make things difficult for you.” Xiao Yan immediately sensed the vast and mighty spatial strength within the jade tablet when he received it. A surprise flashed across his eyes as he nodded towards Yao Lao. “Qing Lin and I shall head over this time around. Tian Huo zun-zhe and Little Fairy Doctor are all undertaking a retreat and training. It is not nice to disturb them…” Xiao Yan hesitated before speaking. In any case, with his current strength, he would be able to successfully escape even when meeting a seven star Dou Zun expert. Moreover, Qing Lin might only possess the strength of a one star Dou Zun but after summoning the Ancient Heaven Serpent spirit, she possess a great strength that could fight against a six star elite Dou Zun. “Aye. it is better for Tian Huo zun-zhe to remain here. I am thinking of a way to allow him to regain his peak strength. Although you have helped Little Fairy Doctor refine a poison pill, her the true strength of Little Fairy Doctor’s Woeful Poison Body has also yet to be completely unleashed. I will aid her during this period of them. The next time you return, it is likely that you will see the strength of these two soaring…” Yao Lao smilingly said. “That is good.” Xiao Yan also spoke joyously. With Yao Lao acting personally, it should not be difficult for Tian Huo zun-zhe to regain his peak strength. On the matter of how to unleash most of the Woeful Poison Body’s strength, Xiao Yan would naturally be unable to compare with the incredibly experienced Yao Lao. “If it is possible, help Yun Yun become the chief of the Flower Sect during this trip of yours there. The Flower Sect is extremely powerful. If she is able to become the chief, the Falling Star Pavilion will also gain another reliable ally.” Xiao Yan’s voice had just sounded when a weak ant like voice suddenly sounded beside his ear. His eyes were lifted, only to see Yao Lao moving his lips. Immediately, he nodded with a bitter smile. Ever since the Misty Cloud Sect was forcefully disband by him back then, Yun Yun had been resistant towards something like being the chief of a sect. Who could tell whether she will be willing to become the chief of the Flower Sect. “Ugh, all of you should also get moving. There is not much time left…” After seeing Xiao Yan nodding Yao Lao smiled, waved his hand and said. “Understood.” Xiao Yan nodded. He turned around and walked out of the hall. Nalan Yanran behind bowed respectfully to Yao Lao before hurriedly followed. After leaving the hall, Xiao Yan looked for Qing Lin. Subsequently, he ceased remaining any longer as he got Nalan Yanran to lead the way. The three of them hurried to the Flower Sect without stopping. The Flower Sect was located towards the western region of the Central Plains. There was quite a distance between it and the Falling Star Pavilion. Even with the speed of Xiao Yan trio, it was likely that they would need over ten days to reach it. Fortunately, Qing Lin had summoned an expert from the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe after having left the Falling Star Pavilion. Finally, she ordered him to transform into his actual body. The three of them rode on it. Only then did they avoid the bitterness from rushing about. An enormous black body shuttled through the clouds in the distant sky. When the enormous body twitched, a wave of low and deep rushing wind sound would appear. Xiao Yan sat on the back of the snake. Although the body of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python was covered with icy cold slippery scales, his body did not even move a little. Wild wind rushed past his ear but his hair did not even make the slightest movement. At this moment, Xiao Yan had his eyes tightly shut. His mind had sunk deep into his brows. The Bone Chilling Flame was slowly emitting an unusual temperature at that spot. It was different from the other flames. This kind of flame would give one an extremely icy cold feeling. However, within this icy chillness hid a wild and violent hot energy. These two opposing energy merged perfectly together, causing one to involuntarily praise the mysteriousness of this world. Xiao Yan’s brows was where his Spiritual Strength lingered. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan had already planted a spiritual imprint into the current Bone Chilling Flame. Hence, the mysterious temperature did not bring about any discomfort to Xiao Yan’s soul. Instead, it caused his spiritual fluctuation to become increasingly lively. The Bone Chilling Flame burned fiercely. That white fire seal between Xiao Yan’s brows was also emitting a slight light. At this moment, he was continuously and slowly merging his Spiritual Strength into the Bone Chilling Flame. This Heavenly Flame had been refined by Yao Lao for many years. Even though Yao Lao had already removed his spiritual imprint, the flame still had some vague resistance towards other souls. What Xiao Yan needed to do was to gradually allow the Bone Chilling Flame to get use to him, his new owner and resolve the resistance. Originally, this should be a process that exhaust a great amount of time. However, one the first attempt by Xiao Yan to strengthen the familiarity between the two, he suddenly discovered that the Bone Chilling Flame’s acceptance towards him had far exceeded his expectation. On top of causing him to be surprised, it also gave him great joy. Xiao Yan only needed to think for a moment before understanding this kind of transformation. When Yao Lao was captured back then, he had sealed the Bone Chilling Flame within Xiao Yan’s body. The latter had also gained control over it. After being together for all these years, Xiao Yan could actually also be considered the second owner of the Bone Chilling Flame. Currently this second owner was advancing to become the main owner. The familiarity between the two would naturally soar swiftly. According to this speed, Xiao Yan guessed that he would be able to use the Flame Mantra to refine the Bone Chilling Flame very soon. This kind of speed… perhaps even Yao Lao would not have expected it. During the subsequent journey, Xiao Yan would basically focus his mind and allow his soul to merge with the Bone Chilling Flame. Under this endurance and hard work of his, the resistance within the Bone Chilling Flame swiftly became weaker with each day. Xiao Yan shut his eyes and sunk his mind into his body on the enormous snake back. Even his breathing had become much weaker. The fire seal between his brows slowly emitted a faint glow while he breath. Nalan Yanran and Qing Lin by the side turned their eyes away after glancing at this situation of his. They had basically already gotten used to this act of Xiao Yan during this period of time. “Puff!” When these two people turned their eyes away, Xiao Yan’s tightly shut eyes trembled slightly. The fire seal between his brows suddenly emitted a glaring fire glow. In the next instant, the fire seal appeared to have been revived. It slowly wiggled and actually seeped into Xiao Yan’s skin. Finally, it disappeared. This sudden unexpected change had also caused Nalan Yanran and Qing Lin to be startled. Before they could speak, Xiao Yan’s tightly shut eyes were slowly opened. His dark black eyes currently had a dense white flame burning within it! At this moment, the resistance within the Bone Chilling Flame had actually been completely refined and removed by Xiao Yan!
