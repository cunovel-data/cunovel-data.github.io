Numerous gazes that faintly carried some shock were shot in the direction the voice had originated.\n The roar had naturally reached the Sky Stone Stage. Immediately, everyone emitted waves after waves of exclamations. Their gazes followed the direction the voice had originated in before finally pausing above the Hong clan household.\n “It is actually Hong Tian Xiao. Unexpectedly, he has also been stirred this time around!”\n “That Xiao Yan is likely going to be unlucky this time around. That Hong Tian Xiao is rumored to be a five star Dou Zong. His strength is even greater than Chen Yun from the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Although Xiao Yan has the help of the puppet, he will definitely be unable to resist the attacks of two elite Dou Zongs.”\n Xiao Yan ignored the private conversations around him. His fist tightened slightly. If the Little Fairy Doctor had been here or if Tian Huo zun-zhe was awake, he would not need to be afraid of the ancestor of the Hong clan. Unfortunately, one of his two great helpers had been separated from him while the other was in slumber. Xiao Yan really had difficulty defeating two elite Dou Zongs by just relying on the Earth Demon Puppet unless he used the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame that was formed from three ‘Heavenly Flames.’ However, if he did that, he would definitely be weakened. This place was the territory of the Hong clan. Moreover, there was the existence of the Wind Lightning Pavilion five hundred kilometers away. It was clear that it would be disadvantageous for him if he got too entangled in this place.\n “Looks like I can only withdraw first today…” This thought flashed through Xiao Yan’s heart. His gaze swiftly turned to the Earth Demon Puppet, who was fighting an intense battle with Hong Yun. His brows were involuntarily knit together. That old fellow Chen Yun seemed to have already become aware of his intention. At this moment, he had suddenly gone all out to pester the Earth Demon Puppet, attempting to prevent it from being taken by Xiao Yan.\n “You’re seeking death!”\n Xiao Yan’s eyes became chilly when he saw the actions of Chen Yun. Aware of the sudden surge in killing intent within Xiao Yan’s heart, the body of the Earth Demon Puppet suddenly unleashed a glaring silver-colored glow. Its attacking speed suddenly increased as both its hands were like hammers which violently smashed toward Chen Yun, unleashing a frightening force.\n Chen Yun’s expression also changed slightly upon sensing the sudden increase in the Earth Demon Puppet’s speed. He hurriedly maneuvered all the Dou Qi within his body. Despite this, his body trembled each time it collided with the Earth Demon Puppet. A numb feeling was being transmitted from his arm.\n “Dammit. Just what is this puppet made off? Its physical strength is actually this terrifying!” Chen Yun’s heart involuntarily felt some shock as he sensed the pain that was transmitted from his arm.\n “Xiao Yan, leave quickly. Don’t delay any longer. It will be too late if you delay any longer!”\n Han Chi’s anxious voice was quietly transmitted over when Xiao Yan was controlling the Earth Demon Puppet, making it increase its attacking speed.\n Xiao Yan merely shook his head when he heard Han Chi’s reminder. He sensed that he had been locked onto by an aura that was filled with killing intent. Even if he were to turn around and leave now, the other party would swiftly catch up with him.\n A glow flickered in Xiao Yan’s eyes as his hand suddenly grabbed toward the enormous pit. A suction force surged and pulled Hong Li’s body from it. Xiao Yan grabbed his body and observed him. Immediately, Xiao Yan let out a cold laugh and said, “You really have quite a strong life. I am unable to kill you even after all this. But, it’s just as well…”\n The eyelids of the unconscious Hong Li twitched upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words. He wanted to open his eyes, but his serious injuries caused him to simply give up after a futile attempt.\n The sharp sound of rushing wind resounded over the sky after Xiao Yan had grabbed Hong Li. Immediately, a vague figure wildly shot toward the Sky Stone Stage in a lightning-like manner. The dark and dense killing intent that spread out of the figure could be sensed despite the great distance apart.\n “Brat, put Hong Li down. Otherwise, you’ll die!”\n That human figure saw the person whom Xiao Yan was grabbing with his hands from a great distance. Immediately, a furious roar was once again transmitted over.\n Chen Yun, who was bitterly enduring, felt a joy in his heart upon hearing this roar. His peripheral sight glanced over and did indeed see Hong Tian Xiao’s figure. He hurriedly cried out, “Old fellow Hong, the people from your Hong clan have all died to this brat’s hand. Quickly kill him!”\n “Bang!”\n A silver glow suddenly broke Chen Yun’s blockade when those words had just left his mouth and a fist violently smashed into his arm. Chen Yun let out a moan under this great strength landed. A thread of fresh blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.\n “Chen Yun?”\n The light figure that had hurried over paused upon hearing Chen Yun’s cry, revealing a red-clothed, yellow-faced, old man. He knit his brows and looked at the Earth Demon Puppet which was pestering Chen Yun. A solemness also appeared in his eyes. With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell that Chen Yun was being suppressed and defeated by the puppet.\n “What are you looking for? This puppet is something that belongs to that brat. Once you restrain him, the puppet will naturally stop. Quickly attack. Don’t let that brat escape! Otherwise, the members of your Hong clan would have died for no reason!”\n Chen Yun furiously cried out while Hong Tian Xiao was startled by the Earth Demon Puppet.\n Hong Tian Xiao’s sinister gaze slowly paused on Xiao Yan in the sky upon hearing Chen Yun’s cry. He said in a dense manner, “Brat, obediently release Hong Li. The old me will let you have a quick death!”\n Xiao Yan was expressionless. His gaze glanced at Chen Yun, who was being suppressed by the Earth Demon Puppet’s attacks. From the looks of it, the puppet might be able to kill this old fellow if there was a little more time. Moreover, even if it was unable to truly kill him, it would definitely turn him into a seriously injured state!\n Xiao Yan wanted to delay some time but Hong Tian Xiao would not give him the opportunity to do so. He had naturally been able to tell that Chen Yun would not be able to endure for long under the powerful puppet.\n “Regardless of who your elders are, the old me will definitely not allow you to leave in one piece after you have killed so many people from my Hong clan!” Hong Tian Xiao sinisterly spoke. His body shook and it transformed into a light figure that rushed toward Xiao Yan. That stern killing intent caused a chillness to appear on the skin of quite a number of people.\n Xiao Yan’s eyes stared intently at Hong Tian Xiao, who had rushed over, before he suddenly let out a cold smile. His palm pressed on Hong Li’s chest while grabbing his shoulders. After which, he used all his strength to violently toss Hong Li in a manner similar to throwing shot put.\n “Old fellow, I have hid a hidden force within Hong Li’s body. If you do not catch up to him and resolve it, he will definitely die once the hidden force explodes!” Xiao Yan laughed out loud after throwing Hong Li aside.\n Chi!\n The light figure that was wildly charging at Xiao Yan suddenly paused. Hong Tian Xiao gaze hesitated for a moment before he let out a furious roar. He turned around and swiftly gave chase in the direction Hong Li had been thrown. Although his body had moved, another roar, that was filled with killing intent, was transmitted into Xiao Yan’s ears.\n “Brat, I will use the name of the ancestor of the Hong clan to swear that I will break all the bones in your body one at a time and let you taste what it’s like being able to neither live nor die!”\n Xiao Yan completely ignored Hong Tian Xiao’s vicious roar. He had really heard too many similar threats. However, no one had managed to realize them even today.\n Hong Tian Xiao had just turned around when Xiao Yan’s sinister gaze suddenly shot toward Chen Yun. The corner of his mouth was lifted into a dark and cold arc as his hand seals suddenly flew. Powerful Dou Qi was swiftly agglomerated.\n Chen Yun’s heart suddenly sank when he sensed Xiao Yan’s actions. He was already barely able to face the Earth Demon Puppet’s attack. If Xiao Yan were to join in at this moment, it was likely that his fate would be a terrible one.\n “This old bastard, so what if that fellow dies? He is just a trash, what need is there to rescue him?” Chen Yun could only furiously curse Hong Tian Xiao in his heart while he panicked. He had similarly not expect that in the face of two elite Dou Zong revealing themselves, Xiao Yan did not choose to immediately flee. Instead, he had diverted one of them away and focused his strength on dealing with the other. This kind of all out tactic was a crazy one!\n “Bang!”\n Another punch with frightening strength was violently sent flying over, and scattered the majestic Dou Qi in front of Chen Yun, shaking him until he continued to step back.\n A feeling of danger rose within Chen Yun’s heart as his footsteps hurried back. The corner of his eyes drifted and one could only see a vague figure appearing behind him. A palm-sized crystal energy handprint had quietly appeared where the figure’s hand was located. The energy that was contained in it caused Chen Yun’s face to change.\n “Sea Flipping Seal!”\n Xiao Yan cried out furiously in his heart. The hand seal was swung out in a lightning-like manner, and struck at a fatal point on Chen Yun’s back.\n Chen Yun’s face became exceptionally ugly as he sensed the attack that came from behind him. If this had occurred at a normal time, it was definitely not difficult for him to dodge. However, at this moment, the Earth Demon Puppet’s fist wind had sealed off the space around him. He was unable to use his agility Dou Skills. All he could do was clench his teeth and swiftly turn around. A majestic waterfall like Dou Qi shot out from both his hands.\n “Bang!”\n The majestic Dou Qi and the Seal Flipping Seal fiercely collided. Xiao Yan’s body shook and he hurriedly withdrew over a dozen steps. On the other hand, Chen Yun merely withdrew one step. However, his already pale face grew even paler.\n “Chi!”\n Chen Yun had yet to have the time to relax after having taken a step back when a wild and violent strength, that caused his expression to change, appeared in a lightning-like manner behind him. After which, it ruthlessly struck his shoulders.\n “Grug!”\n Chen Yun was finally unable to endure any longer after suffering this heavy blow. A mouthful of fresh red blood was spat out. His body rubbed against the ground, forming a scar that was dozens of meters long.\n The Earth Demon Puppet continued to rush over after Chen Yun’s body had just withdrawn. It grabbed Chen Yun’s arm and broke the finger he wore his Storage Ring on in front of a countless number of shocked gazes.\n The Earth Demon Puppet held the broken finger tightly and ceased launching any attacks. Instead, it swiftly rushed to where Xiao Yan was located. Finally, Xiao Yan stored it into his Storage Ring with a wave of his hand. The Storage Ring that was removed from Chen Yun’s finger also fell into his hand.\n “Ha ha, thank you for your gift Elder Chen!”\n Xiao Yan held the Storage Ring and laughed out loud. His gaze glanced at the northern sky. There was a furious aura wildly hurrying over from that direction.\n “Have you discovered something missing…”\n A cold laugh sounded as Xiao Yan swiftly spread the bone wings behind him. With a flap of the bone wings, he rose into the sky, and left.\n “Little bastard, my Wind Lightning Pavilion will not cease chasing you until you die!”\n Chen Yun forcefully endured the intense pain that was transmitted from his finger. Both of his eyes were blood-red as his teeth violently bit the tip of his tongue. Some essence blood was spat out. The blood had a faint lightning glow lingering within it. With a vicious glance at Xiao Yan, he waved his hand and the essence blood lightning glow was divided into two. One of them penetrated shot toward Xiao Yan while the other flew toward the southern sky.\n The essence blood that came flashing over shocked Xiao Yan. He extended his wings and his body rose to the sky in a lightning-like manner. However, the essence blood lightning glow was unusually fast. With a flash, it shot into Xiao Yan’s body.\n The essence blood lightning glow did not do anything to cause the slightest discomfort to Xiao Yan when it entered his body. He frowned a little while the vicious voice of Chen Yun was once again transmitted over.\n “You have been hit with the blood lightning seal of my Wind Lightning Pavilion. My Wind Lightning Pavilion will be able to find you no matter where you run off. Little bastard, I want to see just where you can hide!”\n “I will accompany you until the end!”\n Xiao Yan laughed coldly upon hearing Chen Yun’s words. His gaze paused for an instant on the members of the Han clan. After which, he flapped his bone wings, and transformed into a light figure, that swiftly fled to the sky above Tian Bei City, before disappearing in the blink of an eye…\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-969","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
