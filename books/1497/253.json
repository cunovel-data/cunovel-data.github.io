He could not help but shake his head. This Mo clan was really worthy of being called the strongest clan in the eastern region of the Jia Ma Empire. Just this tightly secured fortress would have required an unknown amount of wealth to build.\\n\\n On the towering walls, there were guards defending every ten meters. In some of the gaps, Xiao Yan was able to barely see sharp arrow blades flickering with a thick cold glow under the sunlight.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Perception vaguely swept across the top of the fortress. He could sense that in the air above the fortress, there were over ten sight blockades placed without any blind spots. Anyone who wanted to enter from the sky would likely be immediately shot by the countless of arrows hidden in the dark areas until one became a prickling porcupine.\\n\\n “Tsk tsk, this defence is really tight. Looks like it would be somewhat troublesome to enter without anyone noticing.” Hai Bo Dong’s gaze swept across the fortress and said in a somewhat surprised manner.\\n\\n “It is indeed a little troublesome.” Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. Perhaps it was because today was Mo Cheng birthday, but the defensive strength of the fortress was definitely strengthened by a couple of times. With this kind of airtight defence, Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong would have some difficulty sneaking in without being noticed.\\n\\n “Why don’t I go and get hold of two invitation cards?” Hai Bo Dong said with a frown.\\n\\n “Ke ke, with our clothes, one look and anyone would know we don’t have any kind intentions. Before they have figured out our identities, they would definitely not let us in.” Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. His gaze paused on the extremely lively and celebratory human flow at the main entrance of the Mo clan’s home. A moment later, he turned towards a small path, waved to Hai Bo Dong and said, “Follow me.”\\n\\n The two of them walked on the small path, took half a circle along the outside of the Mo clan’s home and finally stopped at a quiet spot. This place had very few people walking about because of its remote location. Although there were still patrols placed on the fortress wall, the defense here was undoubtedly much weaker compared to the other side.\\n\\n Standing in the shade of a lush green tree, Xiao Yan lifted his head and quietly watched the cycle of the patrols alternating on the wall. After a long while, the tip of his feet suddenly stepped on the ground and his body turned into a black shadow which shot toward the top of the fortress wall in a lightning like manner. His palm was swiftly waved and the green colored flame shot out from his finger. It swiftly and accurately struck the guards who were criss-crossing each other during their patrol.\\n\\n The hot temperature of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ caused the few guards to be unable to even give a blood curling scream before they were turned into lumps of black colored ashes with a muffled sound.\\n\\n Xiao Yan indifferently glanced at the ashes on the ground. He waved his sleeves gently and a gentle breeze gushed out, sweeping the place until it was completely clean.\\n\\n After Xiao Yan had completed cleaning the site, Hai Bo Dong also quietly swept over. The two of them exchanged glances before they swiftly leaped down from the fortress wall and dodged the patrolling teams that appeared to have not the slightest gap between them. Their bodies turned into two shadows, shuttling through the dark shadows of the buildings.\\n\\n “How do you intend to search? This Moa clan’s home is so huge. If someone was to tell you that there isn’t any hidden rooms, I think that you wouldn’t believe them. If we continue to search one room after another, how many days would it take?” Hai Bo Dong’s body curled in a dark shadow. The Qi all over his body was completely withdrawn at the moment. With the additional help of the cover from the black robe, he was still able to hide himself perfectly even though it was still a bright day out. Seeing this practiced manner, it was clear that he had also done such a thing before in the past. Hai Bo Dong said those words helplessly as he eyed the surrounding packed buildings.\\n\\n “I was once with Qing Lin for a period of time, therefore I am quite familiar with her Qi. Later, I will use my Spiritual Strength to scan the Mo clan. As long as she isn’t deep underground, I should be able to detect her.” Xiao Yan voiced his thoughts.\\n\\n “Spiritual Strength. Although mine is also not weak, but it cannot be compared to you, an alchemist. Therefore, the matter of searching will have to be handled by you.” Hai Bo Dong said.\\n\\n “Ok. Help me pay attention to the surrounding situation.” Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. Xiao Yan’s eyes were closed as Yao Lao’s powerful Spiritual Strength swiftly broke through his body and turned into ripples which swiftly spread in all directions.\\n\\n After the Spiritual Strength spread out, many surrounding images swiftly flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart. However, he did not discover any trace of Qing Lin.\\n\\n Following the increasingly wide region that the Spiritual Strength had spread to, Xiao Yan’s eyebrows were pressed increasingly deep together. A long while later, he could only retrieve his spread out Spiritual Strength without having obtained any result. After which, he carefully scanned his surrounding environment.\\n\\n Due to the need for Xiao Yan to search precisely, the scope that Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength could cover had to be narrowed. This caused him to have to move his body whenever it was necessary in order to allow his Spiritual Strength to continue scanning other places.\\n\\n After the search had continued for around half an hour, Xiao Yan finally opened his eyes with a gloomy face.\\n\\n “You didn’t find her?” After seeing Xiao Yan’s expression, Hai Bo Dong knew the answer. However, he still habitually inquired.\\n\\n “This Mo clan should have some hidden rooms that are difficult to discover. Otherwise, it would be impossible for this precise scan of mine to not detect even the slightest trace.” Xiao Yan’s eyes looked through the gap in the wall and eyed the fully armed guards patrolling past outside. He frowned and spoke in a soft voice.\\n\\n Hai Bo Dong touched his somewhat white beard and glanced at Xiao Yan’s expression. He mentioned with some hesitation, “Could it be that those guys in the Mo clan had obtained the thing they needed. That Qing Lin young lady could have been…”\\n\\n The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth hurriedly twisted a few time. He inhaled a deep breath and the little girl’s timid manner that caused people\u0027s hearts to ache in pity once again surfaced in his mind. He parted his mouth and said thickly, “If it’s like this, then I don’t mind washing the Mo clan with blood!”\\n\\n Seeing the cold filled face of Xiao Yan, Hai Bo Dong helplessly shook his head. He could only remain silent and not say anything to provoke him.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s face was gloomy as he leaned against the wall. Being unable to reconcile with the situation, he once again used Yao Lao’s Spiritual Strength to search for one around only to obtain the same result which lacked any news.\\n\\n Eyeing Xiao Yan whose expression became increasingly dark following the deepening of the scan, Hai Bo Dong shook his head. He said, “Forget it. Let’s just take direct action. After we capture that Mo Cheng and beat him half to death, I think that he will tell us.”\\n\\n Hearing this, Xiao Yan let out a gentle breath. The fists in his sleeves were tightly clenched. A long while later, he nodded his head slightly and said in a soft and cold voice, “Just as well. Let’s attack directly.”\\n\\n Once he said the words, Xiao Yan waved his sleeves gently. His toes stepped on the ground and his body was like a large eagle as he easily leaped onto the roof of the buildings. His gaze swept passed his surroundings. After which, he nestled close to the roof of the buildings and quickly rushed towards the largest hall at the center of the fortress. Behind him, Hai Bo Dong’s figure was like a fallen leaf floating in the breeze as he floated closely behind Xiao Yan.\\n\\n Exhibiting their speed to the maximum, Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong’s figure transformed into two vague black lines. In an instant, they had rushed a distance of a hundred meters. The patrolling guards below the buildings could only sense a strange wind suddenly wildly surge over. By the time they raised their heads with vigilance, they did not even notice the figure of a ghost.\\n\\n …...\\n\\n A few human figures were seated in a dark, hidden room.\\n\\n “Mo Ling, how are the preparations of the matter?” On the leader’s seat, a white-haired old man dressed in pale-gray clothes opened his mouth and softly asked.\\n\\n “First Elder, I have already confirmed that the little girl does indeed possess the legendary ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’.” A middle-aged man respectfully replied.\\n\\n “That’s good.” Hearing this, the eyes of the old man brightened. An excitement involuntarily flashed across his face. He laughed sinisterly, “It\u0027s unexpected that our Mo clan would have such good luck this time around. We actually managed to meet a ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’ that has yet to mature.”\\n\\n “First Elder. Is that ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’ really as amazing as what is said in the legend?” The middle-aged man from before asked softly.\\n\\n “Hee hee, it might well be greater. Didn’t you see the huge two-headed snake protecting that little girl? That is a Dou Ling class guarding beast. If it were not because of the ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’, do you think that she could control it with her strength that is not even that of a Dou Zhe?”\\n\\n “As long as we can obtain that pair of eyes and then train it until it reaches its maturity, who in this Jia Ma Empire would dare contend with us? When that time comes, I would even be able to contend with even that Yun Yun. Would we still need to rely on the Misty Cloud Sect? If we could save the tribute that we give to them every year, the speed at which our Mo clan could develop would far exceed what it is now.” The old man’s palm slammed the surface of the table heavily as he said with a face that was filled with unwillingness.\\n\\n When faced with the old man’s furious words, the remaining people dared not interrupt and could only hurriedly nod their heads.\\n\\n “That’s right, is there any report from the people we had sent to the Rock Desert City? Has that ‘Desert Metal Mercenary Company’ been completely cleared up? They had been living with the little girl for such a long time and may have discovered the secret of her eyes. This kind of thing must definitely not be spread around. Therefore, they must die!” The old man suddenly said in a thick voice, seemingly having remembered something.\\n\\n “Uh, not yet. But with Mo Ran’s and the others’ strength, I think it should happen soon.” A person hesitated for a moment before replying.\\n\\n “Relay the information and let them hurry up. After clearing up the ‘Desert Metal Mercenary Company’, it would be best if they also kill off all the ‘Sand Mercenary Company’ without anyone knowing. We cannot leave any loose ends behind.” the old man coldly said.\\n\\n “Yes, sir.”\\n\\n “Ah.” The old man nodded his head slightly. His shriveled hand gently knocked on the table as he suddenly asked, “Have you found out about the background of the two black-robed people whom Mo Li had reported yesterday?”\\n\\n “No, those two people seemed to have suddenly appeared. We do not have even the slightest information about them.” The middle-aged man from before smiled bitterly and answered.\\n\\n “Try to send people to pay attention to them. I keep feeling that there’s something wrong with these two people. After today’s celebration is complete, we will begin transplanting that little girl’s eyes. I’m afraid that something may happen if we wait too long.” The old man frowned as he coldly spoke.\\n\\n “Yes, sir.” The middle-aged man respectfully said. He hesitated a little before saying, “First Elder, Nalan Yanran has also come to Yan city.”\\n\\n “Yes, I know.” The old man nodded his head. A glow flashed across his meticulous old eyes and he said, “Let Mo Li spend more effort on Nalan Yanran. If he could have a relationship with her, then with the help of the Nalan clan and the Misty Cloud Sect, our Mo clan’s position will be able to rise swiftly. When that time comes, the three other large clans will no longer be able to contend with us in the eastern region.”\\n\\n “According to what Mo Li said, that Nalan Yanran seemed to be quite difficult to rein in. After staying with a woman like Yun Yun for a long time, she is no longer the same sentimental girl that she was a few years ago.”\\n\\n “When dealing with this kind of haughty character in a woman, the warm methods of Mo Li would not have much effect. If there’s no change, tell him to think of something else. As long as he can get the woman to become our Mo clan’s daughter-in-law, I do not object to him using any underhanded tactics.” The old man said with a sinister smile.\\n\\n Hearing this, the few people in the room emitted an obscene, dry laughter. Clearly, as men, they were extremely clear on what “underhanded tactics” meant.\\n\\n “Alright. The outside still requires me to take control of the situation. Today, inform the subordinates to pay more attention. Additionally, send more people to thoroughly check the place where the little girl is being held. We must not let anything go wrong at this time.” The old man’s deep voice ordered.\\n\\n “Yes, sir.” The few people respectfully called out in response. They immediately stood up and slowly withdrew from the room.\\n\\n “Hmph. Misty Cloud Sect, just you wait. Sooner or later, my Mo clan will make you vomit up all the things that you have eaten!” In the dark room, the old man’s face twitched as a savageness faintly seeped out.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-253","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
