Majestic and shockingly cold auras continuously surged out of the bodies of these people. Finally, they influenced the environment of Ye City. The descending temperature within the city and the scattering snowflakes were surprisingly a result of the majestic, cold aura! “These… these are all people from the Ice River Valley?” “Why have they come to Ye City? Their lineup is this frightening?” “Don’t tell me that they have come after the Ye clan?” “Nonsense, the Ice River Valley’s status is far greater than the Ye clan or even all the five great clans. Why would they covet after the Ye clan.” “In that case, do you think that they summoned such a large force just to come to Ye City to play?” “......” Due to the sudden arrival of the Ice River Valley’s large army, that had come from all directions, Ye City descended into a great uproar. They did not understand just what kind of person could get one of the three large valleys, the Ice River Valley, to head over with such a large force. The cold air outside of the city was just like a natural barrier. It finally slowly came to a stop when it had spread around a radius of a hundred meters from the Ye clan. After which, they spread apart and covered the entire city. With this cold air barrier, Ye City was completely surrounded. No one could enter or leave! “Ye clan, hand over the Woeful Poison Lady and her group. Otherwise, the Ye clan will be destroyed today!” While the people in the city felt panic because of the cold air barrier that had suddenly formed, a faint elderly voice was slowly transmitted throughout the city, spurred on by powerful Dou Qi. Finally, it clearly resounded beside everyone’s ears. “Woeful Poison Lady? They are here because of the Woeful Poison Lady, no wonder…” “It is unexpected that the Woeful Poison Lady is at the Ye clan. These fellows are really bold…” The commotion within the city had calmed greatly when they heard this elderly voice. Some people sighed in relief. It seemed that the Ice River Valley was after the Ye clan. Although they had surrounded the city, the Ice River Valley was unlikely to harm the innocents as long as the others do not act recklessly. A couple of white figures slowly walked through the air and arrived. After which, they stopped walking and swept their eyes indifferently over the city. After which, their eyes paused on the center of the city where the Ye clan was located. The leader of these few white figures was surprisingly She Tian, who had fled miserably from Tian Huo zun-zhe’s hands back then. A couple of powerful Ice River Valley Elders were beside him. Additionally, there was an old man with white-colored woolen clothing. The old man had white hair and a warm smile hung on his face. Even Tian She’s eyes would contain some fear when he looked at this person. Following the appearance of Tian She’s group, another uproar appeared within the city. Numerous exclamations resounded over the place. “That is Tian She from the Ice River Valley? It is unexpected that even he has come this time around.” “You are really blind. All you see is Tian She, but you have failed to recognize that great being beside him.” “That… that is the First Elder of the Ice River Valley, Tian Shuang Zi? This… the Ice River Valley has even deployed him? It is rumored that this Tian Shuang Zi advanced to the Dou Zun class ten years ago.” “The Ice River Valley has really put up a hefty price to capture this Woeful Poison Lady…” While the city was in an uproar, the interior of the Ye clan was also extremely uneasy. All the members of the Ye clan were looking at the lineup in the sky with stunned expressions, especially Ye Zhong and the few Elders. Their faces were pale-white. “Tian Shuang Zi, Tian She…” Ye Zhong mouth slightly trembled. Either of these people was enough to destroy the current Ye clan. Now that the two of them were together, this Ye clan… “Woeful Poison Lady? Since when did our Ye clan hide the Woeful Poison Lady?” An Elder opened his mouth and questioned in panic. The people on his sides pondered his questions after hearing him. A moment later, they seemed to have recalled something. “Is it Xiao Yan’s group? The Woeful Poison Lady is among them?” Ye Zhong and the other few Elders suddenly understood something. Their bodies trembled. Finally, they understood who the culprit was… “What is there to panic about? It is not as though we are asking you to fight to the death with them.” A faint voice suddenly sounded while Ye Zhong’s group was panicking. Ye Zhong turned his eyes, only to see an elderly figure slowly appearing in the courtyard. That person was naturally Tian Huo zun-zhe. Ye Zhong and the others did not dare to slight Tian Huo zun-zhe. They could not afford to offend the Ice River Valley, but neither could they offend the person in front of them. At that moment, they could only reveal a bitter expression. Being caught in between two enormous beings was the most miserable fate. Tian Huo zun-zhe placed his hands behind him. His eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at the sky in the distance. His sight seemed to have penetrated through the air as it paused on the white-cotton-clothed, old man beside Tian She. “Dou Zun huh…” “They have still found this place…” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s softly muttered to himself. A soft sound also suddenly appeared by his side. Tian Huo zun-zhe turned his head only to see a young figure standing on the building eaves. His body stood as straight as a spear while a sharp aura was vaguely being emitted. Looking at his appearance, who else could it be other than Xiao Yan? “Ugh, they are indeed resourceful to be able to find us here. How is the Little Fairy Doctor?” Tian Huo zun-zhe moved. He appeared beside Xiao Yan and asked. “Soon. However, she cannot fight now.” Xiao Yan slightly nodded as he answered. “This time around, the Ice River Valley has sent some truly troublesome people. I will most likely be delayed by that old fellow…” A grave expression flashed across Tian Huo zun-zhe’s eyes. The current situation was not a good one. If he was restrained by a Dou Zun, Tian She would definitely attack Xiao Yan. The current Xiao Yan would likely have difficulty dealing with an expert at the peak of the Dou Zong class. Moreover, there were still quite a few similarly strong Ice River Valley’s Elders. Xiao Yan gently nodded. He also knew that they had descended into a dangerous situation. After letting out a soft slow breath, a ruthless expression suddenly flashed through his eyes. The experts that the Ice River Valley had deployed this time around had somewhat exceeded their expectations. However, they would likely have to put in a hefty price if they wished to crunch these hard bones. Otherwise, they would have difficulty succeeding. “Elder Ye Zhong, please rest assured. This matter is something caused by my group. Your Ye clan will not be implicated in it…” Xiao Yan turned his head and faced the white faces of Ye Zhongs and the others. He revealed a slight smile before finally turning his eyes to Tian Huo zun-zhe. He smiled and asked, “Old mister Yao, do you dare meet this Ice River Valley with me?” “Ke ke, the old me has even seen elite Dou Shengs back then, much less such a lineup…” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed. Xiao Yan chuckled. He raised his head and looked at the many white figures in the sky. A wave of pride surged from his heart. He had never feared fighting anyone ever since he had arrived in the Central Plains. Today, he would let this Ice River Valley know that they needed prepare a good set of teeth if they wanted to grind his hard bones. Xiao Yan’s pride surged to the sky as his feet stepped through empty air and shot to the sky. After which, he paused a short distance in front of Tian She’s group in front of a countless number of gazes. Tian Huo zun-zhe followed close behind. “Old demon Tian She, you fled quite quickly the last time. It is unexpected that you have summoned so many reinforcements…” Xiao Yan’s feet stepped onto the sky as he faced She Tian, who was holding a snake-shaped walking stick, on the other side. He involuntarily mocked. Tian She’s expression involuntarily become a lot darker when he heard Xiao Yan’s mockery. He said with a dense voice, “Brat, you can just gain the advantage of words. Once you land in the hands of the old me, the old me will let you understand what is called a fate worse than death!” “A person who only managed to last one exchange dares to speak such arrogant words?” Tian Huo zun-zhe grinned as he mocked. Seeing Tian Huo zun-zhe open his mouth, a terror also flashed across Tian She’s eyes. Clearly, he still possessed a deep memory of the dangerous battle from the last time. “Ha ha, this friend should be the person who defeated Tian She, right? Might I inquire your name?” The white-cotton-clothed, old man stared at Tian Huo zun-zhe and laughed. “Tian Huo.” “So it is actually Tian Huo zun-zhe. The old me is the First Elder of the Ice River Valley, Tian Shuang Zi.” The old man smiled in a seemingly friendly manner. However, his eyes rotated as he said, “This friend, today’s matter is the grudge between my Ice River Valley and the Woeful Poison Lady. Will you agree if the old me asks you not to intervene?” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed, but he did not reply. All he did was simply shake his head. The smile on Tian Shuang Zi’s face was not reduced when he saw this. He continued to speak with a smile, “In that case, the old me can only stop you…” “There is no need to hold back.” Tian Huo zun-zhe returned the smile. However, a faint chill had already appeared within his eyes. “Where is the Woeful Poison Lady? Could she be hiding again?” Tian She felt a little reassured when he saw the two exchanging tit for tat. He swept his gaze around him, but still failed to find the Little Fairy Doctor’s figure. He coldly laughed, “Today, my Ice River Valley has formed a city-locking formation around Ye City. None of you can flee!” Xiao Yan’s eyes gently drifted over Tian She. A faint chill also flashed within his dark-black eyes. “Ke ke, there is no need to delay any longer. Things might change if you delay for too long. Leave this person to me. Hopefully, you will not make things go awry again. Otherwise, the Valley Chief will not let you off easily…” Tian Shuang Zi’s old sharp eyes swept over the city. Immediately, he frowned. His sharp instincts told him that it was best to stop speaking to the people in front of him… After saying those words, Tian Shuang Zi once again stepped through the empty air. After which, he appeared ten meters away from Tian Huo zun-zhe. His eyes were locked onto Tian Huo zun-zhe. He did not even glance at Xiao Yan. Tian She nodded. His gaze was dark and ruthless as it turned to Xiao Yan. He laughed in a savage manner, “Brat, I want to see just who can rescue you this time around!” Xiao Yan’s expression was calm. Majestic Dou Qi began to slowly circulate within his body… “Tsk tsk, Elder Tian She, this person is the target of my ‘Hall of Souls.’ May I know if you can leave him to me to deal with?” Just as Tian She was about to attack, a dense-black fog suddenly rushed over from the distance. After which, it appeared in the sky. A strange laugh resounded as it did so. Xiao Yan’s calm expression instantly turned dangerous when this black fog appeared. His eyes revealed a ferocious expression as he looked at the black fog a short distance away. He spat out, “Hall of Souls?” “Tsk tsk… it is really unexpected. It has only been a few years since we last met, but you have advanced to the Dou Zong class. The old fellow’s eye for choosing a disciple is really quite good. However, regardless of how good his eyesight is, he was still ultimately captured by this protector. Ha ha!” The black fog churned and transformed into a black figure. A strange laugh, that caused Xiao Yan’s eyes to suddenly turn blood-red, was once again emitted. A shocking killing intent surged out of Xiao Yan’s body like a volcano. Both of his eyes were blood-red as a voice that contained an incomparable killing intent slipped between his teeth one word at a time! “Protector! Wu!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1094","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
