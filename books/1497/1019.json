The whirlwind gently shook and suddenly paused. After which, it transformed into a countless number of light spots, which scattered. Two figures rode a breeze as they slowly landed next to their seats.\n “It is actually Feng zun-zhe? Unexpectedly, four zun-zhe (Dou Zun) have arrived at this Grand Meeting. This trip has indeed been worthwhile.”\n “Usually, it is difficult to see even an elite Dou Zun, yet four of them have appeared together at this moment. The Four Pavilion Grand Meeting is extremely grand. No wonder it attracts so many people.”\n “Hee hee, I wonder just who will be the final victor of the Grand Meeting this time around?”\n The two people, who were the last to appear, naturally attracted the gazes of the entire stadium, more so for Xiao Yan. The two figures had just appeared when his gaze instantly turned to them.\n Xiao Yan had already met the green-clothed Mu Qing Luan. Hence, his eyes did not pause for long on her before they suddenly paused on the old man in front of her.\n The old man was wearing a green robe. His long hair spread over his shoulders, giving him a sort of free and easy appearance. That face of his could not be considered ordinary. Even though he was already very old, one could still vaguely see a handsomeness. It was likely that his appearance was definitely breathtaking when he was young. Looking at his outer appearance, he was clearly superior among the four Dou Zuns present. Perhaps it was because he practiced wind affinity Qi Method, but his demeanor appeared ethereal, giving others an unfathomable feeling.\n “Is he Feng zun-zhe?”\n Xiao Yan’s eyes slowly sized up the green-clothed, old man. An excitement also flashed across his eyes. He had heard about this Feng zun-zhe quite a number of times from Yao Lao. This person could be considered a friend of Yao Lao that had undergone life and death situations with him. If these words were true and he valued the relationship as greatly as what Yao Lao had described, Xiao Yan should be able to achieve a truly great helper this time around.\n An excitement rose within Xiao Yan’s heart. Lei zun-zhe and Jian zun-zhe on the seats smiled and cupped their hands together when they saw Feng zun-zhe arrived. Feng zun-zhe had become famous much earlier than any of the three others. Hence, these two people still cupped their hands politely despite all of them currently sharing the same status. However, Huang Quan zun-zhe by the side seemed to have a conflict with Feng zun-zhe. After narrowing his eyes and glancing at him, he turned his head and looked as though he had not seen him.\n The green-robed Feng zun-zhe’s face wore a warm smile. He reciprocated the courtesy of Lei zun-zhe and Jian zun-zhe. However, he did not give Huang Quan zun-zhe by the side another look. Although the four pavilions were afraid of each other, Feng zun-zhe was at odds with this Huang Quan zun-zhe. Moreover, the other party’s shadiness and ruthless character were things that Feng zun-zhe disliked.\n After the couple of them politely greeted each other, Lei zun-zhe raised his head and looked at the sky. After which, he slowly stood up and swept his gaze over the stadium. Immediately, the noisiness that shot toward the clouds became completely silent under those eyes that contained a faint lightning glow.\n “Today is the auspicious day that my Wind Lightning Pavilion will hold the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting. Thank you all for coming to the Lightning Mountain to support my Wind Lightning Pavilion. However, I think that everyone is aware of the rules of my Wind Lightning Pavilion. I hope that there will not be anyone interrupting the Grand Meeting when it is being held.” Lei zun-zhe’s faint voice was just like a thunder as it resounded over the entire Lightning Mountain. Moreover, his voice contained a hint of lightning might. Some of the weaker individuals involuntarily trembled.\n Lei zun-zhe’s words were filled with a domineering tone. It was just like an unyielding thunderbolt that did not allow anyone to refute it. Some people might not like to hear such words, but no one present dared to oppose him with his frightening strength. The frightening deterrence of an elite Dou Zun was really extraordinary.\n Lei zun-zhe only nodded slightly when he saw that no unusual noises had appeared. His hand was waved and a clear gong once again sounded in an unhurried manner.\n “The number of participants of this season’s Four Pavilion Grand Meeting is fifty-three, including the four disciples of the Four Pavilions. The old rules will still apply. It will begin with a chaotic battle until there are only eight people remaining. All the competitors please enter now.” Lei zun-zhe’s voice once again sounded when the gong appeared.\n Waves of rushing wind resounded over the stadium when Lei zun-zhe’s voice finished speaking. Immediately, numerous young figures flashed into the arena. Finally, they landed one after another and were spread around the arena. All of them were alert.\n The appearance of these people immediately caused the Grand Meeting to turn into one with a fiery hot atmosphere. Deafening cheers surged around the mountain in an overwhelming manner. They charged to the sky. The distant dark clouds had also begun to ripple as a result.\n Mu Qing Luan, Tang Ying, and Wang Chen in the VIP seats exchanged glances when the participants entered the arena. After which, their bodies moved and they gently landed in the arena. The moment these three people entered, their surroundings emitted a flapping sound as they became empty. Everyone present knew the strength of these three. Naturally no one would automatically deliver themselves to them.\n Being one of the main characters of this Grand Meeting, the entrance of Mu Qing Luan and the two others caused the cheers in the stadium to surge even more. The atmosphere on the mountain top had swiftly entered an extremely excited one following their entrances.\n “Screech!”\n A clear crane cry suddenly sounded in the sky the moment the three people entered the arena. Immediately, an enormous, colorful crane came gliding over from one side of the mountain top. A beautiful figure pressed her toes on the enormous crane’s back. The moving figure rushed down and landed in the arena without emitting the slightest noise. Xiao Yan’s eyes glanced over. The figure was naturally Feng Qi Er. Her noble demeanor was something that no one could compare with.\n The atmosphere outside of the arena immediately soared when Feng Qing Er entered. Everyone knew that the chances of this lady winning this season’s Four Pavilion Grand Meeting were the highest among all the participants.\n The moment Feng Qing Er appeared, surprise flashed across the eyes of Feng zun-zhe, Qian zun-zhe, and Huang Quan zun-zhe in the VIP seats. Immediately, Jian zun-zhe laughed, “Looks like Lei zun-zhe has really invested. You have even personally helped hide her actual strength. Are you planning on catching us by surprise?”\n Lei zun-zhe laughed out loud when he heard this. He said, “What is Qian zun-zhe saying? This girl’s status is a little unique. Therefore, I can only do it this way. There is really no other choice.”\n “Looks like Lei zun-zhe really wishes to continue holding the top seat of this season’s Four Pavilion Grand Meeting. The Wind Lightning Pavilion likely has the highest chance of victory in this competition.” Feng zun-zhe’s gaze paused on Feng Qing Er’s lovely body as he softly spoke.\n “Feng zun-zhe is thinking too much. That girl Qing Luan is someone from the Mythical Bird Tribe. If her bloodline awakens, she can also be considered an outstanding person among the younger generation.” Lei zun-zhe waved his hand and laughed. However, his eyes revealed a pride that ordinary people had difficulty detecting. He indeed coveted the thought of gaining the top spot in this season’s Four Pavilion Grand Meeting.\n Feng zun-zhe merely smiled noncommittally in the face of Lei zun-zhe’s words.\n Huang Quan zun-zhe by the side frowned. Wang Chen could be considered one of his most outstanding disciples after all these years. However, there was still a little gap when he was compared to Feng Qing Er. It seemed that the position of the Yellow Spring Pavilion would not experience too much change during this season’s Grand Meeting.\n The Yellow Spring Pavilion had always been ranked last among the four pavilions. However, Huang Quan zun-zhe was helpless to improve this. After all, the Yellow Spring Pavilion was indeed unable to compare with the other three pavilions when it came to the method of grooming the younger generation.\n Xiao Yan’s eyes were firmly locked onto Feng Qing Er while he sat on the silver wood. He had always felt a vague sense of danger when facing this woman. This had nothing to do with strength. It was just a vague feeling that was inexplicable…\n Xiao Yan knit his brows. His eyes slide as they slowly swept over the arena. At this moment, every corner of the arena had some competitors standing with a cautious faces. These people were all quite young, but they were exceptionally strong. Of course, those who had the qualification to participate in this Grand Meeting were definitely not ordinary people. They were either those with outstanding training talent or people supported by a strong faction.\n “This place is indeed worthy of being the Central Plains. Even in the Black-Corner Region, one would be hard pressed to find a couple of young Dou Huangs. It is unexpected that the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting has attracted so many of them…” Xiao Yan softly sighed. The Central Plains were indeed worthy of being the part of the Dou Qi continent with the most strong people. This place was filled with tons of talent. No one knew if there would suddenly be a complete dark horse appearing.\n “Huh?”\n While Xiao Yan was feeling amazed, his shifting gaze suddenly paused. A surprised ‘huh’ escaped from his mouth.\n The spot where Xiao Yan’s eyes had paused was coincidentally a corner of the arena. There was a black-clothed figure there. This person’s back faced Xiao Yan. Despite being a great distance away, Xiao Yan felt that this back was somewhat familiar for some unknown reason.\n Xiao Yan slightly frowned. With his current strength, this kind of familiar feeling would not appear without reason…\n While Xiao Yan was feeling uncertain, the black-clothed man clenched his hand, and a long spear flashed and appeared. His body also coincidentally shifted, allowing Xiao Yan to see the outline of his face.\n Xiao Yan was stunned for a moment when he saw that familiar face from the side. Finally, he abruptly clapped his hands. A stunned expression flashed across his eyes.\n “Lin Yan? What is that fellow doing here?”\n The person who had appeared in front of Xiao Yan’s eyes was surprisingly Lin Yan who had accompanied Xiao Yan from the Jia Nan Academy to the Jia Ma Empire back then. However, when Xiao Yan went to the valley to undertake a retreat, Lin Yan, Lin Xiu Ya, and Liu Qing left the Jia Ma Empire together. It was unexpected that Xiao Yan would actually be able to meet this fellow in this place…\n The surprise in Xiao Yan’s eyes gradually withdrew and he involuntarily shook his head. He had just arrived in the Central Plains for less than half a year, but he had actually met quite a few familiar people from back then. Fate was really unpredictable.\n “Since everyone has gathered, let the competition begin…”\n Lei zun-zhe from the leader’s seat ceased chatting when he saw that everyone had gathered in the arena. He raised his head and waved his hand. That faint voice of his resonated within everyone’s ears.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1019","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
