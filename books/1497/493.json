When he discovered that the red glow in his eyes was much better compared to back then, he nodded slightly and softly spoke, “Looks like the consumption of the ‘Ice Spirit Pill’ and the external application of the ‘Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid’ have an extremely notable results with the removal of this ‘Fire Poison.’”\\n\\n “Yes, it is indeed very effective. Each time after I train in the water in which one drop of ‘Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid’ is placed, that water would turn as red as blood. Moreover, I also sensed the Fire Poison in my body swiftly becoming weaker.” Lin Yan’s face was filled with excitement. This problem which had worried him for a long while could finally be completely cured now. This was undoubtedly extremely good news for him.\\n\\n “I think that if you use these medicines the way they should be used for another month, the Fire Poison in your body should be completely expelled.” Xiao Yan smiled and took out a bottle of ‘Ice Spirit Pill’ and ‘Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid.’ These medicines were completely refined by him while he was in his retreat. Hence, he saved the trouble of refining them again at this moment.\\n\\n Lin Yan snatched the two bottles of medicine from Xiao Yan’s hand in a lightning-like manner. He parted his mouth and smiled. He flung his hand and a pale-green-colored shadow was shot toward Xiao Yan.\\n\\n Xiao Yan dexterously received the green shadow that was shot over. There was a pale warm jade-like item in his hand. Xiao Yan’s eyes drifted and he was somewhat surprised to realize that this pale-green shadow was actually the ‘Green Wood Celestial Vine.’\\n\\n “This is?” Xiao Yan held the ‘Green Wood Celestial Vine’ tightly in his hand as he raised his head to speak to Lin Yan, “Aren’t you afraid that the medicine that I gave you will not completely cure you and you are giving this to me now?”\\n\\n “It is not like you are by yourself. Such a big ‘Pan’s Gate’ is present here. Do I need to be afraid of where you can run off to? Moreover, after personally experiencing it, I am even more clearly aware just how good the effect of this thing is than you, the person who refined it.” Lin Yan rolled his eyes, curled his lips and said.\\n\\n “Ke ke, in that case, thank you very much.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward Lin Yan and carefully stored this ‘Green Wood Celestial Vine,’ which he had obtained with great difficulty, within his storage ring. He immediately heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart. With this, he was only left with the final two ingredients needed to refine the ‘Ground Spirit Pill.’ However, the last two were also items that were extremely difficult to obtain...\\n\\n “Alright, now that I have obtained the thing I need, I should also be going.” Lin Yan waved his hand toward Xiao Yan before turning around and walking out of the door. Just before he exited through the door, he turned around and smiled as he said to Xiao Yan, “Although there is a mixture of a transaction between us, I, Lin Yan still owe you a favor. Don’t tell me that this green vine can be used as payment. My life is much more valuable than a withered branch.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan could only smile bitterly when he heard this.\\n\\n “If that Liu Qing comes and finds trouble with you in the future, you can send someone to inform me. I have not exchange blows with that fellow for a long while. I wonder how much sharper and overbearing his ‘Mountain Splitting Spear’ is compared to the past?” After saying this, Lin Yan exited the room and his footsteps gradually became distant.\\n\\n “Although this fellow has a violent temper, he may be considered a person one can befriend.” Xiao Yan laughed softly as he shook his head. He stood up, stretched his lazy waist before slowly walking out of the room.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan ge-ge, how much ‘Fire Energy’ is remaining on your Fire Crystal Card?” Xun Er played with the three green-colored Fire Crystal Cards on her hand within the hall. As she eyed the number on it, she involuntarily smiled bitterly and shook her head. After which, she raised her head and asked Xiao Yan, who had just descended from the upper floor, a question.\\n\\n “Uh… it appears like there is only thirty plus more… it is not even enough to train for ten days in the fourth level.” Xiao Yan was initially startled before he immediately replied helplessly.\\n\\n Xun Er sighed when she heard this. Her expression appeared a little vexed.\\n\\n “What is it? Do you all need ‘Fire Energy?’” Xiao Yan could not help but be stunned as he asked upon seeing this manner that she displayed.\\n\\n “It is not that we need but our ‘Pan’s Gate’ needs it…” Hu Jia to the side continued from where Xun Er left off as she said, “It is not like you don’t know that some of the rewards of ‘Pan’s Gate’ requires ‘Fire Energy.’ Now that ‘Pan Gate’ has just started, those ‘Fire Energy’ rewards that are required would naturally come from our own pockets. Xun Er’s ‘Fire Energy’ is almost used up. Recently, she did not even enter the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ to train even once… I have exchanged for a Dou Technique a while back so I don’t have much left. Now, I have handed over all of it. As for Wu Hao… this fellow is fast losing more than he makes in the Fighting Arena.”\\n\\n Wu Hao’s face involuntarily turned red when he heard the last couple of words that Hu Jia said. He laughed dryly, “It is because I am not used to it in the past. Recently, my winning percentage is increasing. Not long later, I should be able to earn back my losses.”\\n\\n “By the time you earn back your losses, ‘Pan’s Gate’ will have lost credibility due to the problem of not being able to pay some of the internal rewards. Once our credibility is lost, I’m afraid that those new members who have come after hearing about the ‘Fire Energy’ will immediately leave.” Hu Jia threw a look at him as she coldly snorted.\\n\\n Xiao Yan could not help but feel some guilt when he heard Hu Jia saying this. He had been merrily training, but Xun Er and Hu Jia had not even entered the tower for even a day…\\n\\n “Xiao Yan ge-ge need not think too much about it. You are currently the face of our ‘Pan’s Gate’ outside. This face naturally requires strength in order to support it. Without your deterrent effect outside, it would be difficult for this ‘Pan’s Gate’ to rise no matter what kind of measures we used.” Xun Er appeared to understand the guilt in Xiao Yan’s heart as she spoke gently with a slight smile.\\n\\n Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. He mused for a long while before slowly speaking, “Now that the ‘Fire Energy’ which everyone earned during the ‘Fire Energy Hunting Competition’ is about to be exhausted, it is indeed time for us to plan how to earn ‘Fire Energy’... Do you know how can one obtain ‘Fire Energy’ within the Inner Academy?”\\n\\n “The most inefficient method is to take up some cleaning type of low grade task within the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.’ However, this method would be too slow and it is also quite tiring. Hence, most of the people would wait for the ‘Fire Energy’ to be distributed by the Inner Academy each month. However, there are also some stronger people who would choose to enter the Fighting Arena and use their fighting results to win some ‘Fire Energy.’ This method is much faster but not as stable. This is because if there is the event where one meets an even stronger opponent, one would not only be unable to win ‘Fire Energy’ but would also lose quite a lot of it.” Xun Er’s delicate hand pulled apart her black hair that had drifted in front of her forehead while she voiced her thoughts.\\n\\n “There are also some people who enter deep into the mountains to hunt for Magical Beasts to search for various different kinds of medicinal ingredients. Moreover, outside of the Inner Academy are vast mountains that stretch for thousands of kilometers. Such a vast region does not lack some of the caves that the predecessors left behind. If one were lucky to find one, it would be an unexpected windfall. Those high class Dou Techniques, Qi Methods, etc. that were left behind by the ancient people sell very well within the Inner Academy. Moreover, the price usually leans toward the higher end.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan crossed his ten fingers together and quietly nodded. He asked softly, “Will anyone use ‘Fire Energy’ to purchase medicinal pills within the Inner Academy?”\\n\\n “One can naturally do so. Medicinal pills are extremely rare items that can be compared with Qi Techniques and Dou Skills.” Xun Er smiled and nodded. Her wandering eyes stopped on Xiao Yan’s body. Those watery pupils of hers contained a faint smile, “Why? Does Xiao Yan ge-ge intend to sell medicinal pills?”\\n\\n “This is my area of expertise. Naturally, I cannot abandon it.” Xiao Yan smiled and said, “Are there any other people selling medicinal pills within the Inner Academy?”\\n\\n Xun Er’s eyebrows were suddenly knit slightly together when this was mentioned. She smiled bitterly and nodded as she spoke, “There are indeed other people doing this. Moreover, it is not a person but a faction.”\\n\\n “Faction?” Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this.\\n\\n “This faction’s name is called the ‘Medicine Gang.’ Everyone in the gang is an alchemist that entered the Inner Academy from the Alchemist Department…” Xun Er voiced her thoughts, “This ‘Medicine Gang’ basically has a monopoly of over ninety percent of the medicinal pills being sold in the Inner Academy. Some of the other fragmented alchemists have difficulty contending against them. It is said that the leader of the ‘Medicine Gang’ is even able to refine a tier four medicinal pill.”\\n\\n “If we are also going to sell medicinal pills, I’m afraid that we will come into direct conflict with this ‘Medicine Gang.’”\\n\\n “Being able to refine a tier four medicinal pill huh…” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He smiled faintly and said, “Let’s not bother too much. After all, we also need to survive. Competition is naturally unavoidable. I am not afraid of them as long as they don’t use underhanded tactics.” Being only able to refine a tier four medicinal pill. Speaking from the view of Xiao Yan, who had successfully refined the ‘Three-Lines Green Spirit Pill,’ this leader was an opponent that was not too tricky to defeat.\\n\\n Seeing that Xiao Yan did not shrink back, Xun Er also nodded. She smiled and said, “Since this is the case, our ‘Pan’s Gate’ shall also sell medicinal pills. However, if this is the case, Xiao Yan ge-ge might have to toil a little.”\\n\\n “As the leader of ‘Pan’s Gate’, I naturally need to contribute a little. Otherwise, won’t I die of guilt when compared to all of you?” Xiao Yan smiled and asked.\\n\\n “If you want to sell medicinal pills, I suggest that you focus on the Fighting Arena. Everyday, there are people there who are injured because of a fight. Moreover, if you do not need too many materials to refine the medicinal pill that can recover Dou Qi, like the one you gave us to consume during the Hunting Competition back then, it is likely that there would be countless people competing to purchase it.” Wu Hao suggested. Having recently and frequently muddled along in the Fighting Arena, he naturally knew what kind of medicinal pill was valuable and scarce at that place.\\n\\n “‘Energy Recovery Pill’ huh… It is not very difficult but don’t tell me that the ‘Medicine Gang’ is unable to refine this kind of medicinal pill that can recover Dou Qi?” Xiao Yan mused for a while before he smiled and nodded. With his current refining skills, refining the ‘Energy Recovery Pill’ was an extremely easy matter.\\n\\n “They can… But the kind of medicinal pill which recovers Dou Qi that they refine does not have the same effect as your ‘Energy Recovery Pill.’ I bought one once, spending two days of ‘Fire Energy.’ Therefore, I can differentiate the difference between the two of them.” Wu Hao shook his head and said.\\n\\n Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He leaned his body on the back of the chair. His eyes suddenly brightened as he laughed softly, “Other than the Fighting Arena, perhaps within the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ is also a good place to swallow medicinal pills. The people training within it do not dare to train for a long time because they are afraid of the Fire Poison invading their bodies. If there is a kind of medicinal pill that can enable them to ignore the encroachment of the Fire Poison for a period of time, I think that there would likely be many people happy to purchase it…”\\n\\n “Ignore the encroachment of the Fire Poison?”\\n\\n “Ke ke, completely ignoring it would naturally be extremely difficult. However, the pill will allow a person to extend their stay of one day to two…” Xiao Yan smiled and explained.\\n\\n “Ah, this will indeed be an immense attraction for those people who are in a hurry to train…” Xun Er and the other two exchanged gazes and nodded.\\n\\n “In that case, let us decide it this way. From tomorrow on, I will give all of you a list that contains all the medicinal ingredients needed to refine the medicinal pills. All of you will go around and purchase them. Just leave the matter of refining the pills to me…”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-493","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
