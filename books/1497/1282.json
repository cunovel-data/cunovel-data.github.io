This was because he discovered that at this moment, the circulating Dou Qi within his body became sluggish. The fog that was permeated with rain droplets also rapidly disappeared. This scene naturally caused some shock to surge up ninth Tianzun’s heart. He suddenly raised his head, only to see an elderly figure suspended in the sky. That familiar face directly caused him to involuntarily exclaim. “Yao Chen? Your body… you have actually recovered your strength?” Ninth Tianzun had discovered with a glance that the current body of Yao Lao no longer possess that kind of illusory form like in the past. Clearly, it was an actual body. Moreover, the reason for his heart to sink rapidly was the frightening aura that filled Yao Lao’s body. That aura was so strong that it caused even his heart to pound a little. “Teacher? You have awoken?” Xiao Yan hurriedly turned around during the time that ninth Tianzun’s attack was blocked. He saw Yao Lao behind and a joy quickly surged onto his face. “Yes...” Yao Lao smiled slightly towards Xiao Yan. After which, he slowly said, “Little fellow, you should go and help the others first. Leave him to me…” Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment after hearing this before nodding his head. With his extraordinary Spiritual Perception, he was naturally able to sense that the aura of the current Yao Lao was extremely frightening. Such an aura was something that even ninth Tianzun in front and Hei Qing from back then could not compare with. This aura could even be considered the strongest that Xiao Yan had ever felt during these years. “Is this the strength of teacher at his peak… it is indeed very strong. No wonder he is able to possess that kind of reputation in the Central Plains back then.” Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart. After which, he drifted backwards in front of ninth Tianzun’s somewhat gloomy eyes. “Yao Chen, do you think that you can fight with my Hall of Soul just because you have recovered your peak strength?” Although ninth Tianzun greatly wanted to stop Xiao Yan, he understood that the Yao Chen in front of him had once again returned to being that renown Yao zun-zhe from the past. Even with his arrogance, he must admit that his current strength was no match for Yao Lao. “The Hall of Soul is not the strongest in the world. You have quite a number of powerful opponents. Some people are entangled until they do not dare to randomly attack. As long as certain people do not intervene, someone of your level is unable to threaten the old me!” Yao Lao laughed faintly. However, his smile had a slight chillness to to it, “Today, the Hall of Soul had launched such a big campaign against us and you have injured my only disciple. You must ultimately repay a little of this debt…” “Do you really think that this venerable self is afraid of you?” Ninth Tianzun’s face was dark and cold. His hand had a layer of blue luster. Immediately, his arm was twisted in a strange manner and escaped from Yao Lao’s restrain. He widened his mouth and a blue Dou Qi spluttered out in all directions. It swiftly agglomerated into a huge beast that bare its fangs and banished its claws. It carried a rich energy pressure as its sharp claws directly charged towards Yao Lao. Yao Lao’s expression remained calm in the face of the attack by ninth Tianzun. His hand was extended before it clenched abruptly. The space in front of him collapsed almost instantly and that enormous beast was directly broken apart. It transformed into water droplets that scattered in all directions. “Bang!” After destroying ninth Tianzun’s attack with a palm, Yao Lao’s hand aimed at the former across a great distance before slamming his palm forward. This palm had just slammed forward when the energy of this entire place immediately fluctuated intensely. An invisible large spatial hand directly blended into the space and rushed quietly towards ninth Tianzun. Although the spatial large hand was quiet, ninth Tianzun’s heart still sensed an extremely dangerous feeling. His hand seal changed hurriedly and a low cry sounded. The endless amount of icy cold energy from around him gathered and formed a thousand feet large blue water barrier. The large spatial hand violently landed on the enormous blue water barrier. Monstrous spatial strength spread at that moment and directly caused the space of this entire area to become distorted. The shocking momentum caused the expressions of quite a number of people to change drastically. “Bang!” The spatial strength swept apart. That seemingly strong and firm blue water barrier merely lasted for a moment before it emitted a ‘bang’ and exploded in the blink of an eye. Immediately, a crushing rain fell mightily from the sky and smashed onto the sea of tree, forming a clear rattling noise. “Groan…” Ninth Tianzun’s body staggered after the blue water barrier was broken. His body was directly forced back by a hundred over metres. A moan was also emitted from his throat. Clearly, this ninth Tianzun had suffered some injuries during this first exchange with Yao Lao, This spectacular battle in the sky naturally attracted the eyes of those experts in the distance. Some of the experience could also be considered to be very experienced. Hence, they recognised Yao Lao with a glance. Immediately, numerous exclamations resounded over the place one after another. “That… that person is Yao zun-zhe, Yao Chen? He is actually still alive?” “Isn’t it said that Yao Chen had lost his body and his strength is greatly reduced? Why is it now…” “With the recovery of Yao Chen’s strength, it is likely that the great calamity of the Falling Star Pavilion this time around can be resolved. The reputation and strength of the Falling Star Pavilion will also soar immediately. Even the three valleys will not be able to contend with them…” “......” Private conversations that were accompanied by some unknown emotion spread. Quite a number of people looked at each other. The expressions in their eyes were a little complicated. The return of Yao zun-zhe Yao Chen to the Central Plains was definitely a big news. Some of the experts from older generations were deeply able to feel the influence that Yao Lao had on the Central Plains back then. Although many years had passed, no one was able to surpass Yao Lao in being the top alchemist on the Central Plains. Even the three great heads of the Pill Tower had no choice but to admit that they could not be compared to Yao Chen… At this moment, this top alchemist of the Central Plains, who had disappeared for many years, had once again appeared. The shock and ripple that it created would naturally be earthshaking. Xiao Yan watched Yao Lao, who had completely taken the upper hand. He also revealed a faint smile. With Yao Lao having regained his peak strength, the Falling Star Pavilion will no longer need to worry about the Hall of Soul taking revenge in the future. After all, despite the Hall of Soul being strong, it was this great strength that caused it to possess many implications. Some of the peak experts could not randomly just attack. As long as these peak experts do not attack, the Falling Star Pavilion would be safe! “Bang!” Xiao Yan mused for a moment. A muffled sound was suddenly transmitted from the sky. Xiao Yan, whose heart sensed something, hurriedly raised his head. He frowned a little, only to see that the Sky Demon Puppet was being continuously defeated under the continuous fierce attack by Black Tianzun. Even its hard body had some vague dent appearing. Clearly, with the strength of the Sky Demon Puppet, it was a little too much for it to fight with Black Tianzun alone. Xiao Yan’s eyes paused on the Sky Demon Puppet for a moment before turning away. It turned towards the battleground between Qing Lin and White Tianzun. He was a little startled when he first looked towards this place. The expected situation of Qing Lin being defeated did not appear. All he saw was an extremely intense battle. The two figures violently collided with each other. Human figures flashed and a shocking energy ripple swiftly spread. “This aura… it’s that Ancient Heaven Serpent…” Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes slightly. He could sense that the aura of the current Qing Lin was vaguely a little brutal. This kind of feeling was something that he had personally experienced at the cave back then. Hence, he immediately understood that Qing Lin should have borrowed the strength of the Ancient Heaven Serpent soul. Otherwise, with her strength, it was impossible for her to engage in such a fiery hot battle with White Tianzun even with the help of the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. “There should not be any danger as long as the Black White Tianzuns here are held back. With the strength of old Feng’s and Little Fairy Doctor’s group, they should be able to block the other Hall of Soul experts from attacking…” Xiao Yan’s eyes flickered slightly. Since there was no problem on Qing Lin’s side, he should attack Black Tianzun. By joining hands with the Sky Demon Puppet, it should be possible for them to delay this fellow until he cannot divert his attention. However, in this situation, the greatest number of deaths would still be the ordinary disciples of the Falling Star Pavilion. It would be bad if things drag on for too long… During the time that Xiao Yan was frowning because of this, Yao Lao in the sky appeared to have sensed something. He lowered his head and watched the star realm, which was permeated by a bloody scent. A cold glint flickered within his eyes. He clenched his hand and an enormous spatial hand was once again formed. A palm smashed towards Black White Tianzun. How could the Black White Tianzuns, who were engaging in an intense battle with the Sky Demon Puppet and Qing Lin, anticipate such a sudden attack. Hence, they only recovered their attention after the attack arrived. Their faces immediately turned ghastly white. The frightening spatial strength gave them an extremely dangerous feeling. “Grug!” The large spatial hand violently landed on the bodies of the Black White Tianzun. After which, these two extremely powerful Tianzuns immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood in front of everyone’s eyes. Their bodies fell from the sky like meteorites and violently smashed into the forest. A thousand feet deep gully was formed. Seeing the Black White Tianzuns, who were unable to even endure for one exchange, those experts in the distant ended up inhaling a breath of cold air. “Bang bang bang!” After sending the Black White Tianzuns flying with a palm, Yao Lao once again flipped his palm a couple more times and continuously smashed them across the air. With the smashing of his palm, all of those Hall of Soul experts on the ground that came into contact with the enormous spatial hand would be blasted into a cluster of black fog almost instantly. Even their flesh were turned into dust. Under this slaughtering by Yao Lao, those experts from the Hall of Soul finally became terrified. In their panic, they fled in all directions. None of them dared to remain in the star realm for a moment longer. That ninth Tianzun had a gloomy expression upon seeing the terrible loss of the experts from the Hall of Soul. The situation had basically gone out of control with the appearance of Yao Chen… however, he was unwilling to simply give up in this manner! “Yao Chen, you have just recovered your strength and will definitely have difficulty completely unleashing it. This venerable self shall just watch whether you can turn things around with your strength and rescue this Falling Star Pavilion!” Ninth Tianzun inhaled a deep breath of air. His hand suddenly formed numerous dazzling seals with lightning like speed. Following the change in his seals, the surrounding space also slowly fluctuated. Immediately a spatial crack line was slowly formed. The moment the spatial crack line was torn open, a bone chilling monstrous aura was slowly being emitted from the crack line. “Even eighth Tianzun is here huh…” Upon sensing this bone chilling aura, Yao Lao’s brows twitched slightly and softly muttered to himself.
