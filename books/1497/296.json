{"id":46930,"no":296,"title":"Chapter 296: Gathering","content":"Chapter 296: Gathering\n After walking out from the alchemist association, Xiao Yan returned directly to the inn where he was staying at. He rested a couple of hours in the inn until he had recovered to his peak before he left the inn. He then walked to the Nalan clan to begin today’s poison removing session.\n Although he knew that the ‘Searing Poison’ within his body would become denser each time he helped Nalan Jie remove the poison, Xiao Yan could only continue in this manner in order to get the powerful energy contained in the ‘Searing Poison’ and the ‘Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva’. However, regardless of how abnormal the ‘Searing Poison’ was, he was not extremely concerned. After all, with the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ protecting his body, Xiao Yan believed that he could contend with the ‘Searing Poison’ even if it erupted inside him.\n After these few days where Nalan Jie and Nalan Su, personally saw him off, the entire Nalan clan had all come to know Xiao Yan as a young man with a cold expression. Therefore, when they saw his figure, not only did they not step forward to block him, they also respectfully bowed and greeted him when he passed by.\n Currently, the sky had already turned dark. However, the Nalan clan remained brightly lit. The members of the clan came and went on the paths, much like a marketplace.\n Xiao Yan walked past a couple of small paths with great familiarity and the spacious large hall of the Nalan clan once again appeared in his sight. He slowly walked closer. Waves of noisy laughter that were mixed with some melodies were emitted from the hall. This caused Xiao Yan, who liked serenity to frown slightly.\n Slowly walking into the hall, Xiao Yan lifted his eyes and glanced around. He saw that there were quite a number of people sitting within. They were smiling and conversing with each other, as if it was a fun gathering.\n Standing by the door, Xiao Yan’s gaze swept through the interior of the hall and was somewhat surprised to find that not only Liu Ling and Little Princess were present, but even Ya Fei was among them. The current her was wearing a red colored tight dress. A snow white fur coat covered her shoulders, adding a little grace and luxury to her appearance. Her beautiful and enchanting curves caused quite a number of men’s gazes to secretly shoot over to her.\n “Looks like I came at an inappropriate time…”\n Eyeing this lively hall, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He was just about to turn around and return when a female’s gentle voice suddenly sounded from his side, “Mister Yan Xiao, since you are here, why don’t you come in and rest for a while.”\n Hearing the voice, Xiao Yan tilted his head and eyed the delicate beauty standing beside a pillar. His indifferent face involuntarily became a little warmer. However, following closely after that, his face once again recovered its indifferentness as he said, “There’s no need. Nalan xiao-jie, I like silence and really don’t enjoy these kinds of scenes.”\n The beauty that appeared beside the pillar was naturally the most precious person of the Nalan clan, Nalan Yanran. She was currently standing prettily by the pillar. Her exquisite and peerless face contained a gentle smile. The wide sleeves, moon colored clothes that only a member of the Misty Cloud Sect could wear, occasionally revealed the graceful curves underneath. When comparing her figure, she did not appear to be any worse that Ya Fei. However, their auras were completely different.\n Seeing the current Nalan Yanran, Xiao Yan could not help but admit that during these three years, she had indeed changed from that spoiled youth back then to the current matured lady who had a refined presence. For such a lady, it would not be strange if one said that she was courted by all the men within thousands of kilometers.\n However, regardless of how Nalan Yanran changed, the one that was imprinted in Xiao Yan’s mind like a brand was always that spoiled girl who had forcefully broke the engagement in the Xiao clan, making things difficult for his father back then. Therefore, it had been difficult for Xiao Yan to display any nice expressions toward her.\n “Mister Yan Xiao, I heard that during the Alchemist Association’s internal test this time around your results were quite good.” Nalan Yanran had been seeing Xiao Yan’s icy face whenever they met during these couple of days. Therefore, Nalan Yanran did not withdraw because of his current expression. She slowly walked forward and said with a smile, “Congratulations.”\n As he sniffed the fragrance that shrouded around him, Xiao Yan’s footsteps moved toward the other side without anyone noticing. Xiao Yan did not feel that it was strange for her to know about the result of the Alchemist Association’s internal test. With the Nalan clan’s strength in the Jia Ma Empire, it was not difficult to know about this little bit of information. Moreover, in order to please her, what would that Liu Ling not say…\n “Luck” Xiao Yan said, shaking his head faintly. He spoke as if he cherished each word like precious gold, only spending a little at a time. His gaze did not even turn to Nalan Yanran as he spoke; he remained in silence.\n This indifferentness of Xiao Yan that isolated people far away from him caused Nalan Yanran to feel a little headache. In so many years, the young man in front of her was the first male to treat her so coldly. She smiled bitterly and shook her head, intending to cease speaking. However, she was about to step away when a numb gentle laughter that could cause men to feel their legs grow weak suddenly sounded behind them.\n “Hehe, Nalan xiao-jie, there are many people waiting for you inside. Yet you are leisurely chatting with someone here.”\n Hearing this familiar laughter, Xiao Yan turned his head. He eyed the bewitching woman who was carrying a cup of red wine and lazily leaning against the door. His cold and indifferent face melted slightly.\n “Hello Mister Yan Xiao. We meet again.” Ya Fei smiled and walked forward as she waved her transparent winecup at Xiao Yan. Her long pretty eyelashes emitted a fox demon like cunningness.\n “Why? Is Mister Yan Xiao and Ya Fei close?” Hearing Ya Fei’s greeting, Nalan Yanran’s eyebrows twitched without leaving a trace as she asked with a smile.\n “Yan Xiao and I have known each other for a few years and our relationship is quite good.” Ya Fei said and gave yet another smile. Her eyes rotated and swept toward Xiao Yan as she said with a smile still on her face, “Am I right, Mister Yan Xiao?”\n Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and took the winecup from Ya Fei’s hand in an offhanded manner. After which, he emptied it into his mouth in front of the latter’s slightly red pretty face. He said with a smile, “Why are you here?”\n Ya Fei grabbed the winecup from Xiao Yan’ hand and angrily said with a slightly red face, “You really are too rude…”\n Xiao Yan smiled as he stared at Ya Fei’s red and sleek face. The latter’s enchanting loveliness really moved people’s hearts. No wonder back at Wu Tan City, there were countless of men who shoved until their heads were injured as they rushed to the auction house in order to see Ya Fei’s appearance.\n “Back then, father also appeared to have such symptoms. An old bull eating the tender glass is not a good act…” Xiao Yan’s hand slowly fondled his chin as he suddenly thought mischievously in his heart.\n TL: An old bull eating the tender glass \u003d an old man having a woman much younger than him\n Nalan Yanran stood on one side and eyed these two people who had some signs of flirting. Her exquisite face became a little unnatural. She had originally thought that Xiao Yan’s coldness was caused by his character. However, when she saw the warmth in his smile between him and Ya Fei, she saw that it was completely void of the coldness that he had when treating her.\n “Mister Yan Xiao, Ya Fei xiao-jie, you can continue to chat. I will go first. Sorry.” Nalan Yanran bowed slightly to the two of them, turned around and walked into the large hall, leaving the moving figure of her back for them to see.\n As he watched Nalan Yanran’s back, which had left, Xiao Yan did not have any intention of staying any longer. He pursed up his lips and tasted the remaining taste of the red wine in his mouth.\n “Little fellow. You got some guts to actually take advantage of elder sister…” After Nalan Yanran left, Ya Fei’s eyebrows became vertical as she spoke to Xiao Yan with annoyance.\n Xiao Yan’s gaze swept passed Ya Fei’s face and finally stopped on those seductive red lips. He recalled the fascinating thought of the two of them drinking from the same winecup a moment ago. A smile surfaced on the corner of his mouth.\n As her mouth was being stared at by Xiao Yan, Ya Fei naturally knew what he was thinking. Immediately, an embarrassed redness flew onto her pretty face as she stomped her feet and scolded, “If you continue to act strangely, don’t blame elder sister for shouting your real name.”\n Seeing her embarrassed expression, Xiao Yan smiled and appropriately withdrew his gaze. “Why are you here?”\n “The matter of Grandfather Nalan gradually recovering is a big thing in the Nalan clan. As a business partner of the Nalan clan, us, the Primer clan was naturally among those invited.” Ya Fei faced the interior of the hall and fondled her snow white chin. She smiled and said, “Naturally, other than us the Primer clan, the people inside are mostly strengths which are quite well known in the Jia Ma Sacred City.”\n “Che, they have begun celebrating when the ‘Searing Poison’ has not even been completely removed? Isn’t this a little too early?” Hearing the information, Xiao Yan could not help but shake his head and said with his lips curled.\n “Ha ha. This is also because Grandfather Nalan trusts your ability. Although, even I did not expect that you would really be able to remove the ‘Searing Poison’ from Grandfather Nalan’s body. You should know that it is the ‘Searing Poison’ which even Pill-King Gu He had a headache over. Now, news about you is being spread between many different strengths in the empire.” Ya Fei’s pretty eyes stared at Xiao Yan as she said with some astonishment. Back then, when she recommended that he come to the Nalan clan, she had only adopted the thought of simply giving it a try. She had never thought that Xiao Yan would actually be able to cure Grandfather Nalan.\n “If it were not for that ‘Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva’, I would not be here…” Xiao Yan gaze swept over the large hall as he faintly replied.\n “You have also seen Nalan Yanran, but you are much more calm than I had expected.” Ya Fei said and gave a mischievous smile.\n “The one who saw her is Yan Xiao and not Xiao Yan…” Xiao Yan crossed his ten fingers. His gaze stared at the delicate woman who had become the center of attention the moment she walked into the hall. His dark black eyes contained an iciness.\n Ya Fei sighed and shook her head. She did not continue to inquire about this issue. Instead, she said with yet another smile, “Let’s go. Go in and take a look. Our clan head really wants to meet you, the outstanding young man who could cause Old Hai to show fear.”\n “Not interested.”\n “Please. Little fellow, Elder Sister has helped you so much. You cannot cause Elder Sister to lose face…” Seeing that Xiao Yan intended to leave, Ya Fei’s delicate hands were put together and she continued to shake them…\n “Ah, you are making people make stupid decisions…” Ya Fei was born with an enchanting aura. Adding this little girl like manner to it, Xiao Yan could only smile bitterly and shake his head at this visual assault. He waved his hand and helplessly said, “Alright. Let’s go and see.”\n Seeing that Xiao Yan had agreed, a joy immediately surfaced on Ya Fei’s pretty face. The little girl manner of her face instantly disappeared. She then turned around and elegantly led the way in front. Watching this swift change of hers, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and sighed. He could only follow her.\n They walked through the main door. The noisiness inside once again caused Xiao Yan to frown slightly. Ya Fei knew he liked quietness and hurriedly extended her delicate hand to pull him swiftly through the crowd.\n With Ya Fei’s appearance, it was natural that she would easily catch people’s eyes. Immediately, numerous gazes were shot over. When these gazes saw that Ya Fei’s and Xiao Yan’s hands which were being held together, they became momentarily blank. They immediately stared at the ordinary looking Xiao Yan with strange gazes. The current Ya Fei could also be considered a famous person in the Jia Ma Sacred City. At such an age, she already controlled the huge Primer Auction House Headquarters. This was the first time this had happened in the Primer clan. Moreover, she managed the auction house until it was in perfect order. This caused many people who had called her a flower vase to become quite shocked.\n TL: Flower vase - used to describe a beautiful woman who has no brains\n Although Ya Fei was warm on the surface and appeared extremely easy to converse with, people who were familiar with her knew that this enchanting, stunning creature had some sort of resistance to men. It was easy to be an ordinary friend, but if one wanted to progress to the next stage, it was fraught with difficulty. Therefore, when they saw that Ya Fei was actually holding hands with a man whose appearance was not great, their gazes were naturally a little strange.\n Of course, with Ya Fei’s appearance and aura, there was no shortage of admirers in the hall. The gazes that these people used to watch Xiao Yan were filled with sourness and fury.\n The various different kinds of gazes around him did not cause any changes on Xiao Yan’s face. He allowed Ya Fei to pull him as she pleased as his expression calmly endured those heated gazes.\n As they passed through the crowd, Ya Fei’s footsteps suddenly came to a stop. Xiao Yan’s gaze leaped over her and eyed the quiet seats in a corner. At that spot, a white haired old man was smiling as he conversed with those around him. His slightly strict old face faintly seeped out some dignity.\n “He is the head of our Primer clan, Primer Tengshan.” Ya Fei softly introduced. After which, she appeared to have sensed something and quickly released Xiao Yan’s hand. Her delicate fingers pulled aside the black hair on her forehead. Standing behind her, Xiao Yan could notice that the tender tip of her ears had become much redder.\n “Oh.” Xiao Yan randomly nodded his head. He followed Ya Fei and slowly walked onto the platform. After which, her footsteps came to a stop. Ya Fei then swiftly stepped forward, bent her body and softly said something to the old man’s ear.\n A long while later, the old man smiled and nodded. He raised his head, eyed Xiao Yan and stood up. He smiled and said, “Young friend Yan Xiao. I have heard about you for a long time and am pleased to finally meet you. I am the head of the Primer clan, Primer Tengshan.”\n “I am just a nameless person. How could I be worth anything for Clan Head Tengshan to care about?” Xiao Yan smiled and said.\n “There aren’t many people in the Jia Ma Empire who are able to receive such treatment from Old Hai. How could you young friend be considered nameless?” Primer Tengshan said with another smile.\n Xiao Yan smiled without speaking. He quietly muttered in his heart, “Looks like Hai Bo Dong relationship with the Primer clan is not an ordinary one. Don’t tell me that old fellow is also a member of the Primer clan?”\n “Ke ke, young friend Yan Xiao, please take a seat.” Primer Tengsan smiled and gave the seat beside him to Xiao Yan. He stepped back a little, smiled and said after he saw Xiao Yan take his offer, “Young friend Xiao Yan, your result at the Alchemist Association test this time around was quite good. Congratulations.”\n “Ah, I wonder if this Alchemist Association is purposefully letting leak the information or is their secret preservation skills extremely terrible. Why is it that everyone knows…” Hearing Primer Tengshan’s words, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He could only adopt a pretence and be courteous.\n “During this period of time that young friend Yan Xiao is in the Jia Ma Sacred City, you can directly go and look for Ya Fei if there is anything you need help with, especially since you and her are old friends.” Primer Tengshan said with a smile. Between his words, he described Xiao Yan and Ya Fei’s relationship in a very ambiguous way.\n Hearing this, Xiao Yan tilted his head and watched Ya Fei who had lifted the red wine and tasting it elegantly. Perhaps she had understood the meaning between Primer Tengshan words. Under the reflection of the red wine, her enchanting pretty face became an increasingly attractive sleek red.\n Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He could only give a vague response.\n After Hai Bo Dong’s reminder, Primer Tengshan was currently thinking of all the different methods to become closer to Xiao Yan. The usual strict expression had already been withdrawn. Replacing it was a smile that was extremely warm. That gentle manner caused those nearby who were on familiar terms with Primer Tengshan to be astonished. They began to quietly guess Xiao Yan’s identity in their hearts.\n Being the clan head, Primer Tengshan was naturally quite talkative. Moreover, there was still Ya Fei who would occasionally smile and gently interrupt the conversation. The atmosphere here appeared extremely harmonious.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-296","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
