There seemed to be a demonic strength within this voice. All the surroundings became completely still when it sounded. The expressions on the faces of a countless number of people froze at this moment. A gentle breeze blew past, carrying a completely comical dullness. No one knew just what exactly happened at this moment. However, the weight of Feng zun-zhe’s words appeared exceptionally clear in this place. It was likely that hardly anyone in this Dou Qi continent dared to doubt the weight of an elite Dou Zun. At the edge of the arena, Mu Qing Luan was similarly widening her small mouth as she looked to where Feng zun-zhe was sitting. Her heart was filled with shock. She had never seen the free and easy Feng zun-zhe reveal such a decisive emotion despite having trained under him for so many years. She clearly understood what the words that Feng zun-zhe had uttered at this moment meant. If this matter was not resolved properly, they would likely become the enemies of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Although the Falling Star Pavilion was not afraid of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, the implications of these two large factions going to war would really be a little terrifying… Despite such a serious consequence, Feng zun-zhe had spoken without hesitation because of something that Xiao Yan had given him! At this moment, even her little head involuntarily felt a little jealous. She suddenly recalled the words that Xiao Yan had said to her back in the Heaven Eye Mountain Range, “A disciple of an old friend?” Mu Qing Luan’s narrowed eyebrows became vertical, and she felt a little lost. Although Feng zun-zhe had many friends, their relationships were far from sufficient to reach the point where he did not hesitate to become enemies with the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Just who was this old friend? Mu Qing Luan was not the only one who had such thoughts. Almost everyone present, with the exception of Xiao Yan, was somewhat lost and shocked… A quiet atmosphere covered the entire sky. Even the churning clouds in the sky had slowly quietened at this moment… This atmosphere continued for awhile before Lei zun-zhe on the VIP seats finally recovered slowly. He turned his head and his eyes that contained a flicker of lightning locked onto Feng zun-zhe while demanding in a deep voice, “Feng zun-zhe, what do you mean by this?” It was likely that everyone could hear the little thread of anger contained in Lei zun-zhe’s voice. “Ke ke, Feng zun-zhe, we can discuss this nicely…” Jian zun-zhe was similarly stunned because of this. He had also not expected Feng zun-zhe to step forward. Moreover, he had stood out in a manner where there was no turning back. Huang Quan zun-zhe’s eyes flickered. However, he did not speak. Instead, he was coldly laughing in his heart. Feng zun-zhe had shut his eyes in front of a countless number of gazes. He finally opened his eyes again. The emotions within were hidden deep inside his heart. Not a single word was spoken. Instead, his sight stared straight into the air where Xiao Yan was standing. His voice was hoarse, “You and… he, what is your relationship?” By being able to let an elite Dou Zun reveal such an emotional fluctuation, anyone could tell that the item Xiao Yan had tossed him earlier possessed an important meaning to him. Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air as he looked at Feng zun-zhe’s old face. All the emotional fluctuation from earlier indicated that Yao Lao’s eyesight was very good… Xiao Yan stood straight in the air. He respectfully bowed and cupped his hands to Feng zun-zhe. His voice carried pride, “Teacher and disciple!” Feng zun-zhe slightly nodded. His body moved and appeared in front of Xiao Yan. There was kindness in the gaze, which he used to look at Xiao Yan. He softly said, “This is the answer that I want to hear the most. However, you need to provide me with evidence.” Xiao Yan smiled. He extended his hand and pointed to the fire seal on his forehead. After which, a tiny wisp of a dense-white flame swiftly sprang onto the tip of his finger. “Bone Chilling Flame…” Feng zun-zhe’s eyes were startled when he saw the tiny dense-white flame. He was not unfamiliar with this flame. Back then, if this flame had not been there when he was in a critical state, it was likely that the current Feng zun-zhe would not… Feng zun-zhe was naturally aware of the transfer of a Heavenly Flame. Moreover, with his eyesight, he could vaguely sense an extremely faint but familiar feeling that extended deep into his soul from the fire seal on Xiao Yan’s forehead. Hence, he understood that this ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ should be something that his old friend had voluntarily stored in Xiao Yan’s body rather than something that he had taken through trickery… Moreover, all of this was strong evidence that could prove the relationship between Xiao Yan and Yao Lao! Feng Zun Zhe slowly raised his head as he inhaled a breath of air. His voice was hoarse as he said, “Old fellow, you have made it difficult for me to find you all these years…” Xiao Yan was quiet when he heard the little exultation and tiredness within Feng zun-zhe’s voice. It seemed that this good friend, whom teacher had spoken of, had continuously searched for traces of him all these years… one had not lived in vain if one had such a good friend. Although teacher had been wrong about Han Feng back then, at the very least, he had chosen the right person as a good friend. “Feng zun-zhe…” Feng zun-zhe waved his hand and softly laughed, “You are his disciple. Please don’t address me in this manner. The old me is called Feng Xian. I shall not speak of my relationship with him in detail. If you do not mind, you can also consider the old me as your teacher in the future.” With Feng zun-zhe’s status in the Central Plains, there was an incredible number of people who wanted to call him teacher. However, he had only accepted Mu Qing Luan as his disciple after all these years. Moreover, this was due to the relationship he had with her clan. It was the first time that he had ever asked someone to call him teacher. “The disciple of an old friend greets Old Feng.” Xiao Yan was also not a foolish person. He naturally understood as hurriedly greeted him in a respectful manner. Feng zun-zhe heartily laughed and nodded. He said, “Leave the matter today to me.” After saying this, he did not wait for Xiao Yan to say anything more. He turned around for the first time and his gaze was thrown onto the cold face of Lei zun-zhe. With a grin, he said, “Lei zun-zhe, I can give in to you with regards to other matters today. However, the Wind Lightning Pavilion cannot touch Xiao Yan!” “This is a matter between the Wind Lightning Pavilion and him. If Feng zun-zhe insists on interfering, it will likely affect the relationship between our two pavilions.” Lei zun-zhe looked deeply at Feng zun-zhe as he spoke. “If anything happens to him today, the final result will be a war between the two pavilions.” Feng zun-zhe replied. The decisiveness in his voice caused even Xiao Yan to tremble. Lei zun-zhe frowned. His hand also slowly tightened on the armrest of his chair. He did not expect the free and easy Feng zun-zhe to gain such a stern side with him today. Feng zun-zhe was the one who had been famous for the longest amount of time among the four pavilions. If they were to really discuss the him, his strength should be the greatest among the four Dou Zuns. Even Lei zun-zhe was a little afraid of him. The implication of a war between the two pavilions was far too great. Even with Lei zun-zhe’s boldness, he did not dare to say it out loud. Yet… “Just what relationship does this person have with Feng zun-zhe? Why would Feng zun-zhe protect him with all his ability?” Lei zun-zhe’s eyes were clearly dark and solemn. However, these questions of his were something that everyone present wanted to know. Lei zun-zhe slowly inhaled a breath of air. His deep voice appeared to carry a thread of thunder as it resounded over the sky with a bang, “Feng zun-zhe, Xiao Yan has secretly learned the Three Thousand Lightning Movement of my Wind Lightning Pavilion, and has even obtained the training method to practice the Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body. If this matter is set aside by just one word from you, how will my Wind Lightning Pavilion do anything in the future?” Feng zun-zhe’s expression was like that of a rippleless well. Forget about this. Even if Xiao Yan was an extremely evil person, he would definitely not allow Xiao Yan to suffer any harm today. There was no reason for this other than that he was the disciple of that old fellow… “Lei zun-zhe’s words are too arbitrary. The Three Thousand Lightning Movement is merely something that the little me came across outside of the Central Plains. Its origins are from abroad. How can you say that I secretly learned it? If that is the case, would that not mean that anyone who practices those Dou Skills would all be seeking their own death. The Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body, on the other hand, has been taken back by the northern pavilion chief. I think that he should be aware of this.” Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice. Fei Tian’s face slightly sank. His eyes stared viciously at Xiao Yan. However, he did not dare to randomly attack this time around. Feng zun-zhe was beside Xiao Yan. If he dared to attack, his ending would likely not be good. Fei Tian was still quite afraid of an expert like Feng zun-zhe. Lei zun-zhe was non-committal to Xiao Yan’s words. Currently, the one who was most troublesome to deal with was Feng zun-zhe. If he wanted to protect Xiao Yan, it was likely that the matter today would turn into a stiff one. This was not something he was happy to see. Regardless of who the victor was in a war between two pavilions, they would both suffer great losses. At that time, it would only allow others to benefit from their fight. Lei zun-zhe’s finger gently tapped on his armrest before finally sighing. He faintly said, “This matter is ultimately something that started between Xiao Yan and the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Why don’t we do this? On account of Feng zun-zhe’s face, this matter will be handed to Fei Tian. Regardless of who is the victor between them, this matter will come to an end. The both of us will not intervene in this matter. What do you say?” Feng zun-zhe’s eyes were lowered when he heard this. He glanced at Fei Tian below before immediately shaking his head and laughing, “There is too large a gap between Fei Tian’s and Xiao Yan’s seniority. Bullying the weak and the young is not a good reputation.” Lei zun-zhe’s face also sank after he was rejected by Feng zun-zhe. He said, “In that case, what does Feng zun-zhe want to do? Do you want my Wind Lightning Pavilion to do nothing and let Xiao Yan off? I will definitely not do such a thing!” “Ke ke, let’s all talk nicely. Why don’t we do this. Fei Tian’s seniority is indeed much greater than Xiao Yan’s. It is not good to get him to fight. Why don’t we get someone from the younger generation to do so?” Jian zun-zhe smiled and piped up when he saw that the atmosphere was not quite right. “Does Jian zun-zhe mean to get Qing Er and Xiao Yan to fight?” Lei zun-zhe narrowed his eyes. However, his gaze turned to Feng Qing Er in the arena. Jian zun-zhe grinned and nodded. His eyes looked at Feng Qing Er with a deeper meaning and said, “This little girl is also not an ordinary person. There is no need for Lei zun-zhe to conceal anything.” Lei zun-zhe slightly frowned. He mused for a moment before immediately nodding. His eyes looked at Feng zun-zhe as he spoke in a deep voice, “Since Feng zun-zhe thinks that Fei Tian is too senior, I will get Qing Er to fight. If Xiao Yan is defeated, he must promise not to use the Three Thousand Lightning Movement in the future. If Qing Er loses, the grudge between Xiao Yan and the Wind Lightning Pavilion will be settled. What do you say? Of course, the precondition to this exchange is the prohibition of using anyone else’s Spiritual Strength!” Lei zun-zhe glaced at Xiao Yan when he spoke until the end. It was likely that he was also aware that Xiao Yan possessed an exceptionally strong spiritual body on him. Feng zun-zhe hesitated for a moment when he heard this. He was similarly aware that Feng Qing Er was not an ordinary person. It was likely that even Qing Luan was no match for her among those of the same generation present. However, this situation was the limit the Wind Lightning Pavilion was willing to give in. If this failed, it was likely that there would not be anything left to discuss… While Feng zun-zhe was hesitating, Feng Qing Er at the edge of the arena gently shifted her feet as she entered the stage. Her pretty eyes turned to Xiao Yan. Her clear cool voice carried a haughtiness as it slowly sounded. “Wind Lightning Pavilion’s Feng Qing Er. Xiao Yan, do you dare accept this challenge?” Xiao Yan’s eyes immediately paused on Feng Qing Er’s well-proportioned, voluminous body. He smiled. A haughtiness surged out of his heart. He was naturally aware of the difficult situation Feng zun-zhe was facing. Moreover, he was Yao Lao’s disciple no matter how one put it. At the very least, he could not cause his teacher to lose face in front of this old friend. “I will accept your challenge!” A loud clear laugh, filled with pride, sounded!
