Swallowing a Heavenly Flame that was ranked near the end would no longer significantly raise his strength, yet Yao Lao was currently saying that this strength was still insufficient. Wan’t this a little too shocking?\\n\\n “Ugh, there is only one of each of the top three Heavenly Flames on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. How could it be so easy to subdue this type of divine object that has terrified all beings?” Yao Lao shook his head and softly sighed. “I have read some ancient texts while you were in your retreat. The texts briefly mentioned some information related to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. The demon flame appears once every thousand years, but no one has been able to subdue it even now. You should be able to understand a little more from this.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s expression changed. He tilted his in agreement. The birth of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame would attract the peak experts of this world, but no one successfully tamed it even with its many appearances. This alone was enough to prove just how frightening it was!\\n\\n Since those peak experts had ended up failing, Xiao Yan would not be able to subdue it with his one star initial level Dou Sheng strength.\\n\\n “You must prepare to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.” Yao Lao’s expression was grave as he spoke. Xiao Yan already boasted the strength of a Dou Sheng. If he were given an ordinary Heavenly Flame to swallow, his strength wouldn’t rise much, so if he wished to significantly raise his strength again, he would need to search for the top three Heavenly Flames.\\n\\n “Does that Nine Serene Spring have anything we need?” Xiao Yan asked.\\n\\n “Aye.” Yao Lao slowly nodded. He clenched his hand, and an ancient dark-red scroll appeared in it. A wave of cold ripple spread the moment the scroll appeared. These ripples filled the surrounding air. It was as though a cold sea of clouds had appeared. This scroll was quite mysterious.\\n\\n “This is a tier 9 medicinal formula that I spent a lot price to obtain. It is called the Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill. While you are subduing the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, you can insert it into the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s body. The extreme Yin force will weaken the Demon Flame, increasing the chances of successfully subduing it.” Yao Lao rubbed this ancient scroll. He had paid a large price for this medicinal formula in order to take it from the hands of an alchemist guru.\\n\\n “However, you need a key ingredient in order to refine this Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill. That ingredient is the Spring Blood Crystal. This Spring Blood Crystal only forms at the bottom of the spring. Hence, you must make a trip to the Nine Serene Spring within these nine months. There you need to obtain a Spring Blood Crystal and then find time to refine a Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill. Only by doing this will you have a higher chance of subduing the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes looked at the ancient dark-red scroll. He slowly nodded a moment later. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was really too important to him. Therefore, he needed to obtain it regardless of what happened. If he failed this time around, waiting another thousand years for the demon flame to appear again would be extremely difficult for him…\\n\\n “It has been many years since I have prepared something in order to swallow a Heavenly Flame…\\n\\n Xiao Yan softly sighed after receiving the ancient dark-red scroll. He had only refined some medicinal pills to swallow a Heavenly Flame when he had swallowed the Green Lotus Core Flame and the Falling Heart Flame. Since then, he had simply swallowed the other Heavenly Flames he found. There was no need to prepare anything. It was unexpected that he needed to perform these old steps again.\\n\\n “There is no other way. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is not something the Three Thousand Burning Flame can compare with. Just imagine what kind of great being the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was. It was rumored that his death was because of a backlash from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.” Yao Lao explained.\\n\\n “Oh?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s heart quivered after hearing this rumor. His face revealed a solemn expression. That Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was at least a nine star Dou Sheng. Even such an expert ended up dying to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. His one star Dou Sheng strength was really insufficient.\\n\\n “Looks like I must prepare this Nine Yin Spring Pill…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan slowly nodded. He immediately said, “Is the Nine Serene Spring managed by the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python?”\\n\\n “Aye, the Nine Serene Spring is located deep underground. That place is the territory of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python. They view that place as a holy ground. Any Nine Serene Deep Ground Python that is about to advance in rank will soak inside it. Soaking will smooth their breakthrough. However, the spring water in the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python has a dark and cold affinity. It is a mysterious training ground for snake Magical Beasts that are of this affinity. However, even I do not dare to venture deep into it because the Nine Serene Spring is too dark and cold.” Yao Lao spoke in a solemn voice.\\n\\n “Fortunately, you possess four types of Heavenly Flames. With the Heavenly Flames protecting your body, you should be able to reach the deepest part of the Nine Serene Spring to obtain the Spring Blood Crystals. That place can be also considered a sacred ground to Cai Lin. A Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python is a divine snake species while the Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python is an existence comparable to the Ancient Heaven Python King. If Cai Lin is able to successfully evolve within the Nine Serene Spring, her strength will undoubtedly soar.” Yao Lao smiled and said. “If she evolves into a Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python, the snake form that she can transform will be able to devour an entire mountain range. It will even be able to devour the sky itself.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan nodded. The Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python was by itself rare, but the Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python was even rarer. Even during ancient times, it had sparingly appeared. He would not doubt Cai Lin’s strength after she successfully evolved.\\n\\n “Since the Nine Serene Spring is managed by the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python, they will naturally stop us from entering.” Xiao Yan voiced his thoughts. The Nine Serene Deep Ground Python was also one of the three great tribes within the Magical Beast World. Their strength could not be underestimated. There would definitely be true peak experts present. It was likely that this trip would not be relaxing.\\n\\n “With your current strength, there are extremely few in the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe that can defeat you. Those old demons that hide themselves will not appear often. Of course, should that really happen, you can tear the spatial token. I will frequently be with ancestor Hou Yun during this period of time. We will hurry over if we are summoned. With the current strength of our Sky Mansion Alliance, we have nothing to fear from them…” Yao Lao laughed.\\n\\n Xiao Yan smiled after hearing Yao Lao’s words. The Falling Star Pavilion might not be comparable to the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe, but the alliance had formed. With the alliance’s strength, there was no longer a need for them to be afraid of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe.\\n\\n “In that case, we should leave tomorrow since we are pressed for time.” Xiao Yan also understood that they were a little tight in terms of time. They were approaching the time when the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame would appear. He needed to refine the Nine Yin Spring Pill before that event happened. Otherwise, if he ended up failing to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, he would not even be able to regret failing.\\n\\n “Aye, you can rest assured that I will ensure that the matters of the alliance are taken care of.”\\n\\n Yao Lao smiled and nodded.\\n\\n The moment the sky turned bright the next morning, Xiao Yan led Cai Lin, the Little Fairy Doctor, and Qing Tan out of the Falling Star Pavilion. They hurried to the beast region.\\n\\n This was not the first time Xiao Yan had headed to the beast region, so he was quite familiar with the route. His strength had soared. Naturally, his speed was many times faster. The journey, which would have taken a couple of days in the past, was made in half a day.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s group did not stay in one place for long after having entered the Beast Region. They headed to the region where the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python Tribe was.\\n\\n The true settlement of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe was deep underground even though they had many branches on the surface. The numbers that this tribe boasted could be ranked at the top of the three large clans, but its large numbers resulted in its bloodline becoming impure. Based on the estimation of the Elders of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python, the ancient bloodline of all the tribe members of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python would be exhausted within a hundred years if this continued. At that time, the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python would end up in a situation where they were similar to an ordinary Magical Beast.\\n\\n Many arguments happened within the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe because of this matter. However, without the supplement of an ancient bloodline, it was only a matter of time for that day to come at the rate they bred.\\n\\n ...\\n\\n The Nine Serene Ground Abyss was a key tunnel that led into the underground world. It was also occupied by the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. Hence, the defenses were quite tight, but these tight defenses were something that only deterred ordinary experts. With Xiao Yan’s current strength, such a defenses would not even be able to detect his figure.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s group appeared on top of a mountain a short distance away from the deep abyss. Xiao Yan glanced at the tight defenses, only to shake his head. He was just about to activate the spatial strength to bring everyone into the deep abyss when the rushing sound of wind was suddenly emitted a short distance away. A couple of figures flashed and hurried over from the horizon. They appeared above the deep abyss within a couple of flashes.\\n\\n “These people… they seems to be members of the Ancient Void Dragon tribe?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan looked at the few figures as surprise flashed across his face. There was a tendril of Dragon Phoenix bloodline inside his body. Naturally, he had a special ability to sense the blood of an Ancient Void Dragon, but he was surprised to find that he would meet members of the Ancient Void Dragon tribe in this place.\\n\\n “Could it be that Zi Yan has sent them? However, she should be out resolving the matters of the other three great dragon kings. Why would she dispatch people to the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe since they have no relation with them?” Xiao Yan frowned. A thought quickly passed through his heart as a fluctuation spread from his body. This fluctuation swiftly spread apart. Soon after this fluctuation spread, a halting voice was transmitted into his ear through the air.\\n\\n “Dragon King… dispatch…”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1456","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
