His eyes glanced at the thick white flame on his body’s surface and could not help but swallow his saliva. At that moment, under the strange temperature of the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’, the surrounding water was beginning to tumble as though it was boiling. As it continued to emit white-colored water bubbles, threads of dark purple liquid that was difficult to see with one’s eyes gradually appeared. However, when these tendrils of dark purple liquid came into contact with the thick white flame, they were frozen by the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ into extremely tiny ice threads that gradually sunk to the bottom of the lake.\n Eying the small purple-colored ice threads that continued to form around his body, Xiao Yan felt the skin on his head grow numb. He did not expect that this lake which appeared extremely calm would actually have so much hidden fatal poison liquid.\n “Stop wasting time! These poison liquids are extremely potent. Although having the protection of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ can prevent them from entering your body, it depletes far too much of my Spiritual Strength!” Just as Xiao Yan sighed in surprise, Yao Lao’s grave voice sounded in his heart.\n “Okay.” Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded his head. His flicked his legs and his head surfaced from the water. Eyeing the small island at the middle of the lake, Xiao Yan let out a gentle breath and used his hands to paddle quickly. His body left a water ripple as he gradually neared the island.\n The journey was calm all the way until they were about to reach the small island. Just when Xiao Yan was about to sigh in relief, water droplets suddenly splashed through the sky from the calm lake surface in front of him. The sudden occurrence caused Xiao Yan’s heart to suddenly tightened. He lifted his head and stared intently at where the water droplets had been violently scattered and shrunk his eyes an instant later.\n The water droplets flew and sprinkled down. At one point in time, a huge serpent whose body was covered in dark green scales and possessed a triangular shaped head suddenly rushed out from the bottom of the lake. After which, it widened its huge, savage mouth and violently bit at Xiao Yan. Its rhombus shaped eyes were filled with a wild viciousness.\n “Dammit. Isn’t this small lake far too abnormal?” The huge serpent’s wild attack caused Xiao Yan to angrily scolded. His palm slammed heavily on the surface of the water. Instantly, the water splashed in all directions. Borrowing the force from it, Xiao Yan’s body completely left the water, inclined a little downwards while falling and was parallel to the lake surface with his nose almost touch the water. However, the tip of Xiao Yan’s feet gently but quickly pressed onto a cluster of water waves. Instantly, there was a ‘bang’ sound and his body was like a cannonball, shooting forward while keeping close to the water’s surface.\n “Bang, bang, bang!”\n Xiao Yan’s body wildly rushed toward the small island like a whirlwind. Behind him, a few intense sounds of exploding waves sounded. These were caused by the attacks from the huge serpent that missed him.\n Xiao Yan was not too concerned about the irregular wind force that was present behind him. He used the strength from these attacks to repeatedly dodge a number of the huge serpent’s next attacks. Finally, when he was around ten meters from the small island, the corner of his eyes glanced behind him and realized that the huge serpent was opening its large savage mouth again as it broke through the water and chased him.\n Xiao Yan coldly laughed. His finger tapped on the storage ring and a piece of a wooden plank fell onto the surface of the water. At the moment it was about to be corroded by the poison liquid in the lake water, the tip of Xiao Yan’s feet pressed gently onto it. His body sunk slightly and once again shot forward. An instant later, he finally entered the confines of the small island. Xiao Yan flipped his body in the air, his legs squatted down and his palm gently pressed on the ground, making a steady landing.\n Stepping his feet on the small island, Xiao Yan turned around to take a look. He realized that when the huge savage serpent had entered the area within ten meters from the small island, it began to be afraid and did not dare advance. It simply swung its serpent tail and moved back and forth outside the small island. After extending its scarlet serpent tongue and viciously staring at Xiao Yan for a long time, it finally helplessly returned back to the bottom of the lake.\n Upon seeing the lake gradually becoming calm. Xiao Yan finally sighed in relief. He turned around and looked over the island. The island was not very large. A lush bamboo forest and some plants were growing all over it, giving it an extremely beautiful appearance of thriving with life.\n “The scent of a ‘Heavenly Flame’...” Xiao Yan inhaled a breath. Being in such close proximity, even Xiao Yan appeared to be able to sense the presence of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ hidden on the island. A hot flame pulsated in his dark eyes as he tightly clenched his fist. Xiao Yan swore silently in his heart that this time around, regardless of what happens, he must get ahold of the ‘Heavenly Flame’. He had put in far too much effort for it.\n On his body, the thick white-colored flame was gradually extinguished. Yao Lao’s voice once again sounded, “Be careful. Queen Medusa is also on the island. However, she should not be in a state of mind to notice you. I will help you perfectly hide your Qi. Later, just act according to the situation.”\n “Yes.” Xiao Yan nodded his head. His breathing gradually became calm. After standing by the side of the lake for quite a while, he opened his light footsteps and slowly entered into the bamboo forest.\n The atmosphere was quiet as Xiao Yan walked along a small path in the bamboo forest. Other than the extremely soft sound of Xiao Yan’s footsteps landing on the grass and leaves, there were no other sounds.\n At the moment, Yao Lao did not open his mouth to lead the way but Xiao Yan was still able to use the strange ‘Heavenly Flame’ Qi that was faintly transmitting through the air to locate the correct path.\n With normal paced footsteps, Xiao Yan passed through the end of a couple of small paths. His vision was also gradually becoming more open and clear. The instant when he passed through a small path, Xiao Yan’s body suddenly bent down and quickly hid within some bushes. His sight passed through the cover by the leaves and eyed the open place at the middle of the small island.\n This place was a round open area. All the bamboo and bushes around it were completely removed while extremely small smooth pebbles were scattered within it. These pebbles were depressed to form a small pond with crystal clear liquid water. The surface of the liquid water was shrouded by a white fog. Even over a significant distance, Xiao Yan was still able to feel the extremely cold temperature it possessed.\n “‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’...” Xiao Yan’s eyes stared intently at the crystal clear liquid. A long while later, he inhaled a long breath of deep cold air. Back then, he put in great pains to exchange a small bottle of this ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ from Gu Te. Yet here, a small pond was filled with it, tsk tsk… this wealth was so large: it was a little frightening.\n The shock in Xiao Yan heart slowly calmed down. Xiao Yan gradually shifted his gaze and finally stopped on a lotus seat carved out using a strange crystal located at the middle of the pond. At this moment, a cluster of green-colored flames was slowly soaring on the lotus seat.\n As he eyed the cluster of green-colored flame, Xiao Yan’s eyes suddenly shrunk to the size of a pinhole. A frantic desire suddenly broke from Xiao Yan’s heart and openly surfaced on his delicate and handsome face.\n This cluster of green-colored flame had a spirituality. As it writhed, it would occasionally agglomerate into the shape of a lotus or into a small narrow green-colored flame snake that floated and circled within the lotus seat. Its docile manner was extremely cute.\n Xiao Yan stared at the green-colored flame repeatedly changing shape with unblinking eyes. The corner of his mouth continued to twitch as Xiao Yan hid inside the forest. In his excitement, Xiao Yan’s hands had pushed themselves into the ground.\n “I have finally found you…” Xiao Yan pressed his lips together as he stared intently at that cluster of green-colored flame. He had never seen the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, but he had trained on the Green Lotus. Thus he was able to faintly feel a familiar feeling from the cluster of green-colored flame that was the same as that of the Green Lotus.\n After spending a few years of hard work, this was the first time Xiao Yan saw a ‘Heavenly Flame’ at such a close proximity. Of course, this was excluding Yao Lao’s ‘Heavenly Flame’. However, it was impossible for the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ that was controlled by Yao Lao’s spirit to allow Xiao Yan to sense the terror and wildness of a ‘Heavenly Flame’.\n The crystal lotus platform was evidently not an ordinary thing. Each time the green-colored flame was about to swim out of the boundary of the lotus seat, a round pale white-colored glow would suddenly appear. After which, it would catapult the ‘Heavenly Flame’ back.\n Xiao Yan’s gaze scanned the pond in detail and realised that each time after the ‘Heavenly Flame’ and the glow came into contact, the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ in the pond would diminish by a tiny amount that could not be detected. Clearly, the crystal lotus seat borrowed the strength of the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ in order to trap the green-colored flame within it.\n After sweeping his gaze across the small pond, Xiao Yan looked to the left. A face which was beautiful to the point of bewitching was imprinted into his eyes. Xiao Yan’s originally weak breath was once again suppressed without him realizing it. Facing this extremely strong Dou Huang level person, Xiao Yan felt like a huge rock was pressed onto his heart and was oppressing him.\n There was not the slightest difference between the current Queen Medusa and the energy body that had previously appeared outside the city. A luxurious and expensive purple-colored gorgeous gown was wrapped around her graceful and lovely body. Her voluminous and hot exquisite figure released an enchanting temptation. She had a pair of long and narrow pale purple pupils. When her bewitching gaze roamed, it spread an addiction that seemingly sucked almost every man’s eyes to her.\n Below the purple-colored gorgeous gown, a purple-colored snake tail was revealed. It lazily swayed around, releasing a wild and peculiar loveliness.\n The current Queen Medusa’s beautiful eyes were staring intently at the green-colored flame in the middle of the pond. Under the reflection of the light, a flame was also flashing in the pale purple eyes.\n After quietly staring at this green-colored flame for a long time, Queen Medusa suddenly let out a gentle sigh. She raised her head and looked at the sky. Immediately, she swung her snake’s tail and her hot lovely body slowly stood up.\n “It is time…” After mumbling softly, a rare hesitation flashed across Queen Medusa bewitching face. An instant later, the hesitation turned into determination. Two snow white wrists were revealed from under the purple-colored gown and her delicate hands slowly formed a few seals in front of her body.\n Following the change in the seal formed by Queen Medusa’s hand, the crystal lotus seat suddenly trembled intensely. The light curtains above it gradually disappeared. After the light curtains disappeared, the green-colored flame which had lost its restraints abruptly charged out and grew with the wind. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a torrent of intense flames.\n Under this cluster of intense flame, the ‘Icy Spirit Cold Fountain’ began evaporating at a rate that was visible to the naked eye.\n Ignoring the bamboo around her that were grilled to the point that they were quickly withering, Queen Medusa gently bit her lip with her teeth. Her hands slowly undid the buttons of her gown. Instantly, a perfect female’s body that appeared to be the masterpiece of the heavens was exposed within the bamboo forest.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-214","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
