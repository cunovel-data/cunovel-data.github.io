Immediately, numerous cries of disbelief were emitted from Xiao Li, First Elder Su Qian, and a couple of others.\\n\\n “Third brother?”\\n\\n “Xiao Yan?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan removed the black Doupeng completely from his head and stored it into his Storage Ring. His shrugged his shoulders toward Xiao Li’s group whose faces were filled with disbelief. He smiled and said, “Why? Don’t you recognise me?”\\n\\n Xiao Li’s group slowly recovered from their shock after hearing this familiar voice. Joy instantly surged onto their faces. Xiao Li took strode over and violently patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders before laughing with a face filled with smiles, “It is unexpected that the mysterious tier 6 alchemist is actually you. You really caused us to worry.”\\n\\n A warmth also surged in Xiao Yan’s heart as he looked at Xiao Li, whose face was filled with joy. He softly laughed, “The situation in the Black Emperor City is not quite right. Moreover, I’m worried that those fellows from the Demon Flame Valley would recognize me. Hence, I have hidden my shape and face.”\\n\\n “Hee hee, these words are true. A drawing of you has already been passed to every high ranking person in the Demon Flame Valley. Should you reveal yourself, they would definitely recognize you.” Xiao Li laughed.\\n\\n “This is?” Xiao Li’s gaze suddenly turned to the Little Fairy Doctor by Xiao Yan’s side. The smile on his face was withdrawn as he politely inquired. Given the Little Fairy Doctor’s Dou Zong class strength, even Xiao Li did not dare to be too careless with his words.\\n\\n “She is my friend. Second brother can call her the Little Fairy Doctor.” Xiao Yan laughed.\\n\\n “Big brother Xiao Li.” The Little Fairy Doctor’s exquisite face by the side revealed a smile as she softly spoke to Xiao Li.\\n\\n “Ugh… you flatter me, you flatter me. Miss is really too polite.” Xiao Li hurriedly waved his hand as he replied. His entire body trembled after being addressed by the Little Fairy Doctor as big brother Xiao Li. When they were at the Black Emperor Pavilion back then, he had personally felt the dense killing intent that had pervaded her body. He naturally knew that despite the ethereal and moving appearance of this lady, she was definitely a vicious person when she attacked. Moreover, this was the first time in his life that he had been addressed so courteously by an elite Dou Zong. Therefore, his heart appeared to be somewhat flustered.\\n\\n Xiao Yan was also similarly stunned by the Little Fairy Doctor’s form of address. His gaze was a little surprised as he glanced at her. She actually addressed someone in this manner given her character?\\n\\n The Little Fairy Doctor acted as though she did not see Xiao Yan’s surprised gaze while a smile hung on her face. She appeared like the kind girl from Qingshan Town back then. She looked completely innocent, causing one to feel extremely attracted to her.\\n\\n Xiao Li whispered in his heart as he looked at the two people. He naturally knew that this lady, whose hair was as white as snow, was this courteous to him on the account of Xiao Yan. Hence, his heart let out a bitter laugh. Did this third brother of his have a great affinity with women? Moreover, the women by his side were not ordinary people. Medusa from the last time was also a genuine elite Dou Zong. This time around, this Little Fairy Doctor, who appeared from nowhere, was actually an elite Dou Zong whom even First Elder Su Qian was quite afraid of.\\n\\n “Little fellow, you actually know how to return to the ‘Black-Corner Region’...” While Xiao Li was sighing in his heart about how Xiao Yan had such a great affinity with women, First Elder Su Qian had also recovered from his earlier shock. He took two steps forward and spoke with some resentment.\\n\\n Xiao Yan gave an embarrassed smile when he heard this. He hurriedly said, “First Elder, please forgive me. Originally, I should have made a trip over earlier, but I undertook a year long retreat in order to breakthrough to the Dou Huang class which ended up delaying this trip.”\\n\\n “You have broken through to the Dou Huang class?” Xiao Li was immediately stunned when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. He asked with a surprised voice. Although he knew that Xiao Yan was already at the peak of the Dou Wang class when he left back then, it was quite difficult to breakthrough this barrier. Some people had even remained at the peak of the Dou Wang class for their entire life. Yet, Xiao Yan was able to breakthrough the barrier within a short one year. This speed was naturally considered unusually terrifying.\\n\\n The eyes of Su Qian by the side were also a little shocked. From Xiao Yan’s ability to refine a tier 6 medicinal pill, he had guessed that Xiao Yan might have already broken through that barrier. However, his heart still felt extremely surprised after hearing the person in question say it out loud. This kind of training speed could be considered at the peak that Su Qian had seen after so many years.\\n\\n “I was merely lucky.” Xiao Yan slightly smiled. The people present were those whom he could trust. Hence, he would naturally not purposefully hide something.\\n\\n “Ha ha, little fellow, you have done well. Father’s eyesight is really different. From the very beginning, he knew that you were not an ordinary person.” Xiao Li laughed out loud. His excitement was even greater than if he had broken past the Dou Wang class.\\n\\n Some sadness flashed through Xiao Yan’s eyes without leaving a trace when he heard Xiao Li mention their father. It immediately disappeared as Xiao Yan smiled and said, “The main reason I have revealed myself is to request second brother’s and First Elder Su Qian’s help.”\\n\\n “Ah, we are one family, why are you saying help? You are ‘Xiao Gate’s’ chief and have the authority to maneuver everyone in the faction.” Xiao Li curled his mouth when he heard this. He immediately turned to the ten plus experts from ‘Xiao Gate’ and cried out, “This is my third brother, the chief whom all of you have heard about. Why aren’t you greeting him?”\\n\\n The ten plus experts from ‘Xiao Gate,’ who possessed extraordinary strength, immediately knelt with one knee on the ground after hearing Xiao Li’s cry. They respectfully said, “These subordinates greet chief!”\\n\\n These experts from ‘Xiao Gate’ did not hesitate even a little when they knelt. They naturally felt a great joy with the status that Xiao Yan had revealed. They might not be certain of Xiao Yan’s strength. However, just being a tier 6 alchemist was enough to cause their hearts to be filled with excitement.\\n\\n Xiao Yan smiled as he looked at the experts from ‘Xiao Gate’ who had knelt down. He immediately waved his sleeves gently. The energy fluctuated and a gentle breeze lifted everyone up. He smiled and said, “Everyone here is brothers of ‘Xiao Gate.’ There is no need to be so polite. We can forget about all these unnecessary rituals.”\\n\\n The hearts of these experts from ‘Xiao Gate’ shivered when they felt Xiao Yan easily lift them up by simply raising his hand. They no longer held the slightest doubt about Xiao Yan’s strength in their hearts. These members of the Xiao Gate would display a greater confidence when walking outside with such a powerful chief.\\n\\n Xiao Yan walked into the hall after lifting everyone up. After which, he unceremoniously sat in a chair beside the table. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan also followed him and sat down. The latter pulled down her black robe. Silk like purple-colored hair rolled down as she parted her mouth and smiled at the stunned face of First Elder Su Qian.\\n\\n “You girl… you actually also followed him back.” First Elder Su Qian spoke helplessly after seeing that the last black-robed person was actually Zi Yan. He felt neither able to laugh nor cry.\\n\\n “Zi Yan also possesses the strength of a Dou Huang. Other than some elite Dou Zong, she can walk this ‘Black-Corner Region’ without any fear.”\\n\\n Su Qian was startled when he heard this. His gaze immediately swept over Zi Yan with surprise as he said, “This girl has actually broken through to the Dou Huang class.”\\n\\n Zi Yan immediately waved her small fist, feeling pleased when she saw the surprise on Su Qian’s face. She said, “Old fellow, I said that trapping me in the Inner Academy back then is definitely a form of harm to me. If you had let me out earlier, I might already be an elite Dou Zong now.”\\n\\n “Don’t dispute the old me. If I had not gotten you to follow beside Xiao Yan, I would not know if you had been sold by someone. What Dou Zong…” Su Qian shook his head as he replied, feeling neither able to laugh nor cry.\\n\\n Zi Yan’s fine eyebrows became vertical when she heard Su Qian’s words. She was about to go wild when Xiao Yan’s palm was placed on her small head, pressing her into her seat. “Be quiet.”\\n\\n Zi Yan unhappily shook her head after Xiao Yan pressed down on her. She felt bitterly dispirited as she lay on the table. Her eyes were viciously staring at the smiling Su Qian.\\n\\n “It looks like only you are able to control this mischievous girl. I have experienced a much quieter time after she left the Inner Academy. The Inner Academy also no longer needs to worry about when it will lose a large amount of medicinal ingredients.” Su Qian softly laughed after seeing Zi Yan being restrained by Xiao Yan. He immediately seemed to have recalled something as he stared at Xiao Yan and said, “That’s right. Since you have come to the ‘Black-Corner Region’, you should quickly return and supplement the Heart Flame of the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’. That ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ has already lost its effect for half a year.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan awkwardly nodded when he heard this. He hurriedly said, “First Elder, please rest assured that I will return to the Inner Academy to replenish the Heart Flame after this matter is over.”\\n\\n Seeing this, Su Qian let out a snort and took out a bright-red scroll from his storage ring. He threw it to Xiao Yan and said, “Take it. This is the ruler technique Dou Skill that your second brother had bought for you in the auction. He was actually willing to offend an elite Dou Zong for this thing.” His gaze drifted to the Little Fairy Doctor by Xiao Yan’s side when he spoke until this point. He also muttered in his heart, questioning why the woman companions by Xiao Yan’s side always possessed such a frightening strength.\\n\\n Xiao Yan received the bright-red scroll and felt the faint warmth of it. A warm feeling flowed into his heart. At that time, Xiao Li was not aware of their identities. Despite this, he dared to auction for this ruler technique Dou Skill. Xiao Li intended to increase the Xiao Yan’s strength by a little. This affection was that of blood-related brothers.\\n\\n “Don’t be moved for nothing. You are the most precious person in our Xiao clan. Big brother said that everyone can die but you. Hence, you should live well and quickly become strong. This is because you are the only one with the ability to rescue father from the damn ‘Hall of Souls’.” Xiao Li curled his mouth when he saw Xiao Yan staring at the scroll. He smiled and continued, “Let’s quickly proceed to talk about the important matter. What is the reason for you to come and look for us?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan also smiled when he heard this. He gently nodded and stored the scroll into his Storage Ring. After musing for a moment, his face gradually turned solemn as his gaze swept over Xiao Li and Su Qian. He said in a soft, deep voice, “I wish to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-850","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
