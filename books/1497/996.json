The light that they emitted caused this area to appear quite bright. The dense fog had also been scattered by the big battle that had occurred earlier. Hence, it had resulted in this place becoming much more visible.\\n\\n There were five figures in the empty ground. Four were male and one was female. Their strengths were all quite great. Clearly, they were not weaklings. Moreover, this kind of aura was not something that an ordinary person could emit. The five auras were similarly strong.\\n\\n One of the four men was wearing deep-yellow clothing. Additionally, there was a knife scar on his face. He was currently sitting on a tree branch, leaning against the tree trunk. His gaze lazily swept over the place below as he faintly said, “Hurry up…”\\n\\n The other three men on the ground hurriedly nodded their heads upon hearing this person speak. The three of them were wearing yellow-colored robes and wore a similar badge on their chests. It seemed that they belonged to the same faction.\\n\\n “Hand over the Psychic White Fox. It is not as though we have not done something like killing a woman…”\\n\\n The lady was holding a longsword in her hand. Her pale-green clothing wrapped around her exquisite figure until it was vividly displayed. Her voluminous figure was extremely attractive, and her black hair, which was randomly restrained by a green-colored cloth, extended to her lovely buttocks. That young and pretty appearance of hers was not foreign. It was surprisingly Nalan Yanran who had accompanied Yun Yun in leaving Jia Ma Empire back then.\\n\\n A couple of years had passed. The current Nalan Yanran no longer had the tenderness that she had back then.When she moved, she would emit an alluring mature attraction. The pampered young lady back then had truly become a great beauty that could bring destruction to cities and empires.\\n\\n TL: Extreme beauty is said to be able to cause destruction of empires because they tend to be able to distract the ruler from doing the right things or from working\\n\\n There was a lovely little white-colored fox on Nalan Yanran’s shoulders. This white fox had snow-white fur which was extremely smooth. At a glance, one would have the feeling of liking it too much to put it down. It possessed lethal impact on women.\\n\\n At this moment, the pair of intelligent eyes belonging to this white fox were roaming all around. It seemed that the killing intent, which was permeating from the bodies of the tree people on the opposite side, had caused the snow-white fur to show signs of trembling. A soft babbling was emitted from its mouth.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran seemed to have sensed the fear of the little, white fox. She gently rubbed its head before slowly raising her head. Those pretty eyes of hers were icily staring at the three people opposite her. She tightened her grip on the longsword as a sharp sword aura slowly surged out. Two ice-cold words were also softly emitted from her mouth.\\n\\n “Dream on.”\\n\\n “Hee hee, what a stubborn beauty. However, you are a little too stubborn. With your five star Dou Huang strength, you can forget about escaping from the hands of the three of us. Obediently hand over the white fox. Otherwise, I would not mind enjoying just how much ecstasy such a beauty would give…” A yellow-clothed man stared at Nalan Yanran with a searing gaze. He involuntarily licked his lips, and his eyes contained a lewd look.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran’s pretty face had also become even icier upon hearing such despicable words from this fellow. The strength of the three people across from her were around that of a four star Dou Huang. If it had been one-on-one, she was confident that she could kill them within a short period of time. However, if these three were to attack together, she would have difficulty blocking them. Moreover, these three people belonged to the same faction. They collaborated well with one another. During the earlier exchange, she had nearly suffered a disadvantage. The thing which gave her the most pressure was the man who had been sitting on the tree. This person had not attacked since the beginning. However, Nalan Yanran sensed a faint pressure when facing him from the opposite side. Clearly, the other party’s strength was much stronger than hers.\\n\\n “The Ground Spirit Gate is indeed a place where garbage is produced.”\\n\\n The expressions of the three yellow-clothed men became slightly colder when they saw that Nalan Yanran had identified their faction. With their strength, they were also considered the elites within the younger generation of the Ground Spirit Gate. Although they could not be compared with people like Tang Ying and Miss Feng, they still had some reputation. If they had not needed the Psychic White Fox to lead the way when they entered the Heaven Eye Mountain Range, they would not have become enemies with a five star Dou Huang for no reason. However, since they had already done so, there was naturally no way to change things.\\n\\n The three of them exchanged glances. Immediately, they nodded slightly and decided not to continue getting entangled in this matter. Their bodies moved and formed a triangular shape, surrounding Nalan Yanran. Powerful deep-yellow Dou Qi surged out of their bodies.\\n\\n “Ground Drawing Prison!”\\n\\n The hands of the three of them violently landed on the ground. The land shook and the soil rapidly churned. Rock fragments shot out. In the blink of an eye, a cage that was formed from the soil broke out of the ground and trapped Nalan Yanran within.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran knit her brows upon seeing this. Her feet pressed on the ground and her lovely body was like a spinning top that swiftly rotated. Sharp sword aura shot in all directions and viciously cut at the cage, causing many cut lines to quickly appear.\\n\\n The three yellow-clothed men fiercely slammed their hands on the ground when they saw that the cage was swiftly collapsing under Nalan Yanran’s hands. Three yellow-colored spears, created from mud, immediately shot out of the ground. After which, they were quickly grabbed by the three of them. Their feet stomped on the ground as they shot toward Nalan Yanran in the middle.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran did not dare to slight the combined attack of three four star Dou Huangs. The longsword in her hand was wrapped by powerful sword aura as it trickily and viciously pierced out in a lightning-like manner.\\n\\n “Chi! Chi!”\\n\\n Four figures exchanged blows within the cage in a lightning-like manner. Sword aura spread everywhere, forming numerous deep gullies in the ground. The three yellow-clothed men seemed to be aware of the sharpness of Nalan Yanran’s sword aura. Therefore, they did not forcefully attack. Instead, they relied on their long lasting ground affinity Dou Qi to slowly exhaust her Dou Qi.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran was similarly aware of the exhaustion tactic the three had adopted. However, she did not have any means to deal with it. These three people were cooperating extremely well and had firmly restricted her from the beginning. This caused her to lack even the slightest opportunity to rest. If this were to be prolonged, Dou Qi deficiency would result in the interior of her body…\\n\\n Clang! Clang! Clang!\\n\\n The longsword pierced into the three spear tips in a lightning-like manner. Nalan Yanran’s pretty face turned cold as sharp sword auras suddenly shot out!\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n Three mud spears were blown apart when they were struck by the sword aura. However, before Nalan Yanran could continue pressing her attack, the ground shook and an enormous sharp mud pillar shot out, causing her to hurriedly withdraw.\\n\\n When Nalan Yanran’s body landed, the three people on across from her formed more long spears. A deep-yellow armor had also appeared on their bodies at this moment, covering them with firm protection. Ground affinity Qi Methods usually specialized in being long lasting defenses…\\n\\n “You are worthy of being a five star Dou Huang by being so troublesome to deal with. However, it will end here. With the Dou Qi in your body, it is likely that you will not be able to endure for long. Hand the Psychic White Fox over to us and we will let you off.” A low, deep sound was emitted from the deep-yellow armor.\\n\\n “You can use these words to trick a three year old child.” Nalan Yanran coldly laughed when she heard this. She was no longer that young lady from back then. Her experience in the Central Plains during these years had also allowed her to understand quite a lot of principles.\\n\\n “Stubborn fool. You’re seeking death!”\\n\\n The three of them became impatient when they saw that Nalan Yanran still would not submit. Their hands faced each other from a distance and six deed-yellow-colored Dou Qi light pillars shot out. Immediately, they transformed into a triangular shape of encircling light.\\n\\n “The Spirit of Land, Earth Melting Skill!”\\n\\n The three people cried out sharply. Deep-yellow Dou Qi swiftly agglomerated in front of one of them. That powerful Dou Qi, that had gathered the strength of the three of them, caused even Nalan Yanran to change her expression.\\n\\n When the cry sounded, the deep-yellow Dou Qi swiftly became distorted. Immediately, it transformed into a ferocious Earth Dragon. It let out a roar and transformed into a light ray with a bang. Finally, it shot straight toward Nalan Yanran. A deep gully appeared on the empty ground where it passed, appearing like a bull plowing the fields…\\n\\n “This Earth Melting Skill of the Ground Spirit Gate does possess some uniqueness…” The man on the tree branch glanced at the Earth Dragon in front of him and softly said.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran clenched her silver teeth as she looked at the Earth Dragon ferociously shooting over. Her hand tossed the little white fox on her shoulders aside, and a deep-green-colored Dou Qi swiftly formed a wind wall in front of her.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n The Earth Dragon collided with the wind wall. The sharp wind blades that comprised the wall cut the Earth Dragon until it repeatedly trembled. However, this did not successfully stop the Earth Dragon’s attack. Both parties continued in this state for a moment before the wind wall exploded with a bang.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran was revealed to the Earth Dragon when the wind wall burst apart. It immediately roared at the former as its ferocious mouth bit down at Nalan Yanran’s head.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran’s pretty face became slightly pale when she saw the Earth Dragon in close proximity. She was just about to use her Dou Qi when she was shocked to realize that her body had been entwined by an unusual black-colored energy.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n A sharp wind forming a fist shot over from the dense fog a short distance away just when the Earth Dragon was about to pounce onto Nalan Yanran. It immediately smashed into the Earth Dragon. It shook before transforming into light spots that burst apart.\\n\\n The sudden unexpected change surprised everyone. This included the man in the tree branch. He threw his somewhat shocked eyes toward the spot where the fist wind had been emitted.\\n\\n “Who is it? I am Huang Tian from the Ground Spirit Gate. Friend, please do not meddle in other people’s business!”\\n\\n The yellow-clothed man swept his gaze cautiously around him as he spoke with a deep voice.\\n\\n “Aren’t you afraid of throwing away the face of the Ground Spirit Gate by having so many men bully a girl?” A mocking laugh was emitted from the dense fog. Immediately, soft footsteps sounded. A moment later, a skinny figure appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.\\n\\n Nalan Yanran, who was still in a state of shock, raised her head as she looked at the figure that was slowly walking out of the dense fog. She was just about to voice her thanks when she saw that face. Her body immediately stiffened. Her entire mind also seemed to have stilled at this moment. It was a long while later before she softly spoke the name, which was hidden deep in her memory, with some difficulty and disbelief…\\n\\n “Xiao… Xiao Yan?”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-996","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
