He let out a sigh of relief. It seemed that he was gradually absorbing the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood within his body… “This fellow is actually absorbing the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood?” Mu Qing Luan by the side was startled when she saw this scene. She immediately voiced her surprise. Feng zun-zhe slightly nodded. Although there was no change in Xiao Yan’s aura, he was still able to sense his strength increasing by relying on the sharp senses of of an elite Dou Zun. “The Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood does possess a great effect in raising the strength of a person’s body. However, once the body is unable to endure that kind of strengthening, it is likely that it will end up exploding.” Mu Qing Luan knit her eyebrows as she softly said. Lin Yan was startled when he heard this. Immediately, the expression in his eyes changed while he was looking at Xiao Yan. He hurriedly said, “It seems that something is not quite right…” Feng zun-zhe and Mu Qing Luan quickly turned their eyes to Xiao Yan when they heard his voice. They could see that Xiao Yan’s body was vaguely showing signs of swelling… “It is really the case of what I said coming true…” Mu Qing Luan bitterly laughed when she saw this scene. She sighed, “Xiao Yan’s body is unable to absorb so much Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood. This is the forewarning of the explosion of one’s body…” Feng zun-zhe’s expression changed slightly. He stepped forward and appeared beside Xiao Yan’s body. His hand was extended but it was hurriedly stopped by Mu Qing Luan by the side. “Currently, the interior of Xiao Yan’s body is in a full state. If any other energy is inserted, it is likely that his body will immediately burst apart.” Feng zun-zhe intently frowned. He said in a deep voice, “If this continues, he will sooner or later end up dying from his body bursting apart because of that Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood.” Mu Qing Luan bitterly laughed as she said, “No one knows if he has any other tactics. If we were to randomly intervene, it is likely that we will make matters worse.” Feng zun-zhe hesitated for a moment upon hearing this. All he could do, however, was to withdraw his hand. He looked at Xiao Yan’s swelling body, clenched his teeth, and said, “If he still doesn’t have any solution after some time, I can only intervene.” “Only the people from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribes possess the ability to completely absorb the bloodline strength within the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood. If they absorb it, they will be able to cause every part of their body or their bloodline to become even purer. However, if a human were to absorb it, the process will be filled with danger. I don’t know if I should say that this fellow is too bold or ignorant…” Mu Qing Luan nodded. Her eyes looked at Xiao Yan, who was continuing to swell, as she muttered to herself. The fierce wind eagle flapped its enormous wings, circling in the sky. The surrounding wild gale separated a great distance away, causing a quiet space to appear on the back of the enormous eagle. Feng zun-zhe and the two others were all focused on Xiao Yan’s swelling body. In less than ten breath’s time, Xiao Yan had actually transformed into a large fat person. The flesh all over his body appeared just like a balloon with air being blown in it as it bulged out. While Xiao Yan’s body was swelling in this manner, a painful expression had also covered his face. However, he had clenched his teeth and endured it. Feng zun-zhe’s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan’s swollen body. His fingers had already slowly curled involuntarily under his sleeves. Wave after wave of spiraling wind, that emitted some sharpness, appeared. “Hu…” Xiao Yan’s body had swelled to his limit within a couple of breath’s time. The small blood vessels on his skin had started to burst apart. Fresh blood seeped out, making him look like a terrifying blood person. Feng zun-zhe was unable to endure it any longer when he saw Xiao Yan in this state. He inhaled a deep breath of air and slowly raised his hand. A majestic natural energy agglomerated with lightning-like speed. He intended to force out the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood from within Xiao Yan’s body! Mu Qing Luan could only sigh softly when she saw that Feng zun-zhe was about to intervene. Thus, it was likely that Xiao Yan would suffer an extremely serious injury even if his life could be saved. Moreover, the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood could also be considered to have been completely wasted… The gathering of the energy became swifter and fiercer. An instant later, it was suddenly formed. Feng zun-zhe’s face was as deep as water. His sleeve was waved and was just about to transfer that energy into Xiao Yan’s body when he suddenly opened his eyes! Feng zun-zhe was startled when he saw Xiao Yan open his eyes. The majestic energy in his hand also stopped as a result. Xiao Yan, who had opened his eyes, swiftly formed some seals with his hands. Soon after, he let out a deep cry. A muffled sound could be heard by Feng zun-zhe and the two others as a pair of ten-foot-large gem-like bone wings swiftly spread apart. Xiao Yan’s body had strangely ceased swelling when the bone wings appeared. Wave after wave of green-red energy, visible to the naked eye, followed Xiao Yan’s skin and swiftly flowed. They poured into the bone wings on Xiao Yan’s back in a lightning-like manner! A strange scene appeared as this increasing amount of green-red energy poured into the bone wings. One could see that the crystal clear, jade-like bone wings began to slowly extend. Moreover, numerous unusual green-red lines spread through the empty bone wings. At a glance, they appeared like countless of tiny blood vessels… The green-red energy stretched the size of this pair of bone wings by over two times. Moreover, the dense green-red lines also caused the bone wings to possess a mysterious feeling. They were gently flapped as a low, deep sonic boom immediately resounded over the place. A wild wind also spread out. With the bone wings absorbing the overbearing, violent, green-red energy, Xiao Yan’s swelling body swiftly shrank. Within a short couple of breath’s time, he had returned to his normal size. Although his body was still covered with fresh blood, the painful expression on his face had gradually disappeared. Feng zun-zhe and the two others were a little stunned when they saw the enormous bone wings on Xiao Yan’s back, especially when they heard the sound made from its flapping. The shock on their faces became even denser. “This is… Heaven Demon Phoenix Wings?” Mu Qing Luan’s eyes stared at the pair of bone wings on Xiao Yan’s back. A moment later, she finally inhaled a breath of cold air as she uttered those words. “Yes, you should be right. Back then, I also saw some of the old demons from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe using them. Although this pair of wings belonging to Xiao Yan does not have any phoenix feathers, the scent on it is similar to that of the Heaven Demon Phoenix wings.” Feng zun-zhe slowly nodded. Even with his mental strength, his face involuntarily revealed some shock upon seeing that Xiao Yan possessed a pair of Heaven Demon Phoenix wings. “This fellow… don’t tell me he killed a member of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe? Otherwise, how is it possible for him to possess the Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood and this pair of Heaven Demon Phoenix wings? If the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe becomes aware of this, it is likely that they will dispatch experts to kill Xiao Yan.” Mu Qing Luan gradually withdrew the shock on her face as she muttered. Only now did she feel that this disciple of her teacher’s old friend, who had suddenly appeared, was very mysterious. Feng zun-zhe slightly nodded his head. He also found things to be a little troublesome. This little fellow was indeed quite bold. Even Yao Chen and him would have thought twice before touching someone from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. It was unexpected that this little fellow had not only removed the essence blood but had even created these bone wings. Xiao Yan’s tightly shut eyes twitched while the two of them were speaking. Soon after, Xiao Yan slowly opened them and saw Feng zun-zhe’s group who were looking at him. He bitterly laughed, “I’m sorry. I did not expect things to end up like this…” “Are you alright?” Feng zun-zhe shook his head and asked. Xiao Yan stood up and clenched his fist. A torrent-like overwhelming strength immediately surged through his limbs and bones. This kind of comfortable feeling of caused Xiao Yan to involuntarily let out a howl to the sky! The howl rumbled. There was a vague dragon roar and phoenix cry within it that shook one’s heart! “Phoenix cry? Dragon roar?” Feng zun-zhe’s heart immediately trembled when he heard this howl. His eyes were somewhat strange as he looked to Xiao Yan. He said, “Phoenix cry and dragon roar. These are top sonic waves in the world. If used together with a sonic wave Dou Technique, their strength will be extremely great. Unexpectedly, you possess both together…” Xiao Yan was similarly startled. That little dragon’s roar had originated from the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill back then. As for this phoenix cry… could it be because of that Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood? “You should hide these Heaven Demon Phoenix wings first. Try your best to avoid using them in the future. Otherwise, should the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe discover them, you will likely be faced with great trouble…” Feng zun-zhe reminded. Xiao Yan’s eyes rolled when he heard this. He was startled when he saw that the bone wings had transformed. The bone wings were gently flapped, and he could see wild wind surging from them. A low sonic boom was formed under the wings. It was just like the noise from a cannon that caused one to feel shaken. “The bone wings have become so much stronger. I think that their speed should have increased quite a lot. Looks like the remaining Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood has been absorbed by them…” joy surged in Xiao Yan’s heart as he sensed the strength of the current bone wings. If he were to use the Three Thousand Lightning Movement in addition, it was likely that even Fei Tian would no longer be able to catch up with him. A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s mind, returning the bone wings to his body. After which, he took out a cloth to wipe off the blood on his body. When he did so, he discovered that his skin radiated a faint green color. When his finger pressed his skin with great force, he felt a flexibility that was just like the skin of an animal. This caused Xiao Yan’s face to become stunned. “This skin of mine could likely even be compared with some Magical Beasts. This Ancient Phoenix Essence Blood is indeed good stuff for refining one’s flesh… if I take a little more, will it turn me into a Magical Beast?” Xiao Yan mocked. Although there was no increase in the Dou Qi, his physical body was much stronger than before. In other words, his endurance had also become much greater. If he were to fight head-on when battling others in the future, he would likely be able to gain a great advantage. Feng zun-zhe sighed in relief after seeing that Xiao Yan found nothing amiss during his detailed check of his body. Immediately, his eyes stared at Xiao Yan as he slowly said, “Little fellow, since you are fine, can you tell me where your teacher is?” Xiao Yan’s fist suddenly tightened when he heard this question from Feng zun-zhe.
