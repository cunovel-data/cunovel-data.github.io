A bitterness and sadness surfaced on his face. After a long time, he let out a gentle sigh.\\n\\n While Xiao Yan was staring at the ceiling in a daze, information suddenly swarmed into his mind. However, he did not feel any panic because of this. Lying on the bed, Xiao Yan allowed the information to pour into his mind as it pleased. It was a long while later before he began reading this last bit of help Yao Lao had prepared for him before Yao Lao’s fall into slumber.\\n\\n Xiao Yan slowly finished looking through the recuperation program in detail. At the end of the information, there was a medicinal formula for a tier five medicinal pill named ‘Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill’. Clearly, Yao Lao was worried that once he had fallen into a slumber, Xiao Yan would not be able to suppress Hai Bo Dong with his own strength. Therefore, he had specially transferred the medicinal formula, allowing Xiao Yan to do his best to search for the necessary medicinal ingredients within a year in order to reassure Hai Bo Dong.\\n\\n “Teacher, rest assured that I will think of ways to allow you to quickly recover your Spiritual Strength.” This information that was filled with Yao Lao’s effort and concern had caused Xiao Yan’s nose to feel sore. His fist tightened as he softly mumbled the words.\\n\\n Inhaling a deep breath of air that contained the scent of sandalwood, Xiao Yan’s feelings gradually calmed down. His head rolled as he thought deeply.\\n\\n Now that Yao Lao had fallen into a slumber, he would have to rely on himself for everything. Having lost Yao Lao as his trump card, Xiao Yan had also lost the ability to suppress Hai Bo Dong. Although Hai Bo Dong’s body contained the hidden flame poison that Yao Lao had left behind, that thing was something that only Yao Lao could activate. Now that Yao Lao had fallen into a deep slumber, it had become totally useless.\\n\\n As for that ‘Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill’, it was a tier five medicinal pill. Xiao Yan’s ability was insufficient to refine it. Therefore, even this last condition that could keep Hai Bo Dong in check had also lost its effectiveness.\\n\\n If the knowledge of him having lost these few restraints was to be obtained by Hai Bo Dong, it was likely that the one year agreement would be forcefully written off. There was also the possibility that Hai Bo Dong would also forcefully snatch back the map fragment from his hands.\\n\\n Although his conjecture was a little rough, Xiao Yan was clear that their cooperation had always been built upon the precondition that both parties strengths were not far apart. Regardless of what happened, Xiao Yan without Yao Lao acting as a protector would have to plan for the worst case scenario.\\n\\n Currently, with his own strength, Xiao Yan could only take out the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame\u0027. Although Yao Lao had said that he had left some ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ in the storage ring for Xiao Yan to use, Xiao Yan did not have the courage to use the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ that required two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ for a second time after having tried it once. After all, that was far too terrifying. During the first time, Xiao Yan was able to have the protection of Yao Lao, but what about the second time? If something bad were to happen, he might really be burned to death by the very technique that he had created…\\n\\n Thinking about all the numerous troubles Yao Lao’s slumber had brought, Xiao Yan felt a headache as he shook his head. However, after thinking deeply into this manner, he had firmly remembered the few things that he needed to do.\\n\\n The first was that no matter what happened, he must not let Hai Bo Dong know that he could no longer possess the strength of a Dou Huang. At the same time, he also must not let Hai Bo Dong know that he no longer had the ability to refine the ‘Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill’.\\n\\n Second, he must think of everything to search for natural and unique things that could swiftly recover Spiritual Strength. As long as Yao Lao could once again awaken, then these latent problems would not be able to erupt.\\n\\n After firmly remembering these two most important things that must be done in his heart, Xiao Yan sighed in relief. He struggled to sit up and leaned gently on the bedrest. His palm opened and an icy cold smooth thing suddenly coiled around his hand.\\n\\n Being twined around by this icy cold smooth thing, Xiao Yan’s heart trembled as he was caught off guard. His left hand roughly pulled aside the blanket.\\n\\n Once the blanket was pulled open, a small cute looking seven-colored snake was seen twining around his arm. Seeming to sense the light being shined upon it, it lifted its long neck. Its pale-purple snake eyes stared blankly at Xiao Yan. A moment later, an affection surfaced within the snake’s eyes and it could not help but use its head to rub against Xiao Yan’s arm.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes watched this ‘Heavenly Swallowing Python’. Due to its evolution, its seven-colored body which he noticed had become a much deeper color compared to before. When he saw the extremely human-like affection in its eyes, Xiao Yan’s heart, which had become much heavier after Yao Lao fell into a deep slumber, suddenly became much more relaxed. A brilliant and unrestrained joy swarmed onto his face. He carefully carried the seven-colored small snake with both hands. He parted his mouth, let out a smile and gave it a big kiss. In a soft voice, he said, “Good Darling, you have woken up at the most appropriate time…”\\n\\n Yao Lao had told him before that the ‘Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’ would have the strength to contend with a Dou Wang after this evolution. Although this may still have some distance to a Dou Huang, Xiao Yan did not forget that within the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’, there was an even more terrifying spirit, Queen Medusa!\\n\\n Although currently Queen Medusa could not appear because she was suppressed by the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’s’ consciousness, Xiao Yan clearly understood that once the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’s’ life was threatened, the terrifying woman who had once sealed Hai Bo Dong for decades would once again break through the suppression of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ and forcefully control its body!\\n\\n Therefore, as long as Xiao Yan was able to groom his relationship with the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ to an extremely intimate one, the Queen Medusa in the body of the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ would be his lifesaver if Hai Bo Dong was to really turn on him abruptly in the future or if he was to be in a juncture where death was imminent.\\n\\n Thinking of the importance the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ was to him in the future, the eyes that Xiao Yan used to look at it obviously became even warmer. His palm gently rubbed its smooth scales as he took out a bottle of ‘Amethyst Winged Lion Birth Essence’.\\n\\n Seeing the appearance of the ‘Amethyst Winged Lion Birth Essence’, the pale-purple eyes of the ‘Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python’ immediately became bright. Its tail repeatedly rubbed against Xiao Yan as its mouth emitted urgent hissing entreating sounds.\\n\\n Seeing that the temptation of the ‘Amethyst Winged Lion Birth Essence’ had grown instead of weakened, Xiao Yan sighed in complete relief. At the same time, his heart somewhat rejoiced. If it were not for the lucky fact that he possessed the food that this kind of ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ liked the most, it was likely that it would be much more difficult for him to have such an intimate relationship with it.\\n\\n Xiao Yan carefully used a small jade rod which was hollow at its center to suck up a few drops of Amethyst Essence. After which, he poured it into the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’s’ mouth. He eyed the cute manner in which the python sucked the essence with its eyes closed and could not help but smile. He then returned the Amethyst Essence properly and placed the satisfied ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ by the side of his pillow. After musing for a moment, he took out a low-grade healing medicine which had very gentle medicinal properties and slowly swallowed it. He then closed his eyes and felt the gentle energy that was being spread throughout his body. The corner of his mouth twitched slightly. Although this pure energy was extremely gentle, when it was repairing his nearly dilapidated Qi Paths, waves of twitching pain were still emitted.\\n\\n Xiao Yan could only bitterly smile and shake his head at the extent of fragility that his Qi Paths were currently in. He allowed that gentle energy to completely exhaust itself and a little more energy slowly appeared in his body.\\n\\n When Xiao Yan had his eyes closed, the ‘Ka Cha’ sound from the opening of the room door suddenly sounded in the room. A few human figures who were conversing something in soft voices walked in softly. Upon seeing Xiao Yan who had sat up on the bed, they were momentarily lost. Immediately, they pounced over with wild joy visible on their faces.\\n\\n “Xiao-Yan-Zi, you have finally woken up. You were already unconscious for five days.” Xiao Li who was the fastest to rush over let out a loud and happy laughter.\\n\\n “Has it really been five days?” Hearing this, Xiao Yan stilled. Immediately, he laughed bitterly and shook his head.\\n\\n “Are you alright?” Xiao Ding smiled and walked forward. His gaze was filled with joy as he inquired.\\n\\n “For the time being, I won’t die.” Xiao Yan pulled the corner of his mouth and replied with a smile.\\n\\n “This Little Fellow really hides his true skill. I didn’t expect that you would actually kill the First Elder of the Mo clan.” Xiao Li patted Xiao Yan’s thigh and laughed.\\n\\n “Haha, it was old sir Hai who told us. But only us two brothers know about this. We did not spread what we heard to anyone else.” When Xiao Ding who was standing to the side saw Xiao Yan’s surprise, he pointed at the smiling but silent Hai Bo Dong and explained.\\n\\n “Old Hai, thank you very much. If you had not rescued me this time around, I might really have died.” Xiao Yan stared deeply at the old man behind Xiao Ding. Without Yao Lao as his trump card, Xiao Yan had for the first time, realized that a Dou Huang was actually able to give others such a strong pressure.\\n\\n “Hehe, it’s something that required only little effort. But Brother Xiao Yan really caused me to feel some admiration. The explosion that you created that day, tsk tsk, is far too terrifying.” Hai Bo Dong simply smiled and waved his hands when faced with Xiao Yan’s thanks. He then raised his thumb toward Xiao Yan. The admiration in his laughter was not an act.\\n\\n “It is just that my head suddenly became heated.” Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and shook his head.\\n\\n “I know that at that time, your mind was heated. A normal person would definitely not do something like that.” Hai Bo Dong joked. His gaze swept on Xiao Yan’s body and said with a frown, “Your injuries appear to be quite serious, no?”\\n\\n “Haha, as long as I still have a breath remaining, I will be able to let myself become even more tenacious than a cockroach.” Xiao Yan laughed faintly.\\n\\n “You are even able to possess two of those kinds of things. I do not doubt you when you say this.” Seeing Xiao Yan\u0027s unconcerned manner with regards to his injuries, Hai Bo Dong nodded his head. This guy really had too many hidden cards.\\n\\n After saying some polite words to Hai Bong Dong, Xiao Yan turned his head around and recited ten plus medicinal ingredients to Xiao Li and Xiao Ding. He then told them to quickly help him gather them. Once he sent off the both of them with his eyes, Xiao Yan once again turned his gaze to Hai Bo Dong. He smiled slightly and took out a pen and paper from his storage ring. Under Hai Bo Dong’s uncertain gaze, he wrote a few names which at a glance, one would know that they were rare medicinal ingredients.\\n\\n “Old Hai, with this favor for saving me, I no longer need to be so formal with you. These few medicinal ingredients are the main medicinal ingredients needed to refine ‘Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill’. I will hand them to you. Anytime that you manage to luckily find any of them, think of every way to get your hands on them. Once you have found all of the medicinal ingredients, I will start helping you refine them.” Xiao Yan handed the paper to Hai Bo Dong as he smiled and said.\\n\\n Hearing this, Hai Bo Dong was momentarily at a loss. Quickly following was an unrestrained joy that surfaced on his old face. His hands trembled slightly as he received the piece of paper. He carefully remembered all the medicinal ingredients written on it before seriously keeping the piece of paper. He cupped his hands, shook them at Xiao Yan and sincerely said, “Brother Xiao Yan, having you treat me with such honesty, the old me is extremely gratefully. Since I, Hai Bo Dong, have said that I will protect you for a year, I will definitely keep my promise. You can recuperate at ease. During this period of time, even if the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect comes, the old me will continue to defend you!”\\n\\n Eyeing Hai Bo Dong whose pride was soaring, Xiao Yan nodded his head. His decision to give several of the medicinal ingredients’ names from the medicinal formula to Hai Bo Dong was indeed quite a good choice. He was able to appease Hai Bo Dong and was also able to obtain some trust from him.\\n\\n “Next, I will need to use all my strength to recuperate. It won’t be long until the trip to the Misty Cloud Sect which is only two months away…” Xiao Yan softly muttered in his heart as he leaned gently on the bedrest.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-265","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
