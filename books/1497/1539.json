Its terrifying temperature caused the originally moist land to dry and even began to crack apart. Other than some elite Dou Shengs, no one else dared to step within ten thousand feet from the Fallen Peak…\\n\\n “The chief of the Hall of Souls has actually been defeated…”\\n\\n The entire mountain range became completely silent as they watched this firestorm sweep through the sky. After being struck head-on by such a ferocious attack, even if the chief of the Hall of Souls could retain his life, he would not be in a good state. It was likely that the victor had been decided.\\n\\n A grave expression surged in the eyes of many people after experiencing this thought. The chief of the Hall of Souls had been a renowned peak expert within the Central Plains for a long time. His fierce reputation had caused many factions to tremble upon hearing his name, establishing the Hall of Souls as the overlord of the region. Now, however, this expert, who had once stirred a bloody storm across the Central Plains, had been defeated by the hands of an up and coming member of the younger generation.\\n\\n After this battle, the name of both Xiao Yan and the Sky Mansion Alliance would undoubtedly become extremely dazzling across the Central Plains.\\n\\n “This lad is extraordinary. The position of the overlord of the Central Plains will likely change.”\\n\\n The Grand Elders and experts of some factions felt such a thought flash through their hearts. They looked at a certain figure in the sky and an additional solemness and respect was present in their eyes. The strong were forever honored in this world!\\n\\n The many experts from the Sky Mansion Alliance on the Fallen Mountain revealed joy on their faces at this moment. Their eyes were filled with pride as they stared at the skinny figure in the sky. The reason Xiao Yan was able to possess such a great reputation within the Sky Mansion Alliance was because of the many battles he had experienced. After this battle today, his status as the spiritual leader of the Sky Mansion Alliance was sealed!\\n\\n If the result of the battle today were to be transmitted back to the Sky Mansion, there was no telling what kind of a commotion it would stir. Everyone understood the meaning of this battle. From today on, if one were to rank the factions of the Central Plains, this ‘one mansion’ would be ranked above the ‘one hall’!\\n\\n In the future, the overlord of the Central Plains would be the Sky Mansion Alliance!\\n\\n Compared to the joy on the Sky Mansion’s side, the Hall of Souls was completely silent. Those experts faced each other. They were all a little absent-minded. Not long ago, the mighty reputation of the Hall of Souls still existed within the Central Plains. Any expert who heard this name would reveal a face covered with fear and horror, yet within these short few years… the overlord, who possessed a reputation that had once caused one’s expression to change, had tasted the bitterness of defeat for the first time.\\n\\n “I want to see how you will explain this to the clan!”\\n\\n Old Man Hun Mo revealed a volatile expression. Those surrounding gazes were extremely irritating. He swung his sleeve and furiously cried out.\\n\\n “The one who laughs last is the true victor. If we did not even possess patience, our Hun clan would have long since disappeared from this world.” Hun Qian Mo’s expression might appear a little sinister, but he still remained indifferent. He coldly glanced at Old Man Hun Mo and chided him.\\n\\n Old Man Hun Mo’s mouth opened upon hearing this scolding. However, he quickly shut his mouth. His face was filled with the dissatisfaction he felt.\\n\\n Hun Qian Mo’s eyes were dark and cold. The shriveled fist under his sleeve was tightly clenched. “You can all rejoice. Once my Hun clan’s plans begin, the Sky Mansion Alliance will be completely annihilated with a flick of his finger…”\\n\\n A countless number of people below had various thoughts lingering in their hearts. The firestorm in the sky slowly scattered. A charred black figure shot out from of the storm. That completely black figure was covered with many ferocious looking wounds. It was even vaguely possible to see some pulsing inner organs. His aura was so weak that it was almost impossible to detect. Clearly, he had suffered an extremely serious injury.\\n\\n “Chief of the Hall of Souls…”\\n\\n Everyone felt their hearts tense upon seeing the figure. This miserable appearance was naturally the chief of the Hall of Souls, who had been ruthlessly struck. From his appearance, it was obvious that he no longer had any ability to fight.\\n\\n At this moment, some of the experts from the Hall of Souls, who had been holding out for a miracle, felt completely hopeless.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, this chief will not forget this grudge!”\\n\\n The chief of the Hall of Souls slowly landed on the ground in a weak manner. However, he struggled to open both of his blurry eyes. A hoarse and weak voice was slowly emitted before being transmitted into Xiao Yan’s ear.\\n\\n From the sky, Xiao Yan’s indifferent eyes stared at the chief of the Hall of Souls, who had suddenly landed. A cold glint flashed within his eyes. One should get rid of a problem at its roots. This chief of the Hall of Souls might be seriously injured not, but with the skills of the Hun clan, he would probably be lively again after resting for a couple of months. At that time, he might be able to command the Hall of Souls into causing some trouble. This was something that Xiao Yan did not like to see.\\n\\n “Since, you have been defeated, you should leave your life behind!”\\n\\n A murderous intent surged within Xiao Yan’s heart. He moved and descended toward the chief of the Hall of Souls with lightning-like speed in front of many pairs of eyes. From his surging murderous intent, it was obvious that he was intending to deliver a final blow while his opponent was down.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, how dare you!”\\n\\n This sudden unexpected change also startled the members from the Hall of Souls. They did not expect Xiao Yan to be this ruthless. Not only had he won, he was also planning to kill.\\n\\n “Hmph, you should repay some of the blood debt you owe to my Xiao clan!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan completely ignored those cries. His body flashed and appeared above the head of the chief of the Hall of Souls. His palm furiously slammed toward the top of the chief’s head. From the looks of his sharp palm wind, the chief’s head would definitely split like a watermelon if struck.\\n\\n The eyes of the seriously injured chief of the Hall of Souls, who was paralyzed, revealed a horror in the face of death after seeing the palm wind falling from above his head.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, you are seeking death!”\\n\\n A furious thunder-like cry suddenly rumbled beside Xiao Yan’s ear just as his palm was about to strike the Hall of Souls’ chief’s head. The space around Xiao Yan’s body became distorted. Hun Qian Mo appeared with a gloomy expression. His shriveled fist was clenched as it smashed toward Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed. From the looks of it, he was intending to force Xiao Yan to stop his attack.\\n\\n “Hmph!”\\n\\n A cold glint flashed across Xiao Yan as Hun Qian Mo attacked. His palm wind did not weaken. A thought passed through his mind and Little Yi appeared on his shoulder. Little Yi waved his small hand and many fire lotuses quickly flew forward. After which, they collided with Hun Qian Mo’s hand.\\n\\n “Bang bang!”\\n\\n A hot fire wave swiftly spread from the explosion. However, that shriveled fist penetrated the fire wave and smashed into Xiao Yan’s chest with lightning-like speed.\\n\\n “Grug!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood after suffering a serious injury. Hun Qian Mo’s punch contained the desire to kill. Fortunately, there was some fire lotuses obstructed it. Hence, it was not fatal despite injuring Xiao Yan. Moreover, Xiao Yan’s palm had still managed to ruthlessly smash into the head of the chief of the Hall of Souls when Hun Qian Mo’s punch landed on his body.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s palm contained an extremely great strength. Hence, the chief of the Hall of Souls’ head was blasted into a bloody mist. Additionally, the lingering force wildly roamed around his body and blasted it into a complete mess.\\n\\n Xiao Yan did not continue to observe the body after managing to strike his target. He swallowed the blood in his mouth and quickly withdrew.\\n\\n “Bastard!”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s body had just pulled back when Hun Qian Mo discovered that the chief of the Hall of Souls’ body had been blasted into a complete mess. His eyes turned crimson. A roar that was filled with murderous intent reverberated around the sky. He lifted his head and glared at Xiao Yan. His hand grabbed across the distance and the space where Xiao Yan was flying collapsed, sealing Xiao Yan in the process.\\n\\n “Die!”\\n\\n Hun Qian Mo’s body flashed after sealing the space around Xiao Yan. His face was filled with a ferocity as he appeared in front of Xiao Yan.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s eyes were sinister as they stared at the ferocious Hun Qian Mo. A thought passed through his heart and the Extermination Fire Lotus began to gather in his palm under his sleeve…\\n\\n “Hun Qian Mo, deaths and injuries are unavoidable during a battle. You should not break the rules…”\\n\\n The green-clothed figure slowly appeared in front of Xiao Yan just as Xiao Yan was about to unleash the Extermination Fire Lotus on this old demon. A calm voice followed. It was the ancestor from the Pill Tower.\\n\\n “Old ghost, are you really planning to completely oppose my Hun clan?” Hun Qian Mo’s eyes were dense as he stared at the ancestor from the Pill Tower before uttering each word with a pause.\\n\\n “Hun Qian Mo, it is pointless to threaten me…” The ancestor from the Pill Tower merely smiled before giving a reply after hearing Hun Qian Mo’s threat.\\n\\n Hun Qian Mo’s shriveled face twitched. He was aware that it was impossible for him to kill Xiao Yan today with the ancestor from the Pill Tower obstructing him. His eyes gloomily glanced at Xiao Yan. His hoarse voice was filled with a murderous desire, “Xiao Yan… it is not easy to kill a member of my Hun clan. Your fate will definitely be a hundred times more miserable than Xiao Xuan in the future!”\\n\\n “Thank you for informing me.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan coldly laughed. It was not the first time he had heard such words from a member of the Hun clan.\\n\\n “Hmph, the next time we battle, your Sky Mansion Alliance will be exterminated!”\\n\\n Hun Qian Mo swung his sleeves. He gave a dense cold smile before turning around and rushing back to the chief of the Hall of Souls’ exploded body. A black fog surged from his hand, and he absorbed the shattered soul of the chief into the fog. After which, he landed on the ground with a dark and solemn expression. He did not speak. Instead, his body moved and he rushed out of the Fallen Mountain Range. Those experts from the Hall of Souls could only follow behind him in a dejected manner.\\n\\n “Unfortunately, I was unable to completely incinerate the chief of the Hall of Souls’ soul…” Xiao Yan grinned as the members of the Hall of Souls left. He felt somewhat regretful. That old fellow had managed to collect the remains of the soul of the chief of the Hall of Souls. Given the abilities of the Hun clan, it might be possible to revive him.\\n\\n “You are too greedy… the Hun clan is not as easy to deal with as you imagine.”\\n\\n The ancestor of the Pill Tower turned around. He stared at Xiao Yan before he shook his head and softly laughed, “I never believed that anyone would be able to deal with the Hall of Souls in the past. However, I am beginning to believe it slightly at this moment. This descendant of the Xiao clan might really be able to achieve the ambition that Xiao Xuan was unable to complete back then…”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1539","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
