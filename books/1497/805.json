{"id":47439,"no":805,"title":"Chapter 805: Capture!","content":"Chapter 805: Capture!\n “Bang!”\n An earth-shaking explosion suddenly resounded over the sky. At that moment, the entire Sky Scorpion Mountain Range violently trembled because of it. Some of the weaker people from both sides were shaken by this sudden thunder-like roar until threads of blood seeped from their ears.\n The enormous seven colored energy agglomerated in the sky like clouds. Finally, it slowly scattered. The space was just like that of the surface of a calm lake after an enormous rock was thrown into it, stirring up a storm. On top of it, waves of visible energy ripples seeped out.\n Xiao Yan paused in the sky while being supported by Zi Yan. The ‘Sea Flipping Seal’ from earlier had nearly exhausted all the Dou Qi within his body. Fortunately, the usage of the ‘God Seal Skill’ did not pose much requirements on his Spiritual Strength. Hence, the kind of dizzy condition after using the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ did not appear.\n Despite this, Xiao Yan’s current condition was not good. His face was pale and his aura was weary. It was still somewhat hard for him to use the ‘Sea Flipping Skill’ with his current strength.\n At this moment, Xiao Yan’s and Zi Yan’s eyes were focused on the seven colored energy in the sky that had scattered. Protector Tie had firmly received such a fierce strike from Medusa, and it was likely that his situation would not be good. Regardless of what happened, Xiao Yan possessed the thought that this fellow must die. Moreover, he had even recognized the ‘God Seal Skill’ that he had used. In order to avoid some trouble in the future, this fellow must not be allowed to leave!\n A dense killing intent flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as this thought appeared across his heart. He must not allow this person to remain!\n The seven colored energy gradually spread under a countless number of gazes. At a certain moment, the rainbow like seven colored energy suddenly fluctuated. A miserable black figure immediately rushed out.\n The black figure fled toward the northern sky with all his might the moment he appeared. Taking in his miserable appearance, he no longer possessed even a little of the prestige from earlier. Clearly, this Protector of the ‘Hall of Souls’ had already lost the right to be arrogant after suffering repeated setbacks.\n Medusa, who had been observing the vicinity, sensed Protector Tie the moment the latter appeared. She merely laughed when she saw Protector Tie’s fleeing manner. Her body moved and she transformed into a seven colored glow that shot forth before appearing in front of Protector Tie within a couple of flashes.\n “I am someone from the ‘Hall of Souls’. The ‘Hall of Souls’ will not let you off if you kill me!”\n Protector Tie hurriedly reduced his speed. He put up a bold front as he cried out sternly the moment he saw Medusa.\n At this moment, the black fog surrounding Protector Tie was extremely thin. His aura was similar to Xiao Yan’s aura, where it was weary until an extremely weak degree. Clearly, the powerful strike by Medusa earlier had given this expert from the ‘Hall of Souls’ a heavy blow.\n Medusa’s eyes were ice-cold as they swept over Protector Tie. A faint ridicule surfaced in her eyes as she coldly laughed, “A dog that has lost its home…”\n “Alright, alright, since you are unwilling to give up, this protector will fight with you until the both of us suffer!” Protector Tie angrily roared out upon being ridiculed by Medusa. Black fog swiftly brewed from his body. However, just as everyone thought that this fellow was about to unleash his final attack, his body suddenly turned, and he began to flee in another direction with the help of the black fog’s cover.\n Medusa’s eyes mockingly observed the fleeing Protector Tie. She shook her head, clenched her delicate hand and a powerful suction forced suddenly erupted from her palm. Under this suction force, the latter’s fleeing speed was instantly reduced. Medusa’s body moved and appeared behind him before viciously delivering a palm to his back.\n Protector Tie staggered back upon being struck by the palm. The black fog on his body became even thinner. Currently, it was likely that even an expert Dou Huang could easily finish him…\n Medusa let out a cold laugh after seriously injuring Protector Tie. She extended her delicate hand and a powerful seven colored energy surged out, completely wrapping around Protector Tie like an energy cover.\n The seven colored energy was like a lock that sealed Protector Tie within.Protector Tie had difficulty breaking the energy layer regardless of how he struggled. Hence, he could only emit a furious roar like that of a trapped beast.\n Medusa’s body moved while her delicate hand was holding onto the energy layer. She appeared in front of Xiao Yan within a couple of flashes.\n “This fellow’s injuries are too serious. He basically doesn’t have much to retaliate with now. He is indeed much easier to deal with compared to that Protector Wu.” Medusa dragged the energy layer in front of her, looked at Protector Tie within, and softly spoke.\n Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he saw that this fellow did not escape. He had finally settled this fellow from the ‘Hall of Souls’ after spending so much effort.\n “It is just that I did not expect this fellow to possess the strength to scream despite being so seriously injured.” Medusa glanced at Protector Tie within the energy layer with some surprise. Her brows were slightly knit before her delicate hand moved. The energy layer swiftly shrank before finally adhering to Protector Tie’s body. A ‘chi chi’ sound immediately appeared and the mouth of that Protector Tie emitted numerous sharp sounds.\n Following the erosion of that seven colored energy, the black fog on Protector Tie’s body grew increasingly thinner. A moment later, it completely disappeared. With the disappearance of this black fog that covered his exterior, the body of Protector Tie was finally revealed!\n A somewhat illusionary spiritual body slowly drifted within the energy layer. However, this spiritual body appeared somewhat illusionary and transparent. It seemed to have entered a seriously injured state…\n Xiao Yan and Medusa were stunned when they saw the original body of this expert protector from the ‘Hall of Souls’.\n “A spiritual body?” Xiao Yan was somewhat astounded as he studied the weak spirit of Protector Tie. No one expected this expert from the ‘Hall of Souls,’ who was comparable to that of someone from the Dou Zong class, to actually be a spiritual body.\n “What is happening? Don’t tell me that we have captured the wrong person?” Medusa was also extremely surprised as she said.\n “No, that should not be the case…” Xiao Yan shook his head while wearing a solemn expression. He said, “Since the ‘Hall of Souls’ uses soul in its name and the targets that it captures are powerful spiritual bodies, this mysterious ‘Hall of Souls’ should have a great relationship with souls. Perhaps… some of the experts from the ‘Hall of Souls’ are originally spiritual bodies…”\n “For example, the Protector Wu from the last time… ultimately never revealed his original body, hidden in the black fog…”\n Medusa slightly frowned upon hearing this deduction by Xiao Yan. She clarified, “You mean that the ‘Hall of Souls’ uses spiritual bodies to deal with spiritual bodies?”\n “Yes, there is a good chance of this. Ordinary Dou Qi is unable to cause a fatal blow to a spiritual body. If one wants to capture or deal with other spiritual bodies, the best hunter would be spiritual bodies who are in a similar state…” Xiao Yan spoke with a solemn expression.\n “The ‘Hall of Souls’ will not let all of you off for killing me!” Protector Tie’s eyes were fierce as he defied Xiao Yan and Medusa. Even though he had recently fallen into their hands, his tone was still quite aggressive.\n “Relax, I will not kill you. I still have many things that I wish to learn from you…” Xiao Yan’s hand extended into the energy layer. He touched the spirit Protector Tie without the slightest fear while speaking with a smile.\n A denseness flashed across Protector Tie’s eyes when he saw that Xiao Yan was actually so bold. He flicked his finger and a black colored chain, that had shrunk a lot, strangely appeared before shooting toward Xiao Yan’s hand.\n “Hmph!”\n Xiao Yan let out a cold snort upon seeing this action of Protector Tie. He flicked his finger and an invisible flame suddenly appeared in his palm. It shot toward Protector Tie.\n The ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ swiftly shot over before colliding with Protector Tie’s spiritual body.\n A dense white smoke and ‘chi chi’ sound suddenly appeared on the surface of Protector Tie’s body when the invisible flame made contact with the latter’s spirit. A sharp cry containing a bone deep pain resounded from his mouth.\n “Dammit, what kind of flame is this? It is actually able to harm a spiritual body?”\n Xiao Yan smiled and nodded only after seeing Protector Tie leaping up and down while being burned by that cluster of ‘Fallen Heart Flame’. It seemed that this ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ was indeed able to harm a spiritual body. It was possible to harm a spiritual body as long as the energy or Dou Qi reached a certain degree of strength, but there was no doubt that the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ was the one that could be considered the thing that a spiritual body was extremely afraid of or even terrified of.\n The originally seriously injured Protector Tie suffered additional injuries while being burned by the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’. His spirit was almost a transparent state. From the looks of it, he could be turned into a cluster of nothingness at any moment.\n Xiao Yan waved his hand upon seeing that Protector Tie was about to turn into nothingness. That cluster of ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ slowly disappeared. A jade bottle was immediately taken out from his storage ring. With a wave of his hand, a suction force stuffed Protector Tie’s spirit into the jade bottle. After which, an invisible flame slowly rose on his finger as it circled once around the surface of the jade bottle. Finally, the flame was used to seal the bottle’s mouth.\n “I will let him stay in it first. I will interrogate him about information regarding the ‘Hall of Souls’ once the matter here is settled.”\n Xiao Yan sighed in relief only after storing the jade bottle in his Storage Ring. As long as he captured this fellow, his aim for this trip had been successfully achieved. Moreover, now that he was aware that it was possible that some of the experts from the ‘Hall of Souls’ were spiritual bodies, the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ in Xiao Yan’s hand might well cause those fellows to truly suffer great losses.\n “Are you alright?” Medusa knit her brows and inquired upon seeing Xiao Yan’s pale-white face that contained a smile.\n “Ke ke, it is just that too much of the Dou Qi within me has been exhausted. I didn’t receive any injuries. As long as I rest a little, I will be able to recover…” Xiao Yan smiled and shook her head. His eyes studied Medusa before softly saying, “Thank you very much.”\n “If you had not exhausted him, it would not have been possible for me to subdue him so easily.” Medusa slightly turned her head away and randomly spoke while she was under the focus of Xiao Yan’s eyes.\n Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he heard this. If Medusa had not delayed him earlier, where would he have found the time to use the ‘Sea Flipping Seal,’ a Dou Skill he was not familiar with?\n Xiao Yan thought of this in his heart. He was about to speak when his face suddenly changed. His head was abruptly lifted, and his eyes moved to the grayish-purple colour space cage which had been void of activity for a long time. Some unusual fluctuations suddenly appeared there.\n “Is the victor about to be decided?”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-805","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
