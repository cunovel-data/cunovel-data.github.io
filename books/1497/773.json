He said, “You are finally here.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor moved her body and it gently landed on the mountain peak. Her unusual grayish-purple pupils that appeared demon-like under the moonlight first glanced at Medusa behind Xiao Yan before calmly speaking, “There is quite a lot of trouble for the three armies to retreat. Those armies have argued too much and delayed quite a lot of time.”\\n\\n “Why?” Xiao Yan frowned when he heard this. He asked, “Are the three sects unwilling to withdraw?”\\n\\n “The Chu Yun Empire is controlled by the Poison Sect. I am the Poison Sect’s leader so it is only natural that the Chu Yun Empire will not voice too many objections. However, the Golden Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley are not factions from the Chu Yun Empire. The strength of their sects is not much weaker than the Poison Sect. Hence, their objection is extremely intense even though I said that I wanted to withdraw. They had long planned on annexing the Jia Ma Empire and were naturally unwilling to let go of this chance so easily.” Little Fairy Doctor slowly explained.\\n\\n “Luo Yan Tian and one of the three Mulan Elders are seriously wounded by me. They actually dare to be this arrogant despite having lost these two people?” A coldness flashed through Xiao Yan’s eyes as he spoke.\\n\\n “I said that the Golden Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley’s strength are quite strong. Although they dispatched the strongest people in their sect for this big battle, they still have not touched the essence of their strength. From the looks of it, they still intend on stubbornly destroying the Jia Ma Empire even if the Poison Sect refuses to join this battle.” Little Fairy Dcotor looked at Xiao Yan as she once again said, “Yan Luo Tian and one of the three Mulan Elders have indeed been seriously injured. However, according to what I know, their sects possess quite high tier alchemists. As long as they are given a couple of day’s time for the sect to deliver some rare medicinal pills over, their injuries likely will recover extremely quickly. Adding this to the large number of experts from the two sects who will arrive, it is likely that they will gather and attack the Jia Ma at that time.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s face was dark and solemn. If this were the case, the Yan Alliance and the Jia Ma Empire would likely descend into a bitter battle. This kind of situation was clearly not one that he was willing to see.\\n\\n “The greatest support of the Gold Geese Sect and the Mulan Valley are the two elite Dou Zongs who are namely Yan Luo Tian as well as the three Mulan Elders. As long as these two people are killed, the strength of the two large factions will naturally decline. They would also no longer dare to possess the thought of attacking the Jia Ma Empire.” Medusa by the side suddenly spoke in an indifferent manner.\\n\\n Xiao Yan was slightly startled when he heard this. His eyes immediately narrowed as a cold glint flashed. Medusa’s words were indeed true. Currently, Yan Luo Tian and one of the three Mulan Elders were seriously injured. It was the best opportunity to kill them off. Otherwise, once they recovered their strength, they would become extremely troublesome again. One must not possess the slightest soft-hearted feelings when facing an enemy. Otherwise, the Yan Alliance would have to pay an unknown great price for when the enemy returned in the future.\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s gaze was thrown toward the Little Fairy Doctor just as this thought flashed past his heart. If she were to step out and stop them from killing Luo Yan Tian and the three Mulan Elders, it was likely that their plan would have difficulty coming to fruition.\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor raised her brows slightly while she watched Xiao Yan’s eyes. She subsequently descended deep into thought.\\n\\n Medusa behind Xiao Yan moved her body while Little Fairy Doctor was deep in thought. She appeared in the air and coincidentally sealed off Little Fairy Doctor’s path of retreat. From the looks of her actions, it seemed that she was prepared to immediately act depending on the Little Fairy Doctor’s decision.\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor had naturally sensed Medusa’s action. She coldly laughed, “If I wish to leave, you will not be able to stop me.”\\n\\n “You can come and try.” Medusa’s eyes also revealed a chillness as she spoke in a tit for tat manner.\\n\\n Xiao Yan felt a great headache as he watched these two women who were filled with fury when they were near each other. He waved his hand and stopped the two of them. His eyes studied the Little Fairy Doctor as he said, “The Yan Alliance is established by me. Hence, I cannot watch it be destroyed. Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders will be the greatest threat. Hence, it will naturally be best if it is possible to finish them off.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor hesitated for a moment as she observed Xiao Yan’s flickering eyes. She clenched her silver teeth and nodded. She said, “In any case, those two fellow have ill thoughts toward me and cannot be considered true allies. I can choose not to intervene if you wish to attack.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan immediately sighed in relief when he heard this. His face had a joy that was difficult to hide. For the Little Fairy Doctor to be able to say this, it meant that she had not forgotten about their relationship. Moreover, from her point of view, this was a friendship that was rare. Even though they were now in different camps, she still quietly valued it.\\n\\n The cold glint in Medusa’s eyes gradually paled only after seeing Little Fairy Doctor nod her head. She slowly lowered her body and mumbled, “Consider yourself sensible.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor naturally ignored Medusa’s words. Her grayish-purple eyes turned to Xiao Yan as she said, “The three armies are now temporarily staying at a city on the borders of the Chu Yun Empire. Luo Yan Tian and the three Mulan Elders are also there. However, two of them are seriously injured. Hence, the surrounding defenses are extremely tight. It will not be easy for the two of you to act.”\\n\\n “Yes, leave them to us.” Xiao Yan mused for a moment before smiling and nodding his head.\\n\\n “The outer defenses of the city will be scattered by me when you act. I, myself, will also say that I am undertaking a retreat beforehand. This is all that I can do. You must be the ones to attack. After all, if this is leaked out, it would hurt the credibility of the Poison Sect.” Little Fairy Doctor slowly said.\\n\\n “Thank you very much.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor slightly nodded. She immediately changed the conversation to the main topic as she said, “Now, you can tell me how you will help me control the ‘Woeful Poison Body’. This should be the most important matter.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan vaguely nodded. He flicked his finger and a dark solemn-looking scroll appeared in his palm. After which, he tossed it to the Little Fairy Doctor. “The method to resolve it is in here. You can take a look. However, the medicinal ingredients that are mentioned inside are extremely difficult to find.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor extended her delicate hand and the scroll automatically landed in it. An excitement flashed across her eyes as she carefully opened it in a slow manner.\\n\\n “The ‘Woeful Poison Body’, a kind of considerably strange and unique constitution. Its nature is that of lethal poison. Those who make contact with the person who has the body will die. The body requires the consumption of poison to remain alive. However, the more poison that person consumes, the greater the density of poison that is accumulated in one’s body. Once the poison gathers until a certain stage, it will completely erupt. When it does so, all living things will be destroyed within a thousand kilometer radius. This poison body is extremely rare. It is differentiated between innate and acquired. Innate means that it comes with birth while acquired are those that are man-made. Among the two, the innate one is naturally a greater strength. Moreover, there is no method to undo it. However, if one possesses the luck, one will be able to completely control the poison. The poisonous strength within one’s body can be used as one pleases.”\\n\\n “This control method is called the Poison Pill Method. It gathers all the poison that is accumulated within one’s body and transforms all of it into a Poison Pill. Once the Poison Pill is formed, the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ would finally become a truly frightening constitution. The continent had once witnessed a couple of disasters that were caused by the ‘Woeful Poison Body’. However, those people who possessed the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ had never reached this stage. There is no reason for this other than that the ingredients that this Poison Pill Method require are too hard to find.”\\n\\n “The refinement of the Poison Pill can be mainly divided into three essential things that it requires. The first is three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’. The second is the Monster Core of a rank 7 ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’. The third is ‘Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva’.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor’s eyes slowly swept over the scroll. The excitement in her eyes gradually became dim. The ingredients that the Poison Pill required, that were recorded in this scroll, were really too frightening. No wonder there had not been a single person who successfully learned how to completely control the ‘Woeful Poison Body’.\\n\\n Three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’. Just this first condition was enough to discourage everyone. Everyone was aware of the destructive strength of a ‘Heavenly Flame’ on the continent. If an ordinary expert were able to obtain a single kind of ‘Heavenly Flame’, their fighting strength would definitely soar. If an alchemist were to obtain one, their success rate when refining medicinal pills would definitely soar. Hence, ‘Heavenly Flames’ possessed an extremely high status in the hearts of those experts on the Dou Qi continent.\\n\\n However, the ‘Heavenly Flames’ rarity was also common knowledge. Being able to obtain one was already a great blessing. As for three kinds…\\n\\n The second ingredient similarly caused a person to feel even more hopeless. The ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’ was a unique beast from ancient times. Its strength was extremely great. A rank 7 ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’ already possessed the qualification to transform into a human form. Its fighting strength was extremely terrifying. There was seldom anyone who could match them in the same rank. It was even more difficult to obtain its Monster Core.\\n\\n Of course, the first two conditions seemed to be a little easier when compared to the third one. At the very least, Little Fairy Doctor had heard of both the ‘Heavenly Flames’ and the ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’. The third ‘Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva’ was something that she had never even heard or seen before.\\n\\n With these three harsh conditions, Little Fairy Doctor understood why not a single person who possessed the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ had refined this so-called Poison Pill within their bodies as this control method had described.\\n\\n Xiao Yan sighed as he watched Little Fairy Doctor’s face which had instantly darkened. He immediately softly said, “You need not worry about the three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’. I am able to help you on this. However, you need to spend some effort on that Monster Core of the ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’ and the ‘Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva’.”\\n\\n “You possess three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’?” Little Fairy Doctor was startled when she heard this. Her eyes were stunned as they swept over Xiao Yan’s body. How could a person possess three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan smiled when he saw Little Fairy Doctor’s expression. He flicked his finger and a wisp of jade-green flame suddenly appeared. After which, it swiftly divided into a green flame and an invisible flame. Soon after, another dense white flame came out from the fire seal between Xiao Yan’s eyebrows.\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctors dim eyes finally revealed a joy as she looked at the three tiny flames that were suspended in front of Xiao Yan. She said, “No wonder you are able to fight with an elite Dou Zong with just the strength of a Dou Huang. It is actually because of this…”\\n\\n “But even if you have three kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’, that Monster Core of a ‘Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’ and the required ‘Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva’ are also extremely difficult to obtain…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan grinned as he looked at Little Fairy Doctor’s bitter smile. He said, “It is better than having no hope, right? I will do my best to help you get these things.”\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor slightly nodded upon hearing his words. This was indeed better than having no hope…\\n\\n “Alright, I will go and search for some information regarding this once I return. I will inform you if there is any news…” Little Fairy Doctor handed the scroll back to Xiao Yan. Before she was about to leave, she softly said, “In that case, I shall return first. You can break this jade piece when you want to act. I will do my best to cooperate.” She handed a gray jade piece to Xiao Yan.\\n\\n Xiao Yan nodded. He received the jade piece and stored it into his Storage Ring.\\n\\n Little Fairy Doctor did not stay longer after she saw that everything had been accounted for. Her body moved and she flashed into the air. Her footsteps paused just as she was about to leave. She turned her head to the black-robed, young man below and softly asked, “Will you still treat me as a friend now that I have become like this?”\\n\\n Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately revealed a bright smile, “My words from back then still stand.”\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-773","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
