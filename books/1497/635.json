A large group of little black dots swiftly appeared before finally turning into numerous human figures rushing past. The pressuring wind that was created from the fast speed caused numerous scar-like gullys to appear within the sea of trees in the mountains below. Moreover, the auras that were emitted from such a large number of experts caused all the Magical Beasts within this mountain range to softly whimper in fear. Even some of those powerful high ranked Magical Beasts did not dare be too active at this moment. Being in possession of a faint intelligence, they clearly knew that such a large aura was enough to destroy the entire mountain range. “We are about to reach the headquarters of the ‘Black Alliance’, Feng City. Everyone, be careful!” An elderly voice suddenly sounded beside everyone’s ears as they flew through the sky. “Be careful. Feng City is currently the city where the ‘Black Alliance’ has the tightest defenses. We have exchanged blows with them quite a number of times during these two years.” Xiao Yan’s gaze was looking toward the edge of the mountain range when a human figure immediately flashed beside him. Su Qian’s figure surfaced before reminding the former. “Aye. There are indeed quite a number of strong people within the city. I can sense that these auras appear to be quite familiar. Looks like, most of them are those who participated in the sneak attack back then.” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. By relying on his outstanding Spiritual Perception, he could sense the number of experts within the city more clearly than even Su Qian. Su Qian was not too surprised at this ability of Xiao Yan. He nodded his head and spoke with a somewhat dark and solemn expression, “Initially these scattered factions were indeed no match for the Jia Nan Academy. However, after the establishment of the ‘Black Alliance’ during these two years, we did not gain even a little advantage.” “The ‘Black Alliance’ is so strong?” Xiao Yan knit his brows slightly as he inquired in a soft voice. “Ugh, there are many Elders in the Jia Nan Academy, but most of them are of the Dou Wang strength. On the other hand, some of the faction leaders in the ‘Black Alliance’ are elite Dou Huangs. It is fortunate that we had the numerical advantage. Only due to this did we barely stabilize the situation.” Su Qian smiled bitterly and continued, “I may have the strength of a Dou Zong, but those two gold-silver old men who won’t die are able to delay me by joining hands. If we were to average out the other fighting strength, both parties could maintain an equilibrium. However, in each conflict, Han Feng would rely on the strength of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ to swiftly defeat those Inner Academy experts and join hands with the gold-silver brothers to attack me. You should also know that that fellow may be only a peak Dou Huang but the ‘Sea Heart Flame’ is something that I have to carefully deal with. Even I am helpless if they fight three against one.” “Although the strength of the Inner Academy has expanded quite a bit, it is much smaller than the expansion of the experts in the ‘Black Alliance’. You are also an alchemist. I think that you should know the gathering ability of a tier six alchemist. Which of those experts from the ‘Black-Corner Region’ don’t want a medicinal pill from the hands of Medicine Emperor Han Feng?” Xiao Yan nodded slightly. It is unexpected that Han Feng still had this tactic. In two short years, he was able to rely on his gathering ability to create a faction that could contend with an old academy like the Jia Nan Academy. Although the Jia Nan Academy definitely had quite a number of truly strong people hidden within it, these people were stubborn old fellows who would not appear unless it was a critical moment. They did not appear even when the Jia Nan Academy suffered such an intense attack back then. There was no need to even mention this kind of conflict to them. A conflict they did not consider to be very big. “Leave Han Feng to me. First Elder, it should not be a problem to handle the Gold Silver Brothers, right?” Xiao Yan smiled as he asked. “Although these two old fellows can rely on their excellent twin collaboration to temporarily fight with me, they will fall into a disadvantageous situation once things drag on. The gap between a Dou Zong and a Dou Huang is not something that can be easily made up for.” Su Qian finally sighed in relief as he confidently spoke when he heard Xiao Yan’s promise. “That’s good.” Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His gaze flickered. A moment later, he suddenly spoke softly, “First Elder, can you hand Han Feng to me if we manage to be victorious in this battle and capture him?” Su Qian was startled when he heard this, His gaze appeared to have a deeper meaning as he looked at Xiao Yan. He said, “Are you after the ‘Sea Heart Flame’ in his body?” Xiao Yan gave a noncommittal smile. “The ‘Sea Heart Flame’ is indeed an extremely valuable ‘Heavenly Flame’. However, according to what I know, it seems that alchemists can at the very most control one kind of ‘Heavenly Flame’? You unexpectedly now control two kinds… and can even continue to control a third kind?” Su Qian smiled. He tone was filled with an inexplicable feeling. Xiao Yan’s hand was clenched without anyone noticing under his sleeves. He smiled faintly, “One must give up something in order to obtain strength. First Elder merely knows that I possess two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’, but doesn’t know just what kind of torture and pain I endured in the magma underground. If not for luck, it is likely that I wouldn’t have had the chance to escape from underground, nor have the qualification to think about what is too dangerous.” “Perhaps attempting to control the ‘Heart Sea Flame’ may cause me to undergo a suffering of life and death. However, there is always a chance in everything. What I pursue is perhaps the lowest chance of success. This is because I know that once I succeed, I will be able to obtain sufficient strength only then. If I were to fail, being bitten by the ‘Heavenly Flame’ is only too common.” “You are trying to gamble your life again.” Su Qian was startled for a moment before sighing. He said, “With your talent, you will definitely have significant achievements if you train normally.” “My target is not so-called ‘significant achievements’.” Xiao Yan laughed softly. The ambition that was contained in that smile was something that silenced even an old fox like Su Qian. Only at this moment did he gain a little understanding that he seemed to have been underestimating this little fellow who had been repeatedly displaying miracles. “Alright. If we are to emerge victorious this time around and manage to capture Han Feng, I will hand him over to you.” Su Qian was quiet for a moment before he finally nodded. His hand patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders, and used a voice that no one could hear to softly speak to him, “Additionally, if you have the chance, you can greet Yao zun-zhe for me. Back then, he sort of had a friendship with the headmaster.” TL: zun-zhe - respectful manner to address a Dou Zun The jade-green fire wings which were flapping on Xiao Yan’s back paused. His eyes also shrank a little at this moment as he turned his head to look at the smiling face of Su Qian. “You… how did you sense it?” “Little fellow, don’t underestimate the eyesight of an elite Dou Zong. Moreover, I have met Yao zun-zhe in the past. However, I had yet to reach this position at that time.” Su Qian smiled as he waved his hand toward Xiao Yan. He said, “Relax, I will not leak this matter. However, from the looks of your grudge with Han Feng, I may perhaps guess that the matter of Yao zun-zhe’s death back then should have some relation to this fellow.” Xiao Yan’s tensed body slowly relaxed. He quietly nodded and his heart suddenly completely relaxed. The current him was already no longer that small Dou Ling from two years ago. Given his current strength, even Su Qian, who was in front of him, might not be able to kill him if he used all his strength. Hence, he had the confidence that he was able to protect teacher even if news of Yao Lao was leaked. This thought flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart. A faint smile suddenly surfaced on the corner of his mouth as he thought of everything that had happened in the past. Throughout the years, the young man who required Yao Lao’s protection back then had unknowingly transformed into a truly strong person. The current Xiao Yan was finally able to leave the protection of Yao Lao’s wings and soar through the sky. “Ke ke, in that case, thank you First Elder for keeping the secret.” Xiao Yan smiled and cupped his hands toward Su Qian. He immediately turned his head and gazed at the distant edge of his sight. The lush green mountains that were ever present had gradually disappeared. The somewhat familiar aura in the distance were even clearer. “We have arrived…” Su Qian raised his eyes. A cold glint flickered in his eyes as his cold voice suddenly resounded beside everyone’s ears. “Everyone, today will determine whether we can wash the humiliation from the sneak attack these bastards launched on that Inner Academy back then!” “Yes sir!” Numerous cries rang out from the sky in unison. Immediately, powerful auras rose abruptly. Under the increase of the powerful auras of such a large formation, even the clouds in the sky were shaken until they turned into countless numbers of fragmented white spots that spread throughout the sky. “Xiu! Xiu!” Numerous black figures flew across the distant sky like meteorites as the large aura surged. After which, they rushed toward the city that possessed quite a great reputation even in the ‘Black-Corner Region’. This large aura which the many strong people from the Inner Academy unleashed was not hidden in any way. Therefore, the pressure of that aura had covered the entirety of Feng City even before they had arrived. In an instant, the originally noisy city had basically descended into a silence in an instant. Numerous shocked gazes turned toward the direction where the aura originate. “Where are you from thieves? You dare attack our Feng City?” A large group of human figures suddenly rushed out from the private mansion in the middle of the city not long after the aura covered Feng City Finally, they scattered and remained suspended in mid-air. The person in front was wearing an alchemist robe. His cold laughter was just like rolling thunder that began to spread with a ‘bang’ after being mixed with his Dou Qi. The city immediately started to boil as they saw the numerous human figures appearing in the sky. As the owner of Feng City, Han Feng’s reputation was unmatched by anyone in this place. Of course, the people in the ‘Black-Corner Region’ only believed in the strong. Han Feng naturally possessed his own strength to own such a reputation in this place. If someone stronger appeared, this reputation of his would likely take a sudden decline. “Han Feng, back then, you attacked our Inner Academy. Today, we shall completely settle all our grudges!” Han Feng’s voice had just sounded when an old majestic voice rolled over from afar. Immediately, numerous figures appeared in front of the countless number of gazes. “Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!” Human figures flashed and arrived in the sky before finally standing in the empty air outside of Feng City. An enormous pressure spread out and engulfed the entire place. Han Feng narrowed his gaze and swept it slowly over the many experts from the Inner Academy. A moment later, it finally came to an abrupt pause. The spot where his eyes paused in surprise was the owner of that hot aura which even the ‘Sea Heart Flame’ was afraid of! “How unexpected… it is actually you… Xiao Yan!” Han Feng’s face twitched slightly as his dark and solemn voice slowly resounded through the sky. The entire city once again boiled under this name that was basically known to everyone within the ‘Black-Corner City’!
