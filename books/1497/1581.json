Immediately, a bright light that caused one to be stunned flashed across the sky. In a flash, it appeared in the horizon. The rumbling explosion caused many experts along the way to raise their heads in shock.\n Soon after the bright light flashed across the sky, a monstrous evil aura suddenly spread across the sky from behind. A black light flew passed. The monstrous evil aura caused many experts to be frightened. Even some of the sects did not dare to pay attention to it. Just a random wave of a hand by that kind of expert would likely eliminate the entire faction. The chasing conducted by such an expert was not something that they could observe.\n “This fellow really doesn’t give up.”\n The bright light flashed through the sky. The figure inside paused momentarily and frowned upon sensing the murderous aura from behind.\n That figure was naturally Xiao Yan who had fled after exchanging blows with Hun Sha. However, he did not expect that the latter would actually continue to follow him. From the looks of it, the latter did not show any signs of giving up.\n “Mister Xiao Yan, there is still half a day’s journey from this place to the Gu Realm. That fellow is catching up…” Ydo Tian, who was in Xiao Yan’s hand, did his best to block the wind pressure from their great speed and cried out loud.\n Xiao Yan nodded slightly and frowned. The energy of the tier 9 Mysterious Pill could only be described as terrifying. Currently, the interior of his body had already been damaged by the wild and violent energy until it was extremely miserable. Even though Little Yi had already done its best to refine the energy, it was still a little insignificant. If it was not because of his strong body, his body might have already exploded from the energy. Despite this, it was clearly not a long term solution. How would he escaped from Hun Sha if the energy from the tier 9 Mysterious Pill was to injure his body?\n “The both of you should prepare to leave first. The condition inside my body is quite bad. If I’m afraid the Hun Sha will catch up soon if I bring the two of you along with me. One of you should be able to keep your life if you leave now. That fellow’s target is me. It is likely that he won’t chase you.” Xiao Yan mused for a moment and spoke in a deep voice. Even with the support of the energy from the tier 9 Mysterious Pill, his speed would be slower than Hun Sha if he brought two people with him.\n “I’ll follow you!” Yao Tian and Yao Ling spoke almost at the same time after Xiao Yan’s words sounded. They were aware that it was most dangerous to follow beside Xiao Yan. However, they wished to leave the safest position to the other party.\n “What a touching scene. However, there is no time for argument now.” Xiao Yan frowned and said.\n Yao Tian and Yao Ling were stunned as he heard this. The latter immediately threw a palm onto Yao Tian’s chest. A gentle force pushed The latter away from Xiao Yan. However, Xiao Yan did not stop her. With a wave of his sleeve, he sent Yao Tian flying through the sky. A voice was transmitted into the latter’s ears, “Hurry up and leave.”\n Yao Tian steadied his body in a miserable manner. His eyes were completely red as he looked at Xiao Yan duo flying into the distance. Without uttering any unnecessary words? He turned around and hurried in another direction.\n “You are really decisive…” Xiao Yan hugged Yso Ling’s delicate waist. Pink flame wrapped around the both of them. Their speed suddenly soared.\n Yao Ling’s face was a little flushed as her delicate waist was being tightly hugged by Xiao Yan. That cold frost on her face had also diminished slightly. She turned her head and looked at the face beside her. This was a face that was far from the handsome look of her brother Yso Tian. However, it caused her eyes to flicker. Given her cold and haughty nature, she had seldom felt any admiration for a person of the opposite gender during these years. This person was the only exception…\n The time which both parties had been in contact was quite short. Xiao Yan was serious and casual while he was\n A beauty loves a hero. Regardless of how cold the beauty was, it was impossible for her to be an exception to this rule.\n Xiao Yan did not have the time to be bothered with the thoughts of the beauty in his embrace. At this moment, most of his thoughts were focused on suppressing and refining the out of controlled vast and mighty energy in his body. At the same time, he must maintain his speed. These various matters was quite a big test to him.\n “Separate huh…”\n From far behind Xiao Yan, Hun Sha, who had a gloomy expression, quickly swept his eyes over Xiao Yan’s and Yao Tian’s back. Finally, he let out a cold snort and continued chasing after Xiao Yan. These members of the Yao clan who had escaped, were completely useless to them. However, it was different when it came to Xiao Yan. The latter had the Tou She Ancient God Jade in his hand. This was something the Hun clan must obtain.\n “I wish to see just how long you can last for!”\n ...\n One party fled while the other chased in the sky. This continued for a couple of hours. During this period of time, the two parties had basically crossed half of the Central Plains. Although they had caught the attention of many experts along the way, no one dared to intervene in the face of Hun Sha’s shocking aura. All they did was simply watch the both parties flying through the sky.\n Following the flow of time, Xiao Yan’s condition had clearly become increasingly worse. The crystal like seemingly endless energy gathered within the meridians of his body. It firmly sealed off the many meridians. Even though Little Yi was doing its best to refine the energy, there would be an endless amount of energy crystals continuously appearing. The energy crystals slowly swelled and a vague pain was felt in Xiao Yan’s unusually tough meridians. The energy of a tier 9 Mysterious Pill was actually this frightening.\n “Mister Xiao Yan.”\n Yao Ling looked at Xiao Yan’s miserable expression. Although the strength of her Dou Qi was not very strong, her Spiritual Strength was quite powerful. Hence, she had also sensed that Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength had become exhausted as it continued to weaken.\n “If something becomes amiss later on, I will send you away.” Xiao Yan forcefully braced his attention. Currently, his body was not only filled with external injuries but the inside of his body was also a complete mess. It was already quite difficult for him to last until now.\n Yao Ling gently bit her lips. She suddenly extended her snow white wrist and handed it to Xiao Yan. She softly said, “My constitution is a little unique. Hence, my blood possess the effect of nourishing Spiritual Strength. Mister Xiao Yan…”\n Xiao Yan was immediately startled upon hearing this. His eyes glanced at the exquisite and attractive face of Yao Ling. The latter looked at him seriously. That appearance did not seem like she was lying.\n “There is actually such a strange constitution… no wonder it is said that this lady might have a chance to step into the Di state Spiritual Strength. It is likely because of this constitution.” A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s mind. He did not utter anything unnecessary as he bit on Yao Ling’s wrist. His teeth pierced into the blood vessel. A great amount of bright red blood was sucked into Xiao Yan’s mouth.\n Xiao Yan violently shuddered after the blood, which contained a little unusual sweetness entered his mouth. The blood had turned into a mysterious energy immediately upon entering his mouth. It spread swiftly and surged towards the centre of his brow. His originally exhausted Spiritual Strength was actually being wrapped by a faint blood light. A feeling that was fuller than when he was at his peak suddenly appeared.\n “What mysterious blood…”\n Asleek redness swiftly rose ontk Xiao Yan’s face. Both of his eyes brightened. He could clearly sense that his soul was greedily devouring the blood. This was the first time he had ever felt such a sensation.\n “My Spiritual Strength might advance further if I sucj her blood dry…”\n A thought from an unknown source flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart. It was quickly eliminated by Xiao Yan in the next instant. He looked at Yao Ling, who was gently biting her red lips while wearing a pale expression, and involuntarily slapped himself violently within his heart for the beast like thought. He slowly relaxed his mouth and wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth. After which he muttered in an apologetic manner, “Thank you very much.”\n Yao Ling shook her head slightly. Her pretty eyes looked behind her as she pressed her eyebrows together and said, “That fellow has become faster…”\n Xiao Yan’s expression changed slightly upon hearing this. He discovered that the sound of rushing wind far behind had become increasingly deep. Clearly, Hun Sha had begun to feel impatient and had used some unknown method to increase his speed.\n “Hold tight. This place is already quite close to the Gu clan. We will be safe once we arrive…” Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. His eyes had become stern. The green-red wings on his back were flapped and his body turned into a lightning that swiftly hurried into the horizon.\n “Brat; I will not give you the opportunity to seek refuge in the Gu clan!”\n Hun Sha’s face appeared extremely gloomy as he gave chase from behind. He did not expect Xiao Yan’s speed to suddenly increase after having slowed for a moment. Immediately, the seal formed by his hands changed. Black Dou Qi erupted in a monstrous fashion and turned into a black bat that was thousands of feet in size. A mouthful of essence blood was spat out. It adhered onto the bat. The bat flapped its wings. One could hear a swoosh sound as it completely vanished.\n “This is bad!”\n Xiao Yan’s expression changed drastically the moment Hun Sha’s figure disappeared. He grabbed Yao Ling in his embrance and suddenly lowered his body.\n “Chi!”\n Xiao Yan’s body had just descended when a blood glow rushed out from the space above his head. It brushed past his head as it flew passed.\n “Xiao Yan, where will you flee to?” The space fluctuated and a dense looking Hun Sha broke out from it. His eyes were ferocious as he stared at Xiao Yan. The blood blade in his hand was swung and a huge blood glow, which was tens of thousands of feet in size, cut through the air. It had the might of shattering the land as it slashed onto Xiao Yan duo.\n The blood glow was rapidly magnified in Xiao Yan’s eyes. His face was extremely gloomy. His shoulder shook and Little Yi appeared in a flash. A golden lightning dragon was quickly wiggling on Little Yi’s arm.\n However, Xiao Yan was just about to use the strength of the Nine Mysterious Golden Lightning as a final retaliation when an elderly figure suddenly appeared in the space in front of him. A cry resounded from that figure.\n “Trying to murder in the territory of my Gu clan. Hun Sha, you are really a little too arrogant…”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1581","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
