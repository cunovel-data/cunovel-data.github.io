Everyone’s expressions drastically changed. Numerous pairs of eyes landed on that churning black light pillar in the sky while feeling their mind go numb. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had allowed itself to be captured?\\n\\n “How can it be possible…”\\n\\n Huo Yao and the few experts who had cooperated earlier muttered with stunned faces. If this was the case, this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was indeed a little too frightening. A Heavenly Flame that schemed against people. Even people like them had were only witnessing such a thing for the first time…\\n\\n “This…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s face was filled with surprise as he exchanged glances with Xun Er. After which, he slowly nodded. Given the frightening strength of the ancestor of the Small Pill Tower, it would be quite difficult for him to make a mistake.\\n\\n “Hmph, what nonsense. Regardless of how strong the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is, it would definitely have difficulty escaping my Hun clan’s Tianluo Sealing Demon Formation!” The chief of the Hall of Souls revealed a somewhat ugly expression as he spoke in a deep voice.\\n\\n The eyes of Old Man Mo Hun by the side flickered. He stared at the black light pillar in the sky, but he did not voice any doubt. He had came into contact with the ancestor of the Pill Tower a couple of times. Naturally, he understood that the ancestor of the Pill Tower was not someone who uttered nonsense. Since the youth had put it this way, he ought to be confident in his words.\\n\\n The ancestor of the Pill Tower did not give an explanation despite everyone’s doubtful eyes. He merely observed the churning black light pillar. He finally spoke in a faint voice a moment later after seeing that it had not reacted, “Since you are unwilling to reveal yourself, I can only force you to do so…”\\n\\n The ancestor of the Pill Towee flicked his finger after his words sounded. A black line suddenly erupted from the tip of his finger. The black line might appear weak, but space itself quietly formed a vacuum wherever it passed. It rushed toward the black light pillar with lightning-like speed.\\n\\n The speed of the black line was so quick that it left one speechless. In an instant, it was only half-a-foot from the light pillar, but the sealed demonic flame essence violently trembled before the black line struck it. An earth-shaking fire wave surged in all directions as the black light pillar exploded apart in front of everyone’s stunned eyes.\\n\\n “Old demon, you have ruined my plans again. Are you trying to seek death!”\\n\\n Cream-white flames swept across the sky as a figure formed in this sea of flames. It was that white-robed Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. The Heavenly Flame was glaring at the ancestor of the Pill Tower with a dark and cold expression as he furiously cried out.\\n\\n “This fellow has really purposefully allowed himself to be sealed.”\\n\\n The hearts of Xiao Yan and the others violently pounded upon seeing the figure form. The expression of the chief of the Hall of Souls became uglier. It was clearly extremely easy for the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to break the seal earlier. From this, one could tell that the words of the ancestor of the Pill Tower had indeed been true. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had allowed itself to be sealed in order to reap the gains from their conflicts. This cunning was really on a different level.\\n\\n “Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, your character is extremely brutal. If you are allowed to enter the Central Plains, you will definitely leave a destruction in your wake. It was due to this that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint chose to seal you when he was reaching the end of his life back then. Therefore, you cannot leave this place…” The ancestor of the Pill Tower lifted his somewhat tender face, looked at the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame standing in the air, and slowly explained.\\n\\n “That old bastard. I accompanied him for a thousand years. I at least put in the effort for him, yet he did not care about our ties and actually sealed me. Finally, he ended up suffering from my backlash. That was his retribution. Moreover, whether I can leave is not up to you to decide. Even though you have currently advanced to a six star Dou Sheng, it is still not enough to stop me!” The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s eyes turned cold as he stated.\\n\\n The ancestor of the Pill Tower softly sighed. His eyes glanced at Old Man Hun Mo a short distance away. Seeing him look over, Old Man Hun Mo strangely laughed and said, “Old demon, you should fight alone if you wish to deal with it. Our Hun clan does feel obligated to protect the whatever Central Plains. It will be easier for our Hun clan to capture it should it leave the demonic flame realm and head to the Central Plains.”\\n\\n This Old Man Hun Mo was unusually cunning. Although he spoke without a care, he was clearly planning on idly watching tigers fight. He would wait for the ancestor of the Pill Tower and the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to fight. Then, he would benefit from the outcome when the time came.\\n\\n The ancestor of the Pill Tower was unsurprised when he heard Old Man Hun Mo’s words. Hence, he withdrew his eyes.\\n\\n “Elder, do you need us to fight?” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and asked. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was unusually terrifying. Although the ancestor of the Pill Tower was unfathomable, it would definitely be an extremely intense battle if they were to fight.\\n\\n “It is unnecessary. Currently, none of you will be able to help…” The ancestor of the Pill Tower smiled and shook his head upon hearing this question. His toes pressed against the bull. His short body penetrated the sea of fire and appeared in front of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He said, “The seal that the Purifying Lotus Demon Saint had placed is not easily broken. Even though you have borrowed the world tide to tear through to the world, the seal will naturally reform, following the withdrawal of the world tide. As long as I delay you until that time comes, you will not be able to leave this place…”\\n\\n “In that case, we’ll have to see if you have the ability to stop me!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame coldly laughed. Both of his hands suddenly changed. The cream-white flames that permeated the sky around him swiftly returned to him before they agglomerated into a hundred-thousand-foot-tall fire giant amid many stunned eyes.\\n\\n “Demonic Flame Divine Statue!”\\n\\n The fire giant’s legs were inserted into the sea of magma below. Its incomparably large body caused one’s soul to tremble. With a punch from this giant, even an elite Dou Sheng would likely be shattered into nothing…\\n\\n “Old ghost, die!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame stood on the head of the divine figure. His eyes looked at the ant-like figures below as he gave a dense smile. That demon flame statue suddenly lifted its mountain-like fist before throwing it toward the Pill Tower ancestor. This punch had only just been thrown when the surface of the sea of magma a hundred thousand feet below revealed a huge magma spiral that was tens of thousands of feet in size. Air itself seemed to crazily whistle.\\n\\n The expressions of Xiao Yan’s group involuntarily became pale when they sensed this fist wind that was filled with a destructive force. Regardless of whether it was Zi Yan or Gu Nanhai, anyone who received this strike head-on would instantly turn into dust…\\n\\n The figure of the ancestor of the Pill Tower remained suspended in the sky. His eyes stared at the giant fist that seemed to fall like a meteorite. He widened his mouth and a bright golden light erupted from it. The light turned into an enormous light curtain that covered the sky.\\n\\n “Bang!”\\n\\n The giant fist of the statue violently smashed into the golden light curtain. A frightening wind assault immediately swept apart. One could hear a crack form in the space within a hundred thousand feet before everything exploded into a charred black mess. The area around them eas blasted apart as the two fought…\\n\\n “Pill Merging Sky!”\\n\\n The finger of the ancestor of the Pill Tower was lifted. A drop of green blood seeped out of his pores. One seemed to be able to glimpse the strand of golden luster in that dense-green color.\\n\\n This green-colored blood swiftly flew toward the demonic flame divine figure the moment it escaped the ancestor’s body. It became larger as it flew. Within a short instant, it had turned into a thousand-foot-large green light ray. The light ray was accompanied by a dense fragrance as it shot through the sky. Finally, it smashed into the chest of the divine statue made of demonic flames with lightning-like speed. Green light immediately filled one’s vision, but one could see over half of the divine statue made of demonic flames melting away…\\n\\n “The ability of this old demon is becoming more terrifying. He is even able to melt the demonic flame…” A grave expression flashed across Old Man Hun Mo’s eyes in the distance after seeing the flame melt.\\n\\n “Roar!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame became furious after the demonic flame statue was seriously damaged. Everything in the world possessed something that complimented it and something that was its nemesis. The actual form of the ancestor of the Pill Tower was a medicinal pill. Common sense dictated that he should be extremely afraid of such a flame, but as the strength of the ancestor from the Pill Tower increased, a mutation had begun to form in his body. This mutation suppressed things related to fire. This suppression had caused the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to feel a great pressure.\\n\\n “Old demon, whoever dares hinder my escape today will be refined alive by me. Your actual form is a pill. I wish to see what you will turn into if I refine you again!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame roared at the sky. His body suddenly charged to the horizon. Many cream-colored lines of fire shot out in all directions. They shot across the entire demonic flame realm.\\n\\n “Refining Sky Ancient Array, appear!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame loudly cried out after these fire lines shot deep into the realm before a loud rumbling sound was emitted. After which, everyone was shocked to see a hundred-thousand-foot-large fire array slowly appear in the empty sky…\\n\\n “Rumble!”\\n\\n The endless magma sea begun to churn soon after the large array appeared in the sky. Soon, even it slowly formed an extremely huge fire formation in front of everyone’s stunned eyes...\\n\\n Both the expression of the ancestor of the Pill Tower and the expression of Old Man Hun Mo became ugly when these two fire formation appeared, one above, one below.\\n\\n “Ha ha, old demon, you didn’t expect this, did you? The large sealing formation that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint had personally placed is being used by me. I have already comprehended all its mysteries during these few thousand years. Who will be able to fight me within this demonic flame realm now?” The ancient array that covered the realm slowly rotated while the Purifying Demonic Flame laughed to the sky.\\n\\n “It is going to be troublesome this time around…”\\n\\n Everyone observed these formations as they inhaled a breath of cold air. These terrifying formations were many times stronger than the Tianluo Sealing Demon Formation the chief of the Hall of Souls had used earlier.\\n\\n ZiYan and the others stared at the huge formations, one in the sky and one above the earth. A great wave seemed to be rising within their hearts. If either of these large arrays were to unleash even a little energy, they would easily kill everyone...\\n\\n While everyone was feeling shocked because of the sudden changes, Xiao Yan suddenly grabbed his forehead. That mysterious light cluster within his head suddenly trembled. That shaking appeared as though something was about to awaken…\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1516","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
