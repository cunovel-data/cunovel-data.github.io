He deeply searched Xiao Yan before faintly laughing, “You are indeed sufficiently heroic. Since this is the case, friends whose strengths have reached the fourth star of the Dou Sheng class should attack with me and finish off the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. The rest will have to handle the fire slaves.”\\n\\n “Leave the other fire slaves to us…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan slightly grinned. He turned his head and softly spoke to Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai. “Both of you should be careful when joining hands to deal with the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Try not to use your full strength to prevent someone from launching a sneak attack on you.”\\n\\n Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai nodded. They were not ordinary individuals. They were well aware of the current situation. If one was not careful when cooperating with those people from the Hall of Souls, one would be left with nothing.\\n\\n “Xiao Yan, I cannot join the attack against the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Once I approach it, this seal of yours will lose its effect. Moreover, I will also be controlled.” Xiao Chen spoke in a hoarse voice.\\n\\n “Ancestor Xiao Chen, there is no need for you to fight. We should always hold something back…” Xiao Yan smiled as he replied. He was worried about the people from the Hall of Souls. Although the chief of the Hall of Souls would join the battle, the deputy chief and the Hun Feng, who gave him a dangerous feeling, were still around. He needed to maintain caution around those two.\\n\\n Xiao Chen quietly nodded in the face of Xiao Yan’s words. He did not like to speak. Ever since he had been captured by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame back then, he had been immersed in the other party’s illusion. Moreover, it was difficult for him to escape. If Xiao Yan had not rescued him, he would have sooner or later lost his mind to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He would have eventually become an ordinary fire slave that was controlled by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.\\n\\n Having survived in the illusion for thousands of years caused Xiao Chen’s temperamental character to become a lot more quiet and lonely. This loneliness had grown even greater after he heard Xiao Yan mention the decline of the Xiao clan. After all, he was no longer someone of this era…\\n\\n He was unable to lend a hand when the clan needed him the most.\\n\\n “I’ll trouble ancestor…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan cupped his hands to Xiao Chen. There was no need to doubt Xiao Chen’s powerful strength. Even the combination of Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai were unable to gain much of an advantage against him. If one were to weigh his strength, he would likely be the strongest person present other than the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Moreover, due to his aura being strange, it was likely that even the chief of the Hall of Souls would not be able to detect that the strength of this man with a numb expression was overwhelming.\\n\\n This character that others were didn’t know about would protect Xiao Yan’s group.\\n\\n “You are currently the only clan member of the Xiao clan who currently possesses the bloodline strength. Rest assured that I will do my best to protect you…” Xiao Chen slowly shook his head before glancing at Xiao Yan’s young face. As he studied this member from younger generation who shared the same bloodline as him, his somewhat numb face finally revealed a gentle smile for the first time. “This talent of yours is many times stronger compared to mine. The Xiao clan will have a chance to be revitalized with you around. I have committed far too many reckless actions in the past and had brought much trouble on the clan members. Now that the heavens have given me this opportunity, I will contribute everything I have to the Xiao clan, even if it requires my life.”\\n\\n Xiao Yan was quiet. He once again respectfully cupped his hands to Xiao Chen. Only then did he turn his head and quickly sweep his gaze around. There were a total of eight experts present whose strength was at the fourth star of the Dou Sheng class and above. Since Xiao Chen wasn’t able to join the fight, there were only seven individuals joining hands to fight the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. This lineup was relatively frightening. They would have a high chance of success even while facing the terrifying strength of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame…\\n\\n The chief of the Hall of Souls took the lead to step through the air while Xiao Yan was calculating their chances of victory in his heart. His body paused, and he appeared within a thousand feet from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. The remaining experts also moved their bodies and formed a circular shape around the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.\\n\\n Seven four star Dou Shengs!\\n\\n Just this aura alone was worthy of shocking the world. The might from the seven working together could cause the world to change.\\n\\n The other people around exchanged grave expressions with each other upon seeing the lineup in the sky. They swiftly pulled back in unison. There was nothing they could do to help during this earth-shaking battle.\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame standing on a magma pillar smiled while everyone quickly pulled back. His handsome face slowly lifted into a strange smile. “What a scene that one yearns for…”\\n\\n “Fire Demon Halberd!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s hand gently clenched the air while he faced the endless sea of magma below. One could see a portion of the magma sea began to churn. A dense-white long flame halberd suddenly shot out of the magma and appeared in the hands of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame in a flash.\\n\\n “I have been sealed for thousands of years. Today, anyone who blocks me… shall die!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame suddenly lifted his head after the final word was suddenly emitted from his mouth. He widened his mouth, and a giant demonic flame wave that was a couple thousand feet large suddenly shot out. That terrifying temperature caused the expression of the chief of the Hall of Souls and the others to change.\\n\\n “Attack together!”\\n\\n The eyes of the chief of the Hall of Souls flickered. Black vapor surged out of his body in all directions. After which, the vapor appeared like churning clouds as they collided with that large fire wave, but the black fog scattered upon contact. The large fire wave separated and transformed into seven huge fire pillars that ruthlessly smashed toward the seven individuals.\\n\\n Zi Yan and the rest did not dare to slight the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame after sensing it unleash such a strength when attacking. Dou Qi hurriedly surged from their bodies. Many shockingly powerful Dou Skills were formed.\\n\\n “Bang bang bang!”\\n\\n The fire pillars exploded in the sky. They appeared like the most beautiful fireworks ever displayed, but beneath that beauty hid a destructive force.\\n\\n “Trump trump!”\\n\\n Sparks erupted in the sky as seven figures staggered back. Half of the clothes of Yao Wangui from the Yao clan and an Elder of the Shi clan were burned, causing them to appear quite miserable. Their appearances clearly indicated that the seven of them did not enjoy the slightest advantage against the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame despite working together.\\n\\n “Great Tragedy Hand!”\\n\\n An icy-cold smile surfaced on the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s handsome face after obtaining an advantage with an attack. His body floated in the sky as his right hand suddenly grabbed at the sea of magma below. One could see the sea of magma below suddenly exploding as a ten-thousand-foot-large magma hand broke away from the sea. It was accompanied by a shocking heat as it shot toward them.\\n\\n “Boom!”\\n\\n The speed of the magma hand was mind-boggling. The hand came and ruthlessly slammed into the seven individuals as though they were houseflies before they could even retaliate. It emitted some splashing sound as it returned to the magma below.\\n\\n “Ant-like creatures…”\\n\\n Xiao Yan’s group watched this exchange. The shock on their faces became denser. Seven experts who had reached the fourth star of the Dou Sheng class had ended up miserable due to the hands of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Although the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame possessed the advantage in terms of terrain, this overwhelming attack was really a little too ferocious.\\n\\n “Bang bang!”\\n\\n The surface of the sea of magma exploded apart. A couple of miserable figures once again charged forward. They floated in the air aa green and white mixed on their faces. They were all top-notch experts on the Central Plains. Since when had they been beaten into such a state?\\n\\n “Everyone, if we continue to hold our strength back, we will not get a chance to attack again…” The chief of the Hall of Souls coldly cried out with a gloomy expression. They would likely begin to lose some people if this continued.\\n\\n The six others frowned upon hearing his words. The two fierce strikes from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame earlier had caused their bodies to suffer some injuries, especially injuries from the demonic flame force. They were momentarily unable to expel it despite their strength...\\n\\n “We can only defeat the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame before deciding on what to do.”\\n\\n This thought flashed across everyone’s minds. Their expressions slowly became grave. The originally vast and mighty auras of the seven individuals floating beside the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame swiftly soared!\\n\\n “Roar!”\\n\\n Zi Yan’s delicate figure shook as a dragon’s roar reverberated across this realm. She transformed into a ten-thousand-foot-large Dragon Phoenix body. She flapped her huge phoenix wings and stirred waves of hot tornadoes. A terrifying pressure also descended.\\n\\n “This is… why does this Ancient Void Dragon have such a form?”\\n\\n The chief of the Hall of Souls looked at Zi Yan’s transformation. He was startled. His eyes slightly flickered. A moment later, he hurriedly tossed aside the doubt within his heart. His hand seals quickly changed. A vast and mighty Dou Qi that caused even the world to tremble spread from his body. It seemed that he had begun to unleash all of his strength at this moment.\\n\\n The remaining five individuals clenched their teeth and ceased holding back after Zi Yan and the chief of the Hall of Souls unleashed their full strengths. Wild wind blew over this area at this moment. Dark clouds gathered and thunderbolts raged. Even the magma sea region below had begun to wildly roar, stirring thousand-foot-large waves of magma.\\n\\n The seven four star Dou Sheng had finally displayed their greatest strengths!\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame lifted his brow after sensing the sudden surge in everyone’s auras. He coldly laughed, “It’s only interesting this way…”\\n\\n “Fire slaves, kill everyone else. Just these fire slaves are enough!”\\n\\n The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame lowered his eyes. He glanced at Xiao Yan’s group in the distant. A dense smile surfaced on his handsome face while his indifferent voice slowly gave a command.\\n\\n “Roar!”\\n\\n Those ten Dou Sheng fire slaves suspended in the air suddenly opened their eyes after the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame’s words sounded. Those hollow eyes emitted two clusters of cream-colored Purifying Demonic Lotus Flames. Their bodies moved as they charge toward Xiao Yan’s group without hesitation.\\n\\n The entire realm turned into an uproar in an instant!\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1508","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
