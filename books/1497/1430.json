{"id":48064,"no":1430,"title":"Chapter 1430: Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame","content":"Chapter 1430: Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame A golden Flame lingered above the ground. It appeared to have ignited the sky at this moment. The Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame was ranked fourth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. It was only inferior to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Although this Heavenly Flame was not as mysterious as the Purifying Demon Lotus Flame, it was renowned during the ancient times. Moreover, this kind of Heavenly Flame was an inheritance of the Gu clan, but seldom anyone could subdue it. Hence, Saint Gu You’s heart was a little shaken when he recognized this flame. “It is indeed the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame…” Xiao Yan sensed an intense fire fluctuation from the distant sky. His heart shook. He had already guessed this a long time ago, but Xun Er seldomly unleashed the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame. Hence, he had never confirmed his guess. “It is indeed worthy of the Gu clan to be in possession of a mysterious inheritance like this Heavenly Flame…” Xiao Yan sighed in envy within his heart. The Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame was ranked high on the Heavenly Flame ranking. This naturally proved its great strength. If one were to talk about its ferocity, even Xiao Yan’s newly born Heavenly Flame, made from the merger of four Heavenly Flames, might not be better than this Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame. After all, the Heavenly Flames that were ranked near the top of the Heavenly Flame ranking were unbelievably terrifying. An example was the top three Heavenly Flames. Saying that they possessed the strength to destroy the world was not an exaggeration. A great disaster had befallen the world in ancient times any time a top Heavenly Flame erupted. Xiao Yan swiftly focused his mind as this thought lingered within his heart. Four clusters of Heavenly Flames swiftly merged together[a][b][c] as waves of violent destructive fluctuations quietly spread. “It is rumored that the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame can burn Dou Qi. Its ferocity is well-known. Today, this elderly-self shall take a look to see if it is as the rumors describe…” Gu You stepped through the air. His green eyes stared at Xun Er, who was some distance away, as he spoke in a hoarse voice. Black fog suddenly surged from the skeleton walking stick in his hand after his final word sounded. In the blink of an eye, this black fog permeated the sky. An extremely dark and cold energy hid in this black fog. Hence, it did not scatter despite the high temperature in the sky. Instead, the fog quickly agglomerated into an enormous black skeleton under Gu You’s control. This black skeleton was ten thousand feet tall. It stood in the sky like a divine skeleton of evil. A dense black fog churned out of its body as a chilly pressure swept out. It caused most of the people present to feel as though their very soul was in a chilly pond. The atmosphere was exceptionally gloomy and cold. “Darkness Skeleton King… he has summoned this thing the moment he started fighting. It seems that Elder Gu You is quite afraid of the so-called Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame…” Hun Yu pondered some thoughts as he observed the enormous black skeleton in the sky. This black skeleton was a rare Tian class low grade Dou Skill. One would be able to use one’s Dou Qi and the surrounding energy to form a skeleton king after mastering it. This skeleton king was as hard as metal and was immune to fire and water. Moreover, each and every part of its body contained an extremely dark and cold energy. If an ordinary expert were to be struck by this darkness, that expert’s body might look fine, but their soul would be eroded. Hence, this thing could be considered quite sinister and vicious. With Gu You’s current Ban Sheng strength, the black skeleton that he had summoned after unleashing this Dou Skill with all his strength was frighteningly powerful. Even some experts who had reached the Ban Sheng class had to be cautious when facing this big thing. Thus, one could tell how troublesome the black skeleton king was. “Go!” Gu You pointed the skeleton walking stick at Xun Er from afar after summoning the enormous black skeleton. Two clusters of green light immediately appeared. He took a step across the sky and appeared a short distance in front of Xun Er. The skeleton’s palm, which was covered with a dark-black fog, easily tore through space and ruthlessly slammed toward Xun Er’s head. Xun Er did not dare to slight the skeleton’s ferocious and shockingly powerful attack. Her lovely figure swiftly pulled back. At the same time, a hundred-foot-large golden flame cluster suddenly surged out of her body. It ruthlessly collided with the black skeleton’s hand. “Sizzle sizzle!” A sharp sizzling sound erupted when the two collided. An extreme cold and an extreme heat intertwined with each other. A nauseating white fog rose and spread. “Bang!” Gu You’s shriveled hand was clenched as he stood far away. That enormous skeleton’s hand was also clenched. One could hear a crack sound as the golden flame was shattered. Xun Er bunched her eyebrows together after her retaliation attack was easily destroyed. An elite Ban Sheng was indeed very powerful. Even though she possessed the aid of the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame, she was only able to protect herself. Fortunately, Xun Er’s task was not to defeat Gu You. Instead, her aim was to delay him. “Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Formation!” Xun Er’s delicate body swiftly pulled back. Her hand formed many mysterious seals. After her cool cry sounded, the golden flame that lingered in the sky suddenly began to wiggle. A dozen plus golden fire pillars shot down from the sky. The fire pillars spread and merged with each other. It appeared like fishing net made of fire that connected the sky and the land, trapping the enormous black skeleton in the process. “Bang!” The black skeleton’s fist, which contained a dark and chilly fog, ruthlessly slammed into the fire curtain. An earth-shaking sound appeared as many ripples formed on the fire curtain. “Refine!” Xun Er’s face was grave. The seal formed by her hand changed as countless golden fire pillars shot out of the formation. They struck the surrounding fire curtain before being reflected. Finally, all of them shot into the enormous skeleton close together. These fire pillars had become even more glaring after being reflected by the fire curtain. The frightening temperature within them caused the air inside of the great formation to ignite. A glaring golden flame fiercely and wildly burned the enormous black skeleton. “What a frightening flame…” The expressions of most people present changed as they looked at the golden flame that seemed to have spread across every corner of the great formation. Even with the isolation of the large formation, they were still able to sense just how terrifying the temperature was within it. Even an expert at the ninth change peak of the Dou Zun class would not be able to endure for more than a minute inside. After all, the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame was a frightening Heavenly Flame said to be able to burn even Dou Qi. Roar! The black fog around the enormous black skeleton quickly disappeared because of these wildly incinerating golden flames. Some of the bones had even become blurry at this moment. Regardless of how strong Gu You was, it was impossible for him to completely ignore the frightening Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame. “It is indeed worthy of being the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame.” Gu You knit his brows when he saw the black skeleton struggling within the fire formation. If Xun Er did not possess the Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame, she would not have been able to force the Darkness Skeleton into such a state regardless of the Dou Qi she used. Unfortunately… “Although the Heavenly Flame is powerful, you are unable to unleash its full potential with your strength. It was rumored that the first owner of this legendary Gold Emperor Incinerating Heavenly Flame could burn the realm created by an elite Dou Sheng into nothing with this flame…” Gu You’s eyes flickered as his shriveled hands formed a strange seal. At the same time, a strange sound was emitted from his mouth. “Roar!” The large black skeleton in the sea of golden flames suddenly shook after Gu You’s cry sounded. Wave after wave of black fog surged out of its body in all directions. Miserable screeches echoed across the sky. If one were to look carefully, one would discover that the black fog was being formed by an unimaginable number of souls. “Bang bang bang!” Countless numbers of souls gushed out. They suddenly exploded upon contact with the golden flame. The force from the self-detonation of such a large number of souls caused even the golden sea of fire to blast apart. The moment this occurred, the body of the black skeleton suddenly shrank. In the blink of an eye, it had transformed from ten thousand feet tall to a hundred feet tall. Although its body had shrunk, the skeleton had grown even darker. A frighteningly dark and chilly energy slowly spread from the skeleton’s body. “Tsk tsk… just watch as I tear part this fire formation of yours!” The skeleton slowly lifted its head. Its jaw moved as it emitted a strange laugh. That laugh was the voice of Gu You. This old man had managed to merge his soul with the skeleton. Xun Er’s expression was slightly altered after she heard these words. Her pretty eyes slid to where Gu You was located earlier. An elderly figure was standing at that spot, but both of the elderly figure’s eyes appeared vacant. Clearly, the figure was only an empty shell. The words of the black skeleton had just sounded when it flashed and appeared at the edge of the fire formation. Its palm, which contained a rich black light, gently cut across the fire curtain. A crack line slowly appeared. The relaxed cut clearly indicated that the black skeleton did not meet even the slightest obstruction. “Boom!” The fire formation seemed to have been destroyed after this tear appeared. It let out a ‘boom’ and exploded in front of many pairs of eyes. “Little girl, if you had advanced to the Ban Sheng class, it would be difficult to determine just who would win today. Unfortunately…” The black skeleton’s green eyes stared at Xun Er while a hoarse voice was slowly emitted. The corner of Xun Er’s mouth was lifted despite hearing this. She softly said, “My intentions were not to defeat you. I have already completed my task…” Xun Er’s delicate figure quickly withdrew after she spoke. She appeared behind Xiao Yan in a flash. At this moment, there was an exquisite artistic-looking fire lotus slowly rotating in his palm. An annihilation aura slowly spread, causing the surrounding space to distort. A hoarse voice was slowly emitted from the black skeleton as it looked at the fire lotus in Xiao Yan’s hand. “Is this the thing that you create after merging Heavenly Flames? I have given you so much time. Hopefully, you will not disappoint me…” [a]It was five clusters last chapter [b]Green Core Flame Fallen Heart Flame Bone Chilling Flame Ten Thousand Burning Flame Not sure if the fifth was some other flame he added in before... [c]I think at this point it was the fake heavenly flame that he was using to make the lotus a little stronger.
