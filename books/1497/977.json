His gaze looked to the northern sky and his brows were knit slightly as sunlight landed on his face. At this moment, the face of this expert suddenly revealed hesitation and regret. It was likely that this expression would cause his opponents to feel extremely shocked. This unusually merciless person could actually make such an expression. The Han clan being held under house arrest by the Wind Lightning Pavilion was indeed something that Xiao Yan had not expected. After all, regardless of how one put it, the Han clan possessed quite some weight within Tian Bei City. Moreover, they did not intervene in this matter. Unexpectedly, the bastards from the Wind Lightning Pavilion were acting in such a despicable way. The aim of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, by spreading news that the the Han clan was held under house arrest, was something obvious, not even worth mentioning. They wanted to force Xiao Yan to reveal himself and rescue them. Xiao Yan was certain that Tian Bei City was likely already occupied by the experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion at this moment. The moment he revealed himself, it was likely that he would end up facing an extremely intense battle. Currently, Tian Bei City had already become a trap, waiting for Xiao Yan to fall into. This trap was not really hidden by the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Moreover, it was also impossible for them to hide it. Even ordinary people were aware of what it was. How was it possible for Xiao Yan not to realize it? If one were to really talk about it, it was impossible for the other party to completely ignore such an action unless that person was cold-hearted. This so-called trap would naturally be ineffective on people like that. However, Xiao Yan wasn’t not a cold-hearted person. Towards enemies, he might have been able to be cold-hearted. However, to normal people or those that he knew, he was extremely kind and this personality of his allowed him to have quite a few friends and experts gathering around him. People like Hai Bodong, Little Fairy, Queen Medusa to even the Tian Huo zun-zhe all felt this. Those who were cold hearted to even their friends would have trouble getting others to treat them genuinely. This point was part of Xiao Yan’s charm. Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath and sighed, “The Wind Lightning Pavilion is really hateful. It wants to force me out. In that case, I will do as they wish…” “Little Fellow, do you intend to head to Tian Bei City? That place is definitely filled with experts now.” An elderly laugh sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart. “A great man has things that he can do and cannot do. This matter is something that was stirred by me. Given my character, it is difficult for me to just stand idly by the side…” Xiao Yan softly replied. “Ke ke, these words are indeed true. The old me hates the kind of people who implicate their friends and end up acting in a timid manner. Although you are quite young, you really suit the taste of the old me. If you had not mentioned that you already have a teacher, you would not be a bad choice for a disciple.” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed heartily. “Mister Yao has overpraised me.” Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. His shoulders shook and a pair of crystal bone wings slowly spread apart. He smiled and said, “In that case, let’s get moving…” “Relax, as long as the old me is around, I will guarantee that nothing will harm you as long as we do not meet an expert at the peak of the Dou Zong class.” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed loudly. “In that case, I will thank old mister Yao…” Xiao Yan also laughed out loud. He raised his head and looked over the endless sea of lush green trees. A pride involuntarily surged in his heart, and he let out a clear roar toward the sky. The shout was like the cry of a crane that clearly reverberated unceasingly over the sea of trees. “Even if your Wind Lightning Pavilion has turned Tian Bei City into an extremely dangerous place, I, Xiao Yan, will still not be afraid!” The cry slowly sounded before the bone wings on Xiao Yan’s back were flapped. His body transformed into a ray of light that flashed toward Tian Bei City… ........ The atmosphere within Tian Bei City was somewhat strange during these few days. This was because everyone knew that quite a number of experts from the Tian Bei City had hurried over upon orders. They had caused the many factions within the city to become anxious. With the strength of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, they would not possess even the slightest qualification to resist if the Wind Lightning Pavilion wanted to expel them. Fortunately, however, the thing that they were worried about did not occur. The experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion did not do anything to them. The first thing these people did upon arrival was lock up the Han clan’s manor. No one could leave or enter. The entire clan was imprisoned in the manor. Although the Han clan possessed quite a great strength within Tian Bei City, they did not pose much of a threat to the Wind Lightning Pavilion. The grand Elder of the Han clan, Han Fei, might have fought with the experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion in anger back then, but he could only give up despite feeling suffocated in his heart when the three Elders from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion attacked together. His strength could at the very most fight with a single Elder. He would definitely be defeated if the three were to attack together. However, it was not as though Han Fei’s resistance did not have any effect. The experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion merely sealed off the entrances and exits, and did not barge into the manor. This caused the Han clan to feel a little better. The members of the Han clan clearly understood the intentions of the actions by the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion this time around. They wanted to use this to force Xiao Yan, who was hiding in an unknown location, out. However, other than a few people, most of the members of the Han clan did not think that Xiao Yan would really show himself because of this. At this moment, there were quite a number of elite disciples from the Wind Lightning Pavilion within Tian Bei City. Most importantly, there were the three Elders, Feng, Lei, and Dian. The strengths of these three people was a little stronger than Chen Yun. Unless it was some old demon of the Dou Zong class, very few people could fight with them when they joined hands. Even if Xiao Yan possessed the frightening strength to kill Chen Yun, it was likely that he would find it difficult to fight against these three renowned Elders from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion… Of course, it was not only the members of the Han clan who were making guesses. The entire Tian Bei City and some other cities, who had heard rumors, were all trying to figure out if Xiao Yan would really turn up. However, most of the people guessed that Xiao Yan would not appear. After all, from the way they saw it, not many people, who were thinking straight, would dare to charge into the dangerous grounds even if he was the young man called Xiao Yan, who had given them a great shock on the Sky Stone Stage back then. Seven days passed by quickly while a countless number of people were engaged in discussions. Tian Bei City was as quiet as it was before these seven days. The big battle that they had imagined did not arrive. Immediately, quite a number of people became disappointed as a result. It seemed that Xiao Yan really did not dare to come… Sometimes, humans were a very strange creature. When they made uncertain guesses earlier, they thought that Xiao Yan charging in was an extremely foolish idea. Now, after having ascertained that he would not appear, they could not help but feel disappointed. They even quietly felt a little disdain. Their hearts had placed a charge of abandoning one’s friends on Xiao Yan’s head. .......... A graceful pretty figure was seated on a stone chair in a small serene courtyard within the Han clan’s manor. Her pretty eyes was a little absent-minded as they wandered the room. The current Han Xue was much skinnier than before. Although she still emitted a coldness, she appeared a little more moving and pitiful. Han Xue softly sighed as her pretty eyes focused for a moment. “Xue-er, you have been running here everyday…” A soft helpless voice sounded from behind Han Xue while she was sighing. Han Xue turned her head and discovered that it was Han Yue. Han Xue’s pretty face turned slightly red. She looked at the pity on Han Yue’s face when she clenched her hand and suddenly asked, “Elder sister, do you think… will he come?” Han Yue was startled when she heard this. Seven days had already passed by, and there had been no news of Xiao Yan. Given her understanding of Xiao Yan, he was not a heartless person. However, the few day’s wait had caused the confidence in her heart to sway significantly. “He should… will likely come.” Han Yue finally said after hesitating for a moment. “I hope that he won’t come… those three old fellows from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion are people whom even great-grandfather greatly fears. Although Xiao Yan is very strong, he is likely no match for the three old fellows…” Han Xue’s long eyelashes blinked gently as she softly spoke. “Won’t you be very disappointed if he really doesn’t come? Won’t you feel as though you have misjudged him?” Han Yue raised her bright eyes and asked with a smile. Han Xue knit her brows slightly. This question really caused her to feel quite distressed. However, she still nodded her head seriously a moment later. She said, “I will be a little disappointed… but I still hope that he won’t come…” “Foolish girl…” Han Yue shook her head. She rubbed Han Xue’s black hair and comforted her with a smile, “Relax, the prince in your heart will arrive in Tian Bei City with his beautiful bone wings, and beat the crap out of these bastards from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion.” Han Xue involuntarily smiled sweetly upon hearing this. She extended her arms and wrapped them around Han Yue’s narrow waist. Her head leaned against Han Yue’s shoulder and her pretty eyes contained some moisture. Using a voice that only she could hear, Han Xue softly muttered, “Please do not come…” “Bang!” Han Xue had just finished muttering to herself when a rumbling thunder suddenly resounded in the sky above Tian Bei City. Immediately, the entire city could sense a majestic aura that was not the least bit hidden rushing toward the city in an extremely quick manner. The entire Tian Bei City had descended into an uproar when this aura had just appeared. Numerous stunned gazes looked in the direction the aura originated from. A ray of light was cutting through the air in a lightning-like manner from that direction. “Xiao Yan? He has really come?” “This fellow really does have some courage. Ha ha, looks like the old me has won my bet this time around…” Tian Bei City, which had been quiet for a couple of days, seemed to have recovered at this instant. Numerous heated gazes looked to the sky outside of the city. They knew that Tian Bei City would no longer be quiet today… Three old men on the top of three trees around the Han clan’s manor instantly opened their eyes when the aura had appeared. They slowly raised their heads and looked into the distance. A cold smile appeared on their old faces. “Is he finally about to arrive…” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-977","bookId":1497,"book":{"id":1497,"title":"Battle Through the Heavens","description":"In a land where no magic is present.
