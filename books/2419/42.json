The brass—they\u0027re willing to assume it\u0027s Ruby McBride, but things were done ... I don\u0027t know how much you noticed underwater, but\n things were intentionally done to the body to make the ID hard. It\u0027ll be days before we get enough medical records together, call in the forensic anthropologists to be sure.\"\n \"You can\u0027t have any doubt,\" I said. \"You saw the way she was. Right at the base of that tree. She was . . . placed. Displayed. And you know Garrett didn\u0027t do that.\"\n \"Which is why I\u0027m on leave,\" Lopez said. \"I told my bosses we were chasing the wrong guy.\"\n \"You told the truth.\"\n Lopez laughed without humour. \"Good old truth. Ain\u0027t what the brass wants, especially when they\u0027ve got a fugitive suspect with no alibis, solid ballistics work to place him at at least one homicide. Good motives for both homicides. A friend that works the docks for McBride, could give him access. The DA likes all that just fine. His point of view—it doesn\u0027t take much to dump a woman\u0027s body overboard. Even a guy in a wheelchair could do it. Especially with the drugs in her system. It would look very bad on the Channel 4 news if the department backed down, reconsidered pressing charges.\"\n \"Drugs.\"\n Lopez brought out a sheaf of papers.\n \"I wasn\u0027t even supposed to get these. A guy I know in Toxicology, he ran me a copy.\"\n He flipped a few pages, handed me one. \"Check the spike graphs.\"\n I couldn\u0027t tell much about the chemical names, the abbreviations, the numbers, but one thing was clear. \"They\u0027re the same.\"\n Lopez nodded. \"The one on the left shows the levels of the alcohol and tricyclic antidepressants in Jimmy Doebler\u0027s blood. The one on the right shows the levels in the female victim. They match. Now check the next page.\"\n Another match. The date on this one was much older—May 1995.\n \"Clara?\"\n \"I had my friend pull that out of the archived records. That\u0027s her tox report.\"\n \"Three people,\" I said. \"Virtually identical graphs.\"\n Lopez nodded. \"Taken separately, they can be explained. Jimmy and Clara both were on medication. If victim three is Ruby, she was on the same stuff. But taken together—we\u0027ve got a poisoner. He\u0027s doing an extraction process with the amitriptyline, dissolving it\n down to lethal concentration, mixing it with alcohol for quick dissemination. These three people were poisoned with the same recipe. Ninetynine to one—by the same person.\"\n I looked across the plaza. The musician was playing Pete Seeger. Even the pigeons made a wide arc around him.\n \"Jimmy\u0027s past,\" I said. \"Clara\u0027s missing child.\"\n Lopez stared at the pigeons. \"I don\u0027t know, Navarre. I still don\u0027t like it. But let\u0027s say the killer uses drugs to make the victims pliable. They get sleepy, almost comatose—they follow simple instructions. He can manipulate them. My bosses would tell you this explains a lot about how your brother could do this. Me, I\u0027d agree with your friend, Miss Lee. I think this bastard wants to talk with his victims. He wants to get intimate before he kills them. I think the old guy in Waco, Ewin Lowry, I think that was our boy\u0027s first attempt. It left a bad taste in his mouth, didn\u0027t satisfy his urges. So he refined his strategy.\"\n \"He started drugging them.\"\n The musician kept playing his harmonica music.\n \"W.B. Doebler,\" I said. \"Has anyone interviewed him since Jimmy\u0027s death?\"\n \"No need,\" Lopez said. \"W.B. calls the sheriff every other day for updates. I don\u0027t know what gets said. I know Sheriff\u0027s an honourable person.\"\n He didn\u0027t need to say more. We both knew the reality—a rich family, heavy political connections. Getting the Sheriff\u0027s Department to expand a criminal investigation to include W.B. Doebler would take incontrovertible proof and signatures in triplicate from God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.\n \"Something else, though,\" Lopez said. \"Pena\u0027s girlfriend, the night she drowned. We know now that his alibi is for shit. One thing the witness statements all agreed on: Adrienne Selak had had too much to drink. She kept slurring her words, losing her balance. Pena himself stated that he had to support her several times to keep her from falling over. She got very drunk very fast.\"\n \"As if Adrienne Selak had been given an amitriptyline cocktail.\"\n Lopez nodded.\n \"But it\u0027s all still speculation,\" I said. \"Garrett\u0027s been missing over twentyfour hours. I have to find him before your colleagues\n do. If he could trace the Techsan sabotage to Pena—it\u0027s a long shot, but it might be some leverage.\"\n Pena picked at the knee of his camouflage pants. \"Which brings me to my last point. I put out feelers on Garrett\u0027s whereabouts early yesterday. This morning a CI of mine, local biker—he gave me a tip where your brother might be. Of course, he didn\u0027t know I\u0027d been pulled off the case. Ethically, I should hand the information over to my superiors.\"\n \"Ethically.\"\n Lopez\u0027s eyes glittered like a crocodile\u0027s. \"My CI tells me your brother\u0027s hiding out with the Diablos. They got a whole network of safe houses. As of this morning, they moved him into a place where they figured nobody will look for him—the marina.\"\n \"You must have that place under surveillance.\"\n \"Boats go in. Boats go out. You know the guy who runs the docks, it would be pretty easy to come and go unseen. We can\u0027t search every boat, not without cause. I should tell my sergeant what I know, let him make the call.\"\n I thought about what Travis County would do, how they would proceed against a suspected murderer hiding out with a motorcycle gang. They would activate SWAT.\n They would go in hard and fast. They would be quick to shoot and they\u0027d cry no tears if there was any resistance.\n \"I\u0027ll go to the marina with you,\" I told Lopez. \"But you forgot one thing.\"\n The cords of his neck muscles stood out like bridge cables. \"Yeah?\"\n \"Clara Doebler supposedly killed herself,\" I said. \"Unless you saw something that night you didn\u0027t put in the report.\"\n Something in Lopez\u0027s demeanour changed, like a tide reversing, drawing back in.\n \"Heard,\" Lopez murmured. \"I heard something. And yes, Navarre, I reported it. Every day for five years, I\u0027ve tried to convince myself that my superiors were right—that I was imagining things. I went along with what the brass told me. I went along with my shrink, telling me it was just frayed nerves. But when I walked up to Clara Doebler that night, while she was writing her suicide note, I could hear her talking—whimpering, almost.\n There was nobody\n with her. If there had been, for me not to see them, they would\u0027ve had to have been in the trees—ten, fifteen feet away, standing in total darkness. But just for a second, as I was coming up, I could swear I heard a second voice. A man\u0027s voice. Real gentle.\"\n The tide was still pulling in Lopez\u0027s direction, washing out the patio stones under my feet.\n \"What did the voice say?\" I managed.\n Lopez shifted, pulled the sunglasses off his shirt collar.\n \"It wasn\u0027t a conversation, Navarre. More like the voice was instructing Clara Doebler, telling her what to write.\"\n Date:Thurs 15 Jun 2000 03:17:54 0500 From:\n [email protected]\n /* */ ReplyTo: none XMailer: Mozilla 4.7 (Macintosh? I? PPC) XAcceptLanguage: en To:\n [email protected]\n /* */ Subject: search patterns\n What was the hardest part, Detective?\n Talking to the family? Those pinched faces. The old grandmother crying, cupping her hands over a grimace. They are chattering at you in Chinese, and the ones who can translate, the adolescents, are telling you with embarrassment that the family believes in evil spirits, that something down there took a liking to their child.\n The victim\u0027s family always wants so much from you. You arrive on the scene and they have knives and forks ready to dig in—taking whatever they can from you. They want reassurance. They want answers. They want you to bring their little boy back to life.\n And so you dive, day after day—such a small area on the surface, one little cove in one public park. You could throw a football across it and hit the opposite bank. But you dive the entire area and find nothing. You comfort yourself with formulas, buoyancy charts, DPS manuals that tell you where the body should be, what it should look like, how the currents might have moved it. But you find nothing.\n Every evening you come up from your third, maybe fourth dive that day, and the family is still there, holding vigil on the shore, looking for any sign—anything in your face, any gesture.\n You have to be a wall, completely impassive. You wish somebody would tell the family,\n \"You don\u0027t want to be here. You don\u0027t want to see the thing when we finally find it.\" You wish you could tell them that the real find will be quiet. When it happens, the diver will say nothing. He will quietly direct the boat around, place it between the spectators and the surface site. They will bag the body underwater. They will do everything they can to keep it hidden.\n You can\u0027t tell the family that. The only thing they want to hear is the one thing you can\u0027t tell them—that their kid is okay.\n But that\u0027s not the hardest part, is it? The job isn\u0027t so bad. It\u0027s a community project.\n You\u0027re never alone, never more than a few inches from the neon gloves of the next diver on the line. You can think of the lake in grids, tidily partitioned by weights and yellow strings, flags and GPS coordinates. It\u0027s impersonal. Scientific. And when the time comes to call it quits, to face the facts that enough taxpayer money has gone toward finding one little Chinese boy, that eventually he\u0027ll surface anyway—the decision isn\u0027t yours. You don\u0027t have to tell the family. You just roll up your line, fold the unused body bag.\n Afterward, you sit on the rocks at sunset, thinking about the boy, what he must have felt like that Saturday—a sunny picnic, the cool water such a welcome relief after lunch, no one worried about that extra hot dog he ate. Maybe he heard his mom calling to him—\"Be careful.\" And he looked down the shore, way out past the bend where the rich yachters were eating lunch on the decks of the restaurant, and he thought how fun it would be to go there. It didn\u0027t look far.\n That moment comes when you realize what the kid was doing, what he felt like when he ate water, then found he couldn\u0027t surface.\n And for all your mapping, your talks with the parents, your days of searching—it all comes down to one horrible realization. You\u0027re alone, and you decide to do one more dive.\n You find him there, the glint of his gold necklace in your flash light. The rest of him is fuzzy, white, unhuman—a child turning into a cloud.\n And rationally, you realize what happened. He dove under the deck, thinking of the novelty of swimming beneath a building. He didn\u0027t realize the old spools of wire were down there, bricks, fishnets, hooks, crayfish traps. And then he became tangled, and realized that the sounds above him were the last he would ever hear— people walking, the voices of diners, the clink of dropped plates, all amplified through the aluminium pontoon floats and the water. He drowned in the dark, and stayed there for days while above him, rich folk toasted the sunset with Chardonnay. Yacht purchases were discussed. Engagement rings were unveiled over crabcakes and microbrewery beer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-42.html","bookId":2419,"book":{"id":2419,"title":"The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4) \n Rick Riordan, triple-crown winner of the Edgar, Anthony, and Shamus Awards, brings his fast-talking, hard-living, Texas-hip P.I.
