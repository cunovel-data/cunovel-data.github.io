{"id":76520,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Garrett needs a lawyer.\" Lopez bopped his fists together, hotpotato style. \" \u0027Course not, Mr. Navarre. I appreciate y\u0027all\u0027s candour. And I promise you: I will nail Jimmy Doebler\u0027s killer.\" \"You treat every case with this much enthusiasm?\" \"I knew Jimmy. I liked Jimmy. I used to work patrol out at the lake, knew all the folks out that way.\" \"And his family has a few gazillion dollars,\" I added. \"Jimmy\u0027s cousin was talking to the sheriff today.\" A safety valve clicked shut in Lopez\u0027s eyes. \"W.B. Doebler isn\u0027t my concern.\" Lopez gave the initials their proper Texas pronunciation, dubyabee. \"You know Jimmy, you know he had a pretty shitty life—that family of his, the stuff with his mom, the clinical depression. Seemed like he was finally coming out of it when he got roped into this business deal with your brother.\" He let his smile creep back to full intensity. \"But hey, that doesn\u0027t matter. Jimmy and Garrett were quarrelling, your brother was mad enough to discharge a weapon, I\u0027m sure that\u0027s not important.\" I looked back at our driver, who was staring at me through the windshield—giving me the look of death. \"Don\u0027t mind him,\" Lopez said. \"Some of the guys, they heard about that little accident down in Bexar County, you shooting that deputy. Doesn\u0027t play well with the uniforms. You understand.\" \"And with you?\" Lopez made a pish sound. \"I got no sympathy for bad cops. That asshole was corrupt: you took him down. Good for you. I believe in weeding out the bad, Navarre. Don\u0027t care if it\u0027s a friend or a relative or what. I hope we\u0027re on the same page with that.\" I looked up toward Garrett\u0027s apartment door. \"I\u0027m on your side, man,\" Lopez assured me. \"I wouldn\u0027t want this to get around, but the people I know in San Antonio—they say you\u0027re all right. They say when it comes down to a fight, you\u0027re a guy who can be counted on to choose the right team.\" \"I see your point,\" I said. \"We wouldn\u0027t want that to get around.\" \"You got my card.\" Lopez turned to go, then looked back, as if he\u0027d forgotten something. I hate it when cops do that. \"And Navarre? The discrepancies in those statements you and your brother gave us? I\u0027m not thinking much of them. For instance— were you with your brother when you heard the shot or not?\" I didn\u0027t answer. \"I don\u0027t know why your brother failed to mention that he and Jimmy were arguing at dinner, like you told me. It\u0027s probably nothing. Just—bad form when the statements don\u0027t agree, isn\u0027t it? I hate going back later, using WiteOut.\" \"I know my brother.\" Lopez smiled. \"Of course you do. Where does he work again— RNI? Oh, no. That\u0027s right. He quit that job over a year ago.\" Up on the secondfloor walkway, one of the apartment residents waddled out in his jockey shorts and a tattered Waterloo Tshirt. He yelled down to us that his neighbour was throwing his sofa off the back balcony and we should stop him. Lopez grinned. He told the guy he would have to phone it in to the APD dispatcher. The guy began cursing at us. Lopez gave me a wink. \"My point is—an okay guy like you, you could help me out a lot, maybe help your brother, too. We could be straight with each other and get this thing resolved. You could give Garrett some advice on how to play it. If there were hard choices to make, I trust you would make them.\" \"You want my brother in jail, Lopez?\" He laughed. \"They told me you had a sense of humour. That\u0027s great. See you around, Mr. Navarre.\" Then he climbed into the patrol car. I watched it back up, disappear around the corner of 24th. The guy on the second floor kept yelling at me to come stop his neighbour from pitching his furniture off the balcony. Every day is a love fest when you live at The Friends. CHAPTER 5 Garrett hadn\u0027t hired a maid since my last visit, five months ago. Fastfood containers littered the kitchen counter. The living room was a tornado zone of paperback novels, electronics parts, CDs, laundry. A dead tequila bottle stuck out from the seat of our father\u0027s old leather recliner and the carpet was fuzzy with birdseed from Dickhead the parrot, who scuttled back and forth on the window ledge at the top of the vaulted ceiling. Garrett sat in the far corner of the room, staring at his twenty oneinch computer monitor. \"Computers get static?\" I asked. The gray fuzzy light made Garrett\u0027s face crawl, his eyes hollow. \"Not usually.\" He slammed the monitor\u0027s off button. \"I need a drink.\" I waited for him to explain the computer problem. Not that I would\u0027ve understood the explanation, but that was something Garrett always did. This time, he didn\u0027t. I went to the bar, got down his bottle of Herradura Anejo and a couple of moderately clean glasses. \"Detective Lopez just got through telling how much you\u0027re not a suspect in Jimmy\u0027s murder. He was very agreeable about it. I got the feeling he\u0027d let you plea just about any degree of homicide you wanted.\" Garrett took the tequila. \"Lopez has had a hardon for me for years.\" \"Really.\" \"Don\u0027t give me that tone—like you assume I\u0027m stoned. Back when Lopez was on patrol, he made a lot of calls to Jimmy\u0027s place, had to chew us out for drunkanddisorderly crap. We got into some namecalling. But you know I didn\u0027t kill Jimmy. I couldn\u0027t.\" I drank my Herradura, found it made a pretty bad chaser for garlic bagels. \"Lopez gives you credit for mobility—a lot more credit than he\u0027s giving our statements.\" Garrett shoved his keyboard drawer closed. \"Somebody finally believes in me, and it\u0027s a homicide cop.\" I ran my finger across the kitchen counter, making a cross with a dustless shadow where a picture frame had stood for a long time. I remembered the photograph. It had been the twin of the one in Jimmy\u0027s house—Garrett and Jimmy at the seawall in Corpus, a year or so before Garrett\u0027s accident. \"W.B. Doebler was at the sheriff\u0027s office,\" I told him. \"If the Doeblers start throwing their weight around, demanding action—\" \"Fuck W.B. It\u0027s a little late for the Doeblers to decide they care about Jimmy.\" \"You need help, Garrett.\" \"And I don\u0027t recall asking you for any, little bro. I\u0027ll make the calls. I\u0027ll take care of things.\" \"What—you\u0027re going to buy a bigger gun?\" \"Forget it, man. You didn\u0027t like the ranch being mortgaged. You ain\u0027t going to like the rest of this.\" \"I didn\u0027t drive up here to build a kiln, Garrett. I sure as hell didn\u0027t drive up here to sit on the sidelines while they charge you with murder.\" Garrett dug out his wallet, pulled a twenty and wadded it up, threw it at me. \"Gas money. Sorry I wasted your time.\" I counted silently to ten. Every second was one more I succeeded in not putting my fist through my brother\u0027s wall. The downstairs neighbours cranked up their stereo. Nine Inch Nails throbbed through the carpet. Up on the windowsill, the parrot ruffled his feathers. \"Let\u0027s try to cooperate,\" I said. \"For Jimmy\u0027s sake. You told them you were with me when that shot was fired. Your book was face down on the sleeping bag when I woke up. You were already gone. Where the hell were you?\" Garrett wore last night\u0027s cutoffs, and when he shifted, the stub of his right leg peeked through at the end—a pointed nub of flesh like a mole\u0027s nose. \"I was sleeping in my van. With the doors locked.\" \"Why?\" He rubbed his thumb against his forefingers, rolling an imaginary joint. \"In Jimmy\u0027s house, I woke up in a cold sweat. I have phantom pains and I get these weird dreams—like somebody has been standing over me in my sleep. I would\u0027ve felt stupid waking you up. I thought Jimmy was sleeping upstairs. So I went to the one place I feel safe and mobile—behind the wheel of my van. I locked myself in, put my gun on the seat next to me, went to sleep. The shot by the water woke me up. What was I going to tell the police? I was afraid of ghosts so I locked myself in my car?\" \"It would\u0027ve been better than lying, Garrett. I\u0027m going to need an explanation for Detective Lopez.\" His eyes flared. \"You need an explanation. Well, let\u0027s just stop the goddamn world. Let\u0027s drop everything and make sure Tres is okay, because my little brother needs an explanation. He needs the ranch. He needs to know where Garrett is twentyfour hours a day. Well, maybe for once, little brother, you ain\u0027t going to get everything you need.\" The counting wasn\u0027t helping anymore. Downstairs, Nine Inch Nails went into their next song, the bass line massaging the soles of my boots. \"Did you see anyone last night?\" I asked. \"No.\" \"You must suspect someone. The banker guy.\" \"Matthew Pena,\" Garrett murmured. There was something in his voice I hadn\u0027t heard often—pure hate. \"You think he\u0027s capable of murder,\" I said. \"An investment banker?\" Garrett pressed his palms against his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"What about Jimmy\u0027s ex? Ruby McBride?\" He hesitated. \"No. No way.\" \"But?\" Garrett stared at his monitor. \"There are reasons I didn\u0027t talk to you sooner, little bro. Not just because I wanted you in the dark.\" \"I snoop for a living, Garrett. Let me help.\" \"In all the years Dad was sheriff, do you ever recall me asking him for help?\" \"Maybe you should have. He would\u0027ve done damn near anything if you\u0027d ever called.\" \"Here it comes, the guilt trip from the good son. Forget it. I don\u0027t want you in my problems because I don\u0027t want you hurt, man. And believe me, you would get hurt.\" I looked at Garrett\u0027s clock—Dad\u0027s clock. I\u0027d been in Austin twentyfive hours. The ranch was still mortgaged. Jimmy Doebler was dead. My brother\u0027s life was falling apart. And he didn\u0027t want me involved because I might get hurt. I set my shot glass on Dad\u0027s army locker, which served as Garrett\u0027s makeshift coffee table. I stared at Dad\u0027s recliner, thought about Dad\u0027s old saddle that hung on Garrett\u0027s bedroom wall. Not for the first time, I had to swallow back a comment about hypocrisy. Garrett always insisted I\u0027d been Dad\u0027s favourite, the model son, and yet I owned almost nothing of the Sheriff\u0027s. Garrett, who had always railed that he wanted nothing to do with our father, lived surrounded by his things. \"You don\u0027t want my help,\" I said, \"at least get a lawyer. You want some names?\" He gave me an uneasy look. \"I told you, man. I\u0027ll handle it.\" \"Fine,\" I said. \"Just primo.\" I was halfway out the front door when he called, \"Tres.\" The sun through the skylights made his beard glow almost blond. \"You\u0027re right about cooperating for Jimmy\u0027s sake,\" he told me. \"But you\u0027ve got to trust me, little bro. I\u0027ve got to handle this without you. I just can\u0027t—\" He looked at me as if he was trying to explain a smashed vase. \"Do you understand?\" \"I\u0027m trying, Garrett. I am.\" He held my eyes, searching for some stronger commitment. When he didn\u0027t find it, he turned and wheeled himself into the bedroom. I pulled his front door locked behind me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-5.html","bookId":2419,"book":{"id":2419,"title":"The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4)","description":"Storyline: The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4) Rick Riordan, triple-crown winner of the Edgar, Anthony, and Shamus Awards, brings his fast-talking, hard-living, Texas-hip P.I.
