I rose to my elbows, wiped a trail of blood off my upper lip, and looked up at Maia, who was holding Clyde\u0027s revolver, the barrel pointed out over the lake.\n \"That\u0027s it, gentlemen,\" she told us. \"You are now above water. Above water, I am the queen almighty. And the queen says no fighting. Any questions?\"\n I shook my head.\n Lopez rubbed his jaw, stepped carefully to the bar and grabbed a bottle of vodka.\n \"What the hell do you mean hitting me, Navarre? Me, who just tried to save your sorryass life.\"\n \"Fucking fascist cop,\" Clyde growled.\n Maia said, \"Drink something, Clyde. Gin?\"\n \"I hate gin.\"\n She tossed him the bottle anyway. He caught it, uncapped it and drank.\n She didn\u0027t even ask what I wanted. She tossed me a fifth of Cuervo Gold.\n We all drank, except for Maia. The gun was enough for her.\n I glowered at Lopez. \"You were saving me, huh?\"\n \"Yeah. Not that it was worth it.\"\n \"That what you were doing with the knife, Vic? Saving me?\"\n Maia watched for signs of new trouble, but Lopez just shook his head in disgust.\n He stormed over to where my gear lay and yanked a broken branch as thick as a golf club out of my BC strap.\n \"Actually yes, Navarre. You stupid son of a bitch. I was trying to cut you free. And three tugs—that\u0027s your signal to call me in, not the other way around. You never leave the main line. Never. I was asking you for more slack so I could cut the corpse free, put a loop around it. Now Search and Recovery\u0027s going to have to do it, and you and I just royally fucked up an underwater crime scene.\"\n Maia watched both of us, unsure what to do. Clyde looked like his only uncertainty was deciding which of us to kill first.\n I said, \"Lopez, I\u0027m—\"\n I couldn\u0027t make myself say it.\n Clyde spat a mouthful of gin over the side. \"Somebody\u0027s going to pay, Lopez.\n Somebody\u0027s going to pay for Ruby, and his name ain\u0027t going to be Navarre.\"\n \"Shut up,\" Maia decided. \"Let\u0027s just shut up.\"\n And we did.\n We paced around the deck in hostile silence, Maia holding the gun, the rest of us drinking liquor from the Flagship of Fun\u0027s premiumstocked bar while the sirens of the LCRA and Sheriff\u0027s Department boats got closer and closer over the water.\n CHAPTER 35\n The Flagship of Fun was tame compared to the party the media was throwing.\n We made shore at Windy Point around four o\u0027clock, hoping to evade the bulk of spectators and reporters. No such luck. The Point\u0027s foottrafficonly road was lined with news vans from Austin, Waco, San Antonio—all the network affiliates and several cable stations.\n The usual contingent of scubacampers looked bewildered by the invasion.\n Cameramen clambered around, knocking over air tanks and pup tents, setting up portable generators and satellite dishes and tripod lights. Reporters fussed with their makeup, lamented their winddestroyed hairdos, and forcefed microphones to anyone and everyone coming up the ladder from the water.\n Maia and I got through the gauntlet only because Vic Lopez was right behind us.\n \"Detective!\"\n And the feeding frenzy began. The reporters\u0027 questions told me that every important fact had already leaked out. A woman\u0027s body had been recovered from one hundred feet of water. She had been stabbed, weighted down. Had she been dumped overboard? Had the body been positively identified as Ruby McBride, exwife of the recently murdered Jimmy Doebler? Was it true her former business partner Garrett Navarre, already a suspect in Doebler\u0027s murder, was still at large?\n As Maia and I were leaving, the PR director for the Sheriff\u0027s Department was trying to organize the chaos into a formal news\n conference. He got a lieutenant and a couple of sergeants to line up on one side of him, Lopez on the other side.\n From the expressions of the brass, I got the feeling Lopez would\u0027ve gotten chewed into catfish bait had the press not been present. But the press was present, so Lopez was the star of the moment.\n I gave Maia the keys to my truck. The rain started to fall.\n While Maia drove, we listened to the news conference live on an AM station. The police refused to release the identity of the victim. They refused to speculate on suspects, though they promised they were \"actively pursuing leads.\" I tried to focus on the hills, the trees, the arc of rain outside the sweep of the windshield wipers—anything but what had happened at the bottom of the lake.\n The anger had left me. Nitrogen was venting from my system, sapping every bit of energy my body had left. I drifted in and out of sleep.\n When Maia and I got back to Jimmy\u0027s dome, my need for a scuba nap overrode all other concerns. I crawled up the ladder to the sleeping loft and passed out.\n I\u0027m not sure how long I was unconscious. When I opened my eyes the daylight was gone. Rain pounded steadily on the roof of the dome.\n Maia\u0027s voice said, \"I was about to put a spoon under your nose, check if you were still breathing.\"\n I looked toward my feet. She was sitting on the corner of the bed, Robert Johnson pacing back and forth on her knees, purring smugly.\n I grabbed an extra pillow, stuffed it behind my head. \"News?\"\n \"Not much. Lopez called, said he was taking a lot of heat. Said he should have the ME\u0027s report by morning.\"\n \"Garrett?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. Nothing.\"\n I studied the Beatles poster on the ceiling. The Fab Four looked mad at me.\n \"It isn\u0027t your fault,\" Maia said. \"If nothing else, it got Lopez on your side.\"\n \"Yeah, the minute I punched him.\"\n \"He knows Garrett couldn\u0027t do . . . what you saw down there. There\u0027s no way. Lopez got a revised statement from Dwight about\n Adrienne Selak\u0027s drowning. He\u0027s talking to SFPD. Momentum is starting to shift.\"\n The rain kept drumming on the roof. The only one comfortable in the loft seemed to be Robert Johnson, now snugly nestled in Maia\u0027s lap, getting his ears scratched.\n \"Ruby wanted to fix things,\" I said. \"She met with Pena, tried to reverse her deal with him. But she wasn\u0027t any use to him anymore. So he killed her. Just like Adrienne.\"\n Maia picked at a fold in the bedspread. \"We don\u0027t even know it\u0027s her yet, Tres. The condition of the body—\"\n \"Yes, we do.\"\n \"We\u0027ll bring Pena down.\"\n \"You were right. It would have been better if I\u0027d stayed out of this, let you handle it.\"\n \"No,\" she said. \"That was my bitterness talking.\"\n She slid Robert Johnson out of her lap, scooted onto the bed, lay down next to me.\n She put her arm across my chest, her chin resting on my shoulder.\n We lay like that, the fan at the top of the dome pin wheeling shadows across the ceiling, for a long time. I thought about dark green water through the branches of frozen pecan trees.\n She kissed my neck. \"Stop, okay?\"\n \"Stop what?\"\n \"Thinking.\"\n She slid the sheet down, away from my chest.\n \"You\u0027re running up a bill at the Driskill,\" I said. \"For a room you aren\u0027t using.\"\n \"Mmhmm.\"\n She put a finger on my chest, ran it up to my collarbone, traced the starburst of pink scar tissue just below my right clavicle. \"What\u0027s that?\"\n \"Gunshot.\"\n \"I can see that.\" Three fingers now, tracing the skin. \"But it\u0027s new. How?\"\n \"An old friend. He gave it to me last spring.\"\n She exhaled a laugh against my shoulder. \"Figures.\"\n I kissed her and she didn\u0027t object. Then another kiss—longer, more earnest.\n I looked in her eyes—amber, bright, defying me to stop.\n \"I\u0027m pretty sure this is a reaction to trauma, here,\" I warned her.\n \"So react,\" she said.\n She shifted her weight onto me.\n I crossed my arms around her neck, pulled her face down to mine.\n Robert Johnson murred, protesting an obvious error in the direction of our affections. I nudged him with my foot, as gently as I could, to the edge of the bed, and then thump.\n After that I didn\u0027t care much what the cat did all night. And he extended us the same courtesy.\n CHAPTER 36\n I awoke in full daylight. The house was silent. The two notes I found pinned to my covers made me feel like a piece of transfer luggage.\n The first note said, Gone to chase Garrett. No regrets. Call you later. —M.\n The second note said, PS. Aren\u0027t you late for class?\n I looked at my watch, then practiced my Middle English expletives as I disentangled myself from the sheets, got dressed, and ran to my truck to make the fortyfiveminute drive to UT in half an hour.\n I walked in so late Father Time had already done one warmup story and was now starting the second. I thanked him, apologized to the class, then adlibbed a lecture on the Wakefield Crucifixion. We skimmed through the Croxton Play of the Sacrament—just enough to introduce the Jewish communionwafertrampling villains who would prefigure Barabbas in Marlowe\u0027s The Jew of Malta. We spent the rest of our time talking about antiSemitism. Your basic uplifting English lit session.\n By the time we adjourned, West Mall foot traffic was starting to pick up outside. The air smelled of clove cigarettes and the eggroll vending carts on Guadalupe. The cute Asian girl with the Henry James novel had staked out a bench in the shade by the entrance to the Student Union.\n Down at the crosswalk, Vic Lopez was talking to a street musician.\n Lopez was dressed in fatigue pants, combat boots, tight blue shirt. His face was pasty and grim, his sunglasses reflecting the sidewalk.\n The musician wore a poncho instead of a shirt, pants the colour of bread mould. He had one Birkenstock planted on a small amp, a harmonica holder and a Gibson acoustic strapped around his neck. Written in black across the face of the guitar was Australia or Bust.\n As I walked up, the musician was telling Lopez, \"Yeah. It\u0027s really nice down there this time of year.\"\n \"Barrier Reef?\" Lopez asked.\n \"Dude!\" To emphasize his excitement, the musician sucked a few notes out of his harmonica. \"I\u0027m telling you, this friend of mine—his first nightdive and shit, they told him to watch for green eyes. And he gets down there and this Great White glides past him not five feet away. Oh, man. A little more spare change, and I\u0027m there!\"\n I thought of green eyes underwater, tried not to shudder.\n Lopez patted the musician on the shoulder. Dust poofed from the poncho. \"You take it easy. Professor Navarre and I—we got to talk, now.\"\n The musician wagged all his fingers at me. \"Yeah, you\u0027re that new dude. Yeah. My friend said your class is fucking awesome.\"\n \"Fucking Awesome 301,\" I said. \"That\u0027s me.\"\n \"Teach it again next summer so I can audit, okay?\"\n \"You promise you will?\"\n \"Hey, man, right after Australia, I\u0027m there.\"\n Lopez grabbed my shoulder. \"Let\u0027s talk.\"\n We followed a herd of pigeons toward a table under a live oak.\n \"Nice fatigues,\" I told Lopez. \"Expecting a war?\"\n He leaned back in his chair, picked his sunglasses off, hung them from the collar of his Tshirt. \"In one already. I\u0027ve been put on paid leave.\"\n \"For finding Ruby?\"\n Seeing Lopez without his usual smile, I realized how big he was. I felt like I was back in high school varsity, looking across the scrimmage line at a fulltackle behemoth patiently waiting for the signal to pulverize me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-41.html","bookId":2419,"book":{"id":2419,"title":"The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4) \n Rick Riordan, triple-crown winner of the Edgar, Anthony, and Shamus Awards, brings his fast-talking, hard-living, Texas-hip P.I.
