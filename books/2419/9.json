{"id":76528,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"She met my eyes—daring me to speak first.\\n\\n \"Where did we leave off?\" I mused. \"That\u0027s right—you were just telling me how much you hated visiting Texas.\"\\n\\n \"Garrett called me, Tres—months ago, when Matthew Pena first approached them.\"\\n\\n \"You represented Pena twice—got him off the hook twice.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"And when Garrett asked my advice, I told him as much as I could without breaking attorneyclient privilege. I told him that under no circumstances, ever, should his company deal with Matthew Pena.\"\\n\\n \"That worked real well.\"\\n\\n Anger flickered in her eyes. \"Garrett kept me posted. When Jimmy Doebler— With what happened Thursday night, I felt responsible. I came down.\"\\n\\n \"From San Francisco.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Tres. Modern conveniences, like airplanes, make that possible.\"\\n\\n Her expression gave me nothing to feed on. It was calm, irritatingly professional.\\n\\n \"You could\u0027ve at least—\"\\n\\n \"What, Tres? Called? Garrett made it clear he did not want you involved. Frankly, I agreed with him.\"\\n\\n Garrett kept clacking on the keyboard, pretending to ignore us.\\n\\n Across the alley, on the secondstory deck of the frat house, a barechested Greek was drinking a beer. Perfect contentment—a lazy Sunday afternoon, one more party day before summer school started. I wondered if I could bean him from here with a rock.\\n\\n Instead I reached down, scooped up some of the papers around Garrett\u0027s seat.\\n\\n There was a list of the companies who were betatesting Techsan\u0027s security software.\\n\\n Co_op.com, Austin\u0027s online health food store. Ticket Time, the local event promoter.\\n\\n Four others I\u0027d never heard of—a West Texas petroleum company, two Internet financial service groups, a boating supply retailer—no doubt Ruby McBride\u0027s contri\\n\\n bution to their client list. There was a list of reported security leaks, about a dozen in all, most from the petroleum company and the two financial service groups, the companies with the biggest budgets and\\n\\n the most to lose. One letter from the CEO of the oil company formally cancelled the contract with Techsan and warned of a suit. The letter cited three different confidential inhouse reports that had been posted anonymously to a Usenet group—a leak that could cost the company millions. There were more letters like that—horror stories from the betatesters, irate emails, threats to sue Techsan out of existence. There was also one fax to Garrett, on Matthew Pena\u0027s letterhead, dated April 1, just before all hell broke loose. The fax read, Look forward to doing business with you. —M. An Austin number was written underneath.\\n\\n I stared at the M. for a long time.\\n\\n Garrett finally slammed the top of the keyboard shut. He took the joint out of his mouth, smushed it against the back of the monitor.\\n\\n Maia said, \"I guess that means no luck.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing else I can try from here. I need to get to the office.\"\\n\\n \"You go through a lot of laptops?\" I asked.\\n\\n Garrett glowered at me. \"Ruby insists on a meeting tonight. She\u0027s scared—wants to sell out. I\u0027ve got one afternoon to find something— some proof that we can isolate the problem.\"\\n\\n \"Can you trace the leaked documents?\" I asked. \"Figure out where they came from?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027ve thought of that, little bro? I\u0027d have to have permission from the betatest companies—get full access to their servers. The ones that were most affected are suing our asses. They aren\u0027t letting me anywhere near their machines.\"\\n\\n \"Can you get somebody to help you look? Ruby?\" \"No.\"\\n\\n \"The police?\"\\n\\n \"Hell no.\"\\n\\n I held up the fax from Matthew Pena. \"Any more love notes lying around?\"\\n\\n Garrett looked at the fax like he wanted to set it on fire. \"You\u0027re starting your class tomorrow. I hope that\u0027s the only reason you\u0027re here—you need a place to stay.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027ve already got company.\"\\n\\n Maia stared at me stonily.\\n\\n Garrett set aside his computer, brushed the ashes off the cover. \"She\u0027s staying at the Driskill, little bro. Don\u0027t be rude.\"\\n\\n \"Let me guess,\" I said. \"Matthew Pena\u0027s staying there, too.\"\\n\\n Maia raised her eyebrows. \"What makes you so sure?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll crowd him. Give him no room to breathe. Try to redirect the police investigation toward him. That\u0027s your plan, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"You assume a lot.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t come down here to defend Garrett. You\u0027re an offensive player.\\n\\n Something turned you against Pena. It\u0027s Pena you\u0027re after.\"\\n\\n Three seconds of silence. \"Tres, do us both a favour. Leave now.\"\\n\\n It was the first break in her coldness—when she said the word favour. It wasn\u0027t much, nothing I would\u0027ve caught had I not known her for a decade. Just the slightest indication that she wanted me gone for more reasons than one.\\n\\n I folded Pena\u0027s fax. \"I can\u0027t sit this out, Garrett.\"\\n\\n \"You and the goddamn ranch.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more than that.\"\\n\\n He stared past the balcony railing, like he was taking aim at something a long way off.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t reply.\\n\\n After a moment, Maia pointed at me, then pointed inside.\\n\\n Reluctantly, I followed.\\n\\n In the living room, Buffett was still singing his greatest hits. The parrot was bobbing his head, crooning the only words he knew—\"dickhead,\" \"noisy bastard,\" a few other cute obscenities.\\n\\n \"It would\u0027ve been more helpful if you were the pizza guy,\" Maia told me. \"I had nothing but peanuts on the plane, went straight from the airport to the homicide office.\"\\n\\n \"Pena,\" I said. \"Is he as bad as he looks on paper?\"\\n\\n She made a boat out of her money. \"Worse.\"\\n\\n There were pale Vs on the tops of her feet, remnants of a suntan through flipflops. I wondered if she still spent Saturday afternoons in the Mission, seeking out the only oasis of sunshine in San Francisco.\\n\\n \"I have to turn the investigation away from Garrett,\" she said. \"If the case goes to the DA the way it is . . .\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t finish. She didn\u0027t have to. We both understood why she couldn\u0027t wait for an indictment, why no defence lawyer would ever want to defend a friend in court. If the police felt confident enough to arrest Garrett, if the case went to trial without a plea bargain—the odds for acquittal got very long indeed.\\n\\n \"And you still don\u0027t want my help,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Garrett\u0027s call.\"\\n\\n \"Is it?\" I picked up Garrett\u0027s phone.\\n\\n Maia frowned. \"What are you—\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t really been expecting any luck—not on a Sunday afternoon—but on the third ring a cheery receptionist\u0027s voice said, \"Mr. Pena\u0027s offices. This is Krystal.\"\\n\\n I knew she spelled it with a K. She sounded like the K variety of Krystal.\\n\\n I told her I was the personal assistant to one of Matthew\u0027s venture capitalist friends. I knew it was lastminute, but my boss was going to be superpissed if I couldn\u0027t squeeze him in for an appointment with Matthew sometime today.\\n\\n Maia made an emphatic cut gesture across her throat.\\n\\n \"Oh, man,\" Krystal sympathized. \"This is such a bummer, but Mr. Pena is out the rest of the afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Out?\" I tried to sound devastated.\\n\\n \"Yeah. I\u0027m really sorry. He took some prospective clients to Windy Point.\"\\n\\n Maia was glaring at me.\\n\\n \"Windy Point,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t that on the lake somewhere?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Krystal agreed. \"The scuba place. Mr. Pena is big on that, you know? Likes to impress clients by taking them under, bonding with the fish. Ha, ha.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Ha, ha.\"\\n\\n \"So, like, he\u0027s out there teaching these guys to scuba dive. I\u0027m really sorry.\"\\n\\n I winked at Maia. \"That\u0027s okay, Krystal. In fact, that\u0027s just about perfect. Thanks.\"\\n\\n I hung up, told Maia where Matthew Pena was, what he was doing.\\n\\n Her reaction was just what I expected.\\n\\n She looked nauseated, swallowed deeply. \"I\u0027ll catch him tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Me, I think I\u0027ll go out to Windy Point. I\u0027ll try not to mess things up for you too bad.\"\\n\\n She glared at the floor, called me several unflattering names in Mandarin. I knew the names well enough. She\u0027d called me them before. \"You insist on wedging your way into this, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I gestured toward the door. \"After you?\" The pizza man was just coming up the stairs.\\n\\n Maia told him to go upstairs, give the pizza to the guy with no legs.\\n\\n She said she didn\u0027t anticipate being hungry again for a very long time.\\n\\n CHAPTER 9\\n\\n The man in the wet suit had just finished getting sick.\\n\\n He was hunched over on a picnic bench, elbows on his knees, the purged contents of his stomach speckling the grass between his feet. His face glistened with sweat and lake water, the sclera of his eyes an unhealthy shade of egg yolk yellow.\\n\\n As Maia and I walked toward him, his expression turned from misery to embarrassment. The message was clear: Please let me suffer in privacy.\\n\\n \"You okay?\" I asked.\\n\\n He had pinched features, a Mediterranean tan. He was probably in his late twenties, though he looked older from the sun lines scoring his eyes and mouth. Handsome, in a small, tight way. His hair was a closecropped skullcap of chocolate brown, water trickling off behind his ears. He had eyes like an old lady\u0027s poodle—big and dark, filled with mournful selfconsciousness, anxiety over the fact that he wasn\u0027t a bulldog.\\n\\n \"Guess I need a little more practice,\" he said.\\n\\n We were at the last picnic table on Windy Point, next to the metal stairs that led down a twentyfoot limestone cliff to the water. Dragonflies zagged in drunken orbits over the grass. A strong, steady breeze blew off the headlands—the kind of wind that would hide a sunburn on a day like this, not let you know you\u0027d become fried and dehydrated until it was too late.\\n\\n Behind us, in the woods, several dozen scuba campers had set up their tents, equipment trailers, barbecue pits. I could smell hamburgers cooking. Red and white dive flags decorated everything. Swimsuits and dive skins were draped over lawn chairs. The black rubbery hoses of regulators hung in live oak branches like trophy kill octopi.\\n\\n The little gravel road ended at our feet. There was nothing farther but the dropoff and the lake.\\n\\n Maia Lee didn\u0027t look much better than the scuba diver. She\u0027d looked progressively worse the closer we\u0027d gotten to the lake. Apparently, though, she remembered scuba training better than I did. She noticed the sick man\u0027s air tank standing upright on the table— a big nono in the world of diving. She picked up the tank and laid it on the ground sideways, where it couldn\u0027t fall over and cause mischief.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" the man murmured. \"Forgot.\"\\n\\n And then he took another look at her, squinting to make out her face in the sun. \"Don\u0027t I— Miss Lee?\"\\n\\n \"Hello, Dwight.\"\\n\\n If it was possible for Dwight to look any more nauseated, he did. \"Oh my God. Matthew called you out here?\"\\n\\n I placed the name. Dwight Hayes—the AccuShield employee who had supported Matthew Pena\u0027s statement about his girlfriend falling off the dinner yacht.\\n\\n \"Dwight,\" Maia said, \"this is a friend of mine, Tres Navarre.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-9.html","bookId":2419,"book":{"id":2419,"title":"The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4)","description":"Storyline: The Devil Went Down to Austin (Tres Navarre #4) \\n Rick Riordan, triple-crown winner of the Edgar, Anthony, and Shamus Awards, brings his fast-talking, hard-living, Texas-hip P.I.
