{"id":69722,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"To Betty Shapian, whose kindness and helpfulness have been unfailing I Just Make Them Up, See! I Just Make Them Up, See! Oh, Dr. A.- Oh, Dr. A.- There is something (don\u0027t go \u0027way) That I\u0027d like to hear you say. Though I\u0027d rather die Than try To pry, The fact, you\u0027ll find, Is that my mind Has evolved the jackpot question for today. I intend no cheap derision, So please answer with decision, And, discarding all your petty cautious fears, Tell the secret of your vision! How on earth Do you give birth To those crazy and impossible ideas? Is it indigestion And a question Of the nightmare that results? Of your eyeballs whirling, Twirling, Fingers curling And unfurling, While your blood beats maddened chimes As it keeps impassioned times With your thick, uneven pulse? Is it that, you think, or liquor That brings on the wildness quicker? For a teeny Weeny Dry martini May be just your private genie; Or perhaps those Tom and Jerries You will find the very Berries For inducing And unloosing That weird gimmick or that kicker; Or an awful Combination Of unlawful Stimulation, Marijuana plus tequila, That will give you just that feel o\u0027 Things a-clicking And unsticking As you start your cerebration To the crazy syncopation Of a brain a-tocking-ticking. Surely something, Dr. A., Makes you fey And quite outr��. Since I read you with devotion, Won\u0027t you give me just a notion Of that shrewdly pepped-up potion Out of which emerge your plots? That wild secret bubbly mixture That has made you such a fixture In most favored s. f. spots- Now, Dr. A., Don\u0027t go away- Oh, Dr. A.- Oh, Dr. A- Rejection Slips a - Learned Dear Asimov, all mental laws Prove orthodoxy has its flaws. Consider that eclectic clause In Kant\u0027s philosophy that gnaws With ceaseless anti-logic jaws At all outworn and useless saws That stick in modern mutant craws. So here\u0027s your tale (with faint applause). The words above show ample cause. b - Gruff Dear Ike, I was prepared (And, boy, I really cared) To swallow almost anything you wrote. But, Ike, you\u0027re just plain shot, Your writing\u0027s gone to pot, There\u0027s nothing left but hack and mental bloat. Take back this piece of junk; It smelled; it reeked; it stunk; Just glancing through it once was deadly rough. But Ike, boy, by and by, Just try another try. I need some yarns and, kid, I love your stuff. c - Kindly Dear Isaac, friend of mine, I thought your tale was fine. Just frightful- Ly delightful And with merits all a-shine. It meant a quite full Night, full, Friend, of tension Then relief And attended With full measure Of the pleasure Of suspended Disbelief. It is triteful, Scarcely rightful, Almost spiteful To declare That some tiny faults are there. Nothing much, Perhaps a touch, And over such You shouldn\u0027t pine. So let me say Without delay, My pal, my friend, Your story\u0027s end Has left me gay And joyfully composed. P. S. Oh, yes, I must confess (With some distress) Your story is regretfully enclosed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nine-tomorrows/page-1.html","bookId":1736,"book":{"id":1736,"title":"Nine Tomorrows","description":"Storyline: Contents: · I Just Make Them Up, See! · Rejection Slips · Profession · The Feeling of Power · The Dying Night · I’m in Marsport Without Hilda · The Gentle Vultures · All the Troubles of the World · Spell My Name with an S · The Last Question · The Ugly Little Boy [“Lastborn”]","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/nine-tomorrows.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/nine-tomorrows.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:07 AM"}}
