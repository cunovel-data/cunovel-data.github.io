They want nothing more than to sail into the tropical sunset and leave their troubles behind for one blissful week. But where Emily, Aria, Spencer, and Hanna go, A goes, too. From scuba diving to tanning on the upper deck, A is there, soaking up all their new secrets. \n Emily is smooching a stowaway. Aria\u0027s treasure-hunting partner is a little too interested in her booty. Spencer\u0027s going overboard trying to land a new boy. And a blast--or rather, a crash--from Hanna\u0027s past could mean rough waters ahead for everyone. \n The liars better tighten their life jackets. A perfect storm is brewing, and if they aren\u0027t careful, A will bury them at sea. . . .\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/burned-pretty-little-liars-12.jpg","author":"Sara Shepard","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":37,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
