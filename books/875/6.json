{"id":27793,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. AT NEW ORLEANS.","content":"F RANK NORRIS took his way eastward after leaving Westminster. He slept at a small hotel in the city, and at daybreak walked on to the docks. He was careless where he went, so that it was out of England; but he was determined, if possible, to work his passage, so as to leave the sum of money in his pocket untouched until he got to his destination. He went on board a number of ships and asked the captains if they wanted hands, but on his acknowledgment that he had never been at sea, none of them would ship him for the outward voyage only. At last he paused before a fine ship, the Mississippi; a printed placard on the wharf beside her mentioned that the well-known and favourite clipper would sail for New Orleans on that day. He walked on board and went up to the captain, who was talking to the first mate, while the latter was superintending the getting of cargo on board. \"Do you want a hand, sir?\" \"Well, that depends,\" the captain said; \"I am still two or three hands short, but they have promised to send me them this morning. Are you a sailor?\" \"No, sir; but I can row and sail an open boat, and am[93] ready to make myself useful. I want to work my passage out.\" \"You look an active young fellow,\" the captain said, \"but I don\u0027t care about taking a landsman only for the voyage out; I should have to ship another hand in your place at New Orleans, and probably have to pay more wages there than I could get one for here. Still, likely enough, they may send me down at the last moment two or three hands who know no more about it than you do, and may not be half so willing to learn as I should judge you to be. What do you say, Ephraim; shall we take him?\" \"He looks a likely sort,\" the mate said. \"Very well then, it\u0027s agreed; you can take off your coat and fall to work at once; I will send down word to the office that I have shipped you.\" Frank stripped off his coat and waistcoat, and stowed them, with his portmanteau, out of the way, and then set to work with a will, the whiteness of his shirt, and his general appearance, exciting some jeering comments among the other men at work; but the activity and strength which he showed soon astonished and silenced them. By one o\u0027clock the last bale of cargo was stowed, and the hatches put on. The landsmen who had been employed went on shore, and Frank went forward to the forecastle, with the men, to dinner. \"Not the sort of grub you have been accustomed to, lad,\" one of the men said. \"I have eaten worse,\" Frank said carelessly, \"and don\u0027t care if I never eat better. How long do you suppose we shall be before we get to New Orleans?\" \"It all depends upon the wind,\" the sailor answered,[94] \"may be a month, may be three. Are you going to leave us there?\" \"Yes,\" Frank said, \"I am only working my passage out.\" \"It\u0027s a roughish place is New Orleans,\" the sailor said; \"the sort of place where you want to have a knife or pistol ready at hand. Lor\u0027, I have seen some rum doings there; it\u0027s a word and a blow, I can tell ye.\" \"Ah! well,\" Frank laughed, \"I suppose I shall do as well as the rest.\" The voice of the mate was now heard calling to all hands to prepare to cast off. The men had hurried through their dinner, for they knew that the time allowed them would be short, and began casting off hawsers, coiling down ropes, and preparing for a start. The bell was ringing, and the friends of the passengers were saying good-bye. The capstan was manned, and the vessel moved slowly away from the quay. Five minutes later she was at the dock gates; these swung open, and the vessel slowly made her way through them, and was soon in the river. As the men ran aloft to loosen the sails, Frank placed himself next to the sailor who had spoken to him at dinner, and followed him up the shrouds, and, imitating his actions, he was soon out on the yard hauling away with the others. When the sails were all set he returned below. \"Wall done, youngster,\" the mate said; \"I reckon you are about as spry for a green hand as any I have come across; I had my eye on you, and you\u0027ll do. You go on like that, and you will make a first-rate hand afore long.\" There was plenty of work to do as they went down[95] the river. The sails had to be braced round as the wind took them on different sides in the winding reaches; the decks were sluiced down, to get rid of the first coat of dirt which they had acquired in the docks; ropes had to be coiled and tidied up, and the many articles lying loosely about the deck to be put in their places and lashed in readiness for sea work. The tide met them just as it was getting dark, and as the wind dropped, and was not sufficiently strong to carry the ship against it, the anchor was dropped a few miles below Gravesend. The men were divided into two watches, but all were told that, with the exception of two stationed as an anchor watch, they could turn in till tide turned. Frank threw himself at once into the bunk which had been allotted to him. He had not closed an eye the night before, and was worn out by emotion and fatigue, and scarcely had he lain down than he was sound asleep. He had been placed in the starboard watch, and slept till he was roughly shaken at four o\u0027clock in the morning. \"Get up, mate, your watch is called.\" Frank leapt out and made his way on deck. The vessel had been now three hours under weigh. She had passed the Nore, whose light shone brightly over the stern. \"The wind is freshening a bit,\" one of the men said, \"we shall be out round the Foreland by dinner-time.\" The voyage was an uneventful one; Frank escaped the first fight in which new-comers generally have to take part before they settle down in their new sphere. He was thoroughly good-tempered, and fully a match for any of his messmates in chaff, and he soon became a favourite in the fo\u0027castle. He was always ready to take his share of the work, and was soon as much at home on the yards[96] as the rest. The change and the newness of the life were very good for him; he was never alone, and had no time to think or brood over his troubles, and he was almost sorry when the end of the voyage approached. \"Not a lively-looking shore,\" the mate said to him as he leaned against the bulwark, looking at the low banks of the river a few miles below New Orleans. \"No, even an American may confess that there ain\u0027t much beauty about this river. It\u0027s a great river, and a mighty useful one, but it ain\u0027t beautiful. Now, what are you thinking of doing when you get ashore?\" \"I was thinking to begin by getting employment on board a boat of some sort. What I shall do afterwards of course I do not know; but if I can earn my living on the water for a few months, till I have time to look round and see what is best to be done, I shall be well satisfied. I have got a few pounds, but I don\u0027t want to touch them; they will come in useful if I want to move, or to buy a horse, or anything of that sort.\" \"You will do,\" the mate said. \"You have shown yourself a right-down sharp fellow on board this ship, and I expect you will make your way whatever you try a hand at. I have taken a fancy to you, and should be glad to do you a good turn if I can. I have been in and out of this port for some years, and know Orleans pretty tidy, and I can tell you that there ain\u0027t a port on this side of the water or the other where a fellow can be put out of the way more promptly than here; there are parts of New Orleans which, I tell you, are a sort of hell on earth. \"There are places you couldn\u0027t go into without some one picking a quarrel with you afore you have been in there two minutes, and a quarrel here means knives out[97] afore you have time to think. On the other hand, Orleans is a place where a steady industrious fellow, with his head screwed on right, has a good chance of getting on. The trade up the river is immense, and will be far greater than it is now; and there\u0027s pretty well a continent to the west, with openings of all sorts, land and cattle, houses and mining, and trade with Mexico. But I don\u0027t see as you can do better than to follow out your own idea. \"I know a score of men here who own boats trading up the river, and the first time I go ashore I will take you with me and put you in good hands. The rate of pay ain\u0027t high, for it\u0027s looked on as easy work; still, a few months at it will open your eyes and put you into the ways of the country, and, once at home, I tell you there\u0027s money to be made on the river, heaps of it, and when it\u0027s seen that you are steady, and willing, and \u0027cute, you will find plenty who will give you a helping hand. There\u0027s no greater place for loafers than New Orleans, and a chap who will really work will soon make his mark.\" Frank warmly thanked the mate for his offer. The moment the ship cast anchor off the town a crowd of negroes came on board and unloaded her, and the crew had comparatively little to do; the three or four passengers who had come out in her went on shore at once, but it was not until the third afternoon after her arrival that the mate was able to leave the ship. \"Now, lad,\" he said to Frank, \"jump into the boat along with me, and I will see if I can\u0027t put you into the groove.\" Keeping along the wharves for some distance, the mate presently entered a small wooden office, telling Frank to wait outside.[98] On entering he accosted the only occupant of the place, a man of some forty years of age, who was dressed entirely in white, and was sitting smoking a huge cigar, with his chair tilted back and his feet on the table. \"How are you, Ephraim?\" he said, as the mate entered. \"I saw your ship had arrived. Had a good voyage?\" \"First-class,\" the mate replied; \"not very fast, but quiet and comfortable,\" and he took a cigar from an open box on the table and lighted it. \"I haven\u0027t come round for a talk with you now, I have only just come ashore for the first time; but I wanted to speak to you about a young chap as came out with us. He has worked his passage out, and is about the smartest young fellow I ever shipped, and has the makings of a first-class seaman in him, but he doesn\u0027t care about stopping at sea. He\u0027s of good family in the old country, as one can easily see. I expect he has got into some scrape, and has had to make a bolt of it; however, that\u0027s no business of mine. He\u0027s as strong as a horse, and as active as a squirrel; he can handle an oar and sail a boat. I didn\u0027t like the thought of his landing here and getting into bad hands, so I thought I would come straight to you. He said what he wanted to do was to work on the river, for a few months at any rate, until he got to know the place. Now I know you have a dozen tugs and a score of barges, and I thought you might set him on at once. He would make a good second hand on one of your large boats. If it\u0027s but to oblige me, I wish you would put him on board one with a sober, steady chap of a decent kind; as soon as he gets to know the work and the river, I will guarantee that he will be fit to take charge himself.\" \"That\u0027s easy enough done, Ephraim,\" the trader replied, \"all except finding the sober and steady decent man to[99] put him under. However, I will do my best. Have you got him here?\" \"Yes, he is outside,\" Ephraim said; and rising, he went to the door and called Frank in. \"This is the hand I was speaking to you about, Mr. Willcox.\" \"Well, young man,\" the trader said, \"I hear you want a berth on board a tug or flat. Which would you rather have?\" \"I would prefer to be on a flat,—at any rate for a time, sir,\" Frank said; \"I am a pretty good hand at sailing or rowing, but I don\u0027t know anything about steamboats.\" \"There\u0027s not much to learn in that,\" the trader said; \"the work is simply to keep the decks clean, to help to load and unload at each landing-place, and to pole off in shallows. However, I will put you on board a flat. The wages to begin with will be twenty dollars a month and your keep, if that will suit you.\" \"That will do, sir, very well,\" Frank said. \"When shall I come to work?\" \"If you come here this time to-morrow you can go aboard at once. One of the flats will go up the first thing in the morning.\" \"Thank you, sir, I will be here. I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Alderson, for your kind recommendation of me.\" \"I am glad to have put you into a berth,\" the mate said. \"Now I should recommend you to get on board again soon.\" Frank strolled about the wharves for an hour or two, and then went on board. Before going on shore the following day, the captain gave him a certificate, saying that he had sailed in the Mississippi, and was a good, willing, and reliable hand.[100] \"You may not intend to go to sea again, but if you should, this will get you a better berth than if you had applied as a landsman. I am very pleased with your conduct on board the ship, and I am only sorry you are leaving us. I think it\u0027s a pity you don\u0027t stick to it, for it is clear that you are well educated, and would be able to pass as a mate as soon as you had been the requisite time at sea. However, you can fall back on that if you don\u0027t get on as well as you expect on shore.\" The mate said good-bye to him warmly. \"Your employer is one of the very best in the place,\" said he. \"You must not suppose he is in a small way because you see him in that little office: he is one of the largest tug and flat owners in New Orleans. He keeps his eye on his men, and will push you forward if he sees you deserve it. He has the name of having the best of captains on the river, and of being one of the best and most liberal of employers. But you must not expect much in flat life, you will find the men rough as well as the work.\" \"I shan\u0027t mind that,\" Frank said cheerfully; \"our own bargemen on the Thames are not the most polished of men.\" \"And, lad,\" the mate added, \"I should advise you to hand over any money you may have with you to Mr. Willcox; the less money you have in your pockets the better. You have no occasion for it on the river, and there are loafers hanging about at every landing who would think nothing of knocking a man on the head if they thought he had got fifty dollars in his pocket.\" Frank promised to take his advice, and, with a hearty farewell to the mate, and a cordial one to his late shipmates,[101] he put his portmanteau in the boat and was rowed ashore. FRANK\u0027S VISIT TO MR. HIRAM LITTLE\u0027S OFFICE. FRANK\u0027S VISIT TO MR. HIRAM LITTLE\u0027S OFFICE. \"Oh, here you are,\" Mr. Willcox said, as he entered; \"just give a call to that man you see outside.\" Before doing so, Frank handed over his twenty sovereigns to the trader, asking him to keep them for him, and then went to the door. On a log close by a tall, gaunt man was sitting smoking a short pipe. Frank asked him to step in. \"Hiram,\" the trader said, \"this is the young Britisher who is going as your second hand. I have good accounts of him as a sailor, so you won\u0027t have to teach him that part of the business. Of course he is new to the river and its ways.\" \"I will put him through,\" the man said, \"and will teach him as much as I knows myself if he cares to learn.\" \"There is no one knows the river better, Hiram; and, as you know, I would have given you the command of a steamer long ago if you would have taken it.\" \"No, sir,\" the man said emphatically, \"not for Hiram Little. I have been on board a flat all my days, and am not going to be hurried along in one of them puffing things. They have their uses, I am ready enough to allow, when the current is swift and the wind light; I am glad enough of a cast now and then, but to be always in a bustle and flurry is more than I could stand. Come along, youngster, with your sack; the boat is a quarter of a mile down.\" Taking up his portmanteau, Frank followed his conductor, who with long strides led the way along the wharf. Not a word was spoken till they reached the side of the boat. This was not a flat such as now are in[102] general use, but a large boat some forty feet in length by fourteen wide, almost flat-bottomed, and capable of carrying a cargo of eight or ten tons of goods. In the stern was a little cabin some eight feet long for the captain and his mate. In front was a similar structure for the four negroes who formed the crew. She carried one mast, with a large lug-sail. She had four sweeps, but these were seldom used. When the wind was fair she ran before it, when it was foul the mast was lowered; if it fell calm when they were coming down the stream they drifted with it, if when going up, they either anchored or poled her along in the back waters close inshore, or made their way up the numerous channels where the stream flowed sluggishly, or tied on behind a tug if one happened to come along. Their principal work was to carry up supplies to the various plantations along the banks, to trade with the villages, and to bring down produce to New Orleans; for the stopping-places of the steamers were at wide distances apart, and the number of steamers themselves very small in comparison with those now afloat on the great river. At times they made longer journeys, going up as far as St. Louis; but in that case they were generally, as Frank afterwards learned, towed up the whole distance. \"Hi! Pete, shove that plank ashore,\" Hiram shouted, and a negro at once showed his head above a scuttle in the bow of the boat, and then emerging, pushed a plank across the fifteen feet of water which intervened between the flat and the wharf. \"That\u0027s your first lesson, young man,\" Hiram said. \"Never on no account lay your craft close alongside; thar\u0027s river thieves at these landings as would empty[103] half the cargo if you left the boat for ten minutes, if they could step aboard, and these niggers are always asleep the minute after you take your eyes off them. So, whether you have got anything aboard or not, stick to the rule and moor her a bit off the wharf. It\u0027s only the trouble of dropping the grapnel over on the outside in addition to the hawser ashore, and then there\u0027s never no trouble when you get back and have to report as how you have lost some of the bales. It ain\u0027t as how we carry up many things as would pay for taking; soft goods for the stores up the river mostly goes by steamer, but them as ain\u0027t hurried, and likes to keep their dollars in their pockets, has their goods up by flats. I have got ten hogsheads of sugar, twenty-four crates of hardware, some barrels of molasses, and forty casks of spirits on board, eighty kegs of nails and a ton or two of rice and flour. We reckon to go up light, and I don\u0027t care to have the flat more nor half-full, for when the river\u0027s low and the wind light the less we have on board the better. Now Pete, let\u0027s have tea as soon as may be.\" By this time they had entered the cabin at the stern of the boat. It was only about five feet high, but was large and roomy, and Frank saw with pleasure that it was neat and clean, and was an abode infinitely preferable to the forecastle of the Mississippi. \"Now, lad, that\u0027s your side, and this is mine; that\u0027s your bunk. I am given to tidy ways, having all my life lived in small places, and I hope as you will fall into my ways; I keeps the cabin tidy myself, and Pete never comes aft here except to bring the food and take it away again; I can\u0027t a-bear niggers messing about a place. Victuals of all sorts is provided. You can do as you like[104] about liquor. I keeps a keg of rum on board, and I likes my glass at night; if you likes to join me at that you can pay for half the keg, it has not been broached yet. If you want to drink more nor two glasses a night, ye had best get in yer own stock; if ye don\u0027t want to touch it at all, just leave it.\" Frank said he liked a glass of grog at night, and should be glad to join in the cask, and that he would do his best to keep his side of the cabin as tidy as the other. In a few minutes the negro brought in the meal, which consisted of a steak fried with onions, followed by a large bowl of oatmeal, with a jug of molasses, and the whole was washed down with tea. \"The stream does not seem to run very rapidly,\" Frank said, as he and his companion, having lit their pipes, sat down on the deck above. \"It varies,\" Hiram replied; \"sometimes it\u0027s sluggish, as you see it here, sometimes it runs like a mill-stream. The art of sailing here is to know the river; for what with its back currents and its eddies, its channels behind islands and its sandbanks, one who knows it can manage to make his way up, while one who didn\u0027t know would be drifting backward instead of getting forward. That\u0027s what you have got to learn. Fortunately the wind generally blows up the stream; when it don\u0027t it\u0027s a case of down anchor. There are places where one can hardly get along unless the wind happens to be unusually strong, and there I generally get a tow. The boss has got about twenty steamers on the river, so we don\u0027t generally have to wait many hours before one comes along. The tugs is gradually doing away with sailing boats, and in time there won\u0027t be many of our kind of craft left; but they are[105] useful, you see, for small places where the steamers don\u0027t stop, and for the rivers which run into the Mississippi.\" The next morning at daybreak the sail was hoisted, the hawsers thrown off from the shore, and the flat made her way up the river. Frank was surprised to see how fast she sailed, although the wind was but light. The work was easy, for the wind was steady and they seldom sailed at night, the wind generally dropping at sundown. They touched at numerous little settlements, and gradually got rid of the cargo with which they had started. Sometimes they left the main river and sailed for many miles by narrow channels, where the current, for the most part, was almost imperceptible. They were more than a month from the time they started before they reached the spot at which they were to take in the cargo for their return voyage. The flat was then loaded up with grain, which was put in in bulk and covered with tarpaulin; the boat was now laden down nearly to the water\u0027s edge. The downward voyage differed widely from that up the river; the sail was now seldom used, and instead of skirting the shores they kept in mid-channel, from time to time directing the boat\u0027s course by the use of the sweeps. The moon was nearly full when they started, and they continued their voyage by night as well as day. Hiram and Frank took it by turns to be on watch; but the former was seldom down below, except on the rare occasions when the river was free from shoals. Frank had by this time learned by the ripples on the water to detect the shallows, and could direct the course without assistance; but as soon as the splash of oars was[106] heard on the water, Hiram was sure to appear on deck, however short the time since he had retired to rest. \"You are seeing the river at its best,\" he was saying one day. \"It is about half-full now; when the water\u0027s low, the channel where we can pass loaded is often only fifty yards wide, with the water running through it like a sluice. When the water is in flood there is no fear of shoals, but you have got to look about, for it is full of floating trees and logs; when these get stuck we call them snags, and if you were to run on one of them the chances are it would knock a hole as big as a cask in her bottom, and down you would go in two or three minutes.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86707.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
