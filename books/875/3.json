{"id":27790,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. A CRIPPLE BOY.","content":"J OHN HOLL returned from work a few minutes after Evan came in. John Holl was a dustman. A short, broadly-built man, with his shoulders bowed somewhat from carrying heavy baskets up area steps. His looks were homely, and his attire far from clean; but John was a good husband and father, and the great proportion of the many twopences he daily received as douceurs for discharging his duties were brought home to his wife, as was all the weekly money, instead of being exchanged for liquor at the public-house. Sarah Holl added to the family income by going out charring. She was a big woman, with a rough voice, and slipshod in walk; her hands were red and hard from much scrubbing and polishing, and she was considered generally by the servants in the establishments at which she worked to be a low person. But Sarah\u0027s heart was in the right place; her children loved her, and her husband regarded her as a treasure. It was not until John Holl had changed his dirt-stained clothes, and had freshened himself up with a copious wash, had put on a pair of list slippers of Sarah\u0027s[43] manufacture in place of his heavy boots, and had seated himself by the fire with his long pipe alight, while Sarah bustled about getting the tea, that he was informed of the important events which had taken place; for John, like many more distinguished men, had his idiosyncrasies, and one of these was that he hated to be, as he called it, \"hustled,\" before he had tidied up. John was not quick of comprehension, and could not give due weight to what was said to him while engaged in the important work of changing; therefore all pieces of family news were reserved until he had taken his seat and his pipe was fully alight. Then Mrs. Holl began— \"What do you think, John, Evan \u0027as been a-doing to-day?\" John gave a grunt, to signify that he would prefer hearing the facts to wasting his brain-power in random guesses. \"Why, he has been in the Serpentine, and was nigh drowned, and had to be taken to the \u0027Mane Society and put into a hot bath, and all his clothes shrunk that much as you never seed.\" \"I thought the ice weren\u0027t strong enough to bear,\" John said, taking his pipe from his mouth; \"one of my mates tells me as he heard a chap going along with skates say as it weren\u0027t strong enough on the Serpentine to hold a cat.\" \"No more it ain\u0027t, John; but Carrie Hill\u0027s little dog run on and fell through, and nothing would do but that Evan must go out and risk his life to fetch it out. And a nice business he made of it; when he got close out to the dog down he went hisself, and would have been drowned as sure as fate if a young gent as was a-standing there hadn\u0027t swam out and brought him in. And I think you[44] ought to speak to him, John, for such venturesome ways; he don\u0027t mind my speaking no more than the wind a-blowing.\" John Holl smoked his pipe in silence for some time, looking solemnly into the fire; the number of facts and ideas presented suddenly to him were too great to be instantly taken in and grappled with. \"And how do you feel now, Evan?\" he said at last; \"cold right through the bones?\" \"No, father; I am as warm as need be; and what do you think? I have got thirty-eight bob and some coppers which they \u0027scribed for me.\" \"Did they, now?\" John Holl said. Then after taking in this new fact, and turning it over in different lights, he said to his wife, \"Well, Sarah, it seems to me that if the people who saw our Evan go into the water subscribed well-nigh upon two pounds for the boy, they must have thought that what he did warn\u0027t a thing for him to be jawed for, but a brave, good-hearted sort of action; and I ain\u0027t no manner of doubt, Sarah, that that\u0027s just what you think it yerself, only you are a bit scared over the thought that he might have been drowned, which is natural and woman-like. It seems to me as Evan has done a wery honourable kind o\u0027 action. I know as I should have liked to have done it myself, though I holds that a man can\u0027t have too much of hot water and plenty of soap in it, cold water allus giving me the shivers, and being no good for getting out dirt—not where its ground in pretty thick. I suppose it\u0027s cos of this that I didn\u0027t larn to swim. Evan, my boy, your father feels proud of yer, and so does your mother—as proud as a peacock—though she don\u0027t think it\u0027s right to say so.\"[45] Whereupon Mrs. Holl, finding to her great inward satisfaction that the paternal sanction and approval had been given to Evan\u0027s adventure, felt no longer constrained to keep up a semblance of disapproval, but embraced him with great heartiness, and then wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron. Then came the great point of the disposal of Evan\u0027s fortune. His first proposal was to hand it over to his father as a contribution towards the general expenses, but this John Holl peremptorily refused. \"It\u0027s your money, boy, to do as you like with; it\u0027s earned in a honourable way, and a way to be proud of. You are to do with it just what you likes; it were best not to spend it foolish, but if you are disposed to spend it foolish, you do so.\" \"There are such lots of things I should like to buy,\" Evan said. \"I should like to buy mother a new Sunday bonnet, and I should like to get you a pound of bacca; and Winnie wants a new pair of boots and stockings, and there\u0027s lots of things I should like to get for Harry, and some warm gloves for Sue, and—and no end of things.\" \"Two pounds,\" John Holl said, \"is a nice little lump of money, Evan; but when you gets as old as I am you will know as two pounds don\u0027t go wery far. My advice to you is this, whatever you get yer sure a while afterwards to want something else, and to wish as you had bought that instead; that\u0027s human nature, and it\u0027s the same with men, women, and boys—at least that\u0027s my \u0027sperience, and mother will tell you the same. My advice is, give that money to mother to keep for you, say for a month. Well then, every day you can settle fresh what you mean to buy, and that will be most as good as buying it; perhaps towards the end of the month you will have settled yer[46] mind on to something which really seems to you better than all the others: that\u0027s my advice.\" \"And capital good advice too, father,\" Harry said. And thus the approval of the two authorities of the family having been obtained, the matter was considered as settled. \"And who was the young gent as went in and fetched you out, Evan?\" John Holl asked, when the important business of tea was concluded, and he again settled himself to his pipe. \"He must have been a good sort; I should like to shake hands with that chap.\" \"He told me as his name were Frank Norris,\" Evan replied; \"he is one of the scholars we see going along to Vincent Square; I knew him again directly. He was one of those chaps as fought so well the day they got attacked going back to the School. A fine-looking chap he is too, with a pleasant face, and a nice sort of way about him. No nonsense, you know; he talked just pleasant and nice, as Harry might talk to me, just as if he was a sort of pal, and not a swell no-how.\" \"I should like to shake hands with him,\" John Holl repeated; \"he saved your life, that\u0027s sure enough\"—for by this time Harry had related the full details of the affair. \"I think, Sarah, as it would be only right and proper, come Sunday, for you and I to go round to that young fellow\u0027s house and tell him how we feels about it. If it had been a chap of our own station in life I suppose there ain\u0027t nothing we wouldn\u0027t do for him, if we saw our way to it; and though I don\u0027t see as it\u0027s likely as we can do nothing for this young fellow, the least as we can do is to go and tell him what we thinks about it. Did he tell you where he lived, Evan?\"[47] \"No, father. He didn\u0027t say where he lived; but he writ down in a pocket-book my name and where we lived, and said as how he would look in one of these days and see that I was none the worse for my ducking.\" \"Well, I hopes as how he will,\" John said, \"but if he don\u0027t come soon, we must find him out. I expect his name or his father\u0027s name would be down in a \u0027Rectory, and the name ain\u0027t so common a one as there would be likely to be a great many on them living about here; but if there was fifty I would call on them all till I found the right one. I shan\u0027t be easy in my mind, not till I have shaken that young chap\u0027s hand and told him what I thinks on it. And I am sure your mother feels the same as I do. And now, Harry, take out that fiddle of yours and let\u0027s have a tune; my pipe allus seems to draw better and sweeter while you are playing.\" One of the children—there were eight in all in the room—fetched Harry\u0027s fiddle from the wall. It was a cheap, common instrument, but even far better judges of music than the Holls would have been able to discern, in spite of its cracked and harsh tone, that the lad who was playing it had a genius for music. It is true that the airs which he was playing, those which the street boys of the day whistled as they walked by, were not of a nature to display his powers. Harry could play other and very different kinds of music; for whenever Evan earned a sixpence by holding a horse, or doing any other odd job, a penny or twopence were sure to go in the purchase of a sheet of music for Harry at the cheap bookstalls. Harry had learned the notes from a secondhand book of instructions which John Holl had bought for him one Saturday night, when the weather had been particularly hot, and[48] people in their desire to get their dust-bins emptied were more liberal than usual. But of an evening, when John was at home, Harry always played popular airs, as his father and family were unable to appreciate the deeper and better music. This he reserved for the time when the children were at school, and mother was either charring or was at the wash-tub. Sarah used to wonder silently at the sounds which seemed to her to have no particular air, such as she could beat time to with her foot as she worked; but in her heart she appreciated them; they made her feel as if she was in church, and sometimes she would draw her apron across her eyes, wondering all the time what there was in the tones of the fiddle which should make her cry. Three or four days later, when Harry, as usual, was playing on his violin, and Mrs. Holl was washing, there was a knock at the door. \"Drat it!\" Mrs. Holl muttered, \"who\u0027s a-coming bothering now, just when I am busy?\" \"If no one is to come except when you are not busy,\" Harry laughed, as Mrs. Holl moved towards the door, wiping the lather from her arms and hands, \"we shan\u0027t have many visitors, for as far as I can see you are always busy. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, as Mrs. Holl opened the door, and he saw who was standing without, \"it\u0027s the gentleman who got Evan out of the water.\" \"Mrs. Holl?\" Frank asked interrogatively, and then, catching sight of Harry, he at once walked across to him and shook him by the hand. \"I hope I am not intruding, Mrs. Holl, but I promised your son to look in and see how he was; and as I had to[49] come down to the School to-day for a book I wanted for my holiday task, I thought it would be a good opportunity to fulfil my promise.\" \"It is no intrusion, sir, and I am sure I am heartily glad to see yer, and thank ye for coming,\" Mrs. Holl said, as she dusted an already spotless chair and placed it for her visitor. \"My John does nothing every evening but talk of how he wishes he could see you, to tell you how beholden he and me feels to you for having brought our Evan to land just as he was being drowned.\" \"No thanks are required indeed, Mrs. Holl,\" Frank said cheerfully, \"it was a sort of partnership affair. You see I was going in after the dog, only Evan, who was a sort of friend of the family, had first claim; so we agreed that he should try first and do all the hard work of breaking the ice, and then, if the cold was too much for him, I was to go out and fetch him in and finish the job myself. So you see it was a mutual arrangement, and no particular thanks due to any one. But your son is a plucky young fellow, Mrs. Holl, and he behaved most gallantly. I find too, from what your son here tells me, that I owe him one for having fetched help up from the School when we were getting the worst of it just opposite your house here. Well, in the first place, how is he? None the worse, I hope, for the cold.\" \"Not at all, sir. He is out to-day with a friend of ours as \u0027as got a barrow, and lives in the next street, but who is that hoarse with the cold that he can\u0027t speak out of a whisper; so he offered Evan sixpence to go along with him to do the shouting, and a nice shouting he will make; his voice goes through and through my head when he is only a-talking with his brothers and sisters here, and if[50] anything can bring them to the windows it will be his voice. He offered to come round here with the barrow afore they started off this morning, but says I, \u0027No, Evan; I have a good name in the street, I hope, and don\u0027t wish to be dighted as a nuisance to the neighbourhood, nor to have my neighbours accusing me of a-being the cause of fits in their children.\u0027\" \"I don\u0027t suppose that it would be as bad as that, Mrs. Holl,\" Frank said, laughing. \"However, if his voice is as loud and clear as that, it is evident that he is not much the worse for his cold bath. I came round partly to see him, partly to know if I could do anything for him; he seems a sharp lad, and I am sure he is as honest as he is plucky. As a beginning, my uncle says he could come into the house as a sort of errand-boy, and to help the footman, until he can hear of some better position for him among his friends.\" \"I am sure you are very good, sir,\" Mrs. Holl said gratefully; \"I will mention it to his father, and he—— But I doubt whether Evan\u0027s steady enough for a place yet, he is allus getting into mischief; there never was such a boy for scrapes; if all my eight were like him I should go clean mad afore the week was out. When he is in the house, as long as he is talking or singing I can go on with my work, but the moment that he is quiet I have to drop what I am a-doing on and look arter him, for he is sure to be up to some mischief or other.\" \"No, no, mother,\" Harry put in, laughing; \"you are giving Evan a worse character than he deserves. He is up to fun, as is only natural with one who has got the free use of his limbs, but he never does any real harm.\" \"No, I don\u0027t say that he does real harm, \u0027Arry,\" Mrs.[51] Holl replied, \"but I do say as at present he is too full of boyish tricks to be of any good in a place, and we should be a-having him back here a week arter he went, and that would be a nice show of gratitude to this gentleman for his kindness.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose he is as bad as you make out, Mrs. Holl; and no doubt he would tame down after a time, just as other boys do. Perhaps a place in a warehouse would be more suitable for him at first. \"And it was you who were playing as I came in,\" he went on, noticing the violin; \"I was wondering who was playing so well. How jolly it must be to play! I wish I could, but I should never have patience to learn. Who taught you?\" \"I picked it up myself, sir,\" Harry replied, \"from a book father bought me. You see I have plenty of time on my hands; I don\u0027t get out much, except just along the street, for I can\u0027t very well get across crossings by myself. The wheels go well enough on a level, but I cannot push them up a curb-stone. But what with reading and fiddling the days pass quickly enough, especially when mother is at home; she is out two or three days a week, and then the time seems rather long.\" \"I should think so,\" Frank said; \"I should go mad if I were laid up entirely. I am awfully sorry for you. If you are fond of books I shall be glad to let you have some; I have got no end of them, and there they stand on my shelf unopened from year\u0027s end to year\u0027s end. What sort of books do you like best? Sea stories, or Indians, or what?\" \"I should like any story-books, sir,\" Harry replied, his eyes brightening up with pleasure; \"I have read a few[52] which father has picked up for me at the bookstalls, and I have gone through and through them until I could almost say them by heart. And then tales of travel and history,—oh, I love history! to read what people did hundreds of years ago, and how nations grew up step by step, just like children, it is splendid!\" \"I am afraid,\" Frank said, with a laugh, \"that I don\u0027t care so much for history as you do. Names are hard enough to remember, but dates are awful; I would rather do the toughest bit of construing than have a page of Greek history to get up. Well, I will certainly look you up some books on history and some travels, and will send you some of Marryat\u0027s stories. I suppose you do not care for schoolbooks; I have got a barrow-load that I shall never want again.\" \"Oh yes, sir,\" Harry said eagerly, \"I think I should like those best of all. Have you a Virgil, sir? I do like Virgil, and all that story about the siege of Troy. I only had it for a fortnight. Father bought it for me, and then one of the little ones managed somehow to take it out and lose it; she ran out with it for a bit of fun, and we suppose sat down on a doorstep and forgot it.\" \"But, bless me,\" Frank exclaimed, \"you don\u0027t mean to say that you read Virgil in Latin! You are a rum fellow. How on earth did you learn it?\" \"I have taught myself, sir,\" Harry said. \"Father is awfully good, and often picks up books for me at old bookstalls. Of course sometimes he gets things I can\u0027t make out. But he got twelve once for a shilling, and there was a Latin Grammar and Dictionary among them; and when I had learned the Grammar, it was very easy with the Dictionary to make out the sense of some of the Latin books.[53] But of course I often come across things that I don\u0027t understand. I think sometimes if some one would explain them to me once or twice, so that I could really understand how the rules in the Grammar are applied, I could get on faster.\" \"Well, you are a rum fellow!\" Frank exclaimed again. \"I wish I liked learning as you do, for though I am in the Sixth at Westminster, I own that I look upon the classics as a nuisance. Well, now, look here; I have got an hour at present with nothing special to do, so if you like we will have a go at it together. What have you got here?\" and he walked across to a shelf on which were a number of books. \"Oh! here is a C?sar; suppose we take that; it\u0027s easy enough generally, but there are some stiffish bits now and then. Let\u0027s start off from the beginning, and perhaps I may be able to make things clear for you a bit.\" In spite of Mrs. Holl\u0027s protestations that Harry ought not to trouble the gentleman, the two lads were soon deep in their C?sar. Frank found, to his surprise, that the cripple boy had a wonderful knack of grasping the sense of passages, but that never having been regularly taught to construe, he was unable to apply the rules of grammar which he had learned. Frank taught him how to do this, how to take a sentence to pieces, how to parse it word by word, and to see how each word depended upon the others, so that even if absolutely in ignorance of the meaning of any one word in a sentence, he could nevertheless parse them unerringly in the order in which they would be rendered in English—could determine the value of each, and their bearing upon one another. This was quite a revelation to Harry; his face flushed[54] with eagerness and excitement, and so interested were both lads in their work, that the hour was far exceeded before the lesson came to an end by Mrs. Holl interfering bodily in the matter by carrying off the Dictionary, and declaring that it was a shame that Harry should give so much trouble. \"It is no trouble at all, Mrs. Holl,\" Frank said, laughing. \"You see one is accustomed a little to teaching, as one often gives one\u0027s fag, or any other little chap who asks, a construe, or explains his lesson to him. But I can tell you that there are precious few of them who take it all in as quickly as your son does. Now that I have made myself at home, I will come in sometimes when school begins again, if you will let me, for half an hour and read with Harry. But I don\u0027t think he will want any help long. Still, it may help to show him the regular way of getting at things. And now I must hurry off. You will ask Evan to think over what I have said. Here is my address. I wrote it down in case I should find no one in. If he makes up his mind about it before I come again, he had better call on me there; the best time would be between nine and eleven in the morning; I have always finished breakfast by nine, and I have put off my holiday task so long, that I must stick at it regularly two hours a day till school begins again, so he will be pretty sure to find me between nine and eleven. Will you tell your husband not to worry himself about seeing me? I don\u0027t want to be thanked, for it was, as I told you, a sort of partnership business between your boy and me.\" \"Now I call that a downright nice sort of young chap,\" Mrs. Holl said, as their visitor departed, \"good-hearted and good-natured, without no sort of nonsense. He just sits[55] himself down and makes himself at home as if he was one of the family, and I was able to go on with my washing just as if he hadn\u0027t been here.\" For a time Harry did not answer. \"So, that\u0027s a gentleman,\" he said at last, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud; \"I have never spoken to a gentleman before.\" \"Well, lad,\" Sarah Holl said, \"there ain\u0027t much difference between the gentry and other sorts. I don\u0027t see very much of them myself in the houses I goes to, but I hears plenty about them from the servants\u0027 talk; and, judging from that, a great many of them \u0027as just as nasty and unpleasant ways as other people.\" \"I suppose,\" Harry said thoughtfully, \"there can\u0027t be much difference in real nature between them and us; there must, of course, be good and bad among them; but there is more difference in their way of talking than I expected.\" \"Well, of course, Harry; they have had education, that accounts for it; just the same as you, who have educated yourself wonderful, talks different to John and me and the rest of us.\" \"Yes,\" Harry said; \"but I am not talking about mistakes in grammar; it\u0027s the tone of voice, and the way of speaking that\u0027s so different. Now why should that be, mother?\" \"I suppose a good deal of it,\" Mrs. Holl answered, \"is because they are brought up in nusseries, and they can\u0027t run about the house, or holloa or shout to each other in the streets. D\u0027 ye see they are taught to speak quiet, and they hear their fathers and mothers, and people round them, speaking quiet. You dun\u0027t know, Harry, how still[56] it is in some of them big houses, you seem half afraid to speak above a whisper.\" \"Yes, but I don\u0027t think he spoke lower than I do, mother, or than the rest of us. O mother!\" he went on, after a while, \"isn\u0027t he good? Just to think of his spending an hour and a half sitting here, showing me how to construe. Why, I see the whole thing in a different way now; he has made clear all sorts of things that I could not understand; and he said he would come again too, and I am quite sure that when he says a thing he means to do it. I don\u0027t believe he could tell a lie if he tried. And is he not good-looking too?\" \"He is a pleasant-looking young chap,\" Mrs. Holl replied, \"but I should not call him anything out of the way. Now I should call you a better-looking chap than he is, Harry.\" \"O mother, what an idea!\" Harry exclaimed, quite shocked at what seemed to him a most disrespectful comparison to his hero. \"It ain\u0027t no idea at all,\" Mrs. Holl rejoined stoutly; \"any one with eyes in his head could see that if you was dressed the same as he is you would be a sight the best-looking chap of the two.\" \"Ah mother!\" Harry said, laughing, \"you remind me of an old saying I saw in a book the other day, \u0027A mother\u0027s geese are all swans.\u0027\" \"I am sure,\" Mrs. Holl said, in an aggrieved voice, \"you ain\u0027t no goose, Harry, and if any one else said so I should give them a bit of my mind sharp enough.\" Harry did not attempt to argue with her, but with a little laugh turned to his books again, and was soon deep in the mysteries of C?sar.[57] The next day a carrier\u0027s cart stopped before Mrs. Holl\u0027s house, to the great amazement of the neighbourhood—for such an occurrence had not been known in the memory of the oldest inhabitant in the street, and quite a crowd of children collected to witness the delivery of a square heavy box of considerable weight at the door. Harry was almost beside himself with delight as he took out the treasures it contained; and as fully half were story-books, his delight was shared by the rest of the young Holls. It was evening when the cart arrived, and John was just enjoying his first pipe, and he once more uttered the sentiment he had expressed so often during the last four days, \"I should like to shake that young chap by the hand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86704.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
