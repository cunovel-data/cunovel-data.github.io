{"id":27789,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. A COLD SWIM.","content":"I T is winter. Christmas is close at hand, and promises to be a bitterly cold one. The ice has formed smooth and black across the Serpentine, and a number of people are walking along by its banks, looking forward to some grand skating if the frost does but hold two days longer. The sky is blue, and the sun shining brightly; the wind is fresh and keen; it is just the day when people well-clad, well-fed, and in strong health, feel their blood dancing more freely than usual through their veins, and experience an unusual exhilaration of spirits. Merry laughter often rises from the groups on the bank, and the air rings with the sharp sound made by pieces of ice sent skimming by mischievous boys over the glassy surface, to the disgust of skaters, who foresee future falls as the result of these fragments should a slight thaw freeze them to the surface. Among those walking by the edge of the ice were Frank Norris and Fred Barkley; with them was a bright-faced girl of some fourteen years old. Alice Hardy was cousin to both the young fellows, and was a ward of their uncle, Captain Bayley, an old and very wealthy retired officer of the East India Company\u0027s Service.[26] His fortune had not been acquired in India, but had descended to him from his father, of whom he had been the youngest son. His elder brothers had died off one by one, all unmarried or childless, and soon after he obtained his commission he was recalled home to take his place as the next heir to his father\u0027s estates; then he had married. Soon after he succeeded to the property his wife died, leaving him a little girl, who was called Ella after her. Captain Bayley was hot and passionate. His daughter grew up fiery and proud. Her father was passionately fond of her; but just when she reached the age of twenty, and had taken her place as one of the leading belles of Worcestershire, she disappeared suddenly from the circle of her acquaintances. What had happened no one ever knew. That there had been some terrible quarrel was certain. It was understood that Captain Bayley wished no questions to be asked. Her disappearance was a nine days\u0027 wonder in Worcestershire. Some said she had turned Roman Catholic and gone into a convent; others that she must have eloped, although with whom no one could guess. But at last the subject died out, until two years later Captain Bayley and his household appeared in mourning, and it was briefly announced that his daughter was dead. Captain Bayley went about as before, peppery, kind-hearted, perhaps a little harder and more cynical than before, but a very popular personage in Worcestershire. Those who knew him best thought him the most altered, and said that although he appeared to bear the blow lightly he felt deeply at heart the death of his daughter. His nearest heirs now were his two nephews, Frank Norris and Barkley, sons of his married sisters. Alice Hardy bore no relation to him. For some years speculation[27] had been rife as to which of his two nephews he would select as his heir. Two years before this story begins Alice Hardy\u0027s father and mother had both died of typhoid fever, leaving Captain Bayley as guardian to their daughter. Somewhat to the surprise of his friends, the old officer not only accepted the trust, but had Alice installed at his house, there to be educated by a governess instead of being sent to school. But although in a short time she came to be regarded as the daughter of the house, no one thought that Captain Bayley would make her his heiress, as she had inherited a considerable fortune from her father; and the two lads at Westminster were still regarded as rivals for the heirship. Captain Bayley had never been on good terms with either of his brothers-in-law; both had been merchants in the city, and the old officer considered that his sisters had made mesalliances in marrying them. Frank\u0027s father and mother had died within a few months of each other, when he was about twelve years old; Captain Bayley\u0027s house had since been his home. Fred was often invited to stay with his uncle down in Worcestershire, and his London house in Eaton Square was always open to him. Frank had never counted on the probability of his uncle leaving him any money. Certainly he never for a moment built castles in the air founded upon the chance of the inheritance. His father had been an easy-going and somewhat careless man, and would sometimes laugh with the boy in speaking of his future and predicting what he would do if he were come into old Bayley\u0027s estates. None of the Captain\u0027s intimates could—had they been asked—have declared a preference for[28] the chances of either lad. Fred was certainly the cleverest. He had gone into college head of his year, and would have been Captain, had not one of those of the year before him, who had got into College under age, elected to stay a year longer at school, and therefore by right became Captain, while Fred had to be content with the honours of head monitor. Frank, on the other hand, had failed to get into College at all, and had remained a town boy. Although it could not be said of Fred that in any open way he laid himself out to gain his uncle\u0027s favour, he was yet decidedly more attentive than was Frank, and would give up any other engagement he might have if Captain Bayley invited him to stay the Saturday and Sunday in Eaton Square, while Frank went carelessly his own way. And while there was nothing in the smallest degree servile in Fred\u0027s manner—for this indeed Captain Bayley would have instantly noticed and resented—there was just that slight deference which a young fellow should exhibit in conversation with an elder, while Frank, on the other hand, carelessly expressed his own opinion and ideas, which often differed very widely from those of the old officer. Captain Bayley\u0027s own manner evinced no shade of partiality for one nephew over the other; and although Alice had a sort of faint suspicion that Frank, who was certainly her own favourite, was also that of her uncle, she could have given no reason for her belief. In person the cousins were remarkably dissimilar. Frank was two inches the tallest, and had a still greater advantage in width. It was clear that he would grow into a big man, but his figure was at present loose and[29] unformed; he had dark brown hair, with a slight wave, and would hardly have been called good-looking, were it not for his open, fearless expression and merry smile. Fred\u0027s figure, although less strongly built, was far more formed, and it was probable that years would effect but little change in it. There was a sinew and wire in his frame which would have told an athlete of great latent strength in the slight figure. His hair was light, his features clear and sharply cut, and the face a decidedly intellectual one. His manner was somewhat cold and restrained, but pleasant and courteous to men older than himself; both young fellows carried themselves well, with a certain ease of bearing, and that nameless air of command which distinguish most young men who have passed through the upper forms of a great public school. Both lads had their circle of friends and admirers at school, but Frank\u0027s was by far the largest. He was indeed universally popular, which was far from being the case with his cousin. Upon the other hand, while Frank seemed to be a sort of common property of the School, it was somehow esteemed by those in Barkley\u0027s set a special distinction to be admitted to his friendship. But the party of three young people have been left long enough walking by the edge of the Serpentine. Presently they saw a knot of people gathered ahead; the number increased as others ran up. \"What\u0027s up, I wonder?\" Frank said. \"Look out there on the ice, Alice. You see that hole; there is something moving—there\u0027s a dog\u0027s head, I declare. Poor brute! it has run out after a stick, I suppose, and the ice has given under it.\"[30] \"Poor little thing!\" Alice exclaimed pitifully, \"can\u0027t it get out? Do you think it will be drowned, Frank? Can nothing be done for it?\" \"The best thing you can do, Alice,\" Fred replied, as Frank stood looking at the dog, who tried several times, but in vain, to scramble out, the ice each time breaking with its weight, \"will be to turn and walk away; there is no use standing here harrowing your feelings by watching that poor little brute drown.\" \"Can nothing be done, Frank?\" Alice again asked, paying no heed to Fred\u0027s suggestion. \"That is just what I am thinking,\" Frank replied. \"You stop here, Alice, with Fred. I will go on and see what they are doing.\" \"Can\u0027t I go with you, Frank?\" \"You had better stop here,\" Frank replied; \"the crowd is getting thick there, and they are a roughish lot. Besides, you will not be able to see over their heads, and can do no good; so just do as I bid you.\" The girl remained obediently with her cousin Fred, while Frank went off at a run towards the group. \"Frank orders you about just as if you were his fag,\" Fred said, with a smile which had in it something of a sneer. \"I don\u0027t mind,\" the girl said staunchly, \"it\u0027s Frank\u0027s way, and I like it;—at any rate one always knows what Frank means, and he always means well.\" \"That is as much as to say, Alice, that you don\u0027t always understand what I mean, and that I don\u0027t always mean well,\" Fred Barkley said in a quiet tone, but with a little flush of anger in his usually somewhat pale cheeks.[31] \"No, I don\u0027t know that I mean that,\" Alice said carelessly; \"but I do not always understand what you mean, though I always understand what you say.\" \"I should have thought that was the same thing,\" Fred replied. \"Should you?\" Alice rejoined. \"Well I shouldn\u0027t, that\u0027s all.\" As Frank Norris approached the group he began to unbutton his collar and waistcoat. \"It will be a beastly cold swim,\" he grumbled to himself, \"but I can\u0027t see the poor little brute drowned, and drowned he certainly will be if no one goes in for him. It\u0027s no distance to swim, and I should think one could wade to within twenty yards of him; but it certainly will be horribly cold.\" And he gave a shiver of anticipation as he looked at the smooth frozen surface. With some little difficulty Frank pushed his way through to the centre of the group by the water\u0027s side. A little girl, poorly dressed, was standing crying bitterly; a cripple boy in a box upon wheels was trying to pacify her, while another who had taken off his coat and waistcoat, and laid them in the lap of the cripple, was unlacing his boots. \"Are you going in, young un?\" Frank said, as he joined them. \"Yes, sir; I am going in for Flossy. She belongs to this little girl, who is one of our neighbours.\" \"Can you swim well?\" Frank asked, \"for the water will be bitterly cold.\" \"Yes,\" the boy answered confidently, \"I goes regularly for a swim above Vauxhall Bridge in the summer, and keeps on until the water gets too cold. I can do that[32] fast enough. I suppose the ice will break right enough,\" and he looked up inquiringly at Frank. THE RESCUE FROM THE SERPENTINE. THE RESCUE FROM THE SERPENTINE. \"Yes, it will break with your weight easily enough; you will have to raise yourself a little so as to break it before you. You will have to put some weight on, for it is nearly half an inch thick; I expect there is a thin place where the dog has fallen in—a spring underneath, most likely, so a mere skin has formed. \"Look here, young un, I was going in if you hadn\u0027t. I shall get my boots ready to kick off now, so don\u0027t you be frightened if you get numbed with the cold, or a touch of cramp; just sing out and I will be with you in a minute.\" The cripple looked with pleasure up into Frank\u0027s face. \"It is very good of you, sir, for you don\u0027t know the dog as Evan does. Ah! I know your face, sir,\" he broke off, \"I saw you in the fight down by our place at Westminster, when Evan ran up and fetched some more of your chaps—and just in time they were too.\" \"Oh! was it your brother who brought that news?\" Frank said quickly; \"then I owe him one, and if I go in to fetch him out we shall be only quits.\" Evan had by this time entered the water, breaking the ice before him as he went. \"My eye, ain\u0027t it cold!\" he said, half-turning round, \"seems to nip one\u0027s legs up regular. All right, Flossy,\" he shouted to the dog, as he continued his way out, in answer to a pitiful whine of the struggling animal. For the first few paces Evan\u0027s progress was easy enough; but when he got so deep that he could no longer break the ice with his foot his difficulties began, and it was only by flinging himself down upon it that he was able to break it. A few yards further on the water[33] was up to his chin. He was now breaking the ice by trying to climb upon it. Frank was watching him closely, and noticed that he no longer proceeded about his work deliberately, but with a hurried and jerky action, as if he felt his strength failing him. Frank pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and handed them to the cripple, kicked off his boots, and stood in readiness to plunge in. The crowd had at first cheered the lad as he made his way from the shore; some still uttered shouts of encouragement, others saw that he was getting exhausted, and called to him to return. Suddenly the boy seemed to lose his power altogether, held on to the edge of the ice, and cast a despairing look towards the shore. Then gradually his head disappeared under the water; but Frank was already half-way towards him. A few strides had taken him through the shallow water, and he swam with vigorous strokes through the floating fragments to the end of the line of broken water; then he too disappeared for a moment. A dead silence reigned through the crowd; but when two heads appeared above the water together, a ringing cheer broke out. Carrying his senseless companion, Frank swam back to shore. \"Take off his wet clothes,\" he said, as he handed his burden to some of the men. \"Wrap him up in my coat and his own, and then run with him up to the Humane Society\u0027s House, they will bring him round in no time; it is cold, not drowning.\" Then he looked again across the water. The little dog was swimming feebly now, its nose scarcely above the surface. It had given a plaintive cry of despair as it saw those who had approached so near turn back, for there were but some five yards between the spot where the[34] boy\u0027s strength had failed and the circle which it had broken in its efforts to climb out. \"I can\u0027t be colder than I am,\" Frank said to himself, \"so here goes.\" Accordingly he again dashed into the water and swam to the end of the narrow passage; a few vigorous strokes broke the intervening barrier of ice. He seized the little dog, put it on the ice, and with a push sent it sliding towards the shore, and then turned and swam back again. It was only just where the dog had fallen in that the ice was too weak to bear its weight, and, after lying for two or three minutes utterly exhausted, it scrambled to its feet and made its way to the bank, where it was soon wrapped in the apron of its delighted mistress. Frank, on reaching the shore, was scarcely able to stand, so benumbed were his legs by the cold. His cousins had made their way through the crowd to the spot. \"O Frank,\" Alice exclaimed, \"what a mad thing for you to do. Oh! I am so pleased you did it—but oh, you do look cold! What will you do?\" \"I am all right, Alice,\" Frank said, as cheerfully as his chattering teeth would allow him to speak. \"You go home with Fred; I shall get a hot bath and have my clothes dried at the receiving-house, and shall be as right as a trivet in half an hour. There, good-bye!\" Frank walked stiffly at first, but was presently able to break into a run, which he kept up until he reached the establishment of the Royal Humane Society. His first question, as he entered, was for the boy. \"He will do, sir,\" the attendant answered, \"we popped[35] him at once into a hot bath we had ready, and he has opened his eyes, and is able to speak; we have just got him into bed between warm blankets, and now it\u0027s your turn.\" In another minute Frank was in the bath from which the boy had just been taken, for there was no time to prepare another. For the first minute or two he felt an intense pain as the blood flowed back into his chilled limbs, then a delightful sensation of warmth and comfort stole over him; a glass of hot brandy and water completed his cure, and a few minutes later he felt that he was fast going off to sleep in the warm blankets between which he was laid. Before the crowd whom the incident on the Serpentine had gathered broke up, one or two of those present went among the rest and collected a subscription for the lad who had gone in after the dog. Nearly two pounds were collected in silver and coppers, and handed over to the cripple to give to his brother. Fred Barkley dropped in five shillings, and Alice Hardy the same sum. Then after walking to the receiving-house, and hearing that Frank and the lad had both recovered from the effects of the cold, and would probably be all right after a few hours\u0027 sleep, they returned home, Alice in a high state of excitement over the adventure which she had witnessed, Fred silent and gloomy. He accompanied Alice to Eaton Square, and was present when she related to her uncle the story of the lad going in to rescue the dog, and of Frank going in to rescue the boy, and of his afterwards returning to set free the dog. Upon the way home he had appeared to Alice to take the matter exceedingly quietly, but he now,[36] somewhat to her surprise, appeared almost as enthusiastic as herself, and spoke in terms of high admiration of Frank\u0027s conduct. Captain Bayley, as was usually the case with him, took a view of the matter entirely opposed to that of the speakers. \"Stuff and nonsense!\" he said. \"You call that a gallant action? I call it a foolish boy\u0027s trick. What right has Frank to risk getting rheumatic fever, and being laid up as a cripple for life, merely to save a dog?\" \"But he went in to save a boy, uncle,\" Alice said indignantly. \"Pooh, pooh!\" the old officer exclaimed, \"the boy would never have gone in if he hadn\u0027t encouraged him. That makes the case all the worse. Frank not only risking catching rheumatism himself, but he risked the life of that boy by encouraging him to do such a foolish action. It was a hair-brained business altogether, sir; and I am glad you had the wisdom, Fred, to keep out of it. The idea of two lives being risked to save that of a wretched cur is too absurd; if you had offered the girl who owned it five shillings to buy another it would have been more sensible.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you mean what you say a bit, Uncle Harry,\" Alice exclaimed indignantly. \"I believe if you had been there, and had heard that poor little dog\u0027s cries as we did, you would have gone in yourself. I am sure I would if I had been a man.\" \"I always observe, my dear,\" Captain Bayley said sarcastically, \"that women would do wonderful things if they had only been born men. Nature appears to be always making mistakes by putting the dauntless and heroic spirits into female bodies, and vice versa.\" \"I don\u0027t like you when you talk like that, Uncle Harry—that[37] is, I shouldn\u0027t like you if I thought you meant it; but you only talk so out of contradiction. If I had said I thought Frank was very foolish for having gone into the water, you would have taken the opposite side directly.\" \"You are an impudent puss, Miss Alice,\" her uncle retorted, \"and I shall have to tell Miss Lancaster that unless she can keep you in better order I shall have to send you to school. You appear to have been born without the bump of veneration.\" \"I would venerate you ever so much, Uncle Harry,\" the girl replied, laughing, \"if you would always be good and reasonable; but I cannot venerate you when you are contrary and disagreeable, and say things you don\u0027t mean.\" As Fred Barkley walked home, he wondered again and again to himself whether Captain Bayley had meant what he said, and whether this act of Frank\u0027s would raise him in his opinion or the contrary; but he flattered himself that, at any rate, no harm had been done, for his own advocacy of his cousin could not but have placed him in the most favourable light. Fred Barkley was shrewd, but his power of reading character was, as yet, by no means perfect, and his uncle\u0027s changing moods baffled the power of analysis. He would not have been pleased had he known that at that very moment the old officer was walking up and down his library, muttering to himself, \"I would give a good deal if there were a glass window at that boy Fred\u0027s heart, that I could see what it is really made of. His head is strong enough; nature has given him a fair share of brains, but, unless I am greatly mistaken, there is a very grievous deficiency in his allowance of heart. \"I don\u0027t believe the boy ever spoke spontaneously from[38] the time he learned to talk, but that every word he says is weighed before it passes through his lips, and its effect calculated; whereas Frank never thinks at all, but just blurts out the words which come to hand. It is curious how much more Alice takes to him than to Fred, for he bullies her and orders her about as if she were one of his fags, while Fred is as courteous and polite to her as if she were a young Countess. I suppose it is instinct, for children\u0027s opinions about people are seldom far wrong. I thought when I brought Alice here that she would help me to settle the problem.\" Frank and Evan Holl woke at about the same time, after sleeping for some hours; their clothes had been dried for them, and they at once began to dress. \"How do you feel now, young un?\" was Frank\u0027s first inquiry as they sat up in their beds. \"I dunno how I feels,\" Evan replied. \"I hardly knows where I am, or how I got here, though I do seem to remember something about this \u0027ere place too. Oh yes!\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"I was trying to fetch out poor little Flossy, and the ice would not break, and I got colder and colder, and then I don\u0027t seem to remember any more except somehow that I was here with people standing round me, and I swallowed something hot and went off to sleep. Ah yes! you were the gentleman as said you would come in after me if I sang out.\" \"And I did come in,\" Frank said smilingly, \"and only just in time I was, for you did not sing out, but went right down without a word. It was lucky you did not get under the ice.\" \"And Flossy,\" the boy said suddenly, \"did she go down too?\"[39] \"No,\" Frank answered, \"I went in again and got her out, after I had brought you back to shore.\" \"Well, you are a brick!\" the boy said, \"a regular downright un, and no mistake. I wonder how Harry got back; it would be a job for him to wheel hisself all the way back to Westminster.\" \"Oh, I expect he got some one to help him,\" Frank said; \"and the little girl would be able to help shove him along.\" \"Yes, she would,\" Evan replied, \"she can shove him by herself along a pavement, and I expect that he and she atween them would be able to get along. Lor! how them things of yours have shrunk, to be sure.\" \"They have, a bit,\" Frank said, looking down at his trousers, which were half-way up to his knees; \"but it don\u0027t matter much, it\u0027s getting dark now, and I can take a cab when I get out of the Park. Your clothes don\u0027t seem to have suffered so much, they seem plenty large enough for you now.\" \"Yes,\" Evan said, with a satisfied air, \"and a good job too; mother always will have my clothes so big, cos of my growing. She always seems to think one will grow sudden into a man afore one\u0027s things wear out.\" Frank and the lad walked together as far as Albert Gate; here they separated, Frank taking a cab home, while Evan, whistling a popular air in a high key, took his way to Westminster. On arriving home he was greeted with enthusiasm by Harry, but Mrs. Holl was not inclined to view his adventure favourably. \"It\u0027s all very well to care for dogs, Evan, and I ain\u0027t a-saying as Carrie Hill\u0027s dog ain\u0027t a nice little critter; but when it comes to getting into the freezing water arter it,[40] I don\u0027t hold to it no way. Then you might have gone and got drowned—and you would have got drowned too, Harry tells me, if that young gent hadn\u0027t been and gone after you; and then this blessed minute I should have been breaking my heart about you, and you down underneath the ice in the bottom of the Serpentine. There ain\u0027t no reason in it, my boy. Harry here thinks different about it, and will have it that I ought to be proud of yer; but he ain\u0027t a mother, and so can\u0027t understand a mother\u0027s feelings—and your clothes pretty nigh spoilt too, I\u0027ll be bound.\" \"Well, mother, if they are,\" Harry said cheerfully, \"Evan can buy some more. Here, Evan; here are thirty-eight shillings and ninepence halfpenny, and it\u0027s all your own.\" \"Crikey!\" Evan gasped, looking in astonishment at the pile of money in Harry\u0027s lap. \"Why, where did all that \u0027ere money come from?\" \"That was collected in the crowd, Evan, after you were carried away, and they gave it to me to give to you. I did not quite like your taking money for doing such a thing, but of course as it was given for you I had nothing to say to it.\" Evan burst into a wild dance expressive of delight. He had none of his brother\u0027s scruples in respect to the money. \"My eye!\" he exclaimed at last, \"thirty-eight bob and some coppers to do just as I likes with. I am a rich man, I am; I shall have to get some \u0027igh collars and come the swell. I suppose it won\u0027t run to a carriage and pair, mother, or to a welvet gownd for you,—that would be splendatious. Just fancy, mother, a gownd all over welvet,[41] and just the same colour as the sodgers\u0027 coats. My eye! won\u0027t that be grand?\" \"And a nice sight I should look in it,\" Mrs. Holl said, laughing at the thought of herself in scarlet robes. \"When dad comes home we will talk over with him what\u0027s the best way of laying out this money. It\u0027s yours to do as you likes with, but I ain\u0027t a-going to have it fooled away, so don\u0027t you make any mistake about that.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86703.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
