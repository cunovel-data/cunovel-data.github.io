{"id":27800,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. AT THE GOLD-FIELDS.","content":"I T was with intense delight that all in the caravan noticed the gradual change of herbage which showed that they were approaching the confines of this terrible region; and when, at their first halt after leaving it, they came upon flowing streams, a general bath was indulged in by man and beast, the oxen lying down in the water, and being with great difficulty induced to emerge from it. The hunters now recommenced their excursions in search of game, for all were suffering from the want of fresh meat, the children especially feeling the privation. Turk accompanied the party. The dog was now completely restored, and nothing could induce it to leave Frank\u0027s side. It was quite young, and Frank soon taught it to remain by his horse while he dismounted to stalk game; while in pursuit on horseback, Turk often pursued and pulled down deer who would otherwise have escaped. One day Dick and Frank had gone out alone, and had been led a long distance from the line of march in pursuit of a herd of deer. These had finally gone up a narrow ca?on in the mountains. The hunters pursued them for[224] some distance, and then, despairing of overtaking them, turned their horses, and began to retrace their steps. Suddenly Turk, who was in advance, stopped, uttered a deep growl, and its hair bristled from its head to its tail. \"What is it, Turk?\" Frank asked. The animal replied with another low, deep growl. \"It must be some savage beast,\" Frank said. \"That ain\u0027t likely,\" Dick said; \"any beast in this ca?on would have moved away when we passed before. I think the dog must scent Injins. A party may have seen us entering the gap, and may be in pursuit.\" He threw himself off his horse, and listened, with his ear to the ground. \"It\u0027s Injins, sure enough!\" he exclaimed; \"I can hear the clattering of horses\u0027 hoofs on the hard rock. There\u0027s nothing for it but for us to make our way up the ca?on.\" They turned their horses, and galloped forward, Turk, after one more growl in the direction of the Indians, following. Presently the defile divided. \"Shall we take the main branch, or the one to the right?\" Frank asked. \"Better keep straight on,\" Dick said; \"the other may lead into some valley from which there could be no getting out, and we should be caught in a trap. See!\" he said, as he halted, \"the deer have gone that way. Do you see some of the pebbles have been thrown out of that little stream? \"Jump off your horse, and cut some bits off your blankets and tie them round your horse\u0027s feet. If the Indians see no marks going forward, they will naturally suppose we have turned off here in pursuit of the deer.\"[225] Frank did what his comrade suggested; but quickly as the work was performed, they heard the sound of the horsemen in pursuit, loud and distinct, before they again set forward. Then, springing on their horses, they rode up the ca?on. After a while they halted; the sounds of pursuit had ceased, and they had no doubt the Indians had turned off into the other ravine. \"It all depends how far that runs,\" Dick said, \"how soon they will be in pursuit again. If it comes soon to an end it will not be long before we have them after us; if it goes on for some miles we are safe.\" Winding between perpendicular cliffs of great height, they rode forward, mounting steadily. It was impossible to make rapid progress, for although in some places the bottom of the ravine was bare, smooth rock, at others it was piled with boulders. It was three hours before they emerged from it, and upon doing so found they were upon an elevated plateau. Before they moved forward, Frank said, \"Turk, do you hear them?\" The dog stood with ears erect and quivering nostrils, looking down the ravine which they had just left. Presently he gave a low, deep growl. \"They are coming,\" Frank said; \"but they must be a good way off, for Turk did not hear them at first. Which way shall we go, Dick?\" \"We had better turn to the left,\" Dick said, \"for our natural line leads to the right. However, it does not make much difference, for they will be able to track us; still, it may puzzle them. It will be dark in a couple of hours, and if we can keep ahead till then we are safe.\" They started at a gallop, and for an hour rode at full speed in the direction which would take them down to the[226] plain at or near the spot where they had halted the night before. \"Look out, Frank! rein up!\" Dick suddenly shouted. Frank pulled his horse back on its haunches, and but just in time, for at the brow of the swell up which they had been galloping, the ground fell suddenly away in a precipice two hundred feet deep, and the horse was barely a length from it when he brought it to a standstill. \"We are in a mess,\" Dick said. \"The Injins behind us will know of this, and instead of following will scatter to the right and left, as they will know that we must turn one way or the other.\" \"In that case,\" Frank said, \"our best plan will be to go straight back.\" \"You are right,\" Dick exclaimed, \"that is the best thing we can do. We won\u0027t follow the exact track, as a few of them may have kept our line, but will bear a little distance off it, and hope they may pass us unseen; the sun is setting already, half an hour and it will be dark.\" Taking every precaution to conceal their trail, they rode back, keeping a hundred yards or so to the right of the line by which they had come. A quarter of an hour passed, and then Turk gave his growl of warning. \"Could not have been better,\" Dick exclaimed, \"this brushwood is just the place for us.\" They threw themselves from their horses, and made the animals lie down at full length in the low bushes, and laid themselves down beside them. \"Hush! Turk,\" Frank said to the dog, as he laid his hand upon it\u0027s head. \"You must lie quiet, sir, and not make the least noise.\"[227] DICK AND FRANK ELUDE THE INDIANS. DICK AND FRANK ELUDE THE INDIANS. The dog, who was quivering with excitement, lay down quietly, as if it comprehended the need for silence. \"One, two, three, four, five, six,\" Dick counted, peering through the bushes. \"Six of them; we could fight that lot easy, but the sound of our rifles would bring the whole gang down upon us.\" The Indians were not riding at full speed, for their horses were tired, having already made a long march before they saw the hunters following the deer to the ca?on, and they did not expect to overtake those of whom they were in pursuit, believing that when they reached the precipice they would make along it to the right or left, and so fall into the hands of one or other of the parties who had gone to intercept them. No sooner were they fairly out of sight than the hunters rose, and, remounting their horses, continued their way. \"It\u0027s well-nigh dark,\" Dick said, \"and I doubt if they will be able to make out our back-track when they get to the edge; at any rate they cannot follow it.\" They rode on until they found that their horses could no longer carry them, then, dismounting, led them by the bridle. They had been steering by the stars, and presently found themselves at the upper end of the ravine. \"We won\u0027t enter this now,\" Dick said, \"for some of them may take it into their heads to gallop back, although that ain\u0027t very likely. Anyhow the horses can\u0027t go any further, and if they could, we couldn\u0027t make our way over these stones; it\u0027ll be as dark as pitch down there. So we will move away two hundred yards, and let the horses feed while we get a few hours\u0027 sleep. That dog of yourn will give us notice if any of the varmint are coming this way.\"[228] The night passed without alarm, and at the first dawn of light they were upon their feet again. The horses were given a mouthful of water from the skins, and then the hunters mounted and rode down the ca?on. There would be pursuit, they knew well; but the Indians would not be able to take up the trail until daylight, and would be an hour and a half following it to the top of the ca?on, so that they had fully two hours\u0027 start. This being the case, they did not hurry their horses, but kept up a steady pace until they emerged at the lower end of the ravine; then they urged them forward, and two hours later arrived at the halting-place of the caravan. No move had been made, but the instant they were seen approaching, Abe and his two comrades rode up to meet them. \"What has happened?\" he asked, as he reached them. \"We have been terrible uneasy about you, and I was just going to start to try and pick up your track and follow you.\" Dick related the adventure. \"It war well it war no worse,\" Abe said. \"That critter\u0027s sense has saved your lives, for ef he hadn\u0027t given you warning you would have ridden slap into the hands of the Injins; you may consider you are quits with him now, Frank. But it war a nasty fix, and I congratulate you both on having brought your har safely back to camp; that coming straight back on your trail when you was stopped by the fall of the ground was a judgmatical business.\" \"It was Frank\u0027s idee,\" Dick said. \"Wall, he just hit the right thing; if it hadn\u0027t been for that you would have been rubbed out sure.\" At the next halting-place they found that three or four of the caravans which had preceded them had halted,[229] being afraid to move forward in small parties, as the Indians had made several attacks. With the accession of force given by the arrival of John Little\u0027s party, they considered themselves able to encounter any body of redskins they might meet, as there were now upwards of fifty waggons collected, with a fighting force of seventy or eighty men. They therefore moved forward confidently. Several times parties of Indian horsemen were seen in the distance, but they never showed in force, the strength of the caravan being too great for any hope of a successful attack being made upon it. It was nearly five months from the time of their leaving Omaha before the caravan approached the point where the great plateau of Nevada falls abruptly down to the low lands of California many thousand feet below. Here the hunters bade farewell to the emigrants, whom they had so long escorted. All danger of Indians had been long since passed, and they were now within a short distance of the gold regions. Very deep and sincere were the thanks which were poured upon them by the emigrants, who felt that they owed their lives entirely to the vigilance and bravery of Abe and his companions. They expected to meet again ere long at the gold-fields, and many were the assurances that should by any chance better luck attend their search than was met with by the hunters, the latter should share in their good fortune. The change in the character of the scenery was sudden and surprising. Hitherto the country had been bare and treeless, but the great slopes of the Nevada mountains were covered from top to bottom with a luxuriant growth[230] of timber. Nowhere in the world are finer views to be obtained than on the slopes of the Nevada Mountains. The slopes are extremely precipitous, and sometimes, standing on a crag, one can look down into a valley five or six thousand feet below, clothed from top to bottom with luxuriant foliage, while far away in front, at the mouth of the valley, can be seen the low, rich flats of California. On the lower slopes of these mountains lay the gold deposits. These were found in great beds of gravel and clay, which in countless generations had become so hardened that they almost approached the state of conglomerate. The gold from these beds had been carried, either by streams which ran through them, or by the action of rain and time, into the ravines and valleys, where it was found by the early explorers. These great beds of gravel have been since worked by hydraulic machinery, water being brought by small canals, or flumes, many miles along the face of the hills, to reservoirs situated one or two hundred feet above the gravel to be operated upon. From the reservoirs extremely strong iron pipes lead down to the gravel, and to the end of these pipes are fitted movable nozzles, like those of fire-engines, but far larger. The water pours out through these nozzles with tremendous force, breaking up the gravel, and washing it away down a long series of wooden troughs, in which the gold settles, and is caught by a variety of contrivances. But in the early days of gold discovery the very existence of these beds of gravel was unknown, and gold was obtained only in the ravines and valleys by washing the soil in the bottom. It had already been discovered that the soil was richer the further the searchers went down,[231] by far the greater finds being made when the diggers reached the solid rock at the bottom, in the irregularities of which, worn by water thousands of years before, large quantities of rough gold were often discovered. There was no difficulty in following the track through the forest, and after two days\u0027 travelling the party arrived at the first mining village. They chose a piece of ground for their camp, fastened their horses to stumps, erected a tent of blankets, and placed in it the stores brought on their baggage-horses, which had remained untouched since they started. Then, leaving one of their number in charge, they started off to visit the diggings. The whole of the bottom of the narrow valley was a scene of life and bustle. The existence of gold in the valley had been discovered but three weeks before, but a rush had taken place from other diggings. The ground had been allotted out, and a number of tents pitched, and rough huts erected. Men were working as if for bare life. The lots were small, and the ground was already perfectly honeycombed with holes. Generally the diggers worked in batches of four or five, each member of which took up a claim, so that the space for operations was enlarged. Two men laboured with pick and shovel, and the baskets, as they were filled with earth and sand, were first screened in a sieve to remove the larger portion of stones and rock, and were then poured into what was known as a cradle, which was a long trough on rockers; one man brought water in buckets from the stream, and poured it into this, while another kept the cradle in constant motion. The mud and lighter portions of stone flowed away over the edge, or were swept off by the hand of the[232] men employed in working it, the particles of gold sinking to the bottom of the machine, where they were found at the clean-up at the end of the day\u0027s work. The new-comers looked on with great interest at the work, asking questions as to the luck which attended the operators. The majority gave but a poor account of their luck, the value of the finds at the end of the day being barely sufficient to pay the enormous rate charged for provisions, which had to be carried up from the coast some hundreds of miles away. The stores were brought in waggons as far as Sacramento, and from that town were carried to the diggings on the backs of mules and horses. Consequently it was impossible for a man to live on the poorest necessities of life for less than three or four dollars a day, and in the out-of-the-way valleys the cost was often considerably more. Some of the diggers owned that they were doing well, but there was a general disinclination to state even the approximate amount of their daily winnings. The hunters found, however, that the general belief was that some of those who had claims in the centre of the valley, where of course the gold would settle the thickest, were making from ten to twenty ounces per day. \"That\u0027s something like!\" Dick said. \"Just fancy making from forty to eighty pounds per day. I vote we set to work at once. As well here as anywhere else.\" \"Yes, I suppose we may as well begin here,\" Frank agreed; \"at any rate until we hear what is being done in the other places. But you see we must be ready to move off as soon as a report comes of some fresh discovery, so as to get good places. Here, of course, we must be content to settle down outside the rest. We will mark out five claims at[233] once, turn up the ground, and put our tools there; they say that\u0027s sufficient to take possession. Then we will go up into the forests and cut down a pine or two, and slit it up into planks for making one of those cradles. That will take us all day to-morrow, I reckon.\" As they sat round the fire that evening, talking over their prospects, Abe said— \"I tell you what it is, mates, I have been thinking this here matter over, and when I sees what tremendous prices are being charged for grub here, I concluded there must be a big thing to be made in the way of carrying. Now we have got our five riding-horses, and the three baggage-horses, that makes eight. Now what I proposes is this: three of us shall work the claims, and the other two shall work the horses; we can sell the riding-saddles down at Sacramento, and get pack-saddles instead. We can begin by carrying for one of the traders here. \"I hear that a horse can earn from five to ten dollars a day, so our eight horses will earn forty to eighty dollars a day. Now that\u0027s a good sartin living for us all, especially as we shall bring up the provisions for ourselves, instead of paying big rates here. Arterards we will see how things go, and if we like we can open a store here, and one of us mind it. Anyhow the horses will keep us well. If the claim turns out well, so much the better; if it don\u0027t, we can do very well without it. I proposes as we take it by turns to drive the horses and dig.\" The counsel was good and prudent, but it was only adopted after some discussion, for the sums which the more fortunate diggers were earning were so large that all looked forward to making a rapid fortune, and were inclined to despise the small but steady gains offered by[234] the plan Abe suggested. However, Frank sided with Abe, and offered to go with him on the first trip to Sacramento, and the others thereupon fell in with the plan. The next day the cradle was made by Abe and Frank, the others setting to to dig and wash out in a bucket. At the end of a day of hard work they had got about a quarter of an ounce of glittering yellow dust. This was not paying work, but they were not disappointed; they had not expected to strike upon good ground at the first attempt, and were quite satisfied by the fact that they really had met with the gold which they had come so far to seek. That evening Abe made a bargain to bring up goods from Sacramento for one of the store-keepers, having previously found the rate which was current. At daybreak next morning he and Frank started off on horseback, each with three horses tied, head and tail, behind the one he was riding, Turk marching gravely by their side. The distance to Sacramento was upwards of seventy miles. On their road they met numerous parties making their way up the mountains. All carried a pick and shovel, a bucket and blanket, and a small sack with flour and bacon. Many of them were sailors, who had deserted from their ships at San Francisco, where scores of vessels were lying unable to leave for want of hands. All, as they passed, asked the last news from the diggings, where the last rush was, and what was the average take at the camp, and then hurried on, eager to reach the spot where, as every man believed, fortune awaited him. Two days of travel down the mountains took them to Sacramento. Here their saddles were disposed of, and[235] pack-saddles bought. The horses were laden with sacks of sugar and flour, sides of bacon, and mining tools, and after a day\u0027s stay in town, they started back for the camp. Sacramento, but a few months before a sleepy, quiet city, mostly inhabited by Spaniards, or rather people of Spanish descent, was now a scene of animation and bustle. Long teams of waggons, laden with stores, rolled in almost hourly across the plains from San Francisco, while the wharves at the river-side were surrounded by laden barges. Bands of newly-arrived emigrants wandered through the streets, asking eager questions of any one who had time enough to talk as to the best way of getting to the diggings, and as to the camp which they had better select for their first attempt. Dark-looking men, half Spaniard and half Indian, went along on their little ponies, or rode at the head of a string of laden animals, with an air of perfect indifference to the bustle around them. Sounds of shouting and singing came through the doors of some saloons, in which many of the fortunate diggers were busily engaged in dissipating their hard-earned gains. Men sunburnt almost to blackness, in red shirts and canvas trousers, walked along the streets as if the town and all in it belonged to them in virtue of the store of gold-dust tied up in their waist-belts. In these, revolvers and bowie-knives were stuck conspicuously, and the newly-arrived emigrants looked with awe and envy at these men who had already reaped a harvest at the mines. Shooting affrays were of frequent occurrence in the drinking saloons, where at night gambling was invariably carried on, the diggers being as reckless of their lives as of their money.[236] \"About ten days of that place would be enough to ruin any man,\" Abe said, as they walked at the head of their cavalcade from the town. \"I reckon as Sacramento is a sort of hell on arth, and guess there\u0027s more wickedness goes on in that ere little town than in any other place its own size on the face of creation. They tells me as San Francisco is worse, but at any rate Sacramento is bad enough for me.\" On the evening of the third day after leaving Sacramento they arrived at the mining camp, and having delivered the stores they had brought up to the trader, and received the amount agreed upon, they took their way to the spot where they had pitched their camp. \"Well, lads, what luck?\" Abe asked, as at the sound of their feet their comrades came out to greet them. \"We have got about four ounces of dust,\" Dick said, \"and our backs are pretty nigh broken, and our hands that blistered we can hardly hold the shovel. However, we have been better the last two days. I expect there have been two or three hundred people arrived here since you left, and they are all at work now.\" \"Well, that\u0027s pretty well for a beginning,\" Abe said, \"though you wouldn\u0027t have much of your four ounces left if you had had to pay for grub. However, we\u0027ve brought up another half-sack of flour, twenty pounds of sugar, and five pounds of tea, and a half-side of bacon, so we have got quite enough to go on for a long time yet. I have brought up, too, a good stout tent, which will hold us comfortable, and, after paying for all that, here\u0027s thirty pounds in money. I got five pounds a horse-load, so with your earnings and ours we haven\u0027t made a bad week\u0027s work; that\u0027s pretty nigh ten pounds a man. I don\u0027t[237] say that\u0027s anything wonderful, as times goes here; but when we hit on a good spot for our digging, we shall pick it up quick. Now let\u0027s pitch the new tent, and then we will have supper, for I can tell you walking twenty-five miles in this mountain air gives one something like an appetite.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86714.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
