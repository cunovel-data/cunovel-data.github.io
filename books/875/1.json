{"id":27788,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. WESTMINSTER! WESTMINSTER!","content":"A CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of discontent or of shrinking sadness so often seen in the face of those afflicted. Had he been sitting on a chair at a table, indeed, he would have been remarked as a handsome and well-grown young fellow; his shoulders were broad, his arms powerful, and his head erect. He had not been born a cripple, but had been disabled for life, when a tiny child, by a cart passing over his legs above the knees. He was talking to a lad a year or so younger than himself, while a strong, hearty-looking woman, somewhat past middle age, stood at a wash-tub. \"What is all that noise about?\" the cripple exclaimed, as an uproar was heard in the street at some little distance from the house. \"Drink, as usual, I suppose,\" the woman said.[10] The younger lad ran to the door. \"No, mother; it\u0027s them scholars a-coming back from cricket. Ain\u0027t there a fight jist!\" The cripple wheeled his box to the door, and then taking a pair of crutches which rested in hooks at its side when not wanted, swung himself from the box, and propped himself in the doorway so as to command a view down the street. It was indeed a serious fight. A party of Westminster boys, on their way back from their cricket-ground in St. Vincent\u0027s Square, had been attacked by the \"skies.\" The quarrel was an old standing one, but had broken out afresh from a thrashing which one of the older lads had administered on the previous day to a young chimney-sweep about his own age, who had taken possession of the cricket-ball when it had been knocked into the roadway, and had, with much strong language, refused to throw it back when requested. The friends of the sweep determined to retaliate upon the following day, and gathered so threateningly round the gate that, instead of the boys coming home in twos and threes, as was their wont, when playtime expired, they returned in a body. They were some forty in number, and varied in age from the little fags of the Under School, ten or twelve years old, to brawny muscular young fellows of seventeen or eighteen, senior Queen\u0027s Scholars, or Sixth Form town boys. The Queen\u0027s Scholars were in their caps and gowns, the town boys were in ordinary attire, a few only having flannel cricketing trousers. On first leaving the field they were assailed only by volleys of abuse; but as they made their way down the street their assailants grew bolder, and from words[11] proceeded to blows, and soon a desperate fight was raging. In point of numbers the \"skies\" were vastly superior, and many of them were grown men; but the knowledge of boxing which almost every Westminster boy in those days possessed, and the activity and quickness of hitting of the boys, went far to equalise the odds. Pride in their school, too, would have rendered it impossible for any to show the white feather on such an occasion as this, and with the younger boys as far as possible in their centre, the seniors faced their opponents manfully. Even the lads of but thirteen and fourteen years old were not idle. Taking from the fags the bats which several of the latter were carrying, they joined in the conflict, not striking at their opponents\u0027 heads, but occasionally aiding their seniors, when attacked by three or four at once, by swinging blows on their assailant\u0027s shins. Man after man among the crowd had gone down before the blows straight from the shoulder of the boys, and many had retired from the contest with faces which would for many days bear marks of the fight; but their places were speedily filled up, and the numbers of the assailants grew stronger every minute. \"How well they fight!\" the cripple exclaimed. \"Splendid! isn\u0027t it, mother? But there are too many against them. Run, Evan, quick, down to Dean\u0027s Yard; you are sure to find some of them playing at racquets in the Little Yard, tell them that the boys coming home from cricket have been attacked, and that unless help comes they will be terribly knocked about.\" Evan dashed off at full speed. Dean\u0027s Yard was but a few minutes\u0027 run distant. He dashed through the little[12] archway into the yard, down the side, and then in at another archway into Little Dean\u0027s Yard, where some elder boys were playing at racquets. A fag was picking up the balls, and two or three others were standing at the top of the steps of the two boarding-houses. \"If you please, sir,\" Evan said, running up to one of the racquet-players, \"there is just a row going on; they are all pitching into the scholars on their way back from Vincent Square, and if you don\u0027t send help they will get it nicely, though they are all fighting like bricks.\" \"Here, all of you,\" the lad he addressed shouted to the others; \"our fellows are attacked by the \u0027skies\u0027 on their way back from fields. Run up College, James; the fellows from the water have come back.\" Then he turned to the boys on the steps, \"Bring all the fellows out quick; the \u0027skies\u0027 are attacking us on the way back from the fields. Don\u0027t let them wait a moment.\" It was lucky that the boys who had been on the water in the two eights, the six, and the fours, had returned, or at that hour there would have been few in the boarding-houses or up College. Ere a minute had elapsed these, with a few others who had been kept off field and water from indisposition, or other causes, came pouring out at the summons—a body some thirty strong, of whom fully half were big boys. They dashed out of the gate in a body, and made their way to the scene of the conflict. They were but just in time; the compact group of the boys had been broken up, and every one now was fighting for himself. They had made but little progress towards the school since Evan had started, and the fight was now raging opposite his house. The cripple was almost crying with[13] excitement and at his own inability to join in the fight going on. His sympathies were wholly with \"the boys,\" towards whose side he was attached by the disparity of their numbers compared to those of their opponents, and by the coolness and resolution with which they fought. \"Just look at those two, mother—those two fighting back to back. Isn\u0027t it grand! There! there is another one down; that is the fifth I have counted. Don\u0027t they fight cool and steady? and they almost look smiling, though the odds against them are ten to one. O mother, if I could but go to help them!\" Mrs. Holl herself was not without sharing his excitement. Several times she made sorties from her doorstep, and seized more than one hulking fellow in the act of pummelling a youngster half his size, and shook him with a vigour which showed that constant exercise at the wash-tub had strengthened her arms. \"Yer ought to be ashamed of yerselves, yer ought; a whole crowd of yer pitching into a handful o\u0027 boys.\" But her remonstrances were unheeded in the din,—which, however, was raised entirely by the assailants, the boys fighting silently, save when an occasional shout of \"Hurrah, Westminster!\" was raised. Presently Evan dashed through the crowd up to the door. \"Are they coming, Evan?\" the cripple asked eagerly. \"Yes, \u0027Arry; they will be \u0027ere in a jiffy.\" A half-minute later, and with shouts of \"Westminster! Westminster!\" the reinforcement came tearing up the street. Their arrival in an instant changed the face of things. The \"skies\" for a moment or two resisted; but the muscles of the eight—hardened by the training which[14] had lately given them victory over Eton in their annual race—stood them in good stead, and the hard hitting of the \"water\" soon beat back the lately triumphant assailants of \"cricket.\" The united band took the offensive, and in two or three minutes the \"skies\" were in full flight. \"We were just in time, Norris,\" one of the new-comers said to the tall lad in cricketing flannels whose straight hitting had particularly attracted the admiration of Harry Holl. \"Only just,\" the other said, smiling; \"it was a hot thing, and a pretty sight we shall look up School to-morrow. I shall have two thundering black eyes, and my mouth won\u0027t look pretty for a fortnight; and, by the look of them, most of the others have fared worse. It\u0027s the biggest fight we have had for years. But I don\u0027t think the \u0027skies\u0027 will interfere with us again for some time, for every mark we\u0027ve got they\u0027ve got ten. Won\u0027t there be a row in School to-morrow when Litter sees that half the Sixth can\u0027t see out of their eyes.\" Not for many years had the lessons at Westminster been so badly prepared as they were upon the following morning—indeed, with the exception of the half and home-boarders, few of whom had shared in the fight, not a single boy, from the Under School to the Sixth, had done an exercise or prepared a lesson. Study indeed had been out of the question, for all were too excited and too busy talking over the details of the battle to be able to give the slightest attention to their work. Many were the tales of feats of individual prowess; but all who had taken part agreed that none had so distinguished themselves as Frank Norris, a Sixth Form town boy, and captain of the eight—who, for a wonder had for[15] once been up at fields—and Fred Barkley, a senior in the Sixth. But, grievous and general as was the breakdown in lessons next day, no impositions were set; the boarding-house masters, Richards and Sargent, had of course heard all about it at tea-time, as had Johns, who did not himself keep a boarding-house, but resided at Carr\u0027s, the boarding-house down by the great gate. These, therefore, were prepared for the state of things, and contented themselves by ordering the forms under their charge to set to work with their dictionaries and write out the lessons they should have prepared. The Sixth did not get off so easily. Dr. Litter, in his lofty solitude as head-master, had heard nothing of what had passed; nor was it until the Sixth took their places in the library and began to construe that his attention was called to the fact that something unusual had happened. But the sudden hesitation and blundering of the first \"put on,\" and the inability of those next to him to correct him, were too marked to be passed over, and he raised his gold-rimmed eye-glasses to his eyes and looked round. Dr. Litter was a man standing some six feet two in height, stately in manner, somewhat sarcastic in speech,—a very prodigy in classical learning, and joint author of the great treatise On the Uses of the Greek Particle. Searchingly he looked from face to face round the library. \"I cannot,\" he said, with a curl of his upper lip, and the cold and somewhat nasal tone which set every nerve in a boy\u0027s body twitching when he heard it raised in reproof, \"I really cannot congratulate you on your appearance. I thought that the Sixth Form of Westminster was composed of gentlemen, but it seems to me now as if it consisted of a number of singularly disreputable-looking[16] prize-fighters. What does all this mean, Williams?\" he asked, addressing the captain; \"your face appears to have met with better usage than some of the others.\" \"It means, sir,\" Williams said, \"that as the party from fields were coming back yesterday evening, they were attacked by the \u0027skies,\u0027—I mean by the roughs—and got terribly knocked about. When the news came to us I was up College, and the fellows had just come back from the water, so of course we all sallied out to rescue them.\" \"Did it not occur to you, Williams, that there is a body called the police, whose duty it is to interfere in disgraceful uproars of this sort?\" \"If we had waited for the police, sir,\" Williams said, \"half the School would not have been fit to take their places in form again before the end of the term.\" \"It does not appear to me,\" Dr. Litter said, \"that a great many of them are fit to take their places at present. I can scarcely see Norris\u0027s eyes; and I suppose that boy is Barkley, as he sits in the place that he usually occupies, otherwise, I should not have recognised him; and Smart, Robertson, and Barker and Barret are nearly as bad. I suppose you feel satisfied with yourselves, boys, and consider that this sort of thing is creditable to you; to my mind it is simply disgraceful. There! I don\u0027t want to hear any more at present; I suppose the whole School is in the same state. Those of you who can see had better go back to School and prepare your Demosthenes; those who cannot had best go back to their boarding-houses, or up College, and let the doctor be sent for to see if anything can be done for you.\" The doctor had indeed already been sent for, for some[17] seven or eight of the younger boys had been so seriously knocked about and kicked that they were unable to leave their beds. For the rest a doctor could do nothing. Fights were not uncommon at Westminster in those days, but the number of orders for beef-steaks which the nearest butcher had received on the previous evening had fairly astonished him. Indeed, had it not been for the prompt application of these to their faces, very few of the party from the fields would have been able to find their way up School unless they had been led by their comrades. At Westminster there was an hour\u0027s school before breakfast, and when nine o\u0027clock struck, and the boys poured out, Dr. Litter and his under-masters held council together. \"This is a disgraceful business!\" Dr. Litter said, looking, as was his wont, at some distant object far over the heads of the others. There was a general murmur of assent. \"The boys do not seem to have been much to blame,\" Mr. Richards suggested in the cheerful tone habitual to him. \"From what I can hear it seems to have been a planned thing; the people gathered round the gates before they left the fields and attacked them without any provocation.\" \"There must have been some provocation somewhere, Mr. Richards, if not yesterday, then the day before, or the day before that,\" Dr. Litter said, twirling his eye-glass by the ribbon. \"A whole host of people do not gather to assault forty or fifty boys without provocation. This sort of thing must not occur again. I do not see that I can punish one boy without punishing the whole School;[18] but, at any rate, for the next week fields must be stopped. I shall write to the Commissioner of Police, asking that when they again go to Vincent Square some policemen may be put on duty, not of course to accompany them, but to interfere at once if they see any signs of a repetition of this business. I shall request that, should there be any fighting, those not belonging to the School who commit an assault may be taken before a magistrate; my own boys I can punish myself. Are any of the boys seriously injured, do you think?\" \"I hope not, sir,\" Mr. Richards said; \"there are three or four in my house, and there are ten at Mr. Sargent\u0027s, and two at Carr\u0027s, who have gone on the sick list. I sent for the doctor, and he may have seen them by this time; they all seemed to have been knocked down and kicked.\" \"There are four of the juniors at College in the infirmary,\" Mr. Wire, who was in special charge of the Queen\u0027s Scholars, put in. \"I had not heard about it last night, and was in ignorance of what had taken place until the list of those who had gone into the infirmary was put into my hands, and then I heard from Williams what had taken place.\" \"It is very unpleasant,\" Dr. Litter said, in a weary tone of voice—as if boys were a problem far more difficult to be mastered than any that the Greek authors afforded him—\"that one cannot trust boys to keep out of mischief for an hour. Of course with small boys this sort of thing is to be expected; but that young fellows like Williams and the other seniors, and the Sixth town boys, who are on the eve of going up to the Universities, should so far forget themselves is very surprising.\" \"But even at the University, Doctor Litter,\" Mr.[19] Richards said, with a passing thought of his own experience, \"town and gown rows take place.\" \"All the worse,\" Dr. Litter replied, \"all the worse. Of course there are wild young men at the Universities.\" Dr. Litter himself, it is scarcely necessary to say, had never been wild, the study of the Greek particles had absorbed all his thoughts. \"Why,\" he continued, \"young men should condescend to take part in disgraceful affrays of this kind passes my understanding. Mr. Wire, you will inform Williams that for the rest of the week no boy is to go to fields.\" So saying, he strode off in the direction of his own door, next to the archway, for the conversation had taken place at the foot of the steps leading into School from Little Dean\u0027s Yard. There was some grumbling when the head-master\u0027s decision was known; but it was, nevertheless, felt that it was a wise one, and that it was better to allow the feelings to calm down before again going through Westminster between Dean\u0027s Yard and the field, for not even the most daring would have cared for a repetition of the struggle. Several inquiries were made as to the lad who had brought the news of the fight, and so enabled the reinforcements to arrive in time; and had he been discovered a handsome subscription would have been got up to reward his timely service, but no one knew anything about him. The following week, when cricket was resumed, no molestation was offered. The better part of the working-classes who inhabited the neighbourhood were indeed strongly in favour of the \"boys,\" and liked to see their bright young faces as they passed home from their cricket;[20] the pluck too with which they had fought was highly appreciated, and so strong a feeling was expressed against the attack made upon them, that the rough element deemed it better to abstain from further interruption, especially as there were three or four extra police put upon the beat at the hours when the \"boys\" went to and from Vincent Square. It was, however, some time before the \"great fight\" ceased to be a subject of conversation among the boys. At five minutes to ten on the morning when Dr. Litter had put a stop to fields, two of the younger boys—who were as usual, just before school-time, standing in the archway leading into Little Dean\u0027s Yard to warn the School of the issuing out of the head-master—were talking of the fight of the evening before; both had been present, having been fagging out at cricket for their masters. \"I wonder which would lick, Norris or Barkley. What a splendid fight it would be!\" \"You will never see that, Fairlie, for they are cousins and great friends. It would be a big fight, and I expect it would be a draw. I know who I should shout for.\" \"Oh, of course, we should all be for Norris, he is such a jolly fellow; there is no one in the School I would so readily fag for. Instead of saying, \u0027Here, you fellow, come and pick up balls,\u0027 or, \u0027Take my bat up to fields,\u0027 he says, \u0027I say, young Fairlie, I wish you would come and pick up balls for a bit, and in a quarter of an hour you can call some other Under School boy to take your place,\u0027 just as if it were a favour, instead of his having the right to put one on if he pleased. I should like to be his fag: and he never allows any bullying up at Richards\u0027. I wish we had him at Sargent\u0027s.\"[21] \"Yes, and Barkley is quite a different sort of fellow. I don\u0027t know that he is a bully, but somehow he seems to have a disagreeable way with him, a cold, nasty, hard sort of way; he walks along as if he never noticed the existence of an Under School boy, while Norris always has a pleasant nod for a fellow.\" \"Here\u0027s Litter.\" At this moment a door in the wall under the archway opened, and the head-master appeared. As he came out the five or six small boys standing round raised a tremendous shout of \"Litter\u0027s coming.\" A shout so loud that it was heard not only in College and the boarding-houses in Little Dean\u0027s Yard, but at Carr\u0027s across by the archway, and even at Sutcliffe\u0027s shop outside the Yard, where some of the boys were purchasing sweets for consumption in school. A fag at the door of each of the boarding-houses took up the cry, and the boys at once came pouring out. The Doctor, as if unconscious of the din raised round him, walked slowly along half-way to the door of the School; here he was joined by the other masters, and they stood chatting in a group for about two minutes, giving ample time for the boys to go up School, though those from Carr\u0027s, having much further to go, had to run for it, and not unfrequently had to rush past the masters as the latter mounted the wide stone steps leading up to the School. The School was a great hall, which gave one the idea that it was almost coeval with the abbey to which it was attached, although it was not built until some hundreds of years later. The walls were massive, and of great height, and were covered from top to bottom with the painted names of old boys, some of which had been there,[22] as was shown by the dates under them, close upon a hundred years. The roof was supported on great beams, and both in its proportions and style the School was a copy in small of the great hall of Westminster. At the furthermost end from the door was a semicircular alcove, known as the \"Shell,\" which gave its name to the form sitting there. On both sides ran rows of benches and narrow desks, three deep, raised one above the other. On the left hand on entering was the Under School, and, standing on the floor in front of it, was the arm-chair of Mr. Wire. Next came the monitor\u0027s desk, at which the captain and two monitors sat. In an open drawer in front of the table were laid the rods, which were not unfrequently called into requisition. Extending up to the end were the seats of the Sixth. The \"Upper Shell\" occupied the alcove; the \"Under Shell\" were next to them, on the further benches on the right-hand side. Mr. Richards presided over the \"Shell.\" Mr. Sargent took the Upper and Under Fifth, who came next to them, and \"Johnny,\" as Mr. Johns was called, looked after the two Fourths, who occupied benches on the right hand of the door. By the time the masters entered the School all the boys were in their places. The doors were at once shut, then the masters knelt on one knee in a line, one behind the other, in order of seniority, and the Junior Queen\u0027s Scholar whose turn it was knelt in front of them, and in a loud tone read the Lord\u0027s Prayer in Latin. Then the masters proceeded to their places, and school began, the names of all who came in late being taken down to be punished with impositions. So large and lofty was the hall, that the voices were[23] lost in its space, and the forms were able to work without disturbing each other any more than if they had been in separate rooms. The Sixth only were heard apart, retiring into the library with the Doctor. His seat, when in school, was at a table in the centre of the hall, near the upper end. Thus Westminster differed widely from the great modern schools, with their separate class-rooms and lecture-rooms. Discipline was not very strict. When a master was hearing one of the forms under him the other was supposed to be preparing its next lessons, but a buzz of quiet talk went on steadily. Occasionally, once or twice a week perhaps, a boy would be seen to go up from one of the lower forms with a note in his hand to the head-master; then there was an instant pause in the talking. Dr. Litter would rise from his seat, and a monitor at once brought him a rod. These instruments of punishment were about three feet six inches long; they were formed of birch twigs, very tightly bound together, and about the thickness of the handle of a bat; beyond this handle some ten or twelve twigs extended for about eighteen inches. The Doctor seldom made any remark beyond giving the order, \"Hold out your hand.\" The unfortunate to be punished held out his arm at a level with his shoulder, back uppermost. Raising his arm so that the rod fell almost straight behind his back, Dr. Litter would bring it down, stroke after stroke, with a passionless and mechanical air, but with a sweeping force which did its work thoroughly. Four cuts was the normal number, but if it was the third time a boy had been sent up during the term he would get six. But four sufficed to swell the back of the hand, and cover it with narrow[24] weals and bruises. It was of course a point of honour that no sound should be uttered during punishment. When it was over the Doctor would throw the broken rod scornfully upon the ground and return to his seat. The Junior then carried it away and placed a fresh one upon the desk. The rods were treated with a sort of reverence, for no Junior Queen\u0027s Scholar ever went up or down school for any purpose without first going over to the monitor\u0027s table and lightly touching the rod as he passed. Such was school at Westminster forty years since, and it has but little changed to the present day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86702.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
