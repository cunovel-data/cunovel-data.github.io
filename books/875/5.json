{"id":27792,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. A TERRIBLE ACCUSATION.","content":"T WO days later, as Frank was about to start for the cricket-field, a small boy, whom he recognised as a son of Perkins, stopped him. \"Father wants to speak to you perticular, Mr. Norris.\" \"All right, young un, I will go round there at once.\" Wondering what Perkins could have to say to him, Frank took his way to the public-house. \"What is it, Perkins?\" he asked the prize-fighter as the latter let him into his private parlour. \"Well sir, there\u0027s a rumpus over this business as we had the other night.\" \"How a rumpus, Perkins?\" \"Well, sir, there was a tall red-haired chap—leastways I hear as he\u0027s tall and red-headed, and is a tailor by trade; his name is Suggs. It seems as how he got knocked down in the scrummage, and was so bad that the police, who came up after you left, took him to hospital; they brought him round all right, but it seems as how the bridge of his nose was broke, and it will be flat to his face for the rest of his life. Now I fancy that\u0027s a piece of your handiwork, Mr. Norris; I saw[76] jist such a chap as that go down when you hit him, and I thought to myself at the time what a onener it was.\" \"Yes, I did knock down just such a fellow,\" Frank said, \"and I am sorry I hit him so hard; I was afraid at the time that I hurt him.\" \"You should not let out from the shoulder in that sort of way, Mr. Norris,\" the pugilist said, shaking his head; \"you hit like the kick of a horse, and you never know what mayn\u0027t come of them sort of blows. No, sir; half-armed hitting is the thing for a general row; it hurts just as much, and is just as good for closing up an eye, but it don\u0027t do no general damage, so to speak. Now, sir, there\u0027s a row over the business. In course I holds my tongue; but they says as four of the party was young uns, and they guessed as they was gents. Now they puts things together, and have found out as I gives lessons to some of you Westminster gents, and they guesses as some of you was with me. Now, as I tells them, what can they do? They was the first to begin it, and we was only standing on self-defence, that\u0027s the way I puts it. No magistrate would look at the charge for a minute. It stands to reason that nine men did not attack four or five hundred. They must have been attacking us, that\u0027s clear to any one; and if it was me I should not care the snap of a finger about it—that\u0027s what I tells the red-haired tailor when he came here with two of his pals this morning. \u0027We has as much right to our opinions as you have; you attacks us,\u0027 says I, \u0027and we gives you pepper, that\u0027s all about it.\u0027 \u0027His beauty\u0027s spoilt for life,\u0027 says one of his mates. \u0027He never had no beauty to spoil,\u0027 says I, \u0027by the look of \u0027im,\u0027 so we got to words. \u0027They was Westminster boys,\u0027 says he.[77] \u0027That\u0027s all you knows about it,\u0027 says I. \u0027I will go to their masters,\u0027 says he, \u0027and report the case, and show him my nose,\u0027 says he. \u0027You have got no case to report,\u0027 says I, \u0027and no nose to show.\u0027 \u0027We will see about that,\u0027 says he; \u0027I ain\u0027t going to be made an object for the rest of my life for nothing.\u0027 \"So we goes on arguing; but at last he lets out that if I bring him a \u0027tenner\u0027 in the course of the week he will shut up. I ain\u0027t allowed of course, Mr. Norris, that any of you young gents had a hand in the fray, quite the contrary; but he has got it into his head that it is so, and he has made up his mind that he will go to the master. I don\u0027t think it likely that they could spot you, for they could hardly have got a fair look at your faces.\" \"No,\" Frank said, \"I don\u0027t suppose they would recognise any of us; but the first thing Litter would do would be to ask us if any of us were concerned in the affair. It\u0027s a beastly nuisance, for just now I happen to be completely cleaned out, and I am sure I do not know where I could get ten pounds from.\" \"If it had been any other time I could have helped you, Mr. Norris, but I paid my brewers only last night, and I ain\u0027t got two quid in the house; but I might manage to get it for you by the end of the week, if there ain\u0027t no other way. But my advice to you would be, let the red-haired man go to the master; if you keep your own counsel, no one can swear it out against you.\" \"No, I won\u0027t do that, Perkins,\" Frank said, \"it\u0027s known in the house; besides, if I am asked I must say it\u0027s me. Thank you for your offer. I will see you again in a day or two.\" Frank walked back to his boarding-house, moody[78] and dejected. Harris was in his room working. Frank told him what had happened. \"This is a bad business indeed,\" Harris said. \"By Jove! if it comes out, Litter would expel the four of us. What is to be done? I am sure I don\u0027t know.\" \"I don\u0027t see where I am to get ten pounds; I have only got fifteen shillings now.\" \"I have only seven and sixpence,\" Harris said. \"I have paid Shotten\u0027s bill for last term this week, and I know that Travers and James have not much more than I have. We might get something on our watches; but they are all silver, and I don\u0027t suppose we could get more than a pound apiece for them. But still that\u0027s something, and with our united silver would make up six pounds.\" \"I could get a pound or two from my cousin,\" Frank said; \"Fred always seems to be well supplied with money.\" \"Because he never spends any,\" Harris said. \"I am mistaken if Barkley will lend you anything.\" \"Oh, he will lend it if he\u0027s got it.\" But Harris turned out to be right. After the next school Frank laid the case before his cousin, who listened in silence to the story. \"I am very sorry, Frank,\" he said when he had finished, \"but I am entirely out of money at present.\" \"I thought you always had money,\" Frank said shortly. \"Not always,\" Fred replied quietly. \"As you know, I am fond of books, and last week I paid my bill for that edition of Shakespeare that you were admiring.\" Fred Barkley had indeed a library of books of which he was very proud, and which was worth more than all those belonging to the rest of the boys up College together.[79] Frank was too proud to suggest that his cousin could, if he chose, easily raise the amount required on a few of his favourites, and left the room without saying a word. Fred Barkley did not continue the work upon which he was engaged after his cousin had left the room, but sat looking fixedly at the papers before him. \"This is a grand opportunity,\" he muttered to himself, \"and I should be a fool if I let it slip. The question is, how is it best to be managed. I should be an idiot indeed if I cannot put a spoke into Master Frank\u0027s wheel somehow.\" The next day the Sixth Form, as usual, went into the library to do their construing. Dr. Litter, according to his usual custom, walked up and down hearing them and asking questions, the form sitting at their desks, which ran round the room. The Doctor was a fidgety man, and was always either twirling his watch-chain or eye-glass, or rattling the keys, knife, and other articles in his trousers pockets. Being perfectly conscious of the habit, he often emptied the contents of his pocket on to the table before starting to walk about the room, and this he did on the present occasion. As often happened, he was called from the room in the course of the lesson, and, ordering the boys to get up twenty additional lines of their Greek play in his absence, he left the room and did not return for half an hour. While he was away the boys moved freely about, some to consult each other\u0027s lexicons, others to chat. When Dr. Litter returned the lesson was finished, and the boys went back to the great schoolroom. On the following morning Frank Norris received a letter. On his opening it he found, to his astonishment, that[80] it contained only a bank-note for ten pounds, with the words \"From a friend.\" Frank was simply astounded. Who on earth could have sent him the exact sum of which he stood in need? He at once told his three friends what had occurred, and they were as much astonished as himself. All agreed that it was a perfect Godsend, though how any one could have got to know of his necessity for ten pounds at this special time none could imagine, as this was, as far as they were aware, known only to themselves and Fred Barkley. Frank at once concluded that his cousin must have sent him the money, and immediately sent up College and asked him to come to his room. Fred soon came up, and Frank at once proceeded to thank him for his gift. Fred, however, appeared as surprised as himself, and disclaimed any knowledge whatever of the note. \"I told you, Frank,\" he said reproachfully, \"that I had no money. Do you think that if I had it I would not have given it to you at once, instead of sending it in that roundabout manner? Do you know the handwriting? that may afford you some clue.\" \"No,\" Frank said; \"the name and address, as well as the words within, are done in printing characters, so that it is impossible to say who wrote them. Well, it is an extraordinary business, and I can only say that I am extremely thankful to the good fairy who has got me out of the scrape.\" Frank felt indeed relieved. He felt sure that the head-master would consider such an escapade by boys of the Sixth Form an unforgivable crime, and that expulsion would follow discovery; and knowing the hot temper of his uncle, he feared that the latter would view the matter[81] in the most serious light. It was therefore with a light heart that he went across to the Black Dog and placed the note in the hands of Perkins, merely saying that he was glad to say that he had been able to get the money to satisfy the red-haired tailor for his loss of beauty. \"It goes agin my heart to give it to him, Mr. Norris; but in course if you decide not to face it out there\u0027s nothing for it. I am glad you have got the money together.\" A week later one of the monitors informed Frank that the head-master wished to see him in the library. Wondering at this unusual order, Frank at once repaired there. Dr. Litter was sitting at his table, and he raised his eyes gravely as Frank entered. \"Norris,\" he said, \"I have been shocked at what has happened more than at anything which has occurred to me during my head-mastership of Westminster. I may tell you that everything is discovered. Now I leave it to you to make a full and frank confession.\" Frank was thunderstruck. So in some way his breaking out of bounds had become known to the headmaster. The tailor must have turned traitor and peached after having received his money. For a minute he stood silent and confounded, while Dr. Litter looked at him gravely. \"I acknowledge, sir,\" Frank began, \"that I broke out of bounds to go to a Chartist meeting, and that I got into a row there. I am very sorry now, but I really meant no harm by it; it was a foolish lark.\" \"And is that all you have to confess?\" Dr. Litter said quietly. \"Yes, sir,\" Frank said in surprise, \"I don\u0027t know that there\u0027s anything else for me to say.\"[82] \"You have not come to the most serious part of it yet,\" the Doctor said. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean, sir,\" Frank said, more and more astonished. \"You hurt him, and very seriously.\" \"Yes, sir, I broke a man\u0027s nose in the fight, but I did it in self-defence.\" \"And you paid him ten pounds to prevent his coming to me,\" the Doctor said. \"I acknowledge that I did so, but I don\u0027t see there was any harm in that.\" \"And where did you get the ten pounds from?\" the Doctor asked slowly. \"It was sent to me in an envelope,\" Frank replied. \"And who sent it to you?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" \"Norris,\" the Doctor said sternly, \"you stole that note from my table.\" Frank stepped back as if struck, the blood left his face, and he stood deadly pale. \"Stole it!\" he repeated, in a low, wondering tone. \"Yes,\" the Doctor repeated, \"stole it from my table when I left the room.\" \"It is a lie!\" Frank exclaimed, in a burst of passion; \"it is a lie, sir, whoever said it.\" Without replying to the outburst, the Doctor touched a bell which stood on the table, and a junior waiting outside entered. \"Tell Mr. Wire and Mr. Richards I wish to speak to them.\" Not a word was spoken in the library until the under-masters entered. A thousand thoughts passed rapidly[83] through Frank\u0027s brain. He was bewildered, and almost stupefied by this sudden charge, and yet he felt how difficult it would be to clear himself from it. The under-master and Frank\u0027s house-master entered. \"I have sent for you, gentlemen, on a most painful business,\" Dr. Litter said. \"I mentioned to you, Mr. Wire, a week since, that I had lost a ten-pound note. I placed it on the table here, during the morning lesson, with my keys and pencil. I was called out of the room for half an hour. When school was over I put the things back in my pocket, but it was not until the afternoon that I missed the note. Thinking it over, I could not recall taking it up with the other things from the table; but of this I could not be positively certain. As I told you, I could not for a moment believe that any of the boys of my form could have taken it, and I could only suppose that I had dropped it between the School and my house. \"As it happened, I had only got the note the day before from my bankers, and had therefore no difficulty in obtaining the number. I gave notice at the Bank of England at once that the note had been lost, and requested them to obtain the name and address of the presenter, should it be brought in. It was presented yesterday by a man who, after being questioned, said he was a tailor, living in Bermondsey. As I was determined to follow the matter up, I saw the Superintendent of Police, and a policeman was sent across to him. The man said that he had been seriously injured by one of my boys at a low meeting held at some place in the New Cut, and that the ten pounds had been given him as compensation, he having threatened to come and complain to me.[84] \"He was ignorant of the name of the boy, but he had received the note from a prize-fighter named Perkins, who keeps a low public-house down at Millbank. I sent a note to the man, requesting him to be good enough to call upon me this morning early. He did so. I told him that I had heard that he had paid to that man ten pounds as compensation for an injury which he had received from one of my boys, and I asked him from whom he had received it. \"He told me that nothing whatever would have induced him to tell; but as he knew the young gent would himself confess the instant the question was put, for he had told him he should do so did it come to my ears, there was no motive in his keeping silence, and it was Mr. Norris who had given it to him. On inquiry I find that the meeting in question was held between half-past nine and eleven; therefore, to have been present, Norris must have broken out of bounds and got into the boarding-house at night. \"This, in itself, would be a very grave offence, but it is as nothing by the side of the other. I am most reluctantly obliged to admit that I can come to but one conclusion: Norris, having broken bounds, and got into a disgraceful fray, was afraid that the matter would come to my ears. It was absolutely necessary for him to procure ten pounds to buy the silence of this man; my own very culpable carelessness, which I most deeply regret, left the note on the table, and the temptation was too much for him. \"I have questioned him how he got it. If he had said that he had picked it up in the yard, and, not knowing to whom it belonged, had very improperly,[85] without making inquiry, devoted it to the purpose of silencing this man, I should have gladly believed him—for hitherto he has stood high in my estimation, and I should certainly have considered him incapable of an act of theft. But he tells me that it was sent to him in an envelope, by whom he does not know; and this absurd story is, to my mind, a clear proof that he must have stolen it from the table.\" The two masters had at first looked at Frank with incredulous surprise, but as the narrative continued and the proofs appeared to accumulate, the expression changed, and they regarded him with horror, not unmixed with pity. For a minute there was silence, then Mr. Richards said:— \"Strong as the proofs seem to be, sir, I can hardly believe in the possibility of Norris having behaved in this way. He has always been a particularly straightforward, honest, and honourable lad; there is not a boy in the house of whom I would so absolutely have disbelieved this tale. That he did send this note to the man there can, by his own confession, be no doubt, but I still cannot believe that he stole it. Come now, Norris, you have got into a terrible scrape, but don\u0027t make matters worse; tell us frankly the truth about it.\" \"I have told the truth,\" Frank said, in a low and unnatural voice. \"I received the note in an envelope; here it is, sir, with, as you see, only the words \u0027From a friend.\u0027 I showed it when I had got it to Harris, Travers, James, and Barkley, and had not the remotest idea who it came from.\" \"To whom had you mentioned the need you had of ten pounds?\" Mr. Wire asked.[86] \"No one knew it except those four and Perkins, not a soul.\" The three masters looked even more grave. The four boys were sent for one by one, and were asked if they had mentioned to any one the need which Frank had of ten pounds; but all declared they had spoken to no one on the subject. \"He showed you the envelope containing the note he received; what did you think about it?\" \"It seemed a curious thing, sir,\" Harris said, \"but none of us could account for it.\" \"I am accused,\" Frank said, in a harsh voice, \"of having stolen that note from Dr. Litter\u0027s table.\" For the moment the four boys stood in silent astonishment. \"Nonsense, Frank,\" Harris burst out impetuously, \"we know you better than that, old fellow; if an angel from heaven came down and told me you were a thief I would not believe him,\" and Harris seized his friend\u0027s hand and wrung it warmly, an example followed by his three companions. Hitherto Frank\u0027s face had been hard and set, but he broke down now, and the tears streamed down his cheeks. \"You can go now,\" Dr. Litter said, and when the door closed upon them he continued: \"I would give much, very much, Norris, to be able to believe in your innocence; but I cannot see a possibility of it; the evidence to my mind is overwhelming. I acquit you of any idea of deliberate theft. You were pressed and afraid of exposure, and the temptation offered by the note was too strong for you; you thought you saw a way of escape, and to account[87] to your comrades for the possession of the money, you put it in an envelope and posted it, directed to yourself. Even now, if you will confess the truth, I will send you home privately, and avoid public expulsion and disgrace in consideration of the good character you have always hitherto borne; if not, I must at once lay the whole facts before your uncle and guardian, and to-morrow you will be publicly expelled.\" \"I have nothing to say, sir,\" Frank said quietly; \"overwhelming as the proof appears against me, I have spoken the simple truth, and I swear that I never saw that note until I took it from the envelope.\" \"Go to your room, sir!\" Dr. Litter said, with indignation, \"this continued denial is almost worse than the offence.\" Without a word Frank rose and left the library. \"This is indeed a shocking business,\" Mr. Wire said, as he followed Dr. Litter to the schoolroom. \"I cannot credit it,\" Mr. Richards put in; \"I know him so well, that, absolutely conclusive as I allow the evidence to be, I still hesitate to believe him to be guilty.\" After school was over Fred Barkley ran up to his cousin\u0027s room. \"My dear Frank,\" he exclaimed, \"we are ordered not to communicate with you, but I could not help running in to tell you that every one believes you to be innocent.\" \"I hardly know whether I believe it myself,\" Frank said bitterly. \"But you can do something for me, Fred; I have written a line to my uncle, will you post it for me at once?\" \"Certainly,\" Fred replied; \"but there is some one[88] coming upstairs, so I must be off.\" He took the letter and was gone. It contained only a few words:— \"My dear Uncle,—If you believe me innocent of this hideous charge, which I swear to you I am not guilty of, send me one line by hand when you get this. As long as I know that you have faith in me I can face it out.\" The afternoon passed slowly to the prisoner. His uncle would get the letter between three and four, and he might have an answer half an hour afterwards. Hour after hour passed, and, except the servant who brought up his tea, no one came near him. He reasoned to himself that his uncle might be out. At eight o\u0027clock he heard a noise on the stairs; a number of feet approached his room, and then the door opened, and the whole of the boys in the boarding-house poured in. \"Norris, old fellow,\" Harris said, \"we could stop away no longer, and in spite of orders we have come to see you. I beg to tell you in the name of the whole house, and I may say the whole School, that not a boy here believes you to be guilty. How the note came into your hands we don\u0027t know and we don\u0027t care, but we are certain you did not take it.\" \"No! no!\" was shouted in a chorus. \"So keep up your spirits, old fellow,\" Harris said, \"it will come right sooner or later.\" For some time Frank was unable to speak. \"Thank you all,\" he said at last, in a choking voice, \"it is a consolation to me indeed to know that my old friends still believe in me; but, till my innocence is proved, I shall never be able to look the world in the face again.\" \"Come, boys, this will not do,\" a voice at the door said;[89] \"Harris, you elder boys ought to set a better example to the younger ones. I told you that the Doctor\u0027s orders were positive that no one was to communicate with Norris.\" \"I can\u0027t help it, sir,\" Harris said; \"we all felt we couldn\u0027t go to bed to-night without telling Norris that we knew he was innocent.\" \"Well, well, you must go downstairs now,\"—not unkindly; \"you must not stay a minute longer.\" There was a chorus of \"Good night, Norris!\" \"Good night, old fellow!\" \"Keep up your pluck!\" and various other encouraging expressions, and the party filed out of the door; Mr. Richards waited to see the last out, and then left Frank to his thoughts. Not till ten o\u0027clock did Frank give up all hope of hearing from his uncle, then he felt he had been condemned. \"All my school-fellows acquit me, and my uncle, who should know me better than any of them, condemns me. I wonder what Alice said. I don\u0027t believe she would believe me guilty if all the world told her.\" At this moment the door opened quietly again, and Fred Barkley entered. Frank leapt to his feet to see if he was the bearer of a letter. Fred shook his head in answer to the unasked question. \"I have slipped out of College to see you, Frank, and Richards has given me leave to come up. I have no news, I only came to see what you were going to do.\" \"You posted the letter to my uncle, Fred?\" he asked. \"Yes, at once,\" he replied. Frank was silent. \"What do you mean to do?\" Fred went on. \"Do?\" Frank asked, \"what do you mean?\"[90] \"Why, I suppose you don\u0027t mean to stop here until to-morrow.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Frank replied, \"I had not thought about it.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t, if I were in your place. It would be a fearful business; there hasn\u0027t been a boy expelled from Westminster for the last thirty years. I shouldn\u0027t stop for it if I were you.\" \"But what am I to do? where am I to go?\" said Frank listlessly. \"Do?\" said Fred, \"why, go abroad to be sure. I should go out to California, or Australia, or somewhere, and in time this will be all forgotten. Perhaps it will turn out who sent that money. It is not as if facing it out would do any good, for you can prove nothing. Every one who knows you believes you innocent.\" \"Uncle Harry doesn\u0027t,\" Frank said bitterly, \"or he would have sent an answer to my letter.\" \"Ah! well, you know what he is,\" Fred said, \"how passionate and hasty he is; but after a time he will think as we all do, never fear. Look here, I thought that you would want some money, so have been round to Ginger\u0027s and have sold all my books. The old beggar would not give me more than twenty pounds for them, though I have paid him more than double that, besides what I have bought from others. However, here are the twenty pounds at your service, if you like to take them.\" Frank remained irresolute for a moment; then the thought of the terrible scene in the schoolroom, and of the tones in which the Doctor would pronounce his expulsion, overcame him. \"I may as well go before as after, for I could not go[91] home after that. Thank you, Fred, with all my heart; I will take your money and advice, and if I get a rich man I will pay you again. Are the fellows in bed?\" \"Yes,\" Fred replied, \"and Richards is in his study, so you can go down with me and slip out easy enough.\" \"Tell the others,\" Frank said, \"that I went because I could not face the scene to-morrow, and that I hope some day to return and prove my innocence.\" Without another word he opened his drawers, packed some clothes in a small portmanteau, put on his pea-jacket and the low cap he had worn in his unfortunate expedition to the New Cut; then he stole softly downstairs with Fred, and sallied out into the night air.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159/86706.html","bookId":875,"book":{"id":875,"title":"Captain Bayley\u0027s Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California","description":"简介： CRIPPLE boy was sitting in a box on four low wheels, in a little room in a small street in Westminster; his age was some fifteen or sixteen years; his face was clear-cut and intelligent, and was altogether free from the expression either of disconten...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3159","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:39 AM"}}
