Ellen giggled. \"A little girl wouldn\u0027t go to a ball. Let\u0027s make them go someplace else. Let\u0027s make them go to Tivoli!\" \"Tivoli!\" Annemarie began to laugh. \"That\u0027s in Copenhagen! Gone With the Wind is in America!\" \"Tivoli, Tivoli, Tivoli,\" little Kirsti sang, twirling her doll in a circle. \"It doesn\u0027t matter, because it\u0027s only a game anyway,\" Ellen pointed out. \"Tivoli can be over there, by that chair. \u0027Come, Scarlett,\u0027\" she said, using her doll voice, \"\u0027we shall go to Tivoli to dance and watch the fireworks, and maybe there will be some handsome men there! Bring your silly daughter Bonnie, and she can ride on the carousel.\u0027\" Annemarie grinned and walked her Scarlett toward the chair that Ellen had designated as Tivoli. She loved Tivoli Gardens, in the heart of Copenhagen; her parents had taken her there, often, when she was a little girl. She remembered the music and the brightly colored lights, the carousel and ice cream and especially the magnificent fireworks in the evenings: the huge colored splashes and bursts of lights in the evening sky. \"I remember the fireworks best of all,\" she commented to Ellen. \"Me too,\" Kirsti said. \"I remember the fireworks.\" \"Silly,\" Annemarie scoffed. \"You never saw the fireworks.\" Tivoli Gardens was closed now. The German occupation forces had burned part of it, perhaps as a way of punishing the fun-loving Danes for their lighthearted pleasures. Kirsti drew herself up, her small shoulders stiff. \"I did too,\" she said belligerently. \"It was my birthday. I woke up in the night and I could hear the booms. And there were lights in the sky. Mama said it was fireworks for my birthday!\" Then Annemarie remembered. Kirsti\u0027s birthday was late in August. And that night, only a month before, she, too, had been awakened and frightened by the sound of explosions. Kirsti was right—the sky in the southeast had been ablaze, and Mama had comforted her by calling it a birthday celebration. \"Imagine, such fireworks for a little girl five years old!\" Mama had said, sitting on their bed, holding the dark curtain aside to look through the window at the lighted sky. The next evening\u0027s newspaper had told the sad truth. The Danes had destroyed their own naval fleet, blowing up the vessels one by one, as the Germans approached to take over the ships for their own use. \"How sad the king must be,\" Annemarie had heard Mama say to Papa when they read the news. \"How proud,\" Papa had replied. It had made Annemarie feel sad and proud, too, to picture the tall, aging king, perhaps with tears in his blue eyes, as he looked at the remains of his small navy, which now lay submerged and broken in the harbor. \"I don\u0027t want to play anymore, Ellen,\" she said suddenly, and put her paper doll on the table. \"I have to go home, anyway,\" Ellen said. \"I have to help Mama with the housecleaning. Thursday is our New Year. Did you know that?\" \"Why is it yours?\" asked Kirsti. \"Isn\u0027t it our New Year, too?\" \"No. It\u0027s the Jewish New Year. That\u0027s just for us. But if you want, Kirsti, you can come that night and watch Mama light the candles.\" Annemarie and Kirsti had often been invited to watch Mrs. Rosen light the Sabbath candles on Friday evenings, She covered her head with a cloth and said a special prayer in Hebrew as she did so. Annemarie always stood very quietly, awed, to watch; even Kirsti, usually such a chatterbox, was always still at that time. They didn\u0027t understand the words or the meaning, but they could feel what a special time it was for the Rosens. \"Yes,\" Kirsti agreed happily. \"I\u0027ll come and watch your mama light the candles, and i\u0027ll wear my new black shoes,\" But this time was to be different. Leaving for school on Thursday with her sister, Annemarie saw the Rosens walking to the synagogue early in the morning, dressed in their best clothes. She waved to Ellen, who waved happily back. \"Lucky Ellen,\" Annemarie said to Kirsti. \"She doesn\u0027t have to go to school today.\" \"But she probably has to sit very, very still, like we do in church,\" Kirsti pointed out. \"That\u0027s no fun.\" That afternoon, Mrs. Rosen knocked at their door but didn\u0027t come inside. Instead, she spoke for a long time in a hurried, tense voice to Annemarie\u0027s mother in the hall. When Mama returned, her face was worried, but her voice was cheerful. \"Girls,\" she said, \"we have a nice surprise. Tonight Ellen will be coming to stay overnight and to be our guest for a few days! It isn\u0027t often we have a visitor.\" Kirsti clapped her hands in delight. \"But, Mama,\" Annemarie said, in dismay, \"it\u0027s their New Year. They were going to have a celebration at home! Ellen told me that her mother managed to get a chicken someplace, and she was going to roast it—their first roast chicken in a year or more!\" \"Their plans have changed,\" Mama said briskly. \"Mr. and Mrs. Rosen have been called away to visit some relatives. So Ellen will stay with us. Now, let\u0027s get busy and put clean sheets on your bed. Kirsti, you may sleep with Mama and Papa tonight, and we\u0027ll let the big girls giggle together by themselves.\" Kirsti pouted, and it was clear that she was about to argue. \"Mama will tell you a special story tonight,\" her mother said. \"One just for you.\" \"About a king?\" Kirsti asked dubiously. \"About a king, if you wish,\" Mama replied. \"All right, then. But there must be a queen, too,\" Kirsti said. Though Mrs. Rosen had sent her chicken to the Johansens, and Mama made a lovely dinner large enough for second helpings all around, it was not an evening of laughter and talk. Ellen was silent at dinner. She looked frightened. Mama and Papa tried to speak of cheerful things, but it was clear that they were worried, and it made Annemarie worry, too. Only Kirsti was unaware of the quiet tension in the room. Swinging her feet in their newly blackened and shiny shoes, she chattered and giggled during dinner. \"Early bedtime tonight, little one,\" Mama announced after the dishes were washed. \"We need extra time for the long story I promised, about the king and queen.\" She disappeared with Kirsti into the bedroom. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Annemarie asked when she and Ellen were alone with Papa in the living room. \"Something\u0027s wrong. What is it?\" Papa\u0027s face was troubled. \"I wish that I could protect you children from this knowledge,\" he said quietly. \"Ellen, you already know. Now we must tell Annemarie.\" He turned to her and stroked her hair with his gentle hand. \"This morning, at the synagogue, the rabbi told his congregation that the Nazis have taken the synagogue lists of all the Jews. Where they live, what their names are. Of course the Rosens were on that list, along with many others.\" \"Why? Why did they want those names?\" \"They plan to arrest all the Danish Jews. They plan to take them away. And we have been told that they may come tonight.\" \"I don\u0027t understand! Take them where?\" Her father shook his head. \"We don\u0027t know where, and we don\u0027t really know why. They call it \u0027relocation.\u0027 We don\u0027t even know what that means. We only know that it is wrong, and it is dangerous, and we must help.\" Annemarie was stunned. She looked at Ellen and saw that her best friend was crying silently. \"Where are Ellen\u0027s parents? We must help them, too!\" \"We couldn\u0027t take all three of them. If the Germans came to search our apartment, it would be clear that the Rosens were here. One person we can hide. Not three. So Peter has helped Ellen\u0027s parents to go elsewhere. We don\u0027t know where. Ellen doesn\u0027t know either. But they are safe.\" Ellen sobbed aloud, and put her face in her hands. Papa put his arm around her. \"They are safe, Ellen. I promise you that. You will see them again quite soon. Can you try hard to believe my promise?\" Ellen hesitated, nodded, and wiped her eyes with her hand. \"But, Papa,\" Annemarie said, looking around the small apartment, with its few pieces of furniture: the fat stuffed sofa, the table and chairs, the small bookcase against the wall. \"You said that we would hide her. How can we do that? Where can she hide?\" Papa smiled. \"That part is easy. It will be as your mama said: you two will sleep together in your bed, and you may giggle and talk and tell secrets to each other. And if anyone comes—\" Ellen interrupted him. \"Who might come? Will it be soldiers? Like the ones on the corners?\" Annemarie remembered how terrified Ellen had looked the day when the soldier had questioned them on the corner. \"I really don\u0027t think anyone will. But it never hurts to be prepared. If anyone should come, even soldiers, you two will be sisters. You are together so much, it will be easy for you to pretend that you are sisters.\" He rose and walked to the window. He pulled the lace curtain aside and looked down into the street. Outside, it was beginning to grow dark. Soon they would have to draw the black curtains that all Danes had on their windows; the entire city had to be completely darkened at night. In a nearby tree, a bird was singing; otherwise it was quiet. It was the last night of September. \"Go, now, and get into your nightgowns. It will be a long night.\" Annemarie and Ellen got to their feet. Papa suddenly crossed the room and put his arms around them both. He kissed the top of each head: Annemarie\u0027s blond one, which reached to his shoulder, and Ellen\u0027s dark hair, the thick curls braided as always into pigtails. \"Don\u0027t be frightened,\" he said to them softly. \"Once I had three daughters. Tonight I am proud to have three daughters again.\" 5. Who Is the Dark-Haired One? \"Do you really think anyone will come?\" Ellen asked nervously, turning to Annemarie in the bedroom. \"Your father doesn\u0027t think so.\" \"Of course not. They\u0027re always threatening stuff. They just like to scare people.\" Annemarie took her nightgown from a hook in the closet. \"Anyway, if they did, it would give me a chance to practice acting. I\u0027d just pretend to be Lise. I wish I were taller, though.\" Ellen stood on tiptoe, trying to make herself tall. She laughed at herself, and her voice was more relaxed. \"You were great as the Dark Queen in the school play last year,\" Annemarie told her. \"You should be an actress when you grow up.\" \"My father wants me to be a teacher.He wants everyone to be a teacher, like him. But maybe I could convince him that I should go to acting school.\" Ellen stood on tiptoe again, and made an imperious gesture with her arm. \"I am the Dark Queen,\" she intoned dramatically. \"I have come to command the night!\" \"You should try saying, \u0027I am Lise Johansen!\u0027\" Annemarie said, grinning. \"If you told the Nazis that you were the Dark Queen, they\u0027d haul you off to a mental institution.\" Ellen dropped her actress pose and sat down, with her legs curled under her, on the bed. \"They won\u0027t really come here, do you think?\" she asked again. Annemarie shook her head. \"Not in a million years.\" She picked up her hairbrush. The girls found themselves whispering as they got ready for bed. There was no need, really, to whisper; they were, after all, supposed to be normal sisters, and Papa had said they could giggle and talk. The bedroom door was closed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/number-the-stars/page-4.html","bookId":2707,"book":{"id":2707,"title":"Number the Stars","description":"Storyline: Ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen and her best friend Ellen Rosen often think of life before the war.
