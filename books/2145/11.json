{"id":96116,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"What do I wear to meet parents?\" I asked Becky in my bedroom later that day. \"I don\u0027t have a thing! It\u0027s way different than trying to impress a guy. It has to be something striking yet appropriate.\"\\n\\n \"Hello! You have a whole wardrobe that screamsmansionwear !\"\\n\\n \"Really?You say the kindest things!\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n Becky was stretched out on my bed reading one of her teenmags while I mixed and matched several outfits and modeled them.\\n\\n \"They all look good to me.\"\\n\\n \"But I have to look great! This one is too sexy,\" I said, holding a black bodice. \"And this one is too casual,\" I said, holding up a HIM T-shirt. \"How am I going to pull it off? This could make or break my relationship with Alexander.\"\\n\\n \"Thismag is full of great styles.\" Becky opened to a spread.\\n\\n \"For me?Are the girls modeling tattoos and tongue piercings?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so. But that doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t help inspire you.\"\\n\\n \"Alexander would drop dead if I showed up in a polka-dotted dress.\"\\n\\n \"Just give it your spin. If they\u0027re showing stripedKeds sneakers-then choose skull and crossbones Vans \"\\n\\n It was great to have a best friend who understood me.\\n\\n But the models were beautiful and glowing in their candy-colored outfits. I guess I couldn\u0027t hide my slight jealousy of their perfect bodies.\\n\\n \"Hey, everyone can be gorgeous with airbrushing,\" Becky remarked. \"And we are fabulous without it!\"\\n\\n \"You really expect me to put my hair in a ponytail with plaid ribbon?\"\\n\\n \"No. You\u0027d wear pigtails with an uneven part and black lace bows. Or better yet, Wednesday Addams braids.\"\\n\\n \"You are onto something. Maybe we could start our own magazine.Something where the models dress like me.Gothicgirl!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d buy it, I\u0027d totally not wear anything in it, but I\u0027d buy it,\" Becky assured me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be the editor, and we could have articles about music and fashion and we\u0027d interviewCriss Angel,\" I said excitedly. \"And in every issue I could be on the cover-like Oprah, but wearing all black.\"\\n\\n \"And Alexander, too,\" Becky added. \"I bet every girl across the country would buy a copy.\"\\n\\n \"But he couldn\u0027t be on the cover.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Uh...\" I almost blurted out the true reason, but I caught myself.\"Because it\u0027s my magazine. Not his. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,He\u0027ll have to get his own.How aboutGQ.Gothic Quarterly\" I said, covering my tracks.\\n\\n \"Awesome! Now that we\u0027ve decided on your career, we need to pick your outfit.\"\\n\\n We matched a few outfits together and voted on them until only one was left.A black mini lace dress, black tights with knee-high boots, and a lace bodice.\\n\\n \"A marriage made in heaven-or in my case, hell.\"\\n\\n We both laughed.\\n\\n \"Well, what do you think?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Drop- dead gorgeous!\"\\n\\n The first time I had a dinner date with Alexander I was nervous. Would he like me? Would he ask me out again? Would it end in a passionate kiss?\\n\\n This dinner would be different. I brushed my hair a thousand times and reapplied my makeup. Was I too pale or not pale enough?\\n\\n On this date I\u0027d be judged by Alexander\u0027s parents. Would theSterlings think I was a good fit for their son? I knew they had approved of Luna-but I wasn\u0027t Luna. I didn\u0027t come fromRomania or have vampire blood or a vampire family. My whole relationship was riding on this one meal.\\n\\n I was getting ready when my mom poked her head into my room.\\n\\n \"So, are you excited about your big night?\" my mom asked.\\n\\n I tried to downplay its importance and hide the panic attack I was having. \"Sure, it\u0027s no big deal.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it is. You are going to meet your boyfriend\u0027s parents!\"\\n\\n \"You are supposed to make me feel better-not worse!\" I whined.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I meant. I meant it is exciting.\"\\n\\n I felt tears welling. Any minute my eyeliner was going to bleed down to my shoes.\\n\\n \"No- it\u0027s a make-it-or-break-it night. I\u0027m not like them.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you have to be like them? You are you.\" My mom smiled.\\n\\n \"TheSterlings have royal blood. Alexander\u0027s grandmother was a baroness. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve dined with kings, queens, and noblemen. They live in mansions! They are fromRomania . I\u0027m from Dullsville.\" I plopped down on my bed.\\n\\n \"Just relax.\"\\n\\n \"How can I relax? You have no idea what it\u0027s like.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think I do?\" she asked, sitting down next to me. \"Your father and I were both hippies, remember? Our parents were ultraconservative. When I first met Grandma Madison, I was in a tank top and cutoffs. I\u0027m surprised she ever let me in her house again.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s normal to be nervous. Think of how Alexander feels. He wants you to like them, too,\"\\n\\n \"You think he\u0027s anxious, too?\"\\n\\n \"Of course he is. He probably thinks his parents will embarrass him, just like you think we will.\"\\n\\n I felt relieved knowing that I wasn\u0027t carrying the entire burden of our meeting.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure as soon as theSterlings meet you,\" my mom continued, \"they\u0027lllove you like I do.\"\\n\\n \"You have to love me; you\u0027re my mother,\" I rolled my eyes.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see what you chose to wear.\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? Becky and I already decided on it. I can\u0027t go back now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you chose something appropriate. I\u0027ll go downstairs until you\u0027re ready,\"\\n\\n I retouched,rebrushed , and fussed until my EdwardScissorhands clock flashed, \"You\u0027re late!\"\\n\\n I flew down the stairs to find my family hanging out in front of the TV. I modeled my outfit.\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t you wear somethingmore.,.conservative ?\" my mother asked. \"How about a pretty knit sweater?\"\\n\\n I ignored my mother\u0027s remarks.\\n\\n \"You look wonderful,\" my dad said.\\n\\n \"I think she looks awesome,\" I heard Henry say to Billy Boy.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027m going to hurl,\" my brother retorted.\\n\\n I hugged my parents exceptionally hard. I was going to be dining with adult vampires. Who knows-I might lever come back.\\n\\n A few minutes later our doorbell rang.\\n\\n I was too nervous to answer, so Billy Boy opened the door.\\n\\n \"One moment,\" he said in his politest voice. \"Raven- it\u0027s for you.\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath and started for the door. Jameson stood before me, complete in his butler\u0027s uniform and gloves. \"Miss Raven, your car awaits you.\"\\n\\n My mom winked and my dad gave me a thumbs-up.\\n\\n As Jameson and I walked down the driveway, I glanced back. Billy Boy and Henry were spying through the front window. Then two more heads popped into view-former hippies Paul and Sarah Madison.\\n\\n Jameson led me to the parked Mercedes and kindly opened the back door.\\n\\n My parents were impressed with my chauffeur and gothic limo service, even if the chauffeur was unusually creepy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-11.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \\n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
