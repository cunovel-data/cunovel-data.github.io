{"id":96113,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"With the promise of a piping-hot Hatsy\u0027sburger and atomic fries, I bribed Becky into driving me to the Emerson building on our way home from school. It was like me to snoop, so I took advantage of my true nature. Of course, Becky was horrified with the whole idea and decided to wait in the car.\\n\\n \"I need your help,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You do so well on your own.\"\\n\\n \"We can cover more terrain with two people. I want to know what they might have come here for.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that spying? Maybe Alexander\u0027s father was getting a haircut. Why would that be such a big deal?\"\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t be if they weren\u0027t vampires,I wanted to say. \"Nothing about them is usual\"\\n\\n Becky put the truck in park.\\n\\n \"Fine, I\u0027ll go myself. But leave the truck running in case I need a quick getaway.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" she said, hopping out of the truck. \"I\u0027d better keep my eye on you.\"\\n\\n \"Works every time,\" I mumbled.\\n\\n The Emerson building was like any other upscale office center. The blue and white glass structure was box-shaped. A three-tiered fountain highlighted the center of the building, and itsMasonite floors sparkled as if they\u0027d just been waxed.\\n\\n Becky appeared to be intimidated by what she thought was a security guard ready to arrest all teen loiterers.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an info desk,\" I said. \"Chill out\"\\n\\n I made my way to the elevators and scanned the alphabetized list of tenants hanging on the wall.\\n\\n \"Now we have to see which one they went into,\"\\n\\n \"I thought you just wanted to know what was in the building.\"\\n\\n I ignored Becky\u0027s comment. \"They visited at night, so that should eliminate some of these.\"\\n\\n I dragged Becky into the male-only hair salon.\\n\\n \"We only do men\u0027s hair,\" theoverdyed red-haired receptionist said before I asked her a question.\\n\\n \"I know. Did a couple come in last night?\"\\n\\n \"A male couple?\"\\n\\n \"No, a man and a woman.They\u0027re fromRomania .\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Well, thanks for your help,\" I said.\"One down, five hundred to go.\"\\n\\n We opened the glass doors to a Younger You cosmetic surgery office.\\n\\n \"Do you remember seeing a couple here yesterday?\" I asked the receptionist, who could have doubled as a nurse.\\n\\n \"Our client list is confidential\"\\n\\n \" Iunderstand you can\u0027t tell me who visited your office, but you surely can tell me who didn\u0027t. So can you confirm that a man and woman fromRomaniadidn\u0027t visit this office yesterday?\"\\n\\n She rolled her eyes. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they did?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Becky was getting fed up. Not with the office workers - but with me.\\n\\n \"How about I wait here?\" she asked, pointing to the fountain.\\n\\n \"Just stay with me. I won\u0027t appear to be such a crackpot you\u0027re by my side,\" I begged her.\\n\\n We got in the elevator and made our way floor by floor, office by office. \"Did a couple come in here last evening dressed like me?\" I\u0027d ask, and each receptionist would gawk at me and respond similarly, \"No. I think I\u0027d remember.\"\\n\\n The last office was Berkley Realtors.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m tired. Please, let\u0027s go home\" Becky pleaded.\\n\\n \"But we only have one more togo \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving,\" Becky said, exhausted.\\n\\n My feet hurt, too. And who knew, maybe one of these receptionists we spoke with wasn\u0027t working yesterday.\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said, guiding my weary friend into the elevator. \"Enough parent hunting for today...\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow,\" Becky said as the elevator doors closed, \"you can take the bus.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-8.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \\n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
