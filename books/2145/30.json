Matt and Trevor and all the other jocks were off preparing for a pep rally, so I wasn\u0027t going to have to face Trevor. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that madeschool exciting.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hoping you can give the papers to your partners,\" Mrs.Naper said to us.\\n\\n \"I sure will,\" Becky said, excited. \"We got an A.\"\\n\\n \"No surprise,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What did you get?\" Becky asked.\\n\\n I opened Trevor\u0027sDullsvilleHigh School folder and saw the scarlet A next to his name. \"Well, Trevor got an A of course.\" I designed my folder like it was the cover of a gothic magazine, complete with pasted headlines, gothic fashions, and teasers. I opened it and hoped for a good letter in the alphabet. \"So didI !\"\\n\\n After school, I biked over to Oakley Woods.\\n\\n Mrs. Mitchell answered the door. \"Hello, Raven.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Mrs. Mitchell.Is-\"\\n\\n \"It was quite a surprise to learn that the European artist was actually Alexander.\"\\n\\n I waited. Maybe we had embarrassed her at the auction. It was as if at any moment the Wicked Witch of the West would point her broom at me.\\n\\n \"I must say your boyfriend is truly talented. What a wonderful surprise to know that we had such a fine artist among us. It\u0027s a shame he\u0027ll be moving. We\u0027d love to have his work in the auction next year.\"\\n\\n \"Uh... thanks, Mrs. Mitchell,\" I said, relieved. \"Is Trevor home? We got our grades back from our English assignment.\"\\n\\n \"Come on in. Trevor\u0027s upstairs.\"\\n\\n I quickly raced up the main staircase and found Trevor\u0027s bedroom door ajar.\\n\\n I tapped it. \"Hello.Soccer Boy?\"\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n I could have waited in the hallway, but that wouldn\u0027t have been any fun at all.\\n\\n Trevor\u0027s room was still a shrine to himself. I nosed around his awards and trophies and framed soccer jerseys.\\n\\n I noticed something large was covered in the corner. Maybe it was a mirror.\\n\\n I snuck over to it and pulled back the cloth so I could take a peek.\\n\\n Staring back at me was me -the final painting of Alexander\u0027s sold at the auction. I was shocked.\\n\\n I heard the door begin to creak open and quickly recovered the painting.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" Trevor asked.\\n\\n \"Uh... I wanted to tell you we got an A.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\u0027\\n\\n \"I just thought you\u0027d like to know.\"\\n\\n \"What else would we have gotten? You\u0027re not used to getting good grades.\"\\n\\n I had done my duty and there was nothing left to say. I started for the door when he blocked my escape.\\n\\n I was alone with Trevor in his room-a dangerous place to be.\\n\\n \"Anything else you\u0027d like to do?\" he asked.\\n\\n I wanted to say,Get that picture back, but I sensed Trevor wanted a stolen kiss-a treasure that was far more valuable than an A..\\n\\n I\u0027d never let myself succumb to that. Even if I wasn\u0027t dating Alexander, nothing would ever be sacred or special with Trevor.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t mention seeing the painting. I was too touched and slightly bothered that he\u0027d spent his money on a picture of me. It was ironic that Trevor would be the one to help Alexander buy back the Mansion and divert his father from his plans.\\n\\n It would be awesome to throw it in his face. But I didn\u0027t dare do that to my partner.\\n\\n I offered my hand instead. I figured I was safe with that.\\n\\n He held it like he didn\u0027t want to let it go.\\n\\n His golden hair was perfect against his suntanned face. I knew he wanted to kiss me-and I wasn\u0027t sure whether it was love or lust or just because I was a girl alone in his room.\\n\\n \"I know there\u0027s a part of you that wonders what it would be like,\" Trevor said.\\n\\n \"I already know,\" I said. \"The cheerleaders have it written on the bathroom walls.\"\\n\\n I withdrew my hand and left his room before he tried to hold any other part of me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-30.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \\n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
