I was racked with pain and torment.\n \"So, what did Alexander have to say?\" my mom asked. \"Are they staying in town?\"\n I shook my head.\n \"You must be devastated.\"\n \"I am!\"\n Tears began to roll down my already-soaked cheeks.\n \"We were so taken with his parents, too. We were hoping to spend more time with them. I\u0027m so sorry, honey.\n I could barely speak.\n \"I thought they liked it here, but I must say that I can imagine it would be difficult for them,\" my mom said.\n \"Why, because she wears a corset?And uses an umbrella to block the moonlight?\" I asked.\n \"You gripe about how conservative this town is,\" my mom said. \"They might be seeking someplace more cosmopolitan.\"\n \"What are the chances-if Alexander does move that I could go with him?\" I asked my dad.\n \"Zero,\" he answered.\n \"Honey,\" my mom said softly, \"I know he is your first love.\"\n \"He\u0027s my only love!\"\n \"I know,\" she continued, \"but you are only sixteen.\"\n \"I\u0027m almost seventeen. Juliet was married at that age!\"\n \"And look what happened toher \" my dad said.\n \"This isn\u0027t funny! If Alexander moves, my life is over- pure and simple. I\u0027ll never wake up again.\" I burst into tears.\n My mom hugged me like I was a child.\n \"Why can\u0027t theSterlings like it here?\" I sobbed. \"Why do they have to go back toRomania ?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they have family there,\" my mom said, brushing my hair away from my tearstained face. \"That is their home.\"\n \"But this is Alexander\u0027s home. If we buy it-then Alexander can live there. He\u0027s almost eighteen, you know.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure we can afford two homes.\"\n \"But can\u0027t you try? Use my college money. I\u0027ll get a job.\"\n \"Now you are thinking.\" My dad smiled.\n \"I mean it,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll do it.\" But then I calculated the wages I\u0027d made when I worked at Armstrong Travel. \"It would take me years working part-time to earn enough for \u0027Jill a house,\" I said, frustrated. \"By then I\u0027ll be buying into a retirement community.\"\n \"When your mother went back home at the beginning of college summer break/\u0027 my dad said, \"I was so lonely. I wrote her letters every day and called her. That was long before the Internet and cell phones.\"\n \"An e- mail is not going to replace Alexander,\" I said, and stormed off to my bedroom. \"Nothing will.\"\n This was one time there was nothing my parents could say that would comfort me.\n By the following day the news that theBensonHillMansion was for sale had swept through Dullsville like a tornado. However, the only damage it was causing was to my heart.\n \"What are you going to do?\" Becky asked at my house the next morning as I was still lying in bed. \"Is Alexander moving, too? Where is he going to live?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Well, get up. We\u0027re going to be late. I mean, later than usual.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want him to move. I\u0027d die.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want him to move and he\u0027s not even my boy friend. He\u0027s so perfect for you. And I\u0027d hate to see you without your true love.\"\n \"This is, like, the worst news ever!\" I cried out. It was true-there was no way around it. My world was crashing around me. \"I can\u0027t go to school today!\"\n Becky tugged at my shirt. \"You have to go. I\u0027m not going to let you stay here and sulk. School will get your mind off of it.\"\n After splashing cold water on my face and promising to help solve my problem, Becky was successful at dragging me to school. But when we arrived I was far from distracted.\n \"The Mansion\u0027s for sale and Alexander has to move back toRomania ,\" Becky said as soon as she saw Matt.\n \"My parents told me last night when I got home. That totally sucks, Raven. Word has it that they are selling it and are going to build a house next to the cemetery\" he said.\n Word has it? It was just announced in the paper yesterday morning. \"Who did you hear that from-Trevor? \"\n \"How did you know?\" Matt asked, like I was clairvoyant.\n Even Trevor\u0027s scenario was better than the reality. At least Alexander would remain in Dullsville.\n I was as miserably morbid as my black attire. I spent the day daydreaming about a life inRomania with theSterlings .The four of us as vampires, without any downside.A life of eternal love and beauty and moonlight.\n Before class I was at the vending machine buying a soda.\n \"Finally that horrible mansion is for sale,\" I overheard aPradabee say. \"Hopefully they\u0027ll burn it down and put up a shopping mall.\"\n \"So you finally scared him away\" Trevor said at my locker before English class. \"I guess when his parents sawyou, they had to pack their coffins.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you even start withme. Not today.\"\n \"Well, when then? When will we start our essays?\" he asked.\n \"I have our list of questions and my answers are blank,\" I said.\n \"To match your brain?That\u0027s not my fault,\"\n \"Half the soccer team is almost finished with theirs and we haven\u0027t even started. I know you\u0027re a procrastinator, but I\u0027m not cramming this in the night before it\u0027s due. Unless we pull an all-nighter-then I\u0027m game.\" His suggestive gaze bore through me. \"I know how you like to sleep in.\"\n I snarled and slammed my locker shut. \"I have a lot on my mind.\"\n Trevor blocked my exit.\n \"You\u0027d better do this assignment. You heard what Mrs.Naper said. If I fail this, it could affect my grades for college. I\u0027m not going to spend the rest of my life in prison with you.\"\n \"We\u0027ll finish it in time. I\u0027ve just been preoccupied.\"\n \"Doing what? Polishing gravestones? Painting your nails with blacktop? Conjuring the dead?\"\n Now he was getting on my bad side. \"Then maybe I won\u0027t do it,\" I challenged him.\n Trevor paused. His face grew red with anger. \"I knew that was your plan all along. I\u0027m not going to let you ruin my chances for a soccer scholarship, Monster Girl.\"\n The bell rang, ending our hostile discussion.\n \"Don\u0027t bother asking me to walk you to class,\" he said sharply.\n Here I was worried Trevor was planning to sabotage me when all along he was thinking I was going to do the same to him. My nemesis and I were more alike than I ever would care to admit.\n \"Remember, I know where you live,\" he said in his most threatening voice, \"and that monster family, too. And believeme, they will be here for a while. That house won\u0027t sell.\"\n Trevor started off for English class in a huff.\n I was taken aback by my nemesis\u0027 last statement. I raced after him.\n \"What do you mean the Mansion won\u0027t sell?\" I asked, jumping in front of him.\n \"Who do they think they can sell that bat trap to?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s an eyesore. And my dad says it\u0027s a major money pit. With all the new houses being built, who would buy a ghost- filled broken-down home when someone could buy a brand- new one?\u0027\u0027\n Trevor\u0027s injurious comment was actually a blessing in disguise. If the Mansion didn\u0027t sell, then Alexander couldn\u0027t move. My boyfriend could remain in Dullsville forever.\n \"I could almost kiss you,\" I surprised myself by saying.\n \"Then why don\u0027t you?\" he asked, his eyes piercing through mine.\n Just then the second bell rang.\n \"There\u0027s not enough time!\" I said, and escaped into class. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-21.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
