{"id":96128,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"I had never been so eager to return to school as I was the next day.\n I blabbed about Alexander\u0027s haunted, smelly, or leaking mansion (depending on my mood) in the cafeteria, gym, and hallways. The day flew by and I happily headed for sixth bell, until someone stopped me on the stairs.\n \"Listen, Monster Girl,\" Trevor said. \"I should have known when I picked you as a partner that I was picking the bottom of the barrel. But even I didn\u0027t realize how deep that barrel was. Either you meet me today or I\u0027m heading straight for Mrs.Naper .\"\n I was grateful to Trevor. Though I\u0027d never tell him that, I felt confident that Alexander would now remain in Dullsville. I hated to do the paper, much less see Trevor, but it was something I had to complete. And there wasn\u0027t any reason to postpone it any longer.\n \"Sure, today is as good as any,\" I said.\n Trevor was surprised by my positive response. He glared at me skeptically. \"I know... you\u0027re not going to show up.\"\n \"Why would I do that?\" I asked. \"That\u0027s so third grade.\"\n I wanted to meet my nemesis at a neutral place. Ididn\u0027i want him to use this as an opportunity for him and his soccer-snob posse to ambush the outsider. I neededsomi protection-a place I knew people would be around.The town square.The main library.The police station.\n We settled for the mall food court. Dullsville Mall was probably no different from any other mall in America,li had the same dress, shoe, candle, lotion, lingerie, earring stores, and kiosks as any mall. I wasn\u0027t a mall rat but rather a thrift-store junkie. But there was one thing I couldn\u0027t resist at the mall: the food court. Every time my mom or Becky dragged me there for a day of shopping, I was like a vulture on an abandoned carcass as I sampled the Ices, pizza, or free Chinese meat on a stick.\n Trevor found me waiting with a slice of cheese pizza and a frozen cherry drink at a table in the center of the food court.\n \"At last I have you all to myself,\" Trevor said.\n \"Evidently not.\"I pointed to a kid from the next table, waving to us like we were his family.\n \"Hello,\" the cute boy said. The small child reminded me of Trevor when he was in kindergarten-perfect blond hair, perfect white teeth, perfectly pressed clothes.\n \"Children are a great judge of character,\" Trevor commented.\n \"That\u0027s why he\u0027s waving at me, not you.\"\n \"Turn around, Lance. Sorry he was bothering you.\" The mother picked up her son and held him on the other side of their table.\n Trevor took a bite of my pizza.\n \"Hey, get your own!\"\n \"I heard about the Mansion,\" he said. \"I told you it was an eyesore.Rotting away. I can\u0027t believe you hang out in that hellhole. But maybe that\u0027s why you call it home.\"\n \"You\u0027re right. When I was there last week, we discovered a room full of flies. Just like the Amityville Horror.\"\n \"And you think that\u0027s cool?\"\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t I? Now, do you want to continue to talk more about how gross the Mansionis- \"\n \"No- let\u0027s get started.\"\n I hadn\u0027t even looked at the brief question sheet. It was folded up and stuck in my English notebook. Of course Trevor kept his pristine in a folder marked \"English Lit.\"\n \"Do you want to go first?\" he asked. \"Or shall I?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Please. Let me get this over with.\" He took out a pen, leaned in close, and began to read.\" \u0027When you were in kindergarten, what did you want to be?\u0027\"\n I glared back at him.\n I remembered that first day of kindergarten as clear as if it were yesterday. I had replied, \"A vampire.\"\n \"A princess,\" I said.\n Apparently Trevor remembered my real answer, too. I guess it wasn\u0027t every day that one had a classmate as odd as I had been and still appeared to be.\n \"That\u0027s not what you said,\" he challenged. \"You said, \u0027A vampire.\"\n \"Really?I don\u0027t recall. So you are going to write that down?\" I asked worriedly.\n I knew I was going to stand in front of my class and say, \"I wanted to be a vampire.\" Trevor would then say, \"Duh,\" and the classroom would fill with laughter and mocking students.\n Trevor scribbled something down on the sheet.\n \" \u0027Whenyou were little, what inspired you to feel this way?\u0027\" Then he paused and asked, \"Looking in the mirror and having it crack in two?\"\n Instead of clobbering him, I laughed-the kind of laugh that escapes into the air before you can catch it. The kind of chuckle that shows a tiny form of acceptance.\n Trevor obviously didn\u0027t expect me to find his remark entertaining. He was primed for a fight. We both cracked up and locked eyes. His gaze lingered a little too long, not in a creepy way, but in a way that saysI\u0027m not ready to let this momentgo.\n I felt strangely attracted to this nemesis of mine. I hated that we had any civility between us. But mostly I hated that I\u0027d let my guard down.\n I was born that way,I wanted to say. Perhaps a psychologist might trace my wanting to be a vampire back to time spentwith my father watching Dracula movies. And when my brother was born all that changed.Nosferatu kept me company on the lonely nights they were tending to the crying Nerd Boy.\n \"No,\" I finally said. \"It was when I didn\u0027t see my reflection.\"\n \"Fine, I\u0027ll write that,\" he said. \"Next question. \u0027Do you still have that same wish you had in kindergarten?\u0027\"\n \"Yes, I\u0027m sixteen and I still want to be a vampire,\" I said sarcastically. I really was masking my innermost feelings. In fact, that isexactly what I wanted to be.\n I knew what Mrs.Naper was getting at. Some people change their minds along their life\u0027s path. And some people come into this world knowing exactly what they want to do. I was in the latter group.\n \" \u0027Whatdo your parents do? Would you want to follow in their paths?\u0027\" he continued.\n \"What do you think?\"\n I took out my paper. \"I bet I can answer your questions without even asking you. When you were in kindergarten you wanted to be Superman, probably because you watched it on TV and liked being a superhero. But now, you obviously don\u0027t want to run around with a pillowcase cape. You want to be a professional soccer player. But you are afraid that once you get out of this small town, where youare Superman, you\u0027ll find out there are better players with more speed and quicker moves. And it is that part of you that when doing an assignment like this would write \u0027real estate developer,\u0027 like your father. Because you are afraid of failure and you don\u0027t have the courage to write down what you really want to be,\"\n Trevor was immobilized and turned ghost white. He was blown away, as if by knowing him all these Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,years I\u0027d read his soul. I wasn\u0027t sure if this realization angered him or made him more attracted to me. I wasn\u0027t going to stay to find out.\n I put the sheet in my backpack and left.\n I could only imagine that in the spot regarding what I wanted to be in kindergarten, he crossed out vampire and wrotepsychic. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-23.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
