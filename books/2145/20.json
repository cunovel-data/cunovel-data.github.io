Out of breath, I flung my Trek against the brick wall and scaled the fence. Votives on tombstones lit my way through the dusky graveyard. As I ran through the graveyard, rain began to drizzle down and extinguish the votives as I passed them. Fog slowly enveloped the landscape as if it were trying to keep me away. In the distance, Alexander was standing next to his grandmother\u0027s monument. I stormed over to him. \"I don\u0027t want you to leave!\" I cried. \"What are you talking about?\" he asked. \"I saw the ad in the paper! Your parents are selling the Mansion. Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" \"I wanted to, but I just needed to get some answers first.\" \"Answers? You are moving back toRomania ! I don\u0027t want you to leave.\" I clutched my boyfriend for dear life. \"I know,\" he said, holding me tight. \"I don\u0027t either- that\u0027s why I\u0027m trying to figure out something.\" \"Why do you have to move back now?\" I asked, staring up into his soft brown eyes. \"After all we\u0027ve been through? When we have finally gotten theMaxwells off yours, mine, and Dullsville\u0027s back? This is the thanks you get?\" \"That\u0027s exactly why it\u0027s time for me to return home- according to my parents. By reuniting Valentine with his brotherJagger , I ended our family feud. Now my parents want me to return toRomania so we Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,can be a family again.\" \"Your life is here now!\" \"I know. I\u0027ve tried to explain. And just as bad, they see no reason to keep the Mansion. So now I really have nowhere to go!\" \"You\u0027ll stay here and live with me. My parents won\u0027t mind.\" \"I can\u0027t do that-then they\u0027ll know...\" Alexander had a point. If Alexander slept under the same roof as my parents, there would be no way to hide that he\u0027d be sleeping during the day in a coffin. \"What are we going to do? You can\u0027t leave, Alexander. Let me talk to them. Once they see my side-\" \"I\u0027m not sure they can be convinced. I\u0027ve tried everything. Yelling, sulking. I am their son. They want me with them. I can respect that. But they are ruining my life.\" \"And mine! They can\u0027t do this, Alexander! I love you!\" I held on to Alexander hard and sobbed uncontrollably. \"I understand why they miss you-they love you as much as I do. But why can\u0027t they just live here?\" \"Because their business is inEurope .And they want us to be around our kind. The reason they sent me here was because it was isolated, and it\u0027s now the reason they want me home.\" \"You aren\u0027t isolated anymore. You\u0027ve gone to dances and dinners and dates. Can\u0027t they see how much you\u0027ve thrived in such a short time?\" \"I\u0027ve tried to explain it to them. I\u0027m not sure they see it, though. They\u0027re old school.\" \"I never realized that my biggest conflict in our relationship wouldn\u0027t be me being a mortal and you a vampire, or revenge from some bloodsucking white-haired immortal, but your sweet parents.\" Alexander wassilent . \"It\u0027s me- \"I collapsed in front of a tombstone. \"If I were like Luna, from a vampire family, then they\u0027d approve of me.\" \"They adore you.\" \"But I\u0027m not a vampire.Romania is half a world away. I can\u0027t live a second without you-much less an eternity!\" \"Iknow, me neither.\" \"Then tell them you won\u0027t go!\" \u0027 \"I have.\" \"And what did they say?\" \"That my home is inRomania .\" \"I\u0027m going to talk to them,\" I said vehemently, rising from the ground. \"Let\u0027s go now. When they see how much my life will be destroyed without you, they might change their mind.\" But Alexander didn\u0027t move. Instead he pulled me to him and held me close as I continued to sob. \"I didn\u0027t see this coming,\" Alexander confessed. \"I knew when they were arriving here that they\u0027d cramp our style, but never to this degree.\" Then my despair turned to anger. \"Why didn\u0027t you trust me with this news? I don\u0027t understand why you didn\u0027t tell me right away, I had to read about it in the paper.\" \"I didn\u0027t want you to hear about it at all.\" And then I faced him head-on, exposing the saddest part of my soul to him. \"You want to leave, don\u0027t you?\" Alexander grasped my shoulders. \"Don\u0027t ever say that-not for a minute-don\u0027t you ever think that. My home is here, with you.Now and forever.\" I fell into him and we held each other, \"This is why you were keeping your parents away from me?\" \"I needed time.\" \"I can\u0027t even bear the thought,\" I began. \"This isn\u0027t possible! Well never see each other again. I\u0027m not letting you go! You should have told me.\" I knew Alexander\u0027s parents had missed him. Their only son, several time zones away.Left alone to be attended by a single butler. This wasn\u0027t what they wanted for him. He was supposed to be hiding from theMaxwells , not falling in love. \"I was trying to figure out a plan.\" \"I\u0027m all about figuring things out. And in this case, I think I know exactly what to do.\" \"Yes?\" \"A solution to your problems and mine.\" \"Okay...\" \"We\u0027re on sacred ground.\" \"Yes we are.\" \"I\u0027d be yours forever.\" \"No- that\u0027s not an option.\" Alexander stepped back. \"It\u0027s our only chance,\" I said, tugging on his shirt. \"I would be just like you-and your family. Then they won\u0027t worry about you being the only vampire in town.\" \"It\u0027s not time-\" \"Is there any other time better than this? Is there any better reason? If not now... then when?\" Alexander gazed down at me. His eyes were loving, yet sad. \"You don\u0027t understand what you are asking me to do.\" \"I absolutely do. If I become a vampire, we will be bonded forever-together for eternity. If I stay a mortal, I\u0027ll never see you again.\" Alexander paused. He was as dreamy as the first time I saw him. His hair blew in the breeze. \"My home is here,\" he said, \"with you the way it is now.\" \"You\u0027re the one making the decision for me,\" I challenged. \"Maybe I should make it for myself.\" \"What would you do if it was the other way around?\" he suddenly asked me. \"And there was some way I could be justlike you-a mortal.Then what?\" Take the vampire out of Alexander? I hesitated. I pondered the thought of changing Alexander. I never realized the strain and burden I was placing upon him to fulfill my dream. What if I changed him and he didn\u0027t like being a mortal? What if it changed his personality? What if he was bitter and unhappy and, most of all, blamed me? I never thought of it that way. \"Do you only like me because I\u0027m a vampire?\" he asked. \"Of course not.I\u0027d like you if you were a troll. But it is who you are. I wouldn\u0027t want to change you.\" \"And that is how I see you.\" He cupped my face in his hands. \"I love you just the way you are.\" \"So you wouldn\u0027t like me if I were a vampire?\" \"Of course I\u0027d love you, but... what if you didn\u0027t like being a vampire?\" Alexander asked. \"But I\u0027d love it! I\u0027ve always dreamed of being like you.\" \"You\u0027d never be able to tell your family about your new identity. And if you did, do you think they\u0027d be happy? Their daughter is a bloodsucking vampire? It might be fun in theory until you have to leave town because you are being persecuted, like my grandparents. You think you are an outsider now, but what do you think you will become as a member of the Underworld?\" I really hadn\u0027t thought of all the details, just the highlights. \"So when you say, \u0027Just bite me,\u0027 it is always much more complicated than that. I\u0027d be making a decision for you- for the rest of your life. And it\u0027s not an easy decision to make.\" Alexander was always looking out for me. Not just presently, but forever. \"You can\u0027t leave Dullsville. Promise me you won\u0027t!\" I said. \"I promise-to the best of my ability. I\u0027m trying to figure out a solution, every minute of every day.\" He squeezed my shoulders. \"Besides,\" he continued, \"I can\u0027t leave you here alone with Trevor Mitchell.\" I thought of the Mansion, of all the time I\u0027d spent in Alexander\u0027s coffin, the nights watching him paint or walking through the corridors by candlelight. \"My heart is breaking,\" I said. \"Mine is, too. It\u0027s something I never thought was a possibility. I thought the Mansion would remain our family\u0027s forever. And I\u0027d remain in it.\" \"Now you\u0027ll live inRomania ?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ll have to come with you. It\u0027s the only way I\u0027ll survive.\" \"We can\u0027t be so grim yet,\" he said softly, touching my cheek. \"At this point there have been no offers on the house. There\u0027s still time to figure out a plan.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-20.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
