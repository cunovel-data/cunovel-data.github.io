{"id":96114,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Guess who my dad and I saw last night when we were out to dinner atBrios ?\" Trevor asked me the following day before class as I opened my locker. \"A cheerleader?Ashopgirl ?Or a teacher?You\u0027ll have to narrow it down. I can\u0027t keep up with who you are dating.\" \"TheSterling ghosts.\" \"No way.\"I dropped my backpack and faced him squarely. \"You saw who?\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Death.You\u0027d better tell those morbid mannequins to go back to the dungeon they crawled out of. I was so repulsed I lost my appetite.\" \"Funny, you have the same effect on me.\" \"They\u0027re even freakier than you are. Are you sure you aren\u0027t their spawn, too?\" \"What did they do? Who were they with?\" I asked. \"Haven\u0027t you met them yet?\" Trevor seemed as surprised as I had been. \"Of course.Several times.\"I picked up my backpack and began shoving textbooks into my locker. \"You haven\u0027t, have you? I guess I\u0027m not the only one who thinks you are weird. Alexander does, too.\" His comments were like a stake in my heart. \"They met someone,\" he continued. \"Mr. Berkley came over to their table. I thought he might faint, but he didn\u0027t. \"Mr. Berkley ofBerkley Realtors?\"I then realized that his was the last suite in the Emerson building left to investigate. \"RumorIs that they want to buy the cemetery and move in.\" I was fuming. Trevor had seen theSterlings before I had. Plus, I was angered that he was ridiculing Alexander\u0027s mother and father. \"Maybe they want to buy your house and use your room for landfill,\" I countered. My mind raced as to how theSterlings were acquainted with Mr. Berkley. Was he who they really saw at the Emerson building? Were they planning on buying Jameson his own place now that they were home? I\u0027m sure there was a plausible explanation for their encounter. \"Could you hear what they said?\" I inquired. \"I think it was \u0027Can I borrow your blood?\u0027 How do I know what they said? So... when are we going to start our essays?\" When I see my boyfriend\u0027s parents,I wanted to say. Instead I slammed my locker shut and stormed off. I\u0027d been kept in the dark long enough. Everyone in town seemed to have aSterling parental unit sighting but me. I was going to make sure that all that changed. If theSterlings weren\u0027t coming to me, I resolved, I\u0027dgo to them. As the sun set, I took my RBI (Raven Bureau of Investigation) accessories: small backpack, flashlight, and compact mirror. Garlic powder was not necessary and in this case would repel instead of attract the objects of my investigation. It wasn\u0027t the first time I\u0027d snuck onto the Mansion\u0027s property. I knew the lawn and grounds better than I knew my own backyard. Still, there was one thing I hadn\u0027t counted on: The wrought-iron gate was locked. Alexander had been leaving it open, for my easy entrance. More had changed than I thought. I was going to have to scale the fence. I reached and tugged and climbed my way up to the top like I was on aMount Everest expedition. I guess sleeping in the coffin for all those weeks during the day didn\u0027t do anything for my upper body strength. But I persevered. I kicked my foot over the top of the gate. A gargoyle stared at me. I let go and dropped down with a thud. The Mansion appeared to be empty. I was just about to sneak in when I heard a car pull up to the gate and park. The gate was being unlocked. I stole behind a bush. The Mercedes drove through the entrance and up the winding driveway. It parked in front of the Mansion. Jameson got out and two figures emerged from the car, followed by a third. Was it Alexander? It was so dark I couldn\u0027t make out my own boyfriend. From a safe distance, I followed the shadowy figures as they made their way inside the estate, which became illuminated by candlelight, room by room. Once again, I was alone.An outsider peering in.In Dullsville, at school, in my own family, and now with my boyfriend\u0027s family. I saw Alexander\u0027s attic room light up. I assumed Alexander was painting or maybe dreaming of me as I was dreaming of him. Two figures suddenly appeared at a window. I flung myself back into a bush against the gigantic house. I craned my neck and strained to see up to the second story. Two deadly pale faces peered out thecurtainless window-like apparitions searching for something or someone they\u0027d lost. The figures Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,disappeared and the room went black, I had seen Alexander\u0027s parents!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-9.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
