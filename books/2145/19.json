He was waiting for me in the Mansion replica boxcar. \"Did they have a good time?\" my handsome boyfriend asked, fishing for reassurance. \"The best time ever. On the way home, they couldn\u0027t stop talking about \u0027Constantine and Cassandra.\u0027 How interesting and worldly they are. They were so happy to have finally seen the inside of the Mansion. Thank you so much for inviting my parents over-and me.\" \"I wasn\u0027t sure... with the whole bat thing happening.\" \"Are you kidding? They couldn\u0027t stop talking about it.\" \"My family adores yours,\" he said with a twinkle in his eye. Then he placed his hand on mine. \"But you must understand, I don\u0027t want you to get too excited-\" \"We all were excited. My dad was so impressed with the Mansion. It was a tour of a lifetime.\" \"I\u0027m glad they liked it, but-,\" he started. \"These last few days were more amazing than I could have imagined,\" I said, cutting him off. \"I love your parents. Can we trade?\u0027\u0027 \"Our parents?Sure. I think yours are cool.\" \"What?No way!\" \"My mom carries an umbrella in the moonlight,\" he said with a chuckle. \"And my dad insists on wearing a cape.\" I had no idea Alexander viewed his parents like I viewed mine-slightly embarrassing. \"I love your parents\u0027 style. My mom and dad think plaids orpinstripes is all the rage.\" \"Yours are way cooler!\" he said, tickling my side. \"That\u0027s just because they aren\u0027t your parents. If you lived with them, you\u0027d change your mind.\" \"And you might, too,\" he said. \"Especially when you know that-\" \"What was I thinking when I was spying on those two lovely people outside the Mansion. They don\u0027t have skeletons! Not in theircloset, or otherwise.\" \"There\u0027s something I need to tell you.\" Alexander turned serious. \"I was just being immature. Please don\u0027t tell them.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" \"Promise.\" I began to kiss my boyfriend,then snuggled against his chest. \"This is so much better than I imagined. I love having your parents in town. So we give up some independence. Who cares? We\u0027re gaining so much more.\" \"I have to tell you-\" \"No- there\u0027s something I really want to tell you.\" I stared into his deep, dark eyes. \"I finally think my life is perfect.\" Alexander looked shocked, then pleased. \"So what do you want to tell me?\" I asked. \"It can wait,\" he said resignedly. Alexander kissed me good night with such emotion it was as if he were kissing me for the first time-or the lust. \u0027I\u0027henext morning, I arose from a dead sleep and walked glass-eyed downstairs in my slippers and pajamas. I headed straight for the coffeemaker. My parents seemed strange-odder than usual. Solemn, like someone had died. My mom was hovering over the Sunday paper on the kitchen table. \"Maybe she already knows,\" she said. I poured some coffee. \"Knows what?\" \"It\u0027s funny. TheSterlings didn\u0027t mention anything last night. You\u0027d think they would have.\" \"Maybe they are buying a new house?Something more modern?Something without bats.\" \"What are you talking about?\" I dragged my feet and leaned on the table. My dad pointed to the paper. Under the real estate column was a picture of the Mansion: For sale-Three acres. Sterling Estate, Benson Hill. Berkley Realtors My heart sank to my empty stomach. TheSterlings were selling the Mansion! This was what Alexander had been trying to say. Why his mother and father kept saying they\u0027d be in town for only a few months. Why Alexander had been preoccupied and in an unusually dark mood. If there wasn\u0027t a Mansion-there \u0027d be no Alexander, Alexander, the love of my life, was moving back toRomania .","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-19.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
