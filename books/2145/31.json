I thought it was a blast.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027m so proud of Alexander.\"\\n\\n \"I always knew he was talented. But Constantine-he knows now,\" she said with a wink.\\n\\n \"I just got off the phone with Mr. Berkley,\" Mr. Sterling said in a low voice as he entered the parlor. \"He said someone made an offer and they are going to come for a tour of the Mansion.\"\\n\\n \"When will they be here?\" Mrs. Sterling asked. \"We already have company\" she said, referring to me.\\n\\n \"He told me he should be here by now.\"\\n\\n \"I hate lateness,\" Mrs. Sterling said. \"It is so rude.\"\\n\\n Alexander came into the parlor.\\n\\n \"A prospective buyer is coming to the house. We\u0027ll be able to sell the Mansion and return... Where is that man?\" his father asked, agitated.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s here,\" Alexander said.\\n\\n \"Where, standing in the hallway?\"\\n\\n \"No, standing right in front of you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"I am going to buy the Mansion.\"\\n\\n \"You?\"\\n\\n Mr. and Mrs. Sterling were bewildered.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to tell you,\" Alexander said. \"This is my home.In this house, in this town, with this girl.\" He smiled at me.\\n\\n I was so proud of Alexander for taking charge of his life but was sure I was going to be in big trouble with his parents. I was ready for them to scream at me or throw me out.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should be leaving...\" I said.\\n\\n \"No, stay.You need to hear this,\" Alexander said, and turned to his parents.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you see? I\u0027ve been successful on my own since I arrived here. And these accomplishments are because I met the girl of my dreams, Raven.\"\\n\\n His parents looked at me, and I felt an immense pressure build.\\n\\n \"Because ofJagger , I\u0027ve had to leaveRomania several times. And now that I\u0027ve helped theMaxwells , I\u0027m supposed to leave this town. I\u0027m not leaving anymore.\"\\n\\n \"How did you plan to purchase the Mansion?\" Mr. Sterling asked, still shocked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to use the money I raised from the auction as a down payment. And when I turn eighteen, I\u0027m going to pay off the monthly mortgage with my trust fund.\"\\n\\n \"That money is for your future\" his mother said, \"Your grandmother wanted you to have it for that reason.\"\\n\\n \"Thisis my future, Mother. Grandmother wouldn\u0027t want it any other way. And neither would I. This mansion may not mean anything to you. But it means everything to me.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" his mom said. \"I want you to live with us.\"\\n\\n \"I know, Mother,\" he said, and held her hands. \"But I\u0027m almost eighteen. I could be going off to college, taking night classes. Instead, I\u0027ll be here.Painting and being with Raven.\"\\n\\n Mr. Sterling paced around the room, wiping his hair off his brow. \"This is quite a shock, you must understand. I didn\u0027t realize, Alexander, how you have grown.That you are so much like your grandmother. That you both are...\"\\n\\n Alexander and I felt a glimmer of hope.\\n\\n \"When I saw that you were the artist behind those paintings, it was clear to me then that you\u0027d found a home here. But...\" He paused. \"There is no way you are buying the Mansion.\"\\n\\n \"I am!\" Alexander said boldly.\\n\\n \"No, Son, I\u0027m taking it off the market. It is rightfully yours. There is no reason you should have to pay for it.\"\\n\\n \"But, I want to-\"\\n\\n \"I know. And that is the reason you shouldn\u0027t.Because you care so much about so many things. I\u0027m not allowing you to buy the house from me. We\u0027ll invest the money you earned. My mother must be watching over us right now. I know she is smiling at you-and frowning at me. I made a big mistake looking at others when it was you I should have been showcasing.My own son. Jameson, get Mr. Berkley on the line.\"\\n\\n \"Mother, I\u0027m sorry-\"\\n\\n She put her fingers to her lips. \"You are the kind of man I always wanted you to become-you just became one a lot faster than I was ready for.\"\\n\\n \"I have to confess I haven\u0027t slept well since we decided to sell the house,\" Mr. Sterling added.\\n\\n Jameson walked into the parlor..\\n\\n \"Jameson, there has been a change in plans. The Mansion will remain aSterling legacy. Mrs. Sterling and I will be returning toRomania , but Alexander will live here. I understand you will be returning with us and we\u0027ll find another butler for Alexander.\"\\n\\n Jameson stood as straight as he could and took a deep breath. \"Sir, if you don\u0027t mind, I have a reason for staying in town, too,\" Jameson confessed. \"Alexander is not the only one with a soul mate.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-31.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \\n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
