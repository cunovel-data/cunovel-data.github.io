{"id":96123,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Afew hours before our cocktail party at theSterlings \u0027, I found my mom tossing dresses on her bed. She was as anxious as I had been when I was first invited to the Mansion. \"What do I wear?\" she asked. \"Whatever you want.\" Since my mother wasn\u0027t going to paint her nails black and wear a corset over the top of a camisole, I didn\u0027t think it really mattered what her attire was. However, she didn\u0027t feel the same. \"Should I wear this-or this?\" she asked, holding up the same blouse, one in white, and one in red. \"Mrs. Sterling is so stylish. Not that it\u0027s my style, but nevertheless it\u0027s bold. I don\u0027t want to offend her by appearing too conservative.\" \"Are you kidding?\" All of a sudden my mother cared about what the neighbors thought? I think she was as taken by Mrs. Sterling as I was- just for different reasons. I wanted to be like Cassandra, a beautiful royal-bloodedvampiress with a gorgeous vampire family, residing in an eerie mansion. But to my mom, Cassandra was exotic, unique, and worldly. Different, like my mom had been in her pre-corporate days. \"Mom, you are fine just the way you are.\" \"You\u0027re only saying that because you want me to hurry up.\" \"No, I mean it. I don\u0027t think eyebrow piercings and spidertatts will go with your Donna Karan blouses.\" \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027ll just be me-plain old boring me,\" my mother said, folding her arms. \"You are far from boring.\" \"I guess I just wanted you to think your mom was cool.\" \"You\u0027re not supposed to be cool to me. You\u0027re my mom. Do you think Grandma is cool?\" \"I see your point. I didn\u0027t do too bad a job raising you after all, did I?\" \"Well, if you must know, you could raise my allowance.\" It was a moment I was excited about and dreaded at the same time.My parents visiting the Mansion. What would they say? What would they do? How would they respond tobloodred smoothies? My dad inched his SUV up the Mansion\u0027s drive. Fog hovered over the bushes and candles flickered inside the Mansion. \"It looks haunted,\" my mom mumbled to my father. \"I know why you like coming here,\" she said to me. \"It\u0027s very... mysterious.\" \"I\u0027m anxious to see what it looks like inside. I feel very privileged. Like Charlie getting a chance to see the inside of the chocolate factory,\" my dad said. \"Promise me you both will behave. They have very different tastes. Please don\u0027t say anything rude,\" I said. I walked up the uneven cracked front steps, my parents following close behind. I knocked on the serpent knocker. \"That is quite... unusual,\" my mom remarked. \"Shhh!\"I said. \"You promised.\" The oak door squeaked open and Jameson appeared in the entrance, \"Welcome, Miss Raven, and Mr. and Mrs. Madison. Shall I take your things?\" My mom immediately felt the chill in the air. \"Thank you, Jameson, but keep my sweater.\" She had it tied around her shoulders but loosened it and put it back on. \"TheSterlings will be down shortly. May I get you a drink while you wait?\" \"No thank you,\" my mother said. \"We can wait for theSterlings .\" \"Why don\u0027t you have a seat in the parlor room? They will only be a moment.\" Jameson showed us in. Candelabras and votives filled the Mansion. Skeleton lights were strung from the ceiling. Harpsichord music played loudlyThis time I expected to see aPhantom of the Opera-type musician banging out his melodies on a giant organ, but I found neither. My father scanned the dusty books, and my mom fascinated herself with the vintage furniture. \"This is the home you\u0027ve always wanted to live in,\" she said to me. \"This must be a dream come true for you.\" I appreciated my mother\u0027s moment of understanding. I had a feeling that everything would be okay, though there was a teensy-weensy bit of my overactive imagination that wondered if my parents would be safe partying with two vampires on their home soil. But when I saw Alexander enter the parlor, I knew that if there was a turn for the worse, he\u0027d protect us from any harm. My handsome Knight of Night came over to me and kissed me softly on the cheek. He shook my father\u0027s hand, and my mother gave him a gentle hug. He returned to me and took my hand. His hand felt strong in mine, and I squeezed it hard. \"I\u0027m sorry to have kept you waiting. May I get you something to drink?\" \"No, we were just browsing. This room is charming. I can feel the history in its walls,\" my mom said. \"Yes, my grandmother was very proud of this mansion. That is why I\u0027m so horrified...\" We all glanced at Alexander. \"...that some of the boards need repairing.\" Alexander\u0027s comment was odd. The whole house appeared to need repairing-well beyond a few floorboards. We heard the lyrical Romanian accents of theSterlings as they entered. \"My apologies for our delay,\" Mrs. Sterling said, extending her hand to my mom, then my dad. She wore a lavender scarf around her neck. \"I hope you haven\u0027t been waiting long.\" \"We just got here,\" my mom said. \"The house is... beautiful.\" \"We were hoping you\u0027d be longer so we could peek around the house,\" my dad blurted out. \"A tour?\"Mr. Sterling asked. \"I think that can be arranged. Where shall we start?\" \"You\u0027ll forgive us if anything is out of order. We haven\u0027t totally settled in since we\u0027ve been back,\" Mrs. Sterling said. The house wasn\u0027t messy at all; in fact, everything was in its place. If anything, it was bare. Only what was needed was shown or on display. Now, dust andspiderwebs; that was a different story. There was a high volume of both. \"You\u0027ve already seenConstantine \u0027s favorite room,\" Mrs. Sterling said, gesturing back to the parlor as we continued on. \"Did Jameson tell you? When someone passed away in the family the parlor was used to view the dead.\" My dad was impressed. My mom was aghast. \"Fortunately, that doesn\u0027t happen very often in our family,\" she added cryptically. \"Who are the people in the hallway?\" my dad asked. \"I didn\u0027t see any people,\" Mr. Sterling said. \"Are you referring to ghosts?\" \"No,\" my dad said with a chuckle.\"Lining the hallway.\" We followed Mr. Sterling in the corridor. \"These are portraits of our family.\" \"If you don\u0027t mind my saying... this guy bears a resemblance to Dracula.\" \"Dad!\" \"No- I like your eye, Paul. We think so, too. The artist was watching too manyBela Lugosi movies when they sat down for that one.\" \"Alexander, would you mind going upstairs and taking over the tour? I hope I\u0027m not being rude-I\u0027d just like to make sure everything is in order,\" Mrs. Sterling said. Order?What did that mean? What was Mrs. Sterling planning on serving us? We followed Alexander up the red velvet stairs. The corridor was long, cold, and devoid of modern material possessions. \"This is the library and these are bedrooms,\" Alexander explained. My dad poked his head into the library while my mom checked out the bathroom. Antique fixtures adorned the massive room. I noticed her trying to find something. \"This is a quick tour,\" I said. \"We\u0027re not moving in.\" \"I wanted to check my lipstick,\" she said. \"But there\u0027s no mirror.\" \"Your makeup is fine.\" \"Wow- there are a lot of bedrooms,\" my dad said as he poked his head in each one. \"This is Jameson\u0027s room,\" Alexander said, showing us the butler\u0027s quarters, with its single bed and dresser, \"And this is my parents\u0027.\" Mr. and Mrs. Sterling\u0027s door was slightly ajar. We could see a vanity dresser topped with assorted makeup and with a frame attached, missing its mirror. My mom peered in, brushing against the door. It opened to reveal the side of a coffin. My mom gasped. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" my dad asked, standing behind me. My mother turned ghost white.\"Nothing. I just thought I saw something, that\u0027s all. It must have been the lighting.\" Alexander shut his parents\u0027 door. \"I forgot. Jameson didn\u0027t get to clean it and if it isn\u0027t perfect...\" \"We understand. I wouldn\u0027t want to give a tour of our house anytime soon,\" I said. \"Those stairs lead to my attic room, but I wasn\u0027t expecting-\" \"I think we should help your mother,\" my mom said hurriedly. Alexander and my dad talked about the Mansion as my mother pulled me to the side. \"I saw a coffin in the bedroom.\" \"Mom.Do you really believe Mr. or Mrs. Sterling would sleep in a coffin?\" She paused. Then she let out a laugh. \"I\u0027m sorry,Raven . This house is kind of spooky. I guess I just got caught up in it. You\u0027re right. It must have been a chest of some sort.\" \"Duh!You think I\u0027d date someone whose mother slept in a coffin?\" \"Well...,\" she said, with another laugh. \"Let\u0027s hurry up before they think we\u0027re snooping,\" I said. We found Mr. and Mrs. Sterling setting out napkins on the coffee table in the living room. \"Your home is very... historic,\" my mother said. \"I was hoping you\u0027d like it,\" Mrs. Sterling said, pleased. \"It\u0027s not everyone\u0027s taste, we know. We love it because it has character.\" Just then something flew overhead. My mom let out a scream. \"Sarah! Calm down,\" my dad said, \"I thought I just saw a bird.\" \"Not a bird, Sarah,\" Mr. Sterling said, \"It was a bat.\" \"A bat?\" \"We are so sorry. That happens from time to time, this house being so old and all.\" \"Jameson!\" Mrs. Sterling called. \"Can we take it home?\" I asked. \"Of course not!\" my mom exclaimed. Alexander was growing paler by the moment, Jameson rushed in holding abroom, I found it comical watching the creepy man struggle as he chased the flying creature into another room, \"Well, that doesn\u0027t happen every day.\" My mom laughed. \"As a matter of fact, it does,\" Mr. Sterling commented. Alexander quickly changed the subject to the weather, but when the forecast called for sunny skies, Mrs. Sterling became antsy. \"What about having a few BloodyMary\u0027s ?\" she suggested. \"I\u0027m not sure theMadisons like those, Mom,\" Alexander said. \"Perhaps you prefer wine?\" Mr. Sterling asked. I wanted to steer my parents away from anything red, just in case there was amixup in the kitchen. \"My parents love beer and martinis.\" \"Raven, don\u0027t be rude,\" my mother scolded. \"Of course,\" Mr. Sterling said.\"Jameson, two martinis.\" \"Make mine dry, please,\" my dad said. And clear, I wanted to say.Very clear. Jameson brought us trays of fancy finger foods. Tiny pastries and miniature sandwiches filled the pewter serving plates. I was afraid to ask what was inside, but that didn\u0027t stop my mother. \"Liver.Kidney.And-\" Mrs. Sterling began before my mom cut her off. \"I\u0027m still full from dinner,\" she remarked, and quickly switched to the pastries. The pastries melted in our mouths and I craved more. I was scooping up a diamond-shaped one when my mom picked up the conversation. \"I couldn\u0027t help but notice,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t have any mirrors. Not in the bathroom or the hallway.\" \"We have some in the basement,\" Mrs. Sterling answered truthfully. I remembered seeing them when Fd snuck in one time. \"We just haven\u0027t hung them up,\" she continued. \"But how do you put on makeup?\" \"Practice.Plus,Constantine will not hesitate to tell me if it is askew.\" They all laughed. We continued to eat and drink and converse aboutRomania and Dullsville. \"We really appreciate your inviting us to your home/\u0027 Mrs. Sterling said. \"We have kept to ourselves since we returned here. This town doesn\u0027t seem to be very inviting to outsiders.\" \"Well, I\u0027m hoping to fix that before it\u0027s too late,\" my mom said. \"We wouldn\u0027t want you to feel unwelcome.\" Mr. Sterling and Mrs. Sterling glanced at each other knowingly. \"I think we\u0027ll always be outsiders,\" Mrs. Sterling said, \"no matter where we go.\" As we all said our good-byes, I glanced over at my parents hugging and shaking hands with the Sterlings . I felt higher than a soaring bat, watching a scene I\u0027d never have imagined even in my wildest dreams.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-18.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
