Wait in the study.\"\\n\\n I paced in the old, dusty, book-filled room. It was several minutes later when Alexander appeared in jeans and a T- shirt.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Everything!\"I rushed over to him. \"But we have to talk privately.\"\\n\\n \"The gazebo?\" he suggested.a place where no one on earth can hear us.\"\\n\\n Alexander parked the Mercedes in front of the cemetery\u0027s entrance. We hurried toward his grandmother\u0027s monument. The only sound we heard were a few crickets chirping.\\n\\n \"There is a buyer for the Mansion,\" I blurted out when we reached the monument.\\n\\n \"You are kidding!\"\\n\\n \"No, and it gets worse. It\u0027s Trevor Mitchell\u0027s father.\" \"This is awful. I thought our plan was working.\" \"I did, too. He plans to tear down the house and built I a strip mall,\"\\n\\n \"Tear it down?\" Alexander\u0027s warm brown eves turned fiery red.\\n\\n \"I know. It\u0027s horrible. We did such a great job of convincing people that the Mansion was a money pit that no one wanted to buy it. Now they just want to tear it down.messed everything up, Alexander. I ruinedeverything \"\\n\\n I sat down on a cemetery bench and covered my face with my hands.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t your fault, Raven,\" Alexander said, comforting me. His dark mood brightened. \"He hasn\u0027t bough I the house yet. There is still time.\"\\n\\n \"If we tell your parents, maybe they won\u0027t sell?\"\\n\\n \"My father is set on selling. I\u0027ve even faced him with that possibility. He says the new owner is entitled to do with the house as they wish. But how did you find thisMy father hasn\u0027t said anyone has expressed interest.\"\\n\\n \"I heard it straight from the horse\u0027s mouth: Trevor.\"\\n\\n \"There has to be something we can do. I don\u0027t want to move, and the Mansion is not worthless.\"\\n\\n I turned toward his grandmother\u0027s monument and wished for an answer.\\n\\n \"We have to stop him. His father can\u0027t buy it. No one can. That house is your home.Our home.And most especially-your grandmother\u0027s.\" I got up and walked over to the monument. \"Your grandmotherSterling built that house with love.For her-and her family.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said, \"It breaks my heart for so many reasons.\"\\n\\n Alexander joined me at the monument. \"It is my grandmother\u0027s house... and always will be.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the only one who\u0027s taking care of it. I know your grandmother would be devastated if it were sold-or destroyed. There is no other buyer that that house means more to than you and her.\"\\n\\n Then he turned to me. \"You say the smartest things!\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe I didn\u0027t think of it sooner.\" Alexander was exuberant. He gave me a huge kiss and swung me around.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"The Mansion is forsale \" he said with a grin. \"And I know someone who is just dying to buy it.\"\\n\\n I had no idea who Alexander had in mind to buy the Mansion. Whoever it was had to be rich and someone Alexander didn\u0027t mind hanging out in his grandmother\u0027s house. And how would that help him stay in Dullsville? My boyfriend promised me he\u0027d let me in on his plan as soon as we met again.\\n\\n The following sunset I met him at the boxcar.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t sleep at all,\" I said impatiently as I snuck inside.\\n\\n He took my hand and held me close.\\n\\n \"So tell me-who can you find to buy the Mansion?\" I asked with a bit of hope in my voice.\\n\\n \"I turn eighteen in a few months,\" Alexander began. \"And when I do, I\u0027ll be entitled to my inheritance. My grandmother was a very generous woman. So I figured it out-I\u0027ll be able to pay for the Mansion\u0027s upkeep.\"\\n\\n I was wide-eyed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll buy the Mansion,\" he said proudly.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a great idea!\" I took his hands and danced around. \"You are a genius.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to move back toRomania if I have a place of my own here, right? And I think my grandmother would be happy that I used her money to keep the Mansion.\"\\n\\n \"I love that plan!\" I squeezed my boyfriend and kissed him repeatedly. I was so proud of Alexander for his intellect. I was dating someone wise beyond his years.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m almost legally an adult,\" he continued. \"Then I\u0027ll be able to make my own decisions.\"\\n\\n Alexander\u0027s maturity was like an aphrodisiac.\\n\\n \"You are hot-and brilliant!\" I said, gushing.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get too excited. There is one hitch.\"\\n\\n \"Really?But I thought you said-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll need to put a deposit down and eventually pay closing costs. I do have money in the bank, but it isn\u0027t enough. I just need to come up with money for a down payment.\"\\n\\n The only monthly fees I knew about were those charged at Dullsville\u0027s video store. I was clueless when it came to housing costs.\\n\\n \"But where are we going to come up with that kind of money? \"I asked.\\n\\n \"Therein lays the problem.\"\\n\\n \"I only have a few hundred in the bank and about sixty in my drawer at home,\" I offered. \"I\u0027ll ask my parents for a loan.\"\\n\\n \"Enough for a down payment on a house?They\u0027ll just give that to a sixteen-year-old girl?\"\\n\\n \"No -to you,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Her seventeen-year-old boyfriend?I appreciate the thought, but I don\u0027t think that would go over well.\"\\n\\n \"How much money do we need?\"\\n\\n Alexander mouthed a number that was way higher than I had anticipated.\\n\\n \"Where can we find that kind of money?\" I asked, stupefied.\\n\\n \"That part I haven\u0027t figured out yet. But we need to before Trevor\u0027s father cuts a check.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-26.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \\n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
