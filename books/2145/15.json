{"id":96120,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The following day, I was in the garage putting air into my bike tires. My mom pulled into the drive, popped out of her car, and charged toward me.\n \"I\u0027ve invited theSterlings over for dinner,\" she declared.\n \"You did what?\" I asked, releasing the air hose from the tire valve.\n \"I invited them over,\" she repeated,\n \"Why?How?\" I stood up, shocked by my mother\u0027s news.\n \"I called them up. Why is that so strange? People have been doing that for years.\"\n \"But-\"\n \"Mrs. Sterling was so delighted,\" my mom continued. \"I don\u0027t think anyone in town has invited them out socially, so I was proud to be the first one.\"\n \"That is very nice of you... but-\"\n \"You don\u0027t want us to meet them? Or is it that you don\u0027t wantthem to meetus .\"\n \"Both.\"\n \"So you want them all to yourself.\" My mom sighed.\n \"Is there anything wrong with that? I just met them. Let me have some time alone before you start Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,parading them through the country club functions.\"\n \"Well, if I\u0027d known you\u0027d felt so strongly... I guess I can call and cancel.\"\n \"Don\u0027t youdare! You can\u0027t; that would be rude.\"\n \"I knew you\u0027d see it my way,\" she said, and gave me an overzealous mother- triumphs-again hug.\n Since I was a kid, allMadison family meals were spent at the dinette-a small, rectangular wooden table with matching chairs. A few scratches and stains showed its age, like rings around a tree. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner; homework; and many school projects took place on this table and chairs. The dining room, however, was reserved for holiday and extended family meals. Suddenly, fancy tablecloths, sterling-silver candle holders, crystal salt and pepper shakers, linen napkins, and china flew out of the china cabinet.\n \"We don\u0027t have any black lace tablecloths,\" I called to my mom, who was in the kitchen preparing dinner. I searched through the cabinet drawers for Sterling-like decor. All I found in our possession was a pale crimson, a white lace, and a plastic floral one.\n \"Why would you want a black tablecloth?\"\n \"Do you even know who you are inviting over?\" I settled for a brown cloth with embroidered leaves and began setting out my grandmother\u0027s china.\n \"I can\u0027t remember a time when you set the table without being asked,\" my mom said, holding a glass vase with fresh flowers. \"I\u0027ll have to invite theSterlings over more often.\"\n I positioned six plates evenly, measuring their distance by the width of my hand.\n \"You don\u0027t want to set it too early. It might collect dust,\" she advised.\n \"I want to make sure it\u0027s perfect.\"\n Henry and Billy Boy ran up from the basement like an incoming army. \"When\u0027s dinner?\" Billy asked.\n I was aghast. \"He\u0027s not going to be here, is he?\"\n \"Of course; he\u0027s part of the family.\"\n \"But I only set six.\"\n \"Then set eight. We have twelve place settings.\"\n I imagined the conversation switching from talk of life inRomania to talkStar Trek conventions.\n Rage raced through my blood. Billy Boy knew it, too. He raised his eyebrows in victory, and he and Henry took off for his room.\n I followed the nerd-mates upstairs. I found my new Purse Party messenger bag on my nightstand and knocked on his door.\n \"No ghouls allowed,\" he hollered to a few boyish giggles.\n I pushed the door ajar. I opened my wallet and flashed him a five-dollar bill. \"You\u0027ll ask to eat at Henry\u0027s?\"\n His face lit up as if I\u0027d just shown him a mint condition Luke Skywalker action figure. \"Sure.\"\n \"You promise?\"\n \"Cross my heart.\"\n I gave my brother the bill.\n He held it tightly in his hand. \"That was to ask,\" he said. \"Not to actually stay.\"\n My instinct was to hit him over the head with my purse. However, he had been trained by the best, so I refrained.\n I dug back into my wallet. I had three singles left. \"This is *to stay,\"\u0027 I said, handing him a single. \"This is \u0027to eat.\u0027\" I handed him another bill. \"And this is to \u0027not come back until late.\u0027\"\n \"We\u0027ll need money for a movie, then.\" \"And nachos,\" Henry added. \"I always eat nachos at the movies.\"\n \"I bet you do. Would you like money for video games, too?\"\n They both nodded eagerly.\n \"That was a rhetorical question.\" I snarled. \"This is all I have.\" I handed him a wadded ten and twenty and lint-filled change, \"But you can have my firstborn if you spend the night.\"\n \"That I\u0027ll pass on,\" he said as I blasted out the door.\n \"I thought we were going to have steaks!\" I said when I returned to the kitchen. I was missing the aroma of marinade and instead saw scentless water boiling on the stove.\n \"I decided to make pasta instead,\" my mom said.\n \"TheSterlings can\u0027t eat that. They have to eat meat. And they like it rare.\"\n \"Why- are they animals?\"\n I bit my black lip.\n \"Are you sure we can\u0027t still get a catering company?\" I asked. \"Or at least help in serving? They\u0027re used to having a butler.\"\n \"We are who we are-we don\u0027t change for other people. You know that. I think cheese tortellini with salad will be great. Besides, your dad is trying to cut back.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t about Dad. We are hosts.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they love Italian.\"\n I imagined a bloodthirsty and starving-to-the-boneSterling family leering at my parents for their real meal.\n \"Doesn\u0027t anyone in this family listen to me?\" I stormed around the kitchen and opened the fridge. I didn\u0027t expect to see blood-filled smoothies, but a girl can always hope. \"They don\u0027t like garlic, remember. No garlic bread.\"\n \"I know, you\u0027ve told me a thousand times.\"\n \"Well, you didn\u0027t remember I requested steaks,\" I mumbled.\n \"I\u0027ll need your help with the brownies,\" my mom nudged.\n Jameson served flaming pudding. Sarah Madison served microwave brownies.\n I zapped the dessert and realized I\u0027d spent so much time figuring out what to wear to theSterlings\u0027, I hadn\u0027t even begun to pick out what I\u0027d wear tonight.\n I raced upstairs and obsessed about what was the perfect attire to wear as one of theSterlings \u0027 dinner hosts. I changed outfits at least five times and, naturally, I settled on the first outfit I originally had on-a frilly black lace skirt, white bodice, black-and-red-striped stockings, and MaryJanes .\n I was exhausted by the time the doorbell finally rang. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-15.html","bookId":2145,"book":{"id":2145,"title":"Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Royal Blood (Vampire Kisses #6) \n Summer break is over, and Raven is hardly eager to be returning to Dullsville High.
