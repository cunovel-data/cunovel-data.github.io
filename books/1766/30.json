I grabbed her by the upper arm and hefted her up.\\n\\n “Come with me. Be good, and I won’t hurt you.”\\n\\n Her body trembled, but she didn’t try to fight me. I raced back outside, dragging her with me as I retraced my steps to the garage. Thankfully, there was no sign of Kyrin’s return. I approached the far SUV, the one with chains on the tires, low mileage, and turbocharge.\\n\\n “Open it,” I commanded the woman.\\n\\n “Op—open,” she whispered.\\n\\n Nothing happened. I banged my hand on the hood in frustration. “Say it again. In the right language.”\\n\\n “Luo,” she shouted.\\n\\n The door popped open.\\n\\n Relief pounded through me. “Now make it start.”\\n\\n “Pren,” she shouted, and the engine hummed instantly to life.\\n\\n I released her and slid inside the car. As she sprinted away, I programmed in the coordinates to my apartment. The garage door opened automatically and the car jolted into motion. The squeal of thick tire tread filled my ears as I sped away.\\n\\n I snatched the car phone and said, “Jack Pagosa, A.I.R.,” into the speaker. I heard the ring, but he never answered. Shit. I’d try again when I reached my home. I drove north for half an hour, and had almost given up finding a familiar road when New Chicago’s skyscrapers rose ahead, above the horizon. An hour later, I eased into my building’s parking lot. I left the car running.\\n\\n My steps clipped and frantic, I strode inside the building. The hallway was a broad opening into an expansive sunlit lobby that left nothing to obstruct my vision. Just as I rounded the corner, I heard a high-pitched you’re-looking-good whistle. I turned sharply on the balls of my feet. My neighbor, Eddie Briggs, paled when he realized who he’d just objectified.\\n\\n He was damn lucky I didn’t knife him.\\n\\n “Uh, hi,” he said, pressing his glasses up his nose and trying not to stare at my cleavage. He wasn’t doing too good a job. He stood in front of the elevator, tall, lanky, and young, probably twenty, with dark blond hair and freckled skin.\\n\\n “If you want to live, don’t comment on my clothes.” I never slowed my step and quickly passed him. I felt his gaze on my legs.\\n\\n “Uh, the police have been here looking for you,” he called.\\n\\n I stopped mid-step and spun to face him. “Did they question you?”\\n\\n I waited. Nothing further was offered. He just continued to stare at the gown beneath the jacket, and I waved my hand in front of his face until he actually made eye contact. “What’d you tell them?”\\n\\n “That I didn’t know nuthin’. That I hadn’t seen you in a few days.”\\n\\n “You did good,” I told him, jumping back into stride.\\n\\n Only when I reached my apartment did I stop again. I cursed. My ID unit was busted. I cautiously stepped into the foyer and scanned my living room. Nothing appeared out of place or destroyed, but…something didn’t feel right. The air pulsed with someone else’s energy. Someone, maybe A.I.R., maybe not, had searched my place. That someone might still be here.\\n\\n I unsheathed my knife. A thorough search revealed an empty trash bin and a missing answering unit, but thankfully, no intruder.\\n\\n I tried Jack again. After eight rings, I slammed the receiver onto the kitchen receptor, once, twice. Where the hell was he? My fingers stiff, I phoned the hospital next, only to be informed that Dr. Hannah was absent. Was everyone conspiring against me?\\n\\n After locking up as best I could, I hurried through the spray-shower, changed into fitted slacks and a button-down, then ceremoniously dumped Kyrin’s clothing into the corner. God, it felt good to wear my own things. Even better, I had strapped on a pyre-gun, clips, and several knives. I secured the necklace Kyrin had given me in my closet safe, where I usually kept old weapons. I didn’t know what I was going to do with it yet.\\n\\n Thankfully no one had stolen the SUV, so I used it to drive to the hospital. Anticipation filled me as I strode into Dallas’s room; sunlight streamed through the open blinds and gleamed on the white tile and silver bed rails. I stood there, drinking in every detail.\\n\\n Dallas was propped up on the bed, eating lunch and speaking with another agent. Garret Harsbro, I realized, a young recruit fresh from school.\\n\\n I felt a surge of joy and relief, consuming, pure. Dallas was alive, healthy, and whole. His skin possessed a strong pink tint. His motions were slow but sure. The only evidence of his recent brush with death was his thinner cheeks and the lines of tension around his mouth.\\n\\n He chuckled at something Garret said, the sound a little strained, yet I found myself laughing with him. True laughter. Uninhibited. He heard me and glanced over. I had to bite back a gasp. His eyes…even from this distance I could tell they were no longer the deep brown of before. They were lighter. Almost blue. Like Kyrin’s.\\n\\n “Mia,” he said, dropping his fork and returning my smile. “Damn, but it’s good to see you.”\\n\\n I rushed to his bedside and clasped his hand in mine. “Welcome back,” I said. “Welcome back.”\\n\\n He gave my palm a squeeze, his grasp weak. “Glad to be back. Dr. Hannah said I should be dead, but the gods must like me.”\\n\\n I blinked up at Garret. “Will you excuse us?” I asked. I didn’t give a shit if I was being rude. I needed some time alone with my friend. My best friend.\\n\\n Garret gave me an appreciative grin, nodded, then strode from the room.\\n\\n When we were alone, I turned back to Dallas and said, “How do you feel?”\\n\\n “Better every hour.” Suddenly the smile fell from his lips, and he eyed me with concern. “You missed Jaxon by ten minutes. Something’s going on, Mia, and it has to do with you.”\\n\\n I didn’t want him to worry. “I’ve been out of touch for a few days, that’s all.”\\n\\n He shook his head. “It’s more than that, and—” He paused, like my words had only just reached him. “What do you mean you’ve been out of touch? You’re never out of touch. Your job is your life.”\\n\\n “Long story, and I don’t have time to explain. What did Jaxon tell you?”\\n\\n “He wanted to know if I’d spoken to you since I’d come out of the coma last night. And of course I hadn’t.”\\n\\n “That it?”\\n\\n “Well, it’s what he didn’t say that threw me. Jack called on Jaxon’s cell. Another body was found this morning. I don’t know who. Jaxon wouldn’t tell me. Anyway, while Jack was talking, Jaxon turned pale. He whispered your name, and at first I thought you were the one dead. But when I asked Jaxon about it, he said I’d misheard and to call him if I spoke to you.”\\n\\n That didn’t sound good.\\n\\n “Jaxon bolted after that. I called your house and your cell, but couldn’t reach you. Your unit didn’t even pick up.”\\n\\n Trying not to reveal my trepidation, I kissed his cheek. “I’ll explain everything once I’ve spoken with Jack, okay?”\\n\\n He reluctantly nodded and tugged on my hand to keep me by his side a moment longer. “Be careful.”\\n\\n I managed a grin. “Always.”\\n\\n By the time the station house came into view, my unease had grown to unimaginable proportions. I refused to be a coward, however, so I maneuvered into the parking lot. I watched the building as agents came and went. Nothing seemed unusual. Resigned but still unsure, I slipped inside the lobby.\\n\\n Several agents greeted me normally with a quick “Hi” and a smile. Some rushed to my side, patted me on the shoulder, and asked how I was doing. I answered politely but sternly, “I’m fine,” and kept moving. Others eyed me with leery distrust and maintained their distance.\\n\\n When I reached Jack’s office, I paused, hand raised midair. I’d never knocked before. Why start now? I pushed open the door. Jack was in the middle of a sentence and cut himself off abruptly when he saw me. Jaxon, Jaffee, and Mandalay were seated in front of his desk, and all turned their focus to me.\\n\\n Jaxon jumped to his feet. He strode one step toward me, then stopped. “Are you okay?” he asked, concern dripping from his words.\\n\\n I gave him a weak smile. “As good as can be expected.”\\n\\n “He didn’t…hurt you, did he?” Jaxon asked softly.\\n\\n “No. He didn’t.”\\n\\n A moment of silence encompassed the room. Silence tight and heavy, unnatural.\\n\\n Finally Jack said, “What the hell are you doing here, Mia? We’ve had PD and agents scouring the countryside for three days. Three damn days, and you stroll oh so pretty into my office, as if nothing ever happened.”\\n\\n There was no time to explain. “I know who killed Steele, Jack. And the others.”\\n\\n “Yeah,” Jack said, easing back in his chair and popping antacids like candy. “So do we. Kyrin en Arr.”\\n\\n I opened my mouth to utter a determined, “You’re wrong,” but Ghost and Kittie rushed inside, halting my words. They flanked my sides and ground to a halt when they saw me.\\n\\n “Dallas called my cell,” Ghost said, dragging in breaths after every word. “He said you were on your way here.” He enfolded me in his arms. “Kyrin didn’t hurt you, did he?” he demanded, repeating Jaxon’s question. “Because I will personally find him and kill him—if you haven’t already.”\\n\\n “He’s still alive,” I answered, “and I’d like him to stay that way. He isn’t violent.”\\n\\n “Oh, he’s not, huh?” Jack threw back a few more antacids. “Then why is his voice DNA recorded at the scene? And why,” he added darkly, “are your fingerprints there?”\\n\\n There was something in his eyes, a gleam I’d never seen directed at me before. They knew I’d been at the scene, but did they know about my origins? Did they suspect? My attention moved to Mandalay. She hastily glanced away. Next, I focused on Jaffee. He, too, couldn’t face me for long. Jaxon, Ghost, and Kittie all watched me, each with equal expressions of concern and dread.\\n\\n I faced Jack. “What are you getting at?”\\n\\n “Think back to the day you were taken, Mia. One minute I’m watching you have a pleasant discussion with an invading Arcadian, and the next you simply disappear. We don’t hear from you for three days, and then we discover your fingerprints all over a crime scene. How does that look to you?”\\n\\n I didn’t answer his question, but spoke one of my own. “Do you think I’m guilty of murder? Is that what you’re saying?”\\n\\n Defeated, he slumped back in his chair. “No,” he said firmly. “I don’t. You’re the best hunter I’ve got. You’ve saved God knows how many lives, and taken God knows how many alien lives. But the top guns are out for your blood. They think you’re guilty, that you’ve helped Kyrin every step of the way.” He pushed out a sigh. “They want your badge.”\\n\\n Dread uncurled inside my stomach and launched a path through my blood. “Neither Kyrin nor I killed those people.”\\n\\n “I know you weren’t involved, but this Kyrin—”\\n\\n “Trust me. I—”\\n\\n “I trust you,” he interjected. “Always have. But I don’t trust him. And besides that, I have to do my job. Right now I have orders to take your gun and your badge, pending investigation. You’re on leave until further notice, and don’t give me any shit about it. This is standard procedure. You know that. You’re lucky it’s not worse.”\\n\\n “I’m keeping my gun, Jack, and I’m staying active,” I said, hand tightening around the gun in question. “Legally or not.”\\n\\n He blinked over at me, searching my eyes for…what? The strength of my determination? The lengths I’d endure to triumph? Whatever he saw deflated his intent.\\n\\n “I knew you’d be difficult,” he said, but there wasn’t any heat to his tone. “Fine. Keep your gun. I suggest you spend your time proving your innocence and bringing me the one responsible. But by God, you were never here. Understand?”\\n\\n “I didn’t see her,” Jaxon said.\\n\\n “See who?” Ghost asked. “Mia’s still missing.”\\n\\n “Think I’ll search for her in the Northern District,” Kittie said. “You know how that woman likes to shop.”\\n\\n “Get out of here before I change my mind,” Jack commanded gruffly.\\n\\n God, I loved these men. I gave each man a quick hug. When my arms wrapped around Ghost’s neck, he whispered, “You need anything, you call. Understand?”\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n I also knew what I had to do next. Even though it would make me look that much more guilty.\\n\\n When I stepped into the hall, I stayed in the shadows. I’d worked here so long, I knew every secret room, every place to hide. Sweat beaded on my face and hands, and my heart raced. What I was about to do was going to piss off Jack, and maybe destroy his trust in me. But this had to be done.\\n\\n Kyrin had said I had powers, that I had only to reach inside myself to find them. Atlanna, too, had said I possessed powers as strong as her own. I had felt glimmers of them over the years, and especially these last couple of days. I’d had no control of them, however.\\n\\n I had to try, though. I closed my eyes and mentally reached within my mind, plucking away the walls I’d erected there. One by one the stones fell, until slowly, so slowly, the entire structure crumbled. Nothing happened at first. I stood on the precipice, hovering, waiting, the force of everything I’d buried churning like a tempest.\\n\\n I realized at that moment I’d been asleep my entire life and was only just now about to awaken. With a shaky arm, I stretched out a mental hand. The moment my fingers penetrated the swirling fog, energy flooded me. My knees almost buckled from the intensity. So much power. It consumed me, ate me alive. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-me-darkly-alien-huntress-1/page-30.html","bookId":1766,"book":{"id":1766,"title":"Awaken Me Darkly (Alien Huntress #1)","description":"Storyline: Awaken Me Darkly (Alien Huntress #1) \\n RIDDING THE WORLD OF EVIL, ONE ALIEN AT A TIME: THAT\u0027S MIA SNOW\u0027S MISSION. \\n Snow is in the forecast. \\n In a time and place not too far away, Mia Snow is an alien huntress for the New Chicago Police Department.
