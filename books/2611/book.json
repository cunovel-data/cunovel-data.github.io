And even though there’s no real evidence pointing to a paranormal culprit, the deaths are straining the already-tense relations between Boston’s human and inhuman residents. \n As the bodies pile up, Vicky, her formidable aunt Mab, and her werewolf boyfriend Kane investigate, only to find that the creature behind the carnage is after something much more than blood… \n Publishers Weekly says, “Fans of Holzner’s other Deadtown novels will enjoy this solid yarn.”\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bloodstone-deadtown-3.jpg","author":"Nancy Holzner","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":58,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
