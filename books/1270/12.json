{"id":38760,"no":12,"title":"12 In a Glass, Very Darkly","content":"The setup was the same. Bond\u0027s travel literature was on the buffet table, where he had left it. He went through into the conference room. It had only been cursorily tidied. Scaramanga had probably said it was not to be entered by the staff. The chairs were roughly in position, but the ashtrays had not been emptied. There were no stains on the carpet and no signs of the carpet having been washed. It had probably been a single shot through the heart. With Scaramanga\u0027s soft-nosed bullets, the internal damage would be devastating, but the fragments of the bullet would stay in the body and there would be no bleeding. Bond went round the table, ostentatiously positioning the chairs more accurately. He identified the one Ruby Rotkopf must have sat in across the table from Scaramanga- because it had a cracked leg. He dutifully examined the windows and looked behind the curtains, doing his job. \\n\\n Scaramanga came into the room followed by Mr. Hendriks. He said roughly, \"Okay, Mr. Hazard. Lock both doors like yesterday. No one to come in. Right?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" As Bond passed Mr. Hendriks he said cheerfully, \"Good morning, Mr. Hendriks. Enjoy the party last night?\" \\n\\n Mr. Hendriks gave his usual curt bow. He said nothing. His eyes were granite marbles. \\n\\n Bond went out and locked the doors and took up his position with the brochures and the champagne glass. Immediately, Hendriks began talking, quickly and urgently, fumbling for the English words. \"Mister S. I have bad troubles to report. My Zentrale in Havana spoke with me this morning. They have heard direct from Moscow. This man\"-he must have made a gesture towards the door- \"this man is the British secret agent, the man Bond. There is no doubt. I am given the exact descriptions. When he goes swimming this morning, I am examining his body through glasses. The wounds on his body are clearly to be seen. The scar down the right side of the face leaves no doubt. And his shooting last night! The ploddy fool is proud of his shooting. I would like to see a member of my organization behave in zees stupid fashions! I would have him shot immediately.\" \\n\\n There was a pause. The man\u0027s tone altered, became slightly menacing. His target was now Scaramanga. \"But, Mister S. How can this have come about? How can you possibly have let it arrive? My Zentrale is dumbfounded at the mistake. The man might have done much damage but for the watchfulness of my superiors. Please explain, Mister S. I must be making the very full report. How is it that you are meeting this man? How is that you are then carrying him efen into the centre of The Group? The details, pliss, Mister S. The full accounting. My superiors will be expressing sharp criticism of the lack of vigilance against the enemy.\" \\n\\n Bond heard the rasp of a match against a box. He could imagine Scaramanga sitting back and going through the smoking routine. The voice, when it came, was decisive, uncowed. \"Mr. Hendriks, I appreciate your outfit\u0027s concern about this and I congratulate them on their sources of information. But you tell your Central this: I met this man completely by accident, at least I thought so at the time, and there\u0027s no use worrying about how it happened. It hasn\u0027t been easy to set up this conference and I needed help. I had to get two managers in a hurry from New York to handle the hotel people. They\u0027re doing a good job, right? The floor staff and all the rest I had to get from Kingston. But what I really needed was a kind of personal assistant who could be around to make sure that everything went smoothly. Personally, I just couldn\u0027t be bothered with all the details. When this guy dropped out of the blue, he looked all right to me. So I picked him up. But I\u0027m not stupid. I knew that when this show was over I\u0027d have to get rid of him, just in case he\u0027d learned anything he shouldn\u0027t have. Now you say he\u0027s a member of the Secret Service. I told you at the beginning of this conference that I eat these people for breakfast when I have a mind to. What you\u0027ve told me changes just one thing: he\u0027ll die today instead of tomorrow. And here\u0027s how it\u0027s going to happen.\" \\n\\n Scaramanga lowered his voice. Now Bond could only hear disjointed words. The sweat ran down from his ear as he pressed it to the base of the champagne glass. \"Our train trip . . . rats in the cane . . . unfortunate accident . . . before I do it ... one hell of a shock . . . details to myself . . . promise you a big laugh.\" Scaramanga must have sat back again. Now his voice was normal. \"So you can rest easy. There\u0027ll be nothing left of the guy by this evening. Okay? I could get it over with now by just opening the door. But two blown fuses in two days might stir up gossip around here. And this way there\u0027ll be a heap of fun for everyone on the picnic.\" \\n\\n Mr. Hendriks\u0027 voice was flat and uninterested. He had carried out his orders, and action was about to follow, definitive action. There could be no complaint of delay in carrying out orders. He said, \"Yes. What you are proposing will be satisfactory. I shall observe the proceedings with much amusement. And now to other business. Plan Orange. My superiors are wishing to know that everything is in order.\" \\n\\n \"Yes. Everything\u0027s in order at Reynolds Metal, Kaiser Bauxite, and Alumina of Jamaica. But your stuffs plenty -what do they call it?-volatile. Got to be replaced in the demolition chambers every five years. Hey,\" there was a dry chuckle, \"I sure snickered when I saw that the how-to-do-it labels on the drums were in some of these African languages as well as English. Ready for the big black uprising, huh? You better warn me about The Day. I hold some pretty vulnerable stocks on Wall Street.\" \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll lose a lot of money,\" said Mr. Hendriks flatly. \"I shall not be told the date. I do not mind. I hold no stocks. You would be wise to keep your money in gold or diamonds or rare postage stamps. And now the next matter. It is of interest to my superiors to be able to place their hands on a very great quantity of narcotics. You have a source for the supply of ganja, or marijuana as we call it. You are now receiving your supplies in pound weight. I am asking whether you can stimulate your sources of supply to providing the weed by the hundredweight. It is suggested that you then run shipments to the Pedro Cays. My friends can arrange for collection from there.\" \\n\\n There was a brief silence. Scaramanga would be smoking his thin cheroot. He said, \"Yeah, I think we could swing that. But they\u0027ve just put some big teeth into these ganja laws. Real rough jail sentences, see? So the goddam price has up and gone through the roof. The going price today is sixteen pounds an ounce. A hundredweight of the stuff could cost thousands of pounds. And it\u0027s darned bulky in those quantities. My fishing boat could probably only ship one hundredweight at a time. Anyway, where\u0027s it for? You\u0027ll be lucky to get those quantities ashore. A pound or two is difficult enough.\" \\n\\n \"I am not being told the destinations. I assume it is for America. I am under the impression that they are the largest consumers. Arrangements have been made to receive this and other consignments initially off the coast of Georgia. I am being told that this area is full of small islands and swamps and is already much favoured by smugglers. The money is of no importance. I have instructions to make an initial outlay of a million dollars, but at keen market prices. You will be receiving your usual ten percent commission. Is it that you are interested?\" \\n\\n \"I\u0027m always interested in a hundred thousand dollars. I\u0027ll have to get in touch with my growers. They have their plantations in the Maroon country. That\u0027s in the centre of the island. This is going to take time. I can give you a quotation in about two weeks-a hundredweight of the stuff f.o.b. the Pedro Cays. Okay?\" \\n\\n \"And a date? The Cays are very flat. This is not stuff to be left lying about, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \"Sure. Sure. Now then. Any other business? Okay. Well, I\u0027ve got something I\u0027d like to bring up. This casino lark. Now, this is the picture. The government is tempted. They think it\u0027ll stimulate the tourist industry. But the heavies- the boys who were kicked out of Havana, the Vegas machine, the Miami jokers, Chicago, the whole works-didn\u0027t take the measure of these people before they put the heat on. And they overplayed the slush fund approach-put too much money in the wrong pockets. Guess they should have employed a public relations outfit. Jamaica looks small on the map, and I guess the syndicates thought they could hurry through a neat little operation like the Nassau job. But the opposition party got wise, and the Church, and the old women, and there was talk of the Mafia taking over in Jamaica, the old Cosa Nostra and all that crap, and the boys lost out. Remember we were offered an in coupla years back? That was when they saw it was a bust and wanted to unload their promotion expenses, coupla million bucks or so, onto The Group. You recall I advised against and gave my reasons. Okay. So we said no. But things have changed. Different party in power, bit of a tourist slump last year, and a certain minister has been in touch with me. Says the climate\u0027s changed. Independence has come along, and they\u0027ve got out from behind the skirts of Aunty England. Want to show that Jamaica\u0027s with it. Got oomph and all that. So this friend of mine says he can get gambling off the pad here. He told me how and it makes sense. Before, I said stay out. Now I say come in. But it\u0027s going to cost money. Each of us\u0027ll have to chip in with a hundred thousand bucks to give local encouragement. Miami\u0027ll be the operators and get the franchise. The deal is that they\u0027ll put us in for five percent-but off the top. Get me? On these figures, and they\u0027re not loaded, our juice should have been earned in eighteen months. After that it\u0027s gravy. Get the picture? But your, er, friends, don\u0027t seem too keen on these, er, capitalist enterprises. How do you figure it? Will they ante up? I don\u0027t want for us to go outside for the green. And, as from yesterday, we\u0027re missing a shareholder. Come to think of it, we\u0027ve got to think of that too. Who we goin\u0027 to rope in as Number Seven? We\u0027re short of a game for now.\" \\n\\n James Bond wiped his ear and the bottom of the glass with his handkerchief. It was almost unbearable. He had heard his own death sentence pronounced, the involvement of the K.G.B. with Scaramanga and the Caribbean spelled out, and such minor dividends as sabotage of the bauxite industry, massive drug smuggling into the States, and gambling politics thrown in. It was a majestic haul in area Intelligence. He had the ball! Could he live to touch down with it? God, for a drink! He put his ear back to the hot base of the glass. \\n\\n There was silence. When it came, the voice of Hendriks was cautious, indecisive. He obviously wanted to say \"I pass\"-with the corollary, \"until I\u0027ve talked to my Zentrale, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n He said, \"Mister S. Is difficult pizzness, yes? My superiors are not disliking the profitable involvements, but, as you will be knowing, they are most liking the pizzness that has the political objective. It was on these conditions that they instructed me to ally myself with your Group. The money, that is not the problem. But how am I to explain the political objective of opening casinos in Jamaica? This I am wondering.\" \\n\\n \"It\u0027ll almost certainly lead to trouble. The locals\u0027ll want to play-they\u0027re terrific gamblers here. There\u0027ll be incidents. The native\u0027s will be turned away from the doors for one reason or another. Then the opposition party\u0027ll get hold of that and raise hell about colour bars and so on. With all the money flying about, the unions\u0027ll push wages through the roof. It can all add up to a fine stink. The atmosphere\u0027s too damn peaceful around here. This\u0027ll be a cheap way of raising plenty of hell. That\u0027s what your people want, isn\u0027t it? Give the islands the hot foot one after another?\" \\n\\n There was another brief silence. Mr. Hendriks obviously didn\u0027t like the idea. He said so, but obliquely: \"What you are saying, Mister S., is very interesting. But is it not that these troubles you envisage will endanger our monies? However, I will report your inquiry and inform you at once. It is possible that my superiors will be sympathetic. Who can be telling? Now there is this question of a new Number Seven. Are you having anyone in mind?\" \\n\\n \"I think we want a good man from South America. We need a guy to oversee our operations in British Guiana. We oughta get smartened up in Venezuela. How come we never got further with that great scheme for blocking the Maracaibo strait? Like robbing a blind man, given a suitable block ship. Just the threat of it would make the oil companies shell out-that\u0027s a joke by the way-and go on shelling by way of protection. Then, if this narcotics spiel is going to be important, we can\u0027t do without Mexico. How about Mr. Arosio of Mexico City?\" \\n\\n \"I am not knowing this gentleman.\" \\n\\n \"Rosy? Oh, he\u0027s a great guy. Runs the Green Light Transportation System. Drugs and girls into L.A. Never been caught yet. Reliable operator. Got no affiliates. Your people\u0027ll know about him. Why not check with them, and then we\u0027ll put it up to the others? They\u0027ll go along with our say-so.\" \\n\\n \"Is good. And now, Mister S. Have you anything to report about your own employer? On his recent visit to Moscow, I understand that he expressed satisfaction with your efforts in this area. It is a matter for gratification that there should be such close cooperation between his subversive efforts and our own. Both our chiefs are expecting much in the future from our union with the Mafia. Myself I am doubting. Mr. Gengerella is undoubtedly a valuable link, but it is my impression that these people are only being activated by money. What is it that you are thinking?\" \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve said it, Mr. Hendriks. In the opinion of my chief, the Mafia\u0027s first and only consideration is the Mafia. It has always been so and it always will be so. My Mister C. is not expecting great results in the States. Even the Mafia can\u0027t buck the anti-Cuban feeling there. But he thinks we can achieve plenty in the Caribbean by giving them odd jobs to do. They can be very effective. It would certainly oil the wheels if your people would use the Mafia as a pipeline for this narcotics business. They\u0027ll turn your million-dollar investment into ten. They\u0027ll grab the nine out of it, of course. But that\u0027s not peanuts, and it\u0027ll tie them in to you. Think you could arrange that? It\u0027ll give Leroy G. some good news to report when he gets home. As for Mister C., he seems to be going along all right. Flora was a body-blow, but, largely thanks to the Americans leaning on Cuba the way they do, he\u0027s kept the country together. If the Americans once let up on their propaganda and needling and so forth, perhaps even make a friendly gesture or two, all the steam\u0027ll go out of the little man. I don\u0027t often see him. He leaves me alone. Likes to keep his nose clean, I guess. But I get all the cooperation I need from the D.S.S. Okay? Well let\u0027s go see if the folks are ready to move. It\u0027s eleven-thirty and the Belle of Bloody Bay is due to be on her way at twelve. Guess it\u0027s going to be quite a fun day. Pity our chiefs aren\u0027t going to be along to see the limey eye get his chips.\" \\n\\n \"Ha!\" said Mr. Hendriks noncommittally. James Bond moved away from the door. He heard Scaramanga\u0027s passkey in the lock. He looked up and yawned. Scaramanga and Mr. Hendriks looked down at him. Their expressions were vaguely interested and reflective. It was as if he were a bit of steak and they were wondering whether to have it done rare or medium rare. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579/46896.html","bookId":1270,"book":{"id":1270,"title":"007之金枪人 The Man With The Golden Gun","description":"简介： 讲述了007与绰号金枪人的职业杀手之间的对抗。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/14/09-51-58-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
