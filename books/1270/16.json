{"id":38764,"no":16,"title":"16 The Wrapup","content":"The extremely smart policeman from the wrecking squad on the railway came down the riverbank at the normal, dignified gait of a Jamaican constable on his beat. No Jamaican policeman ever breaks into a run. He has been taught that this lacks authority. Felix Leiter, now put under with morphine by the doctor, had said that a good man was after a bad man in the swamp and that there might be shooting. Felix Leiter wasn\u0027t more explicit than that, but when he said he was from the F.B.I.-a legitimate euphemism-in Washington, the policeman tried to get some of the wrecking squad to come with him and when he failed, sauntered cautiously off on his own, his baton swinging with assumed jauntiness. The boom of the guns and the explosion of screeching marsh birds gave him an approximate fix. He had been born not far away, at Negril, and as a boy he had often used his gins and his slingshot in these marshes. They held no fears for him. When he came to the approximate point on the riverbank, he turned left into the mangrove, and conscious that his black-and-blue uniform was desperately conspicuous, stalked cautiously from clump to clump into the morass. He was protected by nothing but his nightstick and the knowledge that to kill a policeman was a capital offence without the option. He only hoped that the good man and the bad man knew this too. With all the birds gone, there was dead silence. The constable noticed that the tracks of bush rats and other small animals were running past him on a course that converged with his target area. Then he heard the rattling scuttle of the crabs, and in a moment, from behind a thick mangrove clump, he saw the glint of Scaramanga\u0027s shirt. He watched and listened. There was no movement and no sound. He strolled, with dignity, into the middle of the clearing, looked at the two bodies and the guns, and took out his nickel police whistle and blew three long blasts. Then he sat down in the shade of a bush, took out his report pad, licked his pencil, and began writing in a laborious hand. A week later, James Bond regained consciousness. He was in a green-shaded room. He was under water. The slowly revolving fan in the ceiling was the screw of a ship that was about to run him down. He swam for his life. But it was no good. He was tied down, anchored to the bottom of the sea. He screamed at the top of his lungs. To the nurse at the end of the bed it was the whisper of a moan. At once she was beside him. She put a cool hand on his forehead. While she took his pulse, James Bond looked up at her with unfocused eyes. So this was what a mermaid looked like! He muttered \"You\u0027re pretty,\" and gratefully swam back down into her arms. The nurse wrote ninety-five on his sheet and telephoned down to the ward sister. She looked in the dim mirror and tidied her hair in preparation for the R.M.O. in charge of this apparently Very Important Patient. The Resident Medical Officer, a young Jamaican graduate from Edinburgh, arrived with the matron, a kindly dragon on loan from King Edward VII\u0027s. He heard the nurse\u0027s report. He went over to the bed and gently lifted Bond\u0027s eyelids. He slipped a thermometer under Bond\u0027s armpit and held Bond\u0027s pulse in one hand and a pocket chronometer in the other, and there was silence in the little room. Outside, the traffic tore up and down a Kingston road. The doctor released Bond\u0027s pulse and slipped the chronometer back into the trouser pocket under the white smock. He wrote figures on the chart. The nurse held the door open, and the three people went out into the corridor. The doctor talked to the matron. The nurse was allowed to listen. \"He\u0027s going to be all right. Temperature well down. Pulse a little fast, but that may have been the result of his waking. Reduce the antibiotics. I\u0027ll talk to the floor sister about that later. Keep on with the intravenous feeding. Dr. Macdonald will be up later to attend to the dressings. He\u0027ll be waking again. If he asks for something to drink, give him fruit juice. He should be on soft foods soon. Miracle really. Missed the abdominal viscera. Didn\u0027t even shave a kidney. Muscle only. That bullet was dipped in enough poison to kill a horse. Thank God that man at Sav\u0027 La Mar recognized the symptoms of snake venom and gave him those massive anti-snakebite injections. Remind me to write to him, matron. He saved the man\u0027s life. Now then, no visitors of course, for at least another week. You can tell the police and the High Commissioner\u0027s Office that he\u0027s on the mend. I don\u0027t know who he is, but apparently London keeps on worrying us about him. Something to do with the Ministry of Defence. From now on, put them and all other inquiries through to the High Commissioner\u0027s Office. They seem to think they\u0027re in charge of him.\" He paused. \"By the way, how\u0027s his friend getting on in Number Twelve? The one the American ambassador and Washington have been on about. He\u0027s not on my list, but he keeps on asking to see this Mr. Bond.\" \"Compound fracture of the tibia,\" said the matron. \"No complications.\" She smiled. \"Except that he\u0027s a bit fresh with the nurses. He should be walking with a stick in ten days. He\u0027s already seen the police. I suppose it\u0027s all to do with that story in the Gleaner about those American tourists being killed when the Orange River Bridge collapsed. But the Commissioner\u0027s handling it all personally. The story in the Gleaner\u0027s very vague.\" The doctor smiled. \"Nobody tells me anything. Just as well. I haven\u0027t got the tune to listen to them. Well, thank you, matron. I must get along. Multiple crash at Halfway Tree. The ambulances\u0027ll be here any minute.\" He hurried away. The matron went about her business. The nurse, excited by all this high-level talk, went softly back into the green-shaded room, tidied the sheet over the naked right shoulder of her patient where the doctor had pulled it down, and went back to her chair at the end of the bed and her copy of Ebony. Ten days later, the little room was crowded. James Bond, propped up among extra pillows, was amused by the galaxy of officialdom that had been assembled. On his left was the Commissioner of Police, resplendent in his black uniform with silver insignia. On his right was a justice of the Supreme Court in full regalia, accompanied by a deferential clerk. A massive figure, to whom Felix Leiter, on crutches, was fairly respectful, had been introduced as \"Colonel Bannister\" from Washington. Head of Station C, a quiet civil servant called Alec Hill, who had been flown out from London, stood near the door and kept his appraising eyes unwaveringly on Bond. Mary Goodnight, who was to take notes of the proceedings but also, on the matron\u0027s strict instructions, watch for any sign of fatigue in James Bond and have absolute authority to close the meeting if he showed strain, sat demurely beside the bed with a shorthand pad on her knees. But James Bond felt no strain. He was delighted to see all these people and know that at last he was back in the great world again. The only matters that worried him were that he had not been allowed to see Felix Leiter before the meeting to agree their stories and that he had been rather curtly advised by the High Commissioner\u0027s Office that legal representation would not be necessary. The Police Commissioner cleared his throat. He said, \"Commander Bond, our meeting here today is largely a formality, but it is held on the Prime Minister\u0027s instructions and with your doctor\u0027s approval. There are many rumours running around the island and abroad, and Sir Alexander Bustamante is most anxious to have them dispelled for the sake of justice and of the island\u0027s good name. So this meeting is in the nature of a judicial inquiry having Prime Ministerial status. We very much hope that, if the conclusions of the meeting are satisfactory, there need be no more legal proceedings whatever. You understand?\" \"Yes,\" said Bond-who didn\u0027t. \"Now,\" the Commissioner spoke weightily. \u0027The facts as ascertained are as follows. Recently there took place at the Thunderbird Hotel in the Parish of Westmoreland a meeting of what can only be described as foreign gangsters of outstanding notoriety, including representatives of the Soviet secret service, the Mafia, and the Cuban secret police. The objects of this meeting were, inter alia, sabotage of Jamaican installations in the cane industry, stimulation of illicit ganja-growing in the island and purchase of the crop for export, the bribery of a high Jamaican official with the object of installing gangster-run gambling in the island, and sundry other malfeasances deleterious to law and order in Jamaica and to her international standing. Am I correct, Commander?\" \"Yes,\" said Bond, this tune with a clear conscience. \"Now.\" The Commissioner spoke with even greater emphasis. \"The intentions of this subversive group became known to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Jamaican police and the facts of the proposed assembly were placed before the Prime Minister in person by myself. Naturally the greatest secrecy was observed. A decision then had to be reached as to how this meeting was to be kept under surveillance and penetrated so that its intentions might be learned. Since friendly nations, including Britain and the United States, were involved, secret conversations took place with the representatives of the Ministry of Defence in Britain and of the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States. As a result, expert personnel in the shape of yourself, Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Leiter were generously made available, at no cost to the Jamaican government, to assist in unveiling these secret machinations against Jamaica held on Jamaican soil.\" The Commissioner paused and looked round the room to see if he had stated the position correctly. Bond noticed that Felix Leiter nodded his head vigorously with the others, but, in his case, in Bond\u0027s direction. Bond smiled. He had at last got the message. He also nodded his agreement. \"Accordingly,\" continued the Commissioner, \"and working throughout under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican C.I.D., Messrs. Bond, Nicholson, and Leiter carried out their duties in exemplary fashion. The true intentions of the gangsters were unveiled, but alas, in the process, the identity of at least one of the Jamaica-controlled agents was discovered and a battle royal took place. During the course of this, thanks to the superior gunfire of Commander Bond the following enemy agents- here there will be a list-were killed. Immediately after, thanks to Mr. Letter\u0027s ingenious use of explosive on the Orange River Bridge, the following-another list-lost their lives. Unfortunately, two of the Jamaica-controlled agents received severe wounds from which they are now recovering in the Memorial Hospital. It remains to mention the names of Constable Percival Sampson of the Negril Constabulary, who was first on the scene of the final battlefield, and Dr. Lister Smith of Savannah La Mar, who rendered vital first aid to Commander Bond and Mr. Leiter. On the instructions of the Prune Minister, Sir Alexander Bustamante, a judicial inquiry was held this day at the bedside of Commander Bond and in the presence of Mr. Felix Leiter to confirm the above facts. These, in the presence of Justice Morris Cargill of the Supreme Court, are now and hereby confirmed.\" The Commissioner was obviously delighted with his rendering of all this rigmarole. He beamed at Bond. \"It only remains\" he handed Bond a sealed packet, a similar one to Felix Leiter, and one to Colonel Bannister-\"to confer on Commander Bond of Great Britain, Mr. Felix Leiter of the United States, and, in absentia, Mr. Nicholas Nicholson of the United States, the immediate award of the Jamaican Police Medal for gallant and meritorious services to the Independent State of Jamaica.\" There was muted applause. Mary Goodnight went on clapping after the others had stopped. She suddenly realized the fact, blushed furiously, and stopped. James Bond and Felix Leiter made stammered acknowledgments. Justice Cargill rose to his feet and, in solemn tones, asked Bond and Leiter in turn, \"Is this a true and correct account of what occurred between the given dates?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said Bond. \"I\u0027ll say it is, Your Honour,\" said Felix Leiter fervently. The Judge bowed. All except Bond rose and bowed. Bond just bowed. \"In that case, I declare this inquiry closed.\" The bewigged figure turned to Miss Goodnight. \"If you will be land enough to obtain all the signatures, duly witnessed, and send them round to my chambers? Thank you so much.\" He paused and smiled. \"And the carbon, if you don\u0027t mind?\" \"Certainly, my lord.\" Mary Goodnight glanced at Bond. \"And now, if you will forgive me, I think the patient needs a rest. Matron was most insistent. . . .\" Goodbyes were said. Bond called Leiter back. Mary Goodnight smelled private secrets. She admonished, \"Now, only a minute!\" and went out and closed the door. Leiter leant over the end of the bed. He wore his most quizzical smile. He said, \"Well, I\u0027ll be goddamned, James. That was the neatest wrapup job I\u0027ve ever lied my head off at. Everything clean as a whistle, and we\u0027ve even collected a piece of lettuce.\" Talking starts with the stomach muscles. Bond\u0027s wounds were beginning to ache. He smiled, not showing the pain. Leiter was due to leave that afternoon. Bond didn\u0027t want to say goodbye to him.. Bond treasured his men friends and Felix Leiter was a great slice of his past. He said, \"Scaramanga was quite a guy. He should have been taken alive. Maybe Tiffy really did put the hex on him with Mother Edna. They don\u0027t come like that often.\" Leiter was unsympathetic. \"That\u0027s the way you limeys talk about Rommel and Donitz and Guderian. Let alone Napoleon. Once you\u0027ve beaten them, you make heroes out of them. Don\u0027t make sense to me. In my book, an enemy\u0027s an enemy. Care to have Scaramanga back? Now, in this room, with his famous golden gun on you-the long one or the short one? Standing where I am? One bets you a thousand you wouldn\u0027t. Don\u0027t be a jerk, James. You did a good job. Pest control. It\u0027s got to be done by someone. Going back to it when you\u0027re off the orange juice?\" Felix Leiter jeered at him. \"Of course you are, lamebrain. It\u0027s what you were put into the world for. Pest control, like I said. All you got to figure is how to control it better. The pests\u0027ll always be there. God made dogs. He also made their fleas. Don\u0027t let it worry your tiny mind. Right?\" Leiter had seen the sweat on James Bond\u0027s forehead. He limped towards the door and opened it. He raised a hand briefly. The two men had never shaken hands in their lives. Leiter looked into the corridor. He said, \"Okay, Miss Goodnight. Tell matron to take him off the danger list. And tell him to keep away from me for a week or two. Every time I see him a piece of me gets broken off. I don\u0027t fancy myself as The Vanishing Man.\" Again he raised his only hand in Bond\u0027s direction and limped out. Bond shouted, \"Wait, you bastard!\" But, by the time Leiter had limped back into the room, Bond, no effort left in him to fire off the volley of four-letter words that were to be his only answer to his friend, had lapsed into unconsciousness. Mary Goodnight shooed the remorseful Leiter out of the room and ran off down the corridor to the floor sister.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579/46900.html","bookId":1270,"book":{"id":1270,"title":"007之金枪人 The Man With The Golden Gun","description":"简介： 讲述了007与绰号金枪人的职业杀手之间的对抗。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/14/09-51-58-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
