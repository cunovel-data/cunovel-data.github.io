{"id":38750,"no":2,"title":"2 Attentat!","content":"The Chief of Staff stood in front of M.\u0027s desk and said firmly, \"I really wouldn\u0027t do it, sir. I can see him, or someone else can. I don\u0027t like the smell of it at all. I think 007\u0027s round the bend. There\u0027s no doubt it\u0027s him all right. The prints have just been confirmed by Chief of Security. And the pictures are all right-and the recording of his voice. But there are too many things that don\u0027t add up. This forged passport we found in his room at the Ritz, for instance. All right. So he wanted to come back into the country quietly. But it\u0027s too good a job. Typical K.G.B. sample. And the last entry is West Germany, day before yesterday. Why didn\u0027t he report to Station B or W? Both those Heads of Station are friends of his, particularly 016 in Berlin. And why didn\u0027t he go and have a look at his flat? He\u0027s got some sort of a housekeeper there, Scotswoman called May, who\u0027s always sworn he was still alive and has kept the place going on her savings. The Ritz is sort of stage Bond. And these new clothes. Why did he have to bother? Doesn\u0027t matter what he was wearing when he came in through Dover. Normal thing, if he was in rags, would have been to give me a ring-he had my home number- and get me to fix him up. Have a few drinks and run over his story and then report here. Instead of that we\u0027ve got this typical penetration approach and Security worried as hell.\" \n The Chief of Staff paused. He knew he wasn\u0027t getting through. As soon as he had begun, M. had swivelled his chair sideways and had remained, occasionally sucking at an unlighted pipe, gazing moodily out through the window at the jagged skyline of London. Obstinately, the Chief of Staff concluded, \"Do you think you could leave this one to me, sir? I can get hold of Sir James Molony in no time and have 007 put into The Park for observation and treatment. It\u0027ll all be done very gently. V.I.P. handling and so on. I can say you\u0027ve been called to the Cabinet or something. Security says 007\u0027s looking a bit thin. Build him up. Convalescence and all that. That can be the excuse. If he cuts up rough, we can always give him some dope. He\u0027s a good friend of mine. He won\u0027t hold it against us. He obviously needs to be got back in the groove-if we can do it, that is.\" \n M. slowly swivelled his chair round. He looked up at the tired, worried face that showed the strain of being the equivalent of Number Two in the Secret Service for ten years and more. M. smiled. \"Thank you, Chief of Staff. But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not as easy as all that. I sent 007 out on his last job to shake him out of his domestic worries. You remember how it all came about. Well, we had no idea that what seemed a fairly peaceful mission was going to end up in a pitched battle with Blofeld. Or that 007 was going to vanish off the face of the earth for a year. Now we\u0027ve got to know what happened during that year. And 007\u0027s quite right. I sent him out on that mission, and he\u0027s got every right to report back to me personally. I know 007. He\u0027s a stubborn fellow. If he says he won\u0027t tell anyone else, he won\u0027t. Of course I want to hear what happened to him. You\u0027ll listen in. Have a couple of good men at hand. If he turns rough, come and get him. As for his gun\"-M. gestured vaguely at the ceiling-\"I can look after that. Have you tested the damned thing?\" \n \"Yes, sir. It works all right. But. . . .\" \n M. held up a hand. \"Sorry, Chief of Staff. It\u0027s an order.\" A light winked on the intercom. \"That\u0027ll be him. Send him straight in, would you?\" \n \"Very good, sir.\" The Chief of Staff went out and closed the door. \n James Bond was standing smiling vaguely down at Miss Moneypenny. She looked distraught. When James Bond shifted his gaze and said \"Hullo, Bill\" he still wore the same distant smile. He didn\u0027t hold out his hand. Bill Tanner said, with a heartiness that rang with a terrible falsity in his ears, \"Hullo, James. Long time no see.\" At the same time, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Miss Money-penny give a quick, emphatic shake of the head. He looked her straight in the eyes. \"M. would like to see 007 straight away.\" \n Miss Moneypenny lied desperately: \"You know M.\u0027s got a Chiefs of Staff meeting at the Cabinet Office in five minutes?\" \n \"Yes. He says you must somehow get him out of it.\" The Chief of Staff turned to James Bond. \"Okay, James. Go ahead. Sorry you can\u0027t manage lunch. Come and have a gossip after M.\u0027s finished with you.\" \n Bond said, \"That\u0027ll be fine.\" He squared his shoulders and walked through the door over which the red light was already burning. \n Miss Moneypenny buried her face in her hands. \"Oh, Bill!\" she said desperately. \"There\u0027s something wrong with him. I\u0027m frightened.\" \n Bill Tanner said, \"Take it easy, Penny. I\u0027m going to do what I can.\" He walked quickly into his office and shut the door. He went over to his desk and pressed a switch. M.\u0027s voice came into the room: \"Hullo, James. Wonderful to have you back. Take a seat and tell me all about it.\" \n Bill Tanner picked up the office telephone and asked for Head of Security. \n James Bond took his usual place across the desk from M. A storm of memories whirled through his consciousness like badly cut film on a projector that had gone crazy. Bond closed his mind to the storm. He must concentrate on what he had to say, and do, and on nothing else. \n \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s a lot I still can\u0027t remember, sir. I got a bang on the head\"-he touched his right temple- \"somewhere along the line on that job you sent me to do in Japan. Then there\u0027s a blank until I got picked up by the police on the waterfront at Vladivostok. No idea how I got there. They roughed me up a bit and in the process I must have got another bang on the head because suddenly I remembered who I was and that I wasn\u0027t a Japanese fisherman which was what I thought I was. So then of course the police passed me on to the local branch of the K.G.B.-it\u0027s a big grey building on the Morskaya Ulitsa facing the harbour near the railway station, by the way-and when they belinographed my prints to Moscow there was a lot of excitement and they flew me there from the military airfield just north of the town at Vtoraya Rechka and spent weeks interrogating me-or trying to, rather, because I couldn\u0027t remember anything except when they prompted me with something they knew themselves and then I could give them a few hazy details to add to their knowledge. Very frustrating for them.\" \n \"Very,\" commented M. A small frown had gathered between his eyes. \"And you told them everything you could? Wasn\u0027t that rather, er, generous of you?\" \n \"They were very nice to me in every way, sir. It seemed the least I could do. There was this Institute place in Leningrad. They gave me V.I.P. treatment. Top brain specialists and everything. They didn\u0027t seem to hold it against me that I\u0027d been working against them for most of my life. And other people came and talked to me very reasonably about the political situation and so forth. The need for East and West to work together for world peace. They made clear a lot of things that hadn\u0027t occurred to me before. They quite convinced me.\" Bond looked obstinately across the table into the clear blue sailor\u0027s eyes that now held a red spark of anger. \"I don\u0027t suppose you understand what I mean, sir. You\u0027ve been making war against someone or other all your life. You\u0027re doing so at this moment. And for most of my adult life you\u0027ve used me as a tool. Fortunately that\u0027s all over now.\" \n M. said fiercely, \"It certainly is. I suppose among other things you\u0027ve forgotten is reading reports of our P.O.W.s in the Korean war who were brainwashed by the Chinese. If the Russians are so keen on peace, what do they need the K.G.B. for? At the last estimate, that was about one hundred thousand men and women \u0027making war\u0027-as you call it-against us and other countries. This is the organization that was so charming to you in Leningrad. Did they happen to mention the murder of Horcher and Stutz in Munich last month?\" \n \"Oh yes, sir.\" Bond\u0027s voice was patient, equable. \"They have to defend themselves against the secret services of the West. If you would demobilize all this,\"-Bond waved a hand-\"they would be only too delighted to scrap the K.G.B. They were quite open about it all.\" \n \"And the same thing applies to their two hundred divisions and their U-boat fleet and their I.C.B.M.s, I suppose?\" M\u0027s voice rasped. \"Of course, sir.\" \n \"Well, if you found these people so reasonable and charming, why didn\u0027t you stay there? Others have. Burgess is dead, but you could have chummed up with Maclean.\" \"We thought it more important that I should come back and fight for peace here, sir. You and your agents have taught me certain skills for use in the underground war. It was explained to me how these skills could be used in the cause of peace.\" \n James Bond\u0027s hand moved nonchalantly to his right-hand coat pocket. M., with equal casualness, shifted his chair back from his desk. His left hand felt for the button under the arm of the chair. \n \"For instance?\" said M. quietly, knowing that death had walked into the room and was standing beside him, and that this was an invitation for death to take his place in the chair. \n James Bond had become tense. There was a whiteness round his lips. The blue-grey eyes still stared blankly, almost unseeingly at M. The words rang out harshly, as if forced out of him by some inner compulsion. \"It would be a start if the warmongers could be eliminated, sir. This is for Number One on the list.\" \n The hand, snub-nosed with black metal, flashed out of the pocket, but, even as the poison hissed down the barrel of the bulb-butted pistol, the great sheet of armor-plate glass hurtled down from the baffled slit in the ceiling and, with a last sigh of hydraulics, braked to the floor. The jet of viscous brown fluid splashed harmlessly into its centre and trickled slowly down, distorting the reflection of M.\u0027s face and the arm he had automatically thrown up for additional protection. \n The Chief of Staff had burst into the room, followed by the Head of Security. They threw themselves on James Bond. Even as they seized his arms, his head fell forward on his chest and he would have slid from his chair to the ground if they hadn\u0027t supported him. They hauled him to his feet. He was in a dead faint. The Head of Security sniffed. \"Cyanide,\" he said curtly. \"We must all get out of here. And bloody quick!\" (The emergency had snuffed out Headquarters manners.) The pistol lay on the carpet where it had fallen. He kicked it away. He said to M., who had walked out from behind his glass shield, \"Would you mind leaving the room, sir? Quickly. I\u0027ll have this cleaned up during the lunch hour.\" It was an order. M. went to the open door. Miss Moneypenny stood with her clenched hand up to her mouth. She watched with horror as James Bond\u0027s supine body was hauled out and, the heels of its shoes leaving tracks on the carpet, taken into the Chief of Staff\u0027s room. \n M. said sharply, \"Close that door, Miss Moneypenny. \n Get the duty M.O. up right away. Come along, girl! Don\u0027t just stand there gawking! And not a word of this to anyone. Understood?\" \n Miss Moneypenny pulled herself back from the edge of hysterics. She said an automatic \"Yes, sir,\" pulled the door shut, and reached for the interoffice telephone. \n M. walked across and into the Chief of Staff\u0027s office and closed the door. Head of Security was on his knees beside Bond. He had loosened his tie and collar button and was feeling his pulse. Bond\u0027s face was white and bathed in sweat. His breathing was a desperate rattle, as if he had just run a race. M. looked briefly down at him and then, his face hidden from the others, at the wall beyond the body. He turned to the Chief of Staff. He said briskly, \"Well, that\u0027s that. My predecessor died in that chair. Then it was a simple bullet, but from much the same sort of a crazed officer. One can\u0027t legislate against the lunatic. But the Office of Works certainly did a good job with that gadget. Now then, Chief of Staff. This is of course to go no further. Get Sir James Molony as soon as you can and have 007 taken down to The Park. Ambulance, surreptitious guard. I\u0027ll explain things to Sir James this afternoon. Briefly, as you heard, the K.G.B. got hold of him. Brainwashed him. He was already a sick man. Amnesia of some kind. I\u0027ll tell you all I know later. Have his things collected from the Ritz and his bill paid. And put something out to the Press Association. Something on these lines: \u0027The Ministry of Defense is pleased-\u0027no, say \u0027delighted to announce that Commander James Bond etc., who was posted as missing, believed killed while on a mission to Japan last November, has returned to this country after a hazardous journey across the Soviet union which is expected to yield much valuable information. Commander Bond\u0027s health has inevitably suffered from his experiences and he is convalescing under medical supervision.\u0027\" M. smiled frostily. \"That bit about information\u0027ll give no joy to Comrade Semichastny and his troops. And add a D notice-to-editors: \u0027It is particularly requested, for security reasons, that the minimum of speculation or comment be added to the above communique and that no attempts be made to trace Commander Bond\u0027s whereabouts.\u0027 All right?\" \n Bill Tanner had been writing furiously to keep up with M. He looked up from his scratchpad, bewildered. \"But aren\u0027t you going to make any charges, sir? After all, treason and attempted murder ... I mean, not even a court martial?\" \n \"Certainly not.\" M.\u0027s voice was gruff. \"007 was a sick man. Not responsible for his actions. If one can brainwash a man, presumably one can un-brainwash him. If anyone can, Sir James can. Put him back on half pay for the time being, in his old Section. And see he gets full back pay and allowances for the past year. If the K.G.B. has the nerve to throw one of my best men at me, I have the nerve to throw him back at them. 007 was a good agent once. There\u0027s no reason why he shouldn\u0027t be a good agent again. Within limits, that is. After lunch, give me the file on Scaramanga. If we can get him fit again, that\u0027s the right-sized target for 007.\" \n The Chief of Staff protested, \"But that\u0027s suicide, sir! Even 007 could never take him.\" \n M. said coldly, \"What would 007 get for this morning\u0027s bit of work? Twenty years? As a minimum, I\u0027d say. Better for him to fall on the battlefield. If he brings it off, hell have won his spurs back again and we can all forget the past. Anyway, that\u0027s my decision.\" \n There was a knock on the door and the duty Medical Officer came into the room. M. bade him good afternoon and turned stiffly on his heel and walked out through the open door. \n The Chief of Staff looked at the retreating back. He said, under his breath, \"You coldhearted bastard!\" Then, with his usual minute thoroughness and sense of duty, he set about the tasks he had been given. His not to reason why! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579/46886.html","bookId":1270,"book":{"id":1270,"title":"007之金枪人 The Man With The Golden Gun","description":"简介： 讲述了007与绰号金枪人的职业杀手之间的对抗。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/14/09-51-58-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
