{"id":38752,"no":4,"title":"4 The Stars Foretell","content":"There are few less prepossessing places to spend a hot afternoon than Kingston International Airport in Jamaica. All the money has been spent on lengthening the runway out into the harbour to take the big jets, and little was left over for the comfort of transit passengers. James Bond had come in an hour before on a B.W.I.A. flight from Trinidad, and there were two hours to go before he could continue the roundabout journey to Havana. He had taken off his coat and tie and now sat on a hard bench gloomily surveying the contents of the In-Bound shop with its expensive scents, liquor, and piles of overdecorated native ware He had had luncheon on the plane, it was the wrong time for a drink, and it was too hot and too far to take a taxi into Kingston even had he wanted to. He wiped his already soaking handkerchief over his face and neck and cursed softly and fluently. \n A cleaner ambled in and, with the exquisite languor of such people throughout the Caribbean, proceeded to sweep very small bits of rubbish hither and thither, occasionally dipping a boneless hand into a bucket to sprinkle water over the dusty cement floor. Through the slatted jalousies a small breeze, reeking of the mangrove swamps, briefly stirred the dead air and then was gone. There were only two other passengers in the \"lounge,\" Cubans perhaps, with jippa-jappa luggage. A man and a woman. They sat close together against the opposite wall and stared fixedly at James Bond, adding minutely to the oppression of the atmosphere. Bond got up and went over to the shop. He bought a Daily Gleaner and returned to his place. Because of its inconsequence and occasionally bizarre choice of news the Gleaner was a favourite paper of Bond\u0027s. Almost the whole of that day\u0027s front page was taken up with new ganja laws to prevent the consumption, sale, and cultivation of this local version of marijuana. The fact that de Gaulle had just sensationally announced his recognition of Red China was boxed well down the page. Bond read the whole paper-\"Country Newsbits\" and all-with the minute care bred of desperation. \n His horoscope said: \"cheer up! Today will bring a pleasant surprise and the fulfilment of a dear wish. But you must earn your good fortune by watching closely for the golden opportunity when it presents itself and then seizing it with both hands.\" Bond smiled grimly. He would be unlikely to get on the scent of Scaramanga on his first evening in Havana. It was not even certain that Scaramanga was there. This was a last resort. For six weeks, Bond had been chasing his man round the Caribbean and Central America. He had missed him by a day in Trinidad and by only a matter of hours in Caracas. Now he had rather reluctantly taken the decision of try and ferret him out on his home ground, a particularly inimical home ground, with which Bond was barely familiar. At least he had fortified himself in British Guiana with a diplomatic passport, and he was now \"Courier\" Bond with splendidly engraved instructions from Her Majesty to pick up the Jamaican diplomatic bag in Havana and return with it. He had even borrowed the famous Silver Greyhound, the British Courier\u0027s emblem for three hundred years. If he could do his job and then get a few hundred yards\u0027 start, this would at least give him sanctuary in the British Embassy. Then it would be up to the P.O. to bargain him out. If he could find his man. If he could carry out his instructions. If he could get away from the scene of the shooting. If, if, if. .... Bond turned to the advertisements on the back page. At once an item caught his eye. It was so typically \"old\" Jamaica. This is what he read: \n \n FOR SALE BY AUCTION \n AT 77 HARBOUR STREET, KINGSTON, \n At 10:30 a.m. on WEDNESDAY, \n 27th MAY \n under Powers of Sale contained in a mortgage from Cornelius Brown et ux \n \n No. 3-1/2 LOVE LANE, \n SAVANNAH LA MAR. \n \n Containing the substantial residence and all that parcel of land by measurement oh the Northern Boundary three chains and fivee perches, on the Southern Boundary five chains and one perch, on the Eastern Boundary two chains exactly, and on the Western Boundary four chains and two perches be the same in each case and more or less and butting Northerly on No. 4 Love Lane. \n \n THE C. D. ALEXANDER \n CO. LTD. \n 77 HARBOUR STREET, KINGSTON \n PHONE 4897. \n \n James Bond was delighted. He had had many assignments in Jamaica and many adventures on the island. The splendid address and all the stuff about chains and perches and the old-fashioned abracadabra at the end of the advertisement brought back all the authentic smell of one of the oldest and most romantic of former British possessions. For all her new-found \"independence\" he would bet his bottom dollar that the statue of Queen Victoria in the centre of Kingston had not been destroyed or removed to a museum, as similar relics of an historic infancy had been in the resurgent African states. He looked at his watch. The Gleaner had consumed a whole hour for him. He picked up his coat and briefcase. Not much longer to go! In the last analysis, life wasn\u0027t all that dismal. One must forget the bad and remember the good. What were a couple of hours of heat and boredom in this island compared with memories of Beau Desert and Honeychile Wilder and his survival against the mad Dr. No? James Bond smiled to himself as the dusty pictures clicked across his brain. How long ago it all was! What had happened to her? She never wrote. The last he had heard, she had had two children by the Philadelphia doctor she had married. He wandered off into the grandly named \"Concourse,\" where the booths of many airlines stood empty and promotion folders and little company flags on their counters gathered the dust blown in with the mangrove breeze. \n There was the customary central display stand holding messages for incoming and outgoing passengers. As usual, Bond wondered whether there would be something for him. In all his life there never had been. Automatically he ran his eye over the scattered envelopes, held, under tape, beneath each parent letter. Nothing under \"B.\" And nothing under his alias \"H\" for \"Hazard, Mark\" of the \"Trans-world Consortium,\" successor to the old \"Universal Export,\" that had recently been discarded as cover for the Secret Service. Nothing. He ran a bored eye over the other envelopes. He suddenly froze. He looked around him, languidly, casually. The Cuban couple was out of sight. Nobody else was looking. He reached out a quick hand, wrapped in his handkerchief, and pocketed the buff envelope that said, \"Scaramanga. BOAC passenger from Luna.\" He stayed where he was for a few minutes and then wandered slowly off to the door marked men. \n He locked the door and sat down. The envelope was not sealed. It contained a B.W.I.A. message form. The neat B.W.I.A. writing said: \n \n MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM KINGSTON AT 12:15: \n \"THE SAMPLES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT 3-1/2 S.L.M. \n AS FROM MIDDAY TOMORROW.\" \n There was no signature. Bond uttered a short bark of laughter and triumph. S.L.M.-Savannah La Mar. Could it be? It must be! At last the three red stars of a jackpot had clicked into line. What was it his Gleaner horoscope had said? Well he would go nap on this clue from outer space-\"seize it with both hands\" as the Gleaner had instructed. He read the message again and carefully put it back in the envelope. His damp handkerchief had left marks on the buff envelope. In this heat they would dry out in a matter of minutes. He went out and sauntered over to the stand. There was no one in sight. He slipped the message back into its place under \"S\" and walked over to the Aeronaves de Mexico booth and cancelled his reservation. He then went to the BOAC counter and looked through the timetable. Yes, the Luna flight for Kingston, New York and London was due in at 13:15 the next day. He was going to need help. He remembered the name of Head of Station J. He went over to the telephone booth and got through to the High Commissioner\u0027s Office. He asked for Commander Ross. After a moment a girl\u0027s voice came on the line. \"Commander Ross\u0027s assistant. Can I help you?\" \n There was something vaguely familiar in the lilt of the voice. Bond said, \"Could I speak to Commander Ross? This is a friend from London.\" \n The girl\u0027s voice became suddenly alert. \"I\u0027m afraid Commander Ross is away from Jamaica. Is there anything I can do?\" There was a pause. \"What name did you say?\" \n \"I didn\u0027t say any name. But in fact it\u0027s. . . .\" \n The voice broke in excitedly. \"Don\u0027t tell me. It\u0027s James!\" \n Bond laughed. \"Well I\u0027m damned! It\u0027s Goodnight! What the hell are you doing here?\" \n \"More or less what I used to do for you. I heard you were back, but I thought you were ill or something. How absolutely marvellous! But where are you talking from?\" \n \"Kingston Airport. Now listen, darling. I need help. We can talk later. Can you get cracking?\" \n \"Of course. Wait till I get a pencil. Right.\" \n \"First I need a car. Anything that\u0027ll go. Then I want the name of the top man at Frome, you know, the WISCO estate beyond Savannah La Mar. Large-scale survey map of that area, a hundred pounds in Jamaican money. Then be an angel and ring up Alexander\u0027s the auctioneers and find out anything you can about a property that\u0027s advertised in today\u0027s Gleaner. Say you\u0027re a prospective buyer. Three-and-a-half Love Lane. You\u0027ll see the details. Then I want you to come out to Morgan\u0027s Harbour where I\u0027m going in a minute, be staying the night there, and we\u0027ll have dinner and swop secrets until the dawn steals over the Blue Mountains. Can do?\" \n \"Of course. But that\u0027s a hell of a lot of secrets. What shall I wear?\" \n \"Something that\u0027s tight in the right places. Not too many buttons.\" \n She laughed. \"You\u0027ve established your identity. Now I\u0027ll get on with all this. See you about seven. \u0027Bye.\" \n Gasping for air, James Bond pushed his way out of the little sweatbox. He ran his handkerchief over his face and neck. He\u0027d be damned! Mary Goodnight, his darling secretary from the old days in the Double-O Section! At Headquarters they had said she was abroad. He hadn\u0027t asked any questions. Perhaps she had opted for a change when he had gone missing. Anyway, what a break! Now he\u0027d got an ally, someone he knew. Good old Gleaner! He got his bag from the Aeronaves de Mexico booth and went out and hailed a taxi and said \"Morgan\u0027s Harbour\" and sat back and let the air from the open windows begin to dry him. \n The romantic little hotel is on the site of Port Royal at the tip of the Palisadoes. The proprietor, an Englishman who had once been in Intelligence himself and who guessed what Bond\u0027s job was, was glad to see him. He showed Bond to a comfortable air-conditioned room with a view of the pool and the wide mirror of Kingston Harbour. He said, \"What is it this time? Cubans or smuggling? They\u0027re the popular targets these days.\" \n \"Just on my way through. Got any lobsters?\" \n \"Of course.\" \n \"Be a good chap and save two for dinner. Broiled with melted butter. And a pot of that ridiculously expensive foie gras of yours. All right?\" \n \"Wilco. Celebration? Champagne on the ice?\" \n \"Good idea. Now I must get a shower and some sleep. That Kingston Airports murder.\" \n James Bond awoke at six. At first he didn\u0027t know where he was. He lay and remembered. Sir James Molony had said that his memory would be sluggish for a while. The E.C.T. treatment at The Park, a discreet so-called \"convalescent home\" in a vast mansion in Kent, had been fierce. Twenty-four bashes at his brain from the black box in thirty days. After it was over, Sir James had confessed that, if he had been practising in America, he wouldn\u0027t have been allowed to administer more than eighteen. At first, Bond had been terrified at the sight of the box and of the two cathodes that would be cupped to each temple. He had heard that people undergoing shock treatment had to be strapped down, that their jerking, twitching bodies, impelled by the volts, often hurtled off the operating table. But that, it seemed, was old hat. Now there was the longed-for needle with the pentathol, and Sir James said there was no movement of the body when the current flashed through except a slight twitching of the eyelids. And the results had been miraculous. After the pleasant, quiet-spoken analyst had explained to him what had been done to him in Russia, and after he had passed through the mental agony of knowing what he had nearly done to M., the old fierce hatred of the K.G.B. and all its works had been reborn in him, and, six weeks after he had entered The Park, all he wanted was to get back at the people who had invaded his brain for their own murderous purposes. And then had come his physical rehabilitation and the inexplicable amount of gun practice he had had to do at the Maidstone police range. And then the day arrived when the Chief of Staff had come down and spent the day briefing Bond on his new assignment. The reason for the gun practice became clear. And the scribble of green ink wishing him luck -signed \"M.\"-boosted his spirits. Two days later he was ready to enjoy the excitement of the ride to London airport on his way across the world. \n Bond took another shower and dressed in shirt, slacks, and sandals and wandered over to the little bar on the waterfront and ordered a double Walker\u0027s deluxe bourbon on the rocks and watched the pelicans diving for their dinner. Then he had another drink with a water chaser to break it down and wondered about Three-and-a-half Love Lane and what the \"samples\" would consist of and how he would take Scaramanga. This had been worrying him since he had been given his orders. It was all very fine to be told to \"eliminate\" the man, but James Bond had never liked killing in cold blood and to provoke a draw against a man who was possibly the fastest gun in the world was suicide. Well, he would just have to see which way the cards fell. The first thing to do was to clean up his cover. The diplomatic passport he would leave with Goodnight. He would now be \"Mark Hazard\" of the \"Transworld Consortium,\" the splendidly vague title which could cover almost any kind of human activity. His business would have to be with the West Indian Sugar Company because that was the only business, apart from Kaiser Bauxite, that existed in the comparatively deserted western districts of Jamaica. And, at Negril, there was also the project for developing one of the most spectacular beaches in the world, beginning with the building of the Thunderbird Hotel. He could be a rich man looking around for a building site. If his hunch and the childish predictions of his horoscope were right, and he came up with Scaramanga at the romantic Love Lane address, it would be a question of playing it by ear. \n The prairie fire of the sunset raged briefly in the west and the molten sea cooled off into moonlit gunmetal. \n A naked arm smelling of Chanel Number 5 snaked round his neck and warm lips kissed the corner of his mouth. As he reached up to hold the arm where it was, a breathless voice said, \"Oh, James! I\u0027m sorry. I just had to! It\u0027s so wonderful to have you back.\" \n Bond put his hand under the soft chin and lifted up her mouth and kissed her full on the half-open lips. He said, \"Why didn\u0027t we ever think of doing that before, Goodnight? Three years with only that door between us! What must we have been thinking of?\" \n She stood away from him. The golden bell of hair fell back to embrace her neck. She hadn\u0027t changed. Still only the faintest trace of makeup, but now the face was golden with sunburn from which the wide-apart blue eyes, now ablaze with the moon, shone out with that challenging directness that had disconcerted him when they had argued over some office problem. Still the same glint of health over the good bones and the broad uninhibited smile from the full lips that, in repose, were so exciting. But now the clothes were different. Instead of the severe shirt and skirt of the days at Headquarters, she was wearing a single string of pearls and a one-piece short-skirted frock in the colour of a pink gin with a lot of bitters in it-the orangey-pink of the inside of a conch shell. It was all tight against the bosom and the hips. She smiled at his scrutiny. \"The buttons are down the back. This is standard uniform for a tropical Station.\" \n \"I can just see Q Branch dreaming it up. I suppose one of the pearls has a death pill in it.\" \n \"Of course. But I can\u0027t remember which. I\u0027ll just have to swallow the whole string. Can I have a daiquiri please instead?\" \n Bond gave the order. \"Sorry, Goodnight. My manners are slipping. I was dazzled. It\u0027s so tremendous finding you here. And I\u0027ve never seen you in your working clothes before. Now then, tell me the news. Where\u0027s Ross? How long have you been here? Have you managed to cope with all that junk I gave you?\" \n Her drink came. She sipped it carefully. Bond remembered that she rarely drank and didn\u0027t smoke. He ordered another for himself and felt vaguely guilty that this was his third double and that she wouldn\u0027t know it and when it came wouldn\u0027t recognize it as a double. He lit a cigarette. Nowadays he was trying to keep to twenty and failing by about five. He stabbed the cigarette out. He was getting near to his target, and the rigid training rules that had been drilled into him at The Park must from now on be observed meticulously. The champagne wouldn\u0027t count. He was amused by the conscience this girl had awakened in him. He was also surprised and impressed. \n Mary Goodnight knew that the last question was the one he would want answered first. She reached into a plain straw handbag on a gold metal chain and handed him a thick envelope. She said, \"Mostly in used singles. A few fivers. Shall I debit you direct or put it in as expenses?\" \"Direct please.\" \n \"The top man at Frome is Tony Hugill. Nice man. Nice wife. Nice children. We\u0027ve had a lot to do with him, so he\u0027ll be friendly. He was in Naval Intelligence during the war, sort of commando job, so he knows the score. Does a good job-Frome produces about a quarter of Jamaica\u0027s sugar output-but Hurricane Flora and the tremendous rains we\u0027ve been having here have delayed the crop. Besides that, he\u0027s having a lot of trouble with cane burning and other small sabotage-mostly with thermite bombs brought in from Cuba. Jamaica\u0027s sugar is competition for Castro, you see. And with Flora and all the rains, the Cuban crop is going to be only about three million tons this year, compared with a Batista level of about seven-and very late because the rains have played havoc with the sucrose content.\" \n She smiled her wide smile. \"No secrets. Just reading the Gleaner. I don\u0027t understand it all, but apparently, because there\u0027s a tremendous chess game going on all over the world in sugar-in what they call sugar futures, that\u0027s sort of buying the stuff forward for delivery dates later in the year. Washington\u0027s trying to keep the price down, to upset Cuba\u0027s economy, and Castro\u0027s out to keep the world price up so that he can bargain with Russia. So it\u0027s worth Castro\u0027s trouble to do as much damage as possible to rival sugar crops. He\u0027s only got his sugar to sell and he wants food badly. This wheat the Americans are selling to Russia. A lot of that will find its way back to Cuba, in exchange for sugar, to feed the Cuban sugar croppers.\" She smiled again. \n \"Pretty daft business, isn\u0027t it? I don\u0027t think Castro can hold out much longer. The missile business in Cuba must have cost Russia about a billion pounds. And now they\u0027re having to pour money into Cuba, money and goods, to keep the place on its feet. I can\u0027t help thinking they\u0027ll pull out soon and leave Castro to go the way Batista went. It\u0027s a fiercely Catholic country, and Hurricane Flora was considered as the final judgment from heaven. It sat over the island and simply whipped it, day after day, for five days. No hurricane in history has ever behaved like that. The churchgoers don\u0027t miss an omen like that. It was a straight indictment of the regime.\" \n Bond said with admiration, \"Goodnight, you\u0027re a treasure. You\u0027ve certainly been doing your homework.\" \n The direct blue eyes looked straight into his, dodging the compliment. \"This is the stuff I live with here. It\u0027s built into the Station. But I thought you might like some background to Frome, and what I\u0027ve said explains why WISCO are getting these cane fires. At least we think it is. She took a sip of her drink. \"Well, that\u0027s all about sugar. The car\u0027s outside. You remember Strangways? Well, it\u0027s his old Sunbeam Alpine. The Station bought it, and now I use it. It\u0027s a bit aged, but it\u0027s still pretty fast and it won\u0027t let you down. It\u0027s rather bashed about, so it won\u0027t be conspicuous. The tank\u0027s full, and I\u0027ve put the survey map in the glove compartment.\" \n \"That\u0027s fine. Now, last question and then we\u0027ll go and have dinner and tell each other our life stories. But, by the way, what\u0027s happened to your chief, Ross?\" \n Mary Goodnight looked worried. \"To tell you the truth, I don\u0027t exactly know. He went off last week on some job to Trinidad. It was to try and locate a man called Scara-manga. He\u0027s a local gunman of some sort. I don\u0027t know much about him. Apparently Headquarters wants him traced for some reason.\" She smiled ruefully. \"Nobody ever tells me anything that\u0027s interesting. I just do the donkey work. Well, Commander Ross was due back two days ago and he hasn\u0027t turned up. I\u0027ve had to send off a Red Warning, but I\u0027ve been told to give him another week.\" \n \"Well, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s out of the way. I\u0027d rather have his Number Two. Last question. What about this three-and-one-half Love Lane? Did you get anywhere?\" \n Mary Goodnight blushed. \"Did I not! That was a fine question to get me mixed up with. Alexander\u0027s was noncommittal, and I finally had to go to the Special Branch. I shan\u0027t be able to show my face there for weeks. Heaven knows what they must think of you. That place is a, is a, er\"-she wrinkled her nose-\"it\u0027s a famous disorderly house in Sav\u0027 La Mar.\" \n Bond laughed out loud at her discomfiture. He teased her with malicious but gentle sadism. \"You mean it\u0027s a whorehouse?\" \n \"James! For heaven\u0027s sake! Must you be so crude?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579/46888.html","bookId":1270,"book":{"id":1270,"title":"007之金枪人 The Man With The Golden Gun","description":"简介： 讲述了007与绰号金枪人的职业杀手之间的对抗。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/14/09-51-58-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
