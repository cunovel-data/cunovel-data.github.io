{"id":38749,"no":1,"title":"1 \"Can I Help You?\"","content":"\n \n The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organization. Only M. and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as The War Book so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors. \n One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn\u0027t know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise-drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination. \n On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cogwheels in motion. \n The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to hold and said to her neighbour, \"It\u0027s another nut who says he\u0027s James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M. personally.\" \n The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond\u0027s death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond on Uranus, where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, \"Put him through to Liaison, Pat.\" \n The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: \"Just a moment, sir. I\u0027ll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.\" \n James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, \"Thank you.\" \n He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming \"Colonel Boris\" who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man\u0027s voice came on the line. \"Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?\" , \n James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. \"This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M., or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.\" \n Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know either of these two people. Are you sure you\u0027ve got the right number?\" \n James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director. \n \"Yes,\" said Captain Walker sympathetically. \"We seem to have got that part of it right. But I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr. Em, for instance. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve got anyone of that name at the Ministry.\" \n \"Do you want me to spell it out? You realize this is an open line?\" \n Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker\u0027s voice. He pressed another button, and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, \"Hang on a moment, would you? There\u0027s someone on my other line.\" Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. \"Sorry, sir. I\u0027ve got a chap on who says he\u0027s James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I\u0027ve gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.\" \n Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said \"Blast!\" and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now live to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself \"James Bond.\" Captain Walker\u0027s voice came over at full strength. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Now then. This man Mr. Em you want to talk to. I\u0027m sure we needn\u0027t worry about security. Could you be more specific?\" \n James Bond frowned. He didn\u0027t know that he had frowned, and he wouldn\u0027t have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, \"Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff\u0027s name? No? Well, let\u0027s see, it\u0027s Wednesday. Shall I tell you what\u0027ll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.\" \n The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond, \"Damn! There\u0027s the other telephone again. Shan\u0027t be a minute.\" He picked up the green telephone. \"Yes, sir?\" \n \"I don\u0027t like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007\u0027s death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The stone-face act. It\u0027s just possible. Keep me informed, would you?\" \n Captain Walker got back to James Bond. \"Sorry about that. It\u0027s being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can\u0027t help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It\u0027s number forty-four Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I\u0027ll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?\" \n James Bond said dully, \"That\u0027s very kind of you.\" He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number. \n James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond\u0027s file in the K.G.B. Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the K.G.B. image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the newsstand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a Canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance, and in due course the same van followed Bond\u0027s taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch. \n Number forty-four Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organization, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. \n The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the Canonflex film went on in its interior. \n \"Appointment with Major Townsend,\" said Bond. \n \"Yes. He\u0027s expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?\" The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coat hanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely closeted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. \"Would you follow me, sir?\" \n It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended intwo facing doors marked \"A\" and \"B.\" The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter. \n It was a pleasant, very light room, close-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece, which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames-one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfortable club chairs on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand. \n This was the Soft Man. \n \"Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.\" \n Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark-a reference to Bond\u0027s liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond\u0027s apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight. Major Townsend said, \"Well now. How can I help you?\" \n Across the corridor, in Room A-a cold Office of Works cube, equipped only with a hissing gas fire, an ugly desk under a naked neon light, and two wooden chairs- Bond\u0027s reception by the Hard Man, an ex-police superintendent (\"ex\" because of a brutality case in Glasgow for which he had taken the rap) would have been very different. There, the man who went under the name of Mr. Rob-son would have given him the full intimidation treatment -harsh, bullying interrogation, threats of imprisonment for false representation, and God knows what else, and, perhaps, if he had shown signs of hostility or developing a nuisance value, a little judicious roughing-up in the basement. \n Such was the ultimate sieve which sorted out the wheat from the chaff from among those members of the public who desired access to the Secret Service. There were other people in the building who dealt with the letters. Those written in pencil or in multicoloured inks, and those enclosing a photograph, remained unanswered. Those which threatened or were litigious were referred to the Special Branch. The solid, serious ones were passed, with a comment from the best graphologist in the business, to the Liaison Section at Headquarters for \"further action.\" Parcels went automatically, and fast, to the Bomb Disposal Squad at Knightsbridge Barracks. The eye of the needle was narrow. On the whole, it discriminated appropriately. It was an expensive setup, but it is the first duty of a secret service to remain not only secret but secure. \n There was no reason why James Bond, who had always been on the operative side of the business, should know anything about the entrails of the service, any more than he should have understood the mysteries of the plumbing or electricity supply of his flat in Chelsea or the working of his own kidneys. Colonel Boris, however, had known the whole routine. The secret services of all the great powers know the public face of their opponents, and Colonel Boris had very accurately described the treatment that James Bond must expect before he was cleared and was allowed access to the office of his former chief. \n So now James Bond paused before he replied to Major Townsend\u0027s question about how he could be of help. He looked at the Soft Man and then into the fire. He added up the accuracy of the description he had been given of Major Townsend\u0027s appearance, and before he said what he had been told to say, he gave Colonel Boris ninety out of a hundred. The big, friendly face, the wide-apart, pale-brown eyes, bracketed by the wrinkles of a million smiles, the military moustache, the rimless monocle dangling from a thin black cord, the brushed-back, thinning sandy hair, the immaculate double-breasted blue suit, stiff white collar and brigade tie-it was all there. But what Colonel Boris hadn\u0027t said was that the friendly eyes were as cold and steady as gunbarrels and that the lips were thin and scholarly. \n James Bond said patiently: \"It\u0027s really quite simple. I\u0027m who I say I am. I\u0027m doing what I naturally would do, and that\u0027s report back to M.\" \n \"Quite. But you must realize\"-a sympathetic smile- \"that you\u0027ve been out of contact for nearly a year. You\u0027ve been officially posted as \u0027missing believed killed.\u0027 Your obituary has even appeared in The Times, Have you any evidence of identity? I admit that you look very much like your photographs, but you must see that we have to be very sure before we pass you on up the ladder.\" \n \"A Miss Mary Goodnight was my secretary. She\u0027d recognize me all right. So would dozens of other people at H.Q.\" \n \"Miss Goodnight\u0027s been posted abroad. Can you give me a brief description of H.Q., just the main geography?\" \n Bond did so. \n \"Right. Now, who was a Miss Maria Freudenstadt?\" \n \"Was?\" \n \"Yes, she\u0027s dead.\" \n \"Thought she wouldn\u0027t last long. She was a double, working for K.G.B. Section One Hundred controlled her. I wouldn\u0027t get any thanks for telling you any more.\" \n Major Townsend had been pruned with this very secret top question. He had been given the answer, more or less as Bond had put it. This was the clincher. This had to be James Bond. \"Well, we\u0027re getting on fine. Now, it only remains to find out where you\u0027ve come from and where you\u0027ve been all these months and I won\u0027t keep you any longer.\" \n \"Sorry. I can only tell that to M. personally.\" \n \"I see.\" Major Townsend put on a thoughtful expression. \"Well, just let me make a telephone call or two and I\u0027ll see what can be done.\" He got to his feet. \"Seen today\u0027s Times?\" He picked it up and handed it to Bond. It had been specially treated to give good prints. Bond took it. \"Shan\u0027t be long.\" \n Major Townsend shut the door behind him and went across the passage and through the door marked \"A,\" where he knew that \"Mr. Robson\" would be alone. \"Sorry to bother you, Fred. Can I use your scrambler?\" The chunky man behind the desk grunted through the stem of his pipe and remained bent over the midday Evening Standard racing news. \n Major Townsend picked up the green receiver and was put through to the laboratory. \"Major Townsend speaking. Any comment?\" He listened, carefully, said thank you, and got through to the Chief Security Officer at Headquarters. \"Well, sir, I think it must be 007. Bit thinner than his photographs. I\u0027ll be giving you his prints as soon as he\u0027s gone. Wearing his usual rig-dark-blue single-breasted suit, white shirt, thin black knitted silk tie, black casuals- but they all look brand-new. Raincoat bought yesterday from Burberry\u0027s. Got the Freudenstadt question right, but says he won\u0027t say anything about himself except to M. personally. But whoever he is, I don\u0027t like it much. He fluffed on his special cigarettes. He\u0027s got an odd sort of glazed, sort of faraway look, and the \u0027scope\u0027 shows that he\u0027s carrying a gun inhis right-hand coat pocket-curious sort of contraption, doesn\u0027t seem to have got a butt to it. I\u0027d say he\u0027s a sick man. I wouldn\u0027t personally recommend that M. should see him, but I wouldn\u0027t know how we\u0027re to get him to talk unless he does.\" He paused. \"Very good, sir. I\u0027ll stay by the telephone. I\u0027m on Mr. Robson\u0027s extension.\" \n There was silence in the room. The two men didn\u0027t get on well together. Major Townsend gazed into the gas fire, wondering about the man next door. The telephone burred. \"Yes, sir? Very good, sir. Would your secretary send along a car from the pool? Thank you, sir.\" \n Bond was sitting in the same upright posture, The Times still unopened in his hand. Major Townsend said cheerfully, \"Well, that\u0027s fixed. Message from M. that he\u0027s tremendously relieved you\u0027re all right and he\u0027ll be free in about half an hour. Car should be here in ten minutes or so. And the Chief of Staff says he hopes you\u0027ll be free for lunch afterwards.\" \n James Bond smiled for the first time. It was a thin smile which didn\u0027t light up his eyes. He said, \"That\u0027s very kind of nun. Would you tell him I\u0027m afraid I shan\u0027t be free.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579/46885.html","bookId":1270,"book":{"id":1270,"title":"007之金枪人 The Man With The Golden Gun","description":"简介： 讲述了007与绰号金枪人的职业杀手之间的对抗。...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/14/09-51-58-41-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1579","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
