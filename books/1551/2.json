{"id":107661,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"A battered black Peugeot 403 broke out of the centre stream of traffic, cut across the inside line of cars and pulled in to double park at the kerb. There was the usual screaming of brakes, hooting and yelling. Quite unmoved, a girl got out of the car and, leaving the traffic to sort itself out, walked purposefully across the sidewalk. Bond sat up. She had everything, but absolutely everything that belonged in his fantasy. She was tall and, although her figure was hidden by a light raincoat, the way she moved and the way she held herself promised that it would be beautiful. The face had the gaiety and bravado that went with her driving, but now there was impatience in the compressed lips and the eyes fretted as she pushed diagonally through the moving crowd on the pavement. Bond watched her narrowly as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle. Of course it was hopeless. She was coming to meet someone - her lover. She was the sort of woman who always belongs to somebody else. She was late for him. That\u0027s why she was in such a hurry. What damnable luck - right down to the long blonde hair under the rakish beret! And she was looking straight at him. She was smiling . . . ! Before Bond could pull himself together, the girl had come up to his table and had drawn out a chair and sat down. She smiled rather tautly into his startled eyes. “I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late, and I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve got to get moving at once. You\u0027re wanted at the office.” She added under her breath: “Crash dive.” Bond jerked himself back to reality. Whoever she was, she was certainly from \u0027the firm\u0027. \u0027Crash dive\u0027 was a slang expression the Secret Service had borrowed from the Submarine Service. It meant bad news - the worst. Bond dug into his pocket and slid some coins over the table. He said “Right. Let\u0027s go,” and got up and followed her down through the tables and across to her car. It was still obstructing the inner lane of traffic. Any minute now there would be a policeman. Angry faces glared at them as they climbed in. The girl had left the engine running. She banged the gears into second and slid out into the traffic. Bond looked sideways at her. The pale skin was velvet. The blonde hair was silk - to the roots. He said: “Where are you from and what\u0027s it all about?” She said, concentrating on the traffic: “From the Station. Grade two assistant. Number 765 on duty, Mary Ann Russell off. I\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s all about. I just saw the signal from HQ - personal from M to Head of Station. Most Immediate and all that. He was to find you at once and if necessary use the DeuxiŠme to help. Head of F said you always went to the same places when you were in Paris, and I and another girl were given a list.” She smiled. “I\u0027d only tried Harry\u0027s Bar, and after Fouquet\u0027s I was going to start on the restaurants. It was marvellous picking you up like that.” She gave him a quick glance. “I hope I wasn\u0027t very clumsy.” Bond said: “You were fine. How were you going to handle it if I\u0027d had a girl with me?” She laughed. “I was going to do much the same except call you \u0027sir\u0027. I was only worried about how you\u0027d dispose of the girl. If she started a scene I was going to offer to take her home in my car and for you to take a taxi.” “You sound pretty resourceful. How long have you been in the Service?” “Five years. This is my first time with a Station.” “How do you like it?” “I like the work all right. The evenings and days off drag a bit. It\u0027s not easy to make friends in Paris without” - her mouth turned down with irony - “without all the rest. I mean,” she hastened to add, “I\u0027m not a prude and all that, but somehow the French make the whole business such a bore. I mean I\u0027ve had to give up taking the Metro or buses. Whatever time of day it is, you end up with your behind black and blue.” She laughed. “Apart from the boredom of it and not knowing what to say to the man, some of the pinches really hurt. It\u0027s the limit. So to get around I bought this car cheap, and other cars seem to keep out of my way. As long as you don\u0027t catch the other driver\u0027s eye, you can take on even the meanest of them. They\u0027re afraid you haven\u0027t seen them. And they\u0027re worried by the bashed-about look of the car. They give you a wide berth.” They had come to the Rond Point. As if to demonstrate her theory, she tore round it and went straight at the line of traffic coming up from the Place de la Concorde. Miraculously it divided and let her through into the Avenue Matignon. Bond said: “Pretty good. But don\u0027t make it a habit. There may be some French Mary Anns about.” She laughed. She turned into the Avenue Gabrielle and pulled up outside the Paris headquarters of the Secret Service: “I only try that sort of manouvre in the line of duty.” Bond got out and came round to her side of the car. He said: “Well, thanks for picking me up. When this whirl is over, can I pick you up in exchange? I don\u0027t get the pinches, but I\u0027m just as bored in Paris as you are.” Her eyes were blue and wide apart. They searched his. She said seriously: “I\u0027d like that. The switchboard here can always find me.” Bond reached in through the window and pressed the hand on the wheel. He said “Good,” and turned and walked quickly in through the archway. Wing Commander Rattray, Head of Station F, was a fattish man with pink cheeks and fair hair brushed straight back. He dressed in a mannered fashion with turned-back cuffs and double slits to his coat, bow-ties and fancy waistcoats. He made a good-living, wine-and-food-society impression in which only the slow, rather cunning blue eyes struck a false note. He chain-smoked Gauloises and his office stank of them. He greeted Bond with relief. “Who found you?” “Russell. At Fouquet\u0027s. Is she new?” “Six months. She\u0027s a good one. But take a pew. There\u0027s the hell of a flap on and I\u0027ve got to brief you and get you going.” He bent to his intercom and pressed down a switch. “Signal to M, please. Personal from Head of Station. \u0027Located 007 briefing now.\u0027 Okay?” He let go the switch. Bond pulled a chair over by the open window to keep away from the fog of Gauloises. The traffic on the Champs-Elys‚es was a soft roar in the background. Half an hour before he had been fed up with Paris, glad to be going. Now he hoped he would be staying. Head of F said: “Somebody got our dawn dispatch-rider from SHAPE to the St Germain Station yesterday morning. The weekly run from the SHAPE Intelligence Division with the Summaries, Joint Intelligence papers, Iron Curtain Order of Battle - all the top gen. One shot in the back. Took his dispatch-case and his wallet and watch.” Bond said: “That\u0027s bad. No chance that it was an ordinary hold-up? Or do they think the wallet and watch were cover?” “SHAPE Security can\u0027t make up their minds. On the whole they guess it was cover. Seven o\u0027clock in the morning\u0027s a rum time for a hold-up. But you can argue it out with them when you get down there. M\u0027s sending you as his personal representative. He\u0027s worried as hell. Apart from the loss of the Intelligence dope, their I. people have never liked having one of our Stations outside the Reservation so to speak. For years they\u0027ve been trying to get the St Germain unit incorporated in the SHAPE Intelligence set-up. But you know what M is, independent old devil. He\u0027s never been happy about NATO Security. Why, right in the SHAPE Intelligence Division there are not only a couple of Frenchmen and an Italian, but the head of their Counter Intelligence and Security section is a German!” Bond whistled. “The trouble is that this damnable business is all SHAPE needs to bring M to heel. Anyway, he says you\u0027re to get down there right away. I\u0027ve fixed up clearance for you. Got the passes. You\u0027re to report to Colonel Schreiber, Headquarters Command Security Branch. American. Efficient chap. He\u0027s been handling the thing from the beginning. As far as I can gather, he\u0027s already done just about all there was to be done.” “What\u0027s he done? What actually happened?” Head of F picked up a map from his desk and walked over with it. It was the big-scale Michelin Environs de Paris. He pointed with a pencil. “Here\u0027s Versailles, and here, just north of the park, is the big junction of the Paris-Mantes and the Versailles autoroutes. A couple of hundred yards north of that, on N184, is SHAPE. Every Wednesday, at seven in the morning, a Special Services dispatch-rider leaves SHAPE with the weekly Intelligence stuff I told you about. He has to get to this little village called Fourqueux, just outside St Germain, deliver his stuff to the duty officer at our HQ, and report back to SHAPE by seven-thirty. Rather than go through all this built-up area, for security reasons his orders are to take this N307 to St Nom, turn right-handed on to D98 and go under the autoroute and through the forest of St Germain. The distance is about twelve kilometres, and taking it easy he\u0027ll do the trip in under a quarter of an hour. Well, yesterday it was a corporal from the Corps of Signals, good solid man called Bates, and when he hadn\u0027t reported back to SHAPE by seven-forty-five they sent another rider to look for him. Not a trace, and he hadn\u0027t reported at our HQ. By eight-fifteen the Security Branch was on the job, and by nine the roadblocks were up. The police and the DeuxiŠme were told and search parties got under way. The dogs found him, but not till the evening around six, and by that time if there had been any clues on the road they\u0027d have been wiped out by the traffic.” Head of F handed the map to Bond and walked back to his desk. “And that\u0027s about the lot, except that all the usual steps have been taken - frontiers, ports, aerodromes and so forth. But that sort of thing won\u0027t help. If it was a professional job, whoever did it could have had the stuff out of the country by midday or into an embassy in Paris inside an hour.” Bond said impatiently: “Exactly! And so what the hell does M expect me to do? Tell SHAPE Security to do it all over again, but better? This sort of thing isn\u0027t my line at all. Bloody waste of time.” Head of F smiled sympathetically. “Matter of fact I put much the same point of view to M over the scrambler. Tactfully. The old man was quite reasonable. Said he wanted to show SHAPE he was taking the business just as seriously as they were. You happened to be available and more or less on the spot, and he said you had the sort of mind that might pick up the invisible factor. I asked him what he meant, and he said that at all closely guarded headquarters there\u0027s bound to be an invisible man - a man everyone takes so much for granted that he just isn\u0027t noticed - gardener, window cleaner, postman. I said that SHAPE had thought of that, and that all those sort of jobs were done by enlisted men. M told me not to be so literal-minded and hung up.” Bond laughed. He could see M\u0027s frown and hear the crusty voice. He said: “All right, then. I\u0027ll see what I can do. Who do I report back to?” “Here. M doesn\u0027t want the St Germain unit to get involved. Anything you have to say I\u0027ll put straight on the printer to London. But I may not be available when you call up. I\u0027ll make someone your duty officer and you\u0027ll be able to get them any time in the twenty-four hours. Russell can do it. She picked you up. She might as well carry you. Suit you?” “Yes,” said Bond. “That\u0027ll be all right.” The battered Peugeot, commandeered by Rattray, smelled of her. There were bits of her in the glove compartment - half a packet of Suchard milk chocolate, a twist of paper containing bobby pins, a paperback John O\u0027Hara, a single black suede glove. Bond thought about her as far as the Etoile and then closed his mind to her and pushed the car along fast through the Bois. Rattray had said it would take about fifteen minutes at fifty. Bond said to halve the speed and double the time and to tell Colonel Schreiber that he would be with him by nine-thirty. After the Porte de St Cloud there was little traffic, and Bond held seventy on the autoroute until the second exit road came up on his right and there was the red arrow for SHAPE. Bond turned up the slope and on to N184. Two hundred yards farther, in the centre of the road, was the traffic policeman Bond had been told to look out for. The policeman waved him in through the big gates on the left and he pulled up at the first checkpoint. A grey-uniformed American policeman hung out of his cabin and glanced at his pass. He was told to pull inside and hold it. Now a French policeman took his pass, noted the details on a printed form clipped to a board, gave him a large plastic windscreen number and waved him on. As Bond pulled in to the car park, with theatrical suddenness a hundred arc-lights blazed and lit up the acre of low-lying hutments in front of him as if it was day. Feeling naked, Bond walked across the open gravel beneath the flags of the NATO countries and ran up the four shallow steps to the wide glass doors that gave entrance to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Forces Europe. Now there was the main Security desk. American and French military police checked his pass and noted the details. He was handed over to a red-capped British MP and led off down the main corridor past endless office doors. They bore no names but the usual alphabetical abracadabra of all headquarters. One said COMSTRIKFLTLANT AND SACLANT LIAISON TO SACEUR. Bond asked what it meant. The military policeman, either ignorant or, more probably, security-minded, said stolidly: “Couldn\u0027t rightly say, sir.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8/page-2.html","bookId":1551,"book":{"id":1551,"title":"For Your Eyes Only (James Bond #8)","description":"Storyline: For Your Eyes Only (James Bond (Original Series) #8) \"Bond watched her as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle.
