Scotland Yard stuff mostly - their narcotics people. Wads from the Home Office and the Ministry of Health, and some nice thick reports from the International Opium Control people in Geneva. Take it away and read it. You\u0027ll need today and most of tonight. Tomorrow you fly to Rome and get after the big men. Is that clear?” Bond said that it was. The state of M\u0027s temper was also explained. There was nothing that made him more angry than having to divert his staff from their primary duty. This duty was espionage, and when necessary sabotage and subversion. Anything else was a misuse of the Service and of Secret Funds which, God knows, were meagre enough. “Any questions?” M\u0027s jaw stuck out like the prow of a ship. The jaw seemed to tell Bond to pick up the files and get the hell out of the office and let M move on to something important. Bond knew that a part of all this - if only a small part - was an act. M had certain bees in his bonnet. They were famous in the Service, and M knew they were. But that did not mean that he would allow them to stop buzzing. There were queen bees, like the misuse of the Service, and the search for true as distinct from wishful intelligence, and there were worker bees. These included such idiosyncrasies as not employing men with beards, or those who were completely bilingual, instantly dismissing men who tried to bring pressure to bear on him through family relationships with members of the Cabinet, mistrusting men or women who were too \u0027dressy\u0027, and those who called him \u0027sir\u0027 off-duty; and having an exaggerated faith in Scotsmen. But M was ironically conscious of his obsessions, as, thought Bond, a Churchill or a Montgomery were about theirs. He never minded his bluff, as it partly was, being called on any of them. Moreover, he would never have dreamed of sending Bond out on an assignment without proper briefing. Bond knew all this. He said mildly: “Two things, sir. Why are we taking this thing on, and what lead, if any, have Station I got towards the people involved in it?” M gave Bond a hard, sour look. He swivelled his chair sideways so that he could watch the high, scudding October clouds through the broad window. He reached out for his pipe, blew through it sharply, and then, as if this action had let off the small head of steam, replaced it gently on the desk. When he spoke, his voice was patient, reasonable. “As you can imagine, 007, I do not wish the Service to become involved in this drug business. Earlier this year I had to take you off other duties for a fortnight so that you could go to Mexico and chase off that Mexican grower. You nearly got yourself killed. I sent you as a favour to the Special Branch. When they asked for you again to tackle this Italian gang I refused. Ronnie Vallance went behind my back to the Home Office and the Ministry of Health. The Ministers pressed me. I said that you were needed here and that I had no one else to spare. Then the two Ministers went to the PM.” M paused. “And that was that. I must say the PM was very persuasive. Took the line that heroin, in the quantities that have been coming in, is an instrument of psychological warfare - that it saps a country\u0027s strength. He said he wouldn\u0027t be surprised to find that this wasn\u0027t just a gang of Italians\u0027 out to make big money - that subversion and not money was at the back of it.” M smiled sourly. “I expect Ronnie Vallance thought up that line of argument. Apparently his narcotics people have been having the devil of a time with the traffic - trying to stop it getting a hold on the teenagers as it has in America. Seems the dance halls and the amusement arcades are full of pedlars. Vallance\u0027s Ghost Squad have managed to penetrate back up the line to one of the middle-men, and there\u0027s no doubt it\u0027s all coming from Italy, hidden in Italian tourists\u0027 cars. Vallance has done what he can through the Italian police and Interpol, and got nowhere. They get so far back up the pipeline, arrest a few little people, and then, when they seem to be getting near the centre, there\u0027s a blank wall. The inner ring of distributors are too frightened or too well paid.” Bond interrupted. “Perhaps there\u0027s protection somewhere, sir. That Montesi business didn\u0027t look so good.” M shrugged impatiently. “Maybe, maybe. And you\u0027ll have to watch out for that too, but my impression is that the Montesi case resulted in a pretty extensive clean-up. Anyway, when the PM gave me the order to get on with it, it occurred to me to have a talk with Washington. CIA were very helpful. You know the Narcotics Bureau have a team in Italy. Have had ever since the War. They\u0027re nothing to do with CIA - run by the American Treasury Department, of all people. The American Treasury control a so-called Secret Service that looks after drug smuggling and counterfeiting. Pretty crazy arrangement. Often wonder what the FBI must think of it. However,” M slowly swivelled his chair away from the window. He linked his hands behind his head and leaned back, looking across the desk at Bond. “The point is that the CIA Rome Station works pretty closely with this little narcotics team. Has to, to prevent crossed lines and so on. And CIA - Alan Dulles himself, as a matter of fact - gave me the name of the top narcotics agent used by the Bureau. Apparently he\u0027s a double. Does a little smuggling as cover. Chap called Kristatos. Dulles said that of course he couldn\u0027t involve his people in any way and he was pretty certain the Treasury Department wouldn\u0027t welcome their Rome Bureau playing too closely with us. But he said that, if I wished, he would get word to this Kristatos that one of our, er, best men would like to make contact with a view to doing business. I said I would much appreciate that, and yesterday I got word that the rendezvous is fixed for the day after tomorrow.” M gestured towards the files in front of Bond. “You\u0027ll find all the details in there.” There was a brief silence in the room. Bond was thinking that the whole affair sounded unpleasant probably dangerous and certainly dirty. With the last quality in mind, Bond got to his feet and picked up the files. “All right, sir. It looks like money. How much will we pay for the traffic to stop?” M let his chair tip forward. He put his hands flat down on the desk, side by side. He said roughly: “A hundred thousand pounds. In any currency. That\u0027s the PM\u0027s figure. But I don\u0027t want you to get hurt. Certainly not picking other people\u0027s coals out of the fire. So you can go up to another hundred thousand if there\u0027s bad trouble. Drugs are the biggest and tightest ring in crime.” M reached for his in-basket and took out a file of signals. Without looking up he said: “Look after yourself.” Signor Kristatos picked up the menu. He said: “I do not beat about bushes, Mr Bond. How much?” “Fifty thousand pounds for one hundred per cent results.” Kristatos said indifferently: “Yes. Those are important funds. I shall have melon with prosciutto ham and a chocolate ice-cream. I do not eat greatly at night. These people have their own Chianti. I commend it.” The waiter came and there was a brisk rattle of Italian. Bond ordered Tagliatelli Verdi with a Genoese sauce which Kristatos said was improbably concocted of basil, garlic and fir cones. When the waiter had gone, Kristatos sat and chewed silently on a wooden toothpick. His face gradually became dark and glum as if bad weather had come to his mind. The black, hard eyes that glanced restlessly at everything in the restaurant except Bond, glittered. Bond guessed that Kristatos was wondering whether or not to betray somebody. Bond said encouragingly: “In certain circumstances, there might be more.” Kristatos seemed to make up his mind. He said: “So?” He pushed back his chair and got up. “Forgive me. I must visit the toiletta.” He turned and walked swiftly towards the back of the restaurant. Bond was suddenly hungrier and thirsty. He poured out a large glass of Chianti and swallowed half of it. He broke a roll and began eating, smothering each mouthful with deep yellow butter. He wondered why rolls and butter are delicious only in France and Italy. There was nothing else on his mind. It was just a question of waiting. He had confidence in Kristatos. He was a big, solid man who was trusted by the Americans. He was probably making some telephone call that would be decisive. Bond felt in good spirits. He watched the passers-by through the plate-glass window. A man selling one of the Party papers went by on a bicycle. Flying from the basket in front of the handlebars was a pennant. In red on white it said: PROGRESSO? - SI! - AVVENTURI? - NO! Bond smiled. That was how it was. Let it so remain for the rest of the assignment. On the far side of the square, rather plain room, at the corner table by the caisse, the plump fair-haired girl with the dramatic mouth said to the jovial good-living man with the thick rope of spaghetti joining his face to the plate: “He has a rather cruel smile. But he is very handsome. Spies aren\u0027t usually so good-looking. Are you sure you are right, mein T„ubchen?” The man\u0027s teeth cut through the rope. He wiped his mouth on a napkin already streaked with tomato sauce, belched sonorously and said: “Santos is never wrong about these things. He has a nose for spies. That is why I chose him as the permanent tail for that bastard Kristatos. And who else but a spy would think of spending an evening with the pig? But we will make sure.” The man took out of his pocket one of those cheap tin snappers that are sometimes given out, with paper hats and whistles, on carnival nights. It gave one sharp click. The maŒtre d\u0027h“tel on the far side of the room stopped whatever he was doing and hurried over. “Si, padrone.” The man beckoned. The maŒtre d\u0027h“tel went over and received the whispered instructions. He nodded briefly, walked over to a door near the kitchens marked UFFICIO, and went in and closed the door behind him. Phase by phase, in a series of minute moves, an exercise that had long been perfected was then smoothly put into effect. The man near the caisse munched his spaghetti and critically observed each step in the operation as if it had been a fast game of chess. The maŒtre d\u0027h“tel came out of the door marked UFFICIO, hurried across the restaurant and said loudly to his No. 2: “An extra table for four. Immediately.” The No. 2 gave him a direct look and nodded. He followed the maŒtre d\u0027h“tel over to a space adjoining Bond\u0027s table, clicked his fingers for help, borrowed a chair from one table, a chair from another table and, with a bow and an apology, the spare chair from Bond\u0027s table. The fourth chair was being carried over from the direction of the door marked UFFICIO by the maŒtre d\u0027h“tel. He placed it square with the others, a table was lowered into the middle and glass and cutlery were deftly laid. The maŒtre d\u0027h“tel frowned. “But you have laid a table for four. I said three - for three people.” He casually took the chair he had himself brought to the table and switched it to Bond\u0027s table. He gave a wave of the hand to dismiss his helpers and everyone dispersed about their business. The innocent little flurry of restaurant movement had taken about a minute. An innocuous trio of Italians came into the restaurant. The maŒtre d\u0027h“tel greeted them personally and bowed them to the new table, and the gambit was completed. Bond had hardly been conscious of it. Kristatos returned from whatever business he had been about, their food came and they got on with the meal.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8/page-16.html","bookId":1551,"book":{"id":1551,"title":"For Your Eyes Only (James Bond #8)","description":"Storyline: For Your Eyes Only (James Bond (Original Series) #8) \"Bond watched her as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle.
