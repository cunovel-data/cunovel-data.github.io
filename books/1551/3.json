{"id":107662,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Behind a door that said Colonel G. A. Schreiber, Chief of Security, Headquarters Command, was a ramrod-straight, middle-aged American with greying hair and the politely negative manner of a bank manager. There were several family photographs in silver frames on his desk and a vase containing one white rose. There was no smell of tobacco smoke in the room. After cautiously amiable preliminaries, Bond congratulated the Colonel on his security. He said: “All these checks and double checks don\u0027t make it easy for the opposition. Have you ever lost anything before, or have you ever found signs of a serious attempt at a coup?”\\n\\n “No to both questions, Commander. I\u0027m quite satisfied about Headquarters. It\u0027s only the outlying units that worry me. Apart from this section of your Secret Service, we have various detached signal units. Then, of course, there are the Home Ministries of fourteen different nations. I can\u0027t answer for what may leak from those quarters.”\\n\\n “It can\u0027t be an easy job,” agreed Bond. “Now, about this mess. Has anything else come up since Wing Commander Rattray spoke to you last?”\\n\\n “Got the bullet. Luger. Severed the spinal cord. Probably fired at around thirty yards, give or take ten yards. Assuming our man was riding a straight course, the bullet must have been fired from dead astern on a level trajectory. Since it can\u0027t have been a man standing in the road, the killer must have been moving in or on some vehicle.”\\n\\n “So your man would have seen him in the driving-mirror?”\\n\\n “Probably.”\\n\\n “If your riders find themselves being followed, do they have any instructions about taking evasive action?”\\n\\n The Colonel smiled slightly. “Sure. They\u0027re told to go like hell.”\\n\\n “And at what speed did your man crash?”\\n\\n “Not fast, they think. Between twenty and forty. What are you getting at, Commander?”\\n\\n “I was wondering if you\u0027d decided whether it was a pro or an amateur job. If your man wasn\u0027t trying to get away, and assuming he saw the killer in his mirror, which I agree is only a probability, that suggests that he accepted the man on his tail as friend rather than foe. That could mean some sort of disguise that would fit in with the set-up here - something your man would accept even at that hour of the morning.”\\n\\n A small frown had been gathering across Colonel Schreiber\u0027s smooth forehead. “Commander,” there was an edge of tension in the voice, “we have, of course, been considering every angle of this case, including the one you mention. At midday yesterday the Commanding General declared emergency in this matter, standing security and security ops committees were set up, and from that moment on every angle, every hint of a clue, has been systematically run to earth. And I can tell you, Commander,” the Colonel raised one well-manicured hand and let it descend in soft emphasis on his blotting-pad, “any man who can come up with an even remotely original idea on this case will have to be closely related to Einstein. There is nothing, repeat nothing, to go on in this case whatsoever.”\\n\\n Bond smiled sympathetically. He got to his feet. “In that case, Colonel, I won\u0027t waste any more of your time this evening. If I could just have the minutes of the various meetings to bring myself up to date, and if one of your men could show me the way to the canteen and my quarters . . .”\\n\\n “Sure, sure.” The Colonel pressed a bell. A young crew-cutted aide came in. “Proctor, show the Commander to his room in the VIP wing, would you, and then take him along to the bar and the canteen.” He turned to Bond. “I\u0027ll have those papers ready for you after you\u0027ve had a meal and a drink. They\u0027ll be in my office. They can\u0027t be taken out, of course, but you\u0027ll find everything to hand next door, and Proctor will be able to fill you in on anything that\u0027s missing.” He held out his hand. “Okay? Then we\u0027ll meet again in the morning.”\\n\\n Bond said goodnight and followed the aide out. As he walked along the neutral-painted, neutral-smelling corridors, he reflected that this was probably the most hopeless assignment he had ever been on. If the top security brains of fourteen countries were stumped, what hope had he got? By the time he was in bed that night, in the Spartan luxury of the visitors\u0027 overnight quarters, Bond had decided he would give it a couple more days - largely for the sake of keeping in touch with Mary Ann Russell for as long as possible - and then chuck it. On this decision he fell immediately into a deep and untroubled sleep.\\n\\n Not two, but four days later, as the dawn came up over the Forest of St Germain, James Bond was lying along the thick branch of an oak tree keeping watch over a small empty glade that lay deep among the trees bordering D98, the road of the murder.\\n\\n He was dressed from head to foot in parachutists\u0027 camouflage - green, brown and black. Even his hands were covered with the stuff, and there was a hood over his head with slits cut for the eyes and mouth. It was good camouflage which would be still better when the sun was higher and the shadows blacker, and from anywhere on the ground, even directly below the high branch, he could not be seen.\\n\\n It had come about like this. The first two days at SHAPE had been the expected waste of time. Bond had achieved nothing except to make himself mildly unpopular with the persistence of his double-checking questions. On the morning of the third day he was about to go and say his goodbyes when he had a telephone call from the Colonel. “Oh, Commander, thought I\u0027d let you know that the last team of police dogs got in late last night - your idea that it might be worth while covering the whole forest. Sorry” - the voice sounded un-sorry - “but negative, absolutely negative.”\\n\\n “Oh. My fault for the wasted time.” As much to annoy the Colonel as anything, Bond said: “Mind if I have a talk with the handler?”\\n\\n “Sure, sure. Anything you want. By the way, Commander, how long are you planning to be around? Glad to have you with us for as long as you like. But it\u0027s a question of your room. Seems there\u0027s a big party coming in from Holland in a few days\u0027 time. Top level staff course or something of the kind, and Admin says they\u0027re a bit pushed for space.”\\n\\n Bond had not expected to get on well with Colonel Schreiber and he had not done so. He said amiably: “I\u0027ll see what my Chief has to say and call you back, Colonel.”\\n\\n “Do that, would you.” The Colonel\u0027s voice was equally polite, but the manners of both men were running out and the two receivers broke the line simultaneously.\\n\\n The chief handler was a Frenchman from the Landes. He had the quick sly eyes of a poacher. Bond met him at the kennels, but the handler\u0027s proximity was too much for the Alsatians and, to get away from the noise, he took Bond into the duty-room, a tiny office with binoculars hanging from pegs, and waterproofs, gumboots, dog-harness and other gear stacked round the walls. There were a couple of deal chairs and a table covered with a large-scale map of the Forest of St Germain. This had been marked off into pencilled squares. The handler made a gesture over the map. “Our dogs covered it all, Monsieur. There is nothing there.”\\n\\n “Do you mean to say they didn\u0027t check once?”\\n\\n The handler scratched his head. “We had trouble with a bit of game, Monsieur. There was a hare or two. A couple of foxes\u0027 earths. We had quite a time getting them away from a clearing near the Carrefour Royal. They probably still smelled the gipsies.”\\n\\n “Oh.” Bond was only mildly interested. “Show me. Who were these gipsies?”\\n\\n The handler pointed daintily with a grimy little finger. “These are the names from the old days. Here is the Etoile Parfaite, and here, where the killing took place, is the Carrefour des Curieux. And here, forming the bottom of the triangle, is the Carrefour Royal. It makes,” he added dramatically, “a cross with the road of death.” He took a pencil out of his pocket and made a dot just off the crossroads. “And this is the clearing, Monsieur. There was a gipsy caravan there for most of the winter. They left last month. Cleaned the place up all right, but, for the dogs, their scent will hang about there for months.”\\n\\n Bond thanked him, and after inspecting and admiring the dogs and making some small talk about the handler\u0027s profession, he got into the Peugeot and went off to the gendarmerie in St Germain. “Yes, certainly they had known the gipsies. Real Romany-looking fellows. Hardly spoke a word of French, but they had behaved themselves. There had been no complaints. Six men and two women. No. No one had seen them go. One morning they just weren\u0027t there any more. Might have been gone a week for all one knew. They had chosen an isolated spot.”\\n\\n Bond took the D98 through the forest. When the great autoroute bridge showed up a quarter of a mile ahead over the road, Bond accelerated and then switched off the engine and coasted silently until he came to the Carrefour Royal. He stopped and got out of the car without a sound, and, feeling rather foolish, softly entered the forest and walked with great circumspection towards where the clearing would be. Twenty yards inside the trees he came to it. He stood in the fringe of bushes and trees and examined it carefully. Then he walked in and went over it from end to end.\\n\\n The clearing was about as big as two tennis courts and floored in thick grass and moss. There was one large patch of lilies of the valley and, under the bordering trees, a scattering of bluebells. To one side there was a low mound, perhaps a tumulus, completely surrounded and covered with brambles and brier roses now thickly in bloom. Bond walked round this and gazed in among the roots, but there was nothing to see except the earthy shape of the mound.\\n\\n Bond took one last look round and then went to the corner of the clearing that would be nearest to the road. Here there was easy access through the trees. Were there traces of a path, a slight flattening of the leaves? Not more than would have been left by the gipsies or last year\u0027s picnickers. On the edge of the road there was a narrow passage between two trees. Casually Bond bent to examine the trunks. He stiffened and dropped to a crouch. With a fingernail, he delicately scraped away a narrow sliver of caked mud. It hid a deep scratch in the tree-trunk. He caught the scraps of mud in his free hand. He now spat and moistened the mud and carefully filled up the scratch again. There were three camouflaged scratches on one tree and four on the other. Bond walked quickly out of the trees on to the road. His car had stopped on a slight slope leading down under the autoroute bridge. Although there was some protection from the boom of the traffic on the autoroute, Bond pushed the car, jumped in and only engaged the gears when he was well under the bridge.\\n\\n And now Bond was back in the clearing, above it, and he still did not know if his hunch had been right. It had been M\u0027s dictum that had put him on the scent - if it was a scent - and the mention of the gipsies. “It was the gipsies the dogs smelled . . . Most of the winter . . . they went last month. No complaints . . . One morning they just weren\u0027t there any more.” The invisible factor. The invisible man. The people who are so much part of the background that you don\u0027t know if they\u0027re there or not. Six men and two girls and they hardly spoke a word of French. Good cover, gipsies. You could be a foreigner and yet not a foreigner, because you were only a gipsy. Some of them had gone off in the caravan. Had some of them stayed, built themselves a hide-out during the winter, a secret place from which the hijacking of the top secret dispatches had been the first sortie? Bond had thought he was building fantasies until he found the scratches, the carefully camouflaged scratches, on the two trees. They were just at the height where, if one was carrying any kind of a cycle, the pedals might catch against the bark. It could all be a pipedream, but it was good enough for Bond. The only question in his mind was whether these people had made a one-time-only coup or whether they were so confident of their security that they would try again. He confided only in Station F. Mary Ann Russell told him to be careful. Head of F, more constructively, ordered his unit at St Germain to co-operate. Bond said goodbye to Colonel Schreiber and moved to a camp bed in the unit\u0027s HQ - an anonymous house in an anonymous village back street. The unit had provided the camouflage outfit and the four Secret Service men who ran the unit had happily put themselves under Bond\u0027s orders. They realised as well as Bond did that if Bond managed to wipe the eye of the whole security machine of SHAPE, the Secret Service would have won a priceless feather in its cap vis-…-vis the SHAPE High Command, and M\u0027s worries over the independence of his unit would be gone for ever. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8/page-3.html","bookId":1551,"book":{"id":1551,"title":"For Your Eyes Only (James Bond #8)","description":"Storyline: For Your Eyes Only (James Bond (Original Series) #8) \\n \"Bond watched her as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle.
