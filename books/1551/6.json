{"id":107665,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Colonel Havelock put down his Gleaner. “I thought I heard a car.”\\n\\n Mrs Havelock said firmly: “If it\u0027s those ghastly Feddens from Port Antonio, you\u0027ve simply got to get rid of them. I can\u0027t stand any more of their moans about England. And last time they were both quite drunk when they left and dinner was cold.” She got up quickly. “I\u0027m going to tell Agatha to say I\u0027ve got a migraine.”\\n\\n Agatha came out through the drawing-room door. She looked fussed. She was followed closely by three men. She said hurriedly: “Gemmun from Kingston\u0027m. To see de Colonel.”\\n\\n The leading man slid past the housekeeper. He was still wearing his hat, a panama with a short very up-curled brim. He took this off with his left hand and held it against his stomach. The rays of the sun glittered on hair-grease and on a mouthful of smiling white teeth. He went up to Colonel Havelock, his outstretched hand held straight in front of him. “Major Gonzales. From Havana. Pleased to meet you, Colonel.”\\n\\n The accent was the sham American of a Jamaican taxi-driver. Colonel Havelock had got to his feet. He touched the outstretched hand briefly. He looked over the Major\u0027s shoulder at the other two men who had stationed themselves on either side of the door. They were both carrying that new holdall of the tropics - a Pan American overnight bag. The bags looked heavy. Now the two men bent down together and placed them beside their yellowish shoes. They straightened themselves. They wore flat white caps with transparent green visors that cast green shadows down to their cheekbones. Through the green shadows their intelligent animal eyes fixed themselves on the Major, reading his behaviour.\\n\\n “They are my secretaries.”\\n\\n Colonel Havelock took a pipe out of his pocket and began to fill it. His direct blue eyes took in the sharp clothes, the natty shoes, the glistening fingernails of the Major and the blue jeans and calypso shirts of the other two. He wondered how he could get these men into his study and near the revolver in the top drawer of his desk. He said: “What can I do for you?” As he lit his pipe he watched the Major\u0027s eyes and mouth through the smoke.\\n\\n Major Gonzales spread his hands. The width of his smile remained constant. The liquid, almost golden eyes were amused, friendly. “It is a matter of business, Colonel. I represent a certain gentleman in Havana” - he made a throw-away gesture with his right hand. “A powerful gentleman. A very fine guy.” Major Gonzales assumed an expression of sincerity. “You would like him, Colonel. He asked me to present his compliments and to inquire the price of your property.”\\n\\n Mrs Havelock, who had been watching the scene with a polite half-smile on her lips, moved to stand beside her husband. She said kindly, so as not to embarrass the poor man: “What a shame, Major. All this way on these dusty roads! Your friend really should have written first, or asked anyone in Kingston or at Government House. You see, my husband\u0027s family have lived here for nearly three hundred years.” She looked at him sweetly, apologetically. “I\u0027m afraid there just isn\u0027t any question of selling Content. There never has been. I wonder where your important friend can possibly have got the idea from.”\\n\\n Major Gonzales bowed briefly. His smiling face turned back to Colonel Havelock. He said, as if Mrs Havelock had not opened her mouth: “My gentleman is told this is one of the finest estancias in Jamaica. He is a most generous man. You may mention any sum that is reasonable.”\\n\\n Colonel Havelock said firmly: “You heard what Mrs Havelock said. The property is not for sale.”\\n\\n Major Gonzales laughed. It sounded quite genuine laughter. He shook his head as if he was explaining something to a rather dense child. “You misunderstand me, Colonel. My gentleman desires this property and no other property in Jamaica. He has some funds, some extra funds, to invest. These funds are seeking a home in Jamaica. My gentleman wishes this to be their home.”\\n\\n Colonel Havelock said patiently: “I quite understand, Major. And I am so sorry you have wasted your time. Content will never be for sale in my lifetime. And now, if you\u0027ll forgive me. My wife and I always dine early, and you have a long way to go.” He made a gesture to the left, along the veranda. “I think you\u0027ll find this is the quickest way to your car. Let me show you.”\\n\\n Colonel Havelock moved invitingly, but when Major Gonzales stayed where he was, he stopped. The blue eyes began to freeze.\\n\\n There was perhaps one less tooth in Major Gonzales\u0027s smile and his eyes had become watchful. But his manner was still jolly. He said cheerfully, “Just one moment, Colonel.” He issued a curt order over his shoulder. Both the Havelocks noticed the jolly mask slip with the few sharp words through the teeth. For the first time Mrs Havelock looked slightly uncertain. She moved still closer to her husband. The two men picked up their blue Pan American bags and stepped forward. Major Gonzales reached for the zipper on each of them in turn and pulled. The taut mouths sprang open. The bags were full to the brim with neat solid wads of American money. Major Gonzales spread his arms. “All hundred dollar bills. All genuine. Half a million dollars. That is, in your money, let us say, one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. A small fortune. There are many other good places to live in the world, Colonel. And perhaps my gentleman would add a further twenty thousand pounds to make the round sum. You would know in a week. All I need is half a sheet of paper with your signature. The lawyers can do the rest. Now, Colonel,” the smile was winning, “shall we say yes and shake hands on it? Then the bags stay here and we leave you to your dinner.”\\n\\n The Havelocks now looked at the Major with the same expression - a mixture of anger and disgust. One could imagine Mrs Havelock telling the story next day. “Such a common, greasy little man. And those filthy plastic bags full of money! Timmy was wonderful. He just told him to get out and take the dirty stuff away with him.”\\n\\n Colonel Havelock\u0027s mouth turned down with distaste. He said: “I thought I had made myself clear. Major. The property is not for sale at any price. And I do not share the popular thirst for American dollars. I must now ask you to leave.” Colonel Havelock laid his cold pipe on the table as if he was preparing to roll up his sleeves.\\n\\n For the first time Major Gonzales\u0027s smile lost its warmth. The mouth continued to grin but it was now shaped in an angry grimace. The liquid golden eyes were suddenly brassy and hard. He said softly: “Colonel. It is I who have not made myself clear. Not you. My gentleman has instructed me to say that if you will not accept his most generous terms we must proceed to other measures.”\\n\\n Mrs Havelock was suddenly afraid. She put her hand on Colonel Havelock\u0027s arm and pressed it hard. He put his hand over hers in reassurance. He said through tight lips: “Please leave us alone and go, Major. Otherwise I shall communicate with the police.”\\n\\n The pink tip of Major Gonzales\u0027s tongue came out and slowly licked along his lips. All the light had gone out of his face and it had become taut and hard. He said harshly. “So the property is not for sale in your lifetime, Colonel. Is that your last word?” His right hand went behind his back and he clicked his fingers softly, once. Behind him the gun-hands of the two men slid through the opening of their gay shirts above the waistbands. The sharp animal eyes watched the Major\u0027s fingers behind his back.\\n\\n Mrs Havelock\u0027s hand went up to her mouth. Colonel Havelock tried to say yes, but his mouth was dry. He swallowed noisily. He could not believe it. This mangy Cuban crook must be bluffing. He managed to say thickly: “Yes, it is.”\\n\\n Major Gonzales nodded curtly. “In that case, Colonel, my gentleman will carry on the negotiations with the next owner - with your daughter.”\\n\\n The fingers clicked. Major Gonzales stepped to one side to give a clear field of fire. The brown monkey-hands came out from under the gay shirts. The ugly sausage-shaped hunks of metal spat and thudded - again and again, even when the two bodies were on their way to the ground.\\n\\n Major Gonzales bent down and verified where the bullets had hit. Then the three small men walked quickly back through the rose and white drawing-room and across the dark carved mahogany hall and out through the elegant front door. They climbed unhurriedly into a black Ford Consul Sedan with Jamaican number plates and, with Major Gonzales driving and the two gunmen sitting upright in the back seat, they drove off at an easy pace down the long avenue of Royal Palms. At the junction of the drive and the road to Port Antonio the cut telephone wires hung down through the trees like bright lianas. Major Gonzales slalomed the car carefully and expertly down the rough parochial road until he was on the metalled strip near the coast. Then he put on speed. Twenty minutes after the killing he came to the outer sprawl of the little banana port. There he ran the stolen car on to the grass verge beside the road and the three men got out and walked the quarter of a mile through the sparsely lit main street to the banana wharves. The speedboat was waiting, its exhaust bubbling. The three men got in and the boat zoomed off across the still waters of what an American poetess has called the most beautiful harbour in the world. The anchor chain was already half up on the glittering fifty-ton Chriscraft. She was flying the Stars and Stripes. The two graceful antennae of the deep-sea rods explained that these were tourists - from Kingston, perhaps, or from Montego Bay. The three men went on board and the speedboat was swung in. Two canoes were circling, begging. Major Gonzales tossed a fifty-cent piece to each of them and the stripped men dived. The twin diesels awoke to a stuttering roar and the Chriscraft settled her stern down a fraction and made for the deep channel below the Titchfield hotel. By dawn she would be back in Havana. The fishermen and wharfingers ashore watched her go, and went on with their argument as to which of the filmstars holidaying in Jamaica this could have been.\\n\\n Up on the broad veranda of Content the last rays of the sun glittered on the red stains. One of the doctor birds whirred over the balustrade and hovered close above Mrs Havelock\u0027s heart, looking down. No, this was not for him. He flirted gaily off to his roosting-perch among the closing hibiscus.\\n\\n There came the sound of someone in a small sports car making a racing change at the bend of the drive. If Mrs Havelock had been alive she would have been getting ready to say: “Judy, I\u0027m always telling you not to do that on the corner. It scatters gravel all over the lawn and you know how it ruins Joshua\u0027s lawn-mower.”\\n\\n It was a month later. In London, October had begun with a week of brilliant Indian summer, and the noise of the mowers came up from Regent\u0027s Park and in through the wide open windows of M\u0027s office. They were motor-mowers and James Bond reflected that one of the most beautiful noises of summer, the drowsy iron song of the old machines, was going for ever from the world. Perhaps today children felt the same about the puff and chatter of the little two-stroke engines. At least the cut grass would smell the same.\\n\\n Bond had time for these reflections because M seemed to be having difficulty in coming to the point. Bond had been asked if he had anything on at the moment, and he had replied happily that he hadn\u0027t and had waited for Pandora\u0027s box to be opened for him. He was mildly intrigued because M had addressed him as James and not by his number - 007. This was unusual during duty hours. It sounded as if there might be some personal angle to this assignment - as if it might be put to him more as a request than as an order. And it seemed to Bond that there was an extra small cleft of worry between the frosty, damnably clear, grey eyes. And three minutes was certainly too long to spend getting a pipe going. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8/page-6.html","bookId":1551,"book":{"id":1551,"title":"For Your Eyes Only (James Bond #8)","description":"Storyline: For Your Eyes Only (James Bond (Original Series) #8) \\n \"Bond watched her as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle. It was hopeless. She was coming to meet someone—her lover. She was the sort of woman who always belongs to somebody else. What damnable luck! \\n Before Bond could pull himself together, the girl had come up to his table and sat down. ‘I’m sorry I’m late. We’ve got to get moving at once. You’re wanted at the office.’ She added under her breath: ‘Crash dive.’\" \\n Sudden emergencies and beautiful girls who aren’t quite what they seem and are the stock-in-trade of James Bond. And when 007 is on the case there’s only one thing you can be sure of—the result will be thrilling. And whether he’s dealing with the assassination of a Cuban thug in America, the destruction of an international heroin ring, or sudden death in the Seychelles, Bond gets the job done. In his own suave and unmistakable style…\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8.jpg","author":"Ian Fleming","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/for-your-eyes-only-james-bond-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:51 PM"}}
