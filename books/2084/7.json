{"id":89185,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"ON HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY there was a banquet for the first sol, despite all she could do to prevent it. Galanna shot her glances like poisoned arrows and clung curiously near Tor\u0027s side for someone else\u0027s wife of so few seasons. Perlith made witty remarks at Aerin\u0027s expense in his soft light tenor that always sounded kind, whatever he might be saying. The king her father toasted her, and the faces around the tables in the great hall glittered with smiles; but Aerin looked at them sadly and saw only the baring of teeth. Tor watched her: she was wearing a golden tunic over a long red skirt; the tunic had embroidered flowers wound round its hem, and petals of many colors stitched drifting down the full sleeves; she wore the same two rings she had at Galanna\u0027s wedding. Her flame-colored hair was twisted around her head, and a golden circlet was set upon it, and over her forehead three golden birds held green stones in their beaks. He saw her wince away from the courtiers\u0027 smiles, and he shook Galanna\u0027s hand from his arm impatiently, and then Galanna no longer even pretended to smile. Aerin did not notice this, for she never looked at Galanna if she could help it, and if Galanna were near Tor she didn\u0027t look at Tor either. But Arlbeth noticed. He knew what it was that he saw, for better or for worse, and it was not often that he did not know what was best done about the things he saw; but in this case he did not know. What he read in Tor\u0027s face tore at his heart, for it would be his heart\u0027s fondest wish that these two might wed, and yet he knew his people had never loved the daughter of his second wife, and he feared their mistrust, and he had reason to fear it. Aerin felt her father\u0027s arm around her shoulders, and turned to smile up at him. After the banquet she went to sit in her window seat, staring into the dark courtyard; the torches around its perimeter left great pools of shadow near the castle walls. Her bedroom was dark as well, and Teka had not yet come to be sure she had hung her good clothes up as she should instead of leaving them on the floor where she would step on them. There was a light knock on the door. She turned and said, \"Come in,\" with surprise; if she had thought about it, she would have been silent and let the visitor leave without finding her. She wished to be alone after the hall full of food and talk and bright smiles. It was Tor. She could see him outlined in the light from the hall, and she had been sitting in the dark long enough to see clearly. But he blinked and looked around, for her figure was only a part of the heavy curtains that hung around the deep window alcove. She stirred, and he saw the flicker of her red skirt. \"Why do you sit in the dark?\" \"There was too much light in the hall tonight.\" Tor was silent. After a moment she sighed, and reached for a candle and flint. It seemed to Tor that the shadows it cast upon her face made her briefly old: a woman with grandchildren, for all her brilliant hair. Then she set the candle on a small table and smiled at him, and she was eighteen again. She saw that he carried something in his arms: a long narrow something, wrapped in dark cloth. \"I have brought you your birthday present - privately, as I thought you might prefer.\" And so that I need not do any explaining, he thought. She knew at once what it was: a sword. She watched with rising excitement as he unrolled the wrappings, and from them, gleaming, came her sword, her very own sword. She reached for it eagerly, and slid it out of its scabbard. It was plain but for some work on the hilt to make the grip sure; but she felt it light and true and perfect in her hand, and her hand trembled with the pride of it. \"Thank you,\" she said, her eyes still fixed on the sword, so she did not see the look of hope and pity on Tor\u0027s face as he watched her. \"At dawn you shall try it out,\" said Tor, and the tone of his voice shook her out of her reverie, and she raised her eyes to his. \"I will meet you at our usual place,\" he said, and tried to speak as if this were a lesson like any other lesson; and if he failed, Aerin still did not guess why he failed. \"This is ever so much better than another dressing gown,\" she said lightly, and was pleased to see him smile. \"It was a very beautiful dressing gown.\" \"If it had been less beautiful, I would not have disliked it so much. You were as bad as Teka, trying to keep me in bed, or trailing about my rooms in a dressing gown forever.\" \"And a lot of good it did us, despite the fact that you could not stand on your feet without either fainting or falling over.\" \"It was concentrating on my lessons with you that finally sweated the last of the surka out of me,\" Aerin said, waving her birthday present gently under his nose. \"I almost believe you,\" he replied sadly. So they were standing, looking at each other, with the naked blade upheld between them, when Teka come through the open door behind them. \"Gholotat protect us,\" said Teka, and closed the door behind her. \"Is my birthday present not beautiful?\" said Aerin, and turned the blade back and forth quickly so that it winked at her old nurse as she stood by the door. Teka looked at her face and then at Tor\u0027s, and then back at Aerin\u0027s, and said nothing. \"I will bid you good night,\" said Tor, and because Teka was there he dared reach out his hands to Aerin, and put them on her shoulders, as she slid her sword into its scabbard, and kiss Her cheek as a cousin might; which he would not have dared had they been alone. He bowed to Teka, and left them. Perhaps it was having a real sword of one\u0027s own. Perhaps it was being eighteen - or that eighteen years\u0027 practice of being stubborn was finally paying off. If she still stumbled over the corners of rugs or bumped into doorways while she was thinking about other things, she no longer bothered looking around anxiously to find out if anyone had seen her: either they had or they hadn\u0027t, and she had other things on her mind; she reveled in those other things. They meant that she did not blush automatically when she caught sight of Perlith, knowing that he would have thought of something to say to her since the last time she had failed to avoid him, and that his little half smile beneath half-lidded eyes would make whatever he said worse. She walked through the halls of the castle and the streets of the City the most direct way instead of the way she would meet the fewest people; and she avoided the surka in the royal garden, but only that it might not make her sick again. She did not cringe from the thought of its presence, or from the shame that she had to avoid it in the first place; nor did she any longer feel that breathing the garden air was synonymous with breathing Galanna\u0027s malice. She had discovered how to make the dragonfire ointment. It was, she knew, sheer obstinacy that had kept her at it-over two years of making fractional changes in her mixtures, learning how to find and prepare all the ingredients for the mixtures, for she could not continue raiding Hornmar\u0027s and Teka\u0027s supplies; finding small apothecary shops in the City that might sell the odder ones, and riding out on the reluctant Kisha for the herbs that grew nearby. At first she had wondered if anyone would try to stop her, and her first visits to shopkeepers, and beyond the City gates, gave her stomachaches of dread. But the shopkeepers attended her respectfully and even helpfully, and slowly the visits stopped seeming so awful. There was no sense in trying to disguise herself; she was the only person in the City with orange hair, and any Damarian who had never in fact seen her would know instantly who she was. She had tried the effect of a scarf over the give-away hair, but as soon as she looked in a mirror she realized this wouldn\u0027t work: the scarf was obviously there to hide her hair, and she still had orange eyebrows. There was stuff Galanna used to blacken her brown lashes, but Aerin had no idea how to get hold of it, and thought that while Teka seemed willing to let her and her peculiar errands alone at present, she would probably throw a fit and spoil everything if she caught her royal charge creeping around with her hair hidden and her brows blackened. And as she wasn\u0027t stopped, her confidence grew, and she swept into the shops she frequented with her head high as a first sol should, and made her purchases, and swept out again. She felt tremendously grand, but the shopmen and women found her charmingly unpretentious, being accustomed to the Perliths and Galannas who never looked anyone in the eye and were never satisfied (it was widely held that the woman who supplied Galanna with her brow-darkener more than earned the fancy price she charged), and who always had lackeys to handle the money and the purchases themselves while they fingered their jewels and looked into the distance. Arlbeth would have been pleased to hear the small new thread of gossip that began to circulate in the City about the witchwoman\u0027s daughter, and how the daughter (like the mother, a few folk now recalled) had a smile for everyone; and this view of the king\u0027s daughter almost eased the fear of her that had begun with the rumor that she was enspelling the first sola. A few of her new supporters decided that Tor, as first sola and king to be, understandably wanted a quiet family life; and the king\u0027s daughter, of all those court ladies, looked the likeliest to give it to him. There were even those, especially among the older folk, who shook their heads and said that they shouldn\u0027t keep the young first sol mewed up in that castle the way they did; it\u0027d be better if she were let out to mingle with her people. If Aerin could have heard, she would have laughed. And the things she bought were such harmless things, even if some of them were odd, and even though, as the months passed, she did buy quite a quantity of them. Nothing there that could cause any ... mischief. Hornmar had mentioned, very quietly, to one or two of his particular friends the first sol\u0027s miraculous cure of old Talat; and somehow that tale got around too, and as the witchwoman\u0027s easy smile was remembered, so did some folk also begin to remember her way with animals. It was a few months before her nineteenth birthday that she put a bit of yellowish grease on a fresh bit of dry wood, held it with iron pincers, and thrust it into the small candle flame at the corner of her work table - and nothing happened. She had been performing this particular set of motions - measuring, noting down, mixing, applying and watching the wood burn- - for so long that her movements were deft and exact with long practice even while her brain tended to go off on its own and contemplate her next meeting of swords with Tor, or the nagging Teka was sure to begin within the next day or two for her to darn her stockings since they all had holes in them and lately she had perforce always to wear boots when she attended the court in the great hall so that the holes wouldn\u0027t show. She was thinking that the green stockings probably had the smallest and most mendable holes, and she had to have dinner in the hall tonight. Since she\u0027d turned eighteen she\u0027d been expected to take part in the dancing occasionally, and there was sure to be dancing tonight since the dinner was in honor of Thorped and his son, who were here from the south; one of Thorped\u0027s daughters was one of Galanna\u0027s ladies. It was difficult dancing in boots and she needed all the help she could get. At this point she realized that her arm was getting tired - and that the bit of yellow-slick wood was peacefully ignoring the fire that burned around it, and that the iron tongs were getting hot in her hand. She jumped, and knocked over the candlestick and dropped the hot tongs, and the greasy bit of wood skittered over the dusty, woodchip-littered floor, picking up shreds and shavings till it looked like a new sort of pomander. She had set up shop in a deserted stone shed near Talat\u0027s pasture that had once held kindling and things like old axe handles and sticks of wood that might make new axe handles, and she had never gotten around to sweeping the floor. Her hands were shaking so badly that she dropped the candle again when she tried to pick it up, and missed when she went to stamp out the thread of smoke that rose from the floor where the candle had fallen. She sat down on a pile of axe handles and took a few deep breaths, and thought fixedly about green stockings. Then she stood up, lit the candle again, and set it quietly back in its holder. She\u0027d learned in the long months past not to waste her time and the apothecaries\u0027 wares by making more than a tiny trial bit of each mixture, and the marble bowl where the final mashing and mixing went on before the experiment with the candle flame was no bigger than an eggcup. There was just enough in the bottom of the cup now to grease one fingertip. She chose the left index finger, which had been the one to get burnt with the result of her very first fire-ointment attempt, what seemed centuries ago. She held the fingertip steadily in the flame, and watched it; the pointed blue-and-yellow oval of the fire parted smoothly around her finger and rejoined above it to prick the shadows of the stone ceiling. She felt nothing. She withdrew the finger and stared at it with awe - touched it with another finger. Skin-heat, no more; and while it had remained stickily apparent on the surface of the wood, the ointment was not greasy on her finger. Kenet. It existed. She checked her notes to be sure she could read what she had written about the proportions of this particular attempt; then blew out the candle and went off in a daze to darn stockings. Teka asked her twice, sharply, what was the matter with her, as she tried to help her dress for the court dinner. Aerin\u0027s darns were worse than usual - which was saying a good deal, and Teka had said even more when she saw them, but as much out of worry for her sol\u0027s extraordinary vagueness as from straightforward exasperation at yet another simply homely task done ill. Usually, big court dinners made Aerin clumsy and rather desperately here-and-now. Teka finally tied ribbons around both of Aerin\u0027s ankles to hide the miserable lumps of mending and was even more appalled when Aerin did not object. Ankle ribbons were all the fashion among the higher-born young ladies this year; when this first became apparent Teka had had a difficult time convincing Aerin not to lengthen all her skirts eight inches, that they might drag on the floor and render all questions of ankle adornment academic; and Teka was fairly sure the only reason she\u0027d won the argument was that Aerin couldn\u0027t face the thought of all the sewing such a project would entail. Teka hung a tassel at the front of one ankle, to fall gracefully over the high arch of Aerin\u0027s long foot (not that it would stay there; Galanna and the others had developed a coy little hitch and skip to their walk, to make their tassels fall forward as they should), and pinned a small silver brooch bearing the royal crest on the other, and Aerin didn\u0027t even fidget. She was dreamily staring into space; she was even wearing a slight smile. Could she have fallen in love? Teka wondered. Who? Thorped\u0027s son - what was his name? Surely not. He was half a head shorter than she and wispy. Teka sighed and stood up. \"Aerin - are you sure you\u0027re not ill?\" she said. Aerin came back to herself with a visible jerk and said, \"Dear Teka, I\u0027m fine. Truly I am.\" Then she looked down with a scowl and wiggled her ankles. \"Ugh,\" \"They hide your - dare I call them - darns,\" Teka said severely. \"There\u0027s that,\" said Aerin, and smiled again, and Teka thought, What ails the girl? I will look for Tor tonight; his face will tell me something.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hero-and-the-crown-damar-1/page-7.html","bookId":2084,"book":{"id":2084,"title":"The Hero And The Crown (Damar #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hero and the Crown (Damar #1) The Hero and the Crown is a fantasy novel written by Robin McKinley and published by Greenwillow Books in 1984.
