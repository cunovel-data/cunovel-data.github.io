{"id":66010,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Reacher went right to bed, even though it was still early. Sleep when you can, so you won\u0027t need to when you can\u0027t. That was his rule. He had never worked regular hours. To him, there was no real difference between a Tuesday and a Sunday, or a Monday and a Friday, or night and day. He was happy to sleep twelve hours, and then work the next thirty-six. And if he didn\u0027t have to work the next thirty-six, then he\u0027d sleep twelve hours again, and again, as often as he could, until something else cropped up. The bed was short and the mattress was lumpy. The air in the room had settled like a thick hot soup on the thin sheet covering him. He could hear insects outside, clicking and whining loudly. There might have been a billion of them, separately audible if he concentrated hard enough, merging together into a single scream if he didn\u0027t. The sound of the night, far from anywhere. There were lonely guttural cries from cougars and coyotes way off in the distance. The horses heard them too, and he sensed restless movement over in the barn, quieting after a moment, starting up again after the next ghostly, plaintive yelp. He heard rustling air and imagined he felt changes in pressure as colonies of bats took flight. He imagined he could feel the beat of their leathery wings. He fell asleep watching the stars through a small window high above him. The road from Pecos to El Paso is more than two hundred miles long, and is dotted on both sides with occasional clumps of motels and gas stations and fast food outlets. The killing crew drove an hour west, which took them seventy miles, and then stopped at the second place they saw. That was the woman\u0027s habit. Not the first place. Always the second place. And always arrive very late. It was close to a superstition, but she rationalized it as good security. The second place had a gas station big enough for eighteen-wheelers to use and a two-story motel and a twenty-four-hour diner. The tall fair man went into the motel office and paid cash for two rooms. They weren\u0027t adjoining. One was on the first floor far from the office and the second was upstairs, halfway down the row. The woman took the upstairs room. \"Get some sleep,\" she told her partners. \"We\u0027ve still got work to do.\" Reacher heard Josh and Billy come back at two in the morning. The air was still hot. The insects were still loud. He heard the pick-up engine a couple of miles south, growing nearer and louder, slowing, turning in at the gate. He heard the squeal of springs as it bounced across the yard. He heard it drive into the shed beneath him, and he heard the motor switch off. Then there was just tinkling and clicking as it cooled, and footsteps on the stairs. They were loud and clumsy. He stayed as deeply asleep as he could and tracked their sounds past him, over to the bathroom, back to their bunks. Their bedsprings creaked as they threw themselves down. Then there was nothing but the insects and the wet rhythmic breathing of men who had worked hard all day and drunk hard all night. It was a sound he was familiar with. He had spent seventeen years in dormitories, off and on. The insect noise was completely gone when he woke. So were the stars. The high window showed luminous streaks of dawn in their place. Maybe six in the morning, he thought, summer, this far south. It was already hot. He lifted his arm and checked his watch. Ten past six, Saturday morning. He thought about Jodie, in London. It was ten past twelve in London. Six hours ahead. She would have been up for ages. Probably at a museum, looking at pictures. Maybe thinking about lunch, in some English tearoom. Then he thought about Carmen Greer, over in the main house, forty-eight hours away from waking up on the day Sloop came home. And then Ellie, maybe hot and restless on her tiny cot, innocently barreling on toward the day her little life would change again. He threw back the crumpled sheet and walked naked to the bathroom, carrying his clothes balled in his hand. Josh and Billy were still deep asleep. They were both still dressed. Josh still had his boots on. They were snoring halfheartedly, sprawled out and inert. There was a vague smell of old beer in the air. The smell of hangovers. He set the shower going warm until he had soaped the sweat off his body and then turned it to cold to wake himself up. The cold water was nearly as warm as the hot. He imagined it pumping out of the baked ground, picking up heat all the way. He filled a sink with water and soaked his clothes. It was a trick he\u0027d picked up as a kid, long ago, somewhere out in the Pacific, from sentries on the midday watch. If you dress in wet clothes, you\u0027ve got a built-in air conditioner that keeps you cool until they dry out. An evaporative principle, like a swamp cooler. He dressed with the clammy cotton snagging against his skin and headed down the stairs and outside into the dawn. The sun was over the horizon ahead of him. The sky was arching purple overhead. No trace of cloud. The dust under his feet was still hot from yesterday. The watchers assembled piecemeal, like they had five times before. It was a familiar routine by then. One of the men drove the pick-up to the boy\u0027s place and found him outside and waiting. Then they drove together to the second man\u0027s place, where they found that the routine had changed. \"He just called me,\" the second man explained. \"Some different plan. We got to go to someplace up on the Coyanosa Draw for new instructions, face to face.\" \"Face to face with who?\" the first man said. \"Not him, right?\" \"No, some new people we\u0027re going to be working with.\" The boy said nothing. The first man just shrugged. \"O.K. with me,\" he said. \"Plus, we\u0027re going to get paid,\" the second man said. \"Even better,\" the first man said. The second man squeezed onto the bench seat and closed his door and the pick-up turned and headed north. Reacher walked around the corner of the bunkhouse and past the corrals to the barn. He could hear no sound at all. The whole place felt stunned by the heat. He was suddenly curious about the horses. Did they lie down to sleep? He ducked in the big door and found the answer was no, they didn\u0027t. They were sleeping standing up, heads bowed, knees locked against their weight. The big old mare he\u0027d tussled with the night before smelled him and opened an eye. Looked at him blankly and moved a front foot listlessly and closed her eye again. He glanced around the barn, rehearsing the work he might be expected to perform. The horses would need feeding, presumably. So there must be a food store someplace. What did they eat? Hay, he guessed. There were bales of it all over the place. Or was that straw, for the floor? He found a separate corner room stacked with sacks of some kind of food supplement. Big waxed-paper bags, from some specialist feed supplier up in San Angelo. So probably the horses got mostly hay, with some of the supplement to make up the vitamins. They\u0027d need water, too. There was a faucet in one corner, with a long hose attached to it. A trough in each stall. He came out of the barn and walked up the track to the house. Peered in through the kitchen window. Nobody in there. No activity. It looked the same as it had when he left the night before. He walked on toward the road. Heard the front door open behind him and turned to see Bobby Greer stepping out on the porch. He was wearing the same T-shirt and the same ball cap, but now it was the right way around. The peak was low over his eyes. He was carrying a rifle in his right hand. One of the pieces from the rack in the hallway. A fine .22 bolt-action, modern and in good condition. He put it up on his shoulder and stopped short. \"I was on my way to get you up,\" he said. \"I need a driver.\" \"Why?\" Reacher asked. \"Where are you going?\" \"Hunting,\" Bobby said. \"In the pick-up.\" \"You can\u0027t drive?\" \"Of course I can drive. But it takes two. You drive while I shoot.\" \"You shoot from a truck?\" \"I\u0027ll show you,\" Bobby said. He walked across to the motor barn. Stopped next to the newer pick-up. It had a roll bar built into the load bed. \"You drive,\" he said. \"Out on the range. I\u0027m here in back, leaning on the bar. Gives me a three-hundred-sixty-degree field of fire.\" \"While we\u0027re moving?\" \"That\u0027s the skill of it. It\u0027s fun. Sloop invented it. He was real good.\" \"What are you hunting?\" \"Armadillo,\" Bobby said. He stepped sideways and pointed down the track into the desert. It was a narrow dirt road scuffed into the landscape, meandering left and right to avoid rock formations, taking the path of least resistance. \"Hunting country,\" he said. \"It\u0027s pretty good, south of here. And they\u0027re all out there, good fat ones. \u0027Dillo chili, can\u0027t beat it for lunch.\" Reacher said nothing. \"You never ate armadillo?\" Bobby asked. Reacher shook his head. \"Good eating,\" Bobby said. \"Back when my granddaddy was a boy, depression times, it was about all the eating there was. Texas turkey, they called it. Or Hoover hog. Kept people alive. Now the tree-huggers have got it protected. But if it\u0027s on our land, it\u0027s ours to shoot. That\u0027s the way I see it.\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Reacher said. \"I don\u0027t like hunting.\" \"Why not? It\u0027s a challenge.\" \"For you, maybe,\" Reacher said. \"I already know I\u0027m smarter than an armadillo.\" \"You work here, Reacher. You\u0027ll do what you\u0027re told.\" \"We need to discuss some formalities, before I work here.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like wages.\" \"Two hundred a week,\" Bobby said. \"Bed and three squares a day thrown in.\" Reacher said nothing. \"O.K.?\" Bobby asked. \"You wanted work, right? Or is it just Carmen you want?\" Reacher shrugged. Two hundred a week? It was a long time since he\u0027d worked for two hundred a week. But then, he wasn\u0027t there for the money. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"And you\u0027ll do whatever Josh and Billy tell you to.\" \"O.K.,\" Reacher said again. \"But I won\u0027t take you hunting. Not now, not ever. Call it a matter of conscience.\" Bobby was quiet for a long moment. \"I\u0027ll find ways to keep you away from her, you know. Every day, I\u0027ll find something.\" \"I\u0027ll be in the barn,\" Reacher said, and walked away. Ellie brought his breakfast to him there. She was wearing a miniature set of blue denim dungarees. Her hair was wet and loose. She was carrying a plate of scrambled eggs. She had silverware in her breast pocket, upright, like pens. She was concentrating on remembering a message. \"My mommy says, don\u0027t forget the riding lesson,\" she recited. \"She wants you to meet her here in the barn after lunch.\" Then she ran back toward the house without another word. He sat down on a bale and ate the eggs. Took the empty plate back to the kitchen and headed down to the bunkhouse. Josh and Billy weren\u0027t there to tell him to do anything. Suits me, he thought. He didn\u0027t go looking for them. Just lay down and dozed in the heat. The Coyanosa Draw was a watercourse with a bed wide enough to carry the runoff from the Davis Mountains to the Pecos River, which took it to the Rio Grande all the way down on the border with Mexico. But runoff was seasonal and unreliable, so the region was sparsely populated. There were abandoned farmsteads built close to the dry riverbed, far from each other, far from anywhere. One of them had an old swaybacked house baked gray by the sun. In front of it was an empty barn. The barn had no doors, just an open wall facing west toward the house. The way the buildings were set in the landscape, the interior of the barn was invisible except from the yard right in front of it. The Crown Victoria was waiting inside the barn, its engine idling to keep the air going. The barn had an exterior staircase leading up to a hayloft, with a small platform outside the door at the top. The woman was out in the heat, up on the platform, where she could survey the meandering approach road. She saw the watchers\u0027 pick-up two miles away. It was traveling fast and kicking up a plume of dust. She waited until she was sure it was unaccompanied and then she turned and walked down the stairs. Signaled to the others. They got out of the car and stood waiting in the heat. They heard the pick-up on the road, and then it pulled around the corner of the barn and slowed in the yard. They directed it with hand signals, like traffic cops. They pointed into the barn. One of them led the truck on foot, gesturing like the guy on the airport apron. He brought it tight up to the rear wall, gesturing all the time, and then he gave a thumbs-up to halt it. He stepped alongside the driver\u0027s window and his partner stepped to the passenger door. The driver shut off the motor and relaxed. Human nature. The end of a fast drive to a secret rendezvous, the intrigue of new instructions, the prospect of a big payday. He wound down his window. On the passenger\u0027s side, the second man did the same thing. Then they both died, shot in the side of the head with nine-millimeter bullets. The boy in the middle lived exactly one second longer, both sides of his face splattered with blood and brain tissue, his notebook clutched in his hands. Then the small dark man leaned in and shot him twice in the chest. The woman pushed him out of the way and adjusted the window winders on both doors to leave the glass cracked open about an inch. An inch would let insects in and keep scavengers out. Insects would help with decomposition, but scavengers could drag body parts away, which would risk visibility. Reacher dozed a couple of hours before Josh and Billy got back. They didn\u0027t give him any instructions. They just got cleaned up for lunch. They told him they were invited inside the house to eat. And he wasn\u0027t, because he had refused to drive. \"Bobby told me you ran some guy off,\" he said. Joshua just smiled. \"What guy?\" Billy said. \"Some guy came down here with Carmen.\" \"The Mexican?\" \"Some friend of hers.\" Billy shook his head. \"Don\u0027t know anything about it. We never ran any guy off. What are we, cops?\" \"You\u0027re the cop,\" Joshua said. \"Am I?\" Joshua nodded. \"Bobby said so. You were a military cop.\" \"You been discussing me?\" Joshua shrugged and went quiet. \"Got to go,\" Billy said. Twenty minutes later Carmen herself brought his armadillo lunch to him. It was in a covered dish and smelled strongly of chili. She left, nervous and in a hurry, without saying a word. He tried the meal. The meat was halfway between sweet and ordinary. It had been shredded and chopped and mixed with beans two-alarm sauce from a bottle. Then slightly overdone in a warm oven. He had eaten worse, and he was hungry, which helped. He took his time, and then carried the dish back to the kitchen. Bobby was standing out on the porch steps, like a sentry. \"Horses need more feed supplement,\" he called. \"You\u0027ll go with Josh and Billy to pick it up. After siesta. Get as many bags as fit in the truck.\" Reacher nodded and walked on to the kitchen. Gave the used dish to the maid, and thanked her for the meal. Then he walked down to the barn and went inside and sat on a bale of straw to wait. The horses turned around in their stalls to watch him do it. They were patient and listless in the heat. One of them was chewing slowly. There were hay stalks stuck to its lips. Carmen came in ten minutes later. She had changed into faded blue jeans and a checked cotton shirt with no sleeves. She was carrying a straw hat and her pocketbook. She looked tiny and afraid. \"Bobby doesn\u0027t know you called the IRS,\" he said. \"He thinks it was random snooping. So maybe Sloop does, too.\" She shook her head. \"Sloop knows.\" \"How?\" She shrugged. \"Actually, he doesn\u0027t know. But he convinced himself it had to be me. He was looking for somebody to blame, and who else is there? No evidence or anything, but as it happens he\u0027s right. Ironic, isn\u0027t it?\" \"But he didn\u0027t tell Bobby.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027s too stubborn to agree with them. They hate me, he hates me, he keeps it a secret, they keep it a secret. From him, I mean. They make sure I know it.\" \"You should get out. You\u0027ve got forty-eight hours.\" She nodded. \"Forty-eight hours exactly, I think. They\u0027ll let him out at seven in the morning. They\u0027ll drive all night to be there for him. It\u0027s about seven hours. So he\u0027ll be back home this time on Monday. Just after lunch.\" \"So get out, right now.\" \"I can\u0027t.\" \"You should,\" he said. \"This place is impossible. It\u0027s like the outside world doesn\u0027t exist.\" She smiled, bitterly. \"Tell me about it. I\u0027ve lived here nearly seven years. My whole adult life, give or take.\" She hung her hat and her pocketbook on a nail in the wall. Did all the saddling work herself, quickly and efficiently. She was lithe and deft. The slim muscles in her arms bunched and relaxed as she lifted the saddles. Her fingers were precise with the buckles. She readied two horses in a quarter of the time he had taken to do one. \"You\u0027re pretty good at this,\" he said. \"Gracias, senor,\" she said. \"I get a lot of practice.\" \"So how can they believe you keep falling off, regular as clockwork?\" \"They think I\u0027m clumsy.\" He watched her lead his horse out of its stall. It was one of the geldings. She was tiny beside it. In the jeans, he could have spanned her waist with his hand. \"You sure don\u0027t look clumsy,\" he said. She shrugged. \"People believe what they need to.\" He took the reins from her. The horse huffed through its nose and shifted its feet. Moved its head up and down, up and down. His hand went with it. \"Walk him out,\" she said. \"Shouldn\u0027t we have leather pants? And riding gloves?\" \"Are you kidding? We never wear that stuff here. It\u0027s way too hot.\" He waited for her. Her horse was the smaller mare. She wedged her hat on her head and took her pocketbook off the nail and put it in a saddlebag. Then she followed him, leading her mare confidently out into the yard, into the heat and the sun. \"O.K., like this,\" she said. She stood on the mare\u0027s left and put her left foot in the stirrup. Gripped the horn with her left hand and bounced twice on her right leg and jacked herself smoothly into the saddle. He tried it the same way. Put his left foot in the stirrup, grasped the horn, put all his weight on the stirrup foot and straightened his leg and pulled with his hand. Leaned his weight forward and right and suddenly he was up there in the seat. The horse felt very wide, and he was very high in the air. About the same as riding on an armored personnel carrier. \"Put your right foot in,\" she said. He jammed his foot into the other stirrup and squirmed around until he was as comfortable as he was ever going to get. The horse waited patiently. \"Now bunch the reins on the horn, in your left hand.\" That part was easy. It was just a question of imitating the movies. He let his right hand swing free, like he was carrying a Winchester repeater or a coil of rope. \"O.K., now just relax. And kick gently with your heels.\" He kicked once and the horse lurched into a walk. He used his left hand on the horn to keep himself steady. After a couple of paces he began to understand the rhythm. The horse was moving him left and right and forward and back with every alternate step. He held tight to the horn and used pressure from his feet to keep his body still. \"Good,\" she said. \"Now I\u0027ll go in front and he\u0027ll follow. He\u0027s pretty docile.\" I would be, too, he thought, a hundred ten degrees and two hundred fifty pounds on my back. Carmen clicked her tongue and kicked her heels and her horse moved smoothly around his and led the way through the yard and past the house. She swayed easily in the saddle, the muscles in her thighs bunching and flexing as she kept her balance. Her hat was down over her eyes. Her left hand held the reins and her right was hanging loose at her side. He caught the blue flash of the fake diamond in the sun. She led him out under the gate to the road and straight across without looking or stopping. He glanced left and right, south and north, and saw nothing at all except heat shimmer and distant silver mirages. On the far side of the road was a step about a foot high onto the limestone ledge. He leaned forward and let the horse climb it underneath him. Then the rock rose gently into the middle distance, reaching maybe fifty feet of elevation in the best part of a mile. There were deep fissures running east-west and washed-out holes the size of shell craters. The horses picked their way between them. They seemed pretty sure on their feet. So far, he hadn\u0027t had to do any conscious steering. Which he was happy about, because he wasn\u0027t exactly sure how to. \"Watch for rattlesnakes,\" Carmen called. \"Great,\" he called back. \"Horses get scared by anything that moves. They\u0027ll spook and run. If that happens, just hang on tight and haul on the reins.\" \"Great,\" he said again. There were scrubby plants rooting desperately in cracks in the rock. There were smaller holes, two or three feet across, some of them with undercut sides. Just right for a snake, he thought. He watched them carefully at first. Then he gave it up, because the shadows were too harsh to see anything. And the saddle was starting to wear on him. \"How far are we going?\" he called. She turned, like she had been waiting for the question. \"We need to get over the rise,\" she said. \"Down into the gulches.\" The limestone smoothed out into broader unbroken shelves and she slowed to let his horse move up alongside hers. But it stayed just short of level, which kept him behind her. Kept him from seeing her face. \"Bobby told me you had a key,\" he said. \"Did he?\" \"He said you lost it.\" \"No, that\u0027s not true. They never gave me one.\" He said nothing. \"They made a big point of not giving me one,\" she said. \"Like it was a symbol.\" \"So he was lying?\" She nodded, away from him. \"I told you, don\u0027t believe anything he says.\" \"He said the door\u0027s never locked, anyway.\" \"Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn\u0027t.\" \"He told me you don\u0027t have to knock, either.\" \"That\u0027s a lie, too,\" she said. \"Since Sloop\u0027s been gone, if I don\u0027t knock, they run and grab a rifle. Then they go, oh sorry, but strangers prowling around the house make us nervous. Like a big pretend show.\" He said nothing. \"Bobby\u0027s a liar, Reacher,\" she said. \"I told you that.\" \"I guess he is. Because he also told me you brought some other guy down here, and he got Josh and Billy to run him off. But Josh and Billy didn\u0027t know anything about any guy.\" She was quiet for a long moment. \"No, that was true,\" she said. \"I met a man up in Pecos, about a year ago. We had an affair. At first just at his place up there. But he wanted more.\" \"So you brought him here?\" \"It was his idea. He thought he could get work, and be close to me. I thought it was crazy, but I went along with it. That\u0027s where I got the idea to ask you to come. Because it actually worked for a spell. Two or three weeks. Then Bobby caught us.\" \"And what happened?\" \"That was the end of it. My friend left.\" \"So why would Josh and Billy deny it to me?\" \"Maybe it wasn\u0027t Josh and Billy who ran him off. Maybe they didn\u0027t know about it. Maybe Bobby did it himself. My friend wasn\u0027t as big as you. He was a schoolteacher, out of work.\" \"And he just disappeared?\" \"I saw him again, just once, back in Pecos. He was scared. Wouldn\u0027t talk to me.\" \"Did Bobby tell Sloop?\" \"He promised he wouldn\u0027t. We had a deal.\" \"What kind of a deal?\" She went quiet again. Just rode on, sitting slackly on the swaying horse. \"The usual kind,\" she said. \"If I\u0027d do something for him, he\u0027d keep quiet.\" \"What kind of something?\" She paused again. \"Something I really don\u0027t want to tell you about,\" she said. \"I see.\" \"Yes, you see.\" \"And did he keep quiet?\" \"I really have no idea. He made me do it twice. It was disgusting. He\u0027s disgusting. But he promised faithfully. But he\u0027s a liar, so I\u0027m assuming he told Sloop anyway. On one of his brotherly visits. I always knew it was a lose-lose gamble, but what could I do? What choice did I have?\" \"Bobby figures that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. He thinks we\u0027re having an affair, too.\" She nodded. \"That would be my guess. He doesn\u0027t know Sloop hits me. Even if he did, he wouldn\u0027t expect me to do anything about it.\" Reacher was quiet for a spell. Another twenty yards, thirty, at the slow patient pace of a walking horse. \"You need to get out,\" he said. \"How many times do you have to hear it?\" \"I won\u0027t run,\" she answered. They reached the top of the rise and she made a small sound and her horse stopped walking. His stopped, too, at her shoulder. They were about fifty feet above the plain. Ahead of them, to the west, the caliche sloped gently down again, pocked by dry gulches the size of ballparks. Behind them, to the east, the red house and the other buildings in the compound were spread out a mile away, flat on the baked land like a model. The road ran like a gray ribbon, north and south. Behind the tiny motor barn the dirt track wandered south and east through the desert, like a scar on burned and pockmarked skin. The air was dry and unnaturally clear all the way to both horizons, where it broke up into haze. The heat was a nightmare. The sun was fearsome. Reacher could feel his face burning. \"Take care as we go down,\" Carmen said. \"Stay balanced.\" She moved off ahead of him, letting her horse find its own way down the incline. He kicked with his heels and followed her. He lost the rhythm as his horse stepped short and he started bouncing uncomfortably. \"Follow me,\" she called. She was moving to the right, toward a dry gulch with a flat floor, all stone and sand. He started trying to figure which rein he should pull on, but his horse turned anyway. Its feet crunched on gravel and slipped occasionally. Then it stepped right down into the gulch, which jerked him violently backward and forward. Ahead of him Carmen was slipping out of the saddle. Then she was standing on the ground, stretching, waiting for him. His horse stopped next to hers and he shook his right foot free of the stirrup and got off by doing the exact opposite of what had got him on a half hour before. \"So what do you think?\" she asked. \"Well, I know why John Wayne walked funny.\" She smiled briefly and led both horses together to the rim of the gulch and heaved a large stone over the free ends of both sets of reins. He could hear absolute silence, nothing at all behind the buzz and shimmer of the heat. She lifted the flap of her saddlebag and took out her pocketbook. Zipped it open and slipped her hand in and came out with a small chromium handgun. \"You promised you\u0027d teach me,\" she said. \"Wait,\" he said. \"What?\" He said nothing. Stepped left, stepped right, crouched down, stood tall. Stared at the floor of the gulch, moving around, using the shadows from the sun to help him. \"What?\" she said again. \"Somebody\u0027s been here,\" he said. \"There are tracks. Three people, a vehicle driving in from the west.\" \"Tracks?\" she said. \"Where?\" He pointed. \"Tire marks. Some kind of a truck. Stopped here. Three people, crawled up to the edge on their knees.\" He put himself where the tracks ended at the rim of the gulch. Lay down on the hot grit and hauled himself forward on his elbows. Raised his head. \"Somebody was watching the house,\" he said. \"How do you know?\" \"Nothing else to see from here.\" She knelt alongside him, the chromium pistol in her hand. \"It\u0027s too far away,\" she said. \"Must have used field glasses. Telescopes, even.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"You ever see reflections? The sun on glass? In the mornings, when the sun was in the east?\" She shuddered. \"No,\" she said. \"Never.\" \"Tracks are fresh,\" he said. \"Not more than a day or two old.\" She shuddered again. \"Sloop,\" she said. \"He thinks I\u0027m going to take Ellie. Now I know he\u0027s getting out. He\u0027s having me watched.\" Reacher stood up and walked back to the center of the bowl. \"Look at the tire tracks,\" he said. \"They were here four or five times.\" He pointed down. There were several overlapping sets of tracks in a complex network. At least four, maybe five. The tire treads were clearly pressed into the powdered sand. There was a lot of detail. The outside shoulder of the front right tire was nearly bald. \"But they\u0027re not here today,\" Carmen said. \"Why not?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Reacher said. Carmen looked away. Held out the gun to him. \"Please show me how to use this,\" she said. He moved his gaze from the tracks in the sand and looked at the gun. It was a Lorcin L-22 automatic, two-and-a-half-inch barrel, chrome frame, with plastic molded grips made to look like pink mother-of-pearl. Made in Mira Loma, California, not too long ago, and probably never used since it left the factory. \"Is it a good one?\" she asked. \"How much did you pay for it?\" \"Over eighty dollars.\" \"Where?\" \"In a gun store up in Pecos.\" \"Is it legal?\" She nodded. \"I did all the proper paperwork. Is it any good?\" \"I guess,\" he said. \"As good as you\u0027ll get for eighty bucks, anyway.\" \"The man in the store said it was ideal.\" \"For what?\" \"For a lady. I didn\u0027t tell him why I needed it.\" He hefted it in his hand. It was tiny, but reasonably solid. Not light, not heavy. Not heavy enough to be loaded, anyway. \"Where are the bullets?\" he asked. She stepped back toward the horses. Took a small box out of her bag. Came back and handed it to him. It was neatly packed with tiny .22 shells. Maybe fifty of them. \"Show me how to load it,\" she said. He shook his head. \"You should leave it out here,\" he said. \"Just dump it and forget about it.\" \"But why?\" \"Because this whole thing is crazy. Guns are dangerous, Carmen. You shouldn\u0027t keep one around Ellie. There might be an accident.\" \"I\u0027ll be very careful. And the house is full of guns anyway.\" \"Rifles are different. She\u0027s too small to reach the trigger and have it pointing at herself simultaneously.\" \"I keep it hidden. She hasn\u0027t found it yet.\" \"Only a matter of time.\" She shook her head. \"My decision,\" she said. \"She\u0027s my daughter.\" He said nothing. \"She won\u0027t find it,\" she said. \"I keep it by the bed, and she doesn\u0027t come in there.\" \"What happens to her if you decide to use it?\" She nodded. \"I know. I think about that all the time. I just hope she\u0027s too young to really understand. And when she\u0027s old enough, maybe she\u0027ll see it was the lesser of two evils.\" \"No, what happens to her? There and then? When you\u0027re in jail?\" \"They don\u0027t send you to jail for self-defense.\" \"Who says it\u0027s self-defense?\" \"You know it would be self-defense.\" \"Doesn\u0027t matter what I know. I\u0027m not the sheriff, I\u0027m not the DA, I\u0027m not the judge and jury.\" She went quiet. \"Think about it, Carmen,\" he said. \"They\u0027ll arrest you, you\u0027ll be charged with first-degree homicide. You\u0027ve got no bail money. You\u0027ve got no money for a lawyer either, so you\u0027ll get a public defender. You\u0027ll be arraigned, and you\u0027ll go to trial. Could be six or nine months down the road. Could be a year. Then let\u0027s say everything goes exactly your way from that point on. The public defender makes out it\u0027s self-defense, the jury buys it, the judge apologizes that a wronged woman has been put through all of that, and you\u0027re back on the street. But that\u0027s a year from now. At least. What\u0027s Ellie been doing all that time?\" She said nothing. \"She\u0027ll have spent a year with Rusty,\" he said. \"On her own. Because that\u0027s where the court would leave her. The grandmother? Ideal solution.\" \"Not when they understood what the Greers are like.\" \"O.K., so partway through the year Family Services will arrive and haul her off to some foster home. Is that what you want for her?\" She winced. \"Rusty would send her there anyway. She\u0027d refuse to keep her, if Sloop wasn\u0027t around anymore.\" \"So leave the gun out here in the desert. It\u0027s not a good idea.\" He handed it back to her. She took it and cradled it in her palms, like it was a precious object. She tumbled it from one hand to another, like a child\u0027s game. The fake pearl grips flashed in the sun. \"No,\" she said. \"I want to learn to use it. For self-confidence. And that\u0027s a decision that\u0027s mine to make. You can\u0027t decide for me.\" He was quiet for a beat. Then he shrugged. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Your life, your kid, your decision. But guns are serious business. So pay attention.\" She passed it back. He laid it flat on his left palm. It reached from the ball of his thumb to the middle knuckle of his middle finger. \"Two warnings,\" he said. \"This is a very, very short barrel. See that?\" He traced his right index finger from the chamber to the muzzle. \"Two and a half inches, is all. Did they explain that at the store?\" She nodded. \"The guy said it would fit real easy in my bag.\" \"It makes it a very inaccurate weapon,\" he said. \"The longer the barrel, the straighter it shoots. That\u0027s why rifles are three feet long. If you\u0027re going to use this thing, you need to get very, very close, O.K.? Inches away would be best. Right next to the target. Touching the target if you can. You try to use this thing across a room, you\u0027ll miss by miles.\" \"O.K.,\" she said. \"Second warning.\" He dug a bullet out of the box and held it up. \"This thing is tiny. And slow. The pointy part is the bullet, and the rest of it is the powder in the shell case. Not a very big bullet, and not very much powder behind it. So it\u0027s not necessarily going to do a lot of damage. Worse than a bee sting, but one shot isn\u0027t going to be enough. So you need to get real close, and you need to keep on pulling the trigger until the gun is empty.\" \"O.K.,\" she said again. \"Now watch.\" He clicked out the magazine and fed nine bullets into it. Clicked the magazine back in and jacked the first shell into the breech. Took out the magazine again and refilled the empty spot at the bottom. Clicked it back in and cocked the gun and left the safety catch on. \"Cocked and locked,\" he said. \"You do two things. Push the safety catch, and pull the trigger ten times. It\u0027ll fire ten times before it\u0027s empty, because there\u0027s one already in the mechanism and nine more in the magazine.\" He handed the gun to her. \"Don\u0027t point it at me,\" he said. \"Never point a loaded gun at anything you don\u0027t definitely want to kill.\" She took it and held it away from him, cautiously. \"Try it,\" he told her. \"The safety, and the trigger.\" She used her left hand to unlatch the safety. Then she pointed it in her right and closed her eyes and pulled the trigger. The gun twisted in her grip and pointed down. The blast of the shot sounded quiet, out there in the emptiness. A chip of rock and a spurt of dust kicked off the floor ten feet away. There was a metallic ricochet whang and a muted ring as the shell case ejected and the horses shuffled in place and then silence closed in again. \"Well, it works,\" she said. \"Put the safety back on,\" he said. She clicked the catch and he turned to look at the horses. He didn\u0027t want them to run. Didn\u0027t want to spend time chasing them in the heat. But they were happy enough, standing quietly, watching warily. He turned back and undid his top button and slipped his shirt off over his head. Walked fifteen feet south and laid the shirt on the rim of the gulch, hanging it down and spreading it out to represent a man\u0027s torso. He walked back and stood behind her. \"Now shoot my shirt,\" he said. \"You always aim for the body, because it\u0027s the biggest target, and the most vulnerable.\" She raised the gun, and then lowered it again. \"I can\u0027t do this,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t want holes in your shirt.\" \"I figure there isn\u0027t much of a risk,\" he said. \"Try it.\" She forgot to release the safety catch. Just pulled on the unyielding trigger. Twice, puzzled why it wouldn\u0027t work. Then she remembered and clicked it off. Pointed the gun and closed her eyes and fired. Reacher guessed she missed by twenty feet, high and wide. \"Keep your eyes open,\" he said. \"Pretend you\u0027re mad at the shirt, you\u0027re standing there pointing your finger right at it, like you\u0027re yelling.\" She kept her eyes open. Squared her shoulders and pointed with her right arm held level. She fired and missed again, maybe six feet to the left, maybe a little low. \"Let me try,\" he said. She passed him the gun. It was tiny in his hand. The trigger guard was almost too small to fit his finger. He closed one eye and sighted in. \"I\u0027m aiming for where the pocket was,\" he said. He fired a double-tap, two shots in quick succession, with his hand rocksteady. The first hit the shirt in the armpit opposite the torn pocket. The second hit centrally but low down. He relaxed his stance and handed the gun back. \"Your turn again,\" he said. She fired three more, all of them hopeless misses. High to the right, wide to the left. The last hit the dirt, maybe seven feet short of the target. She stared at the shirt and lowered the gun, disappointed. \"So what have you learned?\" he asked. \"I need to get close,\" she said. \"Damn right,\" he said. \"And it\u0027s not entirely your fault. A short-barrel handgun is a close-up weapon. See what I did? I missed by twelve inches, from fifteen feet. One bullet went left, and the other went down. They didn\u0027t even miss consistently. And I can shoot. I won competitions for pistol shooting in the army. Couple of years, I was the best there was.\" \"O.K.,\" she said. He took the gun from her and squatted in the dust and reloaded it. One up the spout and nine in the magazine. He cocked it and locked it and laid it on the ground. \"Leave it there,\" he said. \"Unless you\u0027re very, very sure. Could you do it?\" \"I think so,\" she said. \"Thinking so isn\u0027t enough. You\u0027ve got to know so. You\u0027ve got to be prepared to get real close, jam it into his gut, and fire ten times. If you don\u0027t, or if you hesitate, he\u0027ll take it away from you, maybe turn it on you, maybe fire wildly and hit Ellie running in from her room.\" She nodded, quietly. \"Last resort.\" \"Believe it. You pull the gun, from that point on, it\u0027s all or nothing.\" She nodded again. \"Your decision,\" he said. \"But I suggest you leave it there.\" She stood still for a long, long time. Then she bent down and picked up the gun. Slipped it back into her bag. He walked over and retrieved his shirt and slipped it over his head. Neither bullet hole showed. One was under his arm, and the other tucked in below the waistband of his pants. Then he tracked around the gulch and picked up all eight spent shell cases. It was an old habit, and good housekeeping. He jingled them together in his hand like small change and put them in his trouser pocket. They talked about fear on the ride home. Carmen was quiet on the way back up the rise, and she stopped again at the peak. The Red House compound stretched below them in the distant haze, and she just sat and looked down at it, both hands clasped on the horn of her saddle, saying nothing, a faraway look in her eyes. Reacher\u0027s horse stopped as usual slightly behind hers, so he got the same view, but framed by the curve of her neck and her shoulder. \"Do you ever get afraid?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. She was quiet again for a spell. \"But how is that possible?\" she asked. He looked at the sky. \"It\u0027s something I learned, when I was a little boy.\" \"How?\" He looked at the ground. \"I had a brother, older than me. So he was always ahead. But I wanted to be doing the same stuff as him. He had scary comics, and anywhere we had American television he\u0027d be watching it. So I looked at the same comics and watched the same shows. There was one show about space adventures. I don\u0027t remember what it was called. We watched it in black-and-white somewhere. Maybe in Europe. They had a spaceship that looked like a little submarine with spider legs. They would land it somewhere and get out and go exploring. I remember one night they got chased by this scary creature. It was hairy, like an ape. Like Bigfoot. Long hairy arms and a big snarl. It chased them back to the spaceship, and they jumped in and slammed the hatch shut just as it was climbing in after them.\" \"And you were scared?\" He nodded, even though he was behind her. \"I was about four, I think. I was terrified. That night I was certain the thing was under my bed. I had this nigh old bed, and I knew the thing was living under it. It was going to come out and get me. I could just about feel its paw reaching up for me. I couldn\u0027t sleep. If I went to sleep, it would come out and get me for sure. So I stayed awake for hours. I would call for my dad, but when he came in, I was too ashamed to tell him. It went on like that for days and days.\" \"And what happened?\" \"I got mad. Not at myself for being afraid, because as far as I was concerned the thing was totally real and I should be afraid. I got mad at the thing for making me afraid. For threatening me. One night I just kind of exploded with fury. I yelled O.K., come out and try it! Just damn well try it! I\u0027ll beat the shit right out of you! I raced it down. I turned the fear into aggression.\" \"And that worked?\" \"I\u0027ve never been scared since. It\u0027s a habit. Those space explorers shouldn\u0027t have turned and run, Carmen. They should have stood there and faced the creature down. They should have stood and fought. You see something scary, you should stand up and step toward it, not away from it. Instinctively, reflexively, in a raging fury.\" \"Is that what you do?\" \"Always.\" \"Is it what I should do? With Sloop?\" \"I think it\u0027s what everybody should do.\" She was quiet for a moment. Just staring down at the house, and then lifting her eyes to the horizon beyond it. She clicked her tongue, and both horses moved off together, down the long slow slope toward the road. She shifted in the saddle to keep her balance. Reacher imitated her posture and stayed safely aboard. But not comfortably. He figured horseback riding would be one of the things he tried once and didn\u0027t repeat. \"So what did Bobby say?\" she asked. \"About us?\" \"He said you\u0027ve been away most days for a month, and some nights, and he figured we\u0027ve been up in a motel in Pecos together having an affair. Now he\u0027s all outraged that you\u0027ve brought me down here, so close to Sloop getting back.\" \"I wish we had been,\" she said. \"In a motel, having an affair. I wish that was all it was.\" He said nothing. She paused a beat. \"Do you wish we had been, too?\" she asked. He watched her in the saddle. Lithe, slim, hips swaying gently against the patient gait of the horse. The dark honey skin of her arms was bright in the sun. Her hair hung to the middle of her back. \"I could think of worse things,\" he said. It was very late in the afternoon when they got back. Josh and Billy were waiting. They were leaning side by side against the wall of the barn, in the harsh shadow below the eaves. Their pick-up was ready for the trip to the feed supplier. It was parked in the yard. \"It takes all three of you?\" Carmen whispered. \"It\u0027s Bobby,\" Reacher said back. \"He\u0027s trying to keep me away from you. Trying to spoil the fun we\u0027re supposed to be having.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I\u0027ll put the horses away,\" she said. \"I should brush them first.\" They dismounted together in front of the barn door. Josh and Billy peeled off the wall, impatience in their body language. \"You ready?\" Billy called. \"He should have been ready a half hour ago,\" Josh said. For that, Reacher made them wait. He walked down to the bunkhouse, very slowly, because he wasn\u0027t going to let them hurry him, and because he was stiff from the saddle. He used the bathroom and rinsed dust off his face. Splashed cold water over his shirt. Walked slowly back. The pick-up had turned to face the gate and the engine was running. Carmen was brushing his horse. Thin clouds of dust were coming off its chestnut fur. Hair? Coat? Josh was sitting sideways in the driver\u0027s seat. Billy was standing next to the passenger door. \"So let\u0027s go,\" he called. He put Reacher in the middle seat. Josh swung his feet in and slammed his door shut. Billy crowded in on the other side and Josh took off toward the gate. Paused at the road and then made a left, at which point Reacher knew the situation was a lot worse than he had guessed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/echo-burning-jack-reacher-5/page-6.html","bookId":2343,"book":{"id":2343,"title":"Echo Burning (Jack Reacher #5)","description":"Storyline: Echo Burning (Jack Reacher #5) Jack Reacher returns in Lee Child\u0027s new \"rip-roaring thriller\" (\"Denver Rocky Mountain News\").
