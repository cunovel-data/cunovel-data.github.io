{"id":66012,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Reacher found Carmen in the parlor. The light was dim and the air was hot and thick. She was sitting alone at the red-painted table. Her back was perfectly straight and her forearms were resting lightly on the wooden surface and her gaze was blank and absolutely level, focused on a spot on the wall where there was nothing to see. \"Twice over,\" she said. \"I feel cheated, twice over. First it was a year, and then it was nothing. Then it was forty-eight hours, but really it was only twenty-four.\" \"You can still get out,\" he said. \"Now it\u0027s less than twenty-four,\" she said. \"It\u0027s sixteen hours, maybe. I\u0027ll have breakfast by myself, but he\u0027ll be back for lunch.\" \"Sixteen hours is enough,\" he said. \"Sixteen hours, you could be anywhere.\" \"Ellie\u0027s fast asleep,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t wake her up and bundle her in a car and run away and be chased by the cops forever.\" Reacher said nothing. \"I\u0027m going to try to face it,\" she said. \"A fresh start. I\u0027m planning to tell him, enough is enough. I\u0027m planning to tell him, he lays a hand on me again, I\u0027ll divorce him. Whatever it takes. However long.\" \"Way to go,\" he said. \"Do you believe I can?\" she asked. \"I believe anybody can do anything,\" he said. \"If they want it enough.\" \"I want it,\" she said. \"Believe me, I want it.\" She went quiet. Reacher glanced around the silent room. \"Why did they paint everything red?\" he asked. \"Because it was cheap,\" she said. \"During the fifties, nobody down here wanted red anything, because of the Communists. So it was the cheapest color at the paint store.\" \"I thought they were rich, back then. With the oil.\" \"They were rich. They still are rich. Richer than you could ever imagine. \"But they\u0027re also mean.\" He looked at the places where the fifty-year-old paint was worn back to the wood. \"Evidently,\" he said. She nodded again. Said nothing. \"Last chance, Carmen,\" he said. \"We could go, right now. There\u0027s nobody here to call the cops. By the time they get back, we could be anywhere you want.\" \"Bobby\u0027s here.\" \"He\u0027s going to stay in the barn.\" \"He\u0027d hear the car.\" \"We could rip out the phones.\" \"He\u0027d chase us. He could get to the sheriff inside two hours.\" \"We could fix the other cars so they wouldn\u0027t work.\" \"He\u0027d hear us doing it.\" \"I could tie him up. I could drown him in a horse trough.\" She smiled, bitterly. \"But you won\u0027t drown Sloop.\" He nodded. \"Figure of speech, I guess.\" She was quiet for a beat. Then she scraped back her chair and stood up. \"Come and see Ellie,\" she said. \"She\u0027s so beautiful when she\u0027s asleep.\" She passed close to him and took his hand in hers. Led him out through the kitchen and into the rear lobby and up the back stairs, toward the noise of the fan turning slowly. Down the long hot corridor to Ellie\u0027s door. She eased it open with her foot and maneuvered him so he could see inside the room. There was a night-light plugged into an outlet low on the wall and its soft orange glow showed the child sprawled on her back, with her arms thrown up around her head. She had kicked off her sheet and the rabbit T-shirt had ridden up and was showing a band of plump pink skin at her waist. Her hair was tumbled over the pillow. Long dark eyelashes rested on her cheeks like fans. Her mouth was open a fraction. \"She\u0027s six and a half,\" Carmen whispered. \"She needs this. She needs a bed of her own, in a place of her own. I can\u0027t make her live like a fugitive.\" He said nothing. \"Do you see?\" she whispered. He shrugged. He didn\u0027t, really. At age six and a half, he had lived exactly like a fugitive. He had at every age, right from birth to yesterday. He had moved from one service base to another, all around the world, often with no notice at all. He recalled days when he got up for school and instead was driven to an airstrip and ended up on the other side of the planet thirty hours later. He recalled stumbling tired and bewildered into dank bungalow bedrooms and sleeping on unmade beds. The next morning, his mother would tell him which country they were in. Which continent they were on. If she knew yet. Sometimes she didn\u0027t. It hadn\u0027t done him any harm. Or, maybe it had. \"It\u0027s your call, I guess,\" he said. She pulled him back into the corridor and eased Ellie\u0027s door shut behind him. \"Now I\u0027ll show you where I hid the gun,\" she said. \"You can tell me if you approve.\" She walked ahead of him down the corridor. The air conditioner was loud. He passed under a vent and a breath of air played over him. It was warm. Carmen\u0027s dress swayed with every step. She was wearing heels and they put tension in the muscles of her legs. He could see tendons in the backs of her knees. Her hair hung down her back and merged with the black pattern on the red fabric of the dress. She turned left and then right and stepped through an archway. There was another staircase, leading down. \"Where are we going?\" he asked. \"Separate wing,\" she said. \"It was added. By Sloop\u0027s grandfather, I think.\" The staircase led to a long narrow ground-floor hallway that led out of the main building to a master suite. It was as big as a small house. There was a dressing area, and a spacious bathroom, and a sitting room with a sofa and two armchairs. Beyond the sitting room was a broad archway. Beyond the archway, there was a bedroom. \"In here,\" she said. She walked straight through the sitting room and led him to the bedroom. \"You see what I mean?\" she said. \"We\u0027re a long way from anywhere. Nobody hears anything. And I try to be quiet, anyway. If I scream, he hits me harder.\" He nodded and looked around. There was a window, facing east, with insects loud beyond the screen. There was a king-size bed close to it, with side tables by the head, and a chest-high piece of furniture full of drawers opposite the foot. It looked like it had been made a hundred years ago, out of some kind of oak trees. \"Texas ironwood,\" she said. \"It\u0027s what you get if you let the mesquite grow tall.\" \"You should have been a teacher,\" he said. \"You\u0027re always explaining things.\" She smiled, vaguely. \"I thought about it, in college. It was a possibility, back then. In my other life.\" She opened the drawer on the top right. \"I moved the gun,\" she said. \"I listened to your advice. Bedside cabinet was too low. Ellie could have found it. This is too high for her.\" He nodded again and moved closer. The drawer was a couple of feet wide, maybe eighteen inches deep. It was her underwear drawer. The pistol was lying on top of her things, which were neatly folded, and silky, and insubstantial, and fragrant. The mother-of-pearl plastic on the grips looked right at home there. \"You could have told me where it was,\" he said. \"You didn\u0027t need to show me.\" She was quiet for a beat. \"He\u0027ll want sex, won\u0027t he?\" she said. Reacher made no reply. \"He\u0027s been locked up a year and a half,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m going to refuse.\" Reacher said nothing. \"It\u0027s a woman\u0027s right, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked. \"To say no?\" \"Of course it is,\" he said. \"Even though the woman is married?\" \"Most places,\" he said. She was quiet for a beat. \"And it\u0027s also her right to say yes, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked. \"Equally,\" he said. \"I\u0027d say yes to you.\" \"I\u0027m not asking.\" She paused. \"So is it O.K. for me to ask you?\" He looked straight at her. \"Depends on why, I guess.\" \"Because I want to,\" she said. \"I want to go to bed with you.\" \"Why?\" \"Honestly?\" she said. \"Just because I want to.\" \"And?\" She shrugged. \"And I want to hurt Sloop a little, I guess, in secret. In my heart.\" He said nothing. \"Before he gets home,\" she said. He said nothing. \"And because Bobby already thinks we\u0027re doing it,\" she said. \"I figure, why get the blame without getting the fun?\" He said nothing. \"I just want a little fun,\" she said. \"Before it all starts up again.\" He said nothing. \"No strings attached,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not looking for it to change anything. About your decision, I mean. About Sloop.\" He nodded. \"It wouldn\u0027t change anything,\" he said. She looked away. \"So what\u0027s your answer?\" she asked. He watched her profile. Her face was blank. It was like all other possibilities were exhausted for her, and all that was left was instinct. Early in his service career, when the threat was still plausible, people talked about what they would do when the enemy missiles were airborne and incoming. This was absolutely the number-one pick, by a huge, huge margin. A universal instinct. And he could see it in her. She had heard the four-minute warning, and the sirens were sounding loud in her mind. \"No,\" he said. She was quiet for a long moment. \"Will you at least stay with me?\" she asked. The killing crew moved fifty miles closer to Pecos in the middle of the night. They did it secretly, some hours after booking in for a second night at their first location. It was the woman\u0027s preferred method. Six false names, two overlapping sets of motel records, the confusion built fast enough to keep them safe. They drove east on I-10 until they passed the I-20 interchange. They headed down toward Fort Stockton until they saw signs for the first group of motels serving the Balmorhea state recreation area. Those motels were far enough from the actual tourist attraction to make them cheap and anonymous. There wasn\u0027t going to be a lot of cutesy decor and personal service. But they would be clean and decent. And they would be full of people exactly like themselves. That was what the woman wanted. She was a chameleon. She had an instinct for the right type of place. She chose the second establishment they came to, and sent the small dark man to pay cash for two rooms. Reacher woke up on Sloop Greer\u0027s sofa with the Sunday dawn. Beyond him, the bedroom window faced east and the night insects were gone and the sky was bright. The bed sheet looked damp and tangled. Carmen wasn\u0027t under it. He could hear the shower running in the bathroom. And he could smell coffee. He got off the sofa and stretched. Wandered through the archway to the bedroom. He saw Carmen\u0027s dress on the floor. He went to the window and checked the weather. No change. The sky was hazed with heat. He wandered back to the sitting area. There was a credenza in one corner, set up with a small coffee machine. There were two upturned mugs beside it, with spoons, like a hotel. The bathroom door was closed. The shower sounded loud behind it. He filled a mug with coffee and wandered into the dressing area. There were two large closets there, parallel, one on each side. Not walk-ins, just long deep alcoves screened with sliding doors made out of mirrored glass. He opened the left-hand closet. It was hers. It was full of dresses and pants on hangers. There were blouses. There was a rack of shoes. He closed it again and turned around and opened the other one. It was Sloop\u0027s. There were a dozen suits, and rows and rows of chinos and blue jeans. Cedar shelves stacked with T-shirts, and dress shirts folded into plastic wraps. A row of neckties. Belts, with fancy buckles. A long row of dusty shoes on the floor. The shoes looked to be about size eleven. He swapped his coffee cup into his other hand and nudged open a suit coat, looking for the label. It was a forty-four long. It would fit a guy about six feet two or three, maybe a hundred and ninety or two hundred pounds. So Sloop was not an especially big guy. Not a giant. But he was a foot taller and twice the weight of his wife. Not the world\u0027s fairest match-up. There was a photograph frame face-down on top of a stack of shirts. He turned it over. There was a five-by-seven color print under a cream card mat glassed into a lacquered wooden surround. The print showed three guys, young, halfway between boyhood and manhood. Maybe seventeen years old, maybe eighteen. They were standing close together, leaning on the bulging fender of an old-fashioned pick-up truck. They were peering expectantly at the camera, like maybe it was perched close by on a rock and they were waiting for the self-timer to click in. They looked full of youthful energy and excitement. Their whole lives ahead of them, full of infinite possibilities. One of them was Hack Walker, a little slimmer, a little more muscular, a lot more hair. He guessed the other two were Al Eugene and Sloop Greer himself. Teenaged buddies. Eugene was a head shorter than Sloop, and chubby. Sloop looked like a younger version of Bobby. He heard the shower shut off and put the photograph back and closed the slider. Moved back to the sitting area. A moment later the bathroom door opened and Carmen came out in a cloud of steam. She was wrapped in two white towels, one around her body, the other bound like a turban around her hair. He looked at her and stayed quiet, unsure of what to say. \"Good morning,\" she said in the silence. \"To you, too,\" he said. She unwrapped the turban and shook out her hair. It hung wet and straight. \"It isn\u0027t, though, is it?\" she said. \"A good morning? It\u0027s a bad morning.\" \"I guess,\" he said. \"He could be walking out the gate, this exact minute.\" He checked his watch. It was almost seven. \"Any time now,\" he said. \"Use the shower if you want,\" she said. \"I have to go and see to Ellie.\" \"O.K.\" He stepped into the bathroom. It was huge, and made out of some kind of reconstituted marble with gold tones in it. It looked like a place he\u0027d once stayed, in Vegas. He used the John and rinsed his mouth at the sink and stripped off his stale clothes and stepped into the shower stall. It was enclosed with bronze-tinted glass and it was enormous. There was a shower head the size of a hubcap above him, and tall pipes in each corner with additional water jets pointing directly at him. He turned the faucet and a huge roaring started up. Then a deluge of warm water hit him from all sides. It was like standing under Niagara Falls. The side jets started pulsing hot and cold and he couldn\u0027t hear himself think. He washed as quickly as he could and soaped his hair and rinsed off and shut it all down. He took a fresh towel from a stack and dried off as well as he could in the humidity. Wrapped the towel around him and stepped back into the dressing area. Carmen was buttoning her shirt. It was white, and she had white pants on. Gold jewelry. Her skin looked dark against it and her hair was glossy and already curling in the heat. \"That was quick,\" she said. \"Hell of a shower,\" he said. \"Sloop chose it,\" she said. \"I hate it. There\u0027s so much water, I can hardly breathe in there.\" She slid her closet shut and twisted left and right to examine her reflection in the mirrored doors. \"You look good,\" he said. \"Do I look Mexican enough?\" she asked. \"With the white clothes?\" He said nothing. \"No jeans today,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sick of trying to look like I was born a cowgirl in Amarillo.\" \"You look good,\" he said again. \"Seven hours,\" she said. \"Six and a half, if Hack drives fast.\" He nodded. \"I\u0027m going to find Bobby.\" She stretched tall and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thanks for staying,\" she said. \"It helped me.\" He said nothing. \"Join us for breakfast,\" she said. \"Twenty minutes.\" Then she walked slowly out of the room, on her way to wake her daughter. Reacher dressed and found a different way back into the house. The whole place was a warren. He came out through a living room he hadn\u0027t seen before and into the foyer with the mirror and the rifles. He opened the front door and stepped out on the porch. It was already hot. The sun was coming from low on his right, and it was casting harsh early shadows. The shadows made the yard look pocked and lumpy. He walked down to the barn and went in the door. The heat and the smell were as bad as ever, and the horses were awake and restless. But they were clean. They had water. Their feed troughs had been filled. He found Bobby asleep in an unoccupied stall, on a bed of clean straw. \"Rise and shine, little brother,\" he called. Bobby stirred and sat up, confused as to where he was, and why. Then he remembered, and went tense with resentment. His clothes were dirty and hay stalks clung to him all over. \"Sleep well?\" Reacher asked. \"They\u0027ll be back soon,\" Bobby said. \"Then what do you think is going to happen?\" Reacher smiled. \"You mean, am I going to tell them I made you clean out the barn and sleep in the straw?\" \"You couldn\u0027t tell them.\" \"No, I guess I couldn\u0027t,\" Reacher said. \"So are you going to tell them?\" Bobby said nothing. Reacher smiled again. \"No, I didn\u0027t think you would,\" he said. \"So stay in here until noontime, then I\u0027ll let you in the house to get cleaned up for the main event.\" \"What about breakfast?\" \"You don\u0027t get any.\" \"But I\u0027m hungry.\" \"So eat the horse food. Turns out there\u0027s bags and bags of it, after all.\" He went back to the kitchen and found the maid brewing coffee and heating a skillet. \"Pancakes,\" she said. \"And that will have to do. They\u0027ll want a big lunch, so that\u0027s where my morning is going.\" \"Pancakes are fine,\" he said. He walked on into the silent parlor and listened for sounds from above. Ellie and Carmen should be moving around somewhere. But he couldn\u0027t hear anything. He tried to map the house in his head, but the layout was too bizarre. Clearly it had started out a substantial ranch house, and then random additions had been made whenever necessary. Overall, there was no coherence to it. The maid came in with a stack of plates. Four of them, with four sets of silverware and four paper napkins piled on top. \"I assume you\u0027re eating in here,\" she said. Reacher nodded. \"But Bobby isn\u0027t. He\u0027s staying in the barn.\" \"Why?\" \"I think a horse is sick.\" The maid dumped the stack of plates and slid one out, leaving three of everything. \"So I\u0027ll have to carry it down to him, I guess,\" she said, irritated. \"I\u0027ll take it,\" Reacher said. \"You\u0027re very busy.\" He followed her back to the kitchen and she piled the first four pancakes off the skillet onto a plate. Added a little butter and maple syrup. Reacher wrapped a knife and a fork into a napkin and picked up the plate and walked back out into the heat. He found Bobby where he had left him. He was sitting up, doing nothing. \"What\u0027s this?\" he said. \"Breakfast,\" Reacher said. \"I had a change of heart. Because you\u0027re going to do something for me.\" \"Yeah, what?\" \"There\u0027s going to be some kind of a big lunch, for Sloop getting back.\" Bobby nodded. \"I expect so.\" \"You\u0027re going to invite me. As your guest. Like I\u0027m you\u0027re big buddy.\" \"I am?\" \"Sure you are. If you want these pancakes, and if you want to walk without sticks the rest of your life.\" Bobby went quiet. \"Dinner, too,\" Reacher said. \"You understand?\" \"Her husband\u0027s coming home, for God\u0027s sake,\" Bobby said. \"It\u0027s over, right?\" \"You\u0027re jumping to conclusions, Bobby. I\u0027ve got no particular interest in Carmen. I just want to get next to Sloop. I need to talk to him.\" \"About what?\" \"Just do it, O.K.?\" Bobby shrugged. \"Whatever,\" he said. Reacher handed him the plate of pancakes and headed for the house again. Carmen and Ellie were sitting side by side at the table. Ellie\u0027s hair was wet from the shower and she was in a yellow seersucker dress. \"My daddy\u0027s coming home today,\" she said. \"He\u0027s on his way, right now.\" Reacher nodded. \"I heard that.\" \"I thought it was going to be tomorrow. But it\u0027s today.\" Carmen was looking at the wall, saying nothing. The maid brought pancakes in on a platter. She served them out, two for the kid, three for Carmen, four for Reacher. Then she took the platter away and went back to the kitchen. \"I was going to stay home from school tomorrow,\" Ellie said. \"Can I still?\" Carmen said nothing. \"Mom? Can I still?\" Carmen turned and looked at Reacher, like he had spoken. Her face was blank. It reminded him of a guy he had known who had gone to the eye doctor. He had been having trouble reading fine print. The eye doctor spotted a tumor in the retina. Made arrangements there and then for him to have the eye removed the next day. Then the guy had sat around knowing that tomorrow he was going into the hospital with two eyes and coming back out with one. The certainty had burned him up. The anticipation. The dread. Much worse than a split-second accident with the same result. \"Mommy? Can I?\" Ellie asked again. \"I guess,\" Carmen said. \"What?\" \"Mommy, you\u0027re not listening. Are you excited too?\" \"Yes,\" Carmen said. \"So can I?\" \"Yes,\" Carmen said again. Ellie turned to her food and ate it like she was starving. Reacher picked at his, watching Carmen. She ate nothing. \"I\u0027m going to see my pony now,\" Ellie said. She scrambled off her chair and ran out of the room like a miniature whirlwind. Reacher heard the front door open and close and the thump of her shoes on the porch steps. He finished his breakfast while Carmen held her fork in midair, like she was uncertain what to do with it, like she had never seen one before. \"Will you talk to him?\" she asked. \"Sure,\" he said. \"I think he needs to know it\u0027s not a secret anymore.\" \"I agree.\" \"Will you look at him? When you\u0027re talking to him?\" \"I guess so,\" he said. \"Good. You should. Because you\u0027ve got gunfighter\u0027s eyes. Maybe like Clay Allison had. You should let him see them. Let him see what\u0027s coming.\" \"We\u0027ve been through all of that,\" he said. \"I know,\" she answered. Then she went off alone and Reacher set about killing time. It felt like waiting for an air raid. He walked out onto the porch and looked across the yard at the road where it came in from the north. He followed it with his eyes to where the red picket fence finished, and beyond that to where it disappeared over the curve of the earth. The air was still clear with morning and there was no mirage over the blacktop. It was just a dusty ribbon framed by the limestone ledge to the west and the power lines to the east. He turned back and sat down on the porch swing. The chains creaked under his weight. He settled sideways, facing the ranch gate, one leg up and the other on the floor. Then he did what most soldiers do when they\u0027re waiting for action. He went to sleep. Carmen woke him maybe an hour later. She touched him on the shoulder and he opened his eyes and saw her standing over him. She had changed her clothes. Now she was in pressed blue jeans and a checked shirt. She was wearing boots made out of lizard skin. A belt to match. Her hair was tied back and she had made up her face with pale powder and blue eye shadow. \"I changed my mind,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want you to talk to him. Not yet.\" \"Why not?\" \"It might set him off. If he knows somebody else knows.\" \"You didn\u0027t think that before.\" \"I thought it over again. I think it might be worse, if we start out like that. It\u0027s better coming from me. At least at first.\" \"You sure?\" She nodded. \"Let me talk to him, the first time.\" \"When?\" \"Tonight,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll tell you tomorrow how it went.\" He sat up, with both feet on the ground. \"You were pretty sure you\u0027d have a busted nose tomorrow,\" he said. \"I think this is best,\" she said. \"Why did you change your clothes?\" \"These are better,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to provoke him.\" \"You look like a cowgirl, born in Amarillo.\" \"He likes me like this.\" \"And dressing like who you are would provoke him?\" She made a face. A defeated face, he thought. \"Don\u0027t chicken out, Carmen,\" he said. \"Stand and fight instead.\" \"I will,\" she said. \"Tonight. I\u0027ll tell him I\u0027m not going to take it anymore.\" He said nothing. \"So don\u0027t talk to him today, O.K.?\" she said. He looked away. \"It\u0027s your call,\" he said. \"It\u0027s better this way.\" She went back into the house. Reacher stared north at the road. Sitting down, he could see a mile less of it. The heat was up, and the shimmer was starting. She woke him again after another hour. The clothes were the same, but she had removed the makeup. \"You think I\u0027m doing this wrong,\" she said. He sat up and rubbed both hands over his face, like he was washing. \"I think it would be better out in the open,\" he said. \"He should know somebody else knows. If not me, then his family, maybe.\" \"I can\u0027t tell them.\" \"No, I guess you can\u0027t.\" \"So what should I do?\" \"You should let me talk to him.\" \"Not right away. It would be worse. Promise me you won\u0027t.\" He nodded. \"It\u0027s your call,\" he said. \"But you promise me something, O.K.? Talk to him yourself, tonight. For sure. And if he starts anything, get out of the room and just scream your head off until we all come running. Scream the place down. Demand the cops. Shout for help. It\u0027ll embarrass him. It\u0027ll change the dynamic.\" \"You think?\" \"He can\u0027t pretend it isn\u0027t happening, not if everybody hears you.\" \"He\u0027ll deny it. He\u0027ll say I was just having a nightmare.\" \"But deep inside, he\u0027ll know we know.\" She said nothing. \"Promise me, Carmen,\" he said. \"Or I\u0027ll talk to him first.\" She was quiet for a moment. \"O.K., I promise you,\" she said. He settled back on the swing and tried to doze another hour. But his internal clock was telling him the time was getting near. The way he remembered the maps of Texas, Abilene was probably less than seven hours from Echo County. Probably nearer six, for a driver who was a DA and therefore a part of the law enforcement community and therefore relatively unconcerned about speeding tickets. So assuming Sloop got out at seven without any delay, they could be home by one o\u0027clock. And he probably would get out without any delay, because a minimum-security federal facility wouldn\u0027t have a whole lot of complicated procedures. They\u0027d just make a check mark on a clipboard and cut him loose. He guessed it was nearly twelve and looked at his watch to confirm it. It was one minute past. He saw Bobby come out of the horse barn and start up the track past the car barn. He was carrying his breakfast plate, blinking in the sun, walking like his limbs were stiff. He crossed the yard and stepped up on the porch. Said nothing. Just walked on into the house and closed the door behind him. About twelve-thirty, Ellie came wandering up from the direction of the corrals. Her yellow dress was all covered in dirt and sand. Her hair was matted with it and her skin was flushed from the heat. \"I\u0027ve been jumping,\" she said. \"I pretend I\u0027m a horse and I go around and around the jumps as fast as I can.\" \"Come here,\" Reacher said. She stood close and he dusted her down, brushing the sand and the dirt to the floor with his palm. \"Maybe you should go shower again,\" he said. \"Get your hair clean.\" \"Why?\" \"So you look nice, for your daddy getting home.\" She thought about it, with intense concentration. \"O.K.,\" she said. \"Be quick.\" She looked at him for a moment, and then she turned and ran into the house. At a quarter to one, Bobby came outside. He was clean and dressed in fresh jeans and a new T-shirt. He had alligator boots on his feet. They had silver accents at the toe. He was wearing another red ball cap. It was backward on his head, and it had a flash on the side reading Division Series 1999. \"They lost, right?\" Reacher said. \"Who?\" \"The Texas Rangers. In the 1999 Division Series. To the Yankees.\" \"So?\" \"So nothing, Bobby.\" Then the door opened again and Carmen and Ellie came out together. Carmen was still in the cowgirl outfit. She had the makeup on again. Ellie was still in the yellow seersucker. Her hair was wet and tied back into a ponytail with a ribbon. Carmen was holding her hand and staggering slightly, like her knees were weak. Reacher stood up and gestured that she should sit down. Ellie climbed up and sat next to her. Nobody spoke. Reacher stepped to the porch rail and watched the road. He could see all the way to where the power lines disappeared in the haze. Maybe five miles north. Maybe ten. It was hard to be certain. He was deep in the shadow of the porch, and the world was hot and white in front of him. He saw the dust cloud right at the extremity of his vision. It smudged in the haze and hung and drifted east, like a faint desert breeze was catching it and pushing it over toward Greer land. It grew until he could make out its shape. It was a long yellow teardrop of dust, rising and falling, dodging left and right with the curves of the road. It grew to a mile long, and many generations of it bloomed and dissipated before it came close enough for him to see the lime green Lincoln at its head. It came up over a contour in the road and shimmered through the haze and slowed where the barbed wire gave way to the red picket fence. It looked dusty and tired and travel-stained. It braked hard close to the gate and the front end squatted as the suspension compressed. It turned in sharply. The cone of dust behind it drifted straight on south, like it had been outwitted by the abrupt change of direction. There was a crunch of dirt and gravel and the sun flashed once in the windshield as the car came through its turn, and then three figures were clearly visible inside. Hack Walker was at the wheel.
