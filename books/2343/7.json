{"id":66011,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"He had seen the feed bags in the storeroom. There were plenty of them, maybe forty, in head-high stacks. Big waxed-paper bags, probably thirty pounds to a bag. Altogether twelve hundred pounds of feed. About half a ton. How fast were four horses and a pony going to eat their way through all of that?\\n\\n But he had always understood the trip was Bobby\u0027s idea of a diversion. Buying more feed before it was strictly necessary was as good a way as any of getting him out of Carmen\u0027s life for a spell. But they weren\u0027t buying more feed. Because they had turned left. The bags were all printed with a brand name and nutritional boasts and the name and the address of the feed supplier. The feed supplier was in San Angelo. He had seen it repeated forty times, once on each bag, in big clear letters. San Angelo, San Angelo, San Angelo. And San Angelo was north and east of Echo County. Way north and east. Not south and west. They should have turned right.\\n\\n So, Bobby was planning to get him out of Carmen\u0027s life permanently. Josh and Billy had been told to get rid of him. And Josh and Billy will do what they\u0027re told, Bobby had said. He smiled at the windshield. Forewarned is forearmed. They didn\u0027t know he\u0027d seen the feed bags, didn\u0027t know he\u0027d read the writing on them, and they didn\u0027t know he\u0027d been looking at maps of Texas for most of the last week. They didn\u0027t know a left turn instead of a right would mean anything to him.\\n\\n How would they aim to do it? Carmen had implied her out-of-work teacher friend had been scared off. Scared pretty badly, if he wouldn\u0027t even talk to her later, up in the relative safety of Pecos. So were they going to try to scare him? If so, they really had to be kidding. He felt the aggression building inside. He used it and controlled it like he had learned to. He used the adrenaline flow to ease the stiffness in his legs. He let it pump him up. He flexed his shoulders, leaning on Josh on one side, Billy on the other. \"How far is it?\" he asked innocently.\\n\\n \"Couple hours,\" Billy said.\\n\\n They were doing about sixty, heading south on the dead-straight road. The landscape was unchanging. Scrubby dry grassland on the left, sullen limestone caliche on the right, broken up into ledges and layers. All of it baking under the relentless sun. There was no traffic. The road looked like it saw one or two vehicles a day. Maybe all they had to do was get far enough away, pull over, throw him out, and he\u0027d die slowly of thirst before anybody got to him. Or of exhaustion, walking back. Or of rattlesnake bites.\\n\\n \"No, less than a couple hours,\" Josh said. \"Hundred miles is all.\"\\n\\n So maybe they were headed to the bar they had mentioned yesterday. Maybe they had friends there. They better had, Reacher thought. A pair of fifth-rate cowboys ain\u0027t going to do it for me. Then he breathed out again. Relaxed. Struggled with a decision. The problem with the kind of undiluted raging aggression he had described to Carmen was it came out so all-or-nothing. He recalled his first day in high school. The summer after he finished his elementary education, the family moved back stateside for a six-month tour. He was enrolled in a big high school off-base, somewhere in New Jersey, somewhere near Fort Dix. And he was ready for it. In his usual serious earnest fashion he calculated that high school would be bigger and better than elementary school, in every way, including the seriousness of the locker-room scuffling. So he made his usual new-school first-day plan to jump on the very first guy who tried anything. That had always worked well for him. Hit hard, hit early, get your retaliation in first. It made a big impression. But this time, make an even bigger impression, hit harder than ever, because clearly high school was going to be a whole new kind of a deal.\\n\\n So sure enough some hard kid shoved him the first morning, and ten minutes later the hard kid was on his way to the hospital for a three-week stay. Then Reacher discovered it was really a very genteel school, in a good neighborhood, and that he\u0027d reacted way too drastically, and everybody was looking at him like he was some sort of a barbarian. And he felt like one. He felt a little ashamed. From then on, he\u0027d become calmer. He\u0027d learned to be certain what he was into before he did anything. And he\u0027d learned to offer warnings, sometimes, in certain circumstances.\\n\\n \"We coming straight back?\" he asked.\\n\\n It was a smart tactical question. They couldn\u0027t say no, without alerting him. They couldn\u0027t say yes, if they weren\u0027t going there in the first place. \"We\u0027re going for a couple beers first,\" Billy said.\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"Where we went yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m broke,\" Reacher said. \"I didn\u0027t get paid yet.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re buying,\" Josh said.\\n\\n \"The feed store open late? On a Saturday?\"\\n\\n \"Big order, they\u0027ll accommodate us,\" Billy said. Maybe it was a new supplier. Maybe they changed their source.\\n\\n \"I guess you use them a lot,\" he said.\\n\\n \"All the years we\u0027ve been here,\" Josh said.\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027re going straight back?\"\\n\\n \"Sure we are,\" Billy said. \"You\u0027ll be back in time for your beauty sleep.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" Reacher said. He paused. \"Because that\u0027s the way I like it,\" he said. Mess with me now, you get what you get. Billy said nothing. Josh just smiled and drove.\\n\\n The scenery flattened very gradually as they headed south. From his time with the maps he knew the Rio Grande was curling around toward them from the west. They were entering the river basin, where wide prehistoric waters had scoured the land. Josh kept the speed at a steady sixty. Billy stared idly out of his window. The road remained straight and featureless. Reacher rested his head on the gun rack behind him and waited. Waiting was something he was accustomed to. Many times in his career, frantic action had been preceded by a long drive. It usually happened that way. The patient accumulation of evidence, the arrival at a conclusion, the identification of a suspect, the drive out to deal with him. Waiting was a skill you learned fast, in the military.\\n\\n The road got rougher the farther south they drove. The truck labored over it. The load bed was empty, so the rear wheels bounced and skipped. There were vultures on some of the telephone poles. The sun was low in the west. There was a sign on the shoulder. It said ECHO 5 MILES. It was pocked with bullet holes.\\n\\n \"I thought Echo was north,\" Reacher said. \"Where Ellie goes to school.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s split,\" Billy said. \"Half of it up there, half of it down here. Hundred sixty miles of nothing in between.\"\\n\\n \"World\u0027s biggest town, end to end,\" Josh said. \"Bigger than Los Angeles.\"\\n\\n He eased off the gas around a long slow curve and a cluster of small buildings came into view in the distance, all of them built low to the ground, all of them lit from behind by the low sun. There were tin advertisements on the shoulder, three miles out, announcing well in advance what the buildings were going to be. There was going to be another gas station, and a country store. And a bar, called the Longhorn Lounge, owned and operated by somebody named Harley. It had the last sign, but it was the first establishment they came to. It was a hundred feet east of the shoulder of the road, built out of tarred boards under an iron roof, crouched low at an angle in the middle of two acres of parched earth. There were ten or twelve pick-up trucks parked nose-in to the building like airplanes at a terminal. And nearest the door was the sheriff\u0027s secondhand police car, just sitting there like it had been abandoned.\\n\\n Josh bumped across the parking lot and put the truck in line with the others. The bar had neon beer signs in the windows, trapped between dirty glass and faded gingham drapes. Josh turned the motor off. Put the keys in his pocket. In the sudden quiet Reacher could hear bar noise, the roar of extractor fans and air conditioners, the thump of an overworked jukebox amplifier, the rumble of talking, the chink of bottles and glasses, the click of pool balls. Sounded like a reasonable crowd in there.\\n\\n Josh and Billy opened their doors together and swung out. Reacher slid out through the passenger door and stood with his back to the sun. It was still hot. He could feel heat all over him, right from the back of his neck to the heels of his shoes.\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" Billy said. \"We\u0027re buying.\"\\n\\n There was an inside lobby with an old-fashioned pay phone and scrawled numbers and old messages creeping over the boards alongside it. Then there was a second door, with a yellow glass window in it, that led into the bar itself. Billy pushed it open.\\n\\n For a military cop, walking into a bar is like a batter stepping to the plate. It\u0027s his place of business. Maybe ninety percent of low-grade trouble in the service happens in bars. Put a bunch of young men trained for aggression and reaction alongside a limitless supply of alcohol, add in unit rivalries, add in the presence of civilian women and their civilian husbands and boyfriends, and it becomes inevitable. So just like a batter walks warily from the on-deck circle, watching the infield, surveying the outfield, calculating angles and distances, a military cop is all eyes on the way into a bar. First, he counts the exits. There are usually three. The front door, the back door out beyond the rest rooms, and the private door from the office behind the bar. Reacher saw that the Longhorn Lounge had all three of them. The windows were too small to be useful to anybody.\\n\\n Then the MP looks at the crowd. He looks for knots of trouble. Who falls silent and stares? Where are the challenges? Nowhere, in the Longhorn. There were maybe twenty or twenty-five people in the long low room, all men, all tanned and lean and dressed in denim, none of them paying any kind of attention beyond casual glances and nods of easy familiarity toward Billy and Josh. The sheriff was nowhere to be seen. But there was an unoccupied stool at the bar with a fresh bottle sitting on a used napkin in front of it. Maybe the place of honor.\\n\\n Then the MP looks for weapons. There was an antique revolver above the bar, wired onto a wooden plaque with a message branded into it with a hot poker: WE DON\u0027T CALL 911. There would be a few modern handguns here and there in the room. There were long-neck bottles all over the place, but Reacher wasn\u0027t worried about them. Bottles are no real use as weapons. Except in the movies, where they make them out of spun sugar and print the labels on tissue paper. A real bottle won\u0027t break against a table top. The glass is too thick. They just make a loud banging noise. They have some marginal use as clubs, but the pool table worried him more. It sat in the middle of the room, all covered in hard celluloid balls, four guys with four cues using it, maybe a dozen more cues vertical in a long rack on the nearest wall. Short of a shotgun, a pool cue is the best barroom weapon ever invented. Short enough to be handy, long enough to be useful, made out of fine hardwood and nicely weighted with lead.\\n\\n The air was unnaturally cold and thick with beer fumes and smoke and noise. The jukebox was near the pool table, and beyond it was an area with small round lounge tables surrounded by stools padded with red vinyl. Billy held up three fingers to the barman and got three cold bottles in exchange. He carried them laced between his fingers and led the way toward the tables. Reacher stepped ahead of him and got there first. He wanted his choice of seats. Back to the wall was his rule. All three exits in view, if possible. He threaded his way in and sat down. Josh sat to his half-right, and Billy sat half-left. Pushed a bottle across the scarred surface of the table. People had stubbed cigarettes on the wood. The sheriff came into the room from the rear, from the direction of the rest rooms, checking that his pants were zipped. He paused a second when he saw Reacher, nothing in his face, and then he moved on and sat down at the bar, on the unoccupied stool, his shoulders hunched, his back to the crowd.\\n\\n Billy raised his bottle like a toast.\\n\\n \"Good luck,\" he said.\\n\\n You\u0027re going to need it, pal, Reacher thought. He took a long pull from his own bottle. The beer was cold and gassy. It tasted strongly of hops.\\n\\n \"I need to make a phone call,\" Billy said.\\n\\n He pushed back from the table and stood up again. Josh leaned to his right, trying to fill the new vacant space in front of Reacher. Billy made it through the crowd and went outside to the lobby. Reacher took another sip of his beer and estimated the passage of time. And counted the people in the room. There were twenty-three of them, excluding himself, including the barman, who he guessed was Harley. Billy came back inside two minutes and forty seconds. He bent and spoke into the sheriff\u0027s ear. The sheriff nodded. Billy spoke some more. The sheriff nodded again. Drained his bottle and pushed back from the bar and stood up. Turned to face the room. Glanced once in Reacher\u0027s direction and then stepped away and pushed out through the door. Billy stood and watched him go and then threaded his way back to the table.\\n\\n \"Sheriff\u0027s leaving,\" he said. \"He remembered he had urgent business elsewhere.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"Did you make your call?\" Josh asked, like it was rehearsed.\\n\\n \"Yes, I made my call,\" Billy said. Then he sat down on his stool and picked up his bottle. \"Don\u0027t you want to know who I called?\" he said, looking across at Reacher.\\n\\n \"Why would I give a rat\u0027s ass who you called?\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"I called for the ambulance,\" Billy said. \"Best to do it ahead of time, because it comes all the way from Presidio. It can take hours to get here.\"\\n\\n \"See, we got a confession to make,\" Josh said. \"We lied to you before. There was a guy we ran off. He was knocking boots with the Mexican woman. Bobby didn\u0027t think that was appropriate behavior, in the circumstances, what with Sloop being in prison and all. So we got asked to take care of it. We brought him down here.\"\\n\\n \"Want to know what we did?\" Billy asked.\\n\\n \"I thought we were going to the feed store,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"Feed store\u0027s up in San Angelo.\"\\n\\n \"So what are we doing all the way down here?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re telling you, is what. This is where we brought the other guy.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this other guy got to do with me?\"\\n\\n \"Bobby figures you\u0027re in the same category, is what.\"\\n\\n \"He thinks I\u0027m knocking boots with her too?\"\\n\\n Josh nodded. \"He sure does.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"We agree with him. Why else would you come around? You\u0027re no horseman, that\u0027s for damn sure.\"\\n\\n \"Suppose I told you we\u0027re just good friends?\"\\n\\n \"Bobby says you\u0027re more than that.\"\\n\\n \"And you believe him?\"\\n\\n Billy nodded. \"Sure we do. She conies on to him. He told us that himself. So why should you be any different? And hey, we don\u0027t blame you. She\u0027s a good-looking piece of ass. I\u0027d go there myself, except she\u0027s Sloop\u0027s. You got to respect family, even with beaners. That\u0027s the rule around here.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"Her other guy was a schoolteacher,\" Billy said. \"Got way out of line. So we brought him down here, and we took him out back, in the yard, and we got us a hog butchering knife, and we got us a couple of guys to hold him, and we pulled his pants down, and we told him we were going to cut it off. He was all crying and whimpering and messing himself. Begging and whining. Promising he\u0027d get himself lost. Pleading with us not to cut. But we cut just a little anyway. For the fun of it. There was blood everywhere. Then we let him go. But we told him if we ever saw his face again, we\u0027d take it all the way off for real. And you know what? We never saw his face again.\"\\n\\n \"So it worked,\" Josh said. \"It worked real good. Only problem was he nearly bled out, from the wound. We should have qalled ahead for the ambulance. We figured we should remember that, for the next time. Live and learn, that\u0027s what we always say. So this time, we did call ahead. Especially for you. So you should be grateful.\"\\n\\n \"You cut the guy?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"We sure did.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like you\u0027re real proud of yourselves.\"\\n\\n \"We do what it takes. We look after the family.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re admitting it to me?\"\\n\\n Josh nodded. \"Why shouldn\u0027t we? Like, who the hell are you?\"\\n\\n Reacher shrugged. \"Well, I\u0027m not a schoolteacher.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\\n\\n \"It means you aim to cut me, it\u0027ll be you goes in the ambulance.\"\\n\\n \"You think?\"\\n\\n Reacher nodded. \"That horse I was on shit more trouble than you guys are going to give me.\"\\n\\n He looked at each of them in turn, openly and evenly. Serene self-confidence works wonders, in a situation like that. And he felt confident. It was confidence born of experience. It was a long, long time since he\u0027d lost a two-on-one bar fight.\\n\\n \"Your choice,\" he said. \"Quit now, or go to the hospital.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you know what?\" Josh said, smiling. \"I think we\u0027ll stay with the program. Because whatever the hell kind of a guy you think you are, we\u0027re the ones got a lot of friends in here. And you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t inquire about your social situation,\" Reacher said. But it was clearly true. They had friends in there. Some kind of a subliminal vibe was quieting the room, making people restless and watchful. They were glancing over, then glancing at each other. The atmosphere was building. The pool game was slowing down. Reacher could feel tension in the air. The silences were starting. The challenges. Maybe it was going to be worse than two-on-one. Maybe a lot worse. Billy smiled.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t scare easy,\" he said. \"Call it a professional thing.\"\\n\\n They get in the ring with bulls that weigh a ton and a half, Bobby had said. They ain\u0027t going to be too worried about you. Reacher had never been to a rodeo. He knew nothing about them, except for occasional passing impressions from television or the movies. He guessed the riders sat on some kind of a fence, near the pen, and they jumped on just as the bull was released out into the ring. Then they had to stay on. What was it, eight seconds? And if they didn\u0027t, they could get kicked around pretty badly. They could get stomped. Or gored, with the horns. So these guys had some kind of dumb courage. And strength. And resilience. And they were accustomed to pain and injury. But they were also accustomed to some kind of a pattern. Some kind of a structured buildup. Some kind of a measured countdown, before the action suddenly started. He didn\u0027t know for sure how it went. Maybe three, two, one, go. Maybe ten, nine, eight. Whatever, they were accustomed to waiting, counting off the seconds, tensing up, breathing deeply, getting ready for it.\\n\\n \"So let\u0027s do it,\" he said. \"Right now, in the yard.\"\\n\\n He came out from behind the table and stepped past Josh before he could react. Walked ahead, away from the jukebox, to the right of the pool table, heading for the rest room exit. Knots of people blocked him and then parted to let him through. He heard Josh and Billy following right behind him. He felt them counting down, tensing up, getting ready. Maybe twenty paces to the exit, maybe thirty seconds to the yard. Twenty-nine, twenty-eight. He kept his steps even, building on the rhythm. Twenty-seven, twenty-six. Arms loose by his side.\\n\\n Twenty-five, twenty-four.\\n\\n He snatched the last pool cue from the rack and reversed it in his hands and scythed a complete hundred-eighty-degree turn and hit Billy as hard as he could in the side of the head, one. There was a loud crunch of bone clearly audible over the jukebox noise and a spray of blood and Billy went down like he had been machine-gunned. He swung again, chopping full-force at Josh like a slugger swinging for the fences, two. Josh\u0027s hand came up to block the blow and his forearm broke clean in half. He screamed and Reacher swung again for the head, three, connecting hard, knocking him sideways. He jabbed for the face and punched out a couple of teeth, four. Backhanded the cue with all his strength against the upper arm and shattered the bone, five. Josh went down head-to-toe with Billy and Reacher stood over them both and swung again four more times, fast and hard, six, seven, eight, nine, against ribs and collarbones and knees and skulls. A total of nine swings, maybe six or seven seconds of furious explosive force. Hit hard, hit early, get your retaliation in first. While they\u0027re still waiting for the bell.\\n\\n The other men in the bar had spun away from the action and now they were crowding back in again, slowly and warily. Reacher turned a menacing circle with the cue held ready. He bent and took the truck keys from Josh\u0027s pocket. Then he dropped the cue and let it clatter to the floor and barged his way through the crowd to the door, breathing hard, shoving people out of his way. Nobody seriously tried to stop him. Clearly friendship had its limits, down there in Echo County. He made it into the lot, still breathing fast. The heat broke him out in a sweat, instantly. He made it back to the truck. Slid inside and fired it up and backed away from the building and peeled away north. The bar door stayed firmly closed. Nobody came after him.\\n\\n The Sun set far away in the west an hour into his drive back and it was full dark when he turned in under the ranch gate. But every light in the Red House was burning. And there were two cars parked in the yard. One was the sheriff\u0027s secondhand cruiser. The other was a lime green Lincoln. The sheriff\u0027s car was flashing red and blue. The Lincoln was lit by the spill from the porch and the hot yellow light made it look the color of a dead man\u0027s skin. There were clouds of moths everywhere, big papery insects crowding the bulbs above the porch like tiny individual snowstorms, forming and re-forming as they fluttered from one to the next. Behind them the chant of the night insects was already rhythmic and insistent.\\n\\n The front door of the house was standing open and there was noise in the foyer. Loud excited conversation, from a small crowd of people. Reacher stepped up and looked into the room and saw the sheriff, and Rusty Greer, and Bobby, and then Carmen standing alone near the rack of rifles. She had changed out of her jeans and shirt. She was wearing a dress. It was red and black and had no sleeves. It finished at the knee. She looked numb. Conflicting emotions in her face made it blank and expressionless. There was a man in a suit at the opposite end of the room, standing near the red-framed mirror so Reacher could see the front and back of him at the same time. The Lincoln driver, obviously. He was sleek and slightly overweight, not short, not tall, dressed in pressed seersucker. Maybe thirty years old, with light-colored hair carefully combed and receding from a domed brow. He had a pale indoor face, red with sunburn on the upward-facing planes like he played golf in the early afternoon. The face was split into a huge politician\u0027s smile. He looked like he had been receiving fulsome accolades and pretending they were completely unnecessary.\\n\\n Reacher paused on the porch and decided not to enter. But his weight put a loud creak into the boards and Bobby heard it. He glanced out into the night and did a perfect double-take. Stood completely still for a second and then came hurrying through the door. Took Reacher\u0027s elbow and pulled him into the lee of the wall, alongside the entrance, out of sight of the foyer.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I work here,\" Reacher said. \"Remember?\"\\n\\n \"Where are Josh and Billy?\"\\n\\n \"They quit.\"\\n\\n Bobby stared at him. \"They what?\"\\n\\n \"They quit,\" Reacher said again.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"It means they decided they didn\u0027t want to work here anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Why would they do that?\"\\n\\n Reacher shrugged. \"How would I know? Maybe they were just exercising their prerogative inside a free labor market.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing. Bobby\u0027s absence and the voices on the porch had pulled people to the door. Rusty Greer was first out, followed by the sheriff and the guy in the seersucker suit. Carmen stayed inside, near the rifles, still looking numb. They all fell silent, looking at Reacher, Rusty like she had a social difficulty to deal with, the sheriff puzzled, the new guy in the suit wondering who the hell this stranger was.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Rusty asked.\\n\\n \"This guy says Josh and Billy quit on us,\" Bobby said.\\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t do that,\" Rusty said. \"Why would they do that?\" The guy in the suit was looming forward, like he expected to be introduced. \"Did they give a reason?\" Rusty asked.\\n\\n The sheriff was looking straight at Reacher, nothing in his face. Reacher made no reply. Just stood there, waiting.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m Hack Walker,\" the guy in the suit said, in a big honest voice, holding out his hand. \"I\u0027m the DA up in Pecos, and I\u0027m a friend of the family.\"\\n\\n \"Sloop\u0027s oldest friend,\" Rusty said, absently.\\n\\n Reacher nodded and took the guy\u0027s hand. \"Jack Reacher,\" he said. \"I work here.\"\\n\\n The guy held on to his hand in both of his own and beamed a subtle little smile that was partly genuine, partly you-know-how-it-is ironic. A perfect politician\u0027s smile.\\n\\n \"You registered to vote here yet?\" he asked. \"Because if so, I just want to point out I\u0027m running for judge in November, and I\u0027d surely like to count on your support.\"\\n\\n Then he started up with a self-deprecating chuckle, a man secure among friends, amused about how the demands of democracy can intrude on good manners. You know how it is. Reacher took his hand back and nodded without speaking.\\n\\n \"Hack\u0027s worked so hard for us,\" Rusty said. \"And now he\u0027s brought us the most delightful news.\"\\n\\n \"Al Eugene showed up?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"No, not yet,\" Rusty said. \"Something else entirely.\"\\n\\n \"And nothing to do with the election,\" Hack said. \"You folks all understand that, don\u0027t you? I agree, November time makes us want to do something for everybody, but you know I\u0027d have done this for you anyhow.\"\\n\\n \"And you know we\u0027d all vote for you anyhow, Hack,\" Rusty said.\\n\\n Then everybody started beaming at everybody else. Reacher glanced beyond them at Carmen standing alone in the foyer. She wasn\u0027t beaming.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting Sloop out early,\" he said. \"Tomorrow, I guess.\"\\n\\n Hack Walker ducked his head, like Reacher had offered him a compliment.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for sure,\" he said. \"All along they claimed they couldn\u0027t do administration on the weekend, but I managed to change their minds. They said it would be the first Sunday release in the history of the system, but I just said hey, there\u0027s a first time for everything.\"\\n\\n \"Hack\u0027s going to drive us up there,\" Rusty said. \"We\u0027re leaving soon. We\u0027re going to drive all night.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to be waiting on the sidewalk,\" Hack said. \"Right outside the prison gate, seven o\u0027clock in the morning. Old Sloop\u0027s going to get a big welcome.\"\\n\\n \"You all going?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" Carmen said.\\n\\n She had come out onto the porch, quietly, like a wraith. She was standing with her feet together, both hands on the railing, leaning forward from the waist, elbows locked, staring north at the black horizon.\\n\\n \"I have to stay and see to Ellie,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Plenty of room in the car,\" Hack said. \"Ellie can come too.\"\\n\\n Carmen shook her head. \"I don\u0027t want her to see her father walking out of a prison door.\"\\n\\n \"Well, please yourself,\" Rusty said. \"He\u0027s only your husband, after all.\"\\n\\n Carmen made no reply. Just shivered slightly, like the night air was thirty degrees instead of ninety.\\n\\n \"Then I guess I\u0027ll stay too,\" Bobby said. \"Keep an eye on things. Sloop will understand.\"\\n\\n Reacher glanced at him. Carmen turned abruptly and walked back into the house. Rusty and Hack Walker drifted after her. The sheriff and Bobby stayed on the porch, each taking a half-step toward the other, to put a subliminal human barrier between Reacher and the door.\\n\\n \"So why did they quit?\" Bobby asked.\\n\\n Reacher glanced at them both and shrugged.\\n\\n \"Well, they didn\u0027t exactly quit,\" he said. \"I was trying to sugar the pill, for the family, was all. Truth is we were in a bar, and they picked a fight with some guy... You saw us in the bar, right, Sheriff?\"\\n\\n The sheriff nodded, cautiously.\\n\\n \"It was after you left,\" Reacher said. \"They picked a fight and lost.\"\\n\\n \"Who with?\" Bobby asked. \"What guy?\"\\n\\n \"The wrong guy.\"\\n\\n \"But who was he?\"\\n\\n \"Some big guy,\" Reacher said. \"He smacked them around for a minute or two. I think somebody called the ambulance for them. They\u0027re probably in the hospital now. Maybe they\u0027re dead, for all I know. They lost, and they lost real bad.\"\\n\\n Bobby stared. \"Who was the guy?\"\\n\\n \"Just some guy, minding his own business.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Some stranger, I guess.\"\\n\\n Bobby paused. \"Was it you?\"\\n\\n \"Me?\" Reacher said. \"Why would they pick a fight with me?\"\\n\\n Bobby said nothing.\\n\\n \"Why would they pick a fight with me, Bobby?\" Reacher asked again. \"What possible kind of a reason would they have for that?\"\\n\\n Bobby made no reply. Just stared and then turned and stalked into the house. Slammed the door loudly behind him. The sheriff stayed where he was. \"So they got hurt bad,\" he said.\\n\\n Reacher nodded. \"Seems that way. You should make some calls, check it out. Then start spreading the news. Tell people that\u0027s what happens, if they start picking fights with the wrong strangers.\"\\n\\n The sheriff nodded again, still cautious.\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s something you should bear in mind, too,\" Reacher said. \"Bobby told me down here folks sort out their own differences. He told me they\u0027re reluctant to involve law enforcement people. He implied cops stay out of private disputes. He said it\u0027s some kind of a big old West Texas tradition.\"\\n\\n The sheriff was quiet for a moment. \"I guess it might be,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Bobby said it definitely was. A definite tradition.\"\\n\\n The sheriff turned away. \"Well, you could put it that way,\" he said. \"And I\u0027m a very traditional guy.\"\\n\\n Reacher nodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m very glad to hear it,\" he said.\\n\\n The sheriff paused on the porch steps, and then moved on again without looking back. He slid into his car and killed the flashing lights and started the engine. Maneuvered carefully past the lime green Lincoln and headed out down the driveway and under the gate. His engine was running rich. Reacher could smell unburned gasoline in the air, and he could hear the muffler popping with tiny explosions. Then the car accelerated into the distance and he could hear nothing at all except the grasshoppers clicking and chattering.\\n\\n He came down off the porch and walked around to the kitchen door. It was standing open, either for ventilation or so the maid could eavesdrop on the excitement. She was standing just inside the room, close to an insect screen made of plastic strips hanging down in the doorway.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Reacher said. He had learned long ago to be friendly with the cookhouse detail. That way, you eat better.\\n\\n But she didn\u0027t answer him. She just stood there, warily.\\n\\n \"Let me guess,\" he said. \"You only made two suppers for the bunkhouse.\"\\n\\n She said nothing, which was as good as a yes.\\n\\n \"You were misinformed,\" he said. \"Was it Bobby?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"He told me you weren\u0027t coming back.\"\\n\\n \"He was mistaken,\" he said. \"It was Josh and Billy who didn\u0027t come back. So I guess I\u0027ll eat their dinners. Both of them. I\u0027m hungry.\"\\n\\n She paused. Then she shrugged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bring them down,\" she said. \"In a minute.\"\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll eat them here,\" he said. \"Save you the walk.\"\\n\\n He parted the plastic strips with the backs of his hands and stepped inside the kitchen. It smelled of chili, left over from lunchtime.\\n\\n \"What did you make?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Steaks,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Good,\" he said. \"I like bovines better than edentates.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I like beef better than I like armadillo.\"\\n\\n \"So do I,\" she said.\\n\\n She used pot holders and took two plates out of a warming oven. Each held a medium-sized rib-eye steak, and a large mound of mashed potato and a smaller mound of fried onions. She put them side by side on the kitchen table, with a fork on the left of the left-hand plate and a knife all the way to the right, it looked like a double-barreled meal.\\n\\n \"Billy was my cousin,\" she said.\\n\\n \"He probably still is,\" Reacher said. \"Josh got it worse.\"\\n\\n \"Josh was my cousin, too.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\\n\\n \"Different branch of the family,\" she said. \"More distant. And they were both fools.\"\\n\\n Reacher nodded. \"Not the sharpest chisels in the box.\"\\n\\n \"But the Greers are sharp,\" she said. \"Whatever it is you\u0027re doing with the Mexican woman, you should remember that.\"\\n\\n Then she left him alone to eat.\\n\\n He rinsed both plates when he finished and left them stacked in the sink. Walked down to the horse barn and sat down to wait in the foul heat inside because he wanted to stay close to the house. He sat on a hay bale and kept his back to the horses. They were restless for a spell, and then they got used to his presence. He heard them fall asleep, one by one. The shuffling hooves stopped moving and he heard lazy huffs of breath.\\n\\n Then he heard feet over on the boards of the porch, and then on the steps, and then the crunch of dry dust under them as they crossed the yard. He heard the Lincoln\u0027s doors open, then shut again. He heard the engine start, and the transmission engage. He stood up and stepped to the barn door and saw the Lincoln turning around in front of the house. It was lit from behind by the porch lights, and he could see Hack Walker silhouetted at the wheel, with Rusty Greer beside him. The porch lights turned her teased-up hair to cotton candy. He could see the shape of her skull underneath it.\\n\\n The big car drove straight out under the gate and swooped right without pausing and accelerated away down the road. He watched the bright cone of its headlights through the picket fence, bouncing left to right through the darkness. Then it was gone and the sounds of the night insects came back and the big moths around the lights were all that was moving.\\n\\n He waited just inside the barn door, trying to guess who would come for him first. Carmen, probably, he thought, but it was Bobby who stepped out on the porch, maybe five minutes after his mother had left to bring his brother home. He came straight down the steps and headed across the yard, down toward the path to the bunkhouse. He had his ball cap on again, reversed on his head. Reacher stepped out of the barn and cut him off.\\n\\n \"Horses need watering,\" Bobby said. \"And I want their stalls cleaned out.\"\\n\\n \"You do it,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You heard.\"\\n\\n Bobby stood still. \"I\u0027m not doing it,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll make you do it.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell is this?\"\\n\\n \"A change, is what,\" Reacher said. \"Things just changed for you, Bobby, big time, believe me. Soon as you decided to set Josh and Billy on me, you crossed a line. Put yourself in a whole different situation. One where you do exactly what I tell you.\"\\n\\n Bobby said nothing.\\n\\n Reacher looked straight at him. \"I tell you jump, you don\u0027t even ask how high. You just start jumping. That clear? I own you now.\"\\n\\n Bobby stood still. Reacher swung his right hand, aiming a big slow roundhouse slap. Bobby ducked away from it, straight into Reacher\u0027s left, which pulled the ball cap off his head.\\n\\n \"So go look after the horses,\" Reacher said. \"Then you can sleep in there with them. I see you again before breakfast time, I\u0027ll break your legs.\"\\n\\n Bobby stood still.\\n\\n \"Who are you going to call, little brother?\" Reacher asked him. \"The maid, or the sheriff?\"\\n\\n Bobby said nothing. The vastness of the night closed in. Echo County, a hundred and fifty souls, most of them at least sixty or a hundred miles beyond the black horizons. The absolute definition of isolation.\\n\\n \"O.K.,\" Bobby said quietly.\\n\\n He walked slowly toward the barn. Reacher dropped the ball cap in the dirt and strolled up to the house, with the porch lights shining in his eyes and the big papery moths swarming out to greet him.\\n\\n Two thirds of the killing crew saw him stroll. They were doing it better than the watchers had. The woman had checked the map and rejected the tactic of driving in from the west. For one thing, the Crown Vic wouldn\u0027t make it over the desert terrain. For another, to hide a mile away made no sense at all. Especially during the hours of darkness. Far better to drive straight down the road and stop a hundred yards shy of the house, long enough for two of the team to jump out, then turn the car and head back north while the two on foot ducked behind the nearest line of rocks and worked south toward the red gate and holed up in the small craters ten yards from the blacktop.\\n\\n It was the two men on foot. They had night-vision devices. Nothing fancy, nothing military, just commercial equipment bought from a sporting goods catalog and carried along with everything else in the black nylon valise. They were binoculars, with some kind of electronic enhancement inside. Some kind of infrared capability. It picked up the night heat rising off the ground, and made Reacher look like he was wobbling and shimmering as he walked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/echo-burning-jack-reacher-5/page-7.html","bookId":2343,"book":{"id":2343,"title":"Echo Burning (Jack Reacher #5)","description":"Storyline: Echo Burning (Jack Reacher #5) \\n Jack Reacher returns in Lee Child\u0027s new \"rip-roaring thriller\" (\"Denver Rocky Mountain News\").
