With the manuscript was a note signed \"Vivienne Michel,\" assuring me that what she had written was purest truth and from the depths of her heart. I was much interested in this view of James Bond, through the wrong end of the telescope, so to speak, and, after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the Official Secrets Act, I have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication.
