{"id":81943,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Competent!\n Slowly, Hodgkin turned toward the hall mirror, and with his hand upon the handle of his black cane, he gazed at his reflection. Competent…\n He straightened his spine, though the effort was a bit painful, then he squared his narrow shoulders. With his free hand he reached down and carefully smoothed the front of his faded black jacket. Why, he didn\u0027t look so very old, Hodgkin decided—not a day over three-and-seventy! Lord Westmoreland certainly hadn\u0027t thought him decrepit or useless. No, indeed! Stephen David Elliott Westmoreland, the Earl of Langford, thought Albert Hodgkin would be a worthy addition to his staff! Lord Westmoreland—who possessed estates all over Europe, along with noble titles inherited through his mother and two ancestors who\u0027d named him as their heir—thought Albert Hodgkin would be a worthy addition to one of his magnificent households!\n Hodgkin tipped his head to the side, trying to imagine how he would look wearing the elegant Langford livery of green and gold, but his vision seemed to blur and waver. He lifted his hand, his long thin fingers touching, feeling at the corner of his eye, where there was an unfamiliar wetness.\n He brushed the tear away, along with the sudden, crazy impulse to wave his cane in the air and dance a little jig. Dignity, Hodgkin very strongly felt, was far more appropriate in a man who was about to join the household staff of Lord Stephen Westmoreland.\n 3\n The sun was a fiery disc sliding into the purple horizon by the time a seaman walked down the dock to the coach that had been waiting there since morning. \"There she is—the Morning Star,\" he told Stephen, who\u0027d been leaning against the door of the vehicle, idly watching a drunken brawl taking place outside a nearby pub. Before raising his arm to point out the ship, the seaman cast a cautious glance at the two coachmen, who both held pistols in clear view, and who were obviously not as indifferent as their master to the dangers lurking everywhere on the wharf. \"That\u0027s her, right there,\" he said to Stephen, indicating a small ship just gliding into port, its sails dim silhouettes in the deepening twilight. \"And she\u0027s only a bit late.\"\n Straightening, Stephen nodded to one of the coachmen, who tossed the seaman a coin for his trouble, then he walked slowly down the dock, wishing that his mother or his sister-in-law could have been here with him when Burleton\u0027s bride disembarked. The presence of concerned females might have helped soften the blow when he delivered the tragic news to the girl, news that was going to shatter her dreams.\n \"This is a nightmare!\" Sheridan Bromleigh cried at the astonished cabin boy who\u0027d come to tell her for the second time that \"a gentleman\" was waiting for her on the pier—a gentleman she naturally assumed was Lord Burleton. \"Tell him to wait. Tell him I died. No, tell him we\u0027re still indisposed.\" She shoved the door closed, shot the bolt, then pressed her back to the panel, her gaze darting to the frightened maid who was perched on the edge of the narrow cot in the cabin they\u0027d shared, twisting a handkerchief in her plump hands. \"It\u0027s a nightmare, and when I wake up in the morning, it will all be over, won\u0027t it, Meg?\"\n Meg shook her head so vigorously that it set the ribbons on her white cap bobbing. \"It\u0027s no dream. You\u0027ll have to talk to the baron and tell him something—something that won\u0027t vex him, and something he\u0027ll believe.\"\n \"Well, that certainly eliminates the truth,\" Sheridan said bitterly. \"I mean, he\u0027s bound to be just a trifle miffed if I tell him I\u0027ve managed to misplace his fiancée somewhere along the English coastline. The truth is I lost her!\"\n \"You didn\u0027t lose her, she eloped! Miss Charise ran off with Mr. Morrison when we stopped in the last port.\"\n \"Regardless of that, what matters is that she was entrusted to my care, and I failed in my duty to her father and to the baron. There\u0027s nothing to do but go out there and tell the baron that.\"\n \"You mustn\u0027t!\" Meg cried. \"He\u0027ll have us thrown straight into a dungeon! Besides, you have to make him feel kindly toward us because we have no one else to turn to, nowhere to go. Miss Charise took all the money with her, and there isn\u0027t a shilling to buy passage home.\"\n \"I\u0027ll find some sort of work.\" Despite her confident words, Sherry\u0027s voice trembled with strain, and she looked about the tiny cabin, unconsciously longing for somewhere to hide.\n \"You don\u0027t have any references,\" Meg argued, her voice filling with tears. \"And we don\u0027t have anywhere to sleep tonight and no money for lodgings. We\u0027re going to land in the gutter. Or worse!\"\n \"What could be worse?\" Sheridan said, but when Meg opened her mouth to answer, Sherry held up a hand and said with a trace of her normal humor and spirit, \"No, don\u0027t, I beg you. Don\u0027t even consider \u0027white slavery.\u0027 \"\n Meg paled and her mouth fell open, her voice dropping to a dazed whisper. \"White… slavery.\"\n \"Meg! For heaven\u0027s sake, I meant it as a… a joke. A tasteless joke.\"\n \"If you go out there and tell him the truth, they\u0027ll toss both of us straight into a dungeon.\"\n \"Why,\" Sherry burst out, closer to hysterics than she\u0027d ever been in her life, \"do you keep talking about a dungeon?\"\n \"Because there\u0027s laws here, miss, and you—we—we\u0027ve broken some. Not on purpose, of course, but they won\u0027t care. Here, they toss you into a dungeon—no questions asked, nor answers heard. Here, there\u0027s only one sort of people who matter, and they\u0027re the Quality. What if he thinks we killed her, or stole her money, or sold her, or something evil like that? It would be his word against yours, and you aren\u0027t nobody, so the law will be on his side.\"\n Sheridan tried to say something reassuring or humorous, but her physical and emotional stamina had both suffered from weeks of unabated tension and stress, compounded by a long bout of illness during the voyage, followed by Charise\u0027s disappearance two days ago. She should never have embarked on this mad scheme in the first place, she realized. She\u0027d overestimated her ability to cope with a spoiled, foolish seventeen-year-old girl, convincing herself that her common sense and practical nature, combined with her experience teaching deportment at Miss Talbot\u0027s School for Young Ladies, which Charise had attended, would enable her to deal admirably with any difficulties that arose on the trip. Charise\u0027s dour father had been so deluded by Sheridan\u0027s brisk, competent manner that, when his heart ailment suddenly prevented him from travelling to England, he\u0027d chosen Sheridan over several older, more experienced, applicants to escort his daughter to England—Sheridan, who was barely three years older than she. Of course, Charise had something to do with his decision; she\u0027d wheedled and sulked and insisted that Miss Bromleigh be the one to accompany her, until he finally conceded. Miss Bromleigh had been the one who helped her write her letters to the baron. Miss Bromleigh, she told him, wasn\u0027t like those other sour-faced companions he\u0027d interviewed; Miss Bromleigh would be amusing company. Miss Bromleigh, she warned him slyly, wouldn\u0027t let her become so homesick that she wanted to return to America and her papa, instead of marrying the baron!\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-4.html","bookId":1803,"book":{"id":1803,"title":"Until You (Westmoreland Saga #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sheridan Bromleigh had spent most of her early life as a happy vagabond with her unruly American father and his vagrant friends.

She was doubly shocked when she heard his news. Lord Burleton, a drunkard and a wastrel, had been killed the night before. At which point fate took over.
