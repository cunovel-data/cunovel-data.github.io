Nicki has already offered himself as a prospective suitor.\" Stephen flicked a quelling glance at her as he withdrew a sheet of writing paper from his desk. \"I would like Sherry to have more than one suitor from which to choose, which means she will have to be out in Society. I\u0027d also like her to have her affections set on someone by the time her memory returns, if at all possible. That will help diminish whatever grief she may feel when she learns of Burleton\u0027s death.\" DuVille\u0027s objection was next. \"That is hoping for too much in too short a time.\" Stephen overruled that with a shake of his head. \"Not in this case. She scarcely knew Burleton. He could not have become the entire center of her universe during the short time he was with her in America.\" No one could argue the logic of that, but from there on, everything concerning Sherry\u0027s actual introduction to Society went up for endless debate. Stephen listened in growing frustration as everyone suggested various pitfalls and problems, from the possible to the absurd, that might be encountered if Sherry were introduced to the ton during the Season. 24 At the end of an hour, when impatience finally drove Stephen to begin brushing aside everyone\u0027s objections to his plan, Hugh Whitticomb suddenly decided to give his professional medical opinion of it as Sherry\u0027s physician. \"I\u0027m sorry, I cannot allow it,\" he said flatly. \"Would you care to enlighten me as to your reason?\" Stephen said caustically when the physician acted as if the matter was settled and there was nothing more to be said. \"Certainly. Your contention that Society will overlook Miss Lancaster\u0027s lack of knowledge about our ways because she is American may be partially correct. However, Miss Lancaster is sensitive enough to notice immediately that she\u0027s lacking in certain social skills, and she is likely to become her harshest critic. That will add to the extreme stress she is already under, which I cannot permit to happen. The Season begins in a few days, and that\u0027s an impossibly short time for her to learn everything she\u0027d need to know to make a full-fledged debut, as intelligent as she is.\" \"Even if that weren\u0027t an obstacle,\" Whitney added, \"we still wouldn\u0027t be able to outfit her for the full Season on such short notice. It will take a great deal of pressure to influence Madame LaSalle, or any other acceptable modiste, to set to work on a wardrobe for Miss Lancaster when they\u0027re already impossibly busy working for their regular clients.\" Ignoring that problem for the moment, Stephen directed his remarks to Whitticomb. \"We can\u0027t keep her locked away from everyone. That won\u0027t help her meet potential suitors, and furthermore, people will begin to talk and wonder why we feel the need to hide her. More important, Sherry herself will begin to wonder about that, and I suspect the conclusion she\u0027ll draw is that we\u0027re ashamed of her.\" \"I hadn\u0027t considered that,\" Whitticomb admitted, looking deeply troubled by the possibility. \"I suggest we compromise,\" Stephen said, wondering why everyone else seemed bent on finding problems, instead of solutions. \"We\u0027ll keep her social appearances to a minimum. So long as one of us stays at her side whenever she attends a function, we can shield her from too many questions.\" \"You can\u0027t shield her completely,\" Whitticomb argued. \"What will you tell people about who she is and how she lost her memory?\" \"We\u0027ll tell them the truth, but without going into too much detail. We will say that she suffered an injury, and though we can all vouch for her identity, as well as for her being of unexceptional birth and character, she simply cannot answer questions for a while.\" \"You know how cruel people can be! Why, her lack of knowledge could be mistaken for stupidity.\" \"Stupidity?\" Stephen scoffed with a harsh laugh. \"How long has it been since you went to a debutante ball and tried to carry on a sensible conversation with any of the chits making their annual debut?\" Without waiting for a reply, he said, \"I can still remember the last time I didâ€”half of them were incapable of discourse on any topic beyond the latest fashion and the weather. The rest of them couldn\u0027t do anything but blush and simper. Sherry is extremely intelligent, and that will be evident to anyone with enough wit to recognize intelligence when it is right in front of them.\" \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll seem stupid to anyone,\" Whitney put in slowly. \"They\u0027re more likely to think her wonderfully mysterious, particularly the younger beaux.\" \"It\u0027s settled then,\" Stephen said with an implacable finality that warned further argument would be futile. \"Whitney, you and Mother make the arrangements to see her appropriately attired. We\u0027ll introduce her to Society under our own aegis, and then make certain that at least one of us is always with her. Let\u0027s begin by taking her to the opera, where she can be seen but not easily approached. After that, a musicale, a few teas. Her looks are so extraordinary that she\u0027s bound to attract considerable attention, and when she doesn\u0027t immediately appear at all the balls, the mystery surrounding her will grow, and as Whitney pointed out, that\u0027s actually to our advantage.\" Feeling satisfied that all the important considerations had been resolved, Stephen looked around and said, \"Does anyone have anything else that needs to be discussed?\" \"One thing,\" his mother said very emphatically. \"She cannot possibly stay under your roof with you another night. If it were known she\u0027d been in this house alone and unchaperoned, nothing we could do or say would salvage her reputation or enable her to make a suitable match. It will be a miracle if servants\u0027 gossip hasn\u0027t already spread.\" \"The servants adore her. They wouldn\u0027t utter a word to hurt her.\" \"Be that as it may, they are bound to talk with other people\u0027s servants without intending to harm her. By the time the on-dits have circulated through the city, she\u0027ll have become your paramour, and we cannot risk that sort of gossip.\" \"I suppose Clayton and I could invite her to stay with us,\" Whitney said reluctantly when Stephen seemed to be waiting for her to make the offer, but she wasn\u0027t at all pleased with the solution. She didn\u0027t want to remove Sherry from Stephen\u0027s immediate sphere. Once the round of social activities began with the crushes of people at all of them, Stephen might not encounter her for days at a stretch, or only for a few minutes at a time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-44.html","bookId":1803,"book":{"id":1803,"title":"Until You (Westmoreland Saga #3)","description":"Storyline: Sheridan Bromleigh had spent most of her early life as a happy vagabond with her unruly American father and his vagrant friends. Then, given over to the care of a strict maiden aunt, she was taught to be a lady - poor but genteel - and finally a teacher. When she was hired to act as chaperone to a pretty but spoilt heiress travelling to England to join an aristocratic fiance, Sheridan was delighted. Now, at last, she could visit her family\u0027s country. But somehow everything went wrong. For Miss Charise Lancaster, not over-gifted with intelligence, eloped with a stranger before she could meet her suitor. And Sheridan was left with the horrid task of telling Lord Burleton she had somehow misplaced his bride. As she gazed at the tall, confident man before her, her courage failed. She was doubly shocked when she heard his news. Lord Burleton, a drunkard and a wastrel, had been killed the night before. At which point fate took over. Sheridan was knocked unconscious on the quayside, and recovered to find herself in the handsome stranger\u0027s care, not knowing who she was. It was to be the beginning of a dazzling, witty, dramatic, and romantic sequence of events in which every possible confusion was to take place.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3.jpg","author":"Judith McNaught","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:12 PM"}}
