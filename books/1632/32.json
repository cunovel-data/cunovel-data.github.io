No!”\\n\\n AI TRANSLATOR: Monitor language stream resuming. It is incomplete but recoverable.\\n\\n Chapter Forty-Two\\n\\n THE DIDACT’S SHIP lifted away from the fog-shrouded wheel as it rotated above the greater Ark, that vast, life-bearing, regenerative flower floating in the dimness above the galaxy’s margins.\\n\\n No more Halos issued from its Forge.\\n\\n My flesh had been shriven. My humanity had come to an end, and yet I had become the Finger of the First Man, as Gamelpar had told the story—built to last thousands of years . . . built to serve Forerunners.\\n\\n But also made as a gift for the Librarian.\\n\\n And given the opportunity, finaly, to testify to you, the true Reclaimers.\\n\\n In time, my numbness developed into something richer, something that could survive thousands of centuries with only a minimum of madness creeping in. To contain multitudes is a definition of madness, is it not? I have rarely been able to remember which of my fragmented selves has performed any particular action.\\n\\n I see in your records that one of me caused you considerable difficulty—and then, assisted you! How like us. But never did that monitor reveal its origins, or the motives behind its perverse behaviors.\\n\\n Perhaps now you can guess.\\n\\n As Reclaimer, it is your privilege to shrive me again—not of the flesh, long since turned to dust, but of my rich confusion of sins.\\n\\n The Forerunners had, for a time, the Domain. I have never been able to access the Domain. Perhaps it no longer touches any part of our universe. If that is the case, then nobody wil ever understand the history or the motivations of the Didact or any other Forerunner.\\n\\n That means, however long I continue to exist, I wil never understand why any of this had to happen.\\n\\n I last observed the Didact in company with the Librarian on the Ark. They were walking on a high ribbon over the greatest biological preserve I had yet seen—dwarfing any such on the wheel. Thousands of kilometers of varied habitats, containing the accumulated life stores of wel over a thousand worlds—and stil, in the time remaining, she was planning to gather more.\\n\\n That was also the last time I saw Vinnevra. She had become part of the Librarian’s core population of humans, minus, of course, the representatives from Earth—from Erde-Tyrene, I mean.\\n\\n I was no longer responsible for her; she could not even recognize me. Yet ever since I have missed her.\\n\\n Riser had survived the removal of his imprint—a very tough cha manush indeed—and had been returned to our home. Or so I was told. I vowed at the first opportunity, I would look for him.\\n\\n I would do everything I could to find him.\\n\\n But the location of Erde-Tyrene was concealed from me for many years. And when I was finaly given the freedom to search, it was already too late.\\n\\n I miss him to this day.\\n\\n I miss Vinnevra, and Gamelpar, and my mother.\\n\\n I miss them al to this very instant.\\n\\n At the command of the Didact, who rarely commanded his wife about anything, those processed by the Composer, those who remained on the fog-shrouded wheel, along with the remains of al the other Flood victims and the deactivated Graveminds—of which ten had already formed—and the last of the functioning monitors keeping perpetual watch—al on the wheel and the wheel itself were sent through a portal for one last time, never to be used in that same way again.\\n\\n It was known as Instalation 07.\\n\\n It has become a sacred tomb for milions, though some may stil live.\\n\\n I do not know.\\n\\n The Librarian was very interested in my report on the conditions of Erde-Tyrene, which she had not visited for many years. To my\\n\\n Erde-Tyrene, which she had not visited for many years. To my dismay, I had to acknowledge that it was likely not her touch I had felt at birth—not her personal touch—but that of an automated imprinting system. Now that I was no longer flesh, that revelation did not disturb me. Much.\\n\\n I stil kept a firm record of how the original Chakas had felt about the Librarian.\\n\\n The Didact returned to the graces of the newly constituted Council —for a time. The Librarian’s power, of course, rose along with that of her husband.\\n\\n Know one knew of the actual fate of the Master Builder. It was assumed he had died somewhere on Instalation 07.\\n\\n The debate about strategies against the Flood was renewed. As I said, neither of the Arks were manufacturing Halos, though they were certainly capable of such. This fact, which seemed inconsequential at the time, would eventualy be hidden from me in the name of “compartmentalization.”\\n\\n I see very clearly how much the Librarian has shaped humanity since the end of the first human-Forerunner war.\\n\\n Whenever you look inward and see an ideal female . . . whether it be goddess, anima, mother, sister, or lover . . .\\n\\n For a brief, barely sensible instant, you wil see the face and feel the spirit of the Librarian.\\n\\n My systems are shutting down. The humans I carry within me are dying . . . I can feel them fading by the milions. Old friends in my solitude. So many discourses and debates on human nature and history!\\n\\n Gone.\\n\\n They were brave spirits and deserved more than ever I could give them.\\n\\n END STREAM\\n\\n TENTATIVE CONFIRMATION: PARTIAL MEMORY STORE of Forerunner AI “Monitor” 343 GUILTY SPARK\\n\\n DEVICE STATUS INACTIVE—NONRECOVERABLE.\\n\\n DEVICE ORDERED JETTISONED BY ONI COMMANDER.\\n\\n REQUEST FOR STANDARD BURIAL CEREMONY DENIED BY SAME.\\n\\n END DATA LOG.\\n\\n RESUME DATA LOG (ibid ref.)\\n\\n SCIENCE TEAM LEADER: “What’s up with the tech team?”\\n\\n ONI COMMANDER: “They’re running around on C deck like a bunch of scared marmots, carrying AI cores.

I went mad. I served my enemies. They became my only friends.\" \\n \"Since then, I\u0027ve traveled back and forth across this galaxy, and out to the spaces between galaxies--a greater reach than any human before me. \" \\n \"You have asked me to tell you about that time. Since you are the last true Reclaimer, I must obey. Are you recording? Good. Because my memory is failing rapidly. I doubt I\u0027ll be able to finish the story.\" \\n \"Once, on my birth-world, a world I knew as Erde-Tyrene, and which now is called Earth, my name was Chakas...\" \\n In the wake of apparent self-destruction of the Forerunner empire, two humans--Chakas and Riser--are like flotsam washed up on very strange shores indeed. \\n Captured by the Master Builder, misplaced during a furious battle in space, they now find themselves on an inverted world where horizons rise into the sky, and where humans of all kinds are trapped in a perilous cycle of horror and neglect. For they have become both research animals and strategic pawns in a cosmic game whose madness knows no end--a game of ancient vengeance between the powers who seeded the galaxy with life, and the Forerunners who expect to inherit their sacred Mantle of duty to all living things. \\n In the company of a young girl and an old man, Chakas begins an epic journey across a lost and damaged Halo in search of a way home, an explanation for the warrior spirits rising up within, and for the Librarian\u0027s tampering with human destiny. \\n This journey will take them into the Palace of Pain, the domain of a powerful and monstrous intelligence who claims to be the Last Precursor, and who now has control of both this Halo and the fate of Forerunners and Humans alike. \\n Called the Captive by Forerunners, and the Primordial by ancient human warriors, this intelligence has taken charge of, and retasked, the Master Builder\u0027s cruel researches into the Flood--which it may have itself unleashed on the galaxy more than ten thousand years before.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/halo-primordium-halo-9.jpg","author":"Greg Bear","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/halo-primordium-halo-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:20 PM"}}
