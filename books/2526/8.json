I don\u0027t believe it - we\u0027re history!\"\\n\\n Rider was standing on the weapons table raising a crossbow at the vacant doorway. J.L. was freaking out as cold-body alarms suddenly went off, like the hallway sprinklers did - after the fact - after Carlos had released his hold on them and cleared the building. Their lights had gone out and come back up. Shabazz and Big Mike were stomping on naming maps of Hell like madmen, Marlene was walking in a circle brandishing her stick. Dan had a Glock nine frozen between both hands as he stood near the computers with his mouth open... and the only thing Damali could do was gently wipe her lips with the back of her hand, savoring the taste of Carlos as she studied the wall. Time started slowing down.\\n\\n She closed her eyes and put her fingers in the deep grooves Carlos\u0027s nails had left. The tremors that ran through her were like waves of aftershocks she couldn\u0027t control. She didn\u0027t care. Unable to move, she glanced toward the holy water sprinkler systems spraying the hall, alarms sounding very distant, the team\u0027s voices muffled, and breathed the last trace of Carlos into her - almost following it, she could feel him pull her, and his dilemma was hers, too... she could literally smell him. Yes, like her, he was torn to shreds between that rock and a hard place decision. Not just torn, it was much worse than that, this ache. It ripped. Filleted all judgment till she had to catch her balance.\\n\\n What was everyone babbling about? If they would only shut up, she could hear him! She couldn\u0027t regulate her breaths. Her skin was on fire. Her hand covered her neck, and his moan that she\u0027d swallowed sent a new coating of heat inside her belly. He was calling her, still, if they\u0027d only shut up! He was standing across the road on the other side of the border of light, summoning the strength not to break down the door. She could feel him getting stronger. The shudder of need that ran through him quaked her even from that distance away. She closed her eyes and told him the truth - that she wanted to be with him right now more than he could ever know.\\n\\n His response was immediate. The fantasy carved images of him and her into her brain... she could feel each delicious detail as she stood very still. Something in her snapped, and rather than retreat from the forbidden pull, she transmitted full-blast everything she had always wanted with him. Didn\u0027t you know, since way back when, how many nights I nearly lost my mind? She couldn\u0027t help it, unvarnished truth spilled out silently, privately, and the echo in her mind was his burning reply. If I had known... trust me, I would have never let you go. Had I known tonight, I would have carried you past the lights to my lair. Just come to me!\\n\\n Oblivious to the chaos around her, she connected beyond the compound perimeter to mentally meet him.\\n\\n Instinct told her not to, cautioned her not to go there or open up a return response, but she found herself tilting her head, opening herself fully to him. She bit him, and nuzzled him in reply, kissed him hard, and scored him again with her nails. She felt his intense shudder through every cell of her body. He made her crave his entry with such force that her hand reached out to hold onto the wall once more. She felt the rough-texture cinder block, and in her mind she slammed him against it, kissing him harder, wanting to take more of him deeper. It\u0027s all yours, baby... just get me out of here, I\u0027m guarded.\\n\\n Just as quickly as she\u0027d hurled the thought, something powerful, razor-sharp, scored her throat - it didn\u0027t hurt, but shards of light exploded behind her lids and a tremor ripped through her body, morphing into a convulsion. Frustration imploded, sent her next response to him as a dare, a challenge with the image of her room, her in it, and what she\u0027d like him to do, then she bit him harder within the vision. All night, her thoughts whispered, till you fear me more than the sun.\\n\\n A howl in the distance fused with his moan, welding his desire to her spinal cord, tearing through her vertebrae, and leaving her breathless. In her mind she could hear her voice cry out like it had its own will, the effect of it making him take her harder - she wasn\u0027t forming words, just deep, honest, uninhibited chants of ecstasy... harmonic expression, hitting notes way outside of her range - and now he couldn\u0027t catch his breath, was begging her not to stop. She smiled, telling him the cold-blooded truth. Yeah, I hear you, baby, been needing you like this for a very long time. She\u0027d been trying to explain, but he never would listen.\\n\\n He put up his hand to the prison glass of invisible distance that separated them, and she met it, raising her palm, spreading her fingers - it left a pang that traveled. The sensation was so raw that she continued to brace herself so she wouldn\u0027t fall. With her eyes closed she could literally see him exactly where he was standing in the thicket, washed with moonlight, total energy, shoulders bare, her mark on him, sharing adrenaline, needing to hunt, needing her more, his chest expanding and contracting, breaths were now coming faster, he sensed her locking in to feel him again, to hunt him. His deep, intense eyes said it all, his expression pained like hers. There was only one answer she could give him - yes. She could dig it. They needed to stop playing with this!\\n\\n He\u0027d caught her reply like a hard blow to his jaw, and it made his head snap back. Yeah, he\u0027d heard her response loud and clear.\\n\\n What? Don\u0027t play with him?. Who was playing right now? Then his summons became a command and transformed into an urgent request as he dropped to his knees in the tall grass outside. Please come to me, come outside, I can\u0027t take it, baby. Her mind wrapped around the fervent message and stroked it as she sent it back. Watching his chest expand, taut with muscle as he battled for oxygen, sweat running down his temples, arms outstretched, the blue light of the moon making every surface of him glisten, his Adam\u0027s apple bobbing with each ragged breath that he drew, the answer became so clear. His voice was an insistent refrain for mercy, telling her what she already knew: Damali, come to me. Now! I need you.\\n\\n \"I do, too,\" she said out loud. She started for the door. Whatever her guardians said, she was leaving. She had to. \"Turn off the lights,\" she heard herself say.\\n\\n Suddenly she was shaken hard. Dazed, Damali looked around. Marlene\u0027s grip tightened. A pair of wise eyes held hers; an aging hand touched her damp face, and broke the spell. Damali leaned against the wall and breathed. The need to go after Carlos made tears well up in her eyes as she resisted his call. Her team stood momentarily frozen - she couldn\u0027t address that right now. Her goal was too singular; her focus unwavering. The voice in her head was escalating, panicking as her attention divided, telling her: Baby, don\u0027t listen to them - this is about me and you!\\n\\n The guardians would just have to back off, and deal with her decision, and let her out of there. Never in her life had her body ached for a man like this. This wasn\u0027t a democratic decision, something the group had to vote on - she was out.\\n\\n And even with Marlene standing squarely before her, she could still feel Carlos losing his mind from the same fire that burned her. Every second of lost momentum to fill his arms - she suffered.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve gotta go,\" she whispered, hoping Marlene would understand.\\n\\n \"Right now, he\u0027ll hurt you.\" Marlene blocked her and her lips began to move quietly.\\n\\n Slowly, but surely, she could hear the rest of the group speaking in panicked chaos. Only when Damali could push herself away from the wall and stand unassisted, did Marlene move away. Time immediately snapped back and picked up the pace.\\n\\n There was no way to tell if she\u0027d been locked to him for a few seconds or a half hour. Disoriented, she tried to focus her attention enough to gather conversation. But every now and then a wave of desire would ripple through her, and she would brace herself till it dulled and passed.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t even get a shot off,\" Rider hollered, his crossbow still leveled at nothing. \"If I did, I would have got both of them... Shit.\"\\n\\n \"We had a flat-out weapons room breach,\" J.L. was yelling, \"right in our own backyard! I can\u0027t believe it!\"\\n\\n \"A breach? Motherfucker, this was a full-scale invasion!\" Big Mike stomped the ashes, which had long been out, and then started beating them with a stake on the floor. \"I\u0027m gonna stab that slick bastard, Carlos - watch and see, I\u0027ma blow his ass up - bringing maps of Hell in here to our girl like he was bringing flowers - ain\u0027t that some shit, Shabazz?\"\\n\\n \"Maaaannn... I know some people that know some people that know some people - feel me - I\u0027ma have the motherfucker seen. I\u0027ma kill him up good!\"\\n\\n Dan\u0027s gun barrel jumped as he continued to point it at the wall. \"Look at the freakin\u0027 wall!\"\\n\\n The group stared at the five evenly spaced, inch-deep drags down the wall and fell silent.\\n\\n \"Big Mike, no offense, but that\u0027s a strong SOB - even you might hafta just blow his ass up. Long distance. Period. Fuck this crossbow.\" Rider jumped down off the table and shook his head. \"We\u0027re history. Been fun, gang. I\u0027m going to go get a drink.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, Rider,\" Shabazz said, making him stop. \"This is some valuable info, dude. If we have to go up against one made before Rivera, and at the top of the food chain - we just learned a lot about how this predator functions, man. Rivera rolled in on us like he was a goddamned master, brother! Rivera just got made - which means he\u0027s either a second or third generation vamp. You dig? We just learned how strong they get when a female Neteru...\" His voice trailed off and he looked away. \"We learned a lot. Need much-improved weapons. For real, for real.\"\\n\\n Silent horror mixed with a violating sense of humiliation fixed Damali\u0027s gaze to a piece of crumbled cinder block on the floor. Oh, my God... this was the new chant in her skull. Heaven help her, she almost went out there. Two seconds, and it would have been over. The guys ranted on, while she tried to become invisible. If she didn\u0027t die of the bite, then she would definitely die of shame. She closed her eyes. Please God; don\u0027t let them have seen anything that had gone through her mind. Oh my God. It was beyond personal; in fact, strike the request to the folks upstairs - even they didn\u0027t need to see that. She wrapped her arms around her waist, and pulled in small sips of air.\\n\\n \"You got a point,\" Rider muttered, oblivious that she had zoned out of whatever they were talking about. \"An inch-deep slice into cinder block, times five fingers, done with his bare hands - and waltzed right in our front door, chatted, kissed Damali, and rolled? Blocked our alarm systems, too? Oh, no. This is over the top for me, fellas. We are talking about something that could cross every barrier that we\u0027ve rigged. Thought I\u0027d seen it all.\"\\n\\n \"Deep part was,\" Shabazz said very slowly, \"he wanted her so bad you could feel the electricity in the air - it\u0027s still cracklin\u0027 in here. But he didn\u0027t bite her. That\u0027s real strange. You could see it on his face; he was trying to show respect, but lost it when she went to him. But he didn\u0027t nick her, that\u0027s the thing, or pull her out of here, when he could have. Something\u0027s up with that - we need to figure out why, especially before tomorrow night.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you hit the lights, J.L.?\" Big Mike stood and drove a stake through the table and snapped it in half, and then cast the remainder across the room.\\n\\n \"I did!\" J.L. was at the console, his fingers a blur as he checked and double-checked his failed systems. \"What the hell!\"\\n\\n Jose walked into the room and everybody started.\\n\\n \"Shine some light on dude,\" Rider said, jumping back.\\n\\n \"Yo, y\u0027all, sprinklers is going off and shit, what the - \"\\n\\n \"You missed Mardi Gras in here, Jose. It was deep.\" Rider was walking in a circle as Big Mike blasted their teammate with light and Jose covered his eyes.\\n\\n Marlene pointed at Mike\u0027s stake in the table and on the floor. \"Get that light out of Jose\u0027s face - it was the adrenaline in Rivera\u0027s bloodstream! He blew out all systems, just shut \u0027em down and walked! Why? Because he\u0027s no second generation - he\u0027s a master. He did it because he\u0027d crossed the threshold, got close to the power sources in here, and close to her. It\u0027s like having a top-of-the-line vampire in here on PCP. They flip. You fellas ain\u0027t getting\u0027 this, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Damali murmured. It was the first thing she\u0027d been able to say since the mayhem broke out.\\n\\n The room went immediately quiet.\\n\\n \"You all right, girlfriend?\" Rider asked quietly. \"Like, these lights in here ain\u0027t bothering you, or nothin\u0027, right?\"\\n\\n Damali didn\u0027t have the energy to respond to Rider\u0027s sarcasm. Instead, she wrapped her arms around herself tighter and faced the wall. The sadness in her was lodged so deep within her chest that she couldn\u0027t even cry.\\n\\n \"I felt it when he kissed me. His jaw unhinged and his incisors dropped... and I could hear him in my head... but I wasn\u0027t afraid.\" The rest of what he\u0027d made her feel, she buried deep within herself and just let her breaths continue in small sips of air.\\n\\n \"Oh, baby...\"\\n\\n She could feel Marlene\u0027s arms wrap around her, and she allowed the hug, but needed to pull away. The maternal touch just didn\u0027t mix right with the one she\u0027d just experienced, and oddly, she didn\u0027t want the first one to vanish just yet.\\n\\n \"Gentlemen, lock up the compound, repair the equipment, do make yourselves useful - but don\u0027t say a word to her right now. Please.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s turned, Mar,\" Damali whispered. \"They got him.\"\\n\\n When Rider opened his mouth to give Marlene a smart reply, her glare closed it.\\n\\n \"Not a word,\" Marlene said in a near hiss. \"Not a mumblin\u0027 word. Her heart\u0027s been injured, and it\u0027s a mortal wound. C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go talk.\"\\n\\n Thankful for the extraction and female company that would allow her to grieve, Damali numbly followed Marlene down the hall. Truthfully, she really didn\u0027t care what was up anymore. He\u0027d turned. The full monte. And she knew when it had happened. The pictures in the newspaper - it had happened in the woods.\\n\\n Marlene sat quietly beside her for a long time on the edge of her bed. She didn\u0027t touch her, or ask her questions. The two of them just sat.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know what to say to you, Mar,\" Damali murmured after a while.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to say a word. I\u0027ve been there. My lover... Raven\u0027s father. It cut to the bone when I found out, and I thought I would die. It\u0027s a soul wound that never heals.\"\\n\\n \"Why did he help us? Regardless, what he\u0027d told us was the truth, I could sense it, and so can you... that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t think he was a...\" She whispered, her voice trailed off as she looked at the window that was now covered by steel. More and more it felt like a prison, not a sanctuary any longer.\\n\\n \"Because... he loved you, once, I think. And if he\u0027d wanted to hurt you, he would have, in the hospital - if he turned when we both guess that he did. One day he will, though. We both know that.\"\\n\\n It was the last part of what Marlene said that made her cover her face with her palms and lean over so far that the backs of her hands touched her thighs. The wail of despair that came up from inside her was from somewhere so core that even rocking as she released it didn\u0027t stop it from ripping at the cloth of who she was. This man that she had prayed for, hoped for, saw the good in and knew could change... had the will and the intellect, and had fallen. And not just fallen to the things of the world, like a gun, a lock-down, no, but he\u0027d fallen so deep into the abyss that there was no bringing him back. Yet much of it was his choice.\\n\\n She\u0027d tried to tell him, a long, long time ago... when they\u0027d sat on the beach, when they\u0027d argue street politics... when he\u0027d smile and say, \"Baby, I got it all under control.\" But he never would listen, thought life was a game, and it could be played to the bone, but some shit you just didn\u0027t fuck with, the dark realm was one of those things, to name a few. Machismo, male drama, he\u0027d rolled out every day dangling by a thread between life and death or worse - half-life. Oblivious, until something deep moved on him, and then it was all over. And she\u0027d seen so many fine brothers, just like him - leaving people to wail and pray after their souls... now even that within Carlos was gone.\\n\\n Although she knew life wasn\u0027t fair, was a grown woman, a vampire huntress that they proclaimed had some invincible, powerful, unstoppable vibe within her - and could bring it, in this very private moment of personal defeat - she wished so desperately that it could be fair - just once. What if? Basic reality and life was kicking her ass. Watching a person come so close to making the right choice, and then watching them become too entrenched and afraid to step off from the old and into the new, and then watching them drift back to their old ways like it was a comfortable sweater, and watching, helpless, unable to do a thing about it all when time just decided to run out on them, felt like unparalleled defeat.\\n\\n And an old sister of her soul, the warrior queen, proud with head high, sat beside her, just rubbing her back and rocking with her, probably crying inside her own heart for those same losses like that to the world. Marlene knew. Now so did she.\\n\\n Even being a baaad-sister didn\u0027t stop this type of shit from hurting. Mar had tried to warn her. Said it wasn\u0027t a flesh wound, wasn\u0027t nuthin\u0027 to play with, couldn\u0027t be sewn up with stitches... couldn\u0027t be set in a splint - but eventually she would have to set it straight to survive, not being able to breathe from the pain. It was a rite of passage - stepping off, leaving the dead in body, mind, and spirit, and moving on. But Heaven hear her cry, this one really hurt.\\n\\n Bitter sobs wracked Damali, and Marlene petted them up through her bent spine to help her system flush itself of pain. All women knew this magic, the ancient art of healing through touch - the shamans didn\u0027t own province over it, this was female power at its best... compassion, letting hurt just run its course, till disappointment magnified to screaming wails, but it was the thing that brought back sanity after the storm.\\n\\n Every loss she\u0027d sustained purged with the tears, and now she knew why Jose was dying from the inside out. There were things worse than death, watching a loved one fall and slip away was one of them, and she cried for every mother, every father, every child, every brother, every sister, every lover, every grandmom, every spouse, every anybody who had to sit and weep and watch and witness their prayers go to hell in a handbasket.\\n\\n Crazy part was, her spirit hurt so bad that, after a while, she just stepped it out of her body, and watched her whole drama of rocking and crying from a remote place in her mind. That type of decision had to be the brain\u0027s safety valve, a thing that happened to people when their sobs got too intense, she imagined. She sat beside herself, helping Marlene, wondering when her well of tears would run dry. Because she didn\u0027t go there - had never truly allowed herself to just lose it. So what the fellas had gathered around the door, and for whatever reason, that only made the tears fall harder. Perhaps the worst part of it all was that she didn\u0027t even trust herself anymore.\\n\\n She had quietly loved this man who\u0027d been her knight in shining armor, had loved this street warrior gone rogue who\u0027d rescued her from foster care - she had loved him ... so much for so long... didn\u0027t he know that even turned, they still had a bond? She\u0027d known he\u0027d crossed over, way before the kiss - but had lied to herself, hoping. Didn\u0027t want to believe her instincts. Wasn\u0027t sure which line got crossed in his dark path, general life or something harder. There was just no denying it; she still wanted him, turned and all - regardless of what she might do. Didn\u0027t matter if she walked away, like she knew she would. There\u0027d still be the marker for him where the brand landed a long time ago. Some truth was so deep that she couldn\u0027t even say it to herself. Seeing him in the shower now made so much sense, his eyes, then eyes she didn\u0027t know - both were his, the light and the dark side of the same man - it had been a premonition.\\n\\n So she cried until she just had to lie down and sleep it off, which was better that way - at least she didn\u0027t have to keep telling herself the awful, hard truth.\\n\\n Marlene shut Damali\u0027s bedroom door, walked down the long hall, entered the weapons room where the team gathered, and glanced at Big Mike.\\n\\n Mike tilted his head to the side and nodded. \"She\u0027s not stirring, Mar. If you\u0027re not picking anything up either, we can talk.\"\\n\\n \"When are you going to tell her, Mar?\" Shabazz asked in a tense voice. \"She\u0027ll be shark bait on her birthday, and we might not be able to stop it. You just saw what happened.\"\\n\\n Jose nodded. \"I\u0027ve been trying to design something for her... something that can keep her from even being scratched. When I was knocked out at the hospital, I saw it in my head. Got the idea from the light wands.\"\\n\\n Without Jose having to tell him, Big Mike brought over Jose\u0027s sketch pad, and he flipped it to the page that held a new pencil drawing.\\n\\n \"Looks like a shark-resistant wetsuit,\" Rider chuckled.\\n\\n \"It is. Reinforced silver-threaded fabric sealed to a thin layer of Kevlar with fiberoptic threads running through it. Covers her from head to toe, but looks like it\u0027s concert worthy... shows the curves, fits like a glove, but won\u0027t let her sustain a bite or a scratch - except in the face... but she won\u0027t let them nick her face. Madame Isis covers her front, and will back the vamps up. Doesn\u0027t keep her from broken bones or internally hemorrhaging, though, should one of them really land a hard blow. If she gets bitten in the shark suit, the jaws of a vamp deliver the force of a great white. So she can still get hurt, but at least their virus won\u0027t get into her bloodstream.\"\\n\\n \"By the time her birthday rolls around,\" Marlene said quietly, \"the likelihood that she\u0027ll be killed from a bite will diminish. That\u0027s not their objective, to kill her.\"\\n\\n \"Precisely,\" Shabazz murmured. \"But, the suit is extra insurance, and is da bomb, Jose.\"\\n\\n Jose smiled and dropped his open book on the table, even that small effort appearing to have drained him.\\n\\n \"How long does the suit battery last?\" J.L. murmured, glancing at the fatigue in Jose and getting up to look at the design closer. \"This is awesome, brother.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Jose breathed in a rasp. \"Wanted to still do my part. The battery lasts about four to five minutes, but if she gets surrounded, or they take her into a dark lair, she\u0027ll leave \u0027em smoking.\"\\n\\n \"That makes me feel a little better, after what we just saw.\" Rider sighed.\\n\\n Big Mike smiled. His fingers drummed the edge of the table serving a funky beat, trying to lift spirits, and working hard to calm his own frayed nerves. \"Jose, man, we\u0027re connected. You did your thing. This is the first time in weeks I started feeling my rhythm again. Words are pouring into my head.\"\\n\\n \"Let spirit speak,\" Jose said with a weak chuckle. \"We all need a positive word after what y\u0027all told me.\"\\n\\n Big Mike grinned. \"We gonna have Damali\u0027s back, and blow that concert wide open.\"\\n\\n Mike waited for the others to nod in agreement. The group needed a confidence boost. They couldn\u0027t just go down like that, and Damali needed something to give her new energy, too. Her sobs had broken him up. He\u0027d never heard her sound so sad. As an audio sensor, he knew her crying would stay with him for weeks, maybe longer. The only thing he could do was to replace it with something else. Perhaps that\u0027s why he loved his music so much. It cleared his head, blocked things he didn\u0027t want to hear. He glanced at his team. They smiled. They understood. They were his family. He started a beat on the table again. Words came to his mind, chased away Damali\u0027s tears, and rushed past his lips.\\n\\n \"She leaves \u0027em smokin\u0027 - on fire... baby got da high beams for any desire. She\u0027s hot, burning with emotion - passion so deep, she ain\u0027t jokin\u0027... she ain\u0027t playin\u0027 - will beatcha down. Betta step off, or hit da ground... She\u0027s running wit da big dogs, stay on the porch - this ain\u0027t no game, baby\u0027s got da torch, \u0027cause - \"\\n\\n \"She leaves \u0027em smoking - so watch your back! Nighttime\u0027s coming when creatures attack. She\u0027ll drop a body, dead or alive. She works da rhythms like a nine to five.\" Rider laughed, making J.L. join in.\\n\\n \"Go, Jose, get your energy on, my brother,\" Big Mike teased.\\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t scared of nothin\u0027,\" Jose said with a smile, picking up from J.L., \"ain\u0027t worried \u0027bout a thing. Baby\u0027s locked and loaded when she steps in the ring. The wise will tell you, ya betta step off, \u0027cause - \"\\n\\n \"She leaves \u0027em smokin\u0027,\" Rider repeated. \"All day and all night. Li\u0027l sis ain\u0027t bluffin\u0027, check her stance. Fights fire wit fire, the only chance. Baby owns the high road, ain\u0027t kickin\u0027 it low - \"\\n\\n \"Will hunt cha down, so act like you know.\" Big Mike picked up the tempo and winked at Shabazz. \"I ain\u0027t lying, just ask her friends. Hunts like a panther to the very end...\"\\n\\n Satisfied that his medicine was working, Mike laughed hard. Even Dan was tapping out an offbeat rhythm, though his spastic ass couldn\u0027t rap. Everyone on the team laughed except Marlene and Shabazz as the others kept the beat, and each freestyled a verse, adding to it, releasing tension.\\n\\n \"Smoking.\" Rider jumped in again. \"Watch your back. Baby got da high beams, don\u0027t lose track.\"\\n\\n \"Smokin\u0027 - hear what I\u0027m sayin\u0027? Smokin\u0027, I ain\u0027t lying, smoking, leaves \u0027em cryin\u0027 and dyin\u0027, smokin\u0027 like a house on fire, smoking, and your only chance, betta - \"\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Marlene yelled, bringing an end to beat-box revelry. \"You guys think this is a joke?\"\\n\\n \"Naw, Mar, it\u0027s a great concert entrance song to go with her new weapon outfit. Screw it,\" Rider said with a nonchalant chuckle. \"If we gotta do this, then let\u0027s do this. You wanted new music, we\u0027re all fucked up, everybody\u0027s head is twisted, and we have to get a show right before tomorrow. But, no, we don\u0027t think this is a joke. Trust me.\"\\n\\n Jose shrugged. \"Look, we\u0027re in the business, we\u0027re all artists - need new material to come out smokin\u0027.\"\\n\\n J.L., Big Mike, and Rider looked at him and laughed, and started beating on the edge of the weapons table in percussion harmony again.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re awful quiet, brother Shabazz,\" Rider said with a sheepish grin as Marlene stormed from the room.\\n\\n \"Do you know what the significance is of the seventh trait that you guard? The last thing that will happen to our girl on her birthday?\"\\n\\n The team fell silent and gave Shabazz their attention, casting nervous glances between them. Finally Big Mike shrugged. \"She\u0027ll get stronger, the hunts more dangerous, she\u0027ll have to ward off a master who might be sniffing around her, like Carlos, getting hopeful - we\u0027re just having a little fun while there\u0027s still something to laugh about. You and Mar need to chill.\"\\n\\n \"On her birthday she becomes a vessel for both sides. Every seven years a female Neteru can either produce another vampire huntress, if made with a guardian - or her womb can sustain a vamp. Her antibodies against vampirism don\u0027t kick in until her birthday, didn\u0027t you all hear Marlene before?\"\\n\\n Shabazz finally nodded when satisfied that their expressions were suitably terror-stricken enough to produce reverence for the issue.\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Rider whispered. \"Like, man, I thought we were guarding her coming into some Zen-master-slayer state or some shit like that, I mean for real for real, so I wasn\u0027t really all that concerned, given our girl was getting stronger and shit, you understand the shit I\u0027m saying, right? Holy shit!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re babbling, Rider. And watch your mouth, like Marlene has been telling us for years.\"\\n\\n \"Fucking A, I\u0027m babbling, Shabazz. Damn.\"\\n\\n \"You think Marlene would be all freaked out just because Damali is getting stronger, and might get a rush from killing a vamp? Stronger, able to draw them out of a lair - that would be a good thing, right? Think about it. It\u0027s the vulnerability that Marlene is rightfully trippin\u0027 about.\"\\n\\n \"This is too deep.\" Jose slumped over the table, leaning on his elbows, and shook his head.\\n\\n \"Profound is a better word,\" J.L. murmured. \"Like the bullshit of legends.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still not following,\" Big Mike said, ignoring the group\u0027s dismissive glances of impatience.\\n\\n \"What the hell is not to understand, Mike?\" Rider was walking around swinging his arms wildly. \"One of them does her, and it\u0027s all over.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Mike said, shaking his head. \"Why now? At twenty-one? Talk to me, Shabazz. She\u0027s like my baby sister.\"\\n\\n \"It has to be a guardian that sires, or - \"\\n\\n \"Aw, shit, we do not need that level of complexity in the group, dude.\" Rider began circling again. \"Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man...\"\\n\\n \"Relax. She has one hundred and forty-four thousand guardians on the planet to choose from. Remember? Nobody in here needs to worry or get their hopes up - the chemistry would have already been identified by now, and he would have been led to her... and he hasn\u0027t been. Correction, he was, but that\u0027s history. His choice. Shit happens.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s cool,\" Rider said woefully. \"Okay. I can live with that. But, just for the record, anybody know who Prince Charming was?\"\\n\\n J.L. slapped the back of Rider\u0027s head. \"Listen and learn so we can do our job, man. It was supposed to be Rivera, but he chose the dark path.\"\\n\\n \"Ow, fine. But don\u0027t try to act like nobody else never thought about it.\"\\n\\n Big Mike grabbed Rider by the shoulders and sat him down hard on a stool. \"Shut. Up. Rider. And listen.\"\\n\\n \"Vampires can\u0027t breed... their seed is dead, and in the females, the wombs are dead, right? Nothing ages on or in them beyond the age of the host\u0027s death.\" J.L. rubbed his faced with both palms and then began walking. \"They make more of them through the bite. Period. I don\u0027t understand how a Neteru - \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right, except if a Neteru willingly gives vampire seed a host - that\u0027s the choice. Not whether or not we sent a hunting party to New Orleans, or to do the concert. Please!\"\\n\\n Now Shabazz was pacing. \"On her birthday, our Neteru\u0027s sensory patterns will lock in and her body is going to change again to add the seventh sense - which uses all senses, and she\u0027s going to have to fight a craving that\u0027s as bad as the vampire thirst. She\u0027ll be in here like a damned junkie. On the positive side, if a guardian gets to her, or the initial fertility season passes, then we have no issue, and we\u0027re cool for another seven years. But, if the vamps get to her, then we\u0027ve got a serious problem. There\u0027s a one-month window when her system, for lack of a better term, reboots - old antibodies flush, she\u0027s susceptible to the vampire viral infection, and it takes a month for her to be restored.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll try to turn her, right? So we just have to be on red alert during this first one-month vulnerability window?\"\\n\\n \"No, Jose. Were it just that simple. If she gets bitten and impregnated before her full tolerance is set, which is synergistic to the vampires\u0027 romantic proclivities - biting is an integral part of their passion process, all lusts are involved when they... You get my drift. She\u0027ll only have enough antibodies in her system to keep her from turning, but not anything else in her body. It takes a month from her birthday, till her next cycle - her first full cycle after her birthday, for her to be in the clear. Are you hearing me?\"\\n\\n \"Talk to us, Shabazz,\" Rider murmured. \"If there aren\u0027t enough antibodies flooding her system when it\u0027s virally infected and she conceives, the cells will first ensure the host, the Neteru, is not endangered? The antibodies won\u0027t help the fetus if there aren\u0027t enough in Damali\u0027s body to assist both, is what you\u0027re saying? Everything about the way she was created is meant to keep her fighting?\"\\n\\n Shabazz let his breath out hard. \"Yeah, Rider. Plus, if she gets into a telepathy lock with a master, she\u0027ll want him to bite her, like a dare almost, to draw him to her. It\u0027s her hunting instinct. But the possible backfire is, within the lock, she\u0027ll also be feeling his urges as strongly as if they were her own. She can transmit, and she can receive and feel him - has to in order to locate him. The right guardian will be lead to her the same way one day. That\u0027s the double-edged sword of the telepathy gift, though. A master vamp will be trembling to bite her. She\u0027ll feel that primal desire, too. But she won\u0027t have a natural fear of it, because instinctively she knows it can\u0027t hurt her - and that\u0027s her vulnerability - the fearlessness. It\u0027ll kick in all of her hunting instincts, which are a real turn-on for the male vamps. Gentlemen, consider the reality of a huntress that was genuinely afraid of a vampire bite; do you think that human entity could repeatedly go into harm\u0027s way where she could be bitten?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Big Mike murmured, his expression one of stricken awe.\\n\\n \"Right,\" Shabazz said evenly. \"And trust me, fellas, if she has that master vamp in a mind lock to be able to track him, her instinctive goal to always get to his lair to terminate him, but she will transmit her first flash of competing desires back to him - and he\u0027ll oblige. It\u0027s a dance. She lures him, he steps to her, she pulls him harder until he can\u0027t stand it and stops hiding from her. Then, it\u0027s on. Whoever is stronger, wins. Think back on those roiling emotions of your first time, huh?\"\\n\\n Big Mike walked in an agitated circle and began wringing his hands. \"Oh, brother, brother, brother. That\u0027s some powerful feelin\u0027s. You ain\u0027t scared of your momma, your daddy... will walk through fire to - \"\\n\\n \"Mike, why do you think me and Mar have been a nervous wreck? She\u0027s grown in human terms, but in Neteru physiology... Damn. Look, problem is, poor baby girl does not understand that she could host a daywalker. Her protective instincts would never allow us to drive a stake into an infant vamp when it comes into the world bearing fangs... then they\u0027ll have her. She would flee to be with them, if for no other reason than to protect it. She\u0027d hide in their lairs, they would provide her hybrid child food, amnesty, teach it their ways, and it would be daywalker royalty. And our Neteru would willingly agree, once humans attempted to eliminate it, because what mother doesn\u0027t want her child to belong to a society that accepts and protects it and gives it opportunity to thrive?\"\\n\\n \"Basic instinct,\" Jose whispered, his tense gaze fixed on Shabazz.\\n\\n \"We thought Mar just didn\u0027t want her to go to New Orleans because she\u0027d try to rush a master\u0027s lair when she was too young, before she was strong enough to hang. Didn\u0027t know they could do something like that to her.\" Mike scratched his bald head and looked away.\\n\\n \"Damn...\" Dan whispered. \"This whole experience is so freakin\u0027 deep...\"\\n\\n \"You ain\u0027t seen nothin\u0027 yet,\" Rider said, giving Dan a disgusted glance. \"She\u0027s just vulnerable for this first time out, though, right, Shabazz?\" He searched Shabazz\u0027s face for confirmation, growing more alarmed as he talked. \"I mean, after this one, then she\u0027s cool, right? Can handle herself... like Marlene said?\"\\n\\n \"My brother, Lord have mercy,\" Shabazz sighed. \"While that may be true, if they get to her on any of these ripening cycles, they\u0027d take very good care of the huntress queen in the den. She\u0027d be the only productive female in the line that could keep siring more daywalkers - because the master male vamp would risk his very existence to protect his empire builder... which means she\u0027d definitely become his woman. We\u0027d lose her from our topside family for good.\"\\n\\n \"Damn, Shabazz,\" J.L. whispered. \"Imagine, a Neteru, with mother instincts and warrior capacity, thinking she was protecting the ultimate innocent - one that she\u0027ll be telepathically connected to from the moment life sparks. Brothers, a normal human female gets superhuman strength when her young are imperiled. Women have lifted cars up to get their babies out from under a wheel. Wanna do that times ten, and go for a Neteru\u0027s child? And we just witnessed what the potential daddy can do.\"\\n\\n \"Now we are on the same page,\" Shabazz breathed out slowly. \"Worst part is, if one of us does get to that vamp progeny, assuming that we even could... her spirit would wither. She\u0027d never forgive the forces of light. She\u0027d lose hope, faith, love, and she\u0027d die.\"\\n\\n \"So, this seventh sense thing all boils down to... basic, natural... Wait. You mean to tell me that - \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even say it, Rider. Yeah. We\u0027re guarding her honor on her first time out, so to speak.\"\\n\\n Silence held the group hostage. For a moment the team just passed stricken glances between them.\\n\\n Shabazz walked away from the table. \"You saw her morph in the street, yourself, Rider. You couldn\u0027t stop her. The second-generation female vamp set it off and marked a territory - that vamp wasn\u0027t telling Damali she couldn\u0027t have Dejesus, the body in the morgue. She was talking about the head vamp, Nuit. Raven was made by that master vamp. She was a second generation, and probably Nuit\u0027s present, but sterile, queen... Raven was strong - was made by two guardians, and gave off heavy DNA-generated scent when she was abducted and then bitten. But she wasn\u0027t the real McCoy.\" Shabazz rolled his shoulders and closed his eyes.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Big Mike boomed. \"I thought you said it had to be a choice? Raven got abducted, and that wasn\u0027t a choice. Plus, she got bitten. Probably not her choice either.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll look for a Neteru before it comes of age and will try to inculcate that huntress into the vamp lifestyle, topside, by placing the poor kid within human vamp-helper reach. When it\u0027s time, by then, a Neteru will comply of his or her own free will - after years of brainwashing by darkness. But when they grabbed Raven, and sniffed her out - once they were sure she was a decoy, she was history. Marlene never really came to terms with that.\"\\n\\n \"We need to go easy on our boss lady,\" Big Mike murmured, and received a nod from Shabazz. \"She\u0027s on our side, too. Don\u0027t get it twisted. All this is deep, y\u0027all. I don\u0027t know how Marlene dealt with it.\"\\n\\n Shabazz nodded. \"Right about now, since the ranks seem to be closing in, Nuit can probably pick up Damali\u0027s scent, or has a conduit to pick up her trail - that\u0027s why Mar was guarding so hard lately. She had reason. And now we know which new second-level vamp he\u0027ll use as a conduit.\"\\n\\n Rider and Jose looked at each other. J.L. whistled and then sighed. Mike just shook his head. Dan\u0027s shoulders slumped. They all spoke as one. \"Carlos.\"\\n\\n \"No wonder baby girl was crying so bad...\" Again, Mike just shook his head. \"Damn. She loved that fool, anybody could tell. Even I prayed he\u0027d get his shit together, straighten up his act and fly right. Now, can\u0027t nobody cure them blues. Her hope just died. She\u0027s gotta ride this one out by herself.\"\\n\\n Rider blew out a long breath of frustration. \"Been there. Wished she didn\u0027t have to ever visit living Hell. Ain\u0027t love grand.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where Mar was coming from,\" Shabazz murmured.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s stay on the point,\" Rider said with a weary tone. \"We\u0027ll know when the exact ripening hits, right? Twenty-four hours of a birthday window is a lot of hours where anything could happen.\" Rider\u0027s gaze tore between the members of the group and finally settled on Shabazz. \"I mean, after all, the team trackers... We should be able to - \"\\n\\n \"No, unless you\u0027re her \u0027destined pair\u0027 guardian, even you guys with the noses won\u0027t be able to pick it up when the exact ripening starts.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Rider finally said. \"Then, what happens if we just hook li\u0027l sis up on a blind date, with a regular guy - one that we all approve of, one that she likes... and then go from there? Huh? That sounds like a plan.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t make it through the night.\"\\n\\n \"What? She\u0027d rip his throat out or something?\"\\n\\n Rider looked at Shabazz, his eyes wide, but the others had the same expressions on their faces as well.\\n\\n \"No. The male master vamp would. He\u0027ll hunt for her till he finds her, and will fight to the death to claim her. Even if her first season passes, he will look for her until she\u0027s no longer reproductive. He\u0027s got a one-month window every seven years. She\u0027s twenty-one, that means we keep vigil for at least another twenty-five years.\"\\n\\n \"Twenty-five years?\" Rider was walking again, shaking his head and mumbling to himself.\\n\\n \"Jesus,\" Big Mike whispered on a long breath. \"What about her having other normal kids and - \"\\n\\n \"She can have them, if she picks a regular guy... But the vamp that desires her\u0027ll perpetually hunt her - and the worst part is, he won\u0027t stop till he finds her. That\u0027s why we have to put this sucker down, permanently, so the girl can have a life.\"\\n\\n Shabazz walked around his teammates, becoming frustrated at their lack of comprehension. \"Don\u0027t you guys get it? Don\u0027t you read? Don\u0027t you know that the female being was always sacred? A strong woman, Neteru or not, can birth leaders of nations! She can be poor, of the humblest means, but her energy, her beliefs, her prayers, her values - what she teaches those that come from her can change history. The dark side is breaking our backs up here, compromising the strength of so many possible vessels of change!\"\\n\\n Shabazz held out his hands to the group, his words becoming more impassioned as he spoke. He walked in a circle, his arms sweeping now, as he tried to impart what he\u0027d learned, what he\u0027d witnessed.\\n\\n \"Gentlemen... from the great queens of the Nubian Empire - from Eve herself... she was made as the second prototype, after man, when the Heavens perfected the model. The human female was smarter, had more of the gifts from On High of mercy, compassion, understanding, love, trust, healing... wasn\u0027t warlike, and could produce life.\"\\n\\n He opened up his arms and let his head fall back. \"That\u0027s why she graced temples and was called a goddess - and then when evil had compromised enough men and gained a foothold, they erased her from the scriptures, from temple walls, and made her a second-class citizen - a breeder. That was not the divine design. But unprotected, no longer cherished, stripped of resources, the earth gift called woman becomes vulnerable - as do her children. More women and children reside in this poverty as the darkness hunts generation-by-generation, nation-by-nation, to find a weak vessel. They\u0027ve been looking for a female Neteru for thousands of years.\"\\n\\n Big Mike stood wide-legged, taking a battle stance. \"The dark side knows this, the light weeps because of the abuse, and a woman\u0027s womb holds the possibility of nations, like our brother said - this is a serious matter. Shabazz, you are telling this group that for the first time in three millennia, since you and I did Kemet together, like Marlene\u0027s past life visions told us, we have a female Neteru to protect, and she could go down by a male vamp? Never. Not on my watch!\"\\n\\n \"So, now, we\u0027re battling some horny Drac - \"\\n\\n \"No, Rider!\" Shabazz cut in, disgusted. \"It\u0027s not just that. Damali is the first Neteru born that crosses two millennia since they made them. She\u0027s the strongest one the light has ever crafted! In the past, only a few females were made, because they posed such a risk - but after eons of the male vampire hunters being unable to protect a normal human female carrying a Neteru heir, and with this era being so in need of one, they cast Damali as the millennium bridge. The Covenant came to Marlene and gave her the word, that\u0027s how we located the girl after she was lost in the system for a while. We are to form a ring of protection: Damali in the middle, our core, then us, then the Covenant guards our back, the warrior angels guard theirs. This is serious, man!\"\\n\\n \"Shabazz,\" Big Mike murmured, \"she\u0027s young enough to have an heir every seven years, if I\u0027m hearing you right, and that means four to five possible Neterus in her lifetime, flooding the new millennium.\"\\n\\n Shabazz nodded and looked away, breathing hard. \"For the Armageddon, brother. Damali, plus five, and the ultimate One who will come again from On High as a lion not a lamb - is six warriors of light, plus the Son, the Seventh, and ultimate warrior to lead during the twenty-first century.\"\\n\\n \"And, if she\u0027s compromised,\" J.L. whispered, \"it can be six on the wrong side of the war, plus their top gun, who will remain nameless in this compound.\"\\n\\n \"I understand now why Marlene wants her to be able to discern who to be with, man. She\u0027s got five windows of vulnerability. Plus, she can\u0027t lose her confidence her first time out in this huntress transition, \u0027cause we might not always be here, or there may be a time when our guard post is breached like it was tonight, and she has to know how to pick up a false reading on her own.\" Jose blew out a long, weary whistle. \"Marlene must be spazzing out.\"\\n\\n \"Daywalkers, Shabazz... what exactly can those things do, man? All joking aside,\" Rider whispered. \"What are we up against if our girl makes the wrong choice?\"\\n\\n \"Neteru crossed with vampire makes a daywalker. Topside chaos. All the dark powers of vampires, and all the evil, able to live on anything we eat, their preference for blood notwithstanding - with no daylight shield to protect us. Plus, we just learned that Nuit\u0027s line, the ones seeking Damali, are hybrid - mixed with revenge demons. I can\u0027t even fathom what that combo unleashed up here will do, brother.\"\\n\\n \"Shit...\" Rider spit on the cement floor again, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and sat with a thud.\\n\\n \"Damn, man, we told you - give that nasty habit a rest.\" Jose pushed himself up and began looking at the table, rubbing his chin. \"Daywalkers. If a brother and a sister were made, and connected... ?\"\\n\\n \"A brother and sister? You have got to be kidding me! That\u0027s, that\u0027s eeeiiilll - yuck! God, we\u0027ve gotta drive a few stakes very soon, fellas, \u0027cause the mating habits of vamps know no bounds!\" Rider was on his feet again, and this time Big Mike didn\u0027t shove him to sit down.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the deal,\" Shabazz sighed.\\n\\n \"Why do you think there were rumors about this being done in some of the lines within the old human dynasties? Hell, it happened in some of the Indian empires, and amongst the Incas, Mayans... the Romans and Egyptians, Europeans, Chinese - name an empire,\" J.L. said in a weary tone. \"They all wanted to keep the bloodlines intact, in the family. Cousins, siblings - it was all about maintaining absolute power... topsiders trying to break this Rubik\u0027s Cube of DNA code, and a lot of the rulers from the vampire-human traitor ranks, empire leaders, have been trying to break this code since the dawn of time for the vamps. They were close to it, but didn\u0027t have both Neteru or guardian halves.\"\\n\\n \"Fucking genetic engineering the old-fashioned way.\" Rider sat again on his own accord and just simply shook his head.\\n\\n \"If it goes down, it\u0027ll be the beginning of the end of life as we know it,\" Shabazz whispered. \"The daywalkers have eternal life, can reproduce indefinitely, as well as bite and transform a normal vamp to give it a viral immunity to sunlight... they can essentially bring all their nations topside, and the reigning sibling king and queen would be at the very top of the food chain, but still beholden to their father - the master vamp in their bloodline. Power unlimited. That\u0027s what Nuit is after, and he\u0027s about to open the gates of Hell on Damali\u0027s birthday, on five continents. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve already found our Neteru, dude,\" J.L. said, his words stilling the group. \"Probably figured out who she was when Raven saw Damali, in state, and - \"\\n\\n \"Another reason why Marlene didn\u0027t want Damali out in the street battling so close to the time. What I can\u0027t figure out is why this compound isn\u0027t under siege as we speak? Rivera already got close and confirmed any hunch the vamps might have had.\"\\n\\n \"While we\u0027ve got good security, J.L. - thanks to you, now we\u0027re sitting ducks. Before we were safe, because not even the phone company had an address, everything routed to the bogus location, and then switched here. We had the P.O. box; we drove in a different way each time. We\u0027ve never sustained a breach. But they came right through our door. My question is, what, aside from UV light and our lockdown at the moment, is keeping them from trying to get in again?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lose faith,\" Big Mike warned, his focus on Shabazz. \"Beyond all technology stuff, that\u0027s our secret weapon. Faith. That\u0027s the first and last ring of defense - prayers.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the alpha and the omega, buddy,\" Rider agreed, picking at the edge of the table as he spoke.\\n\\n \"You know, now that I think about it, it wouldn\u0027t have been to Raven\u0027s advantage to unseat her own reign,\" Shabazz said, trying to calm himself and restore confidence to the team. \"The planetary alignment told the vamps, just like us, that a Neteru is on the earth, and that her time is near - but the planets never say where. Not to mention, we have every holy order in vigilant watch prepared for battle, knowing the time is near. Something went down. If Damali is so valuable, Raven wouldn\u0027t have tried to off her. Nuit wouldn\u0027t tolerate that. And, Rivera showed up in here and didn\u0027t attempt an abduction. Hmmm...\"\\n\\n \"Problem is that at present, a lot of energy from the side of light is getting squandered while we duke it out topside with general-purpose chaos, instead of doing what the vamps just did - coming together and doing this thing united.\" J.L. raked his fingers through his hair and looked out the window.\\n\\n \"I know, J.L. We\u0027re losing good warriors daily who have been manipulated and compromised by the politics.\" The reality made Big Mike search out a stool and sit down heavily. \"Doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n \"True dat,\" Shabazz said in a far-off tone. \"The head vamp has been searching for her in the chaos which covers his tracks, and the trail to find our hidden Neteru had to have led him to the one guardian, gone bad, that could have gotten close enough to her... that guardian would be in her head, she in his head... the chemicals connect at the soul level. I don\u0027t think that thing between them has ever been broken, plus, he\u0027s a born tracker, courageous fighter, master strategist.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me,\" Rider sighed. \"Carlos was definitely her destined-pair guardian? For real?\" Rider shook his head. \"Now I\u0027m done. Just stick a fork in me.\"\\n\\n Shabazz\u0027s voice became very, very quiet and he put his head down on the table as he finished his thought. \"Until we all just sat here and talked it out, I just didn\u0027t want to deal with it. That\u0027s the link. Raven just got in the way for the second time. But there\u0027s a sure-fire vulnerability that our Neteru has, beyond all these other transitional issues, and they found it.\"\\n\\n The team glanced around and only Jose was brave enough to say what they all had known for a long time.\\n\\n \"Carlos.\"\\n\\n Shabazz nodded. \"He took the fallout, and the poor bastard didn\u0027t even know it. Just like in our camp, they turned vamps all around him to keep an eye on him - so close to Damali\u0027s time. The vamps wouldn\u0027t even trust human helpers to stay with him and on the Neteru\u0027s trail. It was too important. That\u0027s why they\u0027ve come for our folks, too. They knew he was the one - because Carlos spotted her years ago, and had the instinct to protect her... even he didn\u0027t comprehend why she was so important to him. If she\u0027d gone with Rivera and entered the drug life, she would have been so susceptible to the forces of darkness, and they thought they had her - then we got her away from him, and therefore away from them... but the link, oh, fellow guardian brothers... damn it all... the link between them was never severed.\" Shabazz swallowed hard with his eyes closed, and he breathed through his nose with his head still down.\\n\\n \"Carlos still has the Neteru scent from when Damali first mildly cycled seven years ago - he didn\u0027t even know it. He never touched her, because she said no.\" Shabazz sat up, glanced at the door, and flexed his fists. \"I would have felt it if he did. But he had the scent - tracker, par excellent. Makes sense. He came from good people, was surrounded by prayers, women of faith, made a good warrior from the streets, but he walked from the light into the dark for power, money, material gain, and got marked. The dark simply picked up on her scent from him - \u0027cause she\u0027s in Rivera\u0027s head, man, like a life raft - and she instinctively knows she is, and won\u0027t let him drown - they\u0027re linked in spirit, even though she wouldn\u0027t go along with his program then, and I pray she won\u0027t now. But they\u0027ve been in a spiritual tug-of-war to pull each other to their respective sides, paths, for years. What else can I say?\"\\n\\n \"Deep,\" Rider murmured. \"You can feel shit like that, brother?\"\\n\\n Shabazz dismissed him with a hard glance and spoke to the rest of the team, straightening himself up and giving Rider his back.\\n\\n \"Free choice, their paths were being separated by choice, then. She went light, he went dark... and with every negative transaction, Rivera came closer to the lower-realm provinces. She was still a kid, and didn\u0027t have the trinity number on her - twenty-one - so her trail wasn\u0027t as strong. That original scent held by someone sliding deeper into the negative side of the choice gray zone brought them to him,\" Shabazz whispered, \"and Rivera is the only one that can deliver her to them. She trusts him. We saw that tonight. He could get her to relent... they need his head to get inside of her head. You dig? Now drop it. This upsets me too much, and I can\u0027t talk about it anymore, like Mar can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"We gotta talk about this, Shabazz,\" Big Mike said patiently. \"The fellas need to know the deal.\" He looked at the team. \"Why do you think Marlene is always on us to guard our words? Words are formed by thoughts; when spoken, they vibrate and cause tone, tone sends vibrations to the realms. I\u0027m an audio guy, I know. Words are a manifestation of thoughts - you must think it, before you can do it or speak it, hence Damali\u0027s gift. The spoken word. Thought is energy. Energy, like electricity, travels, astral travels, is airborne - and J.L., you ain\u0027t got enough security to lock that down.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why Rivera being in her head is so dangerous. He\u0027s a thought.\" Shabazz pushed himself up from the table and yet spoke quietly toward it, looking at no one. \"The Prince of Darkness is prince of the airwaves, and all his legions down below can mess with thought. That\u0027s why one\u0027s mind is the beginning or end of all things, must be guarded - can\u0027t let any and everything assail the psyche. Everything is corrupted at the thought level first. That\u0027s what the dark side enters first to break a spirit - it\u0027s the mind, then that directs the body, and the spirit is history. Get it. Dig it. Never forget it. They are coming for our Neteru\u0027s head to get to her body and spirit. Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit... if they\u0027ve picked up some of my thoughts over the past few months - might as well hook up a black box to my skull and call it adult cable.\" Rider wiped his palms over his face. \"I liked it when I was drunk, and foolish, and an irresponsibly free man. This is for the birds. This is living on the edge - not what I was doing before.\"\\n\\n Jose chuckled. \"You can always go back and do it alone, fighting lower-realm demons solo, dude. Remember Arizona?\"\\n\\n \"Jose - \"\\n\\n Mike stood, walked to the door, and listened hard, which stilled the argument brewing between Jose and Rider. \"Wrap it up, fellas.\"\\n\\n \"But wait, Mike,\" Dan protested, his eyes still wide since the time he\u0027d been stalked by Raven. \"Carlos guarded me! You guys said he was supposed to be guardian material, but made a choice. If he was bad, then - \"\\n\\n \"Damali\u0027s link, before he turned vampire, was to what good was still left inside him. All of us have a light side and a dark side, that\u0027s the yin and yang principle, the ancient ones knew. So, even though she stepped away from Rivera and his drug life, a part of her always wondered, what if the light can prevail. That\u0027s not just the way of a Neteru - that\u0027s the way of a woman. Period. That\u0027s what gives women strength to raise children, the divine aspect of forgiveness.\"\\n\\n When no one spoke, Shabazz gave Dan a piercing look. It was not one of contempt, but one that was sent to convey the seriousness of what he was telling Dan.\\n\\n \" \u0027Cause I did time,\" Shabazz murmured. \"I watched a lot of sisters keep coming to the glass for brothers who were put away for a long sentence, or for terrible things... and I could feel them all hoping for the same outcome - \u0027what if he changed.\u0027 It was the saddest thing in the world to witness... even sadder was, if those men dug deep, they actually could have changed. Dark claimed them first, though. That\u0027s the margin of error - you just never know what free human will is gonna do. Even the angels don\u0027t know. Made me philosophical.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t we just keep her here until this situation passes?\"\\n\\n \"No! Then it\u0027s not a choice, it\u0027s just circumstance, logistics - her soul has to decide. She has to let the choice wash over her, feel the intensity of a dark pull and know that she is in full control of her impulses, or she\u0027ll forever second-guess herself. That moment of hesitation in battle, or when faced with a vampire seduction or second-guessing when in a demon zone, could cost Damali her life. I\u0027m done with this subject!\"\\n\\n \"Wrap it up, gentlemen. Mar is on the move and about to come into the hall.\"\\n\\n Shabazz held up his hand to Rider, Jose, J.L., and Dan who still had more questions as Big Mike motioned for them to quickly drop the subject, backing up Shabazz\u0027s earlier request. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-awakening-vampire-huntress-legend-2/page-8.html","bookId":2526,"book":{"id":2526,"title":"The Awakening (Vampire Huntress Legend #2)","description":"Storyline: The Awakening (Vampire Huntress Legend #2) \\n A battle is brewing in the underworld, and at the center of it all is Damali Richards, spoken word artist and vampire huntress.
