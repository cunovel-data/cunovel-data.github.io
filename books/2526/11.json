{"id":109439,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"CHAPTER TEN\n \"Body count? Ammo? Who\u0027s wounded? Status, now!\" Shabazz hollered as the besieged guardian teams huddled and re-marshaled forces.\n \"We lost four men,\" the Templar yelled, heaving in breaths. \"We\u0027re down to eight, and we\u0027ve got a man bitten and dying slow.\"\n \"Ammo is almost out,\" Rider shouted. \"From this point on, it could be hand-to-hand and we\u0027re only halfway there - judging by the reconstructed maps!\"\n The teams surrounded the Hindu monk that had been among the knight\u0027s team. The large Moor had him in his arms and the Moor was breathing hard from the exertion of the run and the battles, like the rest of them. With his eyes, the Templar asked the question, and the Moor shook his head no in silent reply.\n \"Vampire. If it was a demon strike, we could bring him up and exorcise him. But...\"\n The monk hissed as the Moor gently put him on the ground.\n \"With honor, my friend,\" the Moor said, his normal voice coming out with a struggle.\n Blood ran from the corner of the monk\u0027s mouth, and when he turned his head, a huge section of his shoulder was gone. The Moor stood back, and the guardians watched in horror while the blue-clad knight raised a silver battle-ax over his head.\n \"Go with God, and rest in peace - and in honor.\"\n The blade came down, and all gathered turned their faces as the dying man\u0027s head rolled past them on the dank cavern floor.\n \"It is the only way to assure that any of us will rest in peace,\" the knight said in a strong voice as he looked behind them. \"We knew this going in, and have dedicated our whole lives to this. We have no way to tell which line the beasts come from. Do not let any man or woman with us suffer. Do this, if we are compromised.\"\n \"We need to get to Damali. Mar, can you see anything down here?\"\n Marlene shook her head in answer to Big Mike\u0027s question. \"We\u0027re in too deep.\"\n \"We need to move,\" Rider said quietly. \"Jose doesn\u0027t look good.\"\n \"If he falls, I\u0027ll carry him... he ain\u0027t heavy - he\u0027s my brother.\" Big Mike slung his arm around Jose\u0027s shoulder as Jose struggled for air.\n \"I\u0027m slowing you all down...\"\n \"Shut up, Jose,\" Dan yelled. \"We don\u0027t leave anybody down here to perish. We go back for our own, and bury them ourselves. Come on, I got his other side, Mike.\"\n \"While we were topside, did you give Damali that extra battery, J.L.?\" Shabazz lit a concert torch as the one he was holding began to die.\n \"Yeah. If she can get to it fast enough, she might have a prayer.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hustle, folks. I hear movement again behind us,\" Rider urged. \"The monk\u0027s blood and our body heat is drawing \u0027em out again.\"\n Marlene touched the knight\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027m. sorry... but I have to say this. If they stop and feed, it gives us time. When we go topside, you tell them that your brother guardian gave his life so we may live.\"\n The knight just nodded and swallowed hard as the group began to jog deeper into the pit.\n The force of Carlos\u0027s push had landed her against a pile of gore with a soft thud, but she hadn\u0027t lost her blades. She instantly shrank away from the dead women who had cushioned her fall. The doors had flung open, and something worse, much worse than Carlos, was standing between the marble slabs now hanging from broken hinges, and it issued a threatening growl. Red, gleaming eyes peered at her through slits, as Carlos\u0027s golden ones glistened with challenge. Oh, shit...\n The thing standing in the doorway was a head taller than Carlos, and it not only had fangs but claws to match. They squared off and circled one another. While the two vampires focused on each other, she scrambled low, undetected for a moment, into the larger space behind them. The room she had sneaked into was lit with wall torches, and had more space for her to maneuver within. The massive black granite slab in the middle of the floor was something that she could use to shield herself with, and she knew she could leverage her position to fight around it when the time came.\n \"My delivery is five minutes late!\"\n \"We were attacked in the tunnels - four of my men went down.\"\n She watched as the first creature withdrew with caution, and could only assume that it was Nuit. He let out a guttural roar, which drew the same sound from Carlos. But they had stopped circling.\n \"Unfortunate, but I left your dinner at the door as promised - now leave me my bride.\"\n A bride... and Carlos asked for bodies to be left? She saw him glance at her, and the implicit threat in his eyes chilled her. Two masters in such close proximity were screwing up her telepathy. But she caught part of Carlos\u0027s response. Play the game. Right.\n \"Don\u0027t sweat me about the minor time lapse! She called you.\"\n Carlos rumbled. \"That should tell you something, despite my condition. You know the high-speed access portal has taken its toll - and as the courier, I was required to do battle, and then had to suffer holding her! Can you blame me?\"\n Damali was behind Nuit and could see his muscle-distorted shoulders begin to relax. She knew Carlos\u0027s style well enough to sense something was going on, and she locked in on his gaze. But she was too far from the menacing thing in front of her to wield the Isis, or effectively use the dagger. They would have to do this as a team, and Carlos was backing up Nuit in his lair.\n \"No, I guess this was to be expected,\" Nuit finally growled, stalking from the entrance to turn his attention on Damali. \"You\u0027ve done well,\" he said as she continued to back up, her glance going between Nuit and Carlos as she moved with Nuit, her sword cocked and ready to swing. \"The package is wrapped in silver,\" he snarled. \"Unwrap it.\"\n \"Are you insane?\" Carlos said, shaking his head. \"I held it, nearly caught fire. If I unwrap her, she\u0027s mine.\"\n \"You were to bring her to me without her barriers!\"\n \"I lost my brother, my cousin, and two of my best friends to make this delivery - and fought in the tunnels... and didn\u0027t violate the package. We need to have a discussion about the territories, and my new, expanded cut. Then, maybe I\u0027ll unwrap her for you.\"\n Damali glanced at Nuit as he tilted his head to one side, his gaze going between her and Carlos. Anxiety swept through her, as did hope. All she could do was pray that Carlos hadn\u0027t totally gone over to the other side, and that he wouldn\u0027t have turned her over for mere territory - and what did that mean, anyway? Territory? For what? She was afraid to fathom the definition as she thought of the dead women on the ground outside. But the thought of a prayer brought Nuit\u0027s attention back to her.\n \"Not down here,\" Nuit said in an even tone through his teeth.\n Carlos cast a warning glance at her.\n \"You\u0027re frightening her,\" Carlos said carefully.\n \"Good - it just intensifies the lure.\"\n \"You want her to submit willingly, or the seed might not take. Be smart.\"\n Outright indignation accosted her, and she stepped toward the beast. \"Seed? You must be on drugs.\" She would ice this sucker.\n \"I am, sweetheart. Totally blitzed by you. But you are mine.\"\n Damali glared at Nuit. Oh yeah, she would cut his heart out. \"Who I choose is my decision, asshole! And I haven\u0027t made up my mind! But it\u0027s safe to say, if you\u0027re one of my choices - not.\"\n Nuit stepped back from her for a moment, and then laughed. He inhaled, and closed his eyes briefly and began circling her. \"Carlos... you were right. She\u0027s fabulous. Absolutely intoxicating. The defiant rage in her is like a power hit.\"\n From the corner of her eye she noticed Carlos had slipped into the chamber behind Nuit. She knew she needed to hold Nuit\u0027s attention to give the other stalking vampire the advantage - then they could cancel each other out. But, again, as soon as the thought crossed her mind Carlos stopped, looked at her, stunned, and Nuit had spun around to see Carlos well inside his lair.\n \"We\u0027ll discuss your territory later. I told you, for this delivery the bride price would be high and well worth it!\"\n Carlos nodded and backed away. Mortified, she leveled her blade to defend herself from both of them. But she needed to even the score with Nuit first.\n \"Nuit! You killed my father and my mother! Took out several of my guardians, made Raven. We have a debt to settle!\"\n Unharnessed fury coiled within her and she could feel it nearly curdle her blood. But the effect of her increasing anger seemed to only strengthen the thing in front of her, as well as Carlos. Suddenly Nuit reached out, and as she swung her blade, Isis ringing, he drew back his hand and licked the ooze coming from the slash.\n \"Carlos, close the doors on your way out. You can have all of South America, Africa, whatever... she\u0027s amazing.\"\n \"I will cut your fucking balls off,\" Damali said evenly, flexing her wrist that held the dagger.\n A shudder ran through Nuit, and his eyes glowed a deeper shade of crimson. \"Close the doors, now, Rivera - she\u0027s blowing my mind.\"\n She heard a low growl coming from beyond Nuit\u0027s shoulder, and she knew he would turn to address it. The moment he did, she swung the long sword, and rolled over the slab to keep it between her and Nuit. He threw his head back and roared at the slash that had slit his suit and drew black blood. But it gave Carlos time to spring from his crouched position by the doors.\n In an instant the two entities were in the midst of a death struggle. Carlos had opened a huge second gash in Nuit\u0027s back, and when they fell, Carlos had scored Nuit\u0027s face with a swipe on the way down. But the returned swipe from Nuit had gashed Carlos the length of his abdomen, beginning at the center of his chest. Immediately the two beasts parted, circled, and then lunged at each other again, taking out a corner of the granite slab and a section of rock wall when they hurled against it.\n They were moving too fast for her to get between them to get a decisive strike in to cripple Nuit. She couldn\u0027t understand it; the Isis wasn\u0027t drawing smoke. It was cutting like a regular blade. It seemed like both of them were now impervious to the normal Isis-delivered wounds that rendered vampires impotent - but the more she fought, the more she tried to claim her part of the battle, it seemed to heighten their blood lust to destroy each other.\n Rock and marble fixtures along with torches went crashing, as teeth locked upon sections of bone that wouldn\u0027t give way. She could also feel herself getting stronger, and was soon able to keep pace with them and get out of the way, as she jockeyed for position to get in lightning-quick strikes, slashing Nuit\u0027s back, which made him round on her. She threw her dagger, and he caught it before it opened his chest.\n \"Stay out of it so you don\u0027t get hurt! You are too important!\"\n Nuit yelled at her, casting away the dagger, and pushing her so hard that her body slammed against a jagged wall.\n The silver suit ripped. Blood oozed from Damali\u0027s elbow and shoulder where it had connected against stone, and Carlos\u0027s eyes went from gold to red as he hurled a punch.\n \"Motherfucker, I will kill you!\" Carlos roared. \"Don\u0027t you ever touch her!\" He\u0027d grabbed Nuit by what remained of his suit at the chest, raised him overhead, and slammed him to the floor.\n Nuit scrambled quickly, nursing the blow that he seemed to now feel, finding a neutral corner as his eyes went from red to gold. \"You\u0027re a master? What the fuck... When did that happen?\"\n \"Shit happens, and I made a deal - several, in fact,\" Carlos breathed out, sucking in huge breaths. \"You made her bleed. You did my squad, so I had to watch my back.\" He inhaled again deeply and cast off Nuit\u0027s ring. \"She\u0027s mine.\"\n \"The Vampire Council?\" Nuit\u0027s eyes began to normalize, only flickered gold intermittently.\n \"Yeah,\" Carlos snarled. \"And I\u0027m coming for you to pull a bone out of your ass.\"\n He was on Nuit so fast that when they fell, Damali almost lost her sword. Nuit\u0027s leg was exposed, and she raised the long blade above her head and came down vertically, pinning Nuit\u0027s leg. The trapped beast let out a howl and Carlos looked over his shoulder.\n \"Back off,\" Carlos roared, \"My kill. Check the doors - company.\"\n She pulled her blade out of Nuit\u0027s leg, who was scrambling to get away from Carlos. Damali rushed to cover the open entrance as fluttering sounds came from just beyond it. But Nuit\u0027s attempt to evade another blow from Carlos was in vain. Carlos had grabbed the back of his suit and flung him across the room. Nuit\u0027s body slammed the rock, and when he looked up, dazed, Carlos bitch-slapped him with the back of his hand.\n \"Remember Alejandro!\" Carlos bellowed, taking out the bottom section of Nuit\u0027s jaw with one powerful swipe. \"You\u0027re neutered, bitch. Fair exchange is no robbery.\"\n Gurgling in agony, Nuit covered his face with both arms as Carlos\u0027s foot found the center of Nuit\u0027s chest. Like a cobra\u0027s strike, Carlos tore away one of Nuit\u0027s arms, bones snapping, as the forearm bent backward unnaturally. Damali stood transfixed. In a blur of fury Carlos\u0027s hand immediately went to Nuit\u0027s throat, the other inside Nuit\u0027s mouth, and came away with tissue and incisors. Carlos stepped back, spit on the ground, and showed Nuit what remained of his vampire powers, then his fist slowly closed over the dripping teeth and meat.\n A piteous scream came up from Nuit\u0027s gaping face. The flutter at the broken doors stopped and a cloud of bats dispersed and shape-shifted into six guards. But when they landed, and saw Nuit with Carlos growling over him, they hesitated.\n \"You were made from whose line?\" one of the entities beyond the door shouted.\n \"I was made by Nuit,\" Carlos stood, breathing hard, as Nuit slithered into a corner to take cover, then he dropped Nuit\u0027s teeth and threw the bottom half of Nuit\u0027s jaw to them for inspection.\n They sniffed the air, and sniffed Carlos from a distance, and then nodded.\n \"That\u0027s fucked-up, man. You\u0027re a second, and did him like that - with Neteru running through him?\" One of the assembled hit squad snarled a smile in Damali\u0027s direction and licked his lips.\n \"Don\u0027t even think about it,\" she whispered, her blade leveled in their direction.\n \"Wait till the boys hear this shit,\" another of the creatures beyond the door said with a chuckle. \"Humph.\"\n \"We report to you, now, or what? You taking his New Orleans lair? This bitch, Nuit, ain\u0027t good for nothin\u0027 now, dude. Damn.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t decided yet,\" Carlos said slowly, and very cautiously.\n \"Need to let my bride finish Nuit off.\" He nodded at Damali. \"Only reason I saved you some is \u0027cause you asked me to. You wanted his heart - cut it out.\"\n \"Damn, dat\u0027s cold,\" one of the vamps at the doors said, shaking his head and laughing. \"Aw, man... this territory hit is going down in history, boss. Look at this shit; let a Neteru do him in his own lair as her first birthday present. Brother, what\u0027s your name? Just so I can say I was here.\"\n \"Rivera.\" Carlos nodded again, staring at Damali. \"You wanted vengeance? Then do him.\"\n She looked at the creatures at the doors, looked at Carlos, and glanced at the bleeding, cowering creature at Carlos\u0027s feet, which couldn\u0027t even beg for mercy. Black blood gurgled up where a plea might have been issued, and she took her time coming near the living carnage.\n \"She\u0027ll get a stomach for it,\" one called out from the cavern. \"Give her time, man. She\u0027s fine, though... can see why you had to do him for her.\" It shrugged and pounded fists with the others. \"If I was your rank, woulda done the same thing, man. It\u0027s all good.\"\n \"The longer you take, Damali, the longer this sonofabitch suffers. If you\u0027re gonna be a huntress, then hunt, Neteru. Or, if you want him to suffer, that\u0027s cool, too. Your choice, baby.\"\n \"You already put him down,\" she whispered, staring down at Nuit. \"I\u0027ve only done them while in the heat of battle - never like this.\"\n \"Then I want you to think about it this way - there are several women on the ground out there who I have to behead to be sure they don\u0027t wake up one night. I had to stand there and tell my brother I loved him and rip his heart out while I put a stake in it. I had to drive a stake through my boys\u0027 hearts, and it drove one through mine - trust me. And this motherfucker will reconstitute in a few days and come looking for you. Make a choice, Damali, like you said for the audience - make it fast.\"\n She stood over Nuit and said a mental prayer. Carlos backed away. Then the prayer found her lips, and Carlos covered his ears while Nuit began to screech and smolder. The creatures in the hall hissed their discontent. And she asked that Nuit\u0027s soul be saved, sending him into the light till he caught flame. She waited, watching the slow fire, before she plunged Isis with her full weight behind it.\n Weakened, the other vampires covered their mouths and shook their heads while dry heaving. Carlos leaned against the wall as Damali turned to all of them and narrowed her gaze on them.\n \"Damn... sister... that was cold. You didn\u0027t have to go there. Coulda let him have a little pride on the way out. A prayer? Deep.\"\n \"Fucked up, is what it was, for real for real. Burnt off the contact, too - damn, she blew my high behind that.\"\n \"Aw, man, brother - you got a cold woman on your hands. You got dat!\"\n \"I still can\u0027t wait to tell the brothas how this hit went down, though. We be out, boss.\"\n \"You want this take-out cuisine left at your door, or do you need it for later, you know... after you and the lady hook up? Just asking, don\u0027t wanna to see good food go to waste. We can leave you one, as an appetizer?\"\n \"Take \u0027em,\" Carlos murmured. \"Just don\u0027t let them wake up and walk.\"\n She stared at him as the beasts left the cavern entrance and half shut the broken doors. Smoldering ash remained, emitting sulfur in a slow, steady stream. Carlos sat down heavily on the end of the slab and studied his hands, cleaning them with his mind.\n \"I better take you to go find your team, and get you back onstage,\" he whispered.\n \"Yeah,\" she said quietly. \"It\u0027s all done down here.\"\n He shook his head, and glanced up at her. \"Baby, it\u0027s never done down here.\"\n \"So, what are you going to do?\"\n He chuckled. \"I don\u0027t know. Just started a legend... had to save face - couldn\u0027t have \u0027em say I was no punk.\" Carlos stood. \"The sulfur is dying down, the prayer is wearing off, the silver\u0027s effect ain\u0027t jack right now, but the way you look in the suit is killing me. You\u0027re working it like you worked the audience... and working me along with it. You\u0027re stronger. I\u0027ve just seen you do some incredibly sexy shit, and you smell - \" Carlos swallowed hard and paused. \"Woman... listen, it\u0027s almost past midnight. I burned a lot of energy, I\u0027m extremely hungry, and I need to get you to your people. Hopefully your team is intact.\"\n He watched her hesitate and he closed his eyes against the slow pull she was having on him again. \"I heard your song... I remember. Trust me. I kept everything you wrote from those days, like you used to read to me on the beach. But - a lotta shit has gone down, to put it mildly. And you see how they deliver takeout down here. A vampire and a vegetarian is a stretch. So, let\u0027s go, while I\u0027ve got a little noble left in me.\"\n She nodded, and stooped to pick up her dagger. \"I hope you choose well. Would have liked to see you around again.\"\n \"Damali, noble is wearing thin. Get your blade, baby. Keep it, and me, in front of you.\"\n \"We have to take the slow tunnels. My team went in there - maybe we can meet them halfway.\"\n He stopped and turned around and stared at her for a long time, branding her image into his mind.\n \"If they took the slow tunnels, I doubt they made it, D. The Vampire Council is looking for you, and the registry just ran blood - a master went down, and a whole line is up for grabs. You\u0027re in a war zone. All seconds and thirds are dusted upon my command. Only weaker strains remain, and they get folded up under my turf. It\u0027s done like that, so I can pick my own lieutenants without issues, but I don\u0027t have any at present. You understand - the tunnels are crawling, the demon empires just went to war on those rogue demons that sided with Nuit, and I probably have some real old, powerful dudes on my ass looking for you to be with me.\"\n He winked at her, appraising her and letting out a deep breath as he stood. \"That\u0027s the only reason you\u0027re getting out of this room right now. I ain\u0027t that noble, survival has somethin\u0027 to do with it.\"\n \"Watch your back,\" she said, trying to resist the pull to him. He\u0027d normalized and she held that image of him in her mind.\n Carlos rubbed his jaw and turned away, glanced at the door, then glanced at her, and tore himself from the seductive thought - it left a warm spot where his mind had touched her.\n \"I can\u0027t, no, correction, I won\u0027t leave my team.\"\n Deadlocked in a standoff, she began walking.\n \"I\u0027ll go in alone.\"\n \"No, you won\u0027t.\"\n \"Then watch my back,\" she commanded. \"You might run shit down here, but you never ran me.\"\n He smiled as he followed her. He wasn\u0027t sure why he was allowing himself to be led into a sure kill, but the rear view of her in ripped, dirty silver from this vantage point was threatening his reason.\n \"Look,\" he called behind her. \"You need to get back to the main cavern in the next five or less. They\u0027re doing the Raise the Dead act above, but it\u0027s been neutralized. The portals are closed from your prayer-songs, and the head of the line is toast. However, when your team steps back into the center of that cavern, based on the ceremony timing, it\u0027s going to suck everything in it up onto stage again. You don\u0027t want to miss that elevator ride.\"\n She peered at him and he backed away into the shadows.\n \"Raise your sword, baby. Send a signal; give the people hope. Show five continents that tonight, the light was what got raised from the dead. It came straight up from Hell, and was gorgeous.\"\n \"Come with us!\"\n \"No. If I come up with you, I\u0027m a marked man. The televisions can\u0027t pick me up - but the Vampire Council can send a hit to do me right there onstage, if they think there\u0027s been a double-cross. You understand? I have one goal, to reunite you with your team in that center cavern, then I\u0027m gone.\"\n \"But - \"\n \"No buts about it. I need to handle my business. You are already handling yours.\"\n \"You could have bitten me at any time - why didn\u0027t you?\"\n She saw two glowing orbs in the shadows disappear and the reappear with the sound of a deep inhale.\n \"You have five minutes of juice left in the new battery on your suit. You could have toasted me and Nuit at any time, and gotten rid of both of us. Why didn\u0027t you?\"\n For a moment, she said nothing.\n \"Yeah, I feel you, baby,\" he murmured, his voice smooth, controlled, sensual in the dark.\n \"I need to find my team.\"\n \"Yeah, you sure do.\"\n \"You need to take the lead down here,\" she murmured. \"I don\u0027t know the way, and I should probably stay downwind from you so we can make it topside.\"\n \"Glad you finally understand where I\u0027m coming from,\" he said on a ragged breath, rounding her in the dark and taking the lead. \"Wise choice.\"\n A low flicker of light made Carlos and Damali start running faster. Moving bodies ran toward them, dragging wounded, and the numbers had considerably thinned. Carlos\u0027s line of vision narrowed, and he could sense her trying to see farther than was possible. Even with her unique ability, the night was his, and he had the advantage.\n \"Listen, D, brace yourself. There are only twelve standing, and not all twelve are completely standing. You started with a squad of nineteen. The reason we made it this far without incident is probably because they took the weight as decoys.\"\n \"Oh, no!\"\n \"Yeah - but it wasn\u0027t your fault. That\u0027s their job... they\u0027re guardians. They have to be willing to lay down their lives for a Neteru.\"\n Running beside Carlos, she let the remorse sink into her bones. No person should have to make that choice, no matter how honorable. Guilt dug into her side as the run sent a stab of pain through it. The battling, the stage, the run, were all taking their toll. The twinge felt like it was gouging her appendix, and she slowed her gait, and had to catch her breath as another shooting pain ripped through her abdomen.\n Bent over, she heaved in air, and in slow motion, she watched Carlos stop, turn away from her, and growl.\n \"Get to your team! Now!\"\n She could barely breathe, much less run, and she pushed herself up and looked at the dim light that was coming closer. \"I don\u0027t know what it is. I think I may have been hit... when I fell, some internal injury that just - \"\n \"Get to your team,\" Carlos said in an agonized voice, but much softer. \"Please, before they kill me. Run toward the light - I got\u0027chure back.\"\n Half running, half dragging herself, she brushed past him. Isis was making a line in the rock at her feet as Damali stumbled forward pulling it behind her, one arm in front of her waist clutching the dagger.\n \"Neteru!\" the Templar called out. \"Are you hurt?\"\n \"No,\" Damali wheezed, making it to the border of light, her gaze counting faces, heads. \"Roll call,\" she whispered, tears now streaming down her cheeks.\n \"Rider, Mar, Shabazz, J.L., Dan, Jose,\" Big Mike boomed, his breaths labored. \"And me.\" He then fell quiet, breathing hard, as the blue knight stepped forward winded and exhausted.\n Damali looked around as her assembled guardians each nodded upon Big Mike\u0027s roll call. All of them were leaning against portions of the jagged tunnel walls, trying to catch their breaths.\n \"They took the weight, li\u0027l sis,\" Mike said while grappling for air. \"Died with honor - said it was their job as front line. We\u0027re second line, and they held back things I cannot even describe. They helped us put down the guardian squad from our unit that had been nicked topside... so we didn\u0027t have to.\"\n \"Templar,\" Damali huffed, \"we cannot begin to thank you and your men. There are not enough words.\"\n \"That you are still with us unscathed, Neteru, is all that we had hoped for,\" the knight said on slow, heavy exhales.\n \"We have to move, we only have a few moments to rest,\" Marlene whispered, drawing ragged inhales from the run. \"D, you don\u0027t look good.\"\n \"I\u0027m not.\" Damali winced. \"But I\u0027m not nicked. It\u0027s my side. I cut Nuit\u0027s heart out, after Carlos neutered him. But I think I hit a wall.\" Damali stopped mid-sentence, tried to catch her breath, and continued more slowly. \"Might have some internal injuries. You\u0027re right, though. We\u0027ve gotta move, the Vampire Council is looking for Carlos, and will flood the tunnels soon. We have to get back to the open cavern in the center and wait for a lift in a few minutes or less. I\u0027ll be all right.\"\n \"Where\u0027s Carlos?\" Rider said, an odd level of concern in his voice.\n \"He left me, about twenty-five feet back and told me to run toward the light. He had my back the whole time - save one minor incident.\" She chuckled sadly. \"But he\u0027s gone.\"\n \"He\u0027s not gone,\" the Templar warned, glancing around. \"He\u0027s a master, and he\u0027s showing a lot of discipline, Neteru. Unparalleled restraint at the moment. If you can withstand the pain, we have to get you out of here before his restraint falters.\"\n Damali doubled over again as another stab in her side ripped through her abdomen.\n \"Tell her, Mar,\" Shabazz murmured. \"Once and for all.\"\n Marlene looked at Damali and glanced at the darkness behind them.\n \"It\u0027s almost midnight - you were born at twelve-oh-one... and, baby, you\u0027re in the middle of Hell, and you just started ovulating - the first adult Neteru menses. It\u0027s a rough one on the human system, that\u0027s why it hurts so much - you aren\u0027t injured. You\u0027ve gotta move, now, without us.\"\n Damali\u0027s gaze locked with Marlene\u0027s.\n \"Baby, you can take a body blow, or a bite, and you can see in the dark... Read minds, and you are making him crazy. So, baby, run. We got your back; let Isis have your front. We\u0027re dragging wounded and will slow you down. You\u0027ll draw sharks in this cavern in the next minute or two. Run!\"\n \"Run with me, Marlene - everybody. Or we all go down fighting together. We all go up into the light, together. That\u0027s the only way I\u0027m going down that tunnel - as a team.\"\n A low growl behind them made the group stop and turn fast.\n \"I tried to reason with her, too, Marlene. I tried to stay upwind from her,\" a low rumbled whispered. \"Tried to explain what she was doing to me, but... she\u0027s so damned stubborn.\"\n When J.L. moved a light near the voice, it was summarily flung away.\n \"Oh, shit... uh, look, Carlos, man - \"\n \"Shut up, Rider! Go with her, if that will make her move. I\u0027ll watch your backs; you will immediately get your bloody, mangled team out of here. You\u0027re drawing more of us, and more of them to her - the longer you all stand and have a summit meeting in the fucking cavern about this!\"\n A section of the cavern wall gave way, and falling gravel and dirt made the team cover their heads.\n \"I can keep them from your back, but I can\u0027t guard your front,\" the voice said more calmly.\n Heavy breathing echoed in the cavern, as the group remained still.\n \"Come with us, Rivera,\" the Templar said quietly. \"You had faith that she could trust you, hope that you would vanquish Nuit... and love, or the Neteru could not be here with us, not without one of you being dead. Rivera, your choice is - \"\n \"Move her, now, priest! Or I take her deeper into the lair zones. You\u0027ll find that choices are very limited in my world. Decisions are also swiftly made.\"\n \"Carlos,\" Damali\u0027s voice rang out, still refusing to leave without him or her team, \"you\u0027ll be a sitting duck here for the Vampire Council. There\u0027s safety in numbers! We fought good together.\"\n Two golden orbs in the dark disappeared and came back red.\n \"That cannot be a good sign, D,\" Rider said fast. \"Let\u0027s not argue with the man. He\u0027s made his decision. He has serious issues. So let\u0027s get the fuck out of here.\"\n \"Wise choice,\" the voice rumbled. \"All of you need to roll. Quickly. You\u0027re between a rock and a hard place - me at your back, and whatever at your front. You all smell like blood, and I haven\u0027t eaten all night... and she smells...\" The voice paused. \"Fabulous. Get my woman out of here. I\u0027m not myself.\"\n \"We get the picture,\" Big Mike murmured, as the group began to move out. \"Let\u0027s give boss some space. He\u0027s compromised - and it\u0027s real cool of him to give notice.\"\n \"What did you say?\" Damali murmured as she walked toward the darkness, and Big Mike put a hand on her shoulder.\n \"Her voice is running all through me... Baby, go \u0027head. For real. You don\u0027t understand this craving... yet.\" The red glow disappeared from the darkness.\n Marlene and Shabazz glanced at each other.\n \"Uh, people,\" Dan whispered, \"I think that\u0027s our cue.\"\n \"Y\u0027all deal wit your shit later,\" Shabazz said, his tone firm. \"We be out.\"\n \"Big time,\" Rider yelled as the group backed up. \"See, that\u0027s youth. People our age only gotta be told once.\"\n \"Leave him, D,\" Marlene said, as a growl came nearer.\n \"He\u0027s one of us - we don\u0027t leave our own! I saw him fight back there. He fought like a guardian. He didn\u0027t harm me. He was once a guardian, too, and it may not be too late! Carlos, listen to the Templar and come with us - \"\n \"I\u0027m not one of you, beautiful vision . . .\" Carlos\u0027s voice echoed through the cavern in a low, seductive murmur, bouncing off the walls, now making it difficult to locate his position in the darkness. The intensity of it made the sounds beyond them go quiet for a moment, the way birds and crickets go still when a loping predator passes. \"Damali, raise your sword, baby, before you have to plant it in my chest.\"\n His voice was rendered at such a low, sensual octave of warning that the walls vibrated from the sound of it even after he\u0027d stopped speaking. Wisdom instantly assaulted her, and she turned away from the darkness to quickly usher her team through the cavern toward safety - but her mind was left in an invisible corner as they ran, and she glanced back repeatedly hoping what was in it would follow. He was one of them; they didn\u0027t leave their own. Running as a small huddle, they turned after a hundred yards when they heard a fight ensue behind them. Loud snarls and snaps and screeches echoed behind them. Damali turned to head back.\n \"Leave him, huntress!\"\n Reality jolted her and they continued to run, now in a flat-out dash down the treacherous area before them. Hideous sounds were advancing, a loud cry rang through the cavern - it was male, it was low like a mortal wound... it was Carlos.\n \"No!\" Damali turned again, but Big Mike held her, shoving her ahead of him.\n \"Push forward toward the light. You can\u0027t help him now - whatever\u0027s got him, got him!\"\n She ran as hard and as fast as she could, helping to drag the knight\u0027s wounded teammates, helping Jose, her side killing her, the sound of a fierce vampire battle behind her stabbing her heart. It was a vertical thrust with no mercy in it, goring her as she listened to Carlos\u0027s roars of agony behind her. \"Die with honor... but live with pride,\" she whispered as she raced. \"Live!\"\n They stood gathered in the small, confining space where they\u0027d first been dropped - the allied teams gasping for air, sucking in the sulfur, the putrid after-stench of vampire extinction. Guardians surrounded her in Templar formation; her team a center ring, then the Templars, and she at the core. Damali glanced at a revived Jose, who could now live, also knowing his loss, like hers, would never be erased. She briefly closed her eyes, the burn of the environment becoming grit behind her lids, waiting for the lift, and listening as the pathways behind them went still. That\u0027s when her hand found her mouth, and she looked back just one last time. What if... Please, God, even down here.\n Things of the night slithered into the space around them, vampires, demons, all manner of creatures unnamed. And as her weary team drew together, surrounded, back to back, the last of their weapons readied to go down as one - she quieted her team with a silent prayer, and lit herself as a torch.\n Ultraviolet light filled the space from her suit and fried everything in its wake that wasn\u0027t human. Billowing black clouds mixed with yellow and deep crimson, screams so horrific that the guardians covered their ears and a small avalanche started. Damali raised her sword upon a whisper... \"For Carlos. Rest in peace.\"\n It was not clear whether the subterranean disturbance, the timing, or the light jettisoned them upward, ejecting them back to the place where they\u0027d first been swallowed. But her team stood firm, surrounding her - then fanned out one-by-one on an electric blue-lit stage with black smoke behind them, the Vampire huntress in the circle\u0027s center, all slowly stepping forward for the cheering crowd, her sword raised in salute to those who got left behind.\n Media swamped them, the crowd rushed the barricades, and the team looked on as commentators thrust microphones in their faces... there were no words. Who cared that they\u0027d brought the house down? It wasn\u0027t magic; it was a miracle, and there was no way to explain something as complicated as that.\n Damali closed her eyes, leaned her head back, swallowed hard, and raised Isis higher for the applauding, cheering crowd... the refrain of a very sad song echoed in her mind. She tried to send it by thought to someone she once knew.\n Remember before it all got crazy? Please, baby, don\u0027t ever forget.\n EPILOGUE\n Previous Top\n Detective Berkfield sat at his desk, looking at the package that had come to him with no name and no address. The note inside of it said simply, The Jamaican Territory - as promised.\n For a month, nothing, and now this came in the mail? He looked up as his new partner leaned in his doorway.\n \"Hey, Dick, I know you\u0027re brown-nosing for the next big promotion, but it\u0027s getting late. You wanna get something to eat?\"\n \"Naw,\" he said slowly, holding the package in his hands. \"I think I\u0027m gonna hang here for a while longer.\"\n \"Why, man? You have to eat. You\u0027re gonna mess up your bio-rhythms, working all night all the time, and then crashing at dawn.\"\n \"Yeah, I know... but I got a funny feeling I\u0027m going to get a phone call soon.\" Berkfield\u0027s gaze slid out of the window toward the blue moon. \"Don\u0027t ask me why, I can\u0027t even tell you - just a feeling, is all. Next time. Be careful going home though... say a little prayer; works for me. Catch ya later.\"\n THE LEGENDS CONTINUE WITH\n THE\n HUNTED\n A VAMPIRE HUNTRESS LEGEND\n COMING JUNE 2004\n TAKE A SNEAK PEEK\n He had to get out of there. The look of shock, relief, disappointment, and rage on Damali\u0027s face was working every cell in his body. She hadn\u0027t said a word, just circled him, staring, her blade held low, moving counterclockwise to him like she\u0027d lunge at any moment. Her team was not his greatest danger. The Covenant team was not his greatest danger. She was. He needed to roll.\n \"J.L., hit the exteriors, all right?\"\n J.L. nodded, but Damali held up her hand. Everyone stood still, waiting. The room crackled with quiet. The hum of air-conditioner compressors created a sump-pump sound in the distance. A stereo was on somewhere in the compound. The humans had enough adrenaline oozing from their bodies to give him a contact high. He could see their eyes blink in slow motion as they stared at his and Damali\u0027s circling forms. The pores on their faces enlarged within his peripheral vision. He could detect the moment a bead of sweat exited their skin. His tongue glided over his lips and he tasted salt. The tension in their muscles increased, springs wound so tightly that at any moment they would pop. It fused with his reflexes. He felt the air, sensing for a weapon release. He smelled their blood, twelve nervous humans with hearts beating a rhythm out of their chests.\n \"I have to go,\" Carlos murmured, his gaze steady on Damali.\n She shook her head slowly no. It was a millimeter of movement. Her locks swayed ever so much. The adornments in her hair and her earrings chimed. Lion\u0027s teeth, a tiny silver charm... Ankh fertility symbols created natural music at a nearly imperceptible timbre. Her pupils had eclipsed her irises. Shea butter, almond oil - the scent of her was an intoxicating blend with something else she emitted... something different than Neteru. He\u0027d smelled it on her before, but couldn\u0027t place it. Her face and arms glistened. The muscles beneath her smooth skin were a network of taut, steel-like cable. He could hear the blood pumping through her veins as she stalked him. She was gorgeous, poetry in motion. The crocheted white dress had holes that showed skin. As she moved, the dress moved with her body, barely concealing it. The fluorescent lights glinted off of Isis and sent shards of illumination against patches of warm, damp flesh.\n He allowed his gaze to roll over her in a slow undressing. \"I have to go,\" he repeated more firmly, his voice dropping an octave. He had meant it as a statement, but even to his own ears, it had come out as a plea.\n \"You talk to me,\" she whispered through her teeth and stopped circling.\n \"Oh, shit...\" Rider backed up a few paces and leveled his shotgun.\n \"Shut up, Rider,\" Marlene snapped.\n Damali\u0027s eyes had never left Carlos\u0027s. All she did was hold up her hand and her team went still once more.\n \"We should leave,\" the eldest cleric said quietly. \"Before somebody gets hurt.\"\n Carlos shook his head no.\n \"Oh, what the fuck.\" Rider threw Big Mike a crossbow, and he caught it, nodding. Rider glanced at the clerics. \"I thought you had an understanding with dude?\"\n \"We do, and it\u0027s time to leave,\" Father Patrick insisted. \"If it\u0027s not too late.\"\n The Covenant team backed up, cautiously rounded Damali and Carlos, standing the line on the side of the guardians with weapons raised. J.L. had armed himself with a battle-ax; even Dan and Jose now had silver-tipped stakes in their hands. Shabazz had pulled Sleeping Beauty out of her holster.\n Marlene folded her arms and leaned against the weapons table. \"Steady, gentlemen. Nobody get an itchy trigger finger. Stay cool. Have faith.\"\n \"Have faith? Mar - \"\n \"Shabazz, we know how this has to go down.\"\n Damali blocked out the other voices, her goal singular, focused. There was no shred of trust in her as she looked at the master vampire that had made her taste fear. She had to remember what he was, not allow the illusion to get to her. This liar had fooled trusting clerics. Carlos was dead. This was something else. And this entity possessing a familiar body, had shape-shifted to trick her team, had rolled up on her in a battle station-ready compound, and dissected her while she was blind. The worst part of it all was he\u0027d been right. If it had been Fallon Nuit, she would have been dead... or worse. What did this thing want?\n \"Speak to me!\"\n \"It\u0027s me, Damali - Carlos... use your third eye!\"\n \"You\u0027re a liar! Carlos is dead!\"\n She circled, she moved with him. She was indeed more dangerous to him than sunlight at present.\n \"I can\u0027t get a mind-lock,\" Carlos told Marlene and the seer cleric, his line of vision shifting quickly to gain their assistance. \"She\u0027s in a mental black box.\"\n \"Don\u0027t screw with my team! They don\u0027t have the telepathic capacity - I don\u0027t care what illusions you throw at them - \"\n \"No, Damali,\" Marlene argued. \"Listen - \"\n \"No! They sent this one as a trap; it\u0027s a decoy. I heard Carlos die - I saw it! Vamps are masters of deception.\" She narrowed her gaze on the entity before her. \"How dare you assume his shape... I\u0027ll gut you,\" she seethed, her grip tightening on Isis.\n \"Then plant Isis,\" Carlos said. \"Plant it right in the brand.\" In one deft motion he tore away the black T-shirt to expose his scar. Hot tears of frustration stood in his eyes. \"How did I get that, then, huh, Damali? Ask the damned men who pulled me out of a cave in the desert! Ask them how they found me! It saved my life and I suffered for three nights in the fucking desert.\"\n Carlos slapped the center of his chest as Damali\u0027s hand slowly covered her mouth. \"I got this carrying you, baby,\" he said, his voice fractured. \"You\u0027re the only one that can do me in this room.\"\n He closed his eyes, outstretched his arms, and leaned his head back. Her legs moved beneath her, hurling her toward the thing claiming to be Carlos, sword raised. She heard Marlene scream, \"No!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-awakening-vampire-huntress-legend-2/page-11.html","bookId":2526,"book":{"id":2526,"title":"The Awakening (Vampire Huntress Legend #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Awakening (Vampire Huntress Legend #2) \n A battle is brewing in the underworld, and at the center of it all is Damali Richards, spoken word artist and vampire huntress.
