{"id":8850,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII GERALD LEAVES PORTVILLE","content":"On his way to church the next day Gerald fell in with Richard Childs, a stout, manly boy of sixteen. \"I want to speak to you, Gerald,\" said Richard. \"Mr. Tubbs has offered me a place in his store. I don\u0027t want to accept it till I learn whether I am depriving you of employment.\" \"No, Dick. I have given Mr. Tubbs notice that I must leave him.\" \"Are you going back to school?\" \"No; I am offered employment by Mr. Nugent.\" Richard looked puzzled. \"What does he want with a boy?\" \"I am going to travel for him on business. You mustn\u0027t ask particulars, for the business is private.\" \"All right. Then I will accept; but I have told Mr. Tubbs he must pay me four dollars.\" \"What did he say?\" \"He talked for an hour, but my father backed me up, and he will have to pay it.\" Mrs. Lane and Abel made various attempts to draw from Gerald the name of the place to which he was going, but he steadfastly refused to tell. \"I don\u0027t know but I shall refuse my consent to your going,\" said his stepmother. \"In that case you will have me at home doing nothing.\" \"I might send you back to Mr. Tubbs.\" \"He has already engaged Richard Childs in my place.\" \"I wish I were going with you,\" said Abel. \"It is awfully stupid in Portville.\" \"I will bring you home a present, Abel,\" said Gerald. Abel brightened up. He was naturally an avaricious boy, and was ready to accept whatever came his way. \"Then I hope you\u0027ll come back soon,\" he said. \"Thank you!\" The train on which Gerald was to be a passenger was to leave Portville at ten o\u0027clock. Gerald had an invitation to breakfast at Mr. Nugent\u0027s in order to receive final instructions and to be provided with money. \"I have but fifty dollars here, Gerald,\" said the old gentleman, \"but I will give you a check on the Park National Bank of New York for a hundred and fifty. Probably that will be sufficient for you till you reach your destination.\" \"It seems to me a good deal of money, Mr. Nugent.\" \"Traveling is expensive, and it is not necessary for you to be economical. I want you to be comfortable. It will be best for you to carry your money in different places, not all in your pocketbook. Have you an inside pocket in your vest?\" \"Yes, sir, but I never made any use of it.\" \"I will get my housekeeper to attach a button and make a button-hole, for better security. You can wear one of my vests while she is doing it.\" \"Shall I have any difficulty in drawing the money from the bank?\" \"No; I will indorse the check and make it payable to you.\" He drew a check for one hundred and fifty dollars, and indorsed it in this way. On the back he wrote: \"Correct. John Nugent.\" \"You will have no trouble now,\" he said. \"You will reach New York before twelve o\u0027clock, and may as well cash the check and buy your ticket to Chicago. For the balance of the day you can go about wherever you please. I advise you to be careful and prudent, as you will have a considerable amount of money in your possession.\" When Gerald reached the railroad station he found Abel on the platform. Abel followed him to the ticket office and listened while he called for a ticket to New York. \"So you\u0027re going to New York?\" he said. \"Yes,\" answered Gerald. \"I wish ma would let me go with you. I s\u0027pose you\u0027ll be back before the end of the week?\" \"I don\u0027t know how long it will take to attend to Mr. Nugent\u0027s business.\" \"When you get through that you\u0027ll be out of work,\" said Abel, with pleased anticipation. \"I won\u0027t count so far ahead as that. Well, there is the train. Good-by!\" \"So long! Write to me, if you get a chance.\" \"I can\u0027t promise.\" The train started, and Abel watched it till it was out of sight. \"I wish I knew where Gerald is going, and what he is going to do. I wonder if there is work enough for two? I\u0027ve a great mind to call on old Nugent, and ask him.\" Mr. Nugent was considerably surprised when the servant came up and told him a boy was below who wished to see him. \"It can\u0027t be Gerald Lane come back!\" he said to himself. When Abel entered the room Mr. Nugent was glad to find that this suspicion was unfounded. \"Good morning, young man,\" he said. \"Do you wish to see me?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I don\u0027t think I know you.\" \"I am Abel Tyler, stepbrother of Gerald Lane.\" \"Oh, yes! I think I saw you yesterday in Mrs. Lane\u0027s pew.\" \"I just saw Gerald off for New York.\" \"And came to tell me of it? You are very kind.\" \"Yes, sir. I suppose Gerald is goin\u0027 to attend to some business for you in New York?\" \"Yes,\" replied the old gentleman, quietly. \"I thought perhaps there might be business enough for two persons. In that case I should be very glad to join him, and help.\" \"You are very considerate. Should that be the case I can send for you.\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Abel, eagerly. \"I suppose your mother would not object to your undertaking it?\" \"No, sir. I know New York better than Gerald. He has never been there more than two or three times.\" \"I will bear that in mind.\" John Nugent resumed reading the morning paper, and Abel felt that he was dismissed. He rose, and, bidding Mr. Nugent good-by in an airy manner, left the house. \"That may lead to something,\" he said to himself, complacently. \"The old man seemed rather struck by my appearance.\" It is just as well that Abel did not know how Mr. Nugent had really been impressed. On the way home he stepped into the grocery. \"Well, Mr. Tubbs, I\u0027ve just seen Gerald off,\" he said. \"Where has he gone?\" asked the grocer, not without curiosity. \"He has gone to New York to attend to some business for Mr. Nugent.\" \"Business! A boy like that! The old man must be crazy.\" \"I think so myself. However, it\u0027s a good thing for Gerald.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. It won\u0027t take more\u0027n a week likely.\" \"Well, that\u0027s something.\" \"And then he\u0027ll be out of work. He\u0027d better have remained with me.\" \"That\u0027s what ma thought, but Gerald is very obstinate.\" \"He\u0027ll be comin\u0027 and ask me to take him back,\" said Mr. Tubbs, \"but I don\u0027t know as I can. I\u0027ve got a boy. Richard, you may take a bushel of potatoes over to Mrs. Scott\u0027s. There may be some other articles to take out. You can ask Mr. Brandon.\" \"Are you going to ride?\" asked Abel. \"Yes; I shall go in the wagon.\" \"May I go with you?\" \"If you want to,\" answered Richard, with no great alacrity. Meanwhile Gerald kept on his way to the great city. He enjoyed the trip, and his spirits rose as he sped rapidly on. At length he reached the Grand Central depot, and left the train along with the rest of the passengers. Just outside he fell in with a bootblack, a lively specimen of the New York gamin. \"Have a shine, country?\" he asked. Gerald smiled. \"I blacked my boots before I came away.\" \"Do you call that a shine?\" said the boy, disdainfully. \"You don\u0027t understand the business.\" \"Can you do better?\" \"I\u0027ll shine \u0027em up so you can see your face in \u0027em.\" \"Go ahead, then.\" The boy started in, and was as good as his word. \"How\u0027s that?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s the best shine I ever had. What do you charge?\" \"Generally I get five cents, but I\u0027ve got a note to meet at the bank, and I\u0027d like ten.\" \"All right; you shall have it. Now, can you tell me where to find the Park National Bank?\" \"That\u0027s the bank my note\u0027s in. Take them cars, and they\u0027ll carry you there.\" He pointed to a car which was just then passing, and Gerald boarded it. In less than half an hour he entered the Park Bank and made his way to the paying teller. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82357.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
