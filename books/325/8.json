{"id":8841,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII A COLD RECEPTION","content":"\"I don\u0027t think she is,\" said Abel, reddening with mortification. Just then Mrs. Lane\u0027s voice was heard from the head of the stairs. \"Who are you talking with, Abel?\" \"It\u0027s me, Melindy—your brother Alonzo,\" said Mr. Crane. Mrs. Lane descended the stairs slowly, looking very much annoyed. She was ashamed of her plebeian brother, and very much disturbed that Gerald should have seen him. It occurred to her to deny the relationship, but this seemed impracticable. So she said with an ill grace, not even offering her hand: \"What brought you here, Alonzo?\" \"I reckon the cars brought me here, Melindy. It does me good to see you well fixed. You have feathered your nest well, I must say.\" Mrs. Lane bit her lips. \"You can come in and sit down,\" she said. \"I shall be glad if you will talk more like a gentleman.\" \"But I\u0027m not a gentleman, Melindy. I am an honest, hard-working blacksmith. Carrie and the children send their love.\" \"I am obliged to them,\" said Mrs. Lane, stiffly. \"I wonder you could get away from your work for a visit.\" \"Well, the truth is, Melindy, I\u0027m in hard luck. My shop burned down day before yesterday, and I need money to build it up again.\" \"Wasn\u0027t it insured?\" asked his sister, coldly. \"The insurance ran out a month ago. So I naturally thought of my only sister who is a rich woman, and I\u0027ve come to ask a loan of two hundred dollars. That, I calculate, will set me on my feet again.\" \"The estate is not yet settled, and even if it were I should not feel at liberty to take Mr. Lane\u0027s money for such a purpose.\" \"I reckon you\u0027ll spend it on yourself and Abel, Melindy.\" \"My husband left a son.\" \"I know that, and he\u0027s a gentleman, too,\" said Mr. Crane, with a kindly glance at Gerald. \"If he had money I am sure he would help me.\" \"Yes, Mr. Crane; I would,\" said Gerald. \"We won\u0027t discuss that matter now, Alonzo. As you are here, you can stay for the balance of the day.\" \"I shall have to stay till to-morrow, as there is no train from Portville till then. I hope you won\u0027t forget the help I gave you and Abel when you were first left a widder.\" \"It isn\u0027t very becoming to twit me with any little favors I may have accepted from you in the past,\" said Mrs. Lane. \"If you want me to receive you in a friendly way, you must behave and talk differently.\" As Mr. Crane went into the house, following his not over-cordial relative, Gerald walked away. He felt that he had no place in the family conclave, and was only sorry that it was not likely to prove very satisfactory to his new acquaintance. He walked away, and, having nothing else to occupy his time, went to the lake and got into his rowboat. He rowed about lazily for half an hour when he heard a voice from the bank. Looking up, he saw Alonzo Crane standing on the blink of the pond. \"Hello, Gerald!\" he called out, \"won\u0027t you give me a ride in your boat?\" \"Certainly, Mr. Crane,\" and he rowed up to a little pier near where his new acquaintance was standing. Alonzo Crane stepped into the boat and took a seat near the stern. \"This is a nice dory of yours,\" he said. \"I always liked a rowboat, but I\u0027ve been too busy in my business to use one. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve been in a boat for five years. Did my sister give it to you?\" \"No,\" answered Gerald, hastily; \"it was a gift from my father.\" \"I suppose, from what Melindy says, he left you most of his property?\" \"She doesn\u0027t say that to me. She says it is all hers, and that I am entirely dependent upon her.\" \"Whew! Well, that beats all. Wasn\u0027t your father friendly to you?\" \"I always found him the best of fathers, and that makes me wonder at his leaving me dependent upon Mrs. Lane.\" Alonzo Crane looked thoughtful. \"You don\u0027t suspect nothing?\" he said, interrogatively. \"What should I suspect?\" asked Gerald. \"Well,\" said Alonzo, slowly, \"Melindy always was tricky. She was always set on gettin\u0027 money, and I don\u0027t think she\u0027d be over scrupulous. There might be such a thing as forgin\u0027 a will, though I don\u0027t know as I ought to say that considerin\u0027 that Melindy is my sister.\" \"Thank you for suggesting it, at any rate, Mr. Crane. The time may come when I shall look into the matter. At present I am only a boy——\" \"And a boy ain\u0027t no match for a woman like Melindy. Oh, she\u0027s cunning! What do you think she said to get rid of lendin\u0027 me any money?\" \"I can\u0027t guess.\" \"She said that she must provide for you.\" Gerald smiled, bitterly. \"Because it would serve her purpose,\" he responded. \"She has given Abel my place in the house. She has taken from me the large room I have for years occupied—given it to Abel—and put me in a small hall bedroom adjoining.\" \"That\u0027s too bad! Abel is a mean, conceited little upstart, who don\u0027t treat me half decent, though he would more than once have gone without a meal but for the help I gave his mother.\" \"Has Mrs. Lane refused to loan you money to rebuild your shop?\" \"Yes; she won\u0027t think of it. She says I must have been careless, or the fire wouldn\u0027t have happened. It hasn\u0027t done much good to come to Portville. The only pleasure I\u0027ve got out of it is meeting you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Crane. I wish your sister were more like you.\" \"I\u0027m a rough man, Gerald. There ain\u0027t much polish about me, but nobody can charge me with being mean and ungrateful. Some time I hope you\u0027ll come and see me.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Crane. It may come about some day. Is there no one in your town who will lend you money to rebuild your shop?\" \"No; there ain\u0027t much money in Hillsdale. It\u0027s just a common country town, and the people are mostly farmers. I don\u0027t know what to do.\" And a look of sadness overspread his rugged countenance. \"You are no worse off than I am, Mr. Crane. I have lost an indulgent father, and am left dependent upon a woman I cannot like or respect.\" \"It does seem hard.\" \"But I have faith that some time things will come out for the best.\" Gerald spoke gravely and calmly. He had been brought up to trust in God, and to have faith in His goodness. His words, young as he was, seemed to have a cheering effect on Mr. Crane. \"You\u0027re right, Gerald,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ll try to believe things are comin\u0027 out right, though I can\u0027t see how.\" \"Why did you leave the house so soon, Mr. Crane? I thought you would have a long conversation with your sister and Abel.\" \"I thought so, too, but Melindy didn\u0027t seem to hanker much after my company. About fifteen minutes after you went out, she said: \u0027I shall have to leave you, as I have an errand in the village. Perhaps Abel will stay with you?\u0027\" \"\u0027No, I can\u0027t,\u0027 said Abel. \u0027I\u0027m going to play ball with some of the boys.\u0027\" Gerald smiled. \"None of the boys have invited Abel to play ball. They don\u0027t like him.\" \"Well, it don\u0027t make no difference. He wouldn\u0027t have been any company to me. It\u0027s strange that you seem a good deal nearer to me than my own kin.\" \"I am very glad of that. I wish I were in a position to help you.\" \"Perhaps you will be some day. If there\u0027s anything crooked about that will of your pa\u0027s, it\u0027ll come out right some time. Well, when Melindy and Abel had left me I thought I\u0027d go out and take a walk. I strayed down to the lake and saw you rowing. I made bold to call to you. Would you mind my trying the oars to see if I\u0027ve forgot how to row?\" \"Take them and welcome.\" Mr. Crane took the oars, and, though he was at first awkward, he soon showed that he had not altogether forgotten his old skill. \"Well, I can row a little,\" he said, complacently. \"Yes, Mr. Crane, you can row better than Abel. He went out with me a day or two ago, and upset the boat.\" \"Did he tumble out?\" asked Mr. Crane, laughing. \"Yes; and as he can\u0027t swim, he might have drowned if I hadn\u0027t got hold of him.\" \"Did he thank you for saving his life?\" \"No.\" \"And he never will. It isn\u0027t in his nature.\" \"So far from that, he tried to make out that I upset the boat by moving about in it. That\u0027s what he told his mother to account for his wet clothes.\" \"Just like him. I\u0027m ashamed to have such a nephew. It would have served him right if you had left him to his fate.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t have advised that, I am sure, Mr. Crane.\" \"No, I don\u0027t know as I would; though it makes me mad to see a boy so mean and ungrateful.\" For half an hour they remained in the boat talking about various subjects. Alonzo Crane evidently enjoyed the trip. \"I\u0027m glad I came to Portville after all,\" he said. But there was a sudden and startling interruption. From a large house a hundred feet from the lake a sheet of flame became visible. Gerald saw it first. \"Mr. Nugent\u0027s house is on fire!\" he exclaimed. \"Let us land and see if we can give any assistance.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82348.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
