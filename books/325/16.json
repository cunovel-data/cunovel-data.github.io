{"id":8849,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI MRS. LANE\u0027S SURPRISE","content":"Considering his new and brilliant prospects, Gerald was not particularly disturbed by Abel\u0027s words. He didn\u0027t take the trouble to reply, but went at once into the sitting-room, where, with a frowning face, Mrs. Lane awaited him. \"This is a fine time to come home,\" she said, abruptly. \"It is rather late, Mrs. Lane,\" said Gerald, calmly, \"but I could not very well reach home earlier.\" \"Did you come from the store as soon as it closed?\" \"No, madam.\" \"I suppose you went to the billiard-room; I understand that you frequent that disreputable place.\" \"Then you are misinformed. I went there one evening with Mr. Brandon, Mr. Tubbs\u0027 clerk.\" \"Where, then, did you go?\" \"To Mr. Nugent\u0027s.\" \"You seem to have struck up quite an intimacy with Mr. Nugent,\" said his stepmother, with a sneer. \"I hope you don\u0027t consider him a disreputable person, Mrs. Lane.\" \"You are impertinent. You have no right to annoy him by late visits.\" \"I don\u0027t. He is always glad to see me; to-night, particularly, he had some business which he wished to talk over with me.\" Abel laughed. \"Hear him talk, ma!\" he said. \"Just as if Mr. Nugent would talk over business with Gerald!\" Gerald did not think it necessary to answer this malicious remark. \"I have been over to see Mr. Tubbs to-day,\" said Mrs. Lane. Gerald looked at her inquiringly. \"And he has agreed to keep you. He still thinks that you robbed the money-drawer, but is inclined to think you will not repeat the theft.\" \"I am very much obliged to him, I am sure.\" \"You have reason to be. It is not many employers who would overlook such an offence. You could not, of course, get another position without his recommendation.\" Gerald did not reply. He waited to see what more Mrs. Lane had to say. \"Therefore you will continue to work in the grocery store.\" \"You must excuse me for saying, Mrs. Lane, that I shall not do so.\" \"You dare to say that?\" exclaimed his stepmother, flushing with indignation. \"Yes, madam.\" \"Do you expect me to support you without work? If so, you will find yourself disappointed. I shall not provide you with a home if you dare to oppose my will.\" \"It will not be necessary, Mrs. Lane. I have obtained another situation.\" \"What?\" exclaimed his stepmother, in genuine surprise. \"Who are you going to work for?\" asked Abel, his curiosity aroused. \"For Mr. Nugent.\" \"How much is he goin\u0027 to pay you?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Nor any one else, I reckon. What can he have for you to do?\" \"I am not at liberty to tell just yet.\" \"It strikes me, Gerald Lane, that I have some voice in the matter. I shall not allow you to give up a place unless you are to get one equally good.\" \"While I don\u0027t know how much I am to get, I have no doubt it will be considerably more than Mr. Tubbs pays me.\" Gerald could not have said anything better calculated to remove his stepmother\u0027s objections to his new plan. \"Very well,\" she said, calming down, \"if that\u0027s the case I don\u0027t know that I shall object. Have you no idea what you are to do?\" \"Yes, I have some idea.\" \"Tell me, then, all about it.\" \"I am not at liberty to do so. You might call on Mr. Nugent and ask him.\" \"I will do so.\" Gerald smiled to himself. He knew that Mrs. Lane would get very little information out of the old gentleman. Having no more to say Mrs. Lane suggested that it was high time they all went to bed. Gerald was quite ready to avail himself of the opportunity, for he was tired. Besides, he wanted a chance to think over the new and brilliant prospect before him. The next day Mr. Nugent was surprised by a call from Mrs. Lane. He lifted his eyes a little as she was shown into his presence. He knew her by sight, but had never spoken to her, beyond exchanging formal greetings. \"I must apologize for intruding upon you, Mr. Nugent,\" she said, \"but I am led to do so by some information which Gerald, my stepson, has given me.\" Mr. Nugent bowed, and waited to hear more. \"Gerald informed me last evening that you had offered him employment. I did not know whether to put confidence in his statement.\" \"Why not?\" asked the old gentleman, curtly. \"Because I thought it might be only an excuse for leaving Mr. Tubbs.\" \"Gerald is incapable of falsehood.\" \"I am glad you have so good an opinion of him. Then do I understand that you have offered him employment?\" \"I have.\" \"Of what nature?\" \"Pardon me, but the business is of a confidential nature.\" \"Surely, as the boy\u0027s stepmother, I have a right to information on that point.\" \"You have no right to pry into my private affairs, Mrs. Lane.\" His visitor bit her lips from irritation. \"Gerald didn\u0027t even know how much pay he was to receive.\" \"No, he does not know.\" \"He is receiving three dollars a week from Mr. Tubbs.\" \"And you don\u0027t care to have him work for less?\" said Mr. Nugent, with a smile. \"Precisely.\" \"You may set your mind at rest, then. While I don\u0027t myself know how much I shall pay him, it will be more than that.\" \"That is satisfactory, of course. I presume you know what charge Mr. Tubbs has made against Gerald?\" \"I do; but no one who knows the boy will for a moment think of crediting it.\" \"I supposed you thought so, or you would not offer him employment. Do you intend to employ him about your house?\" \"No.\" \"Then I can\u0027t see what you can have for him to do.\" \"I may tell you as much as this, Mrs. Lane: I shall send Gerald to a point at some distance to transact some business for me, being unable, from age and infirmity to make the journey myself.\" Mrs. Lane was greatly surprised. She could see that the commission was a desirable one, and would like to have secured it for her own son. \"I don\u0027t know whether you have made a wise selection of a messenger, Mr. Nugent. My son Abel is as old as Gerald.\" \"That may be, but I haven\u0027t the pleasure of knowing your son. Gerald and his father have been for some time friends of mine.\" \"When did you wish Gerald to start?\" \"On Monday.\" \"That is short notice. I don\u0027t know that I can have his clothes ready.\" \"Never mind about that. I don\u0027t want to put you to any trouble in the matter. He can take what is ready, and buy others if he has need.\" \"Will he be likely to be gone long?\" \"For some time,\" answered Mr. Nugent, indefinitely. \"Well, I trust he will satisfy you,\" said Mrs. Lane, as she rose to go. \"I have great confidence that he will.\" Meanwhile Mr. Tubbs took occasion to speak to Gerald about staying. \"Your mother was in here yesterday to see me, Gerald,\" he commenced. \"My stepmother,\" corrected Gerald. \"Oh, well, it\u0027s all the same.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"She\u0027s a very sensible woman. I agreed with her to keep you. There are some that wouldn\u0027t after what happened this week; but I don\u0027t want to be too hard upon you, considerin\u0027 you are so young, and I said I would keep you, trustin\u0027 that all will be satisfactory here after.\" \"Mr. Tubbs, I have something to say to that. I shall leave you to-night.\" \"But your mother won\u0027t allow it. You are only a boy, and——\" \"I am going to work for Mr. Nugent on Monday, Mr. Tubbs.\" \"What can he have for you to do?\" asked the grocer in surprise. \"I am to go on a journey for him, and attend to some business.\" \"That\u0027s cu\u0027rus. What can a boy like you do?\" \"You must ask him.\" \"Can\u0027t you put him off for a week? I haven\u0027t got nobody to fill your place.\" \"You might get Richard Childs, but you would have to pay him more. He is a good, strong boy.\" \"Yes, he might do; but I should like to keep you a week longer.\" \"It will be impossible, Mr. Tubbs.\" When Gerald left the grocery in the evening with three dollars in his pocket, he felt glad to bid farewell to a place that he had found so disagreeable. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82356.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
