{"id":8862,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX NERO","content":"There was no time or inclination on his part to speculate upon such an extraordinary appearance. He felt that his life was in peril, and he must consider at once whether there was any chance of his saving it. He was armed with a rifle, which thus far he had had no occasion to use. He was not unskilled in the use of firearms, and luckily the rifle was loaded. To use it seemed to be his one chance of safety. When his horse espied the lion he seemed almost paralyzed with terror. If the lion had no other claim to be called king of beasts, the terror which he inspires in all other animals might be taken for a strong evidence of his royal supremacy. The horse stood stock still, and it seemed to Gerald that he would remain so till the lion came up. This being the case, he thought it best to slip off the horse\u0027s back and jump to the ground. It was this act of his, perhaps, that startled the horse into life and motion. At any rate he set out on a wild run, attaining a pace probably unprecedented in his history. The animal could not have rendered his rider a better service. Hitherto the lion\u0027s attention had been divided between the horse and the boy. Now that he saw the horse in rapid flight, the hunting instinct came to him. More than one have testified that when they saw a person or animal running they were seized with an impulse to follow. This was the case with the lion. Apparently he did not notice Gerald, but, swerving from his course, set out in pursuit of the horse. When Gerald noted the fortunate turn that matters had taken, he breathed a sigh of deep-felt relief. But his relief was only temporary. It might not be long before the lion would overtake and kill the horse. Then, inflamed by the sight of blood, he would probably turn back and pursue the rider. What could Gerald do? HIS HORSE STOPPED ON SEEING THE LION He turned his eyes toward the distant town. Probably it was only three miles away, but it might almost as well have been three hundred. Yet to reach it was his only hope of safety. He turned and ran toward the town as fast as his legs could carry him. He soon became scant of breath. The high elevation helped to make him so. Probably the excitement, too, had its effect. He had no means of knowing whether the lion had caught up with his intended victim. Gerald fervently hoped not. The longer the horse could hold out, the more time he had to get away. He hardly dared to look, for he felt that even this might take time and so delay him. He did look up, however, and, to his infinite relief, he discovered that a horseman was speeding toward him from the town. He stood still and waited. The man stopped his horse when he saw Gerald, and asked: \"Boy, have you seen a lion hereabouts?\" The speaker had long hair, and wore a large sombrero, after the fashion of Buffalo Bill. \"Yes,\" answered Gerald, as soon as he could get his breath. \"I am running away from him.\" \"But where is he?\" \"In pursuit of my horse.\" \"But why are you not on your horse? Did he throw you?\" \"No; I slipped off his back, and he started off in wild terror, the lion in pursuit.\" \"That probably saved your life.\" \"But how does a lion happen to be in this territory?\" asked Gerald, in curiosity. \"I never heard that lions were to be found in Montana.\" \"Nor are they. This lion belongs to a circus. He escaped only half an hour ago, and I am in pursuit of him.\" \"Are you connected with the circus?\" \"Yes. My brother and I own it. We want to recover the lion, for he cost us a large sum of money.\" \"But suppose you meet him—won\u0027t you be in danger?\" \"No. Any one else would; but I am his keeper, and he is afraid of me.\" Gerald looked at him in curiosity. He could not understand how any one could gain such power over a lion. \"In what direction did the lion go?\" Gerald pointed eastward. \"I suppose, then, there is nothing to do but wait till he comes back.\" \"I would rather not wait. You may have power over the lion, but I have not.\" \"Then you can push on to the village; I will wait here.\" \"How far is it?\" \"Rather more than a mile.\" \"But if the lion should overtake me, I should be in a bad case.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what you may do. You may take my horse, and I will stay here. Go to the hotel and say that I sent you.\" \"What name shall I use?\" \"King. I am Paul King, and I belong to King Brothers\u0027 Circus.\" \"I don\u0027t like to deprive you of your horse.\" \"It is of no consequence. If Nero comes back I can meet him just as well alone.\" \"Do you think he will come back?\" \"Aye. Look!\" he added, with excitement, \"there he is!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82369.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
