{"id":8861,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII A TRIP ON HORSEBACK","content":"Three months passed and found Gerald still in his new home. There were no striking incidents during this time, but in a quiet way Gerald had effected a good deal in the way of change and improvement. The house was provided with new comforts, a safe had been sent from Helena, in which Thomas Nixon kept securities and valuable papers, a good deal of correspondence was carried on, Gerald acting as private secretary. Meals were no longer sent in from the boarding-house, but a young Swedish woman was engaged as servant and housekeeper. In short, Mr. Nixon was beginning to live like other people. To Gerald the most important event was the purchase of a horse for his use. At that time railroad facilities hardly existed in Campville, walking was difficult and fatiguing over the rough hills of Montana; and in traveling about for his employer Gerald found a horse of great service. He at any rate was in a position to contradict the statement that Thomas Nixon was a miser, for the old man repeatedly offered him money outside of his salary, but thus far Gerald had declined with thanks. One day Gerald brought back a letter from the morning mail, which Mr. Nixon read with thoughtful interest. \"I may have to send you on a journey, Gerald,\" he said. \"All right, sir.\" \"This letter is from the superintendent of a gold mine in Ransom, seventy-five miles from here. I own a half interest in the mine. He writes me that the output for the last six months has been falling off, and that the value of the mine has greatly depreciated. He ends by offering twenty thousand dollars for my share.\" \"Why should he want to buy it if the mine is falling off so largely?\" \"That is what occurred to me. He closes by inviting me to go on and investigate for myself. He knows that I should not be likely to accept the invitation as my health is not sufficiently good.\" \"Did the superintendent offer to buy for himself?\" \"He intimated that there was a man from New York whom he could induce to buy. I presume by a misrepresentation of the paying qualities of the mine.\" \"That would be a fraud,\" said Gerald. \"Certainly, and I don\u0027t care to defraud anyone.\" \"What did you regard as the value of your half of the mine?\" \"At least thirty-five thousand dollars.\" \"Whatever I can do for you in this matter, Mr. Nixon, I shall be glad to do.\" \"I will send you to Ransom, not as representing me, but on a visit of investigation. Look about you, find out what you can, and report to me.\" \"I hope I shall be able to acquit myself to your satisfaction.\" \"At any rate, I have great confidence in you, and shall be guided by your report.\" \"Is Ransom far from here?\" \"About seventy-five miles. The way to it is across country, and at times the traveling may be rough.\" \"Oh, I can rough it,\" said Gerald, cheerfully. \"Won\u0027t the superintendent be surprised at your not answering his letter?\" \"I shall answer it. I will write that I will take his offer into consideration—that in a matter of such importance I cannot decide at once. I will also add that it is doubtful whether I can go to Ransom on account of my health, but he can write me any further information that he thinks may interest me. I will also give you a paper stating that you represent me, but that is not to be used unless it seems expedient.\" \"Yes, sir, I understand. Have you any further instructions? When do you wish me to start?\" \"As soon as you can get ready. I will make out a list of places along the route for your guidance. I would let you ask Mr. Loche for directions as to the course you are to take, but it might leak out where you had gone.\" \"I shall find the place, sir. I am a Yankee, and can ask questions.\" \"Take what money you need. I leave that to your discretion.\" \"You put great trust in me, Mr. Nixon.\" \"Well, young as you are, you are my right-hand man. Mr. Nugent could have done me no greater favor than by sending you to me.\" On the afternoon of the second day Gerald found himself riding up a rocky incline, probably fifty miles on his way. There was no other traveler in sight. This had been his experience much of the way. Through the clear atmosphere, however, he could see some scattered buildings, betokening the presence of a village three or four miles away. \"I wish some one would come along,\" thought Gerald. \"I haven\u0027t seen a face for three hours.\" Had Gerald foreseen in what way his solitude would be broken in upon, he would have hesitated to express such a wish. Ten minutes later he heard a terrible roar, and, looking up quickly, turned pale with dismay, as he noted the approach of a huge lion advancing toward him at terrific speed. He had never heard that lions were to be found in Montana, and his surprise was almost as great as his terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82368.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
