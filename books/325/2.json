{"id":8835,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II MR. TUBBS, THE GROCER","content":"Gerald was so disturbed by the communication which his stepmother had made that he walked at random, hardly knowing in what direction he was going. Before he was well aware of it, he found himself passing the grocery store in which, according to Mrs. Lane\u0027s plans, he was to find employment. Raising his eyes he saw Mr. Tubbs standing in the doorway. The grocer was a short, stout man, not over five feet four inches in height and weighing well on to two hundred pounds. His features relaxed into a smile as he recognized Gerald. \"Come here, Gerald,\" he said. Gerald paused, and as he looked into the grocery store with its sanded floor, barrels of flour, and boxes of potatoes, with the dried codfish hanging against the wall, his heart sank within him. He was not afraid of work, but to work in such a place and with such surroundings seemed to him dismal indeed. \"Then you are coming to work for me?\" said Mr. Tubbs smiling broadly. \"Hasn\u0027t your mother told you?\" \"My stepmother mentioned it this morning,\" said Gerald, gravely. \"We made the bargain last week. You\u0027ll get good pay, too. Three dollars a week. I never paid so much before, but I expect you will earn it. You look like a good, strong boy.\" \"Yes, I am strong,\" said Gerald, briefly. \"And you are willing to work, I suppose?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Mr. Tubbs. Mrs. Lane had no right to make a bargain for me. My father always intended that I should go to college.\" \"That would cost a sight of money, Gerald. Here you would learn business. In a few years you may be earning ten dollars a week.\" He spoke as if this were a very large sum. \"I am not afraid to work, Mr. Tubbs, but I don\u0027t think I shall like the grocery business.\" \"Pooh, pooh! a boy like you doesn\u0027t know what he would like. How old are you?\" \"Sixteen.\" \"Sixteen? Why, at sixteen I could lift a barrel of flour. I worked well, if I do say it myself. I only got two dollars a week in this very store, and now it\u0027s my own.\" He looked around him with an air of pride. His highest ambition was realized in the possession of a grocery store. \"What do you say to that?\" \"You have done well, Mr. Tubbs.\" \"Haven\u0027t I? And you can do as well. Why, in five years if your mother will advance a little money, I may give you an interest in the business.\" Gerald did not reply. His heart was sore, and he felt that life had few attractions for him if it was to be passed here. \"Are you going to school now?\" \"I have been.\" \"Your mother told me you might come here a week from Monday, but I\u0027d like to have you come a week earlier, if you can as well as not.\" \"No, I will wait,\" said Gerald, hastily. \"Well, just as you like, but if you\u0027ll come in evenings so as to get a little used to the work, I\u0027ll give you—say, seventy-five cents for a week.\" \"I think you will have to excuse me, Mr. Tubbs.\" \"Oh, well, I won\u0027t insist upon it,\" said the grocer, half dissatisfied. It was Saturday, the weekly school holiday. To-day, at least, Gerald was free. He decided to walk to Crescent Pond and go out in his boat. He had a small dory there, which his father had given him on his last birthday. On the way he passed a small cottage belonging to his father\u0027s estate. It was tenanted by a widow named Holman. Her son, John, had been one of his schoolmates but was now employed in a shoe shop. John was sitting on a wheelbarrow in the yard. \"Come and have a row, John,\" said Gerald, \"that is, if you are not working to-day.\" \"No, the shop is shut down for a fortnight,\" said John, soberly. \"It is likely to be a bad job for us.\" \"How is that?\" \"Our rent was due yesterday, and we can\u0027t pay it.\" \"But this is one of father\u0027s houses.\" \"Yes; if your father was alive there would be no trouble.\" \"Have you had any notice to pay?\" asked Gerald, quickly. \"Your stepmother says that if the rent is not paid on Monday we must turn out.\" \"Surely she would not be so inhuman.\" \"That is exactly what she said when mother went to the house yesterday afternoon. My being out of work made no difference to her. I wish the house was yours, Gerald.\" \"Nothing seems to be mine, John,\" said Gerald, gravely. \"Mrs. Lane told me this morning that I must leave school and go to work.\" \"What a shame! How could your father leave you in the power of such a woman?\" \"I can\u0027t tell, John. That is what puzzles me. But how much is the rent?\" \"Six dollars.\" \"Have you got anything toward it?\" \"No. What money we have must go toward food.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I have some money in the savings bank. I\u0027ll go and draw out six dollars and lend it to you, but you mustn\u0027t let Mrs. Lane know where it came from.\" \"You are awfully kind, Gerald; but I don\u0027t think we ought to accept your offer.\" \"Why not? The money is mine.\" \"Your stepmother might object.\" \"I don\u0027t think she knows that I have any money in the bank; besides, it has always been mine to do what I pleased with. Father never interfered with it at any time.\" \"Still, as you have no money left to you, you may need it.\" Gerald admitted to himself that this might very probably be true, but he felt that Mrs. Holman needed the money more than he did. \"We won\u0027t worry about the future,\" he said. \"At present you need the money and I don\u0027t.\" \"I am afraid I shall have to accept the money for mother\u0027s sake.\" \"That is right, John; come with me and I\u0027ll get it out.\" The savings bank was a small building on the main street. It was scarcely a quarter of a mile distant, and the two boys were soon inside. Gerald made out a check at a small table near the door and presented it to the paying teller. Gerald was a favorite with the bank officer, who said to him jocosely: \"What are you drawing this money for? Are you going to get married?\" \"Not just yet, Mr. Barton, I am afraid my account isn\u0027t large enough for that.\" \"It wouldn\u0027t last long, I am afraid, if you wanted it for that purpose. How will you have it?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. A five and a one will do.\" \"Here it is.\" Gerald took the bills and went out into the street. \"Here, John, take the money,\" he said, \"I am glad it will help you.\" \"It will relieve us very much. Mother has been worrying a good deal over our trouble. She didn\u0027t know where to go.\" Now it happened that Mrs. Lane, who was walking on the opposite side of the street, saw the two boys coming out of the bank. Her curiosity was aroused, and unseen by Gerald, she crossed over and entered the savings bank. \"Mr. Barton,\" she said, \"didn\u0027t I see Gerald come out of the bank just now with the Holman boy?\" \"Yes, Mrs. Lane.\" \"What did he come in for?\" Mr. Barton had never liked Mrs. Lane, and he wasn\u0027t pleased with her somewhat peremptory tone. \"He came on business connected with the bank,\" he said briefly. \"Oh, he did, did he? What business can he have here?\" \"You had better ask him.\" Mrs. Lane was provoked, but she saw that she could not browbeat the bank officer. \"Mr. Barton,\" she said, \"has Gerald any money in this bank?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did he draw any this morning?\" \"Yes.\" \"How much?\" \"I don\u0027t answer such questions in regard to our depositors.\" \"Has he any left here?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then don\u0027t let him draw any more out—do you hear?—without communicating with me.\" \"Mrs. Lane, this deposit is in Gerald\u0027s name and has always been under his control. His father never interfered with it, nor have you any right to do so.\" \"Gerald Lane is my stepson. It is my duty to see that he doesn\u0027t waste his money, do you hear?\" \"Whenever Gerald presents a draft, I shall honor it, do you hear?\" retorted the cashier. Mrs. Lane\u0027s face became red with anger. \"You are very impolite,\" she said. \"So are you, Mrs. Lane. You did not even know that Gerald had an account here, and as his father did not interfere with it, I fail to see why you should. Good morning, madam!\" Mrs. Lane left the bank in a passion. She was not used to being thwarted and she would have had Mr. Barton discharged from his post if she could have had her way. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82342.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
