{"id":8867,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV A DEED OF GIFT","content":"Within two weeks Joshua Burdoch had bought Mr. Nixon\u0027s share of the mine at Ransom for forty thousand dollars. Mr. Hawk\u0027s share he secured for thirty thousand. He then made a formal proposal to Gerald to go to work for him as assistant manager. But to this Mr. Nixon demurred. \"I can\u0027t spare Gerald, Mr. Burdoch,\" he said. \"But, Mr. Nixon, think of the boy\u0027s interests. I am willing to pay him a salary of a hundred dollars a month.\" \"And I,\" said the old man, \"will give him outright ten thousand dollars—one-fourth of the sum you have paid me for my interest in the mine.\" \"Give me your hand, Mr. Nixon,\" said Burdoch, \"I can\u0027t go ahead of that. He is a good boy, and he deserves his good fortune.\" Gerald was overwhelmed by his liberality. \"How can I thank you, Mr. Nixon,\" he said, \"for your generosity?\" \"It isn\u0027t generosity. It\u0027s only justice. But for you I doubt if I should be living to-day. You have taught me how to live. And now let me tell you something. I have sent on to Mr. Nugent the amount I took from his firm many years ago. He refused to accept interest, but wrote that I might make up to you whatever it amounted to. It amounts to more than the ten thousand dollars I have given you, but that I will account for later.\" \"I cannot realize my good fortune, Mr. Nixon. You and Mr. Nugent have been very kind to me.\" \"Are you tired of living in Montana?\" \"I don\u0027t like it as well as living in my old home.\" \"Nor do I. With your help I propose to settle up my affairs, convert what property I have here into money, and go back to the East.\" \"I am very glad to hear you say so, Mr. Nixon.\" \"It will probably require six months. Then we will start. But you must stay with me there. I have no relations that I care for. I consider you my adopted son, and will see that you are provided for.\" Steps were immediately taken to settle up Mr. Nixon\u0027s estate. To anticipate matters a little, it was found, after this was effected, that he possessed close upon seventy-five thousand dollars, though he had paid up the sum of his defalcation and made Gerald a gift of ten thousand dollars. At length the time came when Mr. Nixon was ready to start for the East. The old man brightened up with anticipation. \"Gerald,\" he said, \"I feel ten years younger. I really begin to think that I shall live a few years longer.\" \"I am sure you will, Mr. Nixon.\" \"How much I owe you! I little thought when you came to me, a mere boy, that you would do me so much good. John Nugent knew what he was about when he selected you as his messenger. How long is it since you came to me?\" \"It must be nearly a year and a half.\" \"I should have been in my grave before this if you had not come. Do you ever hear from your stepmother?\" \"I have not heard from her.\" \"She is still at Portville?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"You won\u0027t leave me and go to live with her?\" \"There is no danger of that,\" answered Gerald. Mr. Nixon breathed a sigh of relief. \"Stay with the old man till he dies!\" he pleaded. \"You won\u0027t be sorry.\" \"I will, Mr. Nixon.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82374.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
