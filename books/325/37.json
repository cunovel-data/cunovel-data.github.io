They called at once on Mr. Nugent, who received the old man kindly and cordially. \"Mr. Nugent,\" said Tom Nixon, \"I have come prepared to pay you the interest on the amount of my defalcation.\" \"Give it to Gerald. I don\u0027t want it.\" \"I have already given Gerald ten thousand dollars, and when I die he will have all that I leave behind me.\" Mr. Nugent looked much pleased. He grasped the hand of his old debtor cordially, and said: \"I am pleased to hear it. Then you found Gerald of assistance to you?\" \"But for him I should not have been living to-day. He has done everything for me.\" \"Probably you wondered at my choice of a messenger at first?\" \"Yes. It seemed strange to me that you should select a young boy, but I soon found that he had the sense and discretion of a man.\" \"Have you seen your stepmother yet, Gerald?\" asked Mr. Nugent. \"No; but I met Abel on the street.\" \"What did he have to say?\" \"He asked me if I had any money.\" \"What did you reply?\" \"\u0027A little.\u0027 Then he said, \u0027If you expect to live on ma you will find yourself much mistaken.

It was placed in my hands by your father, with directions not to produce it if Mrs. Lane treated you fairly. Otherwise, I was to make it known. By this will you are left half the property. That will only amount to ten thousand dollars, as Mrs. Lane has been compelled to surrender thirty thousand dollars to John Graves. She will be left comparatively poor.\" \"Mr. Nugent,\" said Gerald, \"am I compelled to take advantage of this will?\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"Because, thanks to Mr. Nixon\u0027s generosity, I do not need it. I feel rich already. I am willing to surrender all claims upon my father\u0027s estate.\" \"Your stepmother does not deserve it.\" \"Let the boy have his way,\" said Thomas Nixon, \"I prefer to provide for him myself.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82377.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
