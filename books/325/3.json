{"id":8836,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III MRS. LANE\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT","content":"Half an hour later the two boys were passing the savings bank, when Mr. Barton espied them. Leaving his place, he went to the door and called them. \"I have a word to say to you, Gerald,\" he said. \"Does your stepmother know that you have a deposit in our bank?\" \"Not that I know of. It is nothing to her, anyway, as my father put the money here under my name, and it was left to my control.\" \"Precisely; but I have to tell you that Mrs. Lane does know you have money here.\" \"How did she find out?\" asked Gerald, amazed. \"She saw you go out of the bank and, suspecting something, came in and inquired.\" \"Well?\" \"Of course I told her that you had an account here. Then she forbade me to let you draw any of it.\" \"And you agreed to it?\" \"No, I told her the money was under your control.\" \"Thank you. What did she say then?\" \"She asked how much money you had here; I declined to inform her.\" \"Mr. Barton, you are a true friend.\" \"I don\u0027t mind telling you, Gerald, that I don\u0027t like your stepmother, and that I do like you.\" \"I am afraid there will be trouble. What do you advise me to do?\" \"To draw out all your money except one dollar. Our rules will admit of that.\" \"But what shall I do with it? If I keep it at home she may get hold of it.\" \"Put it in the hands of some friend you can trust.\" \"Will you take charge of it for me?\" \"Yes, Gerald, if you think you can trust me,\" said Mr. Barton, with a smile. \"There is no one I would trust with more confidence.\" \"Then draw a check for forty-three dollars. That, together with the six dollars you have already drawn, will leave one dollar in the bank.\" \"Good! I will do it.\" Gerald made out a check for forty-three dollars, and, when received, handed the money to Mr. Barton, who gave him a memorandum of it. \"Keep this from your stepmother,\" he suggested, \"or she will ask me for it.\" \"Won\u0027t you keep the memorandum yourself, Mr. Barton?\" \"But that would be hardly businesslike.\" \"Never mind that. I have perfect confidence in you.\" \"Very well, since you have confidence in me, I will put it in my tin box at home, and if anything should happen to me it will secure you.\" \"Well, I am glad that is off my mind,\" said Gerald; \"I think I have checkmated Mrs. Lane.\" \"It must be disagreeable to find it necessary to take such extreme precautions.\" \"It is, but I must submit to it.\" \"You told me you were going to work, Gerald,\" said John, suddenly. \"Have you engaged any place?\" \"No, but Mrs. Lane has made an arrangement for me with Mr. Tubbs, the grocer.\" \"You don\u0027t mean it? You work in a grocery!\" \"It is respectable, and I am not afraid of work, but it will be very disagreeable.\" \"I can tell you it will be. I once worked for old Tubbs myself.\" \"How did you like it?\" \"Not at all. I had to work twelve hours a day, and received but two dollars and a half a week.\" \"I am to have the munificent sum of three dollars. Evidently Mr. Tubbs thinks that very liberal. He tells me that by the time I am twenty-one I may be getting ten dollars a week, and if my stepmother will advance a thousand dollars he may sell me an interest in the business.\" \"What a shame!\" \"That I should have an interest in the business?\" asked Gerald, with a smile. \"No, but that a boy of your scholarship should tend in a grocery, and for such a sum. Why, I earn six dollars a week as a pegger.\" \"I should rather work in your shop than in the grocery.\" \"But there is no vacancy. That, too, would be unfit for you. Why, you know Latin and French, don\u0027t you?\" \"I have studied them. If Mr. Tubbs has any Latin or French customers I may be able to wait on them.\" \"I am glad you can joke about it, Gerald.\" \"I don\u0027t feel much like joking, I assure you.\" About twelve o\u0027clock Gerald turned his steps in the direction of home, though, since his father\u0027s death, it no longer seemed to him like home. Dinner would be on the table at half-past twelve, and he always aimed to be punctual. Mrs. Lane took her place at the table, stiff and rigid as usual. She had not forgotten the savings bank deposit of Gerald, and had made up her mind to get it under her control. Mrs. Lane did not immediately introduce the subject, but when the dessert came on she said: \"I saw you coming out of the savings bank this morning.\" \"Now for it!\" thought Gerald. \"Yes,\" he said, in brief assent. \"How long have you had an account there?\" \"About two years.\" \"Did you withdraw any money this morning?\" \"Yes.\" \"How much?\" \"You must excuse me, Mrs. Lane, but that is my own private business.\" \"You are quite mistaken. You are my stepson, and you are under my guardianship.\" \"I suppose, then, you have charge of my property. Let me know how much it is.\" Mrs. Lane winced. \"You have no property,\" she said, coldly, \"except what money you may have in the savings bank.\" \"Then I am to understand that none of the property belonging to my father comes to me.\" \"You will receive a certain advantage from it. Your home is in this house, and the dinner you are eating is provided with your father\u0027s money.\" \"Yet you want me to pay you half the money I am to receive for work!\" \"Yes; but if you are guided by my wishes, I shall lay it aside for you, to be given to you hereafter.\" \"I am not prepared to say that I shall be guided by your wishes.\" \"Do you positively refuse to tell me how much money you have in the savings bank?\" \"I do.\" \"I require you to give me your bank-book. It is proper that I should keep it.\" Gerald expected this. \"Mrs. Lane, ever since I had any money in the bank, the book has been in my possession. My father desired me to keep it.\" \"Your father was foolishly indulgent.\" \"I don\u0027t think you are likely to be. Perhaps you will tell me what you want of the book?\" \"I want to prevent your withdrawing any more money.\" \"So I supposed, and that is the reason why I decline to give you the book.\" \"Very well; we will drop the subject for the present. I trust that with time for reflection you will take a different view of your duty.\" Gerald was surprised at his stepmother\u0027s change of front. \"She wants to put me off my guard,\" he decided. \"She will search my room for the book.\" As there was but a dollar to his credit now, this didn\u0027t disturb him particularly, nor did it prevent his going to his chamber and putting the book into his trunk. \"I should like to be here when she finds it,\" he said to himself. Gerald had promised to go out on the pond in his boat, and John had agreed to go with him. He stopped at his friend\u0027s house on the way, and John joined him. Meanwhile Mrs. Lane waited till Gerald was safely distant, and then with a look of expectation, ascended the staircase to his room. She had noticed that her stepson went up-stairs, and thought it probable that he had put the book away. Gerald\u0027s trunk was in one corner of the room. It was locked, but this did not interpose any obstacle. Mrs. Lane kneeled down in front of it and took from her pocket a bunch of keys. She did not immediately find one that fitted the lock, but presently the right key turned up. \"Ha!\" she said, triumphantly, as the key turned in the lock and the lid was raised. \"Now, Master Gerald, we will see how much money you have to your credit.\" The bank-book was just below the tray, and no time was wasted in finding it. She opened the book eagerly, and scanned the entries. But her first elation was succeeded by a look of anger and disappointment. Fifty dollars was entered to Gerald\u0027s credit, but his drafts amounted to forty-nine. There was only one dollar left. \"Two drafts this morning!\" said Mrs. Lane, angrily. \"What has he done with the money?\" She searched the trunk carefully, hoping to find somewhere a roll of bills, but as we know, she was doomed to disappointment. \"He is sly,\" she muttered; \"but I will trap him yet.\" She left the book in the tray, whereas it had been placed underneath. When Gerald opened his trunk, he discovered the change, and knew that his trunk had been opened and examined by his stepmother. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82343.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
