{"id":8847,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV A CRISIS","content":"At this moment Brandon entered the store. He took in at a glance what was going on. He noticed Gerald\u0027s flushed face and he smiled inwardly. \"I reckon the kid finds himself in hot water,\" he said to himself. \"Come here, Mr. Brandon,\" said the grocer. \"Yes, sir,\" returned Brandon, innocently. \"Do you remember telling me that you saw Gerald take money from the drawer?\" \"Yes, sir; I thought it my duty to tell you. At the same time, as it is probably a first offence, I hope you will forgive him.\" \"You see how considerate Brandon is,\" said Mr. Tubbs, turning to Gerald. \"What do you think the boy says?\" This was, of course, addressed to Brandon. \"I don\u0027t know, sir. Does he deny taking the money?\" \"Yes. He says he saw you take it!\" \"Is it possible?\" exclaimed Brandon. \"I hope you don\u0027t believe the charge, Mr. Tubbs.\" \"Certainly not.\" \"You may search me if you like.\" \"Perhaps it will be well to search you both, though, of course, the note may have been spent.\" \"I am at your command, Mr. Tubbs. Stay, I will turn my pockets inside out!\" He proceeded to do so, but only a few silver coins were found. The fact was that the note had been paid away in the billiard-room the previous evening. \"Now, Gerald, it is your turn.\" Gerald looked embarrassed. Though he was perfectly innocent, he knew that there was a five-dollar bill in his pocketbook—part of the money drawn from the savings bank. Mr. Barton had handed it to him only two days previous. Brandon had no knowledge of this. His only idea was to subject Gerald to humiliation. But when he saw the boy\u0027s confusion, he began to think that things were turning out unexpectedly in his favor. \"I don\u0027t think he wants to be searched, Mr. Tubbs,\" he said, pointedly. \"I am willing to follow the example of Mr. Brandon,\" said Gerald. He took out his pocketbook and handed it to the grocer. The latter opened it, and drew out a five-dollar bill. \"Ha!\" he exclaimed, in excitement, as he held it up to view. \"This tells the story, Gerald Lane! You are a thief!\" \"That\u0027s false, Mr. Tubbs!\" said Gerald, hotly. \"That bill is mine.\" \"That\u0027s a likely story. Of course a boy that will steal will lie.\" \"It is true,\" said Gerald, firmly. \"Then where did you get this money?\" demanded the grocer, sternly. \"From Mr. Barton, in the savings bank.\" \"Gerald Lane, you may think I am an idiot, but you are mistaken. I will keep this bill.\" \"Then it is you who are the thief. You can ask Mr. Barton if I do not tell the truth.\" Brandon smiled gleefully. He was very much surprised to learn that Gerald had a five-dollar bill in his possession. He knew, of course, that it was not the bill taken from the drawer; but the grocer did not know, and he saw that it would clear him from suspicion. \"What do you think of this boy, Brandon?\" asked Mr. Tubbs. \"I think he yielded to temptation, and that he won\u0027t do it again. Will you do me a favor, Mr. Tubbs, and overlook his offense?\" \"You are very kind to him, Brandon, especially when he has charged you with robbing the money-drawer; but I cannot retain a thief in my employ.\" \"I don\u0027t wish you to keep me at Mr. Brandon\u0027s request,\" said Gerald, with spirit. \"I do not take back my charge against him.\" \"Then, Mr. Tubbs,\" said Brandon, \"I have no more to say,\" and he moved to another part of the store. Things certainly looked dark for Gerald. The circumstantial evidence against him was of a serious and convincing character. But there was an unexpected witness in his favor just entering the store. It was Mr. Barton. Gerald\u0027s face lighted up when he saw the entrance of his friend. So did that of Mr. Tubbs. \"Now I shall be able to show that you were lying,\" said the grocer, triumphantly. \"What is the matter?\" asked the bank teller, turning from one to the other. \"Mr. Barton,\" said the grocer, \"you come just in good time; This boy has robbed me of a five-dollar bill.\" \"Impossible!\" exclaimed the bank teller. \"Gerald Lane is an honest boy.\" \"So I thought myself; but you are liable to be deceived in boys. Mr. Brandon saw him take the bill from the drawer, and told me. I have searched him and found the bill in his possession. Now he has the assurance to say that he got the bill from you.\" \"Probably he did.\" \"What!\" ejaculated the grocer, starting back in amazement. \"It is true. I gave Gerald a five-dollar bill.\" \"That is just what I told you, Mr. Tubbs,\" said Gerald, triumphantly. \"But,\" said the grocer, \"Brandon says he saw him take a bill from the drawer, and I miss a five-dollar note.\" \"Then all I can say is that Mr. Brandon has probably told you what is not true.\" \"Sir!\" exclaimed Brandon, nervously. \"I mean what I say,\" said Mr. Barton, sternly. \"I know Gerald Lane, and I would trust him implicitly.\" \"But a bill has been taken from my drawer,\" said the grocer. \"I am sure Gerald did not take it.\" \"Mr. Tubbs, I will thank you to give me back my money,\" said Gerald. \"I don\u0027t know that I ought to do it, after what I have heard about you,\" said Mr. Tubbs, hesitating. \"The bill could not have gone away by itself.\" \"That is true enough, but I am not the only one employed in the store.\" The grocer was badly confused. He had decided beyond a doubt that Gerald was a thief; but then Mr. Barton vouched for him, and Mr. Barton was a man of consideration. He gave back the bill to Gerald, but with reluctance. \"It seems, then,\" he said, \"that I am to bear the loss.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Barton, \"unless you discover who took your money.\" \"I shall feel uncomfortable to think I have a thief in the store.\" \"So far as I am concerned,\" Gerald said, proudly, \"you will have no trouble. I resign my position.\" \"I guess you\u0027d better stay till the end of the week,\" said Mr. Tubbs. \"I can\u0027t fill your place right off.\" \"I will do so to oblige you. If another such charge is brought against me I shall leave you at once.\" Here Mr. Barton made his purchase. As he left the store he said: \"Call and see me, Gerald; we can talk this matter over.\" When the bank officer had left the store Mr. Tubbs said: \"There seems to be a great mystery about this robbery.\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Brandon. \"Mr. Barton seems to vouch for Gerald.\" \"He is a good man, but not very sharp. He is surely taken in.\" That evening when Gerald went home he said to his stepmother: \"Mrs. Lane, I have something to tell you.\" \"Well?\" she responded, coldly. \"I am going to leave the grocery store,\" Gerald announced quietly. \"What? without my permission?\" she demanded, in displeasure. \"Yes, Mrs. Lane.\" \"What\u0027s your reason? Are you getting lazy? Are you tired of work?\" \"No.\" \"Then let me know the cause of your determination. Not that I shall consent to it.\" \"Mr. Tubbs charged me with taking money from the drawer.\" \"Oh-o!\" said Abel. \"So that\u0027s what you have been up to. I suppose he has bounced you!\" \"Of course no one will believe it that knows me,\" returned Gerald, contemptuously. \"I\u0027m not so sure of that.\" \"If your mother were not here I would give you a thrashing!\" said Gerald, hotly. \"Ma wouldn\u0027t let you.\" \"All this is very discreditable, Gerald,\" said his stepmother. \"I certainly did not think that you would descend to theft. Mr. Tubbs might have had you arrested.\" \"I found a friend to speak up for me—Mr. Barton.\" \"Has Mr. Tubbs discharged you, or is he willing to keep you?\" \"I presume he is.\" \"Then you will go back,\" said Mrs. Lane, decisively. \"I shall remain till the end of the week to oblige Mr. Tubbs, but I will stay no longer.\" \"We will see about that. Now it is time to go to bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82354.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
