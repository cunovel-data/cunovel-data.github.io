{"id":8856,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII NEW ARRANGEMENTS","content":"Gerald remained after the others left the cabin. The old man looked at him inquiringly. \"I don\u0027t think I know you,\" he said. \"Do you live in the village?\" \"No, sir. I was sent here from the East.\" Thomas Nixon looked puzzled. \"Are you going to school?\" \"No, sir. I was sent here to see you.\" \"To see me? I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Do you remember writing a letter to Mr. John Nugent, of Portville?\" \"Yes; but surely——\" \"I have a copy of your letter here, which I will show you. You wished Mr. Nugent to send a messenger to represent him and assist you in any way you might desire.\" \"But,\" exclaimed the old man, in astonishment, \"I didn\u0027t expect him to send a boy.\" \"This letter will explain to you why he sent me.\" \"Read it to me. I cannot see without my glasses.\" Gerald drew the letter from the envelope, and read as follows: \"Mr. Nixon, \"I need not say that I was surprised to receive your letter. I supposed you dead long ago. I am glad to hear that you are alive, and are in such a creditable state of mind. When you appropriated our funds, you injured yourself more than you did us. I am sure you have regretted it many times. \"I cannot go out to see you as I would if I were younger and stronger, for I am getting to be an old man, and I am feeble, besides being a victim of rheumatism. As to sending a messenger, I was at first greatly in doubt whom I could select. Finally I fixed upon Gerald Lane, whose late father I knew well. He is only a boy, but he possesses as much good judgment as many men ten years older. Besides, he is thoroughly honest and reliable. I place him at your service, with full power to act for me, and I will pay his expenses. When you know him as well as I do, you will learn to trust him as much as I do. \"I remain, with sincere good wishes, \"Your old friend, \"John Nugent.\" Gerald was gratified in reading the terms used in speaking of him. Mr. Nixon listened intently. \"That is a good letter, and gives me great pleasure!\" he said. \"I am glad that John Nugent forgives me the injury I did him.\" \"Yes, he told me that he freely forgave you.\" \"But still,\" said the old man, \"it seems strange to me that a boy of your age—— How old are you?\" \"Sixteen.\" \"That a boy of sixteen should be so trusted.\" \"I am surprised, too, Mr. Nixon,\" said Gerald, frankly. \"I hope I shall be found to deserve all that Mr. Nugent says of me. He is a fine man, and has been a good friend to me.\" \"He is an excellent man,\" said Mr. Nixon, with emphasis. \"I like you, too, and I feel confident that you deserve what he says of you.\" \"I hope so, Mr. Nixon, and I want to be of service to you. Will you let me offer a suggestion?\" \"By all means.\" \"Then don\u0027t you think it is unwise to keep your gold so exposed? I wonder you have not been robbed before.\" \"That is true. I have been imprudent. But I have been so miserably sick, I was unable to make any other arrangements. Now that you are here, I will think what I can do.\" \"Is there no bank where you could store it?\" \"Yes, there is one ten miles away, in Fairfield, but I am not able to go there.\" \"Send me, then. You will want to keep some of the gold by you for use.\" \"I use very little money,\" said the old man, shaking his head. \"I hope you will use more. You are getting old, and you ought to be more comfortably situated. As I read the letter you sent to Mr. Nugent I know that you are abundantly able to live better than you do.\" \"You are right. Heretofore I have had no ambitions and no object in life, but since I am assured of John Nugent\u0027s forgiveness I feel that a burden had been lifted from my soul. You are so young, you won\u0027t get tired of staying with the old man?\" \"No, Mr. Nixon. Not only for Mr. Nugent\u0027s sake, but for your sake, I will gladly remain with you and do what I can.\" \"Thank you. It puts new life into me to know that I have a young companion who will help me, and do for me what I cannot do for myself. You came at the right time.\" \"Yes, I was startled when I opened the cabin door to see that man in the act of robbing you. Is he really your nephew?\" \"Dear knows, I don\u0027t! I never saw him before. Whatever he is I don\u0027t care to recognize him as a relative.\" \"I don\u0027t think he will ever trouble you again. The men who carried him away will give him a good fright, at any rate. Now, Mr. Nixon, where do you think it best that I should stay? I need to be near you to take care of you.\" The old man looked puzzled. He looked about him at the contracted accommodations of the cabin, and hesitated. \"I am afraid you would not like staying here,\" he said, after awhile. \"Not for any length of time, Mr. Nixon. If you won\u0027t be offended, I will ask you why you stay here yourself?\" \"I have lived here ever since I came to Campville,\" he answered. \"And how long is that?\" \"Fifteen years.\" \"Did you build the cabin?\" \"No. It had just been vacated by the original owner and builder.\" \"You ought to have a more comfortable home.\" \"Yes, I suppose so,\" said Thomas Nixon; \"but I don\u0027t know where to go.\" \"Will you authorize me to find you a place, Mr. Nixon?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I will go out at once and see what I can find. You should not stay here another night.\" \"Come back soon,\" said the old man. He had already come to value the company of his young companion, and felt that he should miss him, even for a short time. Gerald took his hat and went out. He bent his steps toward the store of Joe Loche, feeling that he should there be more likely to obtain the information of which he was in search. He had already called there, like Ralph Nixon, to inquire the way to the cabin of the old man. \"Mr. Loche,\" he said, proceeding at once to business, \"is there any comfortable house vacant in the village?\" \"Yes,\" answered the storekeeper. \"There is a four-room house, which was occupied yesterday but is vacant to-day.\" \"Who owns it?\" \"I do. I bought it, furniture and all, from Jim Morris, who has made his pile, and is going back to his old home in New Hampshire.\" \"Are you willing to sell or let it?\" \"Either one. Are you going to get married and settle down among us?\" \"Not quite yet,\" answered Gerald, with a laugh. \"I have been sent from the East to Mr. Nixon, and I shall stay with him for a while. He has authorized me to look him up a more suitable home.\" \"I am glad to hear it. That old tumble-down shanty isn\u0027t fit for the old man to live in.\" \"Would you mind showing me the house?\" \"I shall be glad to do so. Here, Dennis, just look after business, and I will go over to Jim\u0027s house with this young man.\" Gerald found the house better furnished than he had anticipated. Jim Morris had a wife and young family, and had provided them a comfortable home. The house seemed completely furnished, even to crockery and kitchen furniture. Gerald was much pleased. \"I will recommend Mr. Nixon to hire it, and after a while I hope he will buy it. Can he move in to-night?\" \"Sure.\" \"Then I will take it. I am sure Mr. Nixon will do what I advise.\" \"You don\u0027t ask what I shall charge!\" \"No, Mr. Loche, because I know you will only ask a fair price; and, besides, there is no other house I can get.\" \"That is true. Well, it will be all right about the terms.\" \"One thing more. Have you a wagon in which you can bring Mr. Nixon over? He is too feeble to walk.\" \"I\u0027ll send at once. My assistant, Dennis Carlyle, will harness up and go back with you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Loche.\" \"I say, boy, you seem to be a pretty smart kid. So you are going to look after the old man?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then he\u0027s in luck. You have begun well.\" \"What was done with the man who tried to rob him?\" \"He got an everlasting thrashing. We made him run the gauntlet, and he was pretty sore when he crept away. We thought at first of hanging him!\" \"I am glad you didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t think he will trouble his uncle again.\" \"No, he won\u0027t come within fifty miles of Campville again as long as he lives.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82363.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
