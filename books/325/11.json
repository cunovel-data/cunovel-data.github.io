{"id":8844,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI THE BURGLAR\u0027S DEFEAT","content":"Gerald did not pause to notice that the intruder was a man much larger than himself. He had plenty of courage, and lost sight of prudence. He sprang forward and seized the burglar. The latter, turning at this unexpected attack, threw him off. He was alarmed at first, but when he saw that his assailant was only a boy he laughed harshly. \"Why, you little bantam!\" he exclaimed, \"how dare you interfere with me?\" \"You had better leave the room at once,\" said Gerald, undaunted. \"If you don\u0027t——\" \"Well, if I don\u0027t!\" repeated the intruder, mockingly. \"You\u0027ll make me, perhaps? Clear out of my way! Have you got a watch or money about your clothes?\" This last was addressed to Abel. \"Don\u0027t kill me, Mr. Burglar!\" wailed Abel, ready to cry. \"I\u0027ll give you all I have.\" \"Then be quick about it! Where are your clothes?\" \"In the closet.\" \"Then get them, and don\u0027t waste any time about it.\" \"Don\u0027t do anything of the sort, Abel!\" said Gerald. \"This man shall not rob you!\" \"Why, you impudent young rascal!\" exclaimed the intruder, fiercely. \"I have a great mind to wring your neck!\" \"I tell you once more to leave the house!\" This was too much for the irascible burglar. He seized Gerald, and, throwing him down, pressed his knee on his breast. Gerald struggled as well as he could, but he was only a boy, and his assailant was a strong man. What harm would have been done to him cannot be known. Abel, so far from helping him, stood by, trembling. Finally, in a paroxysm of fear, he ran from the room and locked himself in the small room which had been occupied by Gerald. \"Now what shall I do to you?\" demanded the burglar between his closed teeth, glaring at his prostrate victim. Gerald was not called upon to reply, for there was help at hand. A tall, muscular figure, arrayed in night-costume, suddenly dashed into the room, seized the triumphant burglar, and, pulling him back with irresistible strength, threw him upon the floor with such force that he thought his back was broken. \"What——!\" ejaculated the ruffian, in mingled surprise and dismay. Looking up he saw the blacksmith bending over him. \"What are you doing, you scoundrel?\" he cried, apparently preparing for a second attack. \"Who are you?\" growled the intruder. \"I\u0027m not a boy, and I\u0027m more than a match for you!\" \"Let me go!\" said the other, beginning to find a retreat advisable. \"Not till I see who you are. Gerald, light the lamp; I want to take a look at this man\u0027s face.\" The burglar struggled to rise, but he was as helpless in the grasp of the stalwart blacksmith as Gerald had been in his. Gerald lighted the lamp and held it near the ill-favored countenance of the visitor. \"Aha, I know you!\" said Alonzo Crane. \"You are the man who broke into a store in Hillsdale last week. You got away from us then, but now I mean to have a settlement with you.\" \"Let me go this time and I won\u0027t take anything.\" \"I don\u0027t think you will. As long as I am round you\u0027d find it a hard job to rob this house. You thought you had only boys to deal with, but I\u0027m too large a boy for you to handle.\" \"If you don\u0027t let me go I\u0027ll fix you some day.\" \"That\u0027ll be day after to-morrow, I reckon. Gerald, do you know where there is a clothes-line?\" \"Yes, Mr. Crane.\" \"Then get it, and I\u0027ll bind this man so that he can\u0027t do any more harm.\" Gerald took the lamp, went down-stairs, and soon returned with the clothes-line. \"Now, if you\u0027ll help me, I\u0027ll tie this fellow so he can\u0027t do any mischief.\" Despite his desperate struggles the intruder was bound hand and foot. He almost foamed at the mouth in his ungovernable anger, but it did no good. \"Now,\" said the blacksmith, \"I am going to put him in the closet and lock the door. If you don\u0027t mind, Gerald, I\u0027ll exchange rooms with you. I will sleep here, and you can go up to my room in the attic. I think, my friend, you\u0027ll be safe till morning.\" \"This is Abel\u0027s room, Mr. Crane.\" \"And where is Abel?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I think he went into the next room.\" \"Let him stay there! He is about as brave as a mouse. And hark you, Gerald, bring down my clothes. I have a revolver in my pocket that I may have occasion to use.\" The ruffian was thoroughly cowed, and made no outcry when he was thrust into the closet. It was remarkable that Mrs. Lane should have slept through all this disturbance without awaking, but she was a sound sleeper. In the morning Gerald went out to summon assistance, and the burglar was conveyed to the lock-up, from which he was in the afternoon transferred to the county jail. It appears that he had gained admittance to the house by climbing the lightning-rod to a balcony just outside the window of the large room occupied by Abel. The latter was so thoroughly frightened by the events of the night that he voluntarily proposed to return to the small bedroom, and Gerald was able again to occupy his own room. Mrs. Lane protested against the change, but Abel declared with emphasis that he would not again sleep in the large room. \"I wouldn\u0027t do it for a dollar a night!\" he declared. Gerald acquiesced in the new arrangement, and felt grateful to the burglar for having been the means of restoring to him his own room. A little later than he anticipated Mr. Crane left Portville. \"Good-by, Melindy,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve enjoyed my visit, and the burglar made it more lively than I anticipated. When are you coming to Hillsdale to see us?\" \"It is hard for me to get away, Alonzo. I have two boys to look after and I cannot well be spared.\" \"Come whenever it is convenient, then. I can\u0027t promise to make your visit as lively as mine has been, unless my friend the burglar manages to escape from jail.\" \"I will go with you to the cars, Mr. Crane,\" said Gerald. \"I wish you would,\" said the blacksmith, warmly. \"If you ever find it in your way to come to Hillsdale, I will give you the best room in the house.\" \"Shall I bring Abel with me?\" asked Gerald, smiling. \"I\u0027m not at all particular about seein\u0027 him. You seem a good deal nearer to me than he does, even if he is a blood relation. When do you go to work?\" \"On Monday.\" \"You won\u0027t stay in the grocery long—I\u0027ll predict that. If you ever have a notion of becomin\u0027 a blacksmith, I\u0027ll take you into my employ, and be glad to do it.\" \"I\u0027ll bear it in mind, Mr. Crane.\" When the train had started and his new friend was fairly on his way home, Gerald could not help thinking soberly of his own unpromising future. If Mrs. Lane had been more like her brother, rough and uneducated as he was, he felt that he could like her better. He at least had a good heart. On his way home he met Mr. Nugent. \"Good morning, Gerald,\" said the old gentleman, in a friendly tone. \"Have you had any more exciting experiences?\" \"Yes, sir. Last night our house was entered by a burglar.\" \"Indeed! That is something new for Portville. Did he take anything?\" \"No; he was taken himself.\" \"Surely you were not a match for him?\" \"No, sir; but Mr. Crane captured him, and he is now in the lock-up.\" \"Ah, yes; our good friend the blacksmith. He is a muscular man.\" \"He is going home happy with the check that you gave him.\" \"I was glad to be of service to him, as he in all probability saved my life. But I have not done anything for you. You must apply to me whenever you need assistance. Do you go into Mr. Tubbs\u0027s store on Monday?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Come round next Saturday evening and tell me how you like it. I was your father\u0027s friend; I shall be glad if you will consider me yours.\" \"I shall be very glad to do so, Mr. Nugent,\" said Gerald, earnestly. \"Who was that you were talking with?\" asked Abel, whom he met a minute later. \"Mr. Nugent.\" \"The rich man? Why didn\u0027t you introduce me?\" \"I will some time if I have the opportunity.\" \"You are going to work Monday, ma tells me.\" \"Yes.\" \"She says a grocery store will be a good place for you.\" \"Would you like it?\" \"No. I\u0027m going to be a lawyer or a civil engineer—I haven\u0027t decided which.\" Gerald smiled. He had very little faith in Abel\u0027s ever being either.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82351.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
