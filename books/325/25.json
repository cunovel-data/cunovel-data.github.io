{"id":8858,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV A PERILOUS RIDE","content":"Gerald paid little attention to the caution that had been given him. He looked upon it as given more in jest than in earnest. But had he known that the conversation had been listened to by a stranger whose outward appearance suggested the tramp or desperado he would have felt a degree of apprehension. This man had been staying in the village for a couple of days; he had been one of the loungers at the store, and had listened to all the gossip that was in circulation. Among other things he had heard about the attempt at robbery in which Thomas Nixon came near being a victim, and had listened with interest to speculations about the money kept on hand by the old man. When he heard the conversation between Gerald and the storekeeper he understood that the boy was about to carry a large sum in gold coins to the bank in Fairfield. Now, Saul Gridley was in a penniless condition. He was very much in want of money, and by no means scrupulous as to the method of filling his depleted pocketbook. He had served time in more than one prison, and had no character to lose. It is not strange, therefore, that he considered the present opportunity a good one for placing his finances in a satisfactory condition. Issuing bonds—a method recently made popular—was impracticable. He speedily formed his plans, and set out at a quick pace en route for Fairfield. Gerald was detained for half an hour, partly from the necessity of going back to the Nixon home to obtain the gold. There, too, he found something to do for the old man. He lifted the tin box into the wagon and started away. When he had gone two miles on the road he began to think over the caution which had been given him by Joe Loche. The road, he saw, was a lonely one. It was uneven, and not across the level prairie, for Montana, as its name indicates, is a hilly State. \"It would be quite possible for me to be robbed if I should meet a highwayman,\" he reflected. \"I am only a boy, and, hampered as I am by the care of a team, I should be unable to make resistance. What shall I do to insure safety?\" Gerald began to doubt the expedience of carrying the gold in the tin box, as in the recent attempt at robbery it had become generally known that Mr. Nixon used the box as a receptacle for his treasure. Anyone seeing it in the wagon would at once conjecture its contents. However, this matter could be set right with little trouble. Montana, unlike most Western States, is rocky, and there were plenty of rocks and small stones near at hand. This gave Gerald an idea. He halted his horse, and began to stuff the gold coins into his pockets. Then he got out of the team and collected an equal bulk of small stones. These he put into the tin box, and then locked it with a key, with which Mr. Nixon had supplied him. The stones rattled as the team made its way over the rough road. \"I don\u0027t suppose it was necessary,\" said Gerald to himself. \"Still, it is well to be on the safe side.\" He drove a mile further. In the three miles he had met but one team, for the road was an unfrequented one, as Montana was only sparsely settled, and the towns were far apart. Gerald began to think he should not meet any one during the whole distance. This would, of course be satisfactory, and would spare him all anxiety. If he met any one after his errand was completed, and the money safely stored in the Fairfield, bank, it would not matter. It was fortunate that Gerald made the transfer, for in less than half a mile he was stopped by the man who had overheard the conversation between him and Joe Loche. \"Can\u0027t you give a poor fellow a lift, youngster?\" asked the tramp. Gerald hesitated. He noted the appearance of the man, and felt that it might not be safe to refuse outright. \"Where do you want to go?\" \"A mile or two,\" answered the tramp, with a leer. Gerald considered whether it would be safe to lash the horse and attempt to get away from his troublesome acquaintance, but it did not seem to be practicable. Yet to take him as a passenger, with so valuable a treasure on board, was certainly hazardous. If he had been sure that the tramp was not armed, he might have attempted flight; but of this he could not be sure. \"I will give you a lift for a mile or so,\" he said. With a smile the tramp clambered in and took a seat beside him. He stretched out his legs with a look of satisfaction. \"And where might you be going, youngster?\" he asked Gerald. \"I am going to Fairfield.\" \"On business?\" \"Well, there is a small matter of business I have to attend to.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"I am living at present in Campville.\" \"This is Joe Loche\u0027s team, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes.\" \"You don\u0027t live with him, do you?\" \"No.\" \"With whom, then?\" \"With an old man near the store.\" \"Old man Nixon?\" \"Yes,\" answered Gerald, reluctantly. \"Humph! that\u0027s the man that came near getting robbed yesterday?\" \"Yes,\" answered Gerald, uneasily. \"Lemme see. He kept a lot of gold pieces in the house.\" \"You seem to know all about it.\" \"Yes; I heard. He kept them in a tin box—very much like that,\" and the tramp indicated the box in the wagon. \"Well, suppose he did?\" said Gerald, eyeing his companion closely. The tramp laughed. \"Only that you\u0027ve got the box in this here wagon, and the gold, too.\" \"Now for it!\" thought Gerald. \"The crisis is near at hand!\" \"You might be mistaken,\" he answered, trying not to show the excitement he felt. \"And then again I mightn\u0027t. You\u0027re taking the gold to the bank in Fairfield.\" \"Who told you so?\" \"Ah, the cat\u0027s out of the bag!\" said the tramp, triumphantly. \"Well,\" said Gerald, with apparent frankness, \"as you seem to know I may as well own up that you are right. I am glad to have you with me, as some one might try to rob me, and I can rely on your assistance.\" The tramp laughed long and loud. \"Oh, yes,\" he replied, \"you can depend on me. I won\u0027t let anyone else have the money.\" \"Thank you! I feel safe now.\" The tramp laughed again. To him it seemed like a delicious joke. He did not seem to be in a hurry to possess himself of the booty, as he felt sure he could have it at any time. It was a good joke that Gerald seemed quite unsuspicious of his intentions. \"How much gold might there be in the box?\" he asked. \"Not far from a thousand dollars,\" said Gerald, frankly. The tramp smacked his lips. He had never before bagged so much booty. It really seemed like a big stroke of luck. \"A thousand dollars!\" he repeated. \"That\u0027s a big sum!\" \"Yes, it is a large sum, as you say.\" \"Suppose you and I divide it. That\u0027ll be five hundred apiece.\" \"I see you are joking,\" said Gerald. \"It isn\u0027t ours. It belongs to Mr. Nixon.\" \"He\u0027s an old man. He don\u0027t need it. Besides, he has plenty more.\" \"Has he really?\" asked Gerald, innocently. \"To be sure! Everybody knows that the old man is a miser. Why, I\u0027ve no doubt he is worth ten thousand dollars.\" \"Nor have I any doubt,\" said Gerald to himself. \"But, of course, that is none of our business.\" \"Look here, youngster; you seem to be as simple as they make \u0027em.\" \"Why?\" asked Gerald, in affected surprise. \"You can\u0027t see that I am a bad man, and have made up my mind to have that gold.\" \"You don\u0027t really mean it? You are trying to frighten me.\" \"No more nonsense! Stop the horse, and I\u0027ll relieve you of the box.\" \"But what will Mr. Nixon say?\" \"Tell him it was taken from you.\" \"Oh, this is terrible! Won\u0027t you take ten dollars and let me go?\" \"No; I must have the whole. Stop the horse, I say!\" With an appearance of great reluctance Gerald obeyed directions and halted the horse. The tramp descended from the wagon. \"Now hand me the box,\" he said. Gerald allowed him to take out the box. Then he whipped up the horse, leaving the tramp, as he supposed, master of the situation. He laughed as he saw Gerald driving off. \"The boy is pretty well scared,\" he said to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82365.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
