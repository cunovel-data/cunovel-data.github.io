{"id":8859,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI SAUL GRIDLEY SEEKS REVENGE","content":"The tramp was only amused by Gerald\u0027s precipitate flight. There was no object in pursuing him, as he had obtained what he sought—the box of gold coins. He was in a hurry to open it, and realize his good fortune. He felt that Fortune had been kind to him. When once the gold was transferred to his pockets, he would leave the neighborhood, as he knew very well that by the miners\u0027 code the robbery would be punished with death. There was an obstacle, however, to his realizing the fruits of victory. The tin box was locked. \"Why didn\u0027t the kid give me the key?\" he complained, in a tone of annoyance. However, that was not a serious consideration. He could break open the box with a large stone, and he at once began to look for one. He had to go some distance before he found one that would answer his purpose. Meanwhile, as he carried the box, he heard from time to time the rattling of the coins as he interpreted the sound, though, as we know, the noise was made by the gravel stones with which Gerald had weighted the box. However, it was only prolonging his anticipation, and anticipation is always pleasant. He laughed to himself as he thought of Gerald arriving at the bank without the gold. Decidedly it was the richest joke of the season. At last he found a stone that suited his purpose, and began to hammer away at the lock of the box. There was only slight delay. The lid flew open, and with a smile of gleeful anticipation the thief looked into it. The bitterness of his disappointment can scarcely be imagined. The cup of success was dashed from his lips just as he was ready to taste its contents. The result of his enterprise was only a heap of gravel stones! \"The boy has made an idiot of me!\" he said, bitterly. \"But where is the gold?\" It did not take him long to guess the nature of the trick that Gerald had played upon him. He gnashed his teeth with rage when he thought of Gerald riding away with the gold in his pocket, or elsewhere secreted in the wagon. \"I\u0027d like to choke the kid!\" he growled between his set teeth. He understood now why Gerald had driven away so rapidly. If there had been the slightest chance of overtaking him, he would have set out in pursuit. But by this time the boy was nearly a mile away, and it would have been foolish for him to entertain such a thought. In his anger he kicked the tin box furiously; and, not content with that, he picked it up and flung it as far as he was able. He pictured to himself Gerald entering the bank and depositing the gold—his gold, as he regarded it—and entertaining the bank officials with an account of the way in which he had evaded the robber. If only he could be revenged upon Gerald, that would be a satisfaction though the gold coins were lost. Meanwhile Gerald kept on his way till he reached the bank. He introduced himself to the receiving teller as representing Mr. Nixon, and began to draw out the gold coins from his pocket. \"You seem loaded down with gold,\" said the teller. \"Why didn\u0027t you bring the money in a box or bag?\" \"I started with it in a box, but put it in my pockets for security.\" \"You thought that more secure?\" \"Yes, sir. But for my doing so I should have been robbed.\" \"How is that?\" Gerald explained the encounter with the tramp. \"I see you are right,\" said the teller, approvingly. \"The thief will probably be considerably disappointed when he opens the box.\" \"I should like to have been present and witnessed his surprise,\" said Gerald, laughing. \"Are you not afraid he will waylay you on your way back, and try to get revenge?\" Gerald looked thoughtful. He realized the danger. \"What would you advise me to do?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll tell you. How soon do you start?\" \"In an hour.\" \"Would you object to a companion?\" \"No. I should be glad of company.\" \"Then it can be arranged. My brother-in-law wants to go to Campville. He is a strong, robust man, who is six feet in height, and would tip the scales at two hundred. If you have him with you I think your dishonest friend won\u0027t be in any hurry to attack you.\" Gerald listened to these words with satisfaction. He knew that the highwayman was more than a match for him in physical strength, and might inflict upon him a serious injury. The plan proposed would insure his safety. It chanced at this moment that the person referred to entered the bank. \"Louis,\" said the receiving teller, \"here is a young man who offers to give you a ride to Campville.\" \"I shall consider it quite a favor.\" \"I ought to warn you that he may be stopped by a highwayman. If you feel nervous——\" \"If there is only one person, I think we can manage him, Mr.——\" \"Lane—Gerald Lane. Mr. Lane, here is my brother-in-law, Louis Bean.\" Gerald shook hands with his new acquaintance, and gave a brief account of his encounter with the tramp on his way over. \"We will give him a warm reception if he undertakes to attack us, Mr. Lane. You played a neat trick on him. So you represent Mr. Nixon?\" \"Yes, sir. I shall remain with him for a time.\" \"Have you known him long?\" \"I was sent out by a friend in the East, to whom he wrote, explaining his need of help.\" \"I suppose the old man is rich?\" \"At any rate, he has money enough to support himself in comfort.\" \"He hasn\u0027t enjoyed much of that for some years. I remember his cabin at Campville. It wasn\u0027t fit for any one to live in.\" \"I induced him to move into the house formerly occupied by Jim Morris.\" \"Was he willing to move? Didn\u0027t he mind the expense?\" \"Mr. Nixon is not a mean man. He lived poorly because he had not energy enough to make other arrangements. He lets me spend whatever I like for him.\" \"He is fortunate in having someone to look after him. When do you want to start?\" \"As soon as I have had some dinner. Is there a restaurant or hotel in the town?\" \"No, but I will take you round to my house. Mrs. Bean will be glad to give you a dinner.\" Half an hour later Gerald and his new friend set out for Campville. \"If your friend of the morning stops you,\" said Louis Bean, \"it will be at a point about four miles distant. When we approach the place I will get out and conceal myself, to give him a chance to show what he intends to do. I will see that he does no harm. We will have another joke at his expense!\" This proposal suited Gerald, who had no objection to a second discomfiture of the ruffian from whom he had already had one narrow escape. At the point indicated by his companion, Louis Bean got out of the wagon and hid himself behind a clump of trees. \"Perhaps he may have seen me,\" he said. \"If so, we shall have no fun. We shall soon find out.\" \"When matters are near the danger line,\" said Bean, \"blow this whistle.\" Gerald drove on slowly, hoping that the ruffian would appear. He had a sense of humor which would be gratified by the opportunity to turn the tables on him. Saul Gridley\u0027s anger had not cooled in the three hours since he saw Gerald riding off, after serving him a trick which humiliated him the more because he felt that he had been worsted by a mere boy. He resolved to punish him for the trick, and felt sure that he would have a chance to do it. There was but one road by which Gerald could return from Fairfield—the same road by which he went. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82366.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
