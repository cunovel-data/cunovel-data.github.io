{"id":8865,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII IMPRISONED","content":"Gerald lost no time in writing a letter to Thomas Nixon, to let him know of his arrival in Ransom and his adventures up to date. He finished by advising Mr. Nixon not to sell his share in the mine for less than forty thousand dollars. \"Indeed,\" he added, \"I think I can find you a purchaser at that price.\" He did not make himself known to Nelson Hawk, but remained at the hotel waiting for further developments. He did not observe that one of the miners who hung about the hotel surveyed him curiously, nor had he any idea that he was recognized. But this miner—Jack Manton—remembered to have seen him at Campville, and knew his connection with old Tom Nixon, whose interest in the mine was well known. Desiring to ingratiate himself with the superintendent, he joined him in the street as he was leaving the mine, and said, touching his hat: \"Mr. Hawk, may I have a few words with you?\" \"Go on,\" said Hawk, impatiently, \"but my time is valuable.\" \"It will be worth your while to hear me. Have you seen a boy about the hotel?\" \"Yes; what of it?\" \"Do you know who he is?\" \"No. Is he a person of any importance?\" \"I should say so. He is secretary and companion—whatever you may choose to call it—to old Tom Nixon.\" Nelson Hawk uttered an exclamation of dismay. \"Are you sure of that?\" he asked hurriedly. \"Certainly I am.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I saw him at Campville three weeks ago and I know he lives with old Tom.\" Straightway it flashed upon the superintendent\u0027s mind that he had discussed the condition of the mine with Matthew Grote in hearing of this boy. He must, he felt convinced, have spoken of its large output, having no idea that this youth was an agent of his partner. If this were the case all his plans were upset. Gerald would of course communicate what he had heard to the old man. What was to be done? He must question Gerald and find out how much he knew, and whether he had written to Mr. Nixon. So when he next saw Gerald in the hotel he sat down beside him. \"Where do you come from, young man? Haven\u0027t I seen you in Campville?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Have you been there recently?\" \"No, but one of my men has. Do you know old Tom Nixon?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Did he send you here?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Nelson Hawk breathed hard. All his fears were realized. \"Have you any communication for me? I wrote recently to Mr. Nixon, offering him a large sum for his interest in the mine. Do you think he will accept?\" \"I know he will not.\" \"Why?\" \"Because it is worth much more than you offered.\" \"Shall you advise him to refuse my offer?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"That is frank. I suppose you heard me say to Mr. Grote that the output had increased?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And naturally you concluded that it is worth more than I offered. But there is another side to the question—expenses have increased, too. It is harder to work. Would you like to visit the mine and see for yourself?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Gerald, promptly. Hawk\u0027s eyes lighted up with satisfaction. \"Very well,\" he said; \"we will go at once.\" They proceeded to the mine, half a mile away, and Hawk signaled for the elevator. It was a large cask, operated by a windlass. \"Get in,\" he said. They did so, and began slowly to descend. The mine was about three hundred feet deep. Touching bottom, they left the tub, and Hawk began to show Gerald about, talking in a desultory way. At length they reached a side cavern, and Hawk led the way in. Then his manner changed. \"Boy,\" he said, \"are you authorized to sell Mr. Nixon\u0027s interest in the mine?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I will give twenty thousand dollars.\" \"I can\u0027t take it.\" \"Be careful! You may come to harm if you don\u0027t?\" \"What do you mean?\" demanded Gerald, startled. \"I mean that I will keep you confined in this room until you agree to the bargain!\" Gerald turned pale. He saw that he was in a trap. \"I can\u0027t betray Mr. Nixon\u0027s interests.\" Hawk opened the door and went out, thrusting Gerald back. \"I will come here to-morrow morning,\" he said. \"By that time you may have come to your senses.\" \"Let me out!\" exclaimed Gerald, vehemently. \"So I will, if you agree to my terms.\" In a moment the door was locked, and Gerald found himself immured in a cavern three hundred feet below the surface of the earth.
