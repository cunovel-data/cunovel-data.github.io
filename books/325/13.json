{"id":8846,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII AN ARTFUL TRICK","content":"It was a difficult matter to decide. Gerald had a natural dislike to become an informer or expose his fellow-clerk, though he felt that Mr. Tubbs ought to know how he was being robbed. So he let the day pass without speaking of what he had seen. He was no longer surprised that Brandon could spend so much money on billiards, since it did not come out of his salary, but out of his employer\u0027s till. In the evening he called upon Mr. Nugent and asked his advice. \"Have you told Mr. Tubbs what you discovered?\" asked the old gentleman. \"No, sir.\" \"You should do so.\" \"I don\u0027t like to expose Brandon.\" \"I can understand your objection, but nevertheless it is your duty to do so.\" \"I wish he would discover it in some other way.\" \"He is not likely to do so.\" \"He may not believe me.\" \"At any rate you will have done your duty.\" \"I will think it over, Mr. Nugent. In the meantime I am obliged to you for your advice.\" \"I shall always be glad to advise you,\" said Mr. Nugent, kindly. \"You are a straightforward and honorable boy, and I have all confidence in you.\" \"Thank you, sir. I am glad to have you say that. Suppose Brandon denies it?\" \"You can suggest to Mr. Tubbs to put a marked bill in the drawer, and then try to trace it in case it is taken.\" \"I will do so.\" But Gerald did not have an opportunity to make use of Mr. Nugent\u0027s advice. During the day he had shown a degree of perturbation occasioned by his discovery of Brandon\u0027s treachery that had excited the notice of his fellow-clerk. Guilt is always suspicious, and Brandon, knowing his own dishonesty, was constantly on the watch for the detection which he dreaded. \"The kid suspects me,\" he said to himself. \"I must forestall him.\" Accordingly, when the store closed, he did not offer to go out with Gerald, but said: \"I am not quite ready to go yet.\" This suited Gerald, who had intended to call on Mr. Nugent to ask his advice. He therefore said \"Good night!\" and walked away. Brandon watched him go up the road, and then reentering the store just as his employer was ready to leave, said: \"Can you stop a minute, Mr. Tubbs?\" \"Certainly. What is it?\" \"I have something to say to you—something important.\" \"Indeed!\" said the grocer, surprised. \"Have you—missed any money within a few days?\" \"I can\u0027t say. Why do you ask?\" \"Because I saw something to-day that startled me. Do you think Gerald is honest?\" \"Bless my soul, of course! He comes of a good family. His father was highly respected.\" \"That may be; but there are plenty of boys and men belonging to respectable families who cannot be relied upon.\" \"What did you see? What makes you suspect the boy?\" \"I saw him take a bill from the drawer this afternoon. Suppose you examine it, and see if you miss anything.\" The grocer opened the drawer hastily. \"I can\u0027t tell,\" he said, slowly. \"I didn\u0027t keep track of the bills in the drawer.\" \"I did. There was a five-dollar bill paid by Mr. Bacon for a barrel of flour.\" \"So there was, Brandon—so there was.\" \"See if you can find the five-dollar bill in the drawer.\" \"No, I can\u0027t,\" returned Mr. Tubbs, after a brief examination. \"Then that was the bill the boy took.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it; so young, too, and so honest-looking!\" \"He is evidently very artful,\" said Brandon. \"I am sorry, Mr. Tubbs, I am really sorry to be obliged to inform against him, but I felt it to be my duty.\" \"You are a good fellow, Brandon,\" said the grocer, grasping his hand. \"You have done what you ought to do. I feel that you are a true friend.\" \"I try to be, sir; but I will own that I had a selfish motive.\" \"What is it?\" \"I thought if you missed the bill you might suspect me.\" \"No, Brandon; I could hardly do that, after the long time you have been with me.\" \"Yes, sir, I have been in your employ five years, and I humbly hope that you have found me faithful, sir.\" \"Yes, Brandon,\" said the deceived grocer, \"I have always found you faithful.\" Brandon laughed in his sleeve. He found his task easier than he had supposed it would be. Mr. Tubbs was a ready dupe. \"It seems terrible,\" said the grocer. \"What would his poor father have said if he had lived to know of the boy\u0027s dishonesty?\" \"Perhaps if his father had lived he would not have stolen.\" \"What do you think I ought to do, Brandon? Would you advise me to have him arrested?\" \"No, sir. Ask him to return the bill he took from the drawer. If he denies having taken it, you will know what to think.\" \"True; your advice is good. I will speak to him to-morrow morning. Thank you, for telling me what you saw.\" The store was closed, and the two went in different directions—Mr. Tubbs towards his home, Brandon to the billiard-room. The latter smiled as he pushed on his way. \"What would the old man have thought,\" he said to himself, \"if he knew that I had the parson\u0027s bill in my own pocket? My friend Gerald, I have spiked your guns, as you will find if you undertake to make trouble for me. You are altogether too innocent. You are too good to play billiards, but you will find yourself in something worse. The next morning Gerald came to the store earlier than usual, for he wanted an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Tubbs. The grocer, unlike most men in business for themselves, generally was first on the ground and opened the store himself. It was a habit he had formed when a subordinate. He always rose early and had an early breakfast, so that this involved no self-denial on his part. Brandon, to give Mr. Tubbs an opportunity of speaking to Gerald, didn\u0027t come round till twenty minutes after his usual time. Gerald noticed that the grocer looked unusually grave, but was quite unprepared for what was to come. \"Good morning, Mr. Tubbs,\" he said, in a pleasant tone. The grocer did not return his greeting, but said: \"Gerald, there is something I wish to speak to you about.\" \"Yes, sir. I wished also to speak to you.\" \"I wonder whether he is going to confess,\" thought Mr. Tubbs. \"What have you to say to me?\" \"I think a bank bill was taken from your money-drawer yesterday.\" Mr. Tubbs was amazed. What did it mean? Was it possible that the boy was going to make a clean breast of his dishonesty? \"A bank bill was taken from the drawer yesterday,\" he said—\"a five-dollar note.\" \"I didn\u0027t know that it was a five,\" said Gerald. \"I didn\u0027t suppose you had discovered it.\" \"I am glad, however, that you have confessed the theft to me. Return the bill, and I will overlook your fault.\" \"What on earth do you mean, Mr. Tubbs?\" ejaculated Gerald. \"You surely do not think that I took the money?\" \"Certainly I do.\" \"Then, sir, you are very much mistaken,\" said Gerald, indignantly. \"I was never dishonest in all my life.\" \"Some one must have taken the money.\" \"Some one did.\" \"Who, may I ask?\" \"Brandon! I saw him take it from the drawer when he was putting in a smaller sum, which he had been paid for groceries.\" \"This is shameful, Gerald Lane,\" said Mr. Tubbs, angrily. \"It is not enough that you take my money, but you seek to place the crime upon an innocent man.\" \"You are very much mistaken, Mr. Tubbs,\" said Gerald, pale but resolute. \"I saw Brandon take the money with my own eyes, but I did not know that it was a five-dollar bill. How did you discover your loss?\" \"It was called to my attention last evening by Brandon himself.\" \"He told you the drawer had been robbed!\" exclaimed Gerald, in amazement. \"Yes.\" \"Then he must have done it to divert suspicion from himself. Probably he had the note in his pocket when he was speaking to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82353.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
