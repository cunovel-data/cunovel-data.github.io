{"id":8868,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV JOHN GRAVES REAPPEARS","content":"We must now go back to Portville and gather some information about Gerald\u0027s family. Mrs. Lane lived in the old mansion that had belonged to his father. Abel also lived with her. He had teased her to go to the city to live, but she hesitated, partly from motives of prudence and partly from a thought of the temptations to which she feared Abel would yield. She did not find her son a source of satisfaction. He was irritable and unpleasant in his manner, and a source of anxiety to her. One day he came in and broke out: \"What do you think I heard this morning?\" \"I don\u0027t know. You had better tell me at once.\" \"Gerald is on his way home.\" \"Is he indeed? Who told you?\" \"Munroe Hill. He lives near Mr. Nugent, you know. Mr. Nugent told him. Are you going to let him come here?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" replied Mrs. Lane, hesitatingly. \"I presume he has some money.\" \"Then let him pay board. You can\u0027t afford to support him.\" \"People might say ill-natured things, as I received all my money from his father.\" \"Let them talk! It is none of their business. That reminds me, ma. Can\u0027t you let me have five dollars?\" \"I let you have some money three days ago,\" said Mrs. Lane, frowning. \"What did you do with it?\" \"It was only three dollars.\" \"That is a good deal of money for a boy of your age. You seem to think I am made of money.\" \"You mustn\u0027t get mean, ma. Why, Mr. Lane left you as much as fifty thousand dollars. I have heard you say so.\" \"I will give you two dollars, and not a cent more. Don\u0027t ask me for any more for a week.\" Abel did not commit himself, but taking the money, went down the street, where he soon spent part of it playing pool with a young man of not the best reputation. Mrs. Lane sat down at her desk, and began to examine her accounts. \"Fifty thousand dollars!\" she mused. \"Yes, it is a goodly sum, and will maintain Abel and myself in comfort all our lives. I am sorry he is growing so extravagant. I shall have to check him. In one month I shall hand in my final accounts, and shall come into undisputed possession of my money. Then I shall be able to carry out the plan I have had in view so long, and will make a tour of Europe with Abel. I am told that it does not cost as much to travel in Europe as in this country. There, free from all money cares, I can enjoy myself. I can hardly wait for the time to come.\" She closed her book and leaned back in her chair, in complacent thought. But her meditation was soon interrupted. \"There\u0027s a gentleman below wishes to see you, Mrs. Lane,\" said Susan, the servant. \"Who is it? Did you ever see him before?\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"What name did he give?\" \"Here\u0027s his card, ma\u0027am. I came near forgetting to give it to you.\" Mrs. Lane took the card from the servant\u0027s hand, and glanced at it. She turned pale and uttered a half exclamation. Of all men in the world John Graves was about the last she wished to see. It was he who had deposited thirty thousand dollars in her husband\u0027s hands, and now, doubtless, he had come to claim it. This would take away more than half of the fortune on whose possession she had been congratulating herself. What should she do? While she was considering this difficult question, Mr. Graves was ushered into the room. He was a man of somewhat less than medium size, sixty years of age, but looking considerably older on account of his white hair and beard. \"Mrs. Lane?\" he said inquiringly. \"That\u0027s my name,\" she answered stiffly. \"I have been living in Australia,\" he resumed, \"for many years. Circumstances cut me off from news, and it is only since I came to Portville that I learned the sad news of your husband\u0027s death.\" Mrs. Lane did not reply, but regarded him with a frosty air. \"It seems my poor friend has been dead nearly two years?\" \"Yes.\" John Graves regarded her with some surprise, so cold and repelling was her manner. \"Our relations were very confidential,\" continued Graves. \"Before I went away I deposited in your husband\u0027s hands, as he doubtless told you, the sum of thirty thousand dollars.\" \"You are mistaken, sir,\" returned Mrs. Lane, in an icy tone. \"He never told me any such thing, and you must pardon me for saying that I do not believe such a preposterous statement!\" John Graves arched his eyebrows in amazement, and regarded Mrs. Lane for a moment without speaking. \"Did your husband leave no memorandum respecting my deposit?\" he asked, after a pause. \"No, sir.\" \"That is very remarkable.\" \"It is more remarkable that you should come here with such a barefaced claim—a claim that would sweep away more than half of the estate my husband left.\" \"Then you doubt the genuineness of my claim?\" he asked, calmly. \"I do.\" \"Then I will say good-by—for the present.\" John Graves rose, and, with a bow, left the room. Mrs. Lane breathed a sigh of relief. \"I think I have gotten rid of him,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2987/82375.html","bookId":325,"book":{"id":325,"title":"Making His Mark","description":"简介： Mrs. Lane was a thin woman, rather above the usual height, with a prominent nose and thin lips.
