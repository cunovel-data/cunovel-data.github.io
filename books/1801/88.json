{"id":81105,"no":88,"title":"Page 88","content":"\"I think you\u0027re right. How could I have let you go, Sariana? You\u0027re part of me now. But don\u0027t I get some credit for at least trying to do the noble thing?\" \"Of course, my love.\" She watched him drag his victim to shore. The bandit sputtered and coughed and then proceeded to lose the contents of his stomach. \"Keenshee guano,\" Gryph muttered, yanking his bare foot out of the way. \"This is my reward for humoring my wife. I\u0027d like to know what you plan to do with this piece of garbage now that you\u0027ve saved his neck.\" \"He should be taken back to Little Chance to stand trial,\" Sariana said stoutly. Gryph just looked at her as if she weren\u0027t very bright. \"We already know he\u0027s guilty of everything from dealing with live prisma to attempted murder.\" \"That\u0027s for a jury to determine.\" \"Sariana, have you gone mad? This man is Shield business. My business. In case you haven\u0027t figured it out yet, I am his judge and his jury.\" \"Well, you\u0027re not going to be his executioner,\" she told him forcefully. \"I\u0027ve been doing a lot of thinking lately and I\u0027ve decided that one of your problems is that Shields have kept to themselves too much. They operate too independently of the rest of society. They\u0027re too secretive. There are too many mysteries surrounding them. They deliberately do things that keep people in awe of them. They take pride in their reputations as warriors. But the plain truth is they exist on the fringes of respectable society. That\u0027s a dangerous place to be in the long run. It not only makes you Shields vulnerable as a class, it also stunts your growth.\" \"What in the name of the Lightstonn are you talking about now?\" Sariana clambered back on board the sled. \"I told you I\u0027ve been doing some thinking about this, Gryph. I\u0027m convinced that you Shields aren\u0027t going to last much longer as an important, respectable class unless you take steps to modernize yourselves. The people of this world are moving fast on both continents. You have to move with the times. You have to stop living solely on the frontiers. What are you going to do when there are no more bandits to fight?\" \"There will always be bandits of one kind or another,\" Gryph said with certainty. \"Well, perhaps, but the people of the western provinces may decide they can form their own militia to control them, just as they\u0027ve formed their own town guards.\" \"Sariana, this isn\u0027t exactly the time or the place to discuss social philosophy.\" But Sariana was in full sail. She had some points to make and now seemed like an excellent time to make them. \"I\u0027ll tell you something else, Gryph. I bet it wouldn\u0027t be nearly as hard for Shields to find wives if they had easier access to the same society and opportunities the other classes have. Oh, sure, according to the Pact, you can look for a wife at any level of society, but as it stands, most respectable families keep their daughters quietly out of sight when they know there\u0027s a Shield in the vicinity. Who would want to lose a daughter to some stranger whose only job skills are throat cutting and working prisma? They know he\u0027ll sweep the poor girl away from home and family and society and take her to live in some remote frontier town. I\u0027ll tell you right now, most mothers will fight that tooth and nail. Most fathers probably will, too. No wonder you Shields have a hard time meeting potential Shield-mates. When was the last time anyone invited one of you to tea?\" \"I can\u0027t remember,\" Gryph said dryly. He stood on the shore, his nude body poised and powerful above the retching, choking bandit at his feet and he stared at his wife. Gryph\u0027s expression in the reflected glow of the vapor lamp was an interesting mixture, of amusement and exasperation. \"I\u0027m telling you, Gryph, Shields have got to take a good look at the future and plan for it. Granted, your original role as a class was an important one, but times are changing. You have to integrate yourselves into mainstream society or you\u0027re going to find your whole class getting smaller and less important as the rest of the world grows. That would be a pity, and perhaps potentially lethal for the rest of us.\" \"I\u0027m glad to know we\u0027d be missed, but how do you figure our absence might prove lethal for everyone else?\" \"Gryph, someday we\u0027re going to get back into space. With eastern financial wizardry and western technology that day probably isn\u0027t too far off. When we do we might very well find the beings who built those prisma ships waiting for us. Shields might come in very handy again at some point in the future.\" \"That\u0027s an easterner for you. Always planning ahead.\" \"I think your main problem is that your class is male dominated. Women only become members when they marry into it and there have been no daughters born into the clans. That means the males have made most of the policies and, to be perfectly blunt, males tend to be highly conservative by nature. You\u0027ve stuck with the old ways because you didn\u0027t want to experiment with change. Yet all the other classes on both continents are changing rapidly. It\u0027s time for the Shields to start changing, too.\" \"What makes me think you have come up with some master plan for restructuring my entire social class?\" \"I\u0027ll assume that\u0027s a rhetorical question. But as it happens, I\u0027ve got some ideas I think you and the other Shields should consider.\" \"Somehow that doesn\u0027t surprise me.\" Sariana was totally involved in her budding ideas. Absently she began to pace the deck of the sled. She was so enthralled in what she was planning that she didn\u0027t notice the chill of her wet chemise. \"The fundamental key to changing the Shields\u0027 role in society is to change their financial and business relationships with that society. You have to evolve out of your limited bandit hunting and find new financial niches for yourselves. What you need,\" she concluded triumphantly, \"is a good business manager. Someone who can tackle the job of restructuring the economic position of an entire class.\" \"And as it happens,\" Gryph observed, \"a very aggressive business manager has just recently married into my social class.\" Sariana smiled her brilliant smile. \"As it happens, you\u0027re right. This could be a lucky day for you and your entire class, Gryph.\" He grinned. \"Tell me something. Just how do you plan to change a whole class of frontier warriors into respectable craftsmen and business people?\" \"That\u0027s easy,\" Sariana said smoothly. \"All you need is a solid financial base and some shrewd investment advice. By a strange and interesting coincidence, you have recently come into possession of a cavern full of financial capital. In the past you Shields have obviously not handled the sale of your prisma with any great skill. There\u0027s a vast difference between selling your capital and investing it so that it continues to earn for you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-88.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
