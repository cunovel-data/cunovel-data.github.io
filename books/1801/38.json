But it would be another matter altogether to do it in front of one of your countrymen. Think how embarrassed you would be afterward.\"\\n\\n Sariana was growing lightheaded with her anger. She was so outraged she couldn\u0027t even speak. She looked into Gryph\u0027s eyes and it dawned on her with alarming clarity that he was right. She couldn\u0027t throw a tantrum in front of Etion. It was unthinkable. She had to get out of this office and the only way out was with Gryph.\\n\\n The only way out was with Gryph.\\n\\n Where had she gotten that notion? she wondered. It had just popped into her head. It reminded her of the way other words and sensations had jumped, unbidden, into her head the previous night as she lay in Gryph\u0027s arms. Perhaps she was on the edge of some sort of emotional breakdown, she thought hysterically. Maybe she was starting to hallucinate. Perhaps this was all a nightmare fabricated by her overwrought brain. But even as she questioned her sanity, she was walking toward the door; her hand lifting to accept Gryph\u0027s outstretched arm.\\n\\n At the last second she shook off the odd compulsion she\u0027d had to accept the mockery of gentlemanly assistance and brushed past him without taking his arm. She didn\u0027t look back, nor did she hesitate. She made straight for the huge carved doors at the end of the wide banking hall. She was aware that Gryph was following. When he caught up with her she ignored him. The small weight of the scarlet-toe on her shoulder was the only comfort she had. The lizard clung to the fabric of her dress with its tiny claws. She had the distinct impression the creature was jubilant about leaving Etion\u0027s office.\\n\\n Gryph walked beside Sariana in silence. She refused to turn her head or speak to him, but she was suffocatingly aware of his presence. He was too tall, too strong, too big in every way. She felt smothered\\n\\n by his nearness. She wanted to flee from him and at the same time she wanted to scream at him. The mix of emotions left her feeling powerless. Sariana was not accustomed to handling such a dangerous combination of sensations.\\n\\n Without a word she and Gryph made their way through the crowded streets. Neither of them paid much attention to the carriages or dragonponies and riders who tried to claim the thoroughfares. As if the drivers and riders sensed that these two were not playing the game today, they stayed out of the way.\\n\\n By the time she was walking through the villa doors and down the long gallery to her suite, Sariana was seething with frustrated rage. Gryph followed her silently into her room and she turned on him in fury.\\n\\n \"You are a bastard. A complete and utter bastard. You call yourself a gentleman. You claim to be a lord and that you are descended from a Prime Family but you lie. You must be lying. Either that or you are a disgrace to your clan. You have treated me abominably. No gentleman would have acted as you have acted.\"\\n\\n \"Sariana, I know you\u0027re angry and I guess you have a right to be, but - \"\\n\\n \"Angry?\" she blazed, backing toward the writing table. \"Angry? You don\u0027t know the meaning of the word.\" She sought for and found some of the colorful phrases the locals used. \"You are the arrogant, deceitful, lying spawn of a cloaksnake. With your degree of talent you should consider a career in dragonpony manure production. You have the sensitivity and understanding of a hawkbcetle. You are lower than the son of a needlerat. Worse than that. You must be the result of the mating of a pair of particularly slimey swamp toads. You have the sense of honor of a wharfsnake. I doubt your claim to a legitimate clan, do you hear me?\"\\n\\n \"I hear you,\" Gryph said. \"But let\u0027s leave my clan out of this.\" He stripped off his jacket and slung it over one shoulder. Then he stalked across the chamber to where a beautifully faceted wine carafe sat on a hospitality table. He picked up the carafe and splashed the contents into a tiny glass.\\n\\n \"By all means let\u0027s leave your clan out of this,\" Sariana snapped. \"That sounds entirely reasonable considering the fact that there is apparently some question as to the origin of your entire social class.\" She couldn\u0027t think of a worse insult.\\n\\n Gryph cocked one brow at her as he took a long swallow of wine. \"Is that right? Who told you that? Rakken?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he did, as a matter of fact. He also told me about some totally ridiculous legend your people have managed to feed the rest of the westerners in order to win all sorts of special privileges.\"\\n\\n \"Rakken is surprisingly well-informed. Most easterners never hear much at all about the old legends concerning the Shields.\" Gryph poured himself another glass of wine. \"What did he say about us?\"\\n\\n Sariana gripped the edge of her writing desk. She was trembling with the force of her emotions. Her voice shook with it. \"He said you Shields have managed to concoct some crazy tale about not being members of the original social classes that arrived on board The Serendipity.\"\\n\\n Gryph shrugged. \"The tale is true.\"\\n\\n \"You expect me to believe that?\"\\n\\n \"No. Not in your present mood. But one of these days you\u0027ll learn the whole story.\" \"I don\u0027t want to learn the whole story. Do you understand? I don\u0027t want any part of it. I don\u0027t want any\\n\\n part of you. I have enough problems in my life without getting involved in some idiotic local legend.\"\\n\\n \"If you had wanted to stay uninvolved with local legends,\" Gryph informed her with a strange smile, \"you shouldn\u0027t have tried to play games with one.\"\\n\\n Sariana gritted her teeth. \"If you\u0027re talking about my using that hypnotic drug to try to make you a little more agreeable - \"\\n\\n \"I am,\" he assured her and took another swallow of wine.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve explained about that. I was desperate.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose I should thank you for using the drug. If you hadn\u0027t tried that, I might never have found you. I wasn\u0027t looking for an eastern wife.\"\\n\\n \"You talk about hunting a wife the way you would hunt wild game!\" Sariana almost lost her voice again.\\n\\n \"Wife hunting is more difficult. But it was time for me to try to find one. It\u0027s not easy for a Shield, you\\n\\n know. The right women are few and far between. Under the terms of the First Generation Pact, a Shield is allowed to search for a mate in any social class, but actually arranging to meet a lot of females from a lot of different classes is another problem. The population was so small back in the eariy days that it was relatively easy to locate a possible mate. The logistics of the situation have changed considerably since then. Clans have learned ways of keeping then-daughters out of sight of a potential Shield husband. It\u0027s difficult to line up a number of women from which to choose. Social conventions have proven more formidable protection for young women than weapons and walls would have done.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-38.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
