{"id":81059,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"Impulsively she had begun trying the warehouse doors she was passing. With each locked door she encountered, the fear crawling through her became stronger.\n On the fifth try she had gotten lucky. The handle of a small side door had turned under her gloved fingers. Sariana hadn\u0027t hesitated. She had dashed inside and closed the door behind her.\n She had found herself in a deep, looming darkness broken by the fitful light of a few, dim vapor lamps set in the walls.\n Now she sat huddled in the deepest shadows she could find. She was sitting on a wine cask. Rank upon rank of barrels and casks were piled in front of her and behind her. The odor of wine was heavy in the air.\n Sariana tried to decide how long she should stay in her hiding place. With any luck whoever had trailed her through the streets would grow weary of the search and seek other prey.\n Then she heard the unmistakable sound of the side door opening and closing again. Sariana shuddered and squeezed her eyes shut briefly against the fear that threatened to overwhelm her. The scarlet-toe hissed its nearly silent hiss and clung tightly to the fabric of Sariana\u0027s cape.\n Sariana opened her eyes and gazed out into the darkness. The beam of a small hand-held vapor lamp was reflected briefly from a far wall. Then it disappeared as whoever held it turned down another aisle. She could hear the scrape of boots on the warehouse floor. Whoever was hunting her was conducting a systematic search of the aisles. Sooner or later he would come down this aisle and she would be trapped.\n Sariana came to a decision. She was not going to crouch there until the inevitable happened. Stealthily she stood up and set down her travel pouches. Then she removed her cloak. The scarlet-toe\n scampered from the cloak to her arm and back up to her shoulder. There it sat poised and ready. The little creature seemed to have come to the same conclusion as Sariana. Anything was better than waiting to be discovered.\n Sariana stepped softly out of her slippers and turned to confront the row of casks behind her. The barrels were stacked only four tiers high in the first row. It shouldn\u0027t bt that difficult to climb to the top tier. Tentatively sht searched for and found handholds and places for her stock inged toes.\n The climb proved harder than she had anticipated. By the time Sariana reached the top tier of casks she was breathing heavily and terrified that the searcher would hear her. Fortunately he was still moving systematically up and down the aisles. It would be a few minutes before he reached the aisle in which she\u0027d left her travel pouches and cloak.\n Sariana glanced around. There was a little more light from the vapor lamps up here. She could see the outlines of the casks on either side of her. Some of the barrels were smaller than others. She made her way cautiously along the curving ribs of the wine casks until she came to a tier of smaller containers that were stacked upright instead of on their sides.\n Experimentally she tried nudging one of the small casks. It proved unexpectedly heavy. She would never be able to lift it, but she might be able to push it.\n The beam of the vapor lamp turned the corner of Sariana\u0027s aisle. She froze, watching in horrified fascination as a figure made his way rapidly along the corridor of wine casks. In another moment he would see the travel pouches and Sariana\u0027s discarded cloak. Sariana held her breath and prepared to use all her strength on the barrel under her hands.\n The man in the aisle gave a grunt of satisfaction when the vapor light picked out Sariana\u0027s possessions on the floor. He hurried forward, swinging the ray of light rapidly back and forth. He never once raised the light to examine the top rows of casks. It was obvious he assumed his quarry was huddled behind a wine barrel.\n \"You can come on out of hiding,\" the man urged, his voice oily with an attempt to coax his prey into the open. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you. Come on now, little lady. It\u0027s all right. Come on out of your hiding place.\"\n Sariana\u0027s fingers trembled on the rim of the upright wine cask. She had to time this perfectly or she would be worse off than she already was.\n Fortunately the searcher paused to examine the travel pouches. He bent over to open the clasps, intent on examining the contents. Sariana gathered herself, felt the scarlet-toe gather itself simultaneously, and then she shoved at the wine cask with all her might. Lucky hissed.\n The man below jerked upright as he heard the scrape of wood on wood. The beam of his light caught the cask as it toppled downward and he cried out in startled anger.\n Sariana watched, frozen in shock as the man tried to throw himself to one side. He was going to dodge the cask, she thought. Frantically she shoved at the next barrel in line and then the one stacked next to it.\n A loud, groaning rumble filled the warehouse as half a dozen small casks of expensive wine went crashing down onto the hard floor. Somewhere in the midst of the noise a man\u0027s scream rose shrilly and then ended with heart-stopping suddenness. The vapor lamp winked out.\n A moment later the last of the cascading barrels rolled to a halt and all was quiet. Moving unsteadily, Sariana climbed down the large casks to the floor below. The scarlet-toe was\n hissing softly again.\n Sariana tripped and nearly fell when her bare toe struck a fallen cask. Stifling an exclamation of pain, she scrambled through the maze of toppled casks, seeking her travel pouches.\n She stumbled over the intruder\u0027s still form first and nearly screamed. But the man did not move. Sariana untangled herself from his short cape and frantically groped for her things. They were splashed with wine. She could smell it in the darkness and feel the dampness under her fingers.\n Shoving her feet back into her slippers, she folded her travel cloak over one arm and grabbed up the pouches.\n \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" she whispered to the scarlet-toe who signaled its agreement with a low grumble. Sariana was intent only on fleeing the warehouse. \"This is all Gryph\u0027s fault. I wouldn\u0027t be in this awful position if it wasn\u0027t for him. And since I am in this mess, you\u0027d think the least he could do would be to come to my rescue. But no, I have to rescue myself. Typical of a man not to be around when you need him. They\u0027re more than ready to hop into bed with a woman but where are they when she\u0027s in trouble?\"\n She was chattering to the scariet-toe out of anxiety, Sariana realized. It was ridiculous. It was a sign of how badly frayed her nerves were.\n Finding the small warehouse door she let herself out onto the street where she struggled to balance her burdens.\n \"We should report this to the town guards,\" she muttered to the lizard. \"But if we stop long enough to do that we\u0027ll never get away.\"\n She hesitated, torn between civic duty and the need to escape. In the end the need to get out of town won. Sariana hurried down the empty street toward the wharf. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-40.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
