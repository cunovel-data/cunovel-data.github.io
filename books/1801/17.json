He took the opportunity to step in with more helpful information.\\n\\n \"They have an affinity for females just as krellcats have an affinity for males.\" \"You\u0027ve seen iny krellcat,\" Luri reminded her. \"This scarlet-toe will want to hang around you the same\\n\\n way my krellcat is always hanging around me.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" Sariana\u0027s voice was very faint. \"Uh, where is your krellcat this moming?\"\\n\\n \"I left him in my room. I was afraid he might eat the scarlet-toe.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" Sariana said again weakly. \"Is this business of keeping krellcats and scarlet-toes for pets an old western custom?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a very old custom,\" Gryph said easily. \"It\u0027s only been in the past few years that anyone discovered what great pets they make.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said a little too cheerfully, \"what an odd coincidence. Recently in my homeland a few people have started keeping odd pets, too. They seem quite attached to them. I never had time for a pet, what with my studies and all.\"\\n\\n Gryph watched her standing there, wet and bedraggled from the storm with a caged lizard she didn\u0027t want in her hands and he didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or offer comfort. He had the feeling she would be infuriated by either approach.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s an old Serendipity saying that fits occasions such as this,\" Gryph finally said blandly. \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked with deep suspicion.\\n\\n \"Take what you can get when you can get it. Life doesn\u0027t come with any guarantees.\"\\n\\n \"Sayings like that cover a lot of territory, don\u0027t they?\" she retorted.\\n\\n \"Do you really like the lizard, Sariana?\" Luri asked, eager for more enthusiastic appreciation of his gift. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" she said with an obvious sincerity that surprised Gryph. \"The most beautiful lizard I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\\n\\n Luri looked bashfully pleased. \"I\u0027m glad you like it. Now you\u0027ll have to think of a name for it.\" \"I think I\u0027ll call it Lucky Break,\" Sariana said, slanting Glyph a dangerous look from the comer of her\\n\\n eye. \"Lucky for short. Thank you, Luri. Now I think I\u0027d better go and change my clothes. I\u0027ll see you at dinner.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bring a supply of leaves to your room so you can feed Lucky,\" Luri promised. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Luck of the day, Sariana,\" Gryph said cheerfully as she turned to go.\\n\\n \"Thank you. Lord Chassyh.\" She didn\u0027t glance back but her tone was excruciatingly formal. \"If my luck gets any better than it is already, I may have to consider increasing my insurance coverage.\" She vanished down the hall in a swish of wet, gray skirts. Her hands were filled with scarlet and gold.\\n\\n When she had gone, Luri turned back to Gryph, his expression delighted. \"I think the scarlet-toe will make her less homesick, don\u0027t you? Especially at night.\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think she\u0027s especially homesick at night?\" Gryph asked curiously. Luri shrugged. \"A couple of times I\u0027ve seen her walking in the conservatory after everyone else has\\n\\n gone to bed. I sneak out of my room sometimes to check the pond for baby moonfish. When they\u0027re small, they only come out from under the rocks at night, you know. Anyhow, as I was going by the conservatory hall I saw Sariana. The first time I saw her I thought she was a ghost. I was almost scared.\"\\n\\n \"What made you think she was a ghost?\"\\n\\n \"She was wearing a white night robe and she was just sort of drifting through the plants and trees. She didn\u0027t make a sound. It was the only time I\u0027ve ever seen her with her hair down. She looked a little sad. I almost went in and spoke to her, but I was afraid she would be embarrassed. Mother says easterners don\u0027t like to have other people see them when they\u0027re sad.\"\\n\\n \"Your mother is probably right. Easterners like to pretend they don\u0027t have emotions like the rest of us.\" \"Why?\"\\n\\n Gryph shrugged. \"Maybe it makes them feel superior.\"\\n\\n Luri lost interest in that subject. \"Well, now she\u0027ll have the scarlet-toe to keep her company at night.\" \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll enjoy it, Luri.\" Glyph\u0027s mouth curved faintly. \"I just hope the scarlet-toe realizes how\\n\\n lucky it is.\"\\n\\n Chapter 4\\n\\n At midnight that night, Gryph stood silently beneath the fronds of a huge, sprawling hydra palm and\\n\\n watched the white-robed figure glide soundlessly through the conservatory.\\n\\n Luri was right, Sariana did look a little like a ghost. But this was no creature made of transparent, untouchable vapor. Gryph knew the lady moving toward him on velvet slippered feet would probably resist the touch of his calloused hand, but that didn\u0027t mean she couldn\u0027t be grasped and held.\\n\\n He had given the matter a great deal of thought since his first encounter with Sariana and he knew he had reached a turning point in his life. In courting Sariana he would be seeking to alter his own future and hers. Not an easy task.\\n\\n It would be more of a hunt than a courtship, he figured;\\n\\n the most demanding kind of hunting he had ever done. Chasing bandits was much simpler than courting Sariana was going to be. Everything was against him. He was from the wrong continent and the wrong social class. On top of that he got the impression she didn\u0027t even like him very much. Oh, she was aware of him, all right. He was sure of that. But that didn\u0027t mean she liked him. Dealing with him was a necessary bit of unpleasantness she was willing to endure in order to reach her goal.\\n\\n But every time he saw her a jolt of shuddering awareness went through him. The sensation was nothing as simple and straightforward as lust. That he could have handled one way or another. Instead, it was an acute, indescribable hunger that poured through his entire body like hot rain. It was different from normal sexual desire, more powerful, more complex and, therefore, more dangerous.\\n\\n The driving need had been born within him the night he had awakened, mind spinning from the drug, and focused on the woman who had dared to touch his weapon kit. Even unmated and unlinked with him, she\u0027d had the power to reach him in some manner. She hadn\u0027t even been aware of what was happening. It had all taken place on a very subtle level. An untuned mind such as Sariana\u0027s would not have understood the tendrils of awareness that had pulled him out of his drugged haze.\\n\\n The powerful emotions that had been incited in that moment had been steadily gaining strength since then. Kissing Sariana two mornings ago had done nothing to alleviate the growing need within Gryph. It had only fed it, making it more powerful and demanding. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-17.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
