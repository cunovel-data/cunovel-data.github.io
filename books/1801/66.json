He\u0027s sending for backup support from the frontier provinces, but it will be a long time coining. I\u0027m not sure we have that much time. He and I decided I\u0027d better start the search for the ship now and let the others catch up with me.\"\\n\\n \"You could ask for help from my people,\" she pointed out stubbornly.\\n\\n \"Sariana,\" he said as patiently as he could, \"the other social classes must never know that such a thing as controlling the weapons is even theoretically possible for a Shield.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Use your head! My people are a very small minority among yours. We\u0027re tolerated because we have a history of having helped the colonists and because we\u0027re useful as mercenaries and bandit hunters. We are also tolerated because we\u0027ve always abided by the terms of the Pact. People trust us.\"\\n\\n \"In other words, you have been tolerated because you are seen as loyal warriors, not a potential\\n\\n threat,\" she concluded.\\n\\n \"What do you think would happen if it became known that a Shield might be able to use the power of the crystal ships to control everyone on this planet?\"\\n\\n Sariana took a long time mulling that one over. \"I see your point,\" she admitted finally. \"You walk a narrow line, don\u0027t you, Gryph? You must keep people in awe of you if you are to maintain your secrets, yet you can\u0027t risk having the populace learn to fear you. If people knew how dangerous your kind could be, they might decide they would be safer without you around.\"\\n\\n \"The system has worked reasonably well since the First Generation. The last thing any Shield wants is war between our class and the other classes.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"So now you have to hunt down this rogue Shield before he activates the crystal ship weapons you believe he\u0027s found.\"\\n\\n \"Or before some outsider discovers there is such a thing as a rogue Shield.\" \"You think the ship is somewhere in this gorge?\" Sariana asked.\\n\\n He rubbed the back of his neck and took a couple of steps closer to her. She was being a little too businesslike about this whole thing, he decided. He couldn\u0027t tell exactly how she was reacting behind that thoughtful facade. If she was experiencing any strong emotions she was rapidly learning how to conceal mem from him. He wanted to pull her into his arms and prove to himself that she still wanted him in spite of everything he had just told her, but he had a hunch this wasn\u0027t the time.\\n\\n \"According to the records, the last weapon ships discovered were found around here. The Shields thought they had cleaned out the area but it\u0027s difficult to sack prisma in this kind of country. Certain kinds of rock can get in the way of a Shield\u0027s ability to focus on the light radiation prisma produces. Today I start hunting.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve tracked weapon ships before?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he admitted. \"Not real ones. I told you, the last ship was found before I was born. But I\u0027ve been trained to work prisma.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027do you do it?\" she asked curiously.\\n\\n He smiled wryly. \"It\u0027s a little like the first link with a Shieldmate. Except that there\u0027s no passion involved. I use the lock on my weapon kit and sort of, well, tune myself, I guess you would say.\" \"I see. You had better get busy then, hadn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He narrowed his eyes and wondered again what the hell she was thinking. \"Sariana?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\" She turned toward him expectantly.\\n\\n \"Never mind. You\u0027re right. I\u0027d better get busy.\"\\n\\n He spent the afternoon seeking prisma as they cruised slowly through the awesome gorge. One hand on his lock, his mind concentrated to the point of pain, Gryph focused on the unique kind of disturbance a ship full of prisma weapons created. It wasn\u0027t easy finding one of the small crystal ships, he had been told by experts from his father\u0027s generation. It took time and patience. The problem was he didn\u0027t have a lot of either.\\n\\n \"Maybe your weapon kit lock isn\u0027t strong enough to do the job under the kind of conditions you\u0027re encountering in this gorge,\" Sariana suggested that evening as they finished setting up camp.\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" Gryph sat gazing into the fire and wondered what he was going to do if he couldn\u0027t locate the weapon ship. \"I wish I knew how much time I\u0027ve got to track it. Whoever took that cutter could be getting into the ship right now. I should have brought Delek with me instead of sending him for help.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because two Shields could cover more territory than one working alone.\" Sariana stroked the scarlet-toe curled in her lap. She was eyeing his weapon kit. \"Something about\\n\\n that kit of yours has interested me from the beginning.\"\\n\\n His mouth tilted. \"I remember the night you took it off me. It fascinated you.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t help myself. I wanted to examine it more closely. Unfortunately, you woke up before I could look inside.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have been able to open it at that point. You had to be tuned to it by me. That\u0027s what happened the night we went to bed together the first time. The next morning you were able to open it and prove you were my - \" he broke off before he said wife.\\n\\n \"And I haven\u0027t wanted to touch it since,\" she said wryly. \"But I find I\u0027m curious about it again tonight.\"\\n\\n Gryph watched her closely for a long while. \"You want to open the kit?\"\\n\\n She got up and put the lizard on her shoulder. Then she circled the fire and sat down beside him. Gryph slowly unsnapped the kit and handed it to her. He felt an odd tingling sensation when she took it\\n\\n from him. She put the kit in her lap and examined it intently.\\n\\n Gryph experienced another wave of the tingling sensation. He shook his head to clear it. Sariana touched the lock, her silvered nails moving lightly over it.\\n\\n Gryph was suddenly filled with a strange urgency. He was getting odd impressions in his head, the kind of filtered light he saw when he had first learned to work prisma.\\n\\n Sariana stroked the lock with a lover\u0027s touch and Glyph drew a deep breath. He reached for her free hand.\\n\\n \"Think of light,\" he whispered. \"Think of light in all its different colors. Think of a beam of white light broken out into a hundred million rays, each slightly different than the one next to it. Follow the spectrum into the range where the colors have no names. Look at the colors you can\u0027t see with your eyes. You can see them with your mind. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I think so.\" Her voice shook.\\n\\n \"Now look for the colors in that range that have a certain pulse.\" Gryph realized he was holding onto Sariana with a savage grip.\\n\\n Her eyes were closed and she had gone rigid with unnatural tension. Her fingers were frozen on the lock. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-66.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
