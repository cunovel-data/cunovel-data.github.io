{"id":81052,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Obviously she had decided on the approach she was going to use to deal with her problem. She was going to try to pretend nothing had happened. Gryph admired her spirit even while he was forced to struggle with his own temper.\\n\\n Automatically he touched the lock on his weapon kit, remembering the passion and pain and the unbreakable bond that had been forged during the night. Then he thought about Brinton dying in that alley because another Shield wanted the prisma cutter. Gryph had no choice. There was no time to continue the wooing process. He could not afford to wait on the convenience of his nervous bride. If she thought she could interview him later in her office and discuss their relationship at some unspecified time in the future, she had a surprise coming.\\n\\n He bad tried to do this quietly and in private, but she had refused to listen to him. She was bent, as usual, on having everyming her own way. To that end she was endeavoring to use her first major line of defense, her glib tongue. Her lack of fear of him was almost laughable. She still had no idea how indulgent be was being with her. She still did not know that under the law, her fate had been sealed last night.\\n\\n Gryph did not like untenable, unresolved situations. It was his nature to face matters and settle them. Perhaps the easiest, fastest and surest method of handling this situation was to force Sariana to face reality.\\n\\n Sariana swept into the breakfast room and realized just how late she was running when she saw the Avylyns already gathered for the meal. Five silvery blond beads turned toward her and five pairs of dark eyes took in the grim look on the face of the man striding through the doorway behind her.\\n\\n \"The luck of the day to all of you,\" Sariana said with all the cheerfulness she could manage. No one in the room could imagine how much effort it took. Her normally strong self-control was very shaky. She didn\u0027t quite trust any of her emotions or feelings. She had known the moment she opened her door and found Gryph on the other side that life had suddenly become precarious.\\n\\n The only positive thing she could find in the situation was that she was becoming accustomed to the unpredictability of her life these days. Nothing had been straightforward or predictable since the day she had learned she had failed to make the cut at the academy. The only thing she could do was hold on to her self-control. At times it seemed that it was all she had left.\\n\\n The Avylyns made the proper greetings and then burst into exuberant chatter as they discussed the success of their annual ball.\\n\\n \"It came off superbly,\" Lady Avylyn chortled with great delight. \"I was just telling Jasso that we were right not to stint this year. Not a soul suspected that we might be having a few trifling financial problems.\"\\n\\n Lord Jasso nodded his head in satisfaction. \"Quite so. You were right, my dear. Everyone was most impressed, I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n \"Well I, for one, had a wonderful time,\" Mara proclaimed, her eyes darting to Gryph\u0027s face as if to be certain he had registered her comment. Sariana realized the younger woman was slightly miffed about Gryph\u0027s lack of interest in being socially introduced to her friends and acquaintances. Sariana also suspected that Mara had developed a rather deep curiosity about the Shield.\\n\\n \"You always have a good time as long as you dance every dance,\" Bryer told his sister. \"I didn\u0027t see you sitting on the sidelines,\" his mother said with a complacent smile. \"You did a turn with\\n\\n every young lady in the room.\"\\n\\n Bryer grinned. \"What did you expect? I was merely full-filling my responsibilities as a host.\" Luri spoke up. \"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so great about dancing. Waste of time if you ask me.\" The yellow-eyed krellcat, Luri\u0027s constant companion, yawned in agreement and tucked its furry,\\n\\n sinuous body into a more comfortable position on the boy\u0027s arm. The small creature eyed Lucky with surreptitious interest, but apparently decided hunting would not be permitted at the breakfast table. The cat went back to dozing.\\n\\n \"Give yourself a few more years, Luri. You\u0027ll change your mind,\" his brother said. Luri opened his mouth to respond, but his attention was distracted by the lizard on Sariana\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"Hey, you really like the scarlet-toe, huh, Sariana? I knew you would once you got to know it better. I told you they make great pets.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky seems to have adopted me,\" Sariana said, examining the contents of the serving dishes. \"I feel guilty leaving it in the cage now. The poor thing always looks so forlorn when I leave it behind.\" She helped herself to a cup of tea and a breakfast muffin and politely ignored Gryph when he sat down across from her.\\n\\n \"Did you have a good time last night, Sariana?\" Mara asked with a direct look. \"I saw you earlier in the evening but lost track of you later.\"\\n\\n \"You know I tend to keep earlier hours man the rest of you,\" Sariana said. She sipped tea with careful restraint, aware that Gryph was helping himself to large portions from each of the bowls.\\n\\n \"Sariana!\" Lady Avylyn gave her a scolding glance. \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me you went to bed early last night? What about your friend Etion Rakken? He was looking forward to dancing with you again.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that Rakken knew what he was missing,\" Jasso said with a knowing smirk. \"The banker was as drunk as a keenshee bird in a gullberry patch by the time the ball ended.\"\\n\\n \"As it happens I had business to attend to last night,\" Sariana said. \"Business I think we should discuss right after breakfast. If you would all be so kind as to come to my office as soon as we finish here, I would appreciate it.\"\\n\\n \"Business,\" Mara repeated with a groan. \"Who wants to talk about business this morning? I want to talk about the ball.\"\\n\\n Lord Avylyn gave his business manager a sharp look. \"Does this concern the cutter?\" Gryph answered before Sariana could speak. \"The prisma cutter has become Shield business.\" Everyone turned to stare at him, including Sariana who didn\u0027t have the least idea of what he was\\n\\n talking about. It was obvious his words meant something to the Avylyns. They looked distinctly startled.\\n\\n \"Shield business?\" Jasso exclaimed. \"But how? Why? I don\u0027t understand. That cutter has always belonged to the Avylyns. Our family has held it since the first crystal was sold to us.\"\\n\\n \"Calm yourself, Lord Avylyn,\" Gryph said. \"When the cutter is found, it will be returned to your family. I meant only that locating the cutter is now a Shield matter. I will pursue it for Shield purposes and when I find it, I will give it to you. I just want it clear that there is no longer any question of my working for anyone else in this matter.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-33.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
