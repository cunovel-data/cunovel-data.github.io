Furthermore, as you just noted, he\u0027s a westerner,\" she added with a weak\n smile. \"You can\u0027t count on him to apply logic or reason to the situation. If he\u0027s decided you\u0027re no longer useful to him as a businessman or partner, then I\u0027d say he won\u0027t hesitate to get rid of you. But first he\u0027ll kill Gryph because he knows that of all of us, Gryph poses the only real danger to him.\"\n Something crumpled inside Rakken. His growing anxiety blossomed visibly as he surged to his feet. It was as if he had suddenly given up trying to reassure himself that he was still in command of the situation.\n \"I\u0027m not so sure Chassyn is much of a danger to him,\" Rakken announced morosely. \"You didn\u0027t see the confrontation between the two of mem that I witnessed early this rooming. Targyn did something to Chassyn with his mind. Stopped him cold. I got the impression Chassyn barely survived the encounter. I wouldn\u0027t have believed it if I hadn\u0027t seen it with my own eyes. Taigyn\u0027s been bragging about how \u0027strong\u0027 he\u0027s gotten since he\u0027s worked with the prisma hidden here, but I hadn\u0027t realized just what he meant. Damn it to the Lightstorm, Sariana, what are we going to do?\"\n \"We have to set Gryph free so he can deal with Targyn before the man gets any stronger!\" Sariana tried to keep her tone calm and forceful. This was a time for coolheaded, businesslike reasoning and persuasion. She didn\u0027t want to panic Rakken further, but at the same time she needed to push him in the direction she wanted him to go. Time was running out.\n \"What good is Chassyn going to be to us without that damn weapon kit?\" Rakken muttered as he downed the remainder of his wine. \"Even with the kit Targyn nearly killed him using some strange mental power. For some reason Targyn doesn\u0027t seem to be able to use his mind against normal people. At least not yet.\"\n \"We don\u0027t have much choice. Targyn might not be able to use his mind against us the way you say he did with Gryph, but you\u0027ve admitted yourself that he\u0027s a trained warrior. What are chances of escaping without Gryph?\"\n \"About zero,\" Rakken admitted. \"Especially when you consider that there are three bandits working with Targyn. Miscroft might not be much of a problem. I\u0027ve been talking to him on the side and we\u0027ve almost decided to make a deal. He\u0027d probably listen to reason. But the other two are definitely Targyn\u0027s men. Any one of the three is far more skilled with a blade bow or a knife than you or I could ever hope to be.\"\n \"All the more reason to find Gryph and set him free.\" Sariana paused as a familiar feeling tickled her mind. It was the sort of feeling she\u0027d had earlier just before the image of the blade knife had slipped into her consciousness. This time there was a fleeting sense of urgency, an insistent command that she find Gryph. Then the image of a corridor flickered in her head.\n \"Sariana?\" Rakken eyed her worriedly. \"What is it?\"\n \"We have to find Gryph. Now.\" She turned toward the door. At the last instant she stopped, remembering Lucky. She snatched up the cloak and headed back to the door.\n \"Sariana, wait! We have to talk about this further.\" Rakken leaped after her. \"There might be a way for you and me to escape if we make some plans.\"\n \"There\u0027s no time left,\" Sariana said as she stepped into the metal corridor. \"I have to get to Gryph.\" \"Damn that man. Sariana, you\u0027re putting far too much faith in him. He\u0027s useless to us without that\n weapon kit, and I no longer have it.\"\n She whirled on him, her voice a tight whisper. \"Please be quiet, Etion. One of Targyn\u0027s men might hear us. Do you know where Gryph is being held?\"\n Etion paused and then nodded bleakly toward a branching corridor. \"Down that hall. There\u0027s a door on the left.\"\n \"Locked?\"\n \"Of course it\u0027s locked. Do you think Targyn would keep Chassyn in an unlocked cell?\" \"Let\u0027s go.\" Sariana hurried down the hall, scanning the blank walls for some sign of a door. Rakken,\n apparently unable to think of any other course of action, followed.\n \"There,\" he muttered, pointing to an intricate locking device affixed to a western style door. There was a grill at the top of the door. \"Targyn said he might need a chamber for prisoners, but he couldn\u0027t figure out how to lock and unlock the metal doors in this place. This room didn\u0027t have a door so he had his men build this one and installed it in the opening.\"\n \"Targyn\u0027s got the only key, I suppose?\"\n Rakken nodded wordlessly.\n \"Sariana.\" Gryph\u0027s voice was a bare thread of sound from the other side of the grill. Sariana\u0027s heart leaped. \"Gryph! We\u0027re here, but the door\u0027s locked and Etion doesn\u0027t have a key.\"\n \"Then you\u0027ll just have to pick the lock, won\u0027t you?\" Gryph asked mildly.\n \"Don\u0027t sound so damn casual,\" Sariana said tightly. \"I have no more idea of how to pick a lock than I do of how to fly.\"\n \"No problem. I\u0027ll guide you through the whole process. All you have to do is pay attention and follow instructions. Got that cloak pin I gave you?\"\n Sariana blinked and glanced down. \"I\u0027ve got it. What about it?\"\n \"Listen closely and do exactly as I say. I looked at the lock on the way in. It\u0027s pretty standard. Targyn probably didn\u0027t have time to have anything special made up. Take the pin and slide it along the seal that joins the two halves together.\"\n Sariana pulled the pin from the cloak she was carrying and went to work. It was a tedious process and Gryph lost his patience more than once. He wasn\u0027t the only impatient male in the vicinity, Sariana noted. Rakken was pacing in a circle in the corridor behind her, muttering dire predictions of disaster.\n \"Damn it, Sariana,\" Gryph snapped at one point when she failed to probe the lock spring. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Can\u0027t you even follow a few simple orders?\"\n \"Gryph, I\u0027m trying. Explain the last sequence once more.\"\n Rakken glanced at her, his eyes feverish with anxiety. \"Hurry up, Sariana. If you can\u0027t do it, just say so and drop the whole thing. We might still be able to get out of here.\"\n \"Shut up,\" Sariana said absently as she frowned in concentration. \"Both of you.\" She jiggled the cloak\n pin.\n Gryph ran through the description of the next step, his voice taut and controlled. Sariana tried again and failed to find the hidden spring. \"Damn westerners,\" she mumbled under her\n breath, \"too clever for their own good.\"\n Rakken walked over to breathe down her neck. \"Did you get it this time?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t get it this time. Gryph, you\u0027ll have to describe it again. I can\u0027t find the spring.\" \"Sariana, any child could have released that spring by now,\" he said roughly. \"Then go find yourself a child,\" she retorted, losing patience. \"Listen to me, both of you.
