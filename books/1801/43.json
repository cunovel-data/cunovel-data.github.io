I\u0027m talking about sex, damn it. Pure, simple, straightforward sex. You were no virgin, Gryph Chassyn,\" Sariana accused.\n \"I\u0027m supposed to apologize for that, too?\"\n She glared at his profile, uncertain of his mood. \"Are you laughing at me?\" He shook his head quickly. \"No. I swear I\u0027m not. I\u0027m just realizing that there was a slight\n communication problem that night and you got the wrong impression. For that I apologize.\" He made a sweeping gesture with one hand. \"Hell, I apologize for everything about the clumsy way I handled our first night together. If anything, my bungling should prove just how inexperienced I was. I wasn\u0027t any more prepared for the crossover effect than you were.\"\n \"What is all this nonsense about a crossover effect?\" Sariana demanded. \"It\u0027s what happens when a Shield and his Shieldmate make love.\"\n Sariana\u0027s eyes widened as she remembered the explosion of pain and passion and the way she had\n seemed to be absorbing everything he had been feeling that night as well as her own jumble of sensations.\n \"You\u0027re telling me I wasn\u0027t just hallucinating because of all that punch I drank?\" she asked weakly. \"You weren\u0027t hallucinating,\" he assured her softly. \"We were linked and you were picking up on my\n feelings as well as your own. Unfortunately, I wasn\u0027t in great shape that night. My shoulder hurt, I was running a fever and I was still recovering from the effects of the medic\u0027s anesthetic. To finish it off, there was the unavoidable discomfort that comes from tuning into the prisma the first time. Poor Sariana. You had enough new sensations of your own to deal with that night. I\u0027m sorry you got hit with everything I was feeling and the prisma, too.\"\n Sariana stared at him in openmouthed amazement. \"You mean you go through that every time you make love to a woman?\"\n \"Of course not,\" he said impatiently. \"Haven\u0027t you been listening? It\u0027s only like that between a Shield and his Shieldmate. It doesn\u0027t happen with other women. And from what I\u0027ve been told, it isn\u0027t supposed to be that bad between a Shield and his lady, either. What happened between us was very strong, Sariana. I\u0027m not sure I understand all of it even though I\u0027ve thought about it a lot since then. But I\u0027m sure we can control it.\"\n \"Wait a minute. Are you telling me that you have been to bed with other women but it\u0027s never been like that with any of them?\"\n He smiled slightly. \"I told you, you\u0027re my Shieldmate. There\u0027s been no other for me. I\u0027ve never been married before. A Shield can\u0027t link with just any female, you see. Given several thousand women to choose from, a man would be very lucky to find even a few who had the potential of linking with a Shield. And even then there are likely to be other complications.\"\n \"Such as?\" She couldn\u0027t believe she was hearing this, but Sariana couldn\u0027t bring herself to believe Gryph was lying, either. One thing was certain: He believed what he was saying. Westerners loved legends.\n \"Such as the fact that the woman in question might not be interested in going to bed with a Shield. Or she might be past childbearing age. Or she might already be married to a man from her own class in which case the Pact forbids the Shield from approaching her.\" Gryph\u0027s smile twisted wryly. \"The First Generation colonists drove a shrewd bargain.\"\n Sariana seized on the one point that applied to her. \"You mean if the woman doesn\u0027t want to marry the Shield she\u0027s free to say no?\"\n \"You weren\u0027t listening. As usual. For a bright woman, Sariana, you have an odd tendency to hear only what you want to hear. I said the woman is free to choose whether or not she wants to go to bed with the Shield. Once she\u0027s been to bed with him, she\u0027s married. Unless, for some reason, the link didn\u0027t work.\" His eyes grew very brilliant. \"But there is no question of that in our case. We are linked, Sariana. One of these days you\u0027ll admit it to yourself and to me.\"\n She instinctively took a step backward, even though he hadn\u0027t moved. \"Why is it so important toâ€¦ to link with a woman? You admitted you don\u0027t need to be linked in order to have a sexual relationship.\"\n \"There are two reasons why a Shield searches very hard for a woman with whom he can link,\" Gryph said evenly. \"The first is that he cannot father a child with any woman except a true Shieldmate. All other unions are sterile. And even with a Shieldmate, he can only produce sons. No Shield has ever fathered a daughter. The future of every Shield clan is dependent on the sons finding mates among the descendants of the colonists of The Serendipity.\"\n Sariana stared at him. \"You\u0027re telling me the legend is true? Your class was not among those on board\n The Serendipityr\n Gryph lifted his head proudly. \"My people were conveniently on hand when the lightstorm took The Serendipity. Without my ancestors, everyone on that ship would have died. We saved them. We saved them a second time on the ground. Someday I\u0027ll tell you the whole story. The important point is that the colonists repaid the Shields by negotiating the Pact. It binds us into their social system.\"\n \"This is all just a legend. A wild tale concocted by the people of the western provinces. I know it is.\" \"You know I\u0027m not lying to you, Sariana. Look at me. I have never lied to you.\" For a moment she was trapped by the truth in his eyes. She struggled to resist and became frantic\n when she could not. Without a word she spun around, seeking escape.\n \"Sariana.\"\n She stopped but did not turn back to face him. She did not dare.\n \"You haven\u0027t heard the second reason why a Shield will go to any length to find a mate,\" Gryph said. \"What\u0027s the second reason?\" But silently she was thinking that she did not want to hear it. The answer\n was already in her head. It had appeared there as if by magic.\n \"The second reason is that if he does not find a mate, a Shield will face a kind of loneliness no one else can even begin to comprehend. He\u0027ll know he has missed the special communication that comes through linking with a woman. He\u0027ll face it all the days of his life and when that life is over he will also face the knowledge that he has left nothing of himself to the future. Now do you see why I can\u0027t let you go, Sariana?\"\n Chapter 10\n SEVERAL hours later Sariana lay alone in the large ship\u0027s bunk. She was wide awake and very thoughtful. It had been a long while since she had shared an early dinner with Gryph and the handful of other passengers on board the windrigger. She had retired to the cabin prepared to stage a determined battle when her so-called husband came to claim his marital rights. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-43.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
