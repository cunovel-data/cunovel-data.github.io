This is the way it was meant to be for both of us.\" His hand went to his belt and he tore off the remainder of his clothing. In the pale light Sariana saw the full, hard length of his manhood and she shivered. He was taut and heavy with need and her own body responded to it even as she watched him with an awed, questioning gaze. Gryph saw the expression in her eyes as she lay looking up at him. He lowered himself quickly back down beside her \"You must not fear me. Shield Lady. You and I are right for each other. I have never been where I am going to take you right now, but I\u0027ve heard others describe it. It will seem strange at first. I am told there is some discomfort, but we\u0027ll face it together. Do you understand?\" Sariana was feeling oddly dizzy. For a moment she wasn\u0027t certain if she heard him say the words or if she only imagined the reassuring sentences inside her head. Then she brushed aside the odd sensation and smiled at him with a tenderness that seemed to dazzle him. His confession was sweet and kind and endeared him to her as nothing else could have done in that moment. \"You\u0027ve never done this before, either?\" she asked softly. He shook his head, his eyes never leaving hers. His rough hand slid over her br**sts. Her already aroused ni**les became firm, tight, incredibly sensitive. \"Never,\" Gryph admitted. \"I had almost decided it would never happen for me.\" \"Oh, Gryph, I\u0027m so glad.\" Sariana hugged him quickly, her delighted words spilling out in a rush. \"I\u0027m so glad this is all new to you, too, although\u0027 I would never have guessed. You seem so sure of yourself. I can\u0027t imagine a man your age and with your obvious… your very bold…\" She paused to find the words, \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought that a man with your impressive physical attributes would have denied himself the pleasures of sex all these years. Men are usually so eager for that kind of thing. Even in the eastern provinces where people are so much more self-controlled it would be unusual for a man to remain celibate this long. Is it the custom in your class for the men to remain virgin until they reach your age?\" Gryph blinked as if he were having trouble following the conversation. His hand stilled on her breast. \"Uh, Sariana, I don\u0027t think you quite understand what I\u0027m trying to explain.\" \"It\u0027s all right,\" she reassured him quickly. She could guess the cause of his awkwardness. His male ego was probably already berating him for the confession. \"I do understand. Men hate to admit they have little or up sexual experience. But I want you to know I\u0027m very touched that we can explore this and learn about it together. You\u0027ve made me very happy. Now I know I won\u0027t have to feel like the only novice in this bed. We\u0027ll be true equals. It\u0027s such a relief to know we\u0027re starting out together.\" A look that might have been either frustration or anguish tightened Gryph\u0027s already stark features. \"Sariana - \" \"Don\u0027t worry, I would never have guessed that you lack experience,\" she said hastily. \"You\u0027re doing beautifully.\" \"Thank you,\" he muttered tightly. \"I guess you have good instincts,\" she went on encouragingly. \"You seem to know exactly where and how to touch me. You\u0027re moving a little too quickly, but I understand why now. All the same, let\u0027s slow down a little. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not nearly as adept as you at figuring all this out. But I want to do the right things, too. Tell me where you want me to touch you.\" Experimentally she trailed her fingertips down over the hard planes of his bu**ocks. \"Do you like that?\" \"Sariana, you\u0027re doing great. But would you mind very much just closing your mouth?\" Her delighted enthusiasm faded. She looked up at Gryph uncertainly, her eyes widening with hurt. He groaned and brushed her lips with his own. \"I\u0027m sorry. Shield Lady. I didn\u0027t mean to offend you. Hell, I\u0027m going to make a mess of this yet if I don\u0027t close my own mouth.\" She sensed his genuine contrition and her feelings were instantly mended. She brushed her fingers gently through his hair, aware that he was very tense. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" she said soothingly. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s perfectly natural for you to be suffering a certain amount of performance anxiety. After all, this is your first time, too. You mustn\u0027t expect too much of yourself.\" He made a slight choking sound. \"Do you ever run out of words, Sariana?\" She smiled mistily. \"Am I chattering? Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m nervous.\" \"I think you\u0027re right,\" he announced gravely. \"We\u0027re both nervous. The only solution is to get it over with,\" he said harshly, decisively. He moved his hand down her silken stomach to the triangle of hair above her thighs. Sariana stirred beneath the exciting touch. The urgency that was controlling Gryph seemed to have gotten a grip on her, too. She could feel the driving force in him and knew an answering force within herself. When his hand went lower still, she cried out softly. Instinctively she pressed her thighs together. \"Let me touch you. Shield Lady,\" Gryph said against her mouth. \"Open your legs for me and let me feel your warmth. I want to be sure you\u0027re ready for me so that I can claim my rights as your true mate.\" She did as he asked and then trembled in excitement as he found the soft skin of her inner thighs. \"Gryph\" Gryph drank his name from her lips. His body trembled against hers as he slipped his rough fingertips into the delicate, hidden folds between her legs. Sariana knew she was dampening his hand. She hoped he didn\u0027t mind. \"You\u0027re as hot as I am,\" he muttered in husky wonderment. \"I can feel your beat. You\u0027re wet and warm and you want me, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, oh, yes, Gryph.\" She twisted against his hand. She wondered if she should be embarrassed by her body\u0027s ungoverned response, but then she realized Gryph was glorying in it. He was taut with his own reaction to her. \"Sariana,\" he began thickly, \"listen to me carefully. I have to ask you something and you must answer truthfully. Do you understand? I\u0027m honor bound to put these questions to you.\" Sariana moved her head restlessly on the pillow. \"I swear I have no diseases and… and I don\u0027t think I\u0027m likely to get pregnant. Earlier this evening I was figuring out the timing of my monthly cycles and I\u0027m sure I\u0027m safe tonight. I\u0027ve discussed such things with other women and I\u0027ve heard that as long as I - \" \"Sariana.\" She opened her eyes, startled by his impatience. \"Yes, Gryph?\" \"One of these days we\u0027re going to have to do something about your unfortunate tendency to talk at the wrong times,\" Gryph said explosively. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re in excellent health. So am I. And as for your getting pregnant - \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-28.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
