It\u0027s difficult to train a young boy in the ways of the Shields while living in a city or town.\" Gryph stood up and reached for his jacket. \"Too many distractions.\"\n \"Why doesn\u0027t Delek have any children?\"\n Gryph gave her a straight, blunt look as he fastened the plain buttons of his short jacket. \"Delek and his lady, Alana, are not linked. She doesn\u0027t have the potential to be a Shieldmate, therefore the relationship is sterile.\"\n Sariana stared at him in astonishment. \"But Delek lives with her?\"\n \"He\u0027s lived with her for years.\"\n \"You mean Shields sometimes get seriously involved with women with whom they don\u0027t believe they can, uh, link?\"\n \"It\u0027s rare,\" Gryph said quietly, \"but occasionally it happens. Sometimes a man just gives up the search for a Shieldmate. Sometimes a Shield loses his mate through death or adultery and he doesn\u0027t have the heart or interest to search for another, so he settles for a relationship that promises companionship or love. That\u0027s what Delek did.\"\n \"Love.\" Sariana went very still, her mind whirling as she absorbed this new information. \"A Shield might fall in love with a woman even though she isn\u0027t a Shieldmate?\"\n Gryph smiled wryly. \"Haven\u0027t you lived in Serendipity long enough to know that love doesn\u0027t always respect custom, law or social traditions?\"\n Sariana traced the intricate details of a massive reptilian head that had been carved into the bunk\u0027s headboard. \"But if a Shield finds a mate with whom he thinks he can link - \"\n \"It\u0027s not a question of thinking he can link with her,\" Gryph said impatiently. \"He either can or can\u0027t. The link isn\u0027t a function of a man\u0027s imagination. It\u0027s very real. A Shield knows almost as soon as he meets a woman whether or not he can mate with her. One of these days you\u0027ll understand that.\"\n Sariana focused her attention outside the window again and prepared to pursue her next question with quiet determination. She had to know the answer, she realized. \"All right, I won\u0027t argue that right now.\"\n \"That\u0027s a relief.\"\n Sariana lost her temper for a few seconds. \"What I want to know is whether or not Shields ever marry for love. Or does thisâ€¦ this linking eventually create love between a Shield and his mate?\"\n There was a heartbeat of silence behind her. Then Gryph answered coolly. \"Do easterners ever marry for love?\"\n Sariana swallowed uncomfortably. \"Rarely.\"\n \"They usually marry for business reasons, right?\" Gryph persisted.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well, Shields many for business reasons, too. In our case, the business is that of ensuring the survival of the next generation. Love is not an essential factor in that business. Sometimes it\u0027s present, sometimes it\u0027s not.\"\n Sariana swung around to confront him. \"But what about the passion that comes with this linking thing?\" \"What about it?\" Gryph replied offhandedly. \"Linked sex is usually great sex for both people\n concerned. That kind of passion can form a strong bond between them. But that hasn\u0027t got anything to do with love. Don\u0027t tell me a sophisticated easterner like you doesn\u0027t know that passion can exist without love? An interesting, passionate relationship without the complications of love was exactly what you planned to have with me when you made the decision to start an affair, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n He was taunting her and Sariana was suddenly furious. It was all she could do to keep a grasp on her selfcontrol. What she really longed to do was pick up her slipper and hurt it at him. For an instant the satisfying image of Gryph ducking the small projectile was very vivid in her head.\n Gryph held up a hand. He gazed briefly at the slippers lying beside the bunk. When he lifted his eyes to her face again, they were glimmering with a cryptic satisfaction. \"Please don\u0027t. I haven\u0027t got time this morning to use that slipper on your backside which is what I would feel obliged to do if you throw it at me.\"\n Sariana glared at him. \"Don\u0027t pretend you can read my mind. I know that\u0027s impossible. You just took an educated guess. It wouldn\u0027t be hard to figure out I\u0027m annoyed with you and that slipper is the only convenient object at hand.\"\n \"And you do have a penchant for throwing things at me when you lose your temper,\" he concluded helpfully as he started toward the cabin door. \"You\u0027re right, Sariana. It was just an educated guess. I\u0027ll see you early this afternoon. Try to stay out of trouble while I\u0027m gone.\"\n Sariana knelt upright on the bunk, her hands clenched. She stared at the door as it closed behind him. \"And you, Gryph Chassyn,\" she informed the empty room, \"have a penchant for giving orders. But I never agreed to obey them. We have a business arrangement. Just a mutually beneficial truce while we hunt for that cutter. That\u0027s all I agreed to last night. And I\u0027ve got news for you. Lord Chassyn: when it comes to conducting business, I\u0027m a thousand times faster and smarter than some dumb, arrogant, muscle-brained frontier lord who scrapes out a living hunting bandits.\"\n She jumped off the bed and went to find her walking shoes. The scarlet-toe peeked over the edge of a cloak pocket where it had spent the night and hissed inquiringly.\n \"That\u0027s right. Lucky, we\u0027re busting out of here. There isn\u0027t a jail made that can hold us, pal. You and I are going to escape this joint for a few hours. Come on, let\u0027s go.\"\n She picked up her cloak, settled the lizard onto her shoulder and made for the door. She was involved in a business arrangement. She had that on good authority. The best. A Shield\n himself had told her so. Well, so be it.\n The first order of business was to find a medic.\n It wasn\u0027t hard to locate a female medic in Little Chance. An hour after she had left the windrigger, Sariana found herself talking bluntly with a competent, older woman who specialized in treating women. The medic wore the ancient insignia of a serpent and staff which harked back to the symbol of the medics who had been on board The Serendipity.\n \"Now, you\u0027re certain you understand how to dampen and insert this little sponge?\" the medic asked for the last time.\n Sariana nodded a little dubiously. \"It seems simple enough.\"\n \"It is. Effective, too. If it\u0027s used regularly. Don\u0027t think you can skip a time or two. You must use it every time you have sex.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-49.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
