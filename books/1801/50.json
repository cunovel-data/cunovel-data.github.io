It would provide an extra margin of safety.\"\n Sariana tried to imagine the reaction she would get from Gryph if she presented him with a package of male contraceptives. \"I don\u0027t think he would use anything.\"\n The medic eyed her patient disapprovingly. \"A woman should think twice about getting involved with a man who refuses to assume his share of the responsibility.\"\n Sariana sighed. \"I know. The problem is, he\u0027s a Shield and I don\u0027t think he would - \" \"A Shield!\" The woman stared at her in astonishment. \"Then why are you worrying about\n contraceptives? There\u0027s no danger of him getting you pregnant.\"\n \"Is that really true?\" Sariana asked urgently. It was the first reliable confirmation she\u0027d had of what she had been told. Surely a medic would not give credence to a legend unless there was some genuine fact at the base of it.\n \"Of course it\u0027s true.\" The medic shook her head. \"I keep forgetting you easterners know very little about our ways and you probably know nothing about Shields. To be honest, most of us don\u0027t talk about them too much to outsiders. I suppose we\u0027re a little in awe of them, even after all these years of coexisting with them. But since you\u0027re involved with one, you should know some facts. He can\u0027t get you pregnant unless you\u0027re his Shieldmate, and if that\u0027s the case, you can forget the contraceptives. He\u0027ll go through prisma fire to get you pregnant. The last thing he would do is allow you to use anything. Not unless the pregnancy would endanger your life. And even in that rare situation I\u0027ve heard of Shields and their mates taking a chance.\"\n \"Having children is so important to a Shield?\"\n The medic shrugged. \"It\u0027s a matter of survival. As a class they are hanging on by their fingernails, one notch above extinction. Their birthrate is extremely low, even when the men manage to find mates. And they produce no female children. Without females of their own, Shields have a very shaky hold on reproduction. Each new generation of men must search for a mate among the other social classes, and\u0027 the odds of finding a woman who can be a Shieldmate are not good. There\u0027s no way to test for the potential in a woman. Even if it were possible, I doubt that many respectable families would want their daughters tested.\"\n \"I think I can guess why,\" Sariana said dryly.\n The medic shrugged. \"A woman who marries a Shield leaves her clan and social class to join the Shield class. Practically speaking, that means she winds up living in some far-off mountain fortress town. Not too many women are anxious to give up their friends, family and the comforts of city life to keep house out on the frontier.\"\n \"I think I get the picture,\" Sariana said quietly. So part of what Gryph had told her was true. \"After all these years of marrying non-Shield women, though, haven\u0027t their bloodlines become diluted?\"\n \"They only care about the talent for working prisma. And that appears to be a dominant trait that is passed along by the males through certain receptive females. Just like their odd eye color. Neither eye color nor the skill with prisma shows any sign of weakening in successive generations. No medic pretends to understand the whole biological process, and Shields don\u0027t talk about it much to outsiders, but facts are facts. As long as a Shield can find a true mate, he can reproduce his own kind.\"\n \"But what kind is that?\" Sariana asked in confusion. \"What is this talk of working prisma?\" \"You said you were involved in an affair with a Shield,\" the medic observed slowly. \"He tells me that under the law we\u0027re married,\" Sariana said ruefully.\n The medic was startled. \"You\u0027re his wife? A Shield-mate? Then I definitely think you should put your questions to him. I don\u0027t know enough to answer them completely for you, anyway. Furthermore, he probably would not take kindly to my attempting to educate you. Shields can be very difficult about matters they consider Shield business.\"\n Sariana nodded in resignation. \"Thank you. Medic Vallon.\"\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\" The medic eyed Sariana closely. \"Are you really some Shield\u0027s mate?\" she asked thoughtfully.\n Sariana\u0027s hand closed around the package the medic had just given her. \"He seems to think I am.\" \"And you intend to avoid getting pregnant?\"\n \"It would ruin my whole future,\" Sariana whispered. \"I\u0027m not staying here, you see. Eventually I\u0027ll be going home to the eastern provinces. I was born and raised in Rendezvous. I\u0027m only here for a year or two.\"\n The medic shook her head uneasily. \"This is the first time I have ever heard of a Shield finding a mate from the eastern provinces. Now that there is growing contact between us, this sort of situation may become more common. Unfortunately, no provision was made for it in the First Generation Pact the colonists made with the Shields.\"\n Sariana didn\u0027t like the somber tone in the other woman\u0027s voice. \"Why is it so unfortunate?\" Medic Vallon looked at her. \"You can trust a Shield with your life. Everyone in the west knows that to\n a Shield, his word is his bond. They adhere rigidly to the terms of the Pact. But they are a desperate class who face extinction with each new generation. If they discover that they can find mates in the eastern provinces, you can be certain they will start searching for them there as well as here. But the people of the eastern continent have no pact with which to control them.\"\n Sariana\u0027s mouth went dry. \"Are they so very dangerous? It sounds like there are only a few of them.\" \"Any intelligent being facing extinction would probably become dangerous out of desperation. But in\n the case of the Shields, the business of being dangerous takes on new meaning. The luck of the day to you, Sariana Dayne. I\u0027m beginning to think you will need it. A word of warning. If I were you, I would not let your Shield know about that little sponge I just gave you. If he does find out, I would consider it a great favor if you would avoid telling him who prescribed it for you.\"\n There was a light, misty rain falling by the time Sariana reached the street. A disgusted hiss from Lucky made Sariana pause long enough to reach up and remove the lizard from her shoulder.\n \"So you don\u0027t like getting wet, hmm? Here you go. I hope that suits you.\" She popped the scarlet-toe into a pocket of her cloak and then pulled up the hood to cover her hair. The hissing stopped as the lizard settled down into the comfortable pocket. Sariana put the package she had gotten from the medic into another pocket.\n If she hadn\u0027t gotten lost on the way back to the docks, she would never have stumbled onto the fair. It was being held at the edge of town and the array of brightly colored tents, awnings and flags stretched as far as Sariana could see. The misting rain did not seem to affect the enthusiasm of the crowds. The fairgrounds were thronged with brilliantly garbed people. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-50.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
