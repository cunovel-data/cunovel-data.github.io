If someone gets hold of you, he\u0027s got hold of me.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n Gryph halted without any warning and swung around to confront her. His face was a tightly controlled, unreadable mask. \"You keep saying that but it\u0027s not true. You\u0027re smart and you\u0027re clever and you\u0027re educated. You do understand. At least you understand some of it. You just don\u0027t want to admit how involved with me you really are. And you have a bad habit of ignoring facts that don\u0027t happen to suit your version of events.\"\n It was too much. Sariana decided she had been through enough that day. Her eyes narrowed. \"It\u0027s not my fault if some stupid local has assumed we\u0027re married and that you\u0027ll do anything to keep your newfound breeding machine.\"\n \"It may not be your fault, but it\u0027s a fact,\" Gryph retorted heartlessly. It was obvious he, too, felt he\u0027d suffered enough lately. He was in no mood to pacify his outraged wife.\n Sariana felt her spirits plummet once more. The fight went out of her as Gryph steered her up the gangplank of the windrigger. \"You\u0027re not even going to bother to deny it, are you?\" she asked listlessly.\n \"Deny what?\" Gryph was no longer paying close attention. He was scanning the deck for a member of the crew.\n \"That you think of me as nothing more than a breeding machine.\"\n \"Sariana, I haven\u0027t got time right now to soothe your feminine ego.\" He gave her a small push toward the entrance to the lower deck. \"Go pack your things and mine, too. We\u0027re leaving the ship in a few minutes.\"\n She started to demand an explanation for this latest irrational decision but it was too late. Gryph was already striding toward the captain\u0027s quarters. Sariana reached into her cloak pocket and touched the inquiring nose of the lizard.\n \"One of these days, Lucky, that man is going to find out that not everything functions according to his master plan. If I didn\u0027t want that cutter back as badly as he does I swear I\u0027d walk off this ship this instant and disappear.\"\n It was as she turned toward the cabin that it belatedly occurred to Sariana that disappearing might be exactly what she did if she got off the ship without Gryph\u0027s protection. The memories of the genuine scare she had received in the House of Reflections were still very vivid in her mind.\n Late that afternoon Sariana found herself on a small craft called a river sled. It was another clever western invention, she was forced to concede as she sat in the bow and stared at the wide, lazy river unwinding in front of her. It required only one person to run the simple but efficient mechanism that propelled the small boat through the water with a system of meticulously designed blades. It came as no great surprise that Gryph knew how to manage the sled. Apparently there wasn\u0027t much he couldn\u0027t handle. Sariana felt a certain amount of resentment about that.\n They had left Little Chance a couple of hours earlier, following the wide, meandering river that rolled lazily down from the distant mountains through farmland, plains and canyons. The last farm had been passed some time ago and Sariana had seen no further sign of civilization.\n The flatlands and gently rolling hill country were giving way to more rugged scenes, but the river was still tame and manageable- Gryph appeared to be quite competent with the little boat. Sariana glanced back over her shoulder and saw that he was caught up in his own thoughts. There was an expression of concentration on his face.\n The late afternoon sun painted the rough landscape a spectacular shade of yellow and mauve. Sariana began to relax for the first time that day. Idly she speculated on what sorts of convoluted, irrational, and no doubt cryptic thoughts a Shield might entertain while in the frame of mind Gryph was obviously in at the moment. The passing scenery lulled her into a passive mood. Almost casually she let her mind drift, opening herself to any stray thought that happened to float into it.\n She nearly fell off the narrow bench on which she was sitting when an image of herself as seen from the rear formed in her mind. She was completely nude. Her back was gracefully straight, her head was held at an imperious angle, her waist looked small and her derriereâ€¦ Sariana nearly choked as she realized that from this angle her rear end appeared to be quite lush and sensuously curved. Never in her life had she seen herself in this way.\n And then it occurred to her that she wouldn\u0027t be viewing herself this way right now if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that someone else was seeing her this way. She resisted the urge to turn around. It was impossible. She refused to admit that the alien image of herself was coming straight from Gryph\u0027s head. Her imagination was running wild.\n She blinked a few times to clear her befuddled brain and the disturbing image vanished. Experimentally she tried to recall it but it was gone for good. Sariana breathed a small sigh of relief and went back to studying the landscape.\n The river was beginning to wind through small canyons now. Occasionally the water became rough for a short time, but under Gryph\u0027s expert handling the river sled bounced merrily through the light rapids and back into gentler waters without a protest.\n The canyons became more frequent, their walls higher and more forbidding. Heavy shadows began to cloak the river.\n \"We\u0027ll stop here for the night,\" Gryph finally announced as he slowed the river sled and angled it into a serene cove. It was the first time he had spoken in hours other than to issue curt commands relating to the boat.\n Sariana lifted her chin. \"I think you should know I have never camped out in my life.\"\n \"Somehow that doesn\u0027t surprise me. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m an expert.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t surprise me,\" she countered. She glanced around curiously. \"At least it\u0027s warm and it\u0027s not raining.\"\n \"I\u0027ll build a fire ashore and we\u0027ll cook our evening meal there, but we\u0027ll sleep on board the sled. There are hawk-beetles in these canyons.\"\n \"What a pleasant thought.\" Sariana got to her feet and stretched. The scarlet-toe, which had been dozing on her shoulder, awakened and yawned. \"I think I would like a bath before dinner. Are these waters safe?\"\n Gryph was rummaging around in the travel packs. \"Safe enough here in the shallows. You can have your bath. I could use one, too.\"\n \"Good. I think I\u0027ll just trot around that little bend up ahead and find a nice, private spot.\" Sariana was feeling more cheerful as she contemplated her bath.\n \"You will stay right here in the cove,\" Gryph ordered without even bothering to glance at her. He was busy opening the food lockers. \"I\u0027m not letting you out of my sight again today.\"\n \"Now, Gryph,\" Sariana said soothingly, \"there\u0027s no reason to overdo the protective bit. As long as I stay within shouting distance, what can go wrong?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-58.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
