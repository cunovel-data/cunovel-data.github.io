He wondered how she could still be such a mystery to him after what they had been through together last night. Then he remembered his father once telling him that the mystery of a woman, even a Shieldmate, was never completely solved. Gryph waited in an agony of suspense for Sariana to acknowledge the link that had been forged between them. When she did, he would explain her new status to her.\n \"Last night was something of an experience for both of us, wasn\u0027t it?\" Sariana observed with astonishing calm. She absently touched the scarlet-toe on her shoulder. The creature\u0027s tongue lanced out and briefly touched her palm. Sariana lowered her hand and smiled a little too brilliantly at Gryph. \"I think we were both a little out of control. You were obviously reacting strongly to the anesthetic the medic gave you for your shoulder and I was reacting to the Avylyns\u0027 punch. I am still not completely accustomed to the clever concoctions you westerners create with alcohol. In the east we stick to wine\n and beer. I should know by now that any punch served at a party here is bound to be quite strong. But I\u0027m glad to hear you\u0027re feeling better this morning. So am I.\"\n Gryph stared at her, at a loss for words. He had been prepared for hurt accusations, a host of questions and a great deal of confusion on Sariana\u0027s part. There was much, after all, that needed to be explained. The one thing he had not expected was a complete denial of the whole experience. He remembered belatedly that the lady had a way with words.\n \"Sariana,\" he finally said quietly, \"there\u0027s no point in denying what happened last night. You were not under the influence of too much punch and I was fully aware of what I was doing, even if I was a little groggy from the anesthetic.\" His mouth curved faintly. \"You, of all people, know the anesthetic wasn\u0027t working very well, anyway.\"\n Sariana\u0027s fingers tightened on the door. \"Why don\u0027t we meet in my office after breakfast, Gryph? We have a lot to discuss. I want a full report of what happened last night when you went to meet your informant. Then we can make plans for the next step in this matter of retrieving the prisma cutter.\"\n \"Don\u0027t think you can retreat behind a wall of words and a business discussion,\" he muttered. \"Listen, Sariana, I don\u0027t want to put this off until after breakfast. I think we should discuss it now. You have to understand a few things.\"\n She nodded quickly. \"Yes, I know. I have a whole list of questions.\" Gryph relaxed slightly. \"I thought you might.\"\n \u0027To begin with, I want to hear every detail about the meeting with your informer last night. I want to know exactly what happened so we can make plans. I still think we may have to call in the town guards. But we must try to think of some way to protect the Avylyns\u0027 reputation. If you\u0027re to continue on this assignment, we\u0027ll have to concoct a new excuse for your presence in the household. I\u0027ve been giving that some thought this morning and I\u0027ve come up with a couple of ideas that might work.\"\n Gryph stared at her, realizing he hadn\u0027t made any headway at all. Sariana was prepared to ignore the whole experience. He could hardly believe it. He stepped through the doorway, forcing her back a pace. From its perch on Sariana\u0027s shoulder the scarlet-toe watched Gryph and bared its tiny teeth. Gryph paid no attention to the lizard. His attention was focused on Sariana.\n \"You don\u0027t seem to understand what\u0027s going on here, Sariana,\" he began with as much patience as he could muster. \"I realize you\u0027re confused. I\u0027m prepared to explain everything to you. But this is between you and me. I am not particularly interested in the Avylyns\u0027 problem at the moment.\"\n Sariana\u0027s smile vanished. \"I am sorry to hear that, Gryph, because you were hired precisely for the purpose of interesting yourself in the Avylyns\u0027 problems. Are you telling me I am not going to get my money\u0027s worth out of you?\"\n \"What money\u0027s worth?\" he exploded. \"So far I haven\u0027t received a single trell note from you. Forget the money, we\u0027ve got more important things to discuss and not a whole lot of time in which to discuss them.\" Her chin lifted challengingly. \"You\u0027re going somewhere?\"\n \"We are going somewhere. You and I. From now on, Sariana, we will be doing most things together.\" Sariana drew herself up to her full height which put her somewhere in the neighborhood of Gryph\u0027s\n shoulder.\n \"I was not aware you were going to be so possessive,\" she stated. \"Just because we were, well, involved for one night, does not mean you have any claim on me.\"\n \"No claim on you! Have you lost your senses, lady?\"\n \"You westerners are all alike.\" Sariana glared at him. \"High-strung and emotional. If you\u0027re going to insist on conducting a temperamental scene over the subject of our relationship, I would prefer to do so later in my office. After we have analyzed what you found out about the missing cutter last night.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just bet you would prefer to hold our discussion in your office where you can hide behind that black stone desk of yours and give lectures on the emotional nature of westerners. But I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027m going to let you get away with that.\" Gryph paused to take a grip on his temper. Patience, he reminded himself. This was a time for patience. He was dealing with a strong-willed, proud young woman who had been through a very disorienting experience. Her first sexual encounter with a man had not been anything close to what she had probably been expecting. She was only trying to cope with something that\n must seem very alien to her. \"Sariana, I want to explain a few things to you.\"\n \"Such as?\"\n \"Such as the laws of the land,\" he retorted gently. \"You\u0027ve been living with the Avylyns for several months. Hasn\u0027t anyone ever mentioned the First Generation Pact to you?\"\n \"No. And I really don\u0027t have time for a history lesson. Nor do I feel like listening to any legends right now. I\u0027m on my way to breakfast.\"\n She walked straight past him into the gallery and closed the door behind her. The scarlet-toe on her shoulder showed its teeth again in what Gryph decided was a very superior attitude for a lizard. It was an attitude the creature had clearly adopted from its new owner.\n Sariana made her way briskly along the gallery, the hem of her gown snapping at her ankles. Gryph watched her for a moment, absorbing the tilt of her proudly carried head, the straight line of her gracefully shaped back and the no-nonsense sway of her hips.\n It occurred to him then that his new Shieldmate had a full measure of pride as well as courage. She was trying very hard to pretend that nothing unusual had happened, but beneath that sweetly arrogant pose was a young woman trying to grapple with what must have been a very unsettling mix of emotions. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-32.html","bookId":1801,"book":{"id":1801,"title":"Shield\u0027s Lady (Lost Colony #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sarianna was a cool, confident businesswoman, an outcast from the East determined to regain her rightful status.
