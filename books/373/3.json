{"id":19477,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II A QUARREL IN THE BARNYARD","content":"The sight of Abner Balberry flat on his back, and with the milk flowing over him, was a comical one, and for the instant Nat had to laugh out-right. \"Hi! hi!\" roared the farmer. \"Git away! Drat the beasts! Now, Nat Nason, jest see what you\u0027ve done!\" He struggled to his feet, and Nat at once became sober, for he realized that trouble was at hand. \"It\u0027s too bad, Uncle Abner——\" began the youth. \"Too bad? I should say it was too bad!\" cried the farmer. \"An\u0027 all your fault, too!\" \"I can\u0027t see how it was my fault. You told me to drive the cow up here.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me, Nat Nason! It\u0027s your fault. An\u0027 all that fresh milk gone to waste!\" Abner Balberry gave a groan. \"I don\u0027t know most what I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to do with you fer this.\" \"I can\u0027t see how it\u0027s my fault.\" \"You made the cows git frightened.\" \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me! Don\u0027t you know that milk is worth money?\" \"Yes, but——\" \"You scart thet cow out o\u0027 her wits,\" went on the farmer, his rage growing as he looked at the spilt milk. \"Nat Nason, I tell you, you\u0027re a bad boy!\" To this the youth made no reply. \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to teach ye a lesson fer it!\" \"Shall I milk Jule?\" \"Yes, an\u0027 mind ye don\u0027t spill a drop nuther!\" Silently Nat went to work, and milked not only the new cow but also two of the others. By this time milking was over, and the lacteal fluid was carried to the spring-house to cool. Then the cows were allowed to wander down to the pasture for the night. When Nat approached the kitchen again an appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air. The boy\u0027s uncle followed him. \"Supper is ready,\" said Mrs. Felton, cheerfully. \"You had some trouble with the cows, didn\u0027t you?\" she continued. \"It was Nat\u0027s fault,\" grumbled Abner Balberry. \"He made them run around an\u0027 upset everything. Nat, I said as how I was going to teach ye a lesson. You wash up an\u0027 go to bed at once.\" \"Go to bed?\" queried the boy. \"Thet\u0027s what I said, didn\u0027t I?\" \"Do you mean right after supper?\" \"No, I mean before supper,\" snarled Abner Balberry. \"Oh, isn\u0027t he to have his supper first?\" put in the housekeeper, timidly. \"No, he ain\u0027t.\" After this abrupt declaration there was an awkward pause. \"Do you want me to go to bed without my supper?\" asked Nat, slowly. \"That\u0027s what I said.\" \"It isn\u0027t fair.\" \"Ain\u0027t it?\" \"No, it isn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t my fault that the milk was spilt, so there!\" \"You say much more to me an\u0027 I\u0027ll tan yer hide well fer ye!\" stormed Abner Balberry. \"Don\u0027t you want him to have none of the fish he brought in?\" asked the housekeeper. \"The fish ain\u0027t worth much.\" \"Maybe you\u0027d like to have all the fish yourself?\" put in Nat, tartly, before he had stopped to think. Angered at this remark the farmer turned around and caught the youth by the collar and began to shake him. \"I\u0027ll teach ye to talk back to me!\" he snarled. \"I\u0027ll teach ye! Now go to bed, an\u0027 be quick about it.\" \"I want my supper!\" came doggedly from Nat. He felt that he had earned the meal and he needed it. \"Not a mouthful.\" \"If you don\u0027t give me my supper I won\u0027t work for you any more, Uncle Abner!\" \"Wot! Goin\u0027 to talk to me like this!\" screamed the farmer, and caught the boy once again. \"Up to your room with ye, before I trounce ye well!\" He shook Nat fiercely, and a struggle ensued between the pair which came to an end when a chair was overturned and then a side table on which rested some of the things for supper. \"Oh, the eating!\" screamed the housekeeper, in alarm. \"And the teapot is smashed!\" she added, sadly. \"It\u0027s all Nat\u0027s fault,\" came from Abner Balberry. \"He is a good-fer-nuthin\u0027, he is! Off to bed with ye, before I git my horsewhip!\" He opened the door leading to the enclosed stairs, and fearful of another attack Nat retreated. As soon as he was on the stairs, the farmer slammed the door shut and bolted it. A minute later he and Mrs. Felton heard the youth ascend the stairs to his own room. \"It was kind of hard on the boy to make him go to bed without his supper,\" remarked the housekeeper, as she gathered up the things on the floor. \"It\u0027s his own fault,\" snorted the farmer. \"He\u0027s got to be took down, he has!\" \"He hasn\u0027t had a mouthful since noon, and we had a light dinner, too.\" \"I can\u0027t help that, Mrs. Felton. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to teach him a lesson.\" \"Nat is a high-spirited boy, Mr. Balberry. Maybe he won\u0027t stand for it.\" \"He has got to stand fer it,\" was the answer, from the sink, where the farmer was washing his face and hands. \"But if he won\u0027t?\" \"Wot can he do, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know—but he may do something that you least expect.\" \"He won\u0027t do nuthin\u0027,\" said the farmer, and sank down in his seat at the table. \"He can\u0027t do nuthin\u0027. I give him a good home, but he don\u0027t seem to a\u0027preciate it nohow.\" To this Mrs. Felton did not reply, but set the food on the table. The fish had not been spoilt, and the farmer ate all he wished of the dish. \"Why don\u0027t you eat?\" he asked of the housekeeper, seeing that she had abstained from touching the fish. \"I—I don\u0027t care for it,\" she answered. She had in mind to save what was left and give it to Nat for his breakfast. \"That boy is gittin\u0027 too big fer his boots,\" went on Abner Balberry. \"He acts like he was of age, an\u0027 he is only sixteen. Last week he wanted to know how soon I was goin\u0027 to pay him reg\u0027lar wages.\" \"And what did you tell him?\" \"Told him I\u0027d pay him wages when he was wuth it an\u0027 not before.\" \"He does almost a man\u0027s work now, doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Not much! Besides, don\u0027t I feed an\u0027 clothe him an\u0027 give him a comfortable home? He\u0027s got too high-falutin\u0027 notions, he has!\" \"But don\u0027t you think he ought to have some money?\" went on Mrs. Felton, who could be a trifle independent herself at times. \"No. Money is the ruination o\u0027 young folks. Week before last he wanted a quarter to go to the circus with, but he didn\u0027t git it.\" \"Almost all of the boys in this district went to the circus. Tom Bradley told me it was very good, too.\" \"Humph! That Bradley boy is going to the dogs as fast as he can go.\" \"Deacon Slide thinks he is a very good boy.\" \"Well, the deacon don\u0027t know everything. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to make Nat toe the mark until he is twenty-one. After that I\u0027ll wash my hands o\u0027 him.\" The farmer finished his supper and then went out to see that everything was all right around the farm for the night. A little later he took a lamp and went upstairs. Tiptoeing his way through an upper hall he came to a pause in front of Nat\u0027s room. \"Asleep, jest as I thought,\" he told himself, after listening to the boy\u0027s breathing. Then he peeped into the room, to behold Nat lying under the cover of the bed, with his face turned to the wall. \"I\u0027ll give him another talkin\u0027 to in the mornin\u0027,\" the farmer told himself; and then retired, with no thought of what was going to happen before the sun arose upon another day. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81814.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
