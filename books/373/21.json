{"id":19495,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX RUFUS CAMERON\u0027S BOLD MOVE","content":"\"What do you want?\" demanded our hero. He did not like the idea of being detained, now that his business was concluded. \"I want to talk to you a minute,\" said the man. \"Come into the parlor.\" \"I am in something of a hurry, Mr.——\" \"My name is Rufus Cameron. Mrs. Parloe is my aunt. I must talk to you. Come in.\" Rufus Cameron caught a firm hold of our hero and almost forced him into the parlor. Then he shut the door tightly and stood in front of it. \"What do you want?\" demanded Nat. He did not like the looks of Rufus Cameron. The fellow\u0027s face was dissipated. \"You got my aunt to sign a certain document, didn\u0027t you?\" \"What if I did?\" \"I want to see that paper.\" \"If you do, you\u0027ll have to see my employer about it.\" \"You\u0027ve got the paper right here. Why can\u0027t you show it to me?\" \"Because I have no authority for so doing,\" answered our hero, firmly. \"Humph! It won\u0027t hurt you to let me look over the paper,\" growled Rufus Cameron. \"I have my orders.\" \"Did John Garwell tell you not to show me the paper?\" \"He told me to have it signed, and to bring it right back.\" \"Well, I want to see it, and I\u0027m going to do it before you leave this house.\" \"Are you going to take the paper away from me!\" cried Nat, in alarm. \"I only want to look at it. As soon as I\u0027ve read it, I\u0027ll give it back to you.\" \"I can\u0027t allow the paper to go out of my possession, Mr. Cameron.\" \"Mrs. Parloe isn\u0027t entirely responsible for what she does. I must see to it that everything is all right.\" \"Well, you had better call on Mr. Garwell.\" \"No, I must see the document while you have it here. Come! hand it over.\" \"I will not.\" Nat had scarcely spoken when Rufus Cameron caught him roughly by the shoulder. \"Look here, boy, I am not a man to be trifled with!\" he whispered, fiercely. \"Let me see the paper, and it will be all right. But if you won\u0027t, I\u0027ll make a whole lot of trouble for you.\" \"Let go of me!\" and Nat tried to pull himself away. \"You stole this ring while you were upstairs,\" said Rufus Cameron, quickly, and, putting his hand in Nat\u0027s side pocket, he brought it out again with a diamond ring. \"I—I never saw that ring before,\" gasped Nat. \"You stole it, I say, and unless you behave yourself, I\u0027ll have you arrested,\" went on Rufus Cameron, coldly. Nat was dumfounded, but like a flash he saw through the trick that the man wanted to play on him. \"You can\u0027t fool me, Mr. Rufus Cameron,\" said he, sharply. \"Let me go, or I\u0027ll have you hauled up in court for this. Your dirty trick won\u0027t work with me.\" Rufus Cameron fell back, crestfallen. He had not anticipated such bravery on our hero\u0027s part. He was a coward at heart, and too much liquor had somewhat muddled his brain. \"Then you won\u0027t show me the document?\" he muttered. \"No.\" As Nat uttered the word, Rufus Cameron picked up a sea shell lying on a mantelshelf, and swung it behind his head. \"If you don\u0027t let me see that——\" he began. Nat rushed at him, and pushed him to one side. Then our hero made for the door. He was just opening it when the seashell was sent whizzing forward. It hit Nat on the head, and the boy dropped unconscious across an easy chair. For the instant Rufus Cameron was startled. Then rushing to the door, he locked it, and also locked some folding doors leading to a rear apartment. \"I hope I didn\u0027t hurt him much,\" he muttered. \"What a young fool he was not to let me see the paper.\" He propped Nat up in the easy chair, and placed his hand in the boy\u0027s inside pocket. Soon he had the document in his possession, and was looking over it rapidly. \"Just as I thought. I\u0027m glad I got it. Now, we\u0027ll see if Shanley and I can\u0027t outwit Mr. John Garwell.\" Nat was already coming to his senses, and Rufus Cameron lost no time in hurrying to the library of the house. Here he obtained an old document of no consequence, but which still bore his aunt\u0027s signature. Rushing back, he placed this in the envelope which had held the other paper of importance. Nat was just returning to his senses when he found himself being taken out of the house by Rufus Cameron. The man supported him as far as the corner and there placed him on a stone step leading to a church. \"Wha—what did you hit me for?\" stammered our hero, feebly. \"I didn\u0027t mean to do that; really I didn\u0027t,\" said Rufus Cameron, smoothly. \"The shell slipped. I am very sorry—very sorry, indeed.\" \"It was a mean thing to do.\" \"It was an accident, I give you my word on it.\" Nat felt in his pocket to learn if the document was still there. \"Did you look at that paper?\" he questioned. \"No, I didn\u0027t. On second thought I have concluded to let my aunt do just as she pleases in this matter.\" Nat felt in no condition to argue. He took out the document, glanced at it, and shoved it back into the envelope and then in his pocket. \"I\u0027m sorry this happened. I was excited for the minute. Come and have a drink with me. It will do you good,\" went on Rufus Cameron. \"I don\u0027t drink.\" \"Shall I show you to the car then?\" \"Yes.\" When Nat got up the rascal supported him, and thus they made their way to the car line running to the Bridge. Here, our hero boarded a car, and Rufus Cameron watched him ride out of sight. \"That was easy after all,\" muttered Rufus Cameron to himself. \"I only hope it don\u0027t make too much trouble in the future. I\u0027ll have to let Shanley have this document without delay, and I\u0027d better get out of sight until the affair blows over.\" Making his way to a neighboring café, Rufus Cameron treated himself to a drink of strong liquor and a black-looking cigar. Then he returned to his aunt\u0027s home. He lived with her, and was doing his best to get certain of her properties away from her. \"Aunt Jane, what did that young man want?\" he asked, as he entered her room. \"He came to see me on private business, Rufus,\" was the quiet answer. Mrs. Parloe did not fancy her nephew\u0027s habits, and had often warned him that he must reform. \"Was there anything I could do for you?\" \"No, Rufus.\" \"Do you know, Aunt Jane, I\u0027ve been thinking of taking a trip to the West,\" he went on, after a pause. \"So you said before.\" \"I\u0027d go in a minute if I had the money.\" \"How much do you want?\" \"Two or three hundred dollars at least.\" \"Is the money gone that I let you have last month?\" \"Yes, I had to pay some back bills with that.\" \"You are very extravagant, Rufus.\" \"Oh, a young man must spend something.\" \"But not as much as you spend.\" \"I don\u0027t spend any more than the rest of the fellows in my set. I have got to keep up appearances, you know.\" \"Your set is altogether too fast a one to suit me.\" \"Will you let me have the money?\" \"How long do you expect to be gone?\" \"That depends upon what you will give me. If you\u0027ll let me have five hundred dollars, I\u0027ll make a trip of two or three months.\" Mrs. Parloe thought for a moment, and at last consented to give her nephew the five hundred. She had her check book handy, and soon the check was passed over to the nephew. \"When shall you start?\" she asked. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve a good notion to start to-night. But if you want me to do anything for you before I go——\" \"There is nothing, Rufus. Only, if you want to please me, don\u0027t get into any bad habits while you are gone.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m going to turn over a new leaf when I leave Brooklyn,\" said the hypocrite. \"Then, I can leave to-night?\" \"Yes.\" \"In that case, I\u0027ll pack my trunk at once,\" said Rufus Cameron; and a little later he did so. Then he had the trunk taken away, bid his aunt good-by, and was off. \"That was easy,\" he said to himself, when away from the house. \"Now to see Shanley and to arrange for keeping out of sight, in case John Garwell kicks up a fuss.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81832.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
