{"id":19476,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I NAT ON THE FARM","content":"\"Nat, where have you been?\" \"Been fishing,\" answered the boy addressed, a sturdy youth of sixteen, with clear blue eyes and sandy hair. \"Fishin\u0027? And who said you could go fishin\u0027?\" demanded Abner Balberry, in his high, nervous voice. \"Nobody said I could go,\" answered the boy, firmly. \"But I thought you\u0027d all like to have some fish for supper, so I went.\" \"Humph! I suppose you thought as how them taters would hoe themselves, eh?\" sneered Abner Balberry, who was not only Nat\u0027s uncle, but also his guardian. \"I hoed the potatoes,\" was the boy\u0027s answer. \"Got through at half-past two o\u0027clock.\" \"If you got through so soon you didn\u0027t half do the job,\" grumbled the man. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to have you wastin\u0027 your time on no fishin\u0027, understand?\" \"Can\u0027t I go fishing at all?\" \"Not when there is work to do on this farm.\" \"But I did my work, Uncle Abner.\" \"An\u0027 I say it couldn\u0027t have been done right if ye didn\u0027t take proper time fer it, Nat Nason! I know you! You are gittin\u0027 lazy!\" \"I\u0027m not lazy!\" cried the boy, indignantly. \"I work as hard as anybody around here.\" \"Don\u0027t you talk back to me!\" ejaculated Abner Balberry. \"I say you are lazy, an\u0027 I know. How many fish did ye catch?\" \"I only got two. They didn\u0027t bite very well to-day.\" \"Humph! A-wastin\u0027 three hours an\u0027 more jest to catch two little fish! If I let you go your own way, Nat Nason, you\u0027ll be in the poorhouse before you die.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get to the poorhouse, Uncle Abner.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t talk back! Take your fish to the kitchen an\u0027 then git down to the barnyard as quick as you can. You\u0027ve got to help me milk to-night. An\u0027 don\u0027t you dare to go fishin\u0027 ag\u0027in, unless I give ye permission,\" added Abner Balberry, as he strode off towards the barn. A sharp answer arose to Nat Nason\u0027s lips, but he checked it and turned toward the kitchen of the farmhouse. \"What luck did you have, Nat?\" questioned the did woman who was Abner Balberry\u0027s housekeeper. \"Not much luck, Mrs. Felton. They didn\u0027t bite very well to-day.\" \"What was Mr. Balberry saying to you?\" went on Mrs. Felton, who had been housekeeper at the place since the death of Mrs. Balberry, two years before. \"He was mad because I went fishing.\" \"I am sorry to hear that.\" \"Uncle Abner never wants me to have any sport.\" \"He\u0027s a hard-working man, and always was, Nat. He doesn\u0027t believe in wasting time.\" \"But a fellow ought to have a little time off.\" \"That may be true.\" \"Don\u0027t you think I work pretty hard for a boy of my age?\" \"I do, Nat.\" \"Uncle Abner wants to make a regular slave out of a fellow.\" \"Didn\u0027t he say you were to help him milk to-night?\" \"Yes, and I might as well get at it right away. If I don\u0027t, he\u0027ll give me another jawing,\" answered the boy, and placing his fish on a bench, he strode off toward the barnyard. Nat Nason was an orphan, the only child of Mr. William Nason, who had been a brother to the late Mrs. Balberry. The boy\u0027s father had been killed in a runaway and his mother had never gotten over the shock of the sudden death. When the youth found himself an orphan he was taken in by his Aunt Mary, who did what she could for him. The Nasons had not been rich, so there was little or no money coming to Nat. From the start he was told that he must earn his own living, and this he proceeded to do to the best of his ability. The death of his Aunt Mary was almost as much of a blow to the lad as the loss of his mother, for it left him under the entire charge of his uncle, Abner Balberry. The latter had no children of his own and he made Nat work as hard as if he were a full-grown man. The Balberry farm was located in Ohio, not far from the town of Caswell. It consisted of one hundred acres of good land, with a house and several outbuildings. Among his neighbors Abner Balberry was considered the meanest man in the district. Abner himself thought he was a pretty good man and he counted himself a real \"pillow\" of the church, as he expressed it. For two years life on the Balberry farm had been one continual grind to Nat Nason. He was expected to work from morning to night, and such a thing as a whole day off was utterly unknown to him. He received next to nothing in the way of spending money. \"I\u0027ll save the money fer ye,\" Abner Balberry would say, when questioned on the subject. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t good fer boys to have too much cash on hand. It makes \u0027em reckless.\" \"But you never give me anything,\" had been Nat\u0027s answer. \"Never mind—I\u0027m a-givin\u0027 you a good home an\u0027 good eatin\u0027,\" was the answer. The good home and good fare were something to be questioned. Nat\u0027s room was a small one under the roof, his clothing usually made over from the garments worn by Mr. Balberry, and such a thing as an elaborate table was unknown on the farm. Many times Mrs. Felton had wished to cook more, or make some fancy dishes, but Abner Balberry had always stopped her from doing such a thing. \"Plain fare is good enough,\" he would say. \"An\u0027 if ye eat too much it only brings on the dyspepsy.\" More than once Nat went to bed feeling positively hungry. When Nat reached the barnyard he found his uncle already there with the milk pails and milking an old white cow called Sukey. \"Go on down the lane and drive up Jule,\" cried Abner Balberry, without stopping his milking. \"She just went down that way.\" \"All right,\" answered Nat, and passing through the barnyard he hurried down the lane mentioned. Jule was a new cow that the farmer had purchased a week before. She did not seem inclined to herd with the other animals and Nat had had quite a good deal of trouble with her before. At the end of the lane was an orchard and here he found the cow, contentedly eating the fresh grass. She tried to get away from him, but he was too quick for the creature and soon had her turned around and headed up the lane. Then he stopped to get an apple, for his fishing trip had made him hungry and he knew that supper was still a good hour off. \"I wish I had some other kind of a job,\" he murmured, with a sigh. \"Somehow, farming doesn\u0027t seem to be just the right thing for me. Wish I was in some big city.\" \"Hurry up with that cow!\" cried Abner Balberry. \"Do you think I\u0027m going to stop here all night fer milkin\u0027?\" \"I\u0027m coming!\" sang out Nat. \"Get along, Jule, you old slow poke!\" He gave the cow a slap on the side, and away she flew up the lane. The boy followed, finishing the apple as he went. As it happened several cows were bunched up near the entrance to the lane and as the new cow appeared, driven by Nat, the bunch scattered. Then Jule ran directly into the barnyard. \"Hi! hi! stop!\" yelled Abner Balberry. \"Drat the beast! Stop!\" But the new cow did not stop, and a moment later she stepped into a pailful of milk, and tipped it over. Then she ran against another cow that the farmer was milking. This cow swerved around, and in a twinkling Abner Balberry was thrown on his back and the milk was sent flying over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81813.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
