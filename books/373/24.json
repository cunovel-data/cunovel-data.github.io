{"id":19498,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII TOM NOLAN\u0027S CONFESSION","content":"A cry of horror went up from those who saw the mishap, and some women present turned their heads away, expecting that the semi-intoxicated individual would be killed. Nat\u0027s heart leaped into his throat, but he did not lose his presence of mind. He was but a few feet from the man, and as quick as a flash he jumped forward, caught the fellow up, and dragged him out of harm\u0027s way. \"Wha—what yer doin\u0027?\" stammered the fellow, gazing unsteadily at our hero. \"Do you want to be killed?\" asked Nat, sharply. \"They won\u0027t—won\u0027t dare to kill me,\" said the fellow. \"I\u0027m a—a—good citizen.\" \"He ought to be locked up,\" said a man standing near. \"It was a brave deed,\" said one of the ladies. \"Who\u0027s goin\u0027 to lock me up?\" demanded the tramp, for he was nothing less. And he began to show fight, at which the majority of the crowd turned away, and hurried to board the train. Nat hesitated for a second, and then concluded to let the train go on and take the next one. \"Say, you pulled me from the track, didn\u0027t you?\" said the man, after another look at Nat. \"I did.\" \"Noble boy. I ought to reward you.\" \"I don\u0027t want any reward.\" \"Humph! Don\u0027t worry, my dear friend—Tom Nolan ain\u0027t got no money to reward you with.\" And the semi-drunken man indulged in a senseless chuckle. \"See here, haven\u0027t I met you before?\" demanded Nat, looking at the man more closely than ever. \"Maybe yer have, an\u0027 maybe yer haven\u0027t.\" \"Where do you come from?\" \"Me? I\u0027m an Ohio man, I am, and I ain\u0027t ashamed to own it. Ohio\u0027s best State in the union.\" \"So you are from Ohio. Were you ever in and around Brookville and Caswell?\" went on our hero, suddenly. \"Sure. I spent two months in that district not very long ago. But I had to git out, I did.\" And the tramp chuckled again. \"What made you get out?\" And now Nat was all attention. \"Folks didn\u0027t like me around.\" \"Didn\u0027t you treat them fairly?\" \"Sure I did, but they thought their barns was too good for Tom Nolan to sleep in.\" \"And that\u0027s why they chased you away, eh?\" \"Thet\u0027s it, my young friend. It was this way—to tell the plain truth. One night I went to sleep in a barn with my pipe in my mouth. Fust thing I knowed some hay got afire. A man came runnin\u0027 to put the fire out, and I had to leg it to git away.\" \"Was that up between Caswell and Brookville?\" \"You\u0027ve struck it, but—but—what\u0027s this to you, anyway?\" and now Tom Nolan began to look disturbed. \"It\u0027s a good deal to me. That was my uncle\u0027s barn, and I was accused of setting it on fire.\" \"Gee shoo! Yer don\u0027t say! Say, I\u0027ve put my foot into it, ain\u0027t I?\" \"You certainly have.\" \"But, say, honest, I—I didn\u0027t mean to set the shebang afire—not on my life, I didn\u0027t.\" \"You were smoking, and fell asleep.\" \"Thet\u0027s the honest truth o\u0027 the matter, my young friend. I\u0027m a tramp, an\u0027 down on my luck, but I ain\u0027t no barn burner, not me!\" \"Well, you had better come with me,\" said Nat, decidedly. \"What are yer goin\u0027 to do?\" \"I want a witness to what you just said.\" \"Goin\u0027 to have me—me locked up?\" \"No, it\u0027s not worth it. I only want to prove to my uncle that I am not guilty, that\u0027s all.\" The tramp followed Nat down into the street and then over to John Garwell\u0027s office. \"Why, what does this mean, Nat?\" demanded his employer, in astonishment, for visits from tramps were unusual. Our hero lost no time in telling his story. \"I want my uncle Abner to know that I am innocent, that\u0027s all,\" he continued. \"It won\u0027t do any good to hold this chap, for the barn wasn\u0027t hurt much, anyway.\" \"I\u0027ll settle this,\" said Mr. Garwell, and called in a stenographer, who took down what the tramp had to say. Then the confession was typewritten, and Tom Nolan signed it, and John Garwell added his signature as a witness. \"There, Nat, that is all right now,\" said the real estate broker. \"You can send that to your uncle when you please, and we can keep a copy.\" \"This is all I want,\" said our hero to the tramp. \"You may go now.\" \"Don\u0027t want no more o\u0027 me?\" asked Tom Nolan. \"Nothing whatever.\" \"Say, ain\u0027t this confession good fer a quarter?\" \"I\u0027ll give you a quarter if you\u0027ll promise not to spend it for drink.\" \"I\u0027ll promise,\" said the tramp, and Nat handed him twenty-five cents. Tom Nolan thanked him, and shuffled off; and that was the last our hero saw or heard of him. \"I\u0027m sorry I lost so much time,\" said Nat to his employer. \"But I wanted to square myself with Uncle Abner if I could.\" \"I don\u0027t blame you, Nat. I have no doubt it is a great worry off your mind.\" \"It is. Now, Uncle Abner will know I told him the plain truth.\" That night Nat wrote Abner Balberry a long letter, telling of his meeting with the tramp. He enclosed the signed confession, and he had the letter registered, so that it might not get lost in the mails. A few days later came a reply, in which Nat\u0027s uncle said he remembered seeing the tramp around on the day of the fire, and stating that he was very sorry that he had ever thought his nephew guilty. Nat\u0027s work frequently took him out of town, and on one occasion he had to go to Albany, a trip which he enjoyed thoroughly, as it gave him a chance to visit the State Capitol. \"Nat,\" said John Garwell one day, \"didn\u0027t you once tell me, that your father and grandfather had come from New York and Brooklyn?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Was your grandfather ever interested in some property around Central Park?\" \"I don\u0027t know but what he was. But he got rid of his belongings, so I was told, when he moved away.\" \"Did you ever see any of the papers?\" \"Yes, sir, some years ago. They were in a trunk up in my uncle Abner\u0027s garret.\" \"What was your grandfather\u0027s full name?\" \"Chester Stout Nason. His mother was a Stout.\" \"And your father\u0027s full name?\" \"William Henry Nason.\" \"Did he have any brothers?\" \"No, sir—only a sister, who was Uncle Abner\u0027s first wife.\" \"I see. Are those papers still in the trunk you just mentioned?\" \"They ought to be. They were packed away with some old account books—bad debts, I once heard father call them. Father had an idea he could collect some of the debts some day. But I guess they are outlawed.\" \"More than likely. I\u0027d like to see those papers regarding that land near Central Park.\" \"Why, Mr. Garwell? Do you think there is anything in it for me?\" cried our hero, quickly. \"I\u0027m not prepared to say that until I see the papers. I am looking up six parcels of land, which a certain company want for the purpose of putting up a big hotel. Some of the old deeds mention a Chester S. Nason as holding a half-interest in one of the plots of ground—the interest being assigned to him in payment of a claim he had on one Maurice LeRoy. Did you ever hear of such a man?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Well, supposing you get those papers for me, and let me examine them.\" \"Shall I send to Uncle Abner for them?\" \"I think it might be better for you to go home and sort out the papers yourself. I\u0027ll explain just what I am after. Besides, if the papers are valuable, you had better not trust them to the mails. I\u0027ll pay your railroad fares.\" \"All right, I\u0027ll go home for them whenever you say, Mr. Garwell. I hope the papers do prove valuable,\" and Nat smiled broadly. \"Don\u0027t raise false hopes, Nat. There may be nothing in it. But there is nothing like being sure.\" \"Is the tract of land valuable?\" \"Very. It is located in the most fashionable territory around Central Park.\" \"When do you want me to go home?\" \"You can start to-morrow if you wish. There is no rush of business on just at present. I presume you will be back within four or five days?\" \"I\u0027ll come back as soon as possible.\" \"Take your time. A couple of days on the farm will do you good. It will be like a touch of old times.\" \"That is true,\" answered Nat. The opportunity to go back to the farm pleased him. He packed his dress-suit case that night, and left on the ten-o\u0027clock train in the morning. He was dressed in his best and had quite a city air about him. Certainly he could no longer be called a \"greeny.\" Nat spent the night at Cleveland, and took the train to Brookville in the morning. Almost the first person he met in the town was Sam Price. \"Hullo, are you back?\" cried the country boy, shaking hands. \"Back for a few days, Sam.\" \"You look fine, Nat.\" \"I feel fine. How are you getting along?\" \"Pretty good. Life on the farm is rather slow. Somebody told me you were tired of the city.\" \"It isn\u0027t true, Sam.\" \"Fred Guff says he wants to go to the city, too, but his mother won\u0027t let him.\" \"I suppose Fred helps my uncle Abner?\" \"Yes, but your uncle don\u0027t get along with him very well. Fred\u0027s too slow for him.\" Sam had driven to town with his buckboard, and he readily agreed to give Nat a ride over to Abner Balberry\u0027s farm. They were soon on the way, and less than an hour brought them in sight of the place. \"Some young man is coming, ma!\" cried Fred, who was sitting on the doorstep, munching an apple. \"Sam Price is driving him.\" \"Wonder what he wants here?\" said Mrs. Balberry, shading her eyes with her hands. \"Mercy sakes! It\u0027s Nat!\" \"Nat!\" repeated the boy. \"Huh! if it\u0027s him I guess he\u0027s sick of the city. I thought he wouldn\u0027t make a go of it.\" \"Don\u0027t you be too sure of that,\" said the mother, shortly. \"Nat has more ginger in him than you have.\" By this time Nat was at the horseblock. He leaped off the buckboard, and advanced to greet Mrs. Balberry and her son. \"How do you do?\" he cried, cheerily. \"Aren\u0027t you surprised to see me?\" \"I certainly am,\" answered Mrs. Balberry, as she shook hands. \"Got tired of the city, eh?\" came from Fred. \"I knew it wouldn\u0027t last.\" \"Do you think you could do anything in the city?\" demanded our hero, sharply. \"Of course I could.\" \"It\u0027s hard work to get along in New York.\" \"I don\u0027t care—I wouldn\u0027t make a failure of it if I went. I guess you wasn\u0027t smart enough for them New Yorkers,\" added Fred, maliciously. \"What makes you think that, Fred?\" \"If it wasn\u0027t so you wouldn\u0027t be back.\" \"Have you given up your place with Mr. Garwell?\" asked Mrs. Balberry. \"No, I\u0027m home on a vacation of a couple of days, that\u0027s all.\" \"Oh, then you are going back?\" came from Fred, and his face fell. \"Certainly I am. I have a first-class position, with a promise of advancement, so it would be sheer foolishness for me to give it up.\" \"Ma said you were with a real estate man.\" \"Yes.\" \"That can\u0027t pay much.\" \"It pays very well.\" \"How much?\" \"Ten dollars a week, at present. But I am to get more soon.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say they pay you ten dollars a week,\" cried Fred. \"That is my regular salary.\" \"Then I\u0027m going to the city to-morrow,\" said Fred, decidedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81835.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
