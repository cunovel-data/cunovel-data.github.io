{"id":19479,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV ABNER BALBERRY\u0027S DISCOVERY","content":"\"Nat!\" Abner Balberry uttered the name in a loud, clear voice and waited fully a minute for an answer. \"Nat!\" he repeated. \"I want you to answer me, do you hear? Nat!\" Still there was no reply, and now, in some alarm, Abner Balberry turned back into his bedchamber and donned part of his clothing. \"If that boy is moving around this house I\u0027m goin\u0027 to know it,\" he murmured to himself, as he felt his way toward Nat\u0027s room. Coming to the door, he threw it open and took a step toward the bed. As we already know, it was empty. The discovery was something of a shock to the farmer and for the moment he stood stock-still, gazing at the bed and feeling under the covers to make certain that his nephew was not really there. \"Gone!\" he muttered at last. \"He must be downstairs. More\u0027n likely he went down to git somethin\u0027 to eat. Wait till I catch him! I\u0027ll tan him well!\" Hoping to catch Nat unawares, he tiptoed his way down the stairs and entered the living room. Then he passed to the kitchen and the shed, and came back to peer into the parlor. Not a trace of the lad was to be found anywhere. \"I certainly heard him,\" he reasoned. \"I certainly did.\" \"Mr. Balberry!\" The call came from the housekeeper. \"Are you up?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"Oh, all right.\" \"But it ain\u0027t all right! Nat\u0027s up too.\" \"Is he down there with you?\" \"No, I don\u0027t know at all where he is. I\u0027m a-lookin\u0027 fer him.\" By this time Mrs. Felton\u0027s curiosity was aroused and she lost no time in slipping on her wrapper. When she came down she brought with her a lamp. \"Where do you suppose he went?\" she asked. \"How do I know?\" snarled Abner Balberry. The housekeeper happened to glance into the pantry. She was about to utter an exclamation, but checked herself. \"What did you say, Mrs. Felton?\" \"I—I didn\u0027t say anything.\" \"He ain\u0027t in there, is he?\" \"No.\" \"Has he been at the victuals?\" \"Not—not very much,\" stammered the housekeeper. \"Humph! I guess he ate as much as he wanted. Jest wait till I catch him—I\u0027ll tan him harder than he was ever tanned before!\" \"Maybe he went to bed again.\" \"No, I jest looked into his room.\" Abner Balberry unlocked the kitchen door and stepped out into the dooryard. As he did this he caught sight of somebody running swiftly down the road. \"Hi! Stop!\" he yelled. \"Stop, Nat, do you hear?\" To this there was no answer, and the fleeing individual merely ran the faster. \"Was it Nat?\" asked the housekeeper. \"To be sure it was. Oh, wait till I lay my hands on him!\" And the farmer shook his fist at the figure that was fast disappearing in the gloom. \"What\u0027s that light in the barn?\" demanded Mrs. Felton, an instant later. \"Light? Where?\" \"Up in the haymow.\" Abner Balberry gave a glance toward the structure. \"The barn\u0027s afire!\" he screamed. \"Thet good-fer-nuthin\u0027 boy has set the place on fire!\" \"Oh! oh!\" screamed the housekeeper, and began to tremble from head to feet, for to her mind a fire was the most dreadful thing that could happen. \"I\u0027ve got to git thet fire out,\" said the farmer, and ran toward the barn with all speed. \"Be careful, or you\u0027ll be burnt up!\" screamed Mrs. Felton. \"Go on an\u0027 git the water pails!\" said the farmer. \"Fill everything with water. An\u0027 bring a rag carpet, an\u0027 I\u0027ll soak thet too!\" He already had an old patch of carpet used at the doorstep in his hand, and this he soused in the watering trough as he passed. Then he ran into the open barn and mounted to the loft. The fire was in a patch of hay at one end of the loft, close to an open window. Regardless of his personal safety, Abner Balberry leaped in and threw part of the hay out of the window. Then he began to beat out the fire with the water-soaked carpet. \"Here\u0027s some water,\" came timidly from below, and Mrs. Felton appeared with two pails full to the brim. He took these upstairs and dashed them on the flames. \"You look out or you\u0027ll be burnt up!\" cried the housekeeper. She was trembling to such a degree that she could scarcely stand. \"Git some more water,\" was Abner Balberry\u0027s only reply. The thought that his barn might be totally destroyed filled him with dread, for there was no insurance on the structure—he being too miserly to pay the premium demanded by the insurance company. More water was procured by Mrs. Felton, and at last it was apparent that the farmer was getting the best of the fire. He worked hard and did not seem to mind the fact that his eyebrows were singed and his hands slightly blistered. \"There! now I\u0027ve got it!\" he sighed at last. \"Are you sure?\" asked the housekeeper in a faint voice. \"Yes, but I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to hunt around fer sparks. Git some more water.\" Additional water was soon at hand, and Abner Balberry began a minute search of the whole loft, on the lookout for stray sparks. A few were found and extinguished, and then the excitement came to an end. \"How thankful I am that the barn didn\u0027t burn down,\" said the housekeeper, as the farmer came below and began to bathe his face and hands. \"It was hot work.\" \"Are you burnt much?\" \"More\u0027n I want to be. Jest wait till I catch Nat!\" \"Do you think——\" began the housekeeper. \"O\u0027 course I do!\" snorted Abner Balberry. \"Didn\u0027t I see him a-runnin\u0027 away from the barn?\" \"I never thought Nat would be wicked enough to set a barn on fire.\" \"He was mad because I wouldn\u0027t give him no supper. He\u0027s a young rascal, he is!\" \"But to burn a barn!\" \"Thet boy has got to be taken in hand, Mrs. Felton. I\u0027ve let him have his own way too much. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to lay down the law good an\u0027 hard after this.\" \"Maybe he won\u0027t come back,\" suggested the housekeeper. This thought startled the farmer and he lost no time in finishing his washing. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 after him,\" he announced. \"If he thinks to run away I\u0027ll put a spoke in his wheel putty quick.\" Taking another look around, to make certain that the fire was really out, Abner Balberry brought out one of his horses and hitched the animal to a buckboard, in the meantime sending the housekeeper back to the house to get his hat and coat. \"Where do you suppose you\u0027ll find him?\" asked Mrs. Felton. \"Somewhere along the road most likely.\" \"Maybe he\u0027ll hide on you.\" \"He had better not. If he does that, I\u0027ll call on the squire about him.\" \"Can you do that?\" \"O\u0027 course I can. Didn\u0027t he try to burn down the barn? The squire can make out a warrant for his arrest.\" \"It would be awful to have him arrested.\" \"Well, he brought it on himself,\" answered Abner Balberry, doggedly. \"He had no right to try to set the barn afire. Next thing you know, Mrs. Felton, he\u0027ll be a-trying to burn us up in our beds.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t think Nat would be as bad as that.\" \"You don\u0027t know thet boy as well as I do. He\u0027s sly an\u0027 stubborn, and he\u0027ll do \u0027most anything when he\u0027s crossed. But I\u0027ll fix him! Jest you wait an\u0027 see!\" \"How far will you follow him?\" \"As far as it\u0027s necessary. If he thinks he can git away from me he\u0027ll find out, sooner or later, he is mistaken.\" \"You don\u0027t know when you\u0027ll be back?\" \"No. It may be I\u0027ll have to wait in town till the squire opens his office—that is, if I can\u0027t find Nat.\" \"But you are going to look for him yourself first?\" \"Yes.\" With this answer Abner Balberry drove off in the darkness. Mrs. Felton watched him and heaved a long and deep sigh. \"Too bad!\" she murmured. \"If he catches Nat it will surely go hard with that boy. Well, I didn\u0027t think he was bad enough to set fire to a barn!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81816.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
