{"id":19499,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV THE PAPERS IN THE TRUNK","content":"Nat now asked for his uncle and was told that his relative was at the barn. Placing his dress-suit case in the house, he walked down to the barn. In the meantime Sam Price had driven off. \"Uncle Abner, where are you?\" \"Who\u0027s thet a-callin\u0027 me?\" came from the farmer, as he looked forth from one of the horse stalls. \"I\u0027ve come to ask you for a job,\" went on Nat, lightly. \"Nat! How be you?\" Abner came and shook hands. \"Want a job? Is it all up in New York?\" \"No, uncle, I was only fooling. I came home for a vacation of a couple of days, that\u0027s all.\" \"Well, you\u0027re welcome, Nat. But it must cost money to travel so far for jest two days\u0027 vacation.\" \"I came for another purpose, too. Do you remember those old papers in the trunk in the garret?\" \"Those thet belonged to your father an\u0027 grandfather?\" \"Yes. Well, I am going to look them over and see if they are of any value.\" \"Ain\u0027t nuthin\u0027 of any use, Nat. I looked over \u0027em myself, one rainy day when I didn\u0027t have nuthin\u0027 else to do.\" \"Mr. Garwell thinks some of them might be valuable.\" \"Does he know about \u0027em?\" \"He only knows what I told him.\" \"The old debts is all outlawed.\" \"But there are other papers—something about some land grandfather had an interest in.\" \"I don\u0027t know nuthin\u0027 about that. It\u0027s so long ago, I don\u0027t believe they are worth a cent.\" \"Well, it won\u0027t do any harm to look them over, and show them to Mr. Garwell,\" returned our hero. It was approaching the noon hour, and in honor of Nat\u0027s arrival, Mrs. Balberry prepared an extra good dinner, of which the boy partook freely. It was plainly to be seen that the former widow was the ruler of the house, and that she compelled Abner Balberry to be far more liberal than had been his habit in years gone by. \"Have another piece of pie, Nat,\" said the lady of the house, graciously. \"Thank you, but I\u0027ve had enough,\" answered Nat. \"Better save what\u0027s left for to-morrow,\" suggested Abner Balberry. \"If Nat wants another piece, he shall have it,\" was the lady\u0027s quick answer. \"Oh, certainly! certainly!\" \"Ma, I want another piece,\" came promptly from Fred. \"You\u0027ve had two pieces already, Fred.\" \"I want another.\" \"Not to-day.\" \"Just a little piece!\" \"Not another mouthful!\" And Mrs. Balberry placed the remainder of the pie in the cupboard. \"I can\u0027t never have nothing!\" cried Fred, kicking the leg of the table. \"You\u0027ll have a box on the ears, Fred Guff, if you don\u0027t behave yourself,\" answered his mother, and then there was silence. After dinner, Nat talked with his uncle for a while, and then putting on an old coat, went up into the dusty garret, and hauled out the old trunk. It was strapped, but not locked, so he had no trouble in opening it. \"What are you going to do?\" asked Fred, who had followed him. \"Look over some papers,\" answered our hero, briefly. \"Want me to help you?\" \"No.\" \"What are you going to do with the papers?\" \"Take some of them to the city with me.\" \"Are they yours?\" \"Yes.\" \"Say, don\u0027t you think it would be a good plan for me to go to the city and git a job at ten dollars a week?\" went on Fred, sitting down on the top garret step. \"Yes, if you could get the ten-dollar job.\" \"Why can\u0027t I git it? You got it.\" \"I was lucky, that\u0027s all, Fred. Before I got it I might have starved to death.\" \"Huh! Couldn\u0027t you git me a job with your boss?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"I\u0027m just as smart as you are, Nat Nason.\" To this our hero made no reply. He had brought out some of the papers, and was looking them over with much interest. \"If you don\u0027t want to help me git a job, I\u0027ll git one on my own hook,\" continued Fred, who was as dull as he considered himself bright. \"Well, you have a right to do as you please,\" said Nat. \"But please leave me alone now, Fred; I want to read these very carefully.\" \"Huh! I\u0027m going to stay in the garret as long as I please.\" Nat said no more, and Fred began to kick the step upon which he was sitting. Then, he began to thump on the rafters of the garret, bringing down some dirt on Nat\u0027s head. \"Stop that, Fred!\" cried our hero, sharply. \"Stop it, I say!\" \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to stop.\" \"If you don\u0027t stop, I\u0027ll put you downstairs, first thing you know.\" \"You can\u0027t do it.\" \"Yes, I can.\" \"Do you want to fight?\" demanded Fred, rising and squaring off. \"No, but I want you to leave me alone.\" \"I ain\u0027t touched you.\" \"No, but you were knocking the dirt down on me. Why can\u0027t you leave me alone?\" \"I\u0027ve got as much right in this garret as you have, that\u0027s why.\" \"You are mean.\" \"Don\u0027t you call me mean!\" blustered Fred, and coming closer, he hit Nat on the shoulder. At once our hero hit back, and Fred received a thump in the mouth that caused him to topple backwards. \"Don\u0027t!\" he screamed. \"Don\u0027t—don\u0027t hit me again.\" \"Now, are you going to leave me alone?\" demanded Nat. \"I\u0027ll tell my ma on you.\" \"If you do, I shall tell her how you annoyed me,\" answered Nat. \"Come down in the barnyard and I\u0027ll fight with you,\" said Fred, but, as he spoke, he retreated down the stairs. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, Fred. Behave yourself, and we\u0027ll get along all right,\" said Nat, and then Fred passed to the lower floor, banging the stairway door after him. There was a hook on the door, and this he fastened after him. \"Now, Nat can stay in the garret till I let him out,\" he muttered to himself. When left to himself, Nat dragged the old trunk to one of the windows of the garret, and then began a systematic investigation of all the papers the box contained. He soon learned that the majority of the documents were of no importance, but there were half a dozen which looked of possible value, and these he placed in his pocket. Two of the sheets referred directly to the land in New York City. \"I hope these are what Mr. Garwell is looking for,\" he said to himself. Having put the trunk back where it belonged, Nat started to go below, only to find the door hooked fast from the other side. \"Fred!\" he called out loudly. \"Fred, open the door!\" \"Ha! ha! Nat Nason, how do you like being a prisoner?\" came from Fred, who had been resting on a bed in a nearby room. \"I want you to open the door.\" \"What will you give me if I do?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll give you if you don\u0027t!\" cried Nat, angrily. \"What?\" \"A good thrashing.\" \"You can\u0027t do it.\" \"Are you going to open the door?\" \"No.\" Fred had scarcely spoken when Nat pressed on the door, and the hook flew from its fastening. As the door burst open, Nat leaped from the stairway and caught the other boy by the collar. \"Now, then, that for locking me in,\" he cried, and boxed Fred\u0027s ears soundly. \"Stop!\" roared Fred. \"Stop, Nat Nason.\" \"Will you behave yourself after this, and leave me alone?\" \"Yes! yes!\" \"Then, see that you do,\" went on Nat, and flung the other boy from him. Fred picked himself up in a hurry, and ran below. He vowed he would get square, but during Nat\u0027s stay at the farm he could not muster up courage to do so. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2971/81836.html","bookId":373,"book":{"id":373,"title":"From Farm to Fortune or Nat Nason\u0027s Strange Experience","description":"简介： Nat Nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition.
