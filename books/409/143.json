{"id":17550,"no":143,"title":"APPENDIX.","content":"The Family of Frontenac. Count Frontenac\u0027s grandfather was Antoine de Buade, Seigneur de Frontenac, Baron de Palluau, Conseiller d\u0027état, Chevalier des Ordres du Roy, son premier ma?tre d\u0027h?tel, et gouverneur de St. Germain-en-Laye. By Jeanne Secontat, his wife, he had, among other children, Henri de Buade, Chevalier, Baron de Palluau et mestre de camp (colonel) du régiment de Navarre, who, by his wife Anne Phélippeaux, daughter of Raymond Phélippeaux, Secretary of State, had, among other children, LOUIS DE BUADE, Comte de Palluau et Frontenac, Seigneur de l\u0027Isle-Savary, mestre de camp du régiment de Normandie, maréchal de camp dans les armées du Roy, et gouverneur et lieutenant général en Canada, Acadie, Isle de Terreneuve, et autres pays de la France septentrionale. Louis de Buade had by his wife, Anne de La Grange-Trianon, one son, Fran?ois Louis, killed in Germany, while in the service of the king, and leaving no issue. The foregoing is drawn from a comparison of the following authorities, all of which will be found in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, where the examination was made: Mémoires de Marolles, abbé de Villeloin, II. 201; L\u0027Hermite-Souliers, Histoire Généalogique de la Noblesse de Touraine; Du Chesne, Recherches Historiques de l\u0027Ordre du Saint-Esprit; Morin, Statuts de l\u0027Ordre du Saint-Esprit; Marolles de Villeloin, Histoire des Anciens Comtes d\u0027Anjou; Père Anselme, Grands Officiers de la Couronne; Pinard, Chronologie Historique-militaire; Table de la Gazette de France. In this matter of the Frontenac genealogy, 454 I am much indebted to the kind offices of my friend, James Gordon Clarke, Esq. When, in 1600, Henry IV. was betrothed to Marie de Medicis, Frontenac, grandfather of the governor of Canada, described as \"ung des plus antiens serviteurs du roy,\" was sent to Florence by the king to carry his portrait to his affianced bride. Mémoires de Philippe Hurault, 448 (Petitot). The appointment of Frontenac to the post, esteemed as highly honorable, of ma?tre d\u0027h?tel in the royal household, immediately followed. There is a very curious book, the journal of Jean Héroard, a physician charged with the care of the infant Dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII., born in 1601. It records every act of the future monarch: his screaming and kicking in the arms of his nurses, his refusals to be washed and dressed, his resistance when his hair was combed; how he scratched his governess, and called her names; how he quarrelled with the children of his father\u0027s mistresses, and at the age of four declined to accept them as brothers and sisters; how his mother slighted him; and how his father sometimes caressed, sometimes teased, and sometimes corrected him with his own hand. The details of the royal nursery are, we may add, astounding for their grossness; and the language and the manners amid which the infant monarch grew up were worthy of the days of Rabelais. Frontenac and his children appear frequently, and not unfavorably, on the pages of this singular diary. Thus, when the Dauphin was three years old, the king, being in bed, took him and a young Frontenac of about the same age, set them before him, and amused himself by making them rally each other in their infantile language. The infant Frontenac had a trick of stuttering, which the Dauphin caught from him, and retained for a long time. Again, at the age of five, the Dauphin, armed with a little gun, played at soldier with two of the Frontenac children in the hall at St. Germain. They assaulted a town, the rampart being represented by a balustrade before the fireplace. \"The Dauphin,\" writes the journalist, \"said that he would be a musketeer, and yet he spoke sharply to the others 455 who would not do as he wished. The king said to him, \u0027My boy, you are a musketeer, but you speak like a general.\u0027\" Long after, when the Dauphin was in his fourteenth year, the following entry occurs in the physician\u0027s diary:— St. Germain, Sunday, 22d (July, 1614). \"He (the Dauphin) goes to the chapel of the terrace, then mounts his horse and goes to find M. de Souvré and M. de Frontenac, whom he surprises as they were at breakfast at the small house near the quarries. At half past one, he mounts again, in hunting boots; goes to the park with M. de Frontenac as a guide, chases a stag, and catches him. It was his first stag-hunt.\" Of Henri de Buade, father of the governor of Canada, but little is recorded. When in Paris, he lived, like his son after him, on the Quai des Célestins, in the parish of St. Paul. His son, Count Frontenac, was born in 1620, seven years after his father\u0027s marriage. Apparently his birth took place elsewhere than in Paris, for it is not recorded with those of Henri de Buade\u0027s other children, on the register of St. Paul (Jal, Dictionnaire Critique, Biographique, et d\u0027Histoire). The story told by Tallemant des Réaux concerning his marriage (see page 6) seems to be mainly true. Colonel Jal says: \"On con?oit que j\u0027ai pu être tenté de conna?tre ce qu\u0027il y a de vrai dans les récits de Saint-Simon et de Tallemant des Réaux; voici ce qu\u0027après bien des recherches, j\u0027ai pu apprendre. Mlle. La Grange fit, en effet, un mariage à demi secret. Ce ne fut point à sa paroisse que fut bénie son union avec M. de Frontenac, mais dans une des petites églises de la Cité qui avaient le privilège de recevoir les amants qui s\u0027unissaient malgré leurs parents, et ceux qui regularisaient leur position et s\u0027épousaient un peu avant—quelquefois après—la naissance d\u0027un enfant. Ce fut à St. Pierre-aux-B?ufs que, le mercredy, 28 Octobre, 1648, \u0027Messire Louis de Buade, Chevalier, comte de Frontenac, conseiller du Roy en ses conseils, mareschal des camps et armées de S. M., et maistre de camp du régiment du Normandie,\u0027 épousa \u0027demoiselle Anne de La Grange, fille de Messire Charles de La Grange, conseiller du Roy et maistre des comptes\u0027 de la paroisse de St. Paul comme M. de Frontenac, \u0027en vertu de la dispense … obtenue 456 de M. l\u0027official de Paris par laquelle il est permis au Sr. de Buade et demoiselle de La Grange de célébrer leur marriage suyvant et conformément à la permission qu\u0027ils en ont obtenue du Sr. Coquerel, vicaire de St. Paul, devant le premier curé ou vicaire sur ce requis, en gardant les solennités en ce cas requises et accoutumées.\u0027\" Jal then gives the signatures to the act of marriage, which, except that of the bride, are all of the Frontenac family.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2857/78945.html","bookId":409,"book":{"id":409,"title":"Pioneers Of France In The New World: France and England in North America","description":"简介： The springs of American civilization, unlike those of the elder world, lie revealed in the clear light of History.
