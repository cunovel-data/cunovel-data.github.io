{"id":17551,"no":144,"title":"Part VII PREFACE.","content":"This book, forming Part VI. of the series called France and England in North America, fills the gap between Part V., \"Count Frontenac,\" and Part VII., \"Montcalm and Wolfe;\" so that the series now forms a continuous history of the efforts of France to occupy and control this continent. In the present volumes the nature of the subject does not permit an unbroken thread of narrative, and the unity of the book lies in its being throughout, in one form or another, an illustration of the singularly contrasted characters and methods of the rival claimants to North America. Like the rest of the series, this work is founded on original documents. The statements of secondary writers have been accepted only when found to conform to the evidence of contemporaries, whose writings have been sifted and collated with the greatest care. As extremists[Pg vi] on each side have charged me with favoring the other, I hope I have been unfair to neither. The manuscript material collected for the preparation of the series now complete forms about seventy volumes, most of them folios. These have been given by me from time to time to the Massachusetts Historical Society, in whose library they now are, open to the examination of those interested in the subjects of which they treat. The collection was begun forty-five years ago, and its formation has been exceedingly slow, having been retarded by difficulties which seemed insurmountable, and for years were so in fact. Hence the completion of the series has required twice the time that would have sufficed under less unfavorable conditions.
