LA SALLE\u0027S MEMOIR. One of the most curious monuments of La Salle\u0027s time is a long memoir, written by a person who made his acquaintance at Paris in the summer of 1678, when, as we shall soon see, he had returned to France in prosecution of his plans. The writer knew the Sulpitian Galinée,[75] who, as he says, had a very high opinion of La Salle; and he was also in close relations with the discoverer\u0027s patron, the Prince de Conti.[76] He says that he had ten or twelve interviews with La Salle; and, becoming interested in him and in that which he communicated, he wrote down the substance of his conversation. The paper is divided into two [Pg 107] parts: the first, called \"Mémoire sur Mr. de la Salle,\" is devoted to the state of affairs in Canada, and chiefly to the Jesuits; the second, entitled \"Histoire de Mr. de la Salle,\" is an account of the discoverer\u0027s life, or as much of it as the writer had learned from him.[77] Both parts bear throughout the internal evidence of being what they profess to be; but they embody the statements of a man of intense partisan feeling, transmitted through the mind of another person in sympathy with him, and evidently sharing his prepossessions. In one respect, however, the paper is of unquestionable historical value; for it gives us a vivid and not an exaggerated picture of the bitter strife of parties which then raged in Canada, and which was destined to tax to the utmost the vast energy and fortitude of La Salle. At times, the memoir is fully sustained by contemporary evidence; but often, again, it rests on its own unsupported authority. I give an abstract of its statements as I find them. The following is the writer\u0027s account of La Salle: \"All those among my friends who have seen him find him a man of great intelligence and sense. He rarely speaks of any subject except when questioned about it, and his words are very few and very precise. He distinguishes perfectly between that which he knows with certainly and that which he knows with some mingling of doubt. When he does not know, he does [Pg 108] not hesitate to avow it; and though I have heard him say the same thing more than five or six times, when persons were present who had not heard it before, he always said it in the same manner. In short, I never heard anybody speak whose words carried with them more marks of truth.\"[78] JESUIT ASCENDENCY. After mentioning that he is thirty-three or thirty-four years old, and that he has been twelve years in America, the memoir declares that he made the following statements: that the Jesuits are masters at Quebec; that the bishop is their creature, and does nothing but in concert with them;[79] that he is not well inclined towards the Récollets,[80] who have little [Pg 109] credit, but who are protected by Frontenac; that in Canada the Jesuits think everybody an enemy to religion who is an enemy to them; that, though they refused absolution to all who sold brandy to the Indians, they sold it themselves, and that he, La Salle, had himself detected them in it;[81] that the bishop laughs at the orders of the King when they do not agree with the wishes of the Jesuits; that the Jesuits dismissed one of their servants named Robert, because he told of their trade in brandy; that Albanel,[82] in particular, carried on a great fur-trade, and that the Jesuits have built their college in part from the profits of this kind of traffic; that they [Pg 110] admitted that they carried on a trade, but denied that they gained so much by it as was commonly supposed.[83] FEMALE INQUISITORS. The memoir proceeds to affirm that they trade largely with the Sioux at Ste. Marie, and with other tribes at Michilimackinac, and that they are masters of the trade of that region, where the forts are in their possession.[84] An Indian said, in full council, at Quebec, that he had prayed and been a Christian as long as the Jesuits would stay and teach him, but since no more beaver were left in his country, the missionaries were gone also. The Jesuits, pursues the memoir, will have no priests but themselves in their missions, and call them all Jansenists, not excepting the priests of St. Sulpice. The bishop is next accused of harshness and intolerance, as well as of growing rich by tithes, and even by trade, in which it is affirmed he has a covert interest.[85] It is added that there exists in Quebec, under the auspices of the Jesuits, an association [Pg 111] called the Sainte Famille, of which Madame Bourdon[86] is superior. They meet in the cathedral every Thursday, with closed doors, where they relate to each other—as they are bound by a vow to do—all they have learned, whether good or evil, concerning other people, during the week. It is a sort of female inquisition, for the benefit of the Jesuits, the secrets of whose friends, it is said, are kept, while no such discretion is observed with regard to persons not of their party.[87] [Pg 112] Here follow a series of statements which it is needless to repeat, as they do not concern La Salle. They relate to abuse of the confessional, hostility to other priests, hostility to civil authorities, and over-hasty baptisms, in regard to which La Salle is reported to have made a comparison, unfavorable to the Jesuits, between them and the Récollets and Sulpitians. PLOTS AGAINST LA SALLE. We now come to the second part of the memoir, entitled \"History of Monsieur de la Salle.\" After stating that he left France at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two, with the purpose of attempting some new discovery, it makes the statements repeated in a former chapter, concerning his discovery of the Ohio, the Illinois, and possibly the Mississippi. It then mentions the building of Fort Frontenac, and says that one object of it was to prevent the Jesuits from becoming undisputed masters of the fur-trade.[88] Three years ago, it pursues, La Salle came to France, and obtained a grant of the fort; and it proceeds to give examples of the means used by the party opposed to him to injure his good name and bring him within reach of the law. Once, when he was at Quebec, the farmer of the King\u0027s revenue, one of the richest [Pg 113] men in the place, was extremely urgent in his proffers of hospitality, and at length, though he knew La Salle but slightly, persuaded him to lodge in his house. He had been here but a few days when his host\u0027s wife began to enact the part of the wife of Potiphar, and this with so much vivacity that on one occasion La Salle was forced to take an abrupt leave, in order to avoid an infringement of the laws of hospitality. As he opened the door, he found the husband on the watch, and saw that it was a plot to entrap him.[89] Another attack, of a different character, though in the same direction, was soon after made. The remittances which La Salle received from the various members and connections of his family were sent through the hands of his brother, Abbé Cavelier, from whom his enemies were, therefore, very eager to alienate him. To this end, a report was made to reach the priest\u0027s ears that La Salle had seduced a young woman, with whom he was living in an open and scandalous manner at Fort Frontenac. The effect of this device exceeded the wishes of its contrivers; for the priest, aghast at what he had heard, set out for the fort, to administer his fraternal rebuke, but on arriving, in place of the expected abomination, found his brother, assisted by two Récollet friars, ruling with edifying propriety over a most exemplary household. [Pg 114] Thus far the memoir. From passages in some of La Salle\u0027s letters, it may be gathered that Abbé Cavelier gave him at times no little annoyance. In his double character of priest and elder brother, he seems to have constituted himself the counsellor, monitor, and guide of a man who, though many years his junior, was in all respects incomparably superior to him, as the sequel will show. This must have been almost insufferable to a nature like that of La Salle, who, nevertheless, was forced to arm himself with patience, since his brother held the purse-strings. On one occasion his forbearance was put to a severe proof, when, wishing to marry a damsel of good connections in the colony, Abbé Cavelier saw fit for some reason to interfere, and prevented the alliance.[90] INTRIGUES OF THE JESUITS. To resume the memoir. It declares that the Jesuits procured an ordinance from the Supreme Council prohibiting traders from going into the Indian country, in order that they, the Jesuits, being already established there in their missions, might carry on trade without competition. But La Salle induced a good number of the Iroquois to settle around his fort; thus bringing the trade to his own door, without breaking the ordinance. These Iroquois, he is further reported to have said, were very fond of him, and aided him in rebuilding the fort with cut stone. The Jesuits told the Iroquois on the south side of the lake, where they were established [Pg 115] as missionaries, that La Salle was strengthening his defences with the view of making war on them. They and the intendant, who was their creature, endeavored to embroil the Iroquois with the French in order to ruin La Salle; writing to him at the same time that he was the bulwark of the country, and that he ought to be always on his guard. They also tried to persuade Frontenac that it was necessary to raise men and prepare for war. La Salle suspected them; and seeing that the Iroquois, in consequence of their intrigues, were in an excited state, he induced the governor to come to Fort Frontenac to pacify them. He accordingly did so; and a council was held, which ended in a complete restoration of confidence on the part of the Iroquois.[91] At this council they accused the two Jesuits, Bruyas and Pierron,[92] of spreading reports that the French were preparing to attack them. La Salle thought that the [Pg 116] object of the intrigue was to make the Iroquois jealous of him, and engage Frontenac in expenses which would offend the King. After La Salle and the governor had lost credit by the rupture, the Jesuits would come forward as pacificators, in the full assurance that they could restore quiet, and appear in the attitude of saviors of the colony. La Salle, pursues his reporter, went on to say that about this time a quantity of hemlock and verdigris was given him in a salad; and that the guilty person was a man in his employ named Nicolas Perrot, otherwise called Jolyc?ur, who confessed the crime.[93] The memoir adds that La Salle, who recovered from the effects of the poison, wholly exculpates the Jesuits. This attempt, which was not, as we shall see, the only one of the kind made against La Salle, is alluded to by him in a letter to a friend at Paris, [Pg 117] written in Canada when he was on the point of departure on his great expedition to descend the Mississippi. The following is an extract from it: LA SALLE EXCULPATES THE JESUITS. \"I hope to give myself the honor of sending you a more particular account of this enterprise when it shall have had the success which I hope for it; but I have need of a strong protection for its support. It traverses the commercial operations of certain persons, who will find it hard to endure it. They intended to make a new Paraguay in these parts, and the route which I close against them gave them facilities for an advantageous correspondence with Mexico. This check will infallibly be a mortification to them; and you know how they deal with whatever opposes them. Nevertheless, I am bound to render them the justice to say that the poison which was given me was not at all of their instigation. The person who was conscious of the guilt, believing that I was their enemy because he saw that our sentiments were opposed, thought to exculpate himself by accusing them, and I confess that at the time I was not sorry to have this indication of their ill-will; but having afterwards carefully examined the affair, I clearly discovered the falsity of the accusation which this rascal had made against them. I nevertheless pardoned him, in order not to give notoriety to the affair; as the mere suspicion might sully their reputation, to which I should scrupulously avoid doing the slightest injury unless I thought it necessary to the good of the public, and unless the fact were fully proved. Therefore, [Pg 118] Monsieur, if anybody shared the suspicion which I felt, oblige me by undeceiving him.\"[94] This letter, so honorable to La Salle, explains the statement made in the memoir, that, notwithstanding his grounds of complaint against the Jesuits, he continued to live on terms of courtesy with them, entertained them at his fort, and occasionally corresponded with them. The writer asserts, however, that they intrigued with his men to induce them to desert,—employing for this purpose a young man named Deslauriers, whom they sent to him with letters of recommendation. La Salle took him into his service; but he soon after escaped, with several other men, and took refuge in the Jesuit missions.[95] The object of the intrigue is said to have been the reduction of La Salle\u0027s garrison to a number less than that which he was bound to maintain, thus exposing him to a forfeiture of his title of possession. RENEWED INTRIGUES. He is also stated to have declared that Louis Joliet was an impostor,[96] and a donné of the Jesuits,—that [Pg 119] is, a man who worked for them without pay; and, further, that when he, La Salle, came to court to ask for privileges enabling him to pursue his discoveries, the Jesuits represented in advance to the minister Colbert that his head was turned, and that he was fit for nothing but a mad-house. It was only by the aid of influential friends that he was at length enabled to gain an audience. Here ends this remarkable memoir, which, criticise it as we may, does not exaggerate the jealousies and enmities that beset the path of the discoverer. FOOTNOTES: [75] Ante, p. 17. [76] Louis-Armand de Bourbon, second Prince de Conti. The author of the memoir seems to have been Abbé Renaudot, a learned churchman. [77] Extracts from this have already been given in connection with La Salle\u0027s supposed discovery of the Mississippi. Ante, p. 29. [78] \"Tous ceux de mes amis qui l\u0027ont vu luy trouve beaucoup d\u0027esprit et un très-grand sens; il ne parle guère que des choses sur lesquelles on l\u0027interroge; il les dit en très-peu de mots et très-bien circonstanciées; il distingue parfaitement ce qu\u0027il scait avec certitude, de ce qu\u0027il scait avec quelque mélange de doute. Il avoue sans aucune fa?on ne pas savoir ce qu\u0027il ne scait pas, et quoyque je luy aye ouy dire plus de cinq ou six fois les mesme choses à l\u0027occasion de quelques personnes qui ne les avaient point encore entendues, je les luy ay toujours ouy dire de la mesme manière. En un mot je n\u0027ay jamais ouy parler personne dont les paroles portassent plus de marques de vérité.\" [79]] \"Il y a une autre chose qui me déplait, qui est l\u0027entière dépendence dans laquelle les Prêtres du Séminaire de Québec et le Grand Vicaire de l\u0027Evêque sont pour les Pères Jésuites, car il ne fait pas la moindre chose sans leur ordre; ce qui fait qu\u0027indirectement ils sont les ma?tres de ce qui regarde le spirituel, qui, comme vous savez, est une grande machine pour remuer tout le reste.\"—Lettre de Frontenac à Colbert, 2 Nov., 1672. [80] \"Ces réligieux [les Récollets] sont fort protégés partout par le comte de Frontenac, gouverneur du pays, et à cause de cela assez maltraités par l\u0027évesque, parceque la doctrine de l\u0027évesque et des Jésuites est que les affaires de la Réligion chrestienne n\u0027iront point bien dans ce pays-là que quand le gouverneur sera créature des Jésuites, ou que l\u0027évesque sera gouverneur.\"—Mémoire sur Mr. de la Salle. [81] \"Ils [les Jésuites] refusent l\u0027absolution à ceux qui ne veulent pas promettre de n\u0027en plus vendre [de l\u0027eau-de-vie], et s\u0027ils meurent en cet état, ils les privent de la sépulture ecclésiastique; au contraire ils se permettent à eux-mêmes sans aucune difficulté ce mesme trafic quoique toute sorte de trafic soit interdite à tous les ecclésiastiques par les ordonnances du Roy, et par une bulle expresse du Pape. La Bulle et les ordonnances sont notoires, et quoyqu\u0027ils cachent le trafic qu\u0027ils font d\u0027eau-de-vie, M. de la Salle prétend qu\u0027il ne l\u0027est pas moins; qu\u0027outre la notoriété il en a des preuves certaines, et qu\u0027il les a surpris dans ce trafic, et qu\u0027ils luy ont tendu des pièges pour l\u0027y surprendre.... Ils ont chassé leur valet Robert à cause qu\u0027il révéla qu\u0027ils en traitaient jour et nuit.\"—Ibid. The writer says that he makes this last statement, not on the authority of La Salle, but on that of a memoir made at the time when the intendant, Talon, with whom he elsewhere says that he was well acquainted, returned to France. A great number of particulars are added respecting the Jesuit trade in furs. [82] Albanel was prominent among the Jesuit explorers at this time. He is best known by his journey up the Saguenay to Hudson\u0027s Bay in 1672. [83] \"Pour vous parler franchement, ils [les Jésuites] songent autant à la conversion du Castor qu\u0027à celle des ames.\"—Lettre de Frontenac à Colbert, 2 Nov., 1672. In his despatch of the next year, he says that the Jesuits ought to content themselves with instructing the Indians in their old missions, instead of neglecting them to make new ones in countries where there are \"more beaver-skins to gain than souls to save.\" [84] These forts were built by them, and were necessary to the security of their missions. [85] Fran?ois Xavier de Laval-Montmorency, first bishop of Quebec, was a prelate of austere character. His memory is cherished in Canada by adherents of the Jesuits and all ultramontane Catholics. [86] This Madame Bourdon was the widow of Bourdon, the engineer (see \"The Jesuits in North America,\" 297). If we may credit the letters of Marie de l\u0027Incarnation, she had married him from a religious motive, in order to charge herself with the care of his motherless children; stipulating in advance that he should live with her, not as a husband, but as a brother. As may be imagined, she was regarded as a most devout and saint-like person. [87] \"Il y a dans Québec une congrégation de femmes et de filles qu\u0027ils [les Jésuites] appellent la sainte famille, dans laquelle on fait v?u sur les Saints Evangiles de dire tout ce qu\u0027on sait de bien et de mal des personnes qu\u0027on connoist. La Supérieure de cette compagnie s\u0027appelle Madame Bourdon; une Mde. d\u0027Ailleboust est, je crois, l\u0027assistante et une Mde. Charron, la Trésorière. La Compagnie s\u0027assemble tous les Jeudis dans la Cathédrale, à porte fermée, et là elles se disent les unes aux autres tout ce qu\u0027elles ont appris. C\u0027est une espèce d\u0027Inquisition contre toutes les personnes qui ne sont pas unies avec les Jésuites. Ces personnes sont accusées de tenir secret ce qu\u0027elles apprennent de mal des personnes de leur party et de n\u0027avoir pas la mesme discretion pour les autres.\"—Mémoire sur M^r. de la Salle. The Madame d\u0027Ailleboust mentioned above was a devotee like Madame Bourdon, and, in one respect, her history was similar. See \"The Jesuits in North America,\" 360. The association of the Sainte Famille was founded by the Jesuit Chaumonot at Montreal in 1663. Laval, Bishop of Quebec, afterwards encouraged its establishment at that place; and, as Chaumonot himself writes, caused it to be attached to the cathedral. Vie de Chaumonot, 83. For its establishment at Montreal, see Faillon, Vie de Mlle. Mance, i. 233. \"Ils [les Jésuites] ont tous une si grande envie de savoir tout ce qui se fait dans les familles qu\u0027ils ont des Inspecteurs à gages dans la Ville, qui leur rapportent tout ce qui se fait dans les maisons,\" etc., etc.—Lettre de Frontenac au Ministre, 13 Nov., 1673. [88] Mention has been made (p. 88, note) of the report set on foot by the Jesuit Dablon, to prevent the building of the fort. [89] This story is told at considerable length, and the advances of the lady particularly described. [90] Letter of La Salle, in possession of M. Margry. [91] Louis XIV. alludes to this visit, in a letter to Frontenac, dated 28 April, 1677. \"I cannot but approve,\" he writes, \"of what you have done, in your voyage to Fort Frontenac, to reconcile the minds of the Five Iroquois Nations, and to clear yourself from the suspicions they had entertained, and from the motives that might induce them to make war.\" Frontenac\u0027s despatches of this year, as well as of the preceding and following years, are missing from the archives. In a memoir written in November, 1680, La Salle alludes to \"le désir que l\u0027on avoit que Monseigneur le Comte de Frontenac fit la guerre aux Iroquois.\" See Thomassy, Géologie Pratique de la Louisiane, 203. [92] Bruyas was about this time stationed among the Onondagas. Pierron was among the Senecas. He had lately removed to them from the Mohawk country. Relation des Jésuites, 1673-79, 140 (Shea). Bruyas was also for a long time among the Mohawks. [93] This puts the character of Perrot in a new light; for it is not likely that any other can be meant than the famous voyageur. I have found no mention elsewhere of the synonyme of Jolyc?ur. Poisoning was the current crime of the day, and persons of the highest rank had repeatedly been charged with it. The following is the passage:— \"Quoiqu\u0027il en soit, Mr. de la Salle se sentit quelque temps après empoisonné d\u0027une salade dans laquelle on avoit meslé du cigu?, qui est poison en ce pays là, et du verd de gris. Il en fut malade à l\u0027extrémité, vomissant presque continuellement 40 ou 50 jours après, et il ne réchappa que par la force extrême de sa constitution. Celuy qui luy donna le poison fut un nommé Nicolas Perrot, autrement Jolyc?ur, l\u0027un de ses domestiques.... Il pouvait faire mourir cet homme, qui a confessé son crime, mais il s\u0027est contenté de l\u0027enfermer les fers aux pieds.\"—Histoire de Mr. de la Salle. [94] The following words are underlined in the original: \"Je suis pourtant obligé de leur rendre une justice, que le poison qu\u0027on m\u0027avoit donné n\u0027éstoit point de leur instigation.\"—Lettre de La Salle au Prince de Conti, 31 Oct., 1678. [95] In a letter to the King, Frontenac mentions that several men who had been induced to desert from La Salle had gone to Albany, where the English had received them well. Lettre de Frontenac au Roy, 6 Nov., 1679. The Jesuits had a mission in the neighboring tribe of the Mohawks and elsewhere in New York. [96] This agrees with expressions used by La Salle in a memoir addressed by him to Frontenac in November, 1680. In this, he intimates his belief that Joliet went but little below the mouth of the Illinois, thus doing flagrant injustice to that brave explorer.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2857/78877.html","bookId":409,"book":{"id":409,"title":"Pioneers Of France In The New World: France and England in North America","description":"简介： The springs of American civilization, unlike those of the elder world, lie revealed in the clear light of History.
