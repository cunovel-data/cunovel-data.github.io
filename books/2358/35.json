{"id":68006,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"It was ten o\u0027clock in the evening when Alexandra arrived at the house at Dark Harbor. She had tried telephoning George there several times, but there had been no answer. She hoped he would not be angry because she had been detained. It had been a stupid mix-up. Early that afternoon, as Alexandra was leaving for Dark Harbor, the phone had rung. She had thought, I\u0027m late. Let it ring, and had gone out to the car. The maid had come hurrying after her.\n \"Mrs. Mellis! It\u0027s your sister. She says it is urgent.\"\n When Alexandra picked up the telephone, Eve said, \"Darling, I\u0027m in Washington, D.C. I\u0027m having a terrible problem. I have to see you.\"\n \"Of course,\" Alexandra said instantly. \"I\u0027m leaving for Dark Harbor now to meet George, but I\u0027ll be back Monday morning and - \"\n \"This can\u0027t wait.\" Eve sounded desperate. \"Will you meet me at La Guardia Airport? I\u0027ll be on the five o\u0027clock plane.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to, Eve, but I told George - \"\n \"This is an emergency, Alex. But, of course, if you\u0027re too busy...\"\n \"Wait! All right. I\u0027ll be there.\"\n \"Thanks, darling. I knew I could count on you.\"\n It was so seldom that Eve asked her for a favor, she could not refuse her. She would catch a later plane to the island. She telephoned George at the office to tell him she would be detained, but he was not in. She left a message with his secretary. An hour later she took a taxi to La Guardia in time to meet the five o\u0027clock plane from Washington. Eve was not on it. Alexandra waited for two hours, and there was still no sign of Eve. Alexandra had no idea where to reach Eve in Washington. Finally, because there was nothing else she could do, Alexandra took a plane to the island. Now as she approached Cedar Hill House, she found it dark. Surely George should have arrived by now. Alexandra went from room to room, turning on the lights.\n \"George?\"\n There was no sign of him. She telephoned her home in Manhattan. The maid answered.\n \"Is Mr. Mellis there?\" Alexandra asked.\n \"Why, no, Mrs. Mellis. He said you would both be away for the weekend.\"\n \"Thank you, Marie. He must have been detained somewhere.\"\n There had to be a logical reason for his absence. Obviously some business had come up at the last minute and, as usual, the partners had asked George to handle it. He would be along at any moment. She dialed Eve\u0027s number.\n \"Eve!\" Alexandra exclaimed. \"What on earth happened to you?\"\n \"What happened to you? I waited at Kennedy, and when you didn\u0027t show up - \"\n \"Kennedy! You said La Guardia.\"\n \"No, darling, Kennedy.\"\n \"But - \" It did not matter any longer. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Alexandra said. \"I must have misunderstood. Are you all right?\"\n Eve said, \"I am now. I\u0027ve had a hellish time. I got involved with a man who\u0027s a big political figure in Washington. He\u0027s insanely jealous and - \" She laughed. \"I can\u0027t go into the details over the telephone. The phone company will take out both our phones. I\u0027ll tell you all about it Monday.\"\n \"All right,\" Alexandra said. She was enormously relieved.\n \"Have a nice weekend,\" Eve told her. \"How\u0027s George?\"\n \"He\u0027s not here.\" Alexandra tried to keep the note of concern out of her voice. \"I suppose he got tied up on business and hasn\u0027t had a chance to call me.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hear from him soon. Good night, darling.\"\n \"Good night, Eve.\"\n Alexandra replaced the receiver and thought, It would be nice if Eve found someone really wonderful. Someone as good and kind as George. She looked at her watch. It was almost eleven o\u0027clock. Surely he would have had a chance to call by now. She picked up the telephone and dialed the number of the brokerage firm. There was no answer. She telephoned his club. No, they had not seen Mr. Mellis. By midnight, Alexandra was alarmed, and by one A.M. she was in a state of panic. She was not sure what to do. It was possible that George was out with a client and could not get to a telephone, or perhaps he had had to fly somewhere and had not been able to reach her before he left. There was some simple explanation. If she called the police and George walked in, she would feel like a fool.\n At 2:00 A.M. she telephoned the police. There was no police force on the island of Islesboro itself, and the closest station was in Waldo County.\n A sleepy voice said, \"Waldo County Sheriff\u0027s Department. Sergeant Lambert.\"\n \"This is Mrs. George Mellis at Cedar Hill House.\"\n \"Yes, Mrs. Mellis.\" The voice was instantly alert. \"What can I do for you?\"\n \"To tell you the truth, I\u0027m not sure,\" Alexandra said hesitantly. \"My husband was supposed to have met me at the house earlier this evening, and he - he hasn\u0027t shown up.\"\n \"I see.\" There were all kinds of implications in that phrase. The sergeant knew at least three reasons why a husband could be away from home at two A.M. in the morning: blondes, brunets and redheads.\n He said tactfully, \"Is it possible he was detained on business somewhere?\"\n \"He - he usually calls.\"\n \"Well, you know how it is, Mrs. Mellis. Sometimes you get in a situation where you can\u0027t call. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be hearing from him.\"\n Now she did feel like a fool. Of course there was nothing the police could do. She had read somewhere that a person had to be missing for twenty-four hours before the police would even start looking for him, and George was not missing, for heaven\u0027s sake. He was just late.\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right,\" Alexandra said into the telephone. \"I\u0027m sorry to have troubled you.\"\n \"Not at all, Mrs. Mellis. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027ll be on the seven o\u0027clock ferry first thing in the morning.\"\n He was not on the seven o\u0027clock ferry, or the one after that. Alexandra telephoned the Manhattan house again. George was not there.\n A feeling of disaster began to grip Alexandra. George had been in an accident; he was in a hospital somewhere, ill or dead. If only there had not been the mix-up with Eve at the airport. Perhaps George had arrived at the house, and when he found she was not there, he had gone. But that left too many things unexplained. He would have left a note. He could have surprised burglars and been attacked or kidnapped. Alexandra went through the house, room by room, looking for any possible clue. Everything was intact. She went down to the dock. The Corsair was there, safely moored.\n She telephoned the Waldo County Sheriff\u0027s Department again. Lieutenant Philip Ingram, a twenty-year veteran of the force, was on morning duty. He was already aware that George Mellis had not been home all night. It had been the chief topic of conversation around the station all morning, most of it ribald.\n Now he said to Alexandra, \"There\u0027s no trace of him at all, Mrs. Mellis? All right. I\u0027ll come out there myself.\" He knew it would be a waste of time. Her old man was probably tomcatting around in some alley. But when the Blackwells call, the peasants come running, he thought wryly. Anyway, this was a nice lady. He had met her a few times over the years.\n \"Back in an hour or so,\" he told the desk sergeant.\n Lieutenant Ingram listened to Alexandra\u0027s story, checked the house and the dock and reached the conclusion that Alexandra Mellis had a problem on her hands. George Mellis was to have met his wife the evening before at Dark Harbor, but he had not shown up. While it was not Lieutenant Ingram\u0027s problem, he knew it would do him no harm to be helpful to a member of the Blackwell family. Ingram telephoned the island airport and the ferry terminal at Lincolnville. George Mellis had used neither facility within the past twenty-four hours. \"He didn\u0027t come to Dark Harbor,\" the lieutenant told Alexandra. And where the hell did that leave things? Why would the man have dropped out of sight? In the lieutenant\u0027s considered opinion, no man in his right mind would voluntarily leave a woman like Alexandra.\n \"We\u0027ll check the hospitals and mor - \" He caught himself. \"And other places, and I\u0027ll put out an APB on him.\"\n Alexandra was trying to control her emotions, but he could see what an effort it was. \"Thank you, Lieutenant. I don\u0027t have to tell you how much I\u0027ll appreciate anything you can do.\"\n \"That\u0027s my job,\" Lieutenant Ingram replied.\n When Lieutenant Ingram returned to the station, he began calling hospitals and morgues. The responses were negative. There was no accident report on George Mellis. Lieutenant Ingram\u0027s next move was to call a reporter friend on the Maine Courier. After that, the lieutenant sent out a missing person all-points-bulletin.\n The afternoon newspapers carried the story in headlines: HUSBAND OF BLACKWELL HEIRESS MISSING.\n Peter Templeton first heard the news from Detective Nick Pappas.\n \"Peter, remember askin\u0027 me a while ago to do some checkin\u0027 on George Mellis?\"\n \"Yes...\"\n \"He\u0027s done a vanishing act.\"\n \"He\u0027s what?\"\n \"Disappeared, vamoosed, gone.\" He waited while Peter digested the news.\n \"Did he take anything with him? Money, clothes, passport?\"\n \"Nope. According to the report we got from Maine, Mr. Mellis just melted into thin air. You\u0027re his shrink. I thought you might have some idea why our boy would do a thing like that.\"\n Peter said truthfully, \"I haven\u0027t any idea, Nick.\"\n \"If you think of anything, let me know. There\u0027s gonna be a lot of heat on this.\"\n \"Yes,\" Peter promised. \"I will.\"\n Thirty minutes later, Alexandra Mellis telephoned Peter Templeton, and he could hear the shrill edge of panic in her voice. \"I - George is missing. No one seems to know what happened to him. I was hoping he might have told you something that might have given you a clue or - \" She broke off.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Mrs. Mellis. He didn\u0027t. I have no idea what could have happened.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n Peter wished there was some way he could comfort her. \"If I think of anything, I\u0027ll call you back. Where can I reach you?\"\n \"I\u0027m at Dark Harbor now, but I\u0027m going to return to New York this evening. I\u0027ll be at my grandmother\u0027s.\"\n Alexandra could not bear the thought of being alone. She had talked to Kate several times that morning. \"Oh, darling, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing to worry about,\" Kate said. \"He probably went off on some business deal and forgot to tell you.\"\n Neither of them believed it.\n Eve saw the story of George\u0027s disappearance on television. There were photographs of the exterior of Cedar Hill House, and pictures of Alexandra and George after their wedding ceremony. There was a close-up of George, looking upward, with his eyes wide. Somehow it reminded Eve of the look of surprise on his face just before he died.\n The television commentator was saying, \"There has been no evidence of foul play and no ransom demands have been made. The police speculate that George Mellis was possibly the victim of an accident and may be suffering from amnesia.\" Eve smiled in satisfaction.\n They would never find the body. It had been swept out to sea with the tide. Poor George. He had followed her plan perfectly. But she had changed it. She had flown up to Maine and rented a motorboat at Philbrook Cove, to be held for \"a friend.\" She had then rented a second boat from a nearby dock and taken it to Dark Harbor, where she had waited for George. He had been totally unsuspecting. She had been careful to wipe the deck clean before she returned the yacht to the dock. After that, it had been a simple matter to tow George\u0027s rented motorboat back to its pier, return her boat and fly back to New York to await the telephone call she knew Alexandra would make.\n It was a perfect crime. The police would list it as a mysterious disappearance.\n The announcer was saying, \"In other news...\" Eve switched the television set off.\n She did not want to be late for her date with Rory McKenna.\n At six o\u0027clock the following morning, a fishing boat found George Mellis\u0027s body pinned against the breakwater at the mouth of Penebscot Bay. The early news reports called it a drowning and accidental death, but as more information came in, the tenor of the stories began to change. From the coroner\u0027s office came reports that what at first had been thought to have been shark bites were actually stab wounds. The evening newspaper editions screamed: MURDER SUSPECTED IN GEORGE MELLIS MYSTERY DEATH...MILLIONAIRE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH.\n Lieutenant Ingram was studying the tide charts for the previous evening. When he was finished, he leaned back in his chair, a perplexed expression on his face. George Mellis\u0027s body would have been swept out to sea had it not been caught against the breakwater. What puzzled the lieutenant was that the body had to have been carried by the tide from the direction of Dark Harbor. Where George Mellis was not supposed to have been.\n Detective Nick Pappas flew up to Maine to have a talk with Lieutenant Ingram.\n \"I think my department might be of some help to you in this case,\" Nick said. \"We have some interesting background information on George Mellis. I know this is out of our jurisdiction, but if you were to ask for our cooperation, we\u0027d be happy to give it to you, Lieutenant.\"\n In the twenty years Lieutenant Ingram had been with the Waldo County Sheriff\u0027s Department, the only real excitement he had seen was when a drunken tourist shot a moose head off the wall of a local curio shop. The George Mellis murder was front-page news, and Lieutenant Ingram sensed a chance to make a name for himself. With a little luck, it could lead to a job as a detective in the New York City Police Department, where the action was. And so now he looked at Nick Pappas and murmured, \"I don\u0027t know...\"\n As though reading his mind, Nick Pappas said, \"We\u0027re not looking for credit. There\u0027s gonna be a hell of a lot of pressure on this one, and it would make life easier for us if we could wrap it up fast. I could start by filling you in on George Mellis\u0027s background.\"\n Lieutenant Ingram decided he had nothing to lose. \"OK, you\u0027ve got a deal.\"\n Alexandra was in bed, heavily sedated. Her mind stubbornly refused to accept the fact that George had been murdered. How could he have been? There was no reason in the world for anyone to kill him. The police had talked of a knife wound, but they were wrong about that. It had to be some kind of accident. No one would want to kill him... No one would want to kill him... The opiate Dr. Harley gave her finally took hold. She slept.\n Eve had been stunned at the news that George\u0027s body had been found. But perhaps it\u0027s a good thing, Eve thought. Alexandra will be the one under suspicion. She was there, on the island\n Kate was seated next to Eve on the couch in the drawing room. The news had been a tremendous shock to Kate.\n \"Why would anyone want to murder George?\" she asked.\n Eve sighed. \"I don\u0027t know, Gran. I just don\u0027t know. My heart breaks for poor Alex.\"\n Lieutenant Philip Ingram was questioning the attendant on the Lincolnville-Islesboro ferry. \"Are you positive neither Mr. or Mrs. Mellis came over on the ferry Friday afternoon?\"\n \"They didn\u0027t come over on my shift, Phil, and I checked with the morning man, and he didn\u0027t see \u0027em neither. They had to have come in by plane.\"\n \"One more question, Lew. Did any strangers take the ferry across on Friday?\"\n \"Hell,\" the attendant said, \"you know we don\u0027t get no strangers goin\u0027 to the island this time of year. There might be a few tourists in the summer - but in November? She-e-e-it!\"\n Lieutenant Ingram went to talk to the manager of the Isles-boro airport. \"George Mellis sure didn\u0027t fly in that evening, Phil. He musta come over to the island by ferry.\"\n \"Lew said he didn\u0027t see him.\"\n \"Well, hell, he couldn\u0027t a swum over, now could he?\"\n \"What about Mrs. Mellis?\"\n \"Yep. She come in here in her Beechcraft about ten o\u0027clock. I had my son, Charley, run her over to Cedar Hill from the airport.\"\n \"What kind of mood did Mrs. Mellis seem to be in?\"\n \"Funny you should ask. She was as nervous as spit on a hot kettle. Even my boy noticed it. Usually she\u0027s calm, always has a pleasant word for everybody. But that night she was in a tearin\u0027 hurry.\"\n \"One more question. Did any strangers fly in that afternoon or evening? Any unfamiliar faces?\"\n He shook his head. \"Nope. Just the regulars.\"\n An hour later, Lieutenant Ingram was on the phone talking to Nick Pappas. \"What I\u0027ve got so far,\" he told the New York detective, \"is damned confusing. Friday night Mrs. Mellis arrived by private plane at the Islesboro airport around ten o\u0027clock, but her husband wasn\u0027t with her, and he didn\u0027t come in by plane or ferry. In fact, there\u0027s nothin\u0027 to show he was on the island at all that night.\"\n \"Except the tide.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Whoever killed him probably threw him overboard from a boat, figuring the tide would carry him out to sea. Did you check the Corsair?\"\n \"I looked it over. No sign of violence, no bloodstains.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to bring a forensics expert up there. Would you mind?\"\n \"Not as long as you remember our little deal.\"\n \"I\u0027ll remember. See you tomorrow.\"\n Nick Pappas and a team of experts arrived the following morning. Lieutenant Ingram escorted them to the Blackwell dock, where the Corsair was tied up. Two hours later, the forensics expert said, \"Looks like we hit the jackpot, Nick. There are some bloodstains on the underside of the lee rail.\"\n That afternoon, the police laboratory verified that the stains matched George Mellis\u0027s blood type.\n Manhattan\u0027s \"silk stocking\" police precinct was busier than usual. A series of all-night drug busts had filled the prisoners\u0027 cage to capacity, and the holding cells were crowded with prostitutes, drunks and sex offenders. The noise and the stench competed for Peter Templeton\u0027s attention, as he was escorted through the din to Lieutenant Detective Pappas\u0027s office.\n \"Hey, Peter. Nice of you to drop by.\"\n On the phone Pappas had said, \"You\u0027re holdin\u0027 out on me, chum. Be at my office before six o\u0027clock, or I\u0027ll send a fuckin\u0027 SWAT team to bring you in.\"\n When his escort left the office, Peter asked, \"What\u0027s this all about, Nick? What\u0027s bothering you?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s botherin\u0027 me. Someone\u0027s being clever. Do you know what we\u0027ve got? A dead man who vanished from an island he never went to.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\n \"Tell me about it, pal. The ferryboat operator and the guy who runs the airport swear they never saw George Mellis on the night he disappeared. The only other way he could have gotten to Dark Harbor was by motorboat. We checked all the boat operators in the area. Zilch.\"\n \"Perhaps he wasn\u0027t at Dark Harbor that night.\"\n \"The forensic lab says different. They found evidence that Mellis was at the house and changed from a business suit into the sailing clothes he was wearin\u0027 when his body was found.\"\n \"Was he killed at the house?\"\n \"On the Blackwell yacht. His body was dumped overboard. Whoever did it figured the current would carry the body to China.\"\n \"How did - ?\"\n Nick Pappas raised a beefy hand. \"My turn. Mellis was your patient. He must have talked to you about his wife.\"\n \"What does she have to do with this?\"\n \"Everything. She\u0027s my first, second and third choice.\"\n \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\n \"Hey, I thought shrinks never used words like crazy.\"\n \"Nick, what makes you think Alexandra Mellis killed her husband?\"\n \"She was there, and she had a motive. She arrived at the island late that night with some cockamamy excuse about being delayed because she was waitin\u0027 at the wrong airport to meet her sister.\"\n \"What does her sister say?\"\n \"Give me a break. What the hell would you expect her to say? They\u0027re twins. We know George Mellis was at the house that night, but his wife swears she never saw him. It\u0027s a big house, Peter, but it\u0027s not that big. Next, Mrs. M gave all the servants the weekend off. When I asked her why, she said it was George\u0027s idea. George\u0027s lips, of course, are sealed.\"\n Peter sat there, deep in thought. \"You said she had a motive. What?\"\n \"You have a short memory span. You\u0027re the one who put me on the track. The lady was married to a psycho who got his kicks sexually abusing everything he could lay his fists on. He was probably slapping her around pretty good. Let\u0027s say she decided she didn\u0027t want to play anymore. She asked for a divorce. He wouldn\u0027t give it to her. Why should he? He had it made. She wouldn\u0027t dare take him to court - it would touch off too juicy a scandal. She had no choice. She had to kill him.\" He leaned back in his chair.\n \"What do you want from me?\" Peter asked.\n \"Information. You had lunch with Mellis\u0027s wife ten days ago.\" He pressed the button on a tape recorder on the desk. \"We\u0027re going on the record now, Peter. Tell me about that lunch. How did Alexandra Mellis behave? Was she tense? Angry? Hysterical?\"\n \"Nick, I\u0027ve never seen a more relaxed, happily married lady.\"\n Nick Pappas glared at him and snapped off the tape recorder. \"Don\u0027t shaft me, my friend. I went to see Dr. John Harley this morning. He\u0027s been giving Alexandra Mellis medication to stop her from committing suicide, for Christ\u0027s sake!\"\n Dr. John Harley had been greatly disturbed by his meeting with Lieutenant Pappas. The detective had gotten right to the point. \"Has Mrs. Mellis consulted you professionally recently?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Dr. Harley said. \"I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss my patients. I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you.\"\n \"All right, Doc. I understand. You\u0027re old friends. You\u0027d like to keep the whole thing quiet. That\u0027s okay with me.\" He rose to his feet. \"This is a homicide case. I\u0027ll be back in an hour with a warrant for your appointment records. When I find out what I want to know, I\u0027m going to feed it to the newspapers.\"\n Dr. Harley was studying him.\n \"We can handle it that way, or you can tell me now what I want to know, and I\u0027ll do what I can to keep it quiet. Well?\"\n \"Sit down,\" Dr. Harley said. Nick Pappas sat. \"Alexandra has been having some emotional problems lately.\"\n \"What kind of emotional problems?\"\n \"She\u0027s been in a severe depression. She was talking about committing suicide.\"\n \"Did she mention using a knife?\"\n \"No. She said she had a recurrent dream about drowning. I gave her Wellbutrin. She came back and told me it didn\u0027t seem to be helping, and I prescribed Nomifensine. I - I don\u0027t know whether it helped or not.\"\n Nick Pappas sat there, putting things together in his mind. Finally he looked up. \"Anything else?\"\n \"That\u0027s everything, Lieutenant.\"\n But there was more, and John Harley\u0027s conscience was bothering him. He had deliberately refrained from mentioning the brutal attack George Mellis had made on Eve Blackwell. Part of his concern was that he should have reported it to the police at the time it happened, but mainly Dr. Harley wanted to protect the Blackwell family. He had no way of knowing whether there was a connection between the attack on Eve and George Mellis\u0027s murder, but his instincts told him that it was better not to bring up the subject. He intended to do everything possible to protect Kate Blackwell.\n Fifteen minutes after he made that decision, his nurse said, \"Dr. Keith Webster is on line two, Doctor.\"\n It was as if his conscience was prodding him.\n Keith Webster said, \"John, I\u0027d like to stop by this afternoon and see you. Are you free?\"\n \"I\u0027ll make myself free. What time?\"\n \"How\u0027s five o\u0027clock?\"\n \"Fine, Keith. I\u0027ll see you then.\"\n So, the matter was not going to be laid to rest so easily.\n At five o\u0027clock, Dr. Harley ushered Keith Webster into his office. \"Would you like a drink?\"\n \"No, thank you, John. I don\u0027t drink. Forgive me for barging in on you like this.\"\n It seemed to John Harley that every time he saw him, Keith Webster was apologizing about something. He was such a mild, little man, so inoffensive and eager to please - a puppy waiting to be patted on the head. It was incredible to John Harley that within that pale, colorless persona there lurked such a brilliant surgeon.\n \"What can I do for you, Keith?\"\n Keith Webster drew a deep breath. \"It\u0027s about that - you know - that beating George Mellis gave Eve Blackwell.\"\n \"What about it?\"\n \"You\u0027re aware she almost died?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well, it was never reported to the police. In view of what\u0027s happened - Mellis\u0027s murder and everything - I was wondering if maybe I shouldn\u0027t tell the police about it.\"\n So there it was. There seemed no way to escape the problem.\n \"You have to do whatever you think best, Keith.\"\n Keith Webster said gloomily, \"I know. It\u0027s just that I\u0027d hate to do anything that might hurt Eve Blackwell. She\u0027s a very special person.\"\n Dr. Harley was watching him cautiously. \"Yes, she is.\"\n Keith Webster sighed. \"The only thing is, John, if I do keep quiet about it now and the police find out later, it\u0027s going to look bad for me.\"\n For both of us, John Harley thought. He saw a possible out. He said casually, \"It\u0027s not very likely the police would find out, is it? Eve certainly would never mention it, and you fixed her up perfectly. Except for that little scar, you\u0027d never know she\u0027d been disfigured.\"\n Keith Webster blinked. \"What little scar?\"\n \"The red scar on her forehead. She told me you said you were going to remove it in a month or two.\"\n Dr. Webster was blinking faster now. It was some kind of nervous tic, Dr. Harley decided.\n \"I don\u0027t re - When did you last see Eve?\"\n \"She came in about ten days ago to talk about a problem involving her sister. As a matter of fact, the scar was the only way I could tell it was Eve instead of Alexandra. They\u0027re identical twins, you know.\"\n Keith Webster nodded slowly. \"Yes. I\u0027ve seen photographs of Eve\u0027s sister in the newspapers. There\u0027s an amazing likeness. And you say the only way you could tell them apart was by the scar on Eve\u0027s forehead from the operation I performed?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n Dr. Webster sat there, silent, chewing on his lower lip. Finally he said, \"Perhaps I shouldn\u0027t go to the police just yet. I\u0027d like to think about this a little more.\"\n \"Frankly, I think that\u0027s wise, Keith. They\u0027re both lovely young women. The newspapers are hinting that the police think Alexandra killed George. That\u0027s impossible. I remember when they were little girls...\"\n Dr. Webster was no longer listening.\n When he left Dr. Harley, Keith Webster was lost in thought. He had certainly not left even the trace of a scar on that beautiful face. Yet, John Harley had seen it. It was possible that Eve could have gotten a scar afterward in another accident, but then why had she lied? It made no sense.\n He examined it from every angle, going over all the different possibilities, and when he had come to a conclusion, he thought, If I\u0027m right, this is going to change my whole life...\n Early the following morning, Keith Webster called Dr. Harley. \"John,\" he began, \"excuse me for disturbing you. You said that Eve Blackwell came in to talk to you about her sister, Alexandra?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"After Eve\u0027s visit, did Alexandra happen to come in to see you?\"\n \"Yes. As a matter of fact, she came to my office the following day. Why?\"\n \"Just curious. Can you tell me what Eve\u0027s sister came to see you about?\"\n \"Alexandra was in a deep depression. Eve was trying to help her.\"\n Eve had been beaten and almost killed by Alexandra\u0027s husband. And now the man had been murdered and it was Alexandra who was being blamed.\n Keith Webster had always known he was not brilliant. In school he had had to work very hard in order to achieve barely passing grades. He was the perennial butt of his classmates\u0027 jokes. He was neither an athlete nor a scholar, and he was so-cially inept. He was as close as one could come to being a nonentity. No one was more surprised than his own family when Keith Webster was admitted to medical school. When he elected to become a surgeon, neither his peers nor his teachers expected him to become a competent one, let alone a great one. But he had surprised them all. There was a talent deep inside him that was nothing short of genius. He was like some exquisite sculptor working his magic with living flesh instead of clay, and in a short time Keith Webster\u0027s reputation spread. In spite of his success, however, he was never able to overcome the trauma of his childhood. Inside he was still the little boy who bored everyone, the one at whom the girls laughed.\n When he finally reached Eve, Keith\u0027s hands were slippery with sweat. She answered the phone on the first ring. \"Rory?\" Her voice was low and sultry.\n \"No. This is Keith Webster.\"\n \"Oh. Hello.\"\n He heard the change in her voice. \"How\u0027ve you been?\" he asked.\n \"Fine.\"\n He could sense her impatience. \"I - I\u0027d like to see you.\"\n \"I\u0027m not seeing anyone. If you read the papers, you\u0027ll know my brother-in-law was murdered. I\u0027m in mourning.\"\n He wiped his hands on his trousers. \"That\u0027s what I want to see you about, Eve. I have some information you should know about.\"\n \"What kind of information?\"\n \"I would prefer not to discuss it on the telephone.\" He could almost hear Eve\u0027s mind working.\n \"Very well. When?\"\n \"Now, if it\u0027s convenient.\"\n When he arrived at Eve\u0027s apartment thirty minutes later, Eve opened the door for him. \"I\u0027m very busy. What did you want to see me about?\"\n \"About this,\" Keith Webster said apologetically. He opened a manila envelope he was clutching, took out a photograph and diffidently handed it to Eve. It was a photograph of herself.\n She looked at it, puzzled. \"Well?\"\n \"It\u0027s a picture of you.\"\n \"I can see that,\" she said curtly. \"What about it?\"\n \"It was taken after your operation.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"There\u0027s no scar on your forehead, Eve.\"\n He watched the change that came over her face.\n \"Sit down, Keith.\"\n He sat opposite her, on the edge of the couch, and he could not keep from staring at her. He had seen many beautiful women in his practice, but Eve Blackwell totally bewitched him. He had never known anyone like her.\n \"I think you\u0027d better tell me what this is all about.\"\n He started at the beginning. He told her about his visit to Dr. Harley and about the mysterious scar, and as Keith Webster talked, he watched Eve\u0027s eyes. They were expressionless.\n When Keith Webster finished, Eve said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re thinking, but whatever it is, you\u0027re wasting my time. As for the scar, I was playing a little joke on my sister. It\u0027s as simple as that. Now, if you\u0027ve quite finished, I have a great deal to do.\"\n He remained seated. \"I\u0027m sorry to have bothered you. I just thought I should talk to you before I went to the police.\" He could see that he really had her attention now.\n \"Why on earth would you go to the police?\"\n \"I\u0027m obliged to report the attack George Mellis made on you. Then there\u0027s that business about you and the scar. I don\u0027t understand it, but I\u0027m sure you can explain it to them.\"\n Eve felt the first stab of fear. This stupid, dreary little man in front of her had no idea what had really happened, but he knew enough to start the police asking questions.\n George Mellis had been a frequent visitor to the apartment. The police could probably find witnesses who had seen him. She had lied about being in Washington the night of George\u0027s murder. She had no real alibi. She had never thought she would need one. If the police learned that George had almost killed her, it would give them a motive. The whole scheme would begin to unravel. She had to silence this man.\n \"What is it you want? Money?\"\n \"No!\"\n She saw the indignation on his face. \"What, then?\"\n Dr. Webster looked down at the rug, his face red with embarrassment. \"I - I like you so much, Eve. I would hate it if anything bad happened to you.\"\n She forced a smile. \"Nothing bad is going to happen to me, Keith. I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. Believe me, none of this has anything to do with George Mellis\u0027s murder.\" She reached out and took his hand. \"I would really appreciate it very much if you would forget about this. All right?\"\n He covered her hand and squeezed it. \"I\u0027d like to, Eve. I really would. But they\u0027re holding the coroner\u0027s inquest Saturday. I\u0027m a doctor. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s my duty to testify at that inquest and tell them everything I know.\"\n He saw the alarm that appeared in her eyes.\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that!\"\n He stroked her hand. \"Yes, I do, Eve. It\u0027s my sworn obligation. There\u0027s only one thing that could prevent me from doing it.\" He watched her leap to the bait of his words.\n \"What is that?\"\n His voice was very gentle. \"A husband can\u0027t be forced to testify against his wife.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-35.html","bookId":2358,"book":{"id":2358,"title":"Master of the Game","description":"Storyline: \n WHO IS KATE BLACKWELL? \n She is the symbol of success, the beautiful woman who parlayed her inheritance into an international conglomerate.
