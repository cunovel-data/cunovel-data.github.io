{"id":68005,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"The dizzy spells were getting worse, and things were beginning to blur in Kate\u0027s mind. She would sit at her desk considering a proposed merger and suddenly realize the merger had taken place ten years earlier. It frightened her. She finally decided to take Brad Rogers\u0027s advice to see John Harley.\\n\\n It had been a long time since Dr. Harley had been able to persuade Kate Blackwell to have a checkup, and he took full advantage of her visit. He examined her thoroughly, and when he finished he asked her to wait for him in his office. John Harley was disturbed. Kate Blackwell was remarkably alert for her age, but there were disquieting signs. There was a definite hardening of the arteries, which would account for her occasional dizziness and weakened memory. She should have retired years ago, and yet she hung on tenaciously, unwilling to give the reins to anyone else. Who am I to talk? he thought. I should have retired ages ago.\\n\\n Now, with the results of the examination in front of him, John Harley said, \"I wish I were in your condition, Kate.\"\\n\\n \"Cut the soft-soap, John. What\u0027s my problem?\"\\n\\n \"Age, mostly. There\u0027s a little hardening of the arteries, and - \"\\n\\n \"Arteriosclerosis?\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Is that the medical term for it?\" Dr. Harley asked. \"Whatever it is, you\u0027ve got it.\"\\n\\n \"How bad is it?\"\\n\\n \"For your age, I\u0027d say it was pretty normal. These things are all relative.\"\\n\\n \"Can you give me something to stop these bloody dizzy spells? I hate fainting in front of a roomful of men. It looks bad for my sex.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I don\u0027t think that will be any problem. When are you going to retire, Kate?\"\\n\\n \"When I have a great-grandson to take over the business.\"\\n\\n The two old friends who had known each other for so many years sized each other up across the desk. John Harley had not always agreed with Kate, but he had always admired her courage.\\n\\n As though reading his mind, Kate sighed, \"Do you know one of the great disappointments of my life, John? Eve. I really cared for that child. I wanted to give her the world, but she never gave a damn about anyone but herself.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong, Kate. Eve cares a great deal about you.\"\\n\\n \"Like bloody hell she does.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in a position to know. Recently she\" - he had to choose his words carefully - \"suffered a terrible accident. She almost died.\"\\n\\n Kate felt her heart lurch. \"Why - why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\\n\\n \"She wouldn\u0027t let me. She was so concerned you would be worried that she made me swear not to say a word.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, my God.\" It was an agonized whisper. \"Is - is she all right?\" Kate\u0027s voice was hoarse.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s fine now.\"\\n\\n Kate sat, staring into space. \"Thank you for telling me, John. Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll write out a prescription for those pills.\" When he finished writing the prescription, he looked up. Kate Blackwell had left.\\n\\n Eve opened the door and stared unbelievingly. Her grandmother was standing there, stiff and straight as always, allowing no sign of frailty to show.\\n\\n \"May I come in?\" Kate asked.\\n\\n Eve stepped aside, unable to take in what was happening. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n Kate walked in and looked around the small apartment, but she made no comment. \"May I sit down?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. Please do. Forgive me - this is so - Can I get you something? Tea, coffee, anything?\"\\n\\n \"No, thank you. Are you well, Eve?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, thank you. I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"I just came from Dr. John. He told me you had been in a terrible accident.\"\\n\\n Eve watched her grandmother cautiously, not sure what was coming. \"Yes...\"\\n\\n \"He said you were...near death. And that you would not allow him to tell me because you didn\u0027t want to worry me.\"\\n\\n So that was it. Eve was on surer ground now. \"Yes, Gran.\"\\n\\n \"That would indicate to me,\" Kate\u0027s voice was suddenly choked, \"that - that you cared.\"\\n\\n Eve started to cry from relief. \"Of course I care. I\u0027ve always cared.\"\\n\\n And an instant later, Eve was in her grandmother\u0027s arms. Kate held Eve very close and pressed her lips to the blond head in her lap. Then she whispered, \"I\u0027ve been such a damned old fool. Can you ever forgive me?\" Kate pulled out a linen handkerchief and blew her nose. \"I was too hard on you,\" she declared. \"I couldn\u0027t bear it if anything had happened to you.\"\\n\\n Eve stroked her grandmother\u0027s blue-veined hand soothingly and said, \"I\u0027m all right, Gran. Everything\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n Kate was on her feet, blinking back tears. \"We\u0027ll have a fresh start, all right?\" She pulled Eve up to face her. \"I\u0027ve been stubborn and unbending, like my father. I\u0027m going to make amends for that. The first thing I\u0027m going to do is put you back in my will, where you belong.\"\\n\\n What was happening was too good to be true! \"I - I don\u0027t care about the money. I only care about you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re my heiress - you and Alexandra. You two are all the family I have.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting along fine,\" Eve said, \"but if it will make you happy - \"\\n\\n \"It will make me very happy, darling. Very happy, indeed. When can you move back into the house?\"\\n\\n Eve hesitated for only a moment. \"I think it would be better if I stayed here, but I\u0027ll see you as often as you want to see me. Oh, Gran, you don\u0027t know how lonely I\u0027ve been.\"\\n\\n Kate took her granddaughter\u0027s hand and said, \"Can you forgive me?\"\\n\\n Eve looked her in the eye and said solemnly, \"Of course, I can forgive you.\"\\n\\n The moment Kate left, Eve mixed herself a stiff Scotch and water and sank down onto the couch to relive the incredible scene that had just occurred. She could have shouted aloud with joy. She and Alexandra were now the sole heirs to the Blackwell fortune. It would be easy enough to get rid of Alexandra. It was George Mellis Eve was concerned about. He had suddenly become a hindrance.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s been a change of plans,\" Eve told George. \"Kate has put me back in her will.\"\\n\\n George paused in the middle of lighting a cigarette. \"Really? Congratulations.\"\\n\\n \"If anything happened to Alexandra now, it would look suspicious. So we\u0027ll take care of her later when - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid later doesn\u0027t suit me.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not stupid, darling. If anything happens to Alexandra, I\u0027ll inherit her stock. You want me out of the picture, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Eve shrugged. \"Let\u0027s say you\u0027re an unnecessary complication. I\u0027m willing to make a deal with you. Get a divorce, and as soon as I come into the money, I\u0027ll give you - \"\\n\\n He laughed. \"You\u0027re funny. It\u0027s no good, baby. Nothing has changed. Alex and I have a date in Dark Harbor Friday night. I intend to keep it.\"\\n\\n Alexandra was overjoyed when she heard the news about Eve and her grandmother. \"Now we\u0027re a family again,\" she said.\\n\\n The telephone.\\n\\n \"Hello. I hope I\u0027m not disturbing you, Eve. It\u0027s Keith Webster.\"\\n\\n He had started telephoning her two or three times a week. At first his clumsy ardor had amused Eve, but lately he had become a nuisance.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t talk to you now,\" Eve said. \"I was just going out the door.\\n\\n \"Oh.\" His voice was apologetic. \"Then I won\u0027t keep you. I have two tickets for the horse show next week. I know you love horses, and I thought - \"\\n\\n \"Sorry. I will probably be out of town next week.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\" She could hear the disappointment in his voice. \"Perhaps the following week, then. I\u0027ll get tickets to a play. What would you like to see?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen them all,\" Eve said curtly. \"I have to run.\" She replaced the receiver. It was time to get dressed. She was meeting Rory McKenna, a young actor she had seen in an off-Broadway play. He was five years younger than she, and he was like an insatiable wild stallion. Eve visualized his making love to her, and she felt a moisture between her legs. She looked forward to an exciting evening.\\n\\n On his way home, George Mellis stopped to buy flowers for Alexandra. He was in an exuberant mood. It was a delicious irony that the old lady had put Eve back in her will, but it changed nothing. After Alexandra\u0027s accident, he would take care of Eve. The arrangements were all made. On Friday Alexandra would be waiting for him at Dark Harbor. \"Just the two of us,\" he had pleaded as he kissed her. \"Get rid of all the servants, darling.\"\\n\\n Peter Templeton was unable to get Alexandra Mellis out of his mind. He heard the echo of George Mellis\u0027s words: I may take her away somewhere. I think she needs a change. Every instinct told Peter that Alexandra was in danger, yet he was powerless to act. He could not go to Nick Pappas with his suspicions. He had no proof.\\n\\n Across town, in the executive offices of Kruger-Brent, Ltd., Kate Blackwell was signing a new will, leaving the bulk of her estate to her two granddaughters.\\n\\n In upstate New York, Tony Blackwell was standing before his easel in the garden of the sanitarium. The painting on the easel was a jumble of colors, the kind of painting an untalented child might do. Tony stepped back to look at it and smiled with pleasure.\\n\\n Friday. 10:57 A.M.\\n\\n At La Guardia Airport, a taxi pulled up in front of the Eastern Airlines shuttle terminal and Eve Blackwell got out. She handed the driver a hundred-dollar bill.\\n\\n \"Hey, I can\u0027t change this, lady,\" he said. \"Have you got anything smaller?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll have to get change inside.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t time. I have to catch the next shuttle to Washington.\" She looked at the Baume \u0026 Mercier watch on her wrist and made a decision. \"Keep the hundred dollars,\" she told the startled driver.\\n\\n Eve hurried into the terminal. She half-walked and half-ran to the departure gate marked Washington Shuttle. \"One round trip to Washington,\" Eve said breathlessly.\\n\\n The man looked at the clock above his head. \"You missed this one by two minutes. It\u0027s just taking off.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to be on that plane. I\u0027m meeting - Isn\u0027t there anything you can do?\" She was near panic.\\n\\n \"Take it easy, miss. There\u0027s another shuttle leaving in an hour.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too - Damn it!\"\\n\\n He watched her regain control of herself.\\n\\n \"Very well. I\u0027ll wait. Is there a coffee shop around here?\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am. But there\u0027s a coffee machine down the corridor.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n He looked after her and thought, What a beauty. I sure envy the guy she\u0027s in such a hurry to meet.\\n\\n Friday. 2:00 P.M.\\n\\n It will be a second honeymoon, Alexandra thought. The idea excited her. Get rid of all the servants. I want it to be just the two of us, angel. We\u0027ll have a lovely weekend. And now Alexandra was leaving the brownstone, on her way to Dark Harbor to meet George. She was running behind schedule. She had had a luncheon engagement, and it had taken longer than Alexandra had planned. She said to the maid, \"I\u0027m going now. I\u0027ll be back Monday morning.\"\\n\\n As Alexandra reached the front door, the telephone rang. I\u0027m late. Let it ring, she thought, and hurried out the door.\\n\\n Friday. 7:00 P.M.\\n\\n George Mellis had examined Eve\u0027s plan over and over. There was not a single flaw in it. There will be a motor launch waiting for you at Philbrook Cove. Take it to Dark Harbor and make sure you\u0027re not seen. Tie it to the stern of the Corsair. You\u0027ll take Alexandra for a moonlight sail. When you\u0027re out at sea, do whatever turns you on, George - just don\u0027t leave any traces of blood. Dump the body overboard, get into the launch and leave the Corsair adrift. You\u0027ll take the launch back to Philbrook Cove, then catch the Lincolnville ferry to Dark Harbor. Take a taxi to the house. Use some excuse to get the driver to go in so that you\u0027ll both notice the Corsair is missing from the dock. When you see that Alexandra is gone, you\u0027ll call the police. They\u0027ll never find Alexandra\u0027s body. The tide will wash it out to sea. Two eminent doctors will testify it was a probable suicide.\\n\\n He found the motorboat moored at Philbrook Cove, waiting for him, according to plan.\\n\\n George crossed the bay without running lights, using the light of the moon to steer by. He passed a number of moored boats without being detected, and arrived at the dock at the Blackwell estate. He cut the motor and made the line fast to the Corsair, the large motor sailer.\\n\\n She was talking on the telephone, waiting for him in the living room when George walked in. She waved to him, covered the receiver with her hand and mouthed, \"It\u0027s Eve.\" She listened a moment, then, \"I have to go now, Eve. My darling just arrived. I\u0027ll see you at lunch next week.\" She replaced the receiver and hurried over to hug George. \"You\u0027re early. I\u0027m so pleased.\"\\n\\n \"I got lonely for you, so I just dropped everything and came.\"\\n\\n She kissed him. \"I love you.\"\\n\\n \"I love you, matia mou. Did you get rid of the servants?\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"It\u0027s just the two of us. Guess what? I made moussaka for you.\"\\n\\n He traced a finger lightly across the nipples straining against her silk blouse. \"Do you know what I\u0027ve been thinking about all afternoon at that dreary office? Going for a sail with you. There\u0027s a brisk wind. Why don\u0027t we go out for an hour or two?\"\\n\\n \"If you like. But my moussaka is - \"\\n\\n He cupped his hand over her breast. \"Dinner can wait. I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"All right. I\u0027ll go change. It won\u0027t take me a minute.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll race you.\"\\n\\n He went upstairs to his clothes closet, changed into a pair of slacks, a sweater and boat shoes. Now that the moment was here, he was filled with a sense of wild anticipation, a feeling of excitement that was almost an explosion.\\n\\n He heard her voice. \"I\u0027m ready, darling.\"\\n\\n He turned. She stood in the doorway, dressed in a sweater, a pair of black slacks and canvas shoes. Her long, blond hair was tied back with a little blue ribbon. My God, she\u0027s beautiful! he thought. It seemed almost a shame to waste that beauty.\\n\\n \"So am I,\" George told her.\\n\\n She noticed the motor launch secured to the stern of the yacht. \"What\u0027s that for, darling?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a little island at the end of the bay that I\u0027ve always wanted to explore,\" George explained. \"We\u0027ll take the launch over to it so we won\u0027t have to worry about rocks.\"\\n\\n He cast off the lines and powered slowly out of the slip. He nosed into the wind to raise the mainsail and jib, and the boat fell off on a starboard tack. The wind caught the large sails and the Corsair surged forward. George headed out to sea. As they cleared the breakwater, they were met with a stiff force-five wind, and the boat started heeling, its lee rail running under.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s wild and lovely,\" she called out. \"I\u0027m so happy, darling.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"So am I.\"\\n\\n In an odd way, it gave George Mellis pleasure that Alexandra was happy, that she was going to die happy. He scanned the horizon to make certain no other boats were close by. There were only faint lights from afar. It was time.\\n\\n He put the boat on automatic pilot, took one last look around the empty horizon and walked over to the lee railing, his heart beginning to pound with excitement.\\n\\n \"Alex,\" he called. \"Come look at this.\"\\n\\n She made her way over to him and looked down at the cold, dark water racing below them.\\n\\n \"Come to me.\" His voice was a harsh command.\\n\\n She moved into his arms, and he kissed her hard on the lips. His arms closed around her, hugging her, and he felt her body relax. He flexed his muscles and began to lift her in the air toward the railing.\\n\\n She was fighting him suddenly. \"George!\"\\n\\n He lifted her higher, and he felt her try to pull away, but he was too strong for her. She was almost on top of the railing now, her feet kicking wildly, and he braced himself to shove her over the side. At that instant, he felt a sudden white-hot pain in his chest. His first thought was, I\u0027m having a heart attack. He opened his mouth to speak and blood came spurting out. He dropped his arms and looked down at his chest in disbelief. Blood was pouring from a gaping wound in it. He looked up, and she was standing there with a bloody knife in her hand, smiling at him.\\n\\n George Mellis\u0027s last thought was, Eve... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-34.html","bookId":2358,"book":{"id":2358,"title":"Master of the Game","description":"Storyline: WHO IS KATE BLACKWELL? \\n She is the symbol of success, the beautiful woman who parlayed her inheritance into an international conglomerate.
