{"id":68000,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"From the time she was a little girl, Eve Blackwell had been aware of her ability to manipulate people. Before, it had always been a game with her, but now it was deadly serious. She had been treated shabbily, deprived of a vast fortune that was rightfully hers, by her scheming sister and her vindictive old grandmother. They were going to pay in full for what they had done to her, and the thought of it gave Eve such intense pleasure that it almost brought her to orgasm. Their lives were now in her hands.\n Eve worked out her plan carefully and meticulously, orchestrating every move. In the beginning, George Mellis had been a reluctant conspirator.\n \"Christ, it\u0027s too dangerous. I don\u0027t need to get involved in anything like this,\" he argued. \"I can get all the money I need.\"\n \"How?\" Eve asked contemptuously. \"By laying a lot of fat women with blue hair? Is that how you want to spend the rest of your life? What happens when you put on a little weight and start to get a few wrinkles around your eyes? No, George, you\u0027ll never have another opportunity like this. If you listen to me, you and I can own one of the largest conglomerates in the world. You hear me? Own it.\"\n \"How do you know this plan will work?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m the greatest living expert on my grandmother and my sister. Believe me, it will work.\"\n Eve sounded confident, but she had reservations and they concerned George Mellis. Eve knew she could do her part, but she was not sure George would be able to do his. He was unstable, and there was no room for error. One mistake, and the whole plan would fall apart.\n She said to him now, \"Make up your mind. Are you in or out?\"\n He studied her for a long time. \"I\u0027m in.\" He moved close to her and stroked her shoulders. His voice was husky. \"I want to be all the way in.\"\n Eve felt a sexual thrill go through her. \"All right,\" she whispered, \"but we do it my way.\"\n They were in bed. Naked, he was the most magnificent animal Eve had ever seen. And the most dangerous, but that only added to her excitement. She had the weapon now to control him. She nibbled at his body, slowly moving down toward his groin, tiny, teasing bites that made his penis grow stiff and hard.\n \"Fuck me, George,\" Eve said.\n \"Turn over.\"\n \"No. My way.\"\n \"I don\u0027t enjoy that.\"\n \"I know. You\u0027d like me to be a tight-assed little boy, wouldn\u0027t you, darling? I\u0027m not. I\u0027m a woman. Get on top of me.\"\n He mounted her and put his tumescent penis inside her. \"I can\u0027t be satisfied this way, Eve.\"\n She laughed. \"I don\u0027t care, sweetheart. I can.\"\n She began to move her hips, thrusting against him, feeling him going deeper and deeper inside her. She had orgasm after orgasm, and watched his frustration grow. He wanted to hurt her, to make her scream with pain, but he dared not.\n \"Again!\" Eve commanded. And he pounded his body into her until she moaned aloud with pleasure. \"Ahh-h-h...that\u0027s enough for now.\"\n He withdrew and lay at her side. He reached for her breasts. \"Now it\u0027s my - \"\n And she said curtly, \"Get dressed.\"\n He rose from the bed, trembling with frustration and rage. Eve lay in bed watching him put on his clothes, a tight smile on her face. \"You\u0027ve been a good boy, George. It\u0027s time you got your reward. I\u0027m going to turn Alexandra over to you.\"\n Overnight, everything had changed for Alexandra. What was to have been her last day at Berkley and Mathews had turned into a triumph for her. She had gone from outcast to heroine. News of her caper spread all over Madison Avenue.\n \"You\u0027re a legend in your own time,\" Vince Barnes grinned.\n Now she was one of them.\n Alexandra enjoyed her work, particularly the creative sessions that went on every morning. She knew this was not what she wanted to do for the rest of her life, but she was not sure what she wanted. She had had at least a dozen proposals of marriage, and she had been tempted by one or two of them, but something had been lacking. She simply had not found the right man.\n On Friday morning, Eve telephoned to invite Alexandra to lunch. \"There\u0027s a new French restaurant that just opened. I hear the food is marvelous.\"\n Alexandra was delighted to hear from her sister. She was concerned about Eve. Alexandra telephoned her two or three times a week, but Eve was either out or too busy to see her. So now, even though Alexandra had an engagement, she said, \"I\u0027d love to have lunch with you.\"\n The restaurant was chic and expensive, and the bar was filled with patrons waiting for tables. Eve had had to use her grandmother\u0027s name in order to get a reservation. It galled her, and she thought, Just wait. One day you\u0027ll be begging me to eat at your crummy restaurant. Eve was already seated when Alexandra arrived. She watched Alexandra as the maitre d\u0027 escorted her to the table, and she had the odd sensation she was watching herself approach the table.\n Eve greeted her sister with a kiss on the cheek. \"You look absolutely marvelous, Alex. Work must agree with you.\"\n They ordered, and then caught up with each other\u0027s lives.\n \"How\u0027s the job going?\" Eve asked.\n Alexandra told Eve everything that was happening to her, and Eve gave Alexandra a carefully edited version of her own life. In the midst of their conversation, Eve glanced up. George Mellis was standing there. He was looking at the two of them, momentarily confused. My God, Eve realized, he doesn\u0027t know which one I am!\n \"George!\" she said.\n He turned to her in relief. \"Eve!\"\n Eve said, \"What a pleasant surprise.\" She nodded toward Alexandra. \"I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve met my sister. Alex, may I present George Mellis.\"\n George took Alexandra\u0027s hand and said, \"Enchanted.\" Eve had mentioned that her sister was a twin, but it had not occurred to him that they would be identical twins.\n Alexandra was staring at George, fascinated.\n Eve said, \"Won\u0027t you join us?\"\n \"I wish I could. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m late for an appointment. Another time, perhaps.\" He looked at Alexandra. \"And soon, I hope.\"\n They watched him leave. \"Good heavens!\" Alexandra said. \"Who was that?\"\n \"Oh, he\u0027s a friend of Nita Ludwig. I met him at her house party.\"\n \"Am I crazy, or is he as stunning as I think he is?\"\n Eve laughed. \"He\u0027s not my type, but women seem to find him attractive.\"\n \"I would think so! Is he married?\"\n \"No. But it\u0027s not because they aren\u0027t out there trying, darling. George is very rich. You might say he has everything: looks, money, social background.\" And Eve skillfully changed the subject.\n When Eve asked for the check, the captain told her it had been taken care of by Mr. Mellis.\n Alexandra was unable to stop thinking about George Mellis.\n On Monday afternoon, Eve called Alexandra and said, \"Well, it looks like you made a hit, darling. George Mellis called me and asked for your telephone number. Is it all right to give it to him?\"\n Alexandra was surprised to find that she was smiling. \"If you\u0027re sure you\u0027re not interested in - \"\n \"I told you, Alex, he\u0027s not my type.\"\n \"Then I don\u0027t mind if you give him my number.\"\n They chatted a few minutes more, and Eve hung up. She replaced the receiver and looked up at George, who was lying next to her on the bed, naked. \"The lady said yes.\"\n \"How soon?\"\n \"When I tell you.\"\n Alexandra tried to forget that George Mellis was going to telephone her, but the more she tried to put him out of her mind, the more she thought about him. She had never been particularly attracted to handsome men, for she had found that most of them were self-centered. But George Mellis, Alexandra thought, seemed different. There was an overpowering quality about him. The mere touch of his hand had stirred her. You\u0027re crazy, she told herself. You\u0027ve only seen the man for two minutes.\n He did not call all that week, and Alexandra\u0027s emotions went from impatience to frustration to anger. To hell with him, she thought. He\u0027s found someone else. Good!\n When the phone rang at the end of the following week and Alexandra heard his deep, husky voice, her anger dissipated as if by magic.\n \"This is George Mellis,\" he said. \"We met briefly when you and your sister were having lunch. Eve said you wouldn\u0027t mind if I telephoned you.\"\n \"She did mention that you might call,\" Alexandra said casually. \"By the way, thank you for the lunch.\"\n \"You deserve a feast. You deserve a monument.\"\n Alexandra laughed, enjoying his extravagance.\n \"I wonder if you would care to have dinner with me one evening?\"\n \"Why - I - yes. That would be nice.\"\n \"Wonderful. If you had said no, I should have killed myself.\"\n \"Please don\u0027t,\" Alexandra said. \"I hate eating alone.\"\n \"So do I. I know a little restaurant on Mulberry Street: Matoon\u0027s. It\u0027s very obscure, but the food is - \"\n \"Matoon\u0027s! I love it!\" Alexandra exclaimed. \"It\u0027s my favorite.\"\n \"You know it?\" There was surprise in his voice.\n \"Oh, yes.\"\n George looked over at Eve and grinned. He had to admire her ingenuity. She had briefed him on all of Alexandra\u0027s likes and dislikes. George Mellis knew everything there was to know about Eve\u0027s sister.\n When George finally replaced the receiver, Eve thought, It\u0027s started.\n It was the most enchanting evening of Alexandra\u0027s life. One hour before George Mellis was due, a dozen pink balloons arrived, with an orchid attached. Alexandra had been filled with a fear that her imagination might have led her to expect too much, but the moment she saw George Mellis again, all her doubts were swept away. She felt once again his overpowering magnetism.\n They had a drink at the house and then went on to the restaurant.\n \"Would you like to look at the menu?\" George asked. \"Or shall I order for you?\"\n Alexandra had her favorite dishes here, but she wanted to please George. \"Why don\u0027t you order?\"\n He chose every one of Alexandra\u0027s favorites, and she had the heady feeling he was reading her mind. They dined on stuffed artichokes, veal Matoon, a specialty of the house, and angel hair, a delicate pasta. They had a salad that George mixed at the table with a deft skill.\n \"Do you cook?\" Alexandra asked.\n \"Ah, it\u0027s one of the passions of my life. My mother taught me. She was a brilliant cook.\"\n \"Are you close to your family, George?\"\n He smiled, and Alexandra thought it was the most attractive smile she had ever seen.\n \"I\u0027m Greek,\" he said simply. \"I\u0027m the oldest of three brothers and two sisters, and we are like one.\" A look of sadness came into his eyes. \"Leaving them was the most difficult thing I ever had to do. My father and my brothers begged me to stay. We have a large business, and they felt I was needed there.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you stay?\"\n \"I will probably seem a fool to you, but I prefer to make my own way. It has always been difficult for me to accept gifts from anyone, and the business was a gift handed down from my grandfather to my father. No, I will take nothing from my father. Let my brothers have my share.\"\n How Alexandra admired him.\n \"Besides,\" George added softly, \"if I had stayed in Greece, I never would have met you.\"\n Alexandra felt herself blushing. \"You\u0027ve never been married?\"\n \"No. I used to get engaged once a day,\" he teased, \"but at the last moment I always felt there was something wrong.\" He leaned forward, and his voice was earnest. \"Beautiful Alexandra, you are going to think me very old-fashioned, but when I get married, it will be forever. One woman is enough for me, but it must be the right woman.\"\n \"I think that\u0027s lovely,\" she murmured.\n \"And you?\" George Mellis asked. \"Have you ever been in love?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"How unlucky for someone,\" he said. \"But how lucky for - \"\n At that moment, the waiter appeared with dessert. Alexandra was dying to ask George to finish the sentence, but she was afraid to.\n Alexandra had never felt so completely at ease with anyone. George Mellis seemed so genuinely interested in her that she found herself telling him about her childhood, her life, the experiences she had stored up and treasured.\n George Mellis prided himself on being an expert on women. He knew that beautiful women were usually the most insecure, for men concentrated on that beauty, leaving the women feeling like objects rather than human beings. When George was with a beautiful woman, he never mentioned her looks. He made the woman feel that he was interested in her mind, her feelings, that he was a soul mate sharing her dreams. It was an extraordinary experience for Alexandra. She told George about Kate, and about Eve.\n \"Your sister does not live with you and your grandmother?\"\n \"No. She - Eve wanted an apartment of her own.\"\n Alexandra could not imagine why George Mellis had not been attracted to her sister. Whatever the reason, Alexandra was grateful. During the course of the dinner, Alexandra noted that every woman in the place was aware of George, but not once did he look around or take his eyes from her.\n Over coffee, George said, \"I don\u0027t know if you like jazz, but there\u0027s a club on St. Marks Place called the Five Spot...\"\n \"Where Cecil Taylor plays!\"\n He looked at Alexandra in astonishment. \"You\u0027ve been there?\"\n \"Often!\" Alexandra laughed. \"I love him! It\u0027s incredible how we share the same tastes.\"\n George replied quietly, \"It\u0027s like some kind of miracle.\"\n They listened to Cecil Taylor\u0027s spellbinding piano playing, long solos that rocked the room with arpeggios and rippling glissandi. From there they went to a bar on Bleecker Street, where the customers drank, ate popcorn, threw darts and listened to good piano music. Alexandra watched as George got into a dart contest with one of the regular patrons. The man was good, but he never had a chance. George played with a grim intensity that was almost frightening. It was only a game, but he played it as though it meant life or death. He\u0027s a man who has to win, Alexandra thought.\n It was 2:00 A.M. when they left the bar, and Alexandra hated for the evening to end.\n George sat beside Alexandra in the chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce he had rented. He did not speak. He just looked at her. The resemblance between the two sisters was startling. I wonder if their bodies are alike. He visualized Alexandra in bed with him, writhing and screaming with pain.\n \"What are you thinking?\" Alexandra asked.\n He looked away from her so she could not read his eyes. \"You\u0027ll laugh at me.\"\n \"I won\u0027t. I promise.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t blame you if you did. I suppose I\u0027m considered something of a playboy. You know the life - yachting trips and parties, and all the rest of it.\"\n \"Yes...\"\n He fixed his dark eyes on Alexandra. \"I think you are the one woman who could change all that. Forever.\"\n Alexandra felt her pulse quicken. \"I - I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\n \"Please. Don\u0027t say anything.\" His lips were very close to hers, and Alexandra was ready. But he made no move. Don\u0027t make any advances, Eve had warned. Not on the first night. If you do, you become one of a long line of Romeos dying to get their hands on her and her fortune. She has to make the first move.\n And so, George Mellis merely held Alexandra\u0027s hand in his until the car glided to a smooth stop in front of the Blackwell mansion. George escorted Alexandra to her front door. She turned to him and said, \"I can\u0027t tell you how much I\u0027ve enjoyed this evening.\"\n \"It was magic for me.\"\n Alexandra\u0027s smile was bright enough to light up the street. \"Good night, George,\" she whispered. And she disappeared inside.\n Fifteen minutes later, Alexandra\u0027s phone rang. \"Do you know what I just did? I telephoned my family. I told them about the wonderful woman I was with tonight. Sleep well, lovely Alexandra.\"\n When he hung up, George Mellis thought, After we\u0027re married, I will call my family. And I\u0027ll tell them all to go fuck themselves. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-29.html","bookId":2358,"book":{"id":2358,"title":"Master of the Game","description":"Storyline: \n WHO IS KATE BLACKWELL? \n She is the symbol of success, the beautiful woman who parlayed her inheritance into an international conglomerate.
