Kate had psychiatrists flown in from Paris, Vienna and Berlin, but when all the examinations and tests had been completed, the diagnosis was the same: Her son was a homicidal schizophrenic and paranoiac.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t respond to drugs or psychiatric treatment, and he\u0027s violent. We have to keep him under restraint.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of restraint?\" Kate asked.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in a padded cell. Most of the time we have to keep him in a straitjacket.\"\\n\\n \"Is that necessary?\"\\n\\n \"Without it, Mrs. Blackwell, he would kill anyone who got near him.\"\\n\\n She closed her eyes in pain. This was not her sweet, gentle Tony they were talking about. It was a stranger, someone possessed. She opened her eyes. \"Is there nothing that can be done?\"\\n\\n \"Not if we can\u0027t reach his mind. We\u0027re keeping him on drugs, but the moment they wear off, he gets manic again. We can\u0027t continue this treatment indefinitely.\"\\n\\n Kate stood very straight. \"What do you suggest, Doctor?\"\\n\\n \"In similar cases, we\u0027ve found that removing a small portion of the brain has produced remarkable results.\"\\n\\n Kate swallowed. \"A lobotomy?\"\\n\\n \"That is correct. Your son will still be able to function in every way, except that he will no longer have any strong dysfunctional emotions.\"\\n\\n Kate sat there, her mind and body chilled. Dr. Morris, a young doctor from the Menninger Clinic, broke the silence. \"I know how difficult this must be for you, Mrs. Blackwell. If you\u0027d like to think about - \"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the only thing that will stop his torment,\" Kate said, \"do it.\"\\n\\n Frederick Hoffman wanted his granddaughters. \"I will take them back to Germany with me.\"\\n\\n It seemed to Kate that he had aged twenty years since Marianne\u0027s death. Kate felt sorry for him, but she had no intention of giving up Tony\u0027s children. \"They need a woman\u0027s care, Frederick. Marianne would have wanted them brought up here. You\u0027ll come and visit them often.\"\\n\\n And he was finally persuaded.\\n\\n The twins were moved into Kate\u0027s home, and a nursery suite was set up for them. Kate interviewed governesses, and finally hired a young French woman named Solange Dunas.\\n\\n Kate named the first-born Eve, and her twin, Alexandra. They were identical - impossible to tell apart. Seeing them together was like looking at an image in a mirror, and Kate marveled at the double miracle that her son and Marianne had created. They were both bright babies, quick and responsive, but even after a few weeks, Eve seemed more mature than Alexandra. Eve was the first to crawl and talk and walk. Alexandra followed quickly, but from the beginning it was Eve who was the leader. Alexandra adored her sister and tried to imitate everything she did. Kate spent as much time with her granddaughters as possible. They made her feel young. And Kate began to dream again. One day, when I\u0027m old and ready to retire...\\n\\n On the twins\u0027 first birthday, Kate gave them a party. They each had an identical birthday cake, and there were dozens of presents from friends, company employees and the household staff. Their second birthday party seemed to follow almost immediately. Kate could not believe how rapidly the time went by and how quickly the twins were growing. She was able to discern even more clearly the differences in their personalities: Eve, the stronger, was more daring, Alexandra was softer, content to follow her sister\u0027s lead. With no mother or father, Kate thought repeatedly, it\u0027s a blessing that they have each other and love each other so much.\\n\\n The night before their fifth birthday, Eve tried to murder Alexandra.\\n\\n It is written in Genesis 25: 22-23:\\n\\n And the children struggled together within her...\\n\\n And the Lord said unto her, Two [nations] are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one [people] shall be stronger than the other [people]; and the elder shall serve the younger.\\n\\n In the case of Eve and Alexandra, Eve had no intention of serving her younger sister.\\n\\n Eve had hated her sister for as long as she could remember. She went into a silent rage when someone picked up Alexandra, or petted her or gave her a present. Eve felt she was being cheated. She wanted it all for herself - all the love and the beautiful things that surrounded the two of them. She could not have even a birthday of her own. She hated Alexandra for looking like her, dressing like her, stealing the part of her grandmother\u0027s love that belonged to her. Alexandra adored Eve, and Eve despised her for that. Alexandra was generous, eager to give up her toys and dolls, and that filled Eve with still more contempt. Eve shared nothing. What was hers belonged to her, but it was not enough. She wanted everything Alexandra had. At night, under the watchful eye of Solange Dunas, both girls would say their prayers aloud, but Eve always added a silent prayer begging God to strike Alexandra dead. When the prayer went unanswered, Eve decided she would have to take care of it herself. Their fifth birthday was only a few days away, and Eve could not bear the thought of sharing another party with Alexandra. They were her friends, and her gifts that her sister was stealing from her. She had to kill Alexandra soon.\\n\\n On the night before their birthday, Eve lay in her bed, wide awake. When she was sure the household was asleep, she went over to Alexandra\u0027s bed and awakened her. \"Alex,\" she whispered, \"let\u0027s go down to the kitchen and see our birthday cakes.\"\\n\\n Alexandra said sleepily, \"Everybody\u0027s sleeping.\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t wake anyone up.\"\\n\\n \"Mademoiselle Dunas won\u0027t like it. Why don\u0027t we look at the cakes in the morning?\"\\n\\n \"Because I want to look at them now. Are you coming or not?\"\\n\\n Alexandra rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. She had no interest in seeing the birthday cakes, but she did not want to hurt her sister\u0027s feelings. \"I\u0027m coming,\" she said.\\n\\n Alexandra got out of bed and put on a pair of slippers. Both girls wore pink nylon nightgowns.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Eve said. \"And don\u0027t make any noise.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t,\" Alexandra promised.\\n\\n They tiptoed out of their bedroom, into the long corridor, past the closed door of Mademoiselle Dunas\u0027s bedroom, down the steep back stairs that led to the kitchen. It was an enormous kitchen, with two large gas stoves, six ovens, three refrigerators and a walk-in freezer.\\n\\n In the refrigerator Eve found the birthday cakes that the cook, Mrs. Tyler, had made. One of them said Happy Birthday, Alexandra. The other said Happy Birthday, Eve.\\n\\n Next year, Eve thought happily, there will only be one.\\n\\n Eve took Alexandra\u0027s cake out of the refrigerator and placed it on the wooden chopping block in the middle of the kitchen. She opened a drawer and took out a package of brightly colored candles.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Alexandra asked.\\n\\n \"I want to see how it looks with the candles all lighted.\" Eve began pressing the candles into the icing of the cake.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you should do that, Eve. You\u0027ll ruin the cake. Mrs. Tyler is going to be angry.\"\\n\\n \"She won\u0027t mind.\" Eve opened another drawer and took out two large boxes of kitchen matches. \"Come on, help me.\"\\n\\n \"I want to go back to bed.\"\\n\\n Eve turned on her angrily. \"All right. Go back to bed, scaredy cat. I\u0027ll do it alone.\"\\n\\n Alexandra hesitated. \"What do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n Eve handed her one of the boxes of matches. \"Start lighting the candles.\"\\n\\n Alexandra was afraid of fire. Both girls had been warned again and again about the danger of playing with matches. They knew the horror stories about children who had disobeyed that rule. But Alexandra did not want to disappoint Eve, and so she obediently began lighting the candles.\\n\\n Eve watched her a moment. \"You\u0027re leaving out the ones on the other side, silly,\" she said.\\n\\n Alexandra leaned over to reach the candles at the far side of the cake, her back to Eve. Quickly, Eve struck a match and touched it to the matches in the box she was holding. As they burst into flames, Eve dropped the box at Alexandra\u0027s feet, so that the bottom of Alexandra\u0027s nightgown caught fire. It was an instant before Alexandra was aware of what was happening. When she felt the first agonizing pain against her legs, she looked down and screamed, \"Help! Help me!\"\\n\\n Eve stared at the flaming nightgown a moment, awed by the extent of her success. Alexandra was standing there, petrified, frozen with fear.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t move!\" Eve said. \"I\u0027ll get a bucket of water.\" She hurried off to the butler\u0027s pantry, her heart pounding with a fearful joy.\\n\\n It was a horror movie that saved Alexandra\u0027s life. Mrs. Tyler, the Blackwells\u0027 cook, had been escorted to the cinema by a police sergeant whose bed she shared from time to time. On this particular evening, the motion-picture screen was so filled with dead and mutilated bodies that finally Mrs. Tyler could bear it no longer. In the middle of a beheading, she said, \"This may all be in a day\u0027s work for you, Richard, but I\u0027ve had enough.\"\\n\\n Sergeant Richard Dougherty reluctantly followed her out of the theater.\\n\\n They arrived back at the Blackwell mansion an hour earlier than they had expected to, and as Mrs. Tyler opened the back door, she heard Alexandra\u0027s screams coming from the kitchen. Mrs. Tyler and Sergeant Dougherty rushed in, took one horrified look at the scene before them and went into action. The sergeant leaped at Alexandra and ripped off her flaming nightgown. Her legs and hips were blistered, but the flames had not reached her hair or the front of her body. Alexandra fell to the floor, unconscious. Mrs. Tyler filled a large pot with water and poured it over the flames licking at the floor.\\n\\n \"Call an ambulance,\" Sergeant Dougherty ordered. \"Is Mrs. Blackwell home?\"\\n\\n \"She should be upstairs asleep.\"\\n\\n \"Wake her up.\"\\n\\n As Mrs. Tyler finished phoning for an ambulance, there was a cry from the butler\u0027s pantry, and Eve ran in carrying a pan of water, sobbing hysterically. \"Is Alexandra dead?\" Eve screamed. \"Is she dead?\"\\n\\n Mrs. Tyler took Eve in her arms to soothe her. \"No, darling, she\u0027s all right. She\u0027s going to be just fine.\"\\n\\n \"It was my fault,\" Eve sobbed. \"She wanted to light the candles on her birthday cake. I shouldn\u0027t have let her do it.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Tyler stroked Eve\u0027s back. \"It\u0027s all right. You mustn\u0027t blame yourself.\"\\n\\n \"The m-matches fell out of my hand, and Alex caught on fire. It was t-terrible.\"\\n\\n Sergeant Dougherty looked at Eve and said sympathetically, \"Poor child.\"\\n\\n \"Alexandra has second-degree burns on her legs and back,\" Dr. Harley told Kate, \"but she\u0027s going to be fine. We can do amazing things with burns these days. Believe me, this could have been a terrible tragedy.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Kate said. She had seen Alexandra\u0027s burns, and they had filled her with horror. She hesitated a moment. \"John, I think I\u0027m even more concerned about Eve.\"\\n\\n \"Was Eve hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Not physically, but the poor child blames herself for the accident. She\u0027s having terrible nightmares. The last three nights I\u0027ve had to go in and hold her in my arms before she could go back to sleep. I don\u0027t want this to become more traumatic. Eve is very sensitive.\"\\n\\n \"Kids get over things pretty quickly, Kate. If there\u0027s any problem, let me know, and I\u0027ll recommend a child therapist.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Kate said gratefully.\\n\\n Eve was terribly upset. The birthday party had been canceled. Alexandra cheated me out of that, Eve thought bitterly.\\n\\n Alexandra healed perfectly, with no signs of scars. Eve got over her feelings of guilt with remarkable ease. As Kate assured her, \"Accidents can happen to anybody, darling. You mustn\u0027t blame yourself.\"\\n\\n Eve didn\u0027t. She blamed Mrs. Tyler. Why did she have to come home and spoil everything? It had been a perfect plan.\\n\\n The sanitarium where Tony was confined was in a peaceful, wooded area in Connecticut. Kate was driven out to see him once a month. The lobotomy had been successful. There was no longer the slightest sign of aggression in Tony. He recognized Kate and he always politely asked about Eve and Alexandra, but he showed no interest in seeing them. He showed very little interest in anything. He seemed happy. No, not happy, Kate corrected herself. Content. But content - to do what?\\n\\n Kate asked Mr. Burger, the superintendent of the asylum, \"Doesn\u0027t my son do anything all day?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Blackwell. He sits by the hour and paints.\"\\n\\n Her son, who could have owned the world, sat and painted all day. Kate tried not to think of the waste, that brilliant mind gone forever. \"What does he paint?\"\\n\\n The man was embarrassed. \"No one can quite figure it out.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-24.html","bookId":2358,"book":{"id":2358,"title":"Master of the Game","description":"Storyline: WHO IS KATE BLACKWELL? \\n She is the symbol of success, the beautiful woman who parlayed her inheritance into an international conglomerate.
