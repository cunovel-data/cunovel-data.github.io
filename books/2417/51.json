{"id":76259,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"Willis Daniels was sitting in the driver\u0027s seat. If he noticed me walking up, he didn\u0027t let on. At least not until I stood at the window for a few seconds.\\n\\n The old man looked up from his book and smiled a tight smile. \"Mr. Navarre.\"\\n\\n He offered to shake, gentlemanly. His hand lacked any of the energy it had had when I\u0027d first shaken it, outside Silo Studios a hundred years ago.\\n\\n \"You not hungry?\" I asked.\\n\\n The smile took on a kind of sad amusement. \"I\u0027d just be in the way. You go on.\"\\n\\n He went back to his book, sighed. It would\u0027ve been easier if he\u0027d yelled at me, or frowned at least. I went inside.\\n\\n Milo and Miranda were drinking coffee at the table by the window.\\n\\n Saying Milo looked nice is superfluous, but somehow there was shock value in seeing him immaculate again after the way he\u0027d looked on that warehouse floor, then in the hospital bed. His trousers were dark and freshly pressed, his white shirt crisp with starch. The bandages underneath the shirt made his left shoulder look bulkier than the right. He was wearing a diamond stud earring and his shortcropped black hair looked freshly trimmed along the edges.\\n\\n He hooked a pink chair with his fingers and dragged it out from the table.\\n\\n \"Have a seat, Tres.\"\\n\\n I sat between them.\\n\\n Miranda was wearing lightly tinted round sunglasses. She\u0027d chosen all white today—long skirt, blouse with just enough motherofpearl studs to put it into the Western category, white anklelength boots. Even her hair, dark and curly, was pulled back in a white headband, making her forehead look high and her sunglasses that much more obvious.\\n\\n She was looking into her coffee, holding it with both hands. She glanced up briefly at me, then down again.\\n\\n \"Here.\" I set my shoe box next to Milo\u0027s untouched plate of tinfoilwrapped tacos.\\n\\n Milo scowled, lifted the lid, then closed it again.\\n\\n At a table across the way one of the construction workers had apparently seen what was inside the box. He said, \"Holy shit\" very quietly and nudged his friend.\\n\\n \"You brought me cash?\" Milo asked, incredulous.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the way I found it.\"\\n\\n Milo looked at me, a little puzzled by my tone. \"All right. Fifty thousand?\"\\n\\n \"Half.\"\\n\\n He looked at me longer.\\n\\n \"Problem?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Very possibly.\"\\n\\n \"The rest I\u0027m giving to Allison. The way things are shaping up, it may be the only thing she gets out of this deal.\"\\n\\n Milo let his eyes slide over to Miranda, who looked suddenly very sad.\\n\\n \"Allison,\" Milo repeated. \"You know that this is agency money, Les\u0027 and mine. You know she doesn\u0027t have claim to it—why the fuck—\"\\n\\n \"You want to talk to the IRS, go. I\u0027m sure you were planning on reporting this recovered.\"\\n\\n Milo closed his mouth. His eyes had the bull fierceness in them, but he was trying hard to keep it from the surface.\\n\\n \"I hoped we could be a little more constructive here. I didn\u0027t want—\" He shook his head, disappointed. \"Christ, Tres, it\u0027s not like we don\u0027t owe you something, but—\"\\n\\n He let me see a little bit inside, a little bit of hurt and discomfort, the sense that we were still friends.\\n\\n I turned to Miranda. \"You happy with your deal?\"\\n\\n The question took her by surprise, or maybe it was just the fact that I spoke to her at all.\\n\\n She sat up, away from me just slightly. \"I will be, yes. I\u0027m grateful to you. But—\"\\n\\n She was steeling herself to say something, probably something she\u0027d rehearsed with Milo before coming here.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t quite manage it. She swallowed and looked on the verge of tears. It was a look she did well.\\n\\n \"Miranda\u0027s relocating to Nashville,\" Milo supplied. \"We both are.\"\\n\\n I turned my attention back to him. \"You both are.\"\\n\\n Somehow the words seemed absurd. I felt like I was speaking Spanish, when I hit an unfamiliar colloquialism and the sense of almost being fluent came to a grinding stop.\\n\\n Milo unwrapped one of his tacos, peeling back the tinfoil with the detached interest of a coroner. A plume of steam zigzagged up from the eggs.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve been lucky things have worked out as well as they have,\" he explained. \"Very lucky. We owe you for that, but we thought it would be best—Miranda needs to be closer to the action.\"\\n\\n I stared at Miranda. She wouldn\u0027t meet my eyes.\\n\\n \"We just wanted you to know,\" Milo continued. \"There\u0027s a lot of outstanding problems from all of this. Until Miranda\u0027s career really gets going, things are going to be fragile.\\n\\n Miranda needs a clean break from everything that\u0027s happened.\"\\n\\n I kept staring.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s lost family here,\" Milo continued. \"She can\u0027t keep being reminded of that. We want to make sure you feel compensated, but you need to be out of the picture, Tres.\\n\\n I\u0027m going to insist on that.\"\\n\\n \"Compensated,\" I said. Another foreign term. I looked at Miranda. \"You plan on compensating the others, too—Cam, Sheck, Les? How about Brent and Julie Kearnes?\"\\n\\n Miranda wiped a tear away. She was wavering between sorrow and anger, trying to decide what approach would be the most effective.\\n\\n \"That ain\u0027t fair, Tres,\" she muttered, hoarsely. \"It just ain\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"How long until Milo gets the cleanbreak message, from somebody in Nashville, some slightly bigger big shot who\u0027s decided he can look out for your interests better? A week ago you told me Allison was the only person who scared you to death, Miranda. I\u0027ve met somebody scarier.\"\\n\\n \"Stop,\" Milo insisted.\\n\\n He was strictly lawyer now. Our relationship was about thirty seconds old and would fade as soon as the conversation was over, like finger pokes on bread dough.\\n\\n I stood to leave. The waitress came over and offered me coffee apologetically, apparently thinking she\u0027d been too slow. When I didn\u0027t respond she raised her eyebrows, offended, and walked away.\\n\\n \"You kept your promise, Chavez,\" I said. \"You made sure things didn\u0027t work out like last time.\"\\n\\n I walked outside.\\n\\n When I got to the car Willis Daniels didn\u0027t even bother looking up from his book. He was smiling his peaceful, Santa Claus dayafterChristmas smile.\\n\\n Through the window of the Sunset Cafe I could see Miranda crying, Milo\u0027s huge hand on her shoulder. He was speaking to her reassuringly, probably telling her she\u0027d done what she had to. That it got easier from here.\\n\\n There was nobody in the VW to do that for me.\\n\\n It was just as well. I would\u0027ve slugged them.\\n\\n I turned right on Broadway and headed for the airport. I had a plane to say goodbye to.\\n\\n 57\\n\\n San Antonio\u0027s main terminal was lollipopshaped— a long corridor with a carousel of gates at the end. At the centre of the circle was a magazine kiosk and a pricey snack shop and a souvenir stand where you had your last chance to buy authentic Texas pickled jalapenos and stuffed armadillos and rattlesnakein plastic toilet seats.\\n\\n The American flight for New York would be departing from gate twelve. I was an hour early. A flight from Denver had just deplaned—a few businessmen, a couple of college kids, lots of pale retirees, winter Texans.\\n\\n I got myself a fourdollar draft beer at the bar and sat at a table behind a row of bromeliads, facing the gate. At the table next to me a couple of outofuniform airmen were trading stories. They\u0027d just been let out of basic training at Lackland and were heading home on leave for a week. One of them was talking about his wife.\\n\\n Nobody I wanted to see came to the gate. The desk wasn\u0027t checking anybody\u0027s tickets yet. A couple of stewardesses ambled out of the gate, all blond hair and long legs and wheeled luggage. The overweight captain walked behind them, appreciating the view.\\n\\n Over by the window a little Latino kid who reminded me a lot of Jem was putting his face against the glass wall of the observation area. He blew his mouth against the glass until his cheeks puffed out, then ran a few feet and did it again. The glass was a smudgy drooling foggy mess for a good twenty feet. Dad was a couple of rows away, watching sports coverage on an overhead TV. He probably wasn\u0027t much older than I was. The kid was probably five.\\n\\n Finally a ticket checker changed the signs on the gate display. NEW YORK. ON TIME.\\n\\n He clacked a few keys on his computer terminal, then joked a little with one of the airport custodians.\\n\\n Passengers started to arrive.\\n\\n The airmen got up and left, shaking hands. One was heading to Montana. I didn\u0027t know about the other.\\n\\n I bought another fourdollar beer.\\n\\n The little Latino boy got tired of sliming the windows and came over to climb on his dad. Dad didn\u0027t much care. Pretty soon it looked like Dad was growing a small pair of flailing blue Keds out of his shoulder blades.\\n\\n Finally the newly christened Allen Meissner arrived, twenty minutes before flight time, just before the airline would start preboarding. He was wearing a cowboy hat that shaded his face pretty well and clear glasses and faded denim clothes that weren\u0027t his normal look. He\u0027d dyed his hair a shade or two lighter and I suspected that his cowboy boots were a little taller than they needed to be. He\u0027d taken lessons on how to disguise himself, just like he\u0027d taken lessons on how to construct his new paper identity. He wouldn\u0027t have attracted any casual onlookers. He would\u0027ve stood a fair chance of slipping by any random encounters with acquaintances, unless they knew who they were looking for. I did. He was definitely my man.\\n\\n The new Mr. Meissner was travelling light—a single backpack, dark green. It was pretty much exactly like mine.\\n\\n I walked up behind him as he was getting his boarding pass.\\n\\n I let him check in, answer the questions, mumbled thank you to the attendant. When he turned around he ran into me at such short range that my face didn\u0027t register. He started to plow around me, the way strangers do, just another bumper in the pinball game.\\n\\n Then I took his upper arm and backed him up.\\n\\n He focused on my face.\\n\\n \"Hey, Allen,\" I said.\\n\\n I\u0027ve seen a lot of shades of red in my time but never one quite that bright, quite that quick to take over a complexion. I\u0027m not sure what Brent Daniels would\u0027ve done if we\u0027d met under different circumstances, but here in a crowd, without a backup plan, he was stuck. It was my call.\\n\\n \"Buy me a beer,\" I said.\\n\\n For one second I really thought he was going to bolt. His knuckles on the strap of the backpack went white. Then he shoved past me, angry but slow—heading for the bar like a kid who\u0027d been told to go to the principal\u0027s office and knew the way by heart.\\n\\n We sat at the same table I\u0027d been occupying. My seat was still warm. Brent slid across from me with a beer. One for me—none for him. He passed the beer over and then waited for my reaction, like I might tell him he could go now.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"New York,\" I said. \"Where then?\"\\n\\n Brent let out a little hiss of air. He looked strange with the fake prescription glasses, older somehow. He also looked strange because for the first time, he\u0027d taken pains with his appearance. Real pains. He was closely shaven and immaculately clean. Not bad for a guy who had been a charred pile of ashes a few days ago.\\n\\n Apparently a few papery lies floated through his mind before he decided not to try them. Finally he just said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Les hadn\u0027t thought it that far ahead?\" I asked. \"Or you just don\u0027t know what he had planned?\"\\n\\n Brent shook his head. \"What do you want, Navarre?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-51.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) \\n Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. \\n The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murder—and he may be the next to be snakebit.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}}
