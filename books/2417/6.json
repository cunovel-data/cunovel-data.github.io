You know what I hate about it? They always have to test you. They give you one small corner of a case and wait to see how you\u0027ll handle it. Sometimes that caution works out okay. More often it leaves you operating with a dangerously incomplete picture and somebody winds up hurt. Seeing as we\u0027ve known each other for fifteen years, seeing as we\u0027ve been down this road before, I figured we\u0027d be skipping the test stage. I guess I was wrong.\"\\n\\n Milo tapped his fingers. \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"All right, what?\"\\n\\n \"I made some calls about you over the last week, after you agreed to look at Julie Kearnes.\"\\n\\n \"Calls,\" I repeated. \"What kind of calls?\"\\n\\n \"Roger Schumman, for one. He said you did nice work—said you threw a loan shark through his office window extremely well. Manny Forester had good things to say, too.\\n\\n Seems you know how to get discreet results with skip traces. He said if all his thugs had Ph.D.s maybe they\u0027d be as reliable as you.\"\\n\\n \"You called for references. On me.\"\\n\\n Milo shrugged. \"It\u0027s been a long time since San Francisco, Navarre. I figured you\u0027d turn out to be good at this kind of work. I was glad to find out I was right.\"\\n\\n \"No more tests, Milo. What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n Milo started to say something, then stopped. He tapped his fingers. \"Les isn\u0027t in Nashville. He\u0027s been missing for over two weeks.\"\\n\\n I took a plastic knife, reached over, and cut off half of the uneaten cheeseburger in Milo\u0027s basket. \"And you haven\u0027t told the police, even after what happened to Julie Kearnes?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that simple. Les—\" Milo searched for the right phrase, something legally neutral. Finally he gave up. \"Les screws up a lot. He\u0027s eccentric. He drinks, he has some other bad habits. Sometimes he\u0027ll go off on a binge for a few days and we\u0027ll have to cover by saying he\u0027s out of town, like we\u0027re doing now. I can\u0027t be sure—\"\\n\\n \"Has he ever been gone this long before?\"\\n\\n Milo shook his head. \"But still—\" His voice trailed off in disappointment, not buying what he was about to say.\\n\\n \"You think his disappearance might be connected to the missing demo tape,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And the gunshots at John Crea. Now Julie Kearnes\u0027 murder. You think it might all be part of a package—somebody pissed off because of this deal you\u0027re working on.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of.\"\\n\\n \"The wife hasn\u0027t reported Les missing?\"\\n\\n The look of distaste on Milo\u0027s face told me Mrs. Saint Pierre was not his favourite subject. \"Let me tell you about Les SaintPierre and his wife and the police. About six months ago, the last time Les took off, Allison went to Missing Persons. You know what they told her? \"\\n\\n I ate some cheeseburger. I waited.\\n\\n \"They told her Les was already missing. For seven years. Seems a former girlfriend had the same problem with him disappearing, reported Les and forgot to let the police know when he\u0027d come home. The Bureau never bothered to follow up, take him off the rolls. Can you believe that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been known to happen. MPB is flooded with domestics that are resolved ninety percent of the time before they\u0027re even assigned.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well. This time Allison isn\u0027t in any hurry. Les joked from time to time about running away to Mexico.\\n\\n Allison figures maybe he finally did it and she\u0027s not crying any tears.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not talking just Missing Persons this time, Milo. Homicide is going to want to talk to Les. You\u0027ve got to tell them.\"\\n\\n Milo pulled on the back of his neck. \"It\u0027s more complicated than that, Navarre. It\u0027s one thing for our clients to think Les is eccentric—that he slips out of pocket for a few days now and then. That his wife reports him gone after a fight or whatever. People can give him some slack there because he\u0027s Les SaintPierre. But the minute somebody hears a rumour he\u0027s honesttoGod missing—that I\u0027m looking for him, that it\u0027s just Milo holding down the fort—\"\\n\\n He raised his hands off the table. \"I need to find Les. Quickly and quietly. And I don\u0027t have time to shop around for help.\"\\n\\n \"You know how to flatter a guy.\"\\n\\n He reached into his pocket and pulled out a money roll only Milo could\u0027ve carried without his pants bulging obscenely—fiftydollar bills wrapped as thick as a Coke can.\\n\\n \"Your boss doesn\u0027t like the case, we can cut out the middle man.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t have my own license. At this point it looks like I might never.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just as well.\"\\n\\n \"I told you, I\u0027m thinking about getting out of this line of work.\"\\n\\n Milo put the cylinder of money sideways on the table and rolled it in my direction.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to look into Kearnes\u0027 murder anyway, Navarre. You couldn\u0027t put down something that happened on your watch—I know you better than that. Why not let me pay you?\"\\n\\n Maybe I felt like I owed him. Or maybe I was thinking about how long I\u0027d known him, off and on since high school, always reconnecting with each other at the least opportune moments like bad acoustical echoes.\\n\\n Or maybe I\u0027m kidding myself. Maybe what swayed me more was that roll of money—the prospect of paying my rent on time for once and not having to borrow gro\\n\\n cery money from my mother.\\n\\n I heard myself saying, \"What exactly do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n 7\\n\\n The Les SaintPierre Talent Agency was a gray and maroon Victorian on West Ashby, across the street from the Koehler Museum.\\n\\n Even without a sign in front you could tell the old residence had been converted for business. The powercolour combination, the uniform blinds on the windows, the wellkept but totally impersonal landscaping, the Texas flag windsock hanging on the empty front porch—it all screamed \"office building.\"\\n\\n There were two cars already parked at the bottom of the hill in front. One was a tan Volvo wagon. When I met Milo on the sidewalk he was staring at the other— a glistening black pickup truck that looked like it had been converted at great expense from a semi rig. It had wheels just shy of monster size, tinted windows with security alarm decals on the corners, orange pin striping, mud flaps with silver silhouettes of Barbie doll women on them. The cab looked like it could sleep four comfortably.\\n\\n Milo said, \"This isn\u0027t my day.\"\\n\\n Before I could ask what he meant, he turned and lumbered up the steps.\\n\\n Inside, the Victorian was all hardwood floors and creamcolored walls. A staircase led up from the main foyer. The double doorway on the right opened into a reception area with a couple of wicker chairs, a mahogany desk, a fireplace, and a Turkish rug. A very big Anglo man in his early fifties was sitting on the edge of the desk, talking with Gladys the receptionist.\\n\\n When I say very big and I\u0027m standing next to Milo I have to correct myself. This guy wasn\u0027t like Milo, but he was big by any other definition. Tall and barrelchested. Thick neck. Powerful hands. He had the build of a derrick worker.\\n\\n Despite the heat he wore a denim jacket over his white shirt, new blue jeans, black Justin boots. He was twirling a Stetson on one finger while he talked.\\n\\n When he saw Milo, his smile hardened.\\n\\n \"Hola, Mario.\"\\n\\n Milo walked placidly to the desk and picked up a stack of mail. He didn\u0027t look at his visitor. \"Fuck you, Sheckly. You know my name.\"\\n\\n \"Hey now—\" Sheckly spoke with the twangy, hard edged accent of a GermanTexan, someone who\u0027d grown up in the hill country around Fredericksburg, where many of the families still spoke a brand of cowboy Deutsch. \"Play nice with me, son. I just dropped by to see how things were coming along. Have to make sure you\u0027re doing right by my girl. You remind Les about that contract yet?\"\\n\\n Milo kept flipping through his mail. \"Les is still in Nashville. I\u0027ll tell him you dropped by.\\n\\n The contract\u0027s right next to the toilet where he left it.\"\\n\\n Sheckly\u0027s laugh was a rich chuckle. He kept twirling the Stetson. \"Come on now, son.\\n\\n You want to dispute our agreement, you\u0027ve got to put me in touch with the boss man.\\n\\n Otherwise I\u0027m expecting Miranda in the Split Rail studio come November first and I\u0027ll tell you what else—you send Century that demo and I\u0027ll send them a copy of my contract, see if they want to sink their money into a girl who\u0027s gonna bring their legal department a mess of business.\"\\n\\n Milo opened another letter. \"You know where the door is.\"\\n\\n Sheckly got up from the desk slowly, told the receptionist, \"You think about it,\" then started walking out.\\n\\n In front of me he stopped and offered to shake. \"Tilden Sheckly. Most people call me Sheck.\"\\n\\n Up close, it looked like all the unnecessary pigments in Mr. Sheckly\u0027s face had drained into his tan, which was dark and perfect. His eyes were so bleached blue they were almost white. His lips had no red at all. His hair had probably been thick and chocolaty at one time. It had faded to a dusty brownishgray, uncombable tufts that looked like clumps of moth wings.\\n\\n I told him my name.\\n\\n \"I know who you are,\" he said. \"I knew your father.\"\\n\\n \"Lots of people knew my father.\"\\n\\n Sheck grinned, but it wasn\u0027t friendly. He looked like I\u0027d missed the joke. \"I suppose so.\\n\\n Most of them didn\u0027t contribute as much as I did.\"\\n\\n Then he put on the Stetson and said goodbye.\\n\\n When he was gone Milo turned to Gladys. \"What did he mean, \u0027think about it\u0027?\"\\n\\n Gladys said Sheck had offered her a secretarial job with a fifty percent pay raise. She said she\u0027d turned him down. She sounded a little wistful about it.\\n\\n Milo stared at the space on the desk where Sheck had been sitting. He looked like he was contemplating putting his fist through the mahogany. \"You do those calls yet?\"\\n\\n Gladys shook her head. She launched into a long story about how some club owner in San Marcos had called and complained that Eli Watts and His Sunrisers had torn up the hotel room he\u0027d rented for them and now he wanted the agency to pay the damages. Gladys had spent her entire morning trying to smooth things out.\\n\\n I thought the desk was going to get it, but slowly Milo\u0027s meaty fists unclenched. He mumbled something under his breath, then led me down the hall and into his office.\\n\\n Everything in the converted parlour had been custom made for Milo\u0027s comfort—two massive red leather chairs, a halfton oak desk with a twentyoneinch computer monitor and a candy bowl the size of a basketball, bookshelves that started as high as most bookshelves stopped and went all the way to the ceiling. The only thing small was Milo\u0027s rosewood Yamaha acoustic in the corner, the same guitar he used to bring on our drunken college road trips into the Sonoma wine country. There was still a crescentshaped dent near the sound hole where I\u0027d thrown a beer can at Milo and missed.\\n\\n I sat across the desk from Milo.\\n\\n On the right wall were framed pictures of Les Saint Pierre\u0027s past and present artists. I recognized several country stars. Nobody recent. Nobody I would\u0027ve considered huge.\\n\\n Prominently displayed in the centre was a photo of the Miranda Daniels Band—six people at a bar in a honky tonk, all facing out toward the camera and trying to look casual, like they lined up that way every night. Julie Kearnes and Miranda Daniels were shoulder to shoulder in the middle, sitting up on the bar with their cowboy boots crossed at the ankles and their denim skirts carefully arranged to show some calf. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-6.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) \\n Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. \\n The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murder—and he may be the next to be snakebit.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}}
