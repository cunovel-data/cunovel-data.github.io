{"id":76232,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"There was a shoe box on the bureau top, full of correspondence that looked carefully picked through. Drawers were open. A pair of rubber gloves was draped over the top one and the chair was pushed out as if someone had just gotten up from it. Sam Barrera\u0027s work, halffinished. Maybe it was possible that even Barrera got the creeps, alone in a dark house, going through paperwork with a dead man right next to you on the bed. Maybe even Barrera had to take a Corn Pops break from that kind of work. I didn\u0027t throw up. I somehow made it all the way back down the stairs, back into the kitchen where Barrera was still eating, one hand holding the .22 flat against the tabletop. \"Can I sit down?\" I asked. Barrera examined my face, maybe saw that I wasn\u0027t doing so hot. He waved at the stool opposite his. I sat, took a few breaths. \"I take it you haven\u0027t called the police.\" Sam lifted his right ear just slightly, like God was telling him something. \"Blanceagle\u0027s been dead two days. He can wait another few hours. Now I\u0027m going to ask you what I asked Erainya: What\u0027s your business with Blanceagle? With Les SaintPierre?\" I stared at Barrera\u0027s cereal bowl, the little gold ball bearings in the white grease. My stomach did a somersault. Barrera said, \"Try some. It\u0027ll help. Corn products are good.\" \"No thanks. Erainya doesn\u0027t have any business with Blanceagle. I\u0027m on my own.\" \"On your own,\" he repeated. \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Unlicensed.\" I nodded. Sam shook his head and looked sour, like his worst assumptions about human nature had just been confirmed. \"Tell me everything,\" he ordered. \"And then?\" \"And then we\u0027ll see.\" I told him the basics. Sam asked a few questions— what did Jean look like, what exactly had Les Saint Pierre told Milo Chavez about his plan to force Tilden Sheckly\u0027s cooperation. Twice Barrera dug out handfuls of dry Corn Pops from the box and ate them, one pop at a time. When I was done talking he said, \"I\u0027ve already spoken with Detective Schaeffer at SAPD. I\u0027ll talk to the Hollywood Park police. You were never here tonight. You are not working on this anymore.\" \"Just like that.\" \"Tell Mr. Chavez he\u0027ll have to do the best he can for his artists. Tell him Les SaintPierre will probably show up on his own sooner or later and there\u0027s no problem with Tilden Sheckly as far as you can determine.\" \"And that Santa Claus is getting him a nice tricycle for Christmas.\" Barrera frowned at me. He flexed his fingers and the gold rings rubbed together with a sound like seashells. \"This thing with the singer, Miranda Daniels,\" he said. \"This is a sideline. Forget it. You think it has anything to do with SaintPierre disappearing, you think a guy like Tilden Sheckly would waste his time with murders over a recording contract—\" Barrera paused. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve stepped into, Navarre. I\u0027m telling you to step back out.\" \"There\u0027re some shipments going through the Indian Paintbrush,\" I said. \"Something from Germany—big heavy cylinders. Blanceagle said the arrangement has been going on for about six years. Les SaintPierre found out about it from Julie Kearnes, who probably got it from Alex Blanceagle. Les threatened to expose the business to keep Sheckly from pressing his claims on Miranda Daniels. Les miscalculated—either how bad the information was or how violently Sheck would react. Now Les has disappeared and the two people who helped him get his information are dead. How am I doing?\" \"Not well,\" Barrera said. \"Shut up.\" \"You spoke to Alex Blanceagle at least once before— he told me another investigator had been poking around. You were in Austin Saturday night arguing with Julie Kearnes after I knocked off surveillance. At the time she wouldn\u0027t cooperate? she shooed you out of the house with a gun. By Sunday night, after I\u0027d rattled her too, maybe after she\u0027d gotten some calls from Sheck\u0027s people, she was scared enough to set up a meeting with you in San Antonio. Somehow Sheck found out about it. Julie still didn\u0027t trust you so she came armed, without any information written down. She got to your rendezvous a little early or you got there a little late and she got shot in the head. You got there, found a murder scene, and decided it was safest to drive on by and ask questions later. Who are you working for, Sam? What is Sheckly hiding that\u0027s worth killing people?\" Barrera stood up slowly, checked his gold watch. \"Gather your stuff. Go home and stay there. I\u0027m going to call it in.\" \"You\u0027ve got five fulltime operatives just at the San Antonio office, fifteen more regionally. You\u0027ve got a dozen national clients subcontracting investigations through you. If you\u0027re here in Blanceagle\u0027s living room yourself, taking trips up to Austin to argue with Julie Kearnes in person, this has to be big. Something your friends on the Bureau lined up for you, maybe.\" \" Your other option is that I turn you over to some of the agencies involved.\" \"Some of the agencies?\" \"People far out of your league, Navarre. They could make very sure you stay quiet. They would also have some hard questions for Erainya Manos about the way The Widower\u0027s Two it Step 169 that you\u0027re operating. We could be looking at a revoked license for her, a guarantee your application never comes up for review. That\u0027s all before we bring in the D.A.\" \"You\u0027d be such a bastard?\" Sam looked at me dispassionately. There was no implied threat. It was a simple multiplechoice test. \"All right.\" I started to gather up my money, my burglar\u0027s tools, my photos and paperwork. I stuffed it all into my backpack. My fingers didn\u0027t work very well. My stomach still felt fluttery, warm. Sam Barrera watched me zip my bag. I wouldn\u0027t say he relaxed, but his eyes got a little less intense. He put his gun in his belt, behind his coat. He tilted his head sideways, stretching his neck muscles, and the little shiny black square of hair on top of his head glistened. \"You said six years,\" he told me. \"That\u0027s about right. Maybe someday I\u0027ll show you my file cabinets, show you how a real case is put together. Maybe I can explain to you what it\u0027s like, all that buildup and documentation only to find an informant you\u0027ve been courting disappeared, then another one shot in the head the day you wanted to interview him. Then to have somebody like you waltz in and act like you own the situation. You\u0027re not doing Erainya any favours following this line of work, kid. You\u0027re not doing yourself any favours. Go home.\" I picked up my bag, got unsteadily to my feet. \"And Navarre—\" Sam said, \"you didn\u0027t find anything. Nothing to indicate Les SaintPierre\u0027s whereabouts. No documentation you can\u0027t explain.\" It took me a second to realize he was actually asking me a question rather than giving me another order. I stared at him until he felt obliged to add, \"SaintPierre was supposed to give me some information. It wasn\u0027t up there in Blanceagle\u0027s bedroom and it wasn\u0027t in Julie Kearnes\u0027 house.\" I shook my head. The only piece I hadn\u0027t told Barrera about was the personnel files, and those weren\u0027t blackmail material. At the moment they seemed a petty thing to hide, a grudgingly small way to get some revenge on Barrera. \"Nothing,\" I told him. \"I found nothing. Just the way you thought, Sam.\" He scrutinized my face, then nodded. When I left, he was just starting to talk to the Hollywood Park police on the phone, explaining to them exactly how they were going to handle his problem. 24 Milo\u0027s green Jeep Cherokee honked in my driveway at ten o\u0027clock Friday morning. I opened the passenger\u0027s side door and said, \"I don\u0027t believe it. She\u0027s alive.\" Sassy the basset hound sat up on the seat and yawned. Her tongue rolled into a long bologna canoe. She did a little shuffle on her front paws and snorted. Maybe it was a friendly greeting. Maybe she was having a doggie coronary. \"How old are you?\" I demanded. \"You make a deal with Satan?\" Sassy panted. She turned her head to the left, trying to see me through her one eye that was milky with cataracts. Where the other eye should\u0027ve been was a sagging canyon of gray crusty fur. \"Sassy\u0027s plugging along okay,\" Milo admitted. \"Got an abscess I have to drain every week.\" He showed me one of Sassy\u0027s silky brown ears that normally would\u0027ve made a perfect size ten and a half shoe liner. Today it looked like someone had sewn a squeeze bulb into it. Sassy kept grinning and panting as Milo examined the abscess. She turned her head side to side like somebody was calling her but she couldn\u0027t figure out from where. I\u0027d thought of Sassy as old when we\u0027d dognapped her from her abusive former owners in Berkeley eight years ago. By now Sassy must\u0027ve been pushing twenty. In canine years, she\u0027d been around since the Civil War. It wasn\u0027t easy moving her into the backseat. Imagine a sack of bowling balls with stubby feet and bad breath. When we finally got under way Milo broke out the extra soft geriatric dog biscuits for her and beer for us. He poured the beer into coffee cups. We exited Loop 410 on Broadway and headed south listening to Sassy chew. Most of the biscuit fell out the side of her mouth, but she went at it with gusto anyway. I handed Milo a single typewritten sheet of paper. He glanced at it as much as he could without losing his beer or running off the road. \"This is—\" \"My first report.\" He frowned. \"Your report? Am I paying extra for this?\" \"Erainya Manos is trying to instil me with some nasty habits—following procedures, writing daily reports to clients, stuff like that.\" He handed it back to me. \"Give me an audio version.\" I told him about Alex Blanceagle\u0027s murder. Then I told him what Samuel Barrera had said, about the party line I was supposed to give Milo to blow the case off. Sassy was apparently interested. She kept sticking her nose between the seats, trying to slobber her biscuit residue into my beer. When I finished Milo said, \"And you still think Les disappeared on his own?\" \"I think it\u0027s a strong possibility. I think he was using Julie Kearnes in more than one way. He got her to steal some personnel files from her temp jobs, probably sold her on the idea that they\u0027d be running off together, even brought over a suitcase as a show of good faith. Then he ditched her.\" \"And she didn\u0027t say anything to anyone. Why?\" \"She couldn\u0027t go bragging about what she\u0027d been doing, helping Les blackmail Sheckly. Maybe she was hoping Les would still come back for her. Maybe she just didn\u0027t want to admit she\u0027d been had.\" \"But you\u0027re not certain of any of that.\" \"That\u0027s why I want to look around Les\u0027 house.\" \"You\u0027ve seen what Sheckly is like, Navarre. Now Alex Blanceagle is dead. It doesn\u0027t take a genius to figure out what happened to Les.\" We drove a few blocks in silence. Milo could\u0027ve been right. It would\u0027ve been a lot easier on Milo to think his boss hadn\u0027t voluntarily left him waistdeep in trouble. It would be a lot easier on me to believe Les SaintPierre was just another corpse waiting to be found. Corpses are stationary targets. Otherwise, if Les SaintPierre had adopted a new identity with Julie Kearnes\u0027 help, then even with Kelly Arguello and me working overtime to find him, the chances of tracking him down were slim. The chances of tracking him down by next Friday, when Miranda\u0027s demo was due to Century Records, were virtually nonexistent. If Sheckly insisted on his bogus first option contract, there would be no effective way of challenging him. Miranda would go back to Sheckly\u0027s stable. She\u0027d become another hasbeen artist waiting to happen.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-24.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent.
