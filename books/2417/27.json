{"id":76235,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"I looked back at the salesman. He was a large man. Flabby large, with arms that had mass but no muscle lines. His face hadn\u0027t seen a razor blade or a toothbrush or even a nose hair clipper in a mighty long time. He had a HarleyDavidson Tshirt with cigarette burn holes on the belly. \"Cam\u0027s looked better,\" I said. Harley grinned. \"Some guy\u0027s been leaning on him. Some big ass motherfucker—private detective or something. He slammed Cam\u0027s head into a wall. Then last night he came back and did Cam\u0027s ribs.\" \"You saw this?\" Harley leaned closer to me. \"Naw, but you know what I told Cam—I said take me along next time. I\u0027ll put that dick motherfucker in a vise grip.\" I smiled appreciatively. The slow, distorted power chords of Bad Religion seeped through the glass window of the practice room. Cam nodded his head and the adolescent smiled. Talent under development. \"He\u0027ll want to talk to me,\" I told Harley. \"Tell him it\u0027s the dick motherfucker.\" Harley started to laugh, then he saw I was serious. He scratched his beard. He pointed at me with his thumb and tried to frame a question. \"I don\u0027t know about the ribs,\" I amended. \"I just did the forehead. And it was a beer keg. You get prettier bruises with a beer keg.\" Harley searched his beard with his fingers a little more. Then slowly he cracked a grin. He turned and started what he\u0027d been doing before I came in—hanging guitar straps on a rotating display. \"Cam ain\u0027t much of a boss,\" Harley told me. \"Be my guest.\" I walked into the practice room. Cam was nodding his head and saying encouraging things about the adolescent\u0027s Fchord. Then they both saw me. I winked at the kid and told him to keep up the good work with the Fchord. Then I looked at Cam, whose purplish forehead was turning almost flesh colour. \"How you feeling?\" \"Got a student,\" he managed to say. \"He can practice.\" I turned to the kid. \"I bet you know \u0027Glycerine\u0027 already, don\u0027t you, Slick?\" The kid got that elated light in his eyes that beginning guitarists get when they actually know a request. He looked down and dutifully began plinking out the Bush song. \"Let\u0027s talk,\" I told Cam. \"Why you think I\u0027d want to—\" \"I went to see Alex Blanceagle last night. He looks a lot worse than you do. Jean paid him a visit.\" Cam\u0027s beady, bloodshot eyes move an inch farther apart. He looked around uncomfortably, at his student, at Harley who was grinning sideways at us through the glass, waiting for some kind of show to start. Cam put his guitar pick between his lips and spoke around it. \"Upstairs. And you ain\u0027t gonna fuck with me again, y\u0027hear?\" I held up my hands. Truce. Harley looked disappointed when he saw we were taking our conversation elsewhere. Cam led me out into the afternoon heat, then up the stairs and into his place. He headed straight for the refrigerator. His apartment was about the same size as mine—one main room, closet, bathroom, side kitchen. An unmade twin bed set flush against the south wall was occupied by piles of laundry that still retained the upsidedown shape and crisscrossed texture of laundry baskets, like Jell0 out of the moulds. I counted three guitars in the room— two electrics in open cases on the floor? one black Ovation twelvestring on a corner tripod stand. The coffee table was a Sears appliance box covered with spare guitar tuning pegs and string packets and old Olympia cans and an extra large Funky Bird, the kind with the red hair and the hat and the big butt that bobs up and down. Instead of chairs Cam had guitar amps. The posters on the walls were all from the store downstairs—peeling advertisements of bikini girls showing off the latest thing in mixing boards or speakers or trap sets. The only thing in the room that reflected care and meticulous upkeep was the CD collection. That took up three levels of cinder block and board shelving. I walked over and looked through the titles while Cam was rummaging for beer. The CDs were all kinds, rock and jazz and country guitarists, heavy on the Eric Clapton and the Chet Atkins and too light on the Blind Willie McTell for my taste. The titles were perfectly arranged in alphabetical order except that the top shelf started with Cam\u0027s own releases. I was surprised how many—at least fifteen different CDs. I pulled one. The cover art was a bad photocopy of Cam\u0027s face, with his name and the title \"American Cowboy\" and the rest of the liner notes in what looked like Cyrillic script. Russian? Czech? I checked the other titles. Most were similar foreign releases. Only one was labelled Split Rail Records, dated five years ago and entitled The Best of Cam Compton. Probably went platinum, that one. Cam opened himself an Olympia and walked over to the bed like he was in pain. He knocked the laundry off and sat down slowly, elbows out, the way you\u0027d lower yourself into an extrahot bathtub. \"Your ribs are taped,\" I said. \"Somebody gave you a talkingto last night.\" \"What the fuck business is that to you?\" I took the stack of Compton\u0027s own CDs and went over to an amp and sat down, facing him. I started flipping through the jewel cases. \"Interesting discography. Bulgaria. Romania. Germany. You must have had some success over there.\" Cam studied me warily. His one eye with the bloody ring around the iris was almost closed. His urge to play silent was duking it out with his urge to talk about himself. The latter finally won. \"Good market in Europe,\" he admitted. \" \u0027Specially since the Eastern parts opened. Had me a number ten song for a week in Yugoslavia \u0027fore the country broke up.\" \"That so?\" He nodded morosely, like the whole political mess had been a plot to get him off the charts. \"Course Germany\u0027s always loved Texas stuff—horses, cowboy hats, country music. They cain\u0027t get enough of that shit. Sheckly had me touring some honkytonk clubs over there four or five times. Good money.\" \"Yeah?\" I held up the CD I\u0027d been looking at earlier. \"What\u0027s this—Russian?\" Cam grunted. He was drinking more beer, warming up to the subject. \"Fan sent that to me with a real nice letter. Said it wasn\u0027t playing right anymore and she loved it, could I please send her a copy of the American original. Goodlooking girl, too.\" \"You sent it?\" \"Couldn\u0027t. There is no original. It\u0027s a bootleg of one of my shows in Munich. Half the titles in there are boots. Hell, half the titles in Europe. Now you gonna tell me about Alex B.?\" I put the CDs aside. \"I came here to help you, Cam.\" He stopped with his beer can halfway to his mouth, put the can down. \"That a fact? You get me fired one day, now you\u0027re gonna help me.\" \"Alex Blanceagle was shot dead.\" He blinked, kept his eyes closed a second too long. \"And what\u0027s it got to do with me?\" \"He was talking to a man named Samuel Barrera about Sheckly\u0027s business. In particular those shipments you\u0027ve been helping process through the Indian Paintbrush.\" Cam put together a smile. He rubbed the bruise on his forehead. \"I ain\u0027t been close to Sheck for a long time, son. Last help I gave him was signing up with Miranda\u0027s band. Look where that got me. Sheck has some other kind of problem, it ain\u0027t mine.\" \"I know different, Cam. Samuel Barrera\u0027s exFBI and he\u0027s very good. He\u0027ll come talking to you eventually. With something like this he\u0027ll have Customs involved, the State Attorney, the D.A. You want my guess, Sheck and his friends know something is coming. They know Les SaintPierre caused a leak and they\u0027re plugging up any places where it might\u0027ve come from—Julie Kearnes, Alex Blanceagle, you. If I were you, I\u0027d be worried.\" Cam looked at his beer, thought for about five seconds, then decided to laugh. \"Tha\u0027s bullshit.\" \"Ask Alex Blanceagle if it\u0027s bullshit.\" I opened my backpack and pulled out Cam\u0027s .22 Montgomery Ward. I set the gun next to me on the amp. \"You could\u0027ve killed John Crea, Cam. Not likely, but possible.\" Cam looked at the gun and his eye ticked. \"What you going on about now? What\u0027s that for?\" \"I suppose the demo tape\u0027s around here somewhere, too. You wouldn\u0027t be smart enough to trash it. You think I should give this to the police, Cam, tell them where I found it? I could tell them what idiot it\u0027s registered to and how he probably forgot to wipe the inside of the chamber for prints. They put this together with the Julie Kearnes murder, the way that was done, guess who\u0027s going to get the blame?\" Under his bruises, Cam got redfaced. He stood up real slow, holding his beer can as if he were about to throw it. \"Wait a goddamn minute—\" \"When it comes to Sheckly\u0027s helpers you\u0027re at the bottom of the food chain, Cam. I bet he didn\u0027t even pay you—I bet he just knows how to get you riled up, how to put ideas in your head of things he wants done. He\u0027s got absolutely nothing to lose, using you, and when people come knocking on his door with warrants for larger problems, you\u0027re the first sacrifice he\u0027s going to toss out. Sheckly\u0027s got you set up pretty good.\" Cam\u0027s eyes narrowed. The anger got diffused and tangled up inside him. He lowered the beer can. \"And what you think I should do, son—sit there and enjoy the knife in my back? How you think that feels? There\u0027s a time not too long ago I\u0027s in Miranda Daniels\u0027 corner pretty fierce—even after she got with Mr. SaintPierre. I used to drive her to the Paintbrush every night—nice and friendly. We\u0027d talk about the business. She and me had an understanding. I\u0027s gonna look after her? she\u0027s gonna be my ticket somewhere else besides here.\" He waved a hand around at the apartment. \"Look to you like I\u0027m getting anywhere?\" \"You figure she owes you,\" I said. \"Damn right.\" \"You figure the whole world owes you. You got an ego so big you collect your own bootlegs, Cam. Probably autograph them for yourself too. I think your perception of what Miranda promised might be a wee bit twisted.\" He took a step forward. \"You asking for something, son, you\u0027re going to get it.\" \"Knock it off, Cam. I want to get Miranda extricated from Sheckly, so her deal with Century Records can go through. You could give me the leverage I need to do that.\" Cam laughed harshly. \"Heard that before.\" \"You mean from Les?\" Cam shook his head in disgust, walked stiffly into the kitchen, pulled another beer from the refrigerator. \"Ask little Miss Daniels. Ask if I didn\u0027t tell her, first time she came crying to me about Sheck\u0027s contract on her. I figured a Century Records deal, hell, she was going to take me along for sure. We\u0027d be set. I told her somebody wanted to get a little pull with Sheck, all they had to do was look into those shows he\u0027s been taping for radio. Maybe get close to Julie Kearnes, ask Julie to pull some files here and there from the Paintbrush computers, ask her about those trips to Europe with Alex B.\" I stood very still. The only sound was the hum of Cam Compton\u0027s refrigerator and the traffic on PerrinBeitel. \"You told Miranda all this.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying.\" \"And if somebody was to dig where you said to dig—?\" Cam gave me his closelipped smile. \"Not like every sound man who\u0027s ever worked the Paintbrush doesn\u0027t know. Not like the headliner artists don\u0027t know, son. It\u0027s rankled them for years. Just nobody can prove it. I tell you, what do I get?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-27.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murder—and he may be the next to be snakebit.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}}
