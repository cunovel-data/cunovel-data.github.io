{"id":76237,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"He pushed me down!\" she yelled. \"I\u0027m not going to just stand there like you and—\"\n \"Allison—\" Miranda\u0027s voice was only slightly more in control. \"You should look at yourself, girl.\"\n I opened the door.\n They were both standing by the bed. Miranda looked like a young square dancer in her fulllength denim skirt and white blouse and bandanna around her neck. She wore no makeup, but the colour in her face looked healthier than usual because she was angry.\n Her eyes were bright brown.\n She picked a twig out of Allison\u0027s hair. She had plenty to choose from. Allison had smudges of dirt on her face and dust all down her side. Her red blouse had come untucked from her jeans. She had the same murderous look I\u0027d seen in her eyes that afternoon, but now her eyelids were swollen and red, a few tears smeared in with the dirt.\n Miranda saw me before Allison did. The singer\u0027s shoulders relaxed just slightly. She said nothing but her posture invited me in. If I\u0027d been alone in a room with Allison right then, I would\u0027ve welcomed company too.\n \"What happened?\" I asked.\n Allison started. She had a little trouble bringing me into focus. She took a shaky breath before she could answer me with something besides a scream.\n \"Sheck.\"\n \"He pushed you. So you figured you\u0027d just brain him with a horseshoe?\"\n Allison splayed her fingers and brought them up to her ears. \"He moved too fast. I swear to God the next time—\"\n Her voice broke. However violent a show she was used to staging, however much she normally got away with, this time she\u0027d surprised herself. The muscles in her face had started loosening up.\n \"There can\u0027t be any next time,\" Miranda said.\n \"You could\u0027ve succeeded in killing him, Allison,\" I said. \"Easily.\"\n Allison managed to refocus on me. \"You\u0027re the one who slammed Cam\u0027s head into a beer keg, Tres. What— it\u0027s okay for you to act that way?\"\n Miranda gave me a look I couldn\u0027t quite read. She seemed to be willing me to say something.\n I\u0027m not sure why, but just then the room we were standing in came into clearer focus. I realized it must be Miranda\u0027s. The burgundy and blue quilt on the bed, the miniature wooden horse on the desk, the dried arrangements of sage and lavender along the windowsill all seemed right for her. A tiny blond Martin guitar was propped in the corner. A few Daniels family photographs were framed in silver on the nightstand. It was a strange room—sparse and orderly but also cozy, definitely feminine. Normally I would\u0027ve guessed it belonged to a little girl with a tidy mother, or perhaps to somebody\u0027s grandmother.\n Miranda kept giving me a silent request.\n I looked at Allison. \"Why don\u0027t I drive you home? You need to get out of here.\"\n Wrong answer. Miranda tightened her lips, but she said, \"That\u0027s a good idea.\"\n Allison collected herself. She was just about to agree, I think, when Tilden Sheckly barged into the room.\n He moved like he was still groggy, but he managed a pretty hideous facsimile of his regular grin. The left side of his face was still mostly blood and dirt. His unruly graybrown hair was flattened on top by sweat in the shape of his missing hat.\n \"Allison SaintPierre,\" he croaked. \"I think we need to talk.\"\n Sheck walked toward her. I made the mistake of trying to stop him, figuring that he was still dazed.\n The next thing I knew I was sitting on the rug with my jaw feeling like it had just been branded. There was either blood in my mouth or dark beer—Guinness, maybe. I don\u0027t remember Sheckly\u0027s upper cut at all. I certainly didn\u0027t have time to block it.\n \"I\u0027ll talk to you in a minute, son,\" Sheckly said unevenly. He was focusing a little to the left of my eyes. \"We\u0027ll have some words about trespassing in people\u0027s offices. Right now, stay out of my way.\"\n He grabbed Allison by the wrist.\n Allison managed to break Sheckly\u0027s grip and rake the bad side of his face with her fingernails, but Sheck looked like he\u0027d expected that. He winced and swayed backward and then smiled, like he\u0027d just been given permission to try again with a little more force.\n \"Sheckly,\" Miranda said, soft but insistent.\n \"Miranda, darlin\u0027.\" He kept trying to get his mouth to work right, to have that normal smooth tone to it. \"This ain\u0027t your fault, honey. I know that. But you understand what your friend here did? At your Daddy\u0027s party? You think I\u0027m gonna let her walk away from that—would that be right?\"\n Allison tried for another slap and got her wrist intercepted. The back of Sheck\u0027s other hand struck her across the mouth with a sound like a leather belt snapping.\n Miranda stood frozen, staring at Sheckly\u0027s fingers around Allison\u0027s wrist. I had no luck trying to get off the floor.\n Sheck was raising his hand to strike again when Brent Daniels stepped into the doorway and cocked the hammer of his shotgun.\n Brent didn\u0027t need to say anything. Sheck knew the sound of a doubleaughtsix just fine. Sheck\u0027s hand froze next to his shoulder, like he was saying the Pledge of Allegiance. He turned around.\n When he saw it was only Brent he tried to reconstruct his smile. A little bead of blood dripped off his chin.\n \"Aw, Christ, son, put that damn thing down. You know I ain\u0027t—\"\n \"You step away,\" Brent insisted.\n Brent\u0027s voice was even and deadly serious. His eyes were still bloodshot but there was no alcoholic glaze to them. No hesitation and no uneasiness. Brent\u0027s eyes were alert and dangerous and I couldn\u0027t quite remember why I\u0027d ever thought of him as dimwitted.\n \"Brent—\" Miranda started to say, firmer than before.\n \"Shut up, Miranda.\"\n Sheckly stepped sideways, toward the foot of the bed. He wiped at his chin. \"All right, Brent. It\u0027s your house. Just appears to me—\"\n \"Get out, Mr. Sheckly.\"\n Sheck raided his hands slowly, giving up. \"All right, son. All right.\"\n He looked at Allison to let her know nothing was finished. He searched his pocket for a handkerchief and realized he didn\u0027t have one. He walked toward Brent until his chest was only a few inches from the shotgun\u0027s muzzle.\n \"Can I pass?\"\n Brent stepped aside silently. Sheckly got a glint of dazed amusement in his eyes.\n \"Maria would be proud of you, son. Taking up a gun again.\" He winked, I think. With his ruined face it was hard to tell what was intentional and what was just the flesh going into shock. \"You cut a fine figure of a man.\"\n Then, mumbling pleasantly to himself about all the people he was going to kill, Tilden Sheckly left the room.\n When he was gone the barrel of Brent\u0027s shotgun lowered to the floor. I got to my feet.\n Allison collapsed onto the bed. Her hands clenched but they trembled anyway. She gave Brent a crooked smile, winced, dabbed her tongue into the corner of her mouth, and tasted the blood there. \"My hero.\"\n Brent was blushing violently, but I don\u0027t think it was from Allison\u0027s comment. Miranda looked at him with an expression somewhere between outrage and sympathy.\n \"Oh, Brent—Good Lord, I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Shut up, Miranda,\" Brent said again. He was staring at the floor, digging a hole in the rug with the shotgun muzzle. \"For once, just shut up.\"\n 30\n I leaned against a cedar post on the Daniels\u0027 back porch, staring across the dark field toward the barn where Brent Daniels had retreated. I could only see what was illuminated by the kerosene lantern Brent had hung at the edge of the roof, and from a hundred yards away that wasn\u0027t much. The building was apparently half tractor shed, half apartment. On the side closest to me was a curtained window with no light coming through.\n The field between here and there was scarred with black lines of trenches, pocked with mounds of dirt. About thirty yards out was the dark silhouette of a backhoe. Some kind of plumbing work in progress.\n My jaw where Tilden Sheckly had hit me throbbed every time my heart beat. My lower gums were puffy, but I hadn\u0027t chipped any teeth and my tongue had stopped bleeding from the hole I\u0027d bitten into it. Compared to Sheckly—compared to a lot of people I\u0027d met this week—I counted myself lucky.\n Behind me the party sounds were dying down. The taillights of pickup trucks made little red eyes down Serra Road and onto RR22. Above my head, the bug zapper sizzled every time it said howdy to a mosquito. Once in a while somewhere out in the fields a cow or a horse farted. You think I\u0027m kidding. Stay on a ranch sometime—you\u0027ll get to know those nighttime sounds intimately.\n I\u0027d finished my last beer and was now busy shredding the plastic cup into a flower.\n Allison SaintPierre had ended up getting a ride from someone else. As it turned out there were plenty of guys ready to fight me for the chance. I didn\u0027t fight.\n I started wondering why I didn\u0027t just go around the yard, get in my car and disappear when the screen door creaked open. Miranda Daniels came out and sat next to me on the railing. She\u0027d taken off her bandanna and untucked her white shirt so it fell loose and wrinkled over her skirt. In the black light of the bug zapper her clothes glowed various shades of violet. Her lips were dark purple. The only thing that didn\u0027t change colour was her hair. It was so black I couldn\u0027t tell where it ended in the dark.\n \"Thanks for waiting,\" she said.\n \"Did you get your dad calmed down?\"\n \"I think so. He\u0027s ready for me to quit the recording project. He says it\u0027s ruining his parties.\"\n \"Not to mention his relationship with Sheckly.\"\n When she took a deep breath her collarbone sketched a line underneath her shirt.\n \"Daddy\u0027d like to see me stay a local performer awhile longer, that\u0027s a fact. He doesn\u0027t trust how fast Les has been taking things. Sheckly and him—they see eye to eye on that.\"\n \"And you? What do you want?\"\n She scraped her thumbnail along her palm like she was stroking out a splinter. \"It must look like I\u0027m just going along for the ride, don\u0027t it? Letting everybody else take turns steering. Allison\u0027s always telling me—\" She stopped, shook her head, displeased with herself for taking that detour. \"I\u0027m really not sure. I wake up different mornings, I feel different things.\"\n \"Allison showed me an article in the Recording Industry Times today. They seem to think you\u0027ll be rich enough soon to pay off your dad\u0027s ranch and buy the rest of Bulverde, too.\"\n Miranda laughed uneasily. \"They\u0027re assuming Les SaintPierre will be around to represent me.\"\n \"I spoke with Cam Compton too. He said he\u0027d told you some ways to make the Century deal happen, some ways that Les could get bargaining power against Sheck.\"\n Miranda frowned. She seemed to be casting around in her memories, trying to make a connection. Finally she found it. \"You mean about Julie. Something about the headliner shows.\"\n \"So he did tell you.\"\n \"Cam said a lot of crazy things.\"\n \"But you passed the information along to Les.\"\n Miranda shrugged. \"I don\u0027t— Maybe I did. But not seriously. I told Les it was just crazy stuff. I told him not to do anything stupid on my account.\"\n \"But he did. Les started getting close to Julie Kearnes. He started digging for dirt on Sheck.\"\n She shivered. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this.\"\n We listened to another caravan of pickup trucks rumble and ping down the gravel road. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-29.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) \n Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license.
