{"id":76227,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"Allison,\" I said.\n Miranda frowned at me. \"Pardon?\"\n \"That\u0027s an Allison SaintPierre line, isn\u0027t it?\"\n Miranda looked uncomfortable. She put the croissant down halfeaten and brushed her fingers. She stared at the .22.\n \"What about Cam Compton?\" I asked.\n Miranda took her eyes from the gun. Slowly she worked up a smile. \"Does he have it in for me? No, sir. Cam—I know you ain\u0027t going to believe this after last night, but Cam is basically harmless. You know how they say, dogs always look like their masters?\"\n \"Uhhuh.\"\n \"I\u0027m serious now. Cam\u0027s nothing but the poodle version of Tilden Sheckly. He tries awful hard to look wicked and dangerous and like he\u0027s got all this violent side ready to let loose, but comes right down to it, he wouldn\u0027t do nothing if Sheck didn\u0027t say \u0027sic \u0027em.\u0027\n Even then he wouldn\u0027t have the brains to do it right.\"\n \"You think so. Even after last night.\"\n \"I know. Cam\u0027s got himself a little music store down in S.A., bought it after he got this one hit record over in Europe somewhere, about ten years ago. Cam\u0027ll go back to that, go back to working the house band at the Paintbrush. Two weeks from now he\u0027ll forget all about Miranda Daniels. He\u0027s got nothing riding on my chances one way or the other.\"\n Sounding pleased, like she\u0027d just reconvinced herself, Miranda stretched back out on her cot and examined the ceiling. \"You know Jimmie Rodgers recorded his last ses\n sion two days before he died? The tuberculosis was eating up his lungs so bad he had to lay down in a cot in the studio between songs, just like this here. I keep thinking about that.\"\n \"Should I put the gun away?\"\n She smiled nicely. \"No, sir. It\u0027s just that Jimmie Rodgers\u0027 last sessions sound so good.\n It\u0027s depressing.\"\n \"You\u0027re not doing too badly.\"\n She didn\u0027t look encouraged.\n \"Your family supportive about your career?\" I asked. \"Your mom?\"\n She studied seven or eight ceiling tiles. \"She\u0027s dead. A long time ago. Milo didn\u0027t tell you that?\"\n I shook my head. \"Sorry.\"\n \"I* guess there\u0027s no reason he should have. I don\u0027t think about it much.\"\n She moved her lips a little more, like she still couldn\u0027t get them aligned quite right. \"But that wasn\u0027t your question again. Yes, Dad is real supportive. He\u0027s amazing, how he keeps going. You can say what you please about Tilden Sheckly, Mr. Navarre, but Sheck encouraged Dad to stay with me when we put the band together, to play at any gig he could, and that\u0027s been my biggest comfort. We got a standin bassist for him when we do bigger gigs, but still—he\u0027s an old workhorse. If it hadn\u0027t been for his music when I was growing up, all the Ernest Tubb records and the Bob Wills—that and my mother singing in the kitchen—\"\n She drifted off. I concentrated on my croissant and let her mind work around to wherever it wanted to go for a few moments.\n \"What about Brent?\"\n Miranda\u0027s eyes became clearer and cooler. \"He\u0027s supportive.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t seem happy with him last night.\"\n \"You have siblings?\"\n \"Brother and a sister. Both older.\"\n \"You get along with them all the time, Mr. Navarre?\"\n \"Point taken.\"\n She smiled dryly. \"You seem like a nice fella. You were asking last night about \u0027Billy\u0027s Senorita.\u0027 That\u0027s about the only song I wrote myself, Mr. Navarre. The others are Brent\u0027s, did you know that? \"\n I said I didn\u0027t. I tried not to look too surprised.\n \"It\u0027s funny about how they sound in the studio,\" she said at last. \"Ace was telling me—\"\n \"Ace?\"\n She did a mental rewind, then smiled. \"John Crea. My old—my exproducer. He liked to be called \u0027Ace,\u0027 what with that flight jacket and all.\"\n \"I bet he did.\"\n \"Anyway, Ace was telling me how some singers have to reproduce what makes them so good onstage in order to sound right in the session. Drugs, audiences screaming at them, what you please. Some got to turn their backs to the control booth or sing in the dark. Ace told me about this one rock and roll fella had to hang upside down to get the blood going right before he sang. I ain\u0027t kidding you. Ace said whatever I needed to make the songs sound right, he\u0027d make it happen.\"\n \"Do you know what you need?\"\n I could see her framing the right answer, her face hardening up with a level of seriousness that didn\u0027t seem natural for her. Then she looked at me and decided to discard it. She softened again and smiled. \"No. I just keep imagining myself hanging upside down in the dark with a bottle of whiskey, singing—Billy rode out last night..\n She got that far singing the line, then cracked up. \"Don\u0027t help me to sound any better, but it sure keeps things lighter in my mind.\"\n A buzzer sounded down the hall from the recording area. Miranda puffed up her cheeks and exhaled.\n \"That\u0027d be the master, calling me back. You like to stay—watch me sweat out a few more bad takes?\"\n I shook my head. \"I should pay some other visits in town before I head back to San Antonio. You didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\n She looked me in the eyes. She tried to keep the smile playful, but it was a strain for her. \"What question was that, Mr. Navarre?\"\n \"Who do you think is causing you so much grief, if not Sheckly or Cam? Anybody you know who would like to see you miss your big chance? \"\n She looked down, her hands on the edge of the cot and her shoulders bending into a U. She was short enough that she could hang her legs over the side and sweep the flats of her feet back and forth.\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to undercut Allison\u0027s invitation to our party,\" she said. \"You\u0027re welcome to come tomorrow.\"\n \"Thanks.\"\n \"Allison has been my best friend the last few months. She\u0027s been so good to me.\"\n \"You\u0027re still not answering my question.\"\n When Miranda stood, we were close enough to slow dance. I saw green flecks in her brown irises I would never have noticed otherwise. She spoke so softly I barely heard her.\n \"The funny thing is, Allison SaintPierre\u0027s about the only person who truly scares me to death. You asked and I told you. Isn\u0027t that a terrible thing to say about a friend?\"\n Milo Chavez wrapped his knuckles on the door. \"There\u0027s the champ.\"\n He moved past me and wrapped a huge arm around Miranda\u0027s shoulders. Miranda unlocked her eyes from mine and smiled up at Chavez. Her head rested on his chest.\n She let some of her tiredness show.\n \"It\u0027s going pretty rotten, Milo.\"\n \"No,\" Milo insisted. He\u0027d found his positivity. He beamed the best smile I\u0027d ever seen him beam. I was almost convinced myself, almost ready to believe our recent conversation about his missing boss and the missing funds had been a daydream.\n \"You wait, Miranda. Give it another week, you\u0027ll see. You\u0027ll be amazed. You\u0027re going to listen to yourself on the finished tape and think: \u0027Who\u0027s that star I\u0027m hearing?\u0027 \"\n Miranda tried for a smile.\n As they were walking down the hall together, Milo was rubbing Miranda\u0027s shoulders like a boxing coach and telling her how great she was doing. Miranda took one backward look at me, then returned her attention forward. The buzzer blared again, calling them inside.\n 19\n I called my information broker from the pay phone at the Whole Foods Market complex on North Lamar. One of Kelly Arguello\u0027s housemates, I think it was Georgia, answered the phone, a little breathless like she\u0027d been doing her morning aerobics. When I asked for Kelly she said, \"I\u0027m not sure if she\u0027s in. Who is this? \"\n I told her.\n \"Oh.\" Her voice went up half an octave. \"Kelly\u0027s in. Hang on.\"\n The phone smashed against something.\n I heard Kelly laughing a long time before she got the receiver. She was telling Georgia to shut up.\n Clunk. \"Tres?\"\n \"Kelly. How\u0027s school?\"\n She made a German ch sound in the back of her throat. \"Midterms. Contractual law.\n Any more questions?\"\n \"I\u0027ve got a missing person to track, need some paperwork collected on him. If you\u0027re too busy—\"\n \"Did I say that? Are you in town?\"\n I hesitated. \"Yes.\"\n \"Come over. I think I\u0027ve still got a Shiner Bock in the fridge.\"\n I stared at the roof of the parking garage at the other end of the lot. It was lined with giant papiermache groceries—strawberry, eggplant, milk. I said, \"I could just Email the information if you need to study or something.\"\n \"You know better than that.\"\n After Kelly hung up I stood there, glaring up at the huge papiermache chicken. Any resemblance to persons real or fictional was purely coincidental.\n When I was first starting my apprenticeship Erainya had two words to tell me about finding an information broker: law students. They\u0027re happy to see even small amounts of cash and they don\u0027t ask questions except occasionally \"Where\u0027s the beer?\" They\u0027re used to working like dogs, they\u0027re bright, and they know how to get the best results out of bureaucracies. All that is a lot more than you can say for most of the people who run information services.\n Unfortunately my law student helper had turned out to be a little more than I bargained for. Considering the person who referred her to me was her Uncle Ralph, I don\u0027t know why I was surprised.\n When I got to Kelly Arguello\u0027s house in the neighbourhood of Clarksville she was in front clipping back a huge mass of honeysuckle that was taking over her exterior bedroom wall and threatening to grow into her window.\n Kelly\u0027s not hard to spot. She\u0027s a girl who\u0027d catch your eye anyway, but since she\u0027s moved to Austin and put purple highlights in her hair it\u0027s doubly easy.\n \"I love this stuff,\" she said when I came up behind her. \"Unfortunately, so do the bees.\"\n \"You\u0027re allergic?\"\n Without looking away from her work she widened her eyes and nodded several times.\n \"The little guys buzzed in my window all summer long. This is the first morning it\u0027s been cool enough to do some pruning. If we keep this place for the spring semester I\u0027m going to have to trade rooms with Dee.\"\n She got her weight balanced on the ladder, then reached a little farther across the window. She was wearing a surgeon\u0027s green scrub shirt and men\u0027s white swim trunks that should\u0027ve done a good job hiding her figure but somehow didn\u0027t. She still showed off the lean, smoothly sculpted body of a teenaged swimmer. She was twenty one, barely, but no bartender in his right mind would\u0027ve failed to card her. Her purple and black hair was pulled into a ponytail that swung back and forth every time she clipped.\n \"You\u0027re going to fall,\" I said.\n \"Well, hold the ladder, stupid.\"\n I held the ladder, looking sideways so my face wasn\u0027t in Kelly\u0027s swim trunks. I concentrated on the house next door.\n \"Your neighbours are gardeners, too.\"\n Kelly made a \"sshhh\" sound, though nobody could\u0027ve heard me. The nextdoor neighbour’s front yard consisted of dirt, ragweed, an old Chevy chassis set on cinder blocks, and a brown Frigidaire leaning against an oak tree.\n \"I\u0027ve got this idea.\" Kelly stuck out the tip of her tongue as she tried to clip a vine. \"Me and Georgia and Dee are thinking about quitting law school and going into the yard appliance business. You know—selling old washing machines and refrigerators that people can set in their front yards. You drive around this side of Austin you\u0027ll see there\u0027s obviously a big demand for them. What do you think?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-19.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) \n Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license.
