Over at the picnic table with the winecoolersipping Century reps, Milo Chavez was looking confident, pleased. He\u0027d even managed to get one of the reps to crack a smile. I looked back at Sheckly. \"You wanted to level with me the other day. Let me return the favour. Samuel Barrera thinks you\u0027re as bad as your European friends. When he takes them down you\u0027re going to go down just as hard.\" Sheck raised his eyebrows placidly. \"How\u0027s that, son?\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a killer, Mr. Sheckly. I don\u0027t think Julie\u0027s and Alex\u0027s murders were your idea. I think you\u0027re a mediocre black marketeer who let things get out of control. You let some greedy professionals take over your operation and crank it into high gear. Now you\u0027re scared. You\u0027re out of your league and your local people are getting nervous. I think a year from now Jean Kraus is going to be sitting in your office, calling the shots. Either that or he\u0027s going to be long gone and you\u0027re going to be left with a very large mess where Avalon County used to be. Your friends decide Miranda\u0027s caused them any of their present troubles, you think you can really keep her out of the cross fire?\" Onstage Robert Earle and Miranda had slowed down the pace again. Keen was taking the lead on Brent\u0027s song, \"The Widower\u0027s TwoStep,\" which Robert Earle obviously knew well. It sounded strange coming from him, though, with an edge of quirky dark humour that made the tragedy in the song seem unreal. It was now just another mymommadiedandmyhounddogwent toprison country song. I didn\u0027t like the way it played. Over at the bar Sheckly\u0027s friends had recongregated with a few new recruits, all waiting and watching for some sign to come in for the kill. Sheck\u0027s face was dark. He hadn\u0027t looked at me while I spoke. He was concentrating on Miranda again, but not with any pleasure. He reached up and dabbed at the edge of the bandages on his cheek. When he finally spoke his tone was forcibly light and completely unnegotiable. \"Don\u0027t press your luck no more, son. You hear?\" It wasn\u0027t a threat. It sounded as close as Sheck could get to earnest advice. It was also very definitely the end of the conversation. As I left, Tilden Sheckly\u0027s buddies flowed back around the table. They tried their best to reconstruct the joking atmosphere they\u0027d had before—popping new beers, lighting cigarettes, talking in loud voices at my expense. Their boss smiled stonily, looking nowhere in particular, like the majority of his mind had already checked out for the evening. Robert Earle and Miranda were harmonizing onstage. Couples were slowdancing. Milo was entertaining the Nashville bigwigs with funny stories and a new round of wine coolers. I nodded amiably to the Bexar County deputy on my way inside. My birthday Budweiser was empty. One down, twentynine more to go. 47 At the break I stood outside the entrance of the bar, watching the occasional headlights go down the road. Tilden Sheckly and his friends had left long ago. About fifty other people had arrived, many of them excited when the tickettaker told them Miranda Daniels was in the house. Nobody got particularly excited to see me at the door. Nobody asked for an autograph. A few minutes after the canned music began, Miranda appeared at the entrance, followed by a cadre of smiling cowboys. She thanked them and begged off drink offers until they finally drifted away. Then she came over to me, smiled, and circled her arm through mine. Without speaking we started down the hill toward the Helotes Creek Bridge. After a hundred yards, the night closed around us. The sky was still overcast but in the south the reflection of city lights made a dull shine. We stopped at the bridge. Miranda went to the metal railing and leaned against it. I joined her. We were about eye level with the tops of the stunted mesquite trees that filled up the dry creek bed below. You couldn\u0027t see much, but you could smell the wild mint and anise, steamed into the air by the warm day. \"Milo said it sounded good,\" Miranda mused. \"It sounded great.\" Miranda didn\u0027t have to lean too far to press against me. \"He doesn\u0027t approve of you, does he?\" \"Robert Earle Keen?\" She bumped against me, playfully. \"Milo. I thought he was your friend.\" \"He\u0027s worried about your record deal. You\u0027ve got a lot on the line and Milo\u0027s afraid Sheckly\u0027s going to ruin your chances. He\u0027s unhappy I haven\u0027t found a way to get Sheckly to lay off yet.\" She ran her hand along the metal rail until it met mine. \"That\u0027s not all, is it?\" \"No. Last time Milo and I worked together—there was a woman. It took three or four years before we could speak to each other again after that. He\u0027s probably afraid I\u0027m getting distracted again, with somebody he\u0027s got a stake in.\" \"Are you?\" There was a warm, husky undercurrent in her voice. I stared into the mesquites. \"We should probably talk about that. We should probably talk about why you decided it would be useful.\" It was impossible to see her face in the darkness. I had to read her momentary silence, the sudden absence of her hand and her side against mine. \"What?\" she asked. \"You said it Friday night—it looks like you\u0027re along for the ride. Everybody worries about taking care of you because they\u0027re sure everyone else is going to mess up the job. You cultivate that kind of dependency pretty well— it\u0027s gotten you a long way.\" \"I don\u0027t ...\" Her voice faltered. It sounded compressed, still slightly playful, like she had crossed over the line in a teasing game and was just starting to realize the person yelling \"stop\" really meant it. \"I\u0027m not sure I like the way you\u0027re talking, Mr. Navarre.\" \"The funny thing is I don\u0027t blame you,\" I said. \"I want to see you make it. You\u0027ve had a pretty shitty family life up to now—you did what you could to get yourself somewhere. You figured out ways to keep your dad in check. You got Sheckly to be your standard bearer. You got your brother to sell out his songs to you. When Sheck\u0027s patronage became too confining you got Cam Compton to give you information that could shake you free, then you encouraged Les SaintPierre to try a little blackmail scheme. When things started getting scary you figured it might be useful to have me around your finger, so you gave me Friday night. Now you\u0027re getting unsure about your chances with Century Records so you\u0027re hedging your bets with Sheck again. We\u0027re all stuck on you, Miranda. Milo. Sheck. Me. Even Allison. We\u0027re all running around tackling each other and treating you like a football, and here you are quietly calling all the moves. Congratulations.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you just said that.\" I ran my hands along the metal rail. \"Tell me I\u0027m wrong, then.\" Far down the hill, a new song started up from Floore\u0027s backyard. I could decipher the bass guitar, an occasional fiddle line above it. Miranda said, \"You think that I was with you Friday night just because—\" She let her voice twist, fall silent. Everything in me said I should respond, offer an immediate retraction. I resisted. A breeze lifted up from the creek bed. It brought a fresh wave of hot anise smell with it. \"I won\u0027t let you think that,\" she insisted. She folded herself against my chest and pushed her arms under mine, wrapping fingers around my shoulder blades. \"That\u0027s not a denial,\" I said. She turned her face into my neck and sighed. I kept holding her, lightly. There were little specks of sand in my throat. I\u0027m not sure how long it was before the Danielses\u0027 white and brown pickup truck drove by us on the bridge. It slid down Old Bandera almost soundlessly, riding the brakes all the way, and doubleparked sideways in front of Floore\u0027s. I made my voice work. \"Were you expecting your brother?\" Miranda pulled away, letting her hands slide down until they hooked into mine. She looked where I was looking, saw her father fifty yards away, getting out of the passenger\u0027s side of the old Ford. The man coming around the front through the Ford\u0027s headlights wasn\u0027t Brent—it was Ben French, the drummer. The two men walked together into the bar. A premonition started twisting into a solid weight somewhere inside my rib cage. Miranda said, \"Why—\" She turned and started walking back toward the bar, trailing me behind her. Willis and Ben and Milo Chavez met us at the corner of Old Bandera, under the streetlight. Daniels looked haggard and old, not just with drinking, although he\u0027d obviously been doing that, but with anger and a kind of washedout emptiness, the dazed way people look when they\u0027re coming off a crest of grief and waiting for the next surge to hit. He leaned on his cane like he was trying to drive it into the ground. Ben French looked equally haggard. Milo\u0027s face was dark and angry. As we took a few final steps to meet them, Miranda\u0027s hand tightened on mine. \"I thought you were in Gruene tonight,\" she asked her father. \"Miranda—\" His voice cracked. \"Why are you driving the truck?\" she demanded. Willis stared at Miranda\u0027s hand in mine, confused, like he was mentally trying to separate whose fingers were whose. \"Navarre,\" Milo put in. He nodded his head back toward the bar, willing me to come with him, to leave father and daughter alone. Miranda\u0027s hand stayed fastened on mine. \"What\u0027s happened?\" Her voice was sterner than I\u0027d ever heard it, impatient. \"There\u0027s been a fire at the ranch,\" Willis managed to say. \"A fire,\" Miranda repeated. It was a whisper. Milo kept looking at me, willing me to step away. \"Where\u0027s Brent?\" Miranda demanded. But her voice was thin now, glassy. When no one answered at the count of five, Miranda tried to ask her question again, but this time her voice cracked into small shards of sound. Willis Daniels looked down at his cane, saw that he hadn\u0027t yet driven it into the ground, and wiped his nose with tired resignation. \"You\u0027d best drive with your friends,\" Willis suggested. Then he turned to go back to the truck, Ben French holding his arm. 48 The old tractor shed had cracked open like a black eggshell, ^r You could still see huge scars the fire engine had made coming through the gravel and mud, the barbedwire fence it had plowed through in order to get around the back of the house. All that was left now were three Avalon County units in the front yard, their roof lights rotating lazily, cutting red arcs across the branches of the granddaddy live oak. The medical examiner\u0027s car was pulled around the side of the house, parked diagonally over the horseshoe pit. Around the back of the house a generator whined, cranking out juice for the floodlights that illuminated the sooty wreckage of Brent\u0027s apartment. The smell of wet ashes was cloying even from twenty feet away. Miranda and her father stood on the back porch, talking to a plainclothes detective. Miranda\u0027s face was bleached and vacant. Every few seconds she would shake her head for no apparent reason. Her orange and white blouse had poofed out from her skirt on the left side and wrinkled like a balloon frozen on dry ice. I looked over what was left of Brent Daniels\u0027 front wall. Inside, the hoseddown ashes made a thick, glistening surface, almost a bowl shape. Sticking out of the sludge were lumps, objects—pieces of wood that had miraculously remained unburned right next to large pools of melted metal.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-43.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent.
