{"id":76240,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"Medina Lake,\" I repeated. \"Avalon County.\" \"That\u0027s what it says here. I\u0027m sceptical about the place in Denton but I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s still got the lake property.\" \"Why?\" \"I went by Parks and Wildlife. Les has a freshwater sailboat registered.\" I whistled. \"You\u0027re pushing for a bonus, now.\" A lot of paperchasers overlook Parks and Wildlife. I normally wouldn\u0027t have tried it myself so early in the process. Usually you start with the obvious and work your way toward the obscure. Fortunately in this case, Kelly worked differently. Her procedure was dictated more by where all the government offices in Austin fell on her bus line. \"It isn\u0027t a big boat,\" she told me. \"A twentyfive footer. He didn\u0027t need to get it registered but it looks like he did anyway.\" I thought about Les\u0027 bedroom, about the labelled shoe boxes that filled his closet, even his illegal drugs and his scams on women all neatly categorized and filed away. Maybe the bastard had been a little too organized. \"Go on.\" \"He bought the boat at Plum Cove, Medina Lake. I made some calls, got an address for the drydock space he\u0027s been renting.\" I found a pen wedged in the crack behind the ironing board/phone alcove and wrote down the information. \"Good stuff.\" \"Yeah. At least nobody else has asked about the boat.\" My pen froze above the paper. \"What do you mean?\" \"When I was at DMV, the clerk recognized the name Les SaintPierre from a few weeks ago. It\u0027s an unusual name. He commented that Les must be in a lot of trouble.\" \"Why\u0027s that?\" \"Seems I was the second person from the State Attorney that month looking through his records.\" 34 My mother was squatting in her neighbours’ back J￡\\ yard, painting faux wisteria vines on a pine fence. ^^ To get to her I had to step carefully in my dress shoes through a minefield of pie tins filled with various colours. She was wearing purple overalls and a fuchsia Night in Old San Antonio Tshirt, both speckled with acrylic. The air was warm and stagnate with fumes and Mother was sweating almost as much as the open Pecan Street Ale bottle on the steppingstone next to her. She greeted me without looking up. She swirled her brush to form a cluster of pale purple petals. There was a fingerprint the exact same colour on the side of her nose. \"You know they sell plants now,\" I said. \"You can just buy them in stores.\" Mother suppressed a giggle. I think that was my first indication maybe she\u0027d been sitting in the heat and the paint fumes too long. \"It\u0027s trompe l\u0027oeil, Jackson.\" Then she lowered her voice. \"The Endemens are paying me.\" I looked back at the Endemens\u0027 house. Mr. Endemen, a scruffy retired newspaperman, was sitting at his typewriter at the diningroom table. He was trying hard to look busy, but he kept sneaking sideways glances at us through the picture window. He was frowning, like the view hadn\u0027t improved since I\u0027d arrived. \"I won\u0027t tell,\" I promised. Mother finished her petals and looked up at me. She did a double take. \"Well ...\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I\u0027m sorry, I thought you were my son.\" \"Mother—\" \"No, you look wonderful dear. What happened to your chin?\" \"It\u0027s a bruise.\" She hesitated. She had noticed something else too— that pheromonal afterglow that only mothers and girlfriends can detect, that aura which told her I had been Up To Something the night before. Whatever conclusions she came to she kept to herself. She looked down at my ensemble while she stirred her brush through a pie tin. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d\u0027ve chosen the brown tie, but it\u0027s nice. I suppose conservative is best for an interview.\" \"A woman in purple overalls is giving me fashion tips.\" She smiled. \"I\u0027m very proud of you. Would you like to take a medicine pouch for luck?\" \"Actually I was hoping to borrow the Audi.\" Mother tightened her lips. She reached past me for her beer bottle. I stepped back so she wouldn\u0027t get paint on my black slacks. After she took a sip of Pecan Street Ale she looked up and down the fence at her work so far. \"Mr. Endemen wants grape vines along the top,\" she mused. \"I think that\u0027s too much with the wisteria, don\u0027t you?\" I thought about it. \"You get paid per plant?\" She sighed. \"Artistic question. I shouldn\u0027t have asked you. I hope you want the Audi just to drive to UTSA?\" I gave her my best innocent look. \"No ... I have some work to do afterward. It would be better if I didn\u0027t use my own car for it.\" \"Some work,\" she repeated. \"Dear, the last time you borrowed my car for some work...\" \"I know. I\u0027ll pay you back for any repairs.\" \"That\u0027s not really the point, Jackson.\" \"Can I trade cars with you or not, Mother?\" She put down her paintbrush, then wiped her hands on a rag. She pulled her key chain out of her bib pocket with two fingers. \"My hands are sticky.\" I took the key off the chain. \"Thanks.\" Mother leaned in close to the fence and traced out a new curl in her vine. Mr. Endemen kept typing in the dining room, looking out the window from time to time to see if I\u0027d gone away yet. \"So,\" Mother said, \"are you nervous?\" I refocused on her. \"About the interview?\" She nodded. \"No sweat,\" I said. \"Sitting around with a bunch of professors won\u0027t be the worst thing that\u0027s happened to me this week.\" Mother smiled knowingly. \"Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027ll do fine.\" She looked at my face again. For a minute I thought she might bring out a Kleenex, dab it on her tongue, and wipe my cheeks like she used to do when I was five. \"I hope we\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" \"You having your traditional costume party?\" I thought, after all these years, that I could keep the resentment out of my voice. I\u0027m not sure I managed. She nodded. \"It doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t make it a double celebration, Jackson.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best.\" \"You\u0027ll come,\" she insisted. When I left she was still deliberating whether or not to go with the grape vines. The neighbourhood private security guy cruised past the front yard as I was opening my mother\u0027s white Audi sedan. He saw my dress clothes and for the first time in two years he didn\u0027t slow down or look at me suspiciously. There was an Indian medicine pouch waiting for me on Mother\u0027s dashboard. 35 \"I think that went just fine,\" David Mitchell told me. \"Come in, come in.\" WJ His office was on the third floor of the Humanities \u0026c Social Sciences Building, just down the hall from the interview room. On the office door was a Peanuts cartoon of Lucy in the psychiatrist\u0027s booth with the little DOCTOR is IN sign. Professor Mitchell, a man on the cutting edge of humour. His work space was messy but cozy, filled with crammed bookshelves and dented filing cabinets and dying potted plants. There was a Macintosh computer setup as big as a Hyundai against the back wall. A poster for the Houston Renaissance Festival above that. More Lucy and Linus cartoons were Scotchtaped around the room like hastily applied BandAids. Mitchell offered me a seat and a Diet Pepsi from his private stash. I accepted the seat. \"Well,\" he said. \"Now that we\u0027ve grilled you, perhaps you have some questions of your own.\" He nodded his head encouragingly. He\u0027d done that all the way through the formal interview while his three colleagues—two elderly Anglo men and one Latino— stared at me and frowned and asked me over and over again what exactly I\u0027d been doing since my postgraduate work. When they\u0027d shaken my hand at the end of the hour they\u0027d all looked worried, like they should\u0027ve worn surgical gloves. Maybe Mother was right. Maybe the brown tie had been a bad choice. I asked Mitchell some questions. Mitchell nodded his head a lot. He had silver hair and silver sideburns that were trimmed into the shape of fins from a 1950s automobile. His features were pinched and angular and his eyes were beady like a weasel\u0027s. A nice weasel. A good ole weasel. Mitchell gave me some background on the teaching position that had opened up in the department. Apparently old Dr. Haimer, who as far as anyone could remember had been teaching medieval literature since it was titled \"Contemporary Authors,\" was finally retiring, midterm. Last week, in fact. His two teaching assistants had resigned in protest, leaving Haimer\u0027s classes in the hands of other T.A.s and a few American Lit professors who probably thought Marie de France was some kind of bicycle race. \"Medieval just isn\u0027t a very popular field,\" Mitchell told me. \"Usually we\u0027d have plenty of lecturers waiting to fill the position in an emergency, but—\" \"Why did Haimer leave?\" Mitchell shook his head. \"He opposed the establishment of more separate ethnic studies programs. Said it was fragmenting, that the curriculum should have one inclusive canon.\" \"Oops.\" Mitchell looked grave. \"He had good intentions. The fact is he said what was on a lot of our minds. But his vote was the only open dissent in the faculty senate. Word got out to the students. Boycotts started, protests on the Patillo, signs that read RACIST. Not the sort of public relations the provost wanted.\" \"So why me? You don\u0027t need another white guy.\" Mitchell stared at me like I\u0027d just made an inside joke. \"Of course. The committee would prefer someone— \u0027of diverse gender and ethnicity,\u0027 I think is the going term.\" \"But?\" He shook his head, letting a little more distaste show. \"I\u0027ll have to speak with Dr. Gutierrez about that in the committee meeting, I\u0027m sure, but let\u0027s talk about qualifi cations, son. We need someone who knows the field, someone with a good background who can relate to the students. Someone young, a teacher more than a publisher. Technically it would only be for the rest of the year—a visiting assistant professor\u0027s position—until a more extensive hiring search can be conducted. But still, once you\u0027re in, once you make connections on the faculty—\" He nodded more encouragement, letting me get the picture. I got it. We talked a little more about the interview process, about when I might come back to teach a demo class if the committee decided to go the next step. I wasn\u0027t holding my breath for that, but I said I could stay available. Mitchell nodded, content. He opened the folder I\u0027d given him and ran down my credentials and training from Berkeley. He started shaking his head and smiling. \"You\u0027re bilingual.\" \"Spanish and English. Middle English. Some classical Spanish and Latin, enough AngloNorman to get the dirty jokes in the fabliaux.\" He whistled silently and closed the folder. \"You completed a fiveyear program in three years. These letters of recommendation are extremely strong. How is it after all that you got into ...\" He looked for a polite word. \"Thug work?\" I offered. He chuckled. \"Let\u0027s go with \u0027investigations.\u0027 \" \"Just luck. And the fact that the only job I could get with my Ph.D. at the time was tending a bar on Telegraph Avenue. And the fact that a friend of mine introduced me to someone, a criminal lawyer who sort of—took me in.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-32.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murder—and he may be the next to be snakebit.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}}
