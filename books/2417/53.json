You were right all along.\" \"Big comfort.\" She turned and threw the backpack in the shotgun window. \"Besides,\" I said, \"it was twentyfive thousand.\" She frowned. \"What?\" \"The amount—I was going to give you twentyfive thousand dollars. I scammed seven hundred. You can blame me for that.\" She stared at me. I pointed my toe in the air. \"Reimbursed myself for these here boots. Paid my rent. They cost about the same amount.\" Allison cracked a smile. \"I\u0027ve seen your apartment. The boots were a better deal.\" Then she came up and put her arms around me. Her fingers traced my skin, remembering exactly where the sword tip scar was, circling around it. She kissed me long enough for Gary Hales to water the tree, the street, the front bumper on my VW. Long enough for me to forget how to breathe. Then she pushed lightly away, bumped my forehead with hers. \"Come down to Falfurrias sometime,\" she said. \"And you\u0027ll introduce me to your four brothers?\" I managed to say. She grinned. She tweaked my ear with her fingers and it stung. \"Them you could handle, sweetie.\" After the red Miata drove away I stood in the middle of Queen Anne Street until a family Land Rover drove up and tapped its horn. Excuse us. I moved to the front yard, looked at Gary Hales. \"That one\u0027s gone,\" I told him. \"Yeuh,\" Gary agreed. Disappointed. Fortunately I\u0027d paid my rent. That gave me thirty days to find either more money or more blondes. I figured the odds were about even. I went inside to see about some cake.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-53.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license. Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. The missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murder—and he may be the next to be snakebit.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}}
