{"id":76246,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"On Sam\u0027s desk were photos of Barrera with his friends—law enforcement types, the mayor, businessmen. In one photo Barrera stood next to my father. The Sheriff\u0027s \u002776\n campaign, I think. Dad was smiling. Barrera, of course, was not.\n Sam sat down behind his desk. I sat across from him in a large maroon chair that was strategically designed to be too cushy and lowset. I had the feeling of being much shorter than my host, trapped in an interrogation cup.\n \"Tell me.\" Sam leaned forward and stared and waited.\n \"Bootlegs,\" I said. \"Sheckly\u0027s been recording his head liner acts, creating master tapes in his studio, then shipping the tapes to Europe for production and distribution.\n More recently he\u0027s gotten greedier, started to import the CDs back into the U.S. That\u0027s why you and your federal friends have been stepping up the heat.\"\n Sam brushed my comments aside. \"What was in the boat?\"\n \"First I want confirmation.\"\n Sam curled his fingers. The wrath of God built up behind his eyes—a collected, intense darkness meant to warn me that I was about to be smitten from the earth. He looked around his desk, maybe for something to kill me with, and focused instead on the picture of himself and the Sheriff. Some annoyance crept into his expression.\n \"I suppose you will continue to screw things up unless I level with you, Navarre. Or unless I get someone to throw you in jail.\"\n \"Most likely.\"\n \"Goddamn your father.\"\n \"Amen.\"\n Sam readjusted his belly above his belt line. He turned his chair sideways and stared out the window.\n \"The scenario you described is commonplace. Frequently someone at a venue records the shows. Frequently the recordings turn up as bootlegs.\"\n He waited to see if I was satisfied, if I would give in now. I just smiled.\n Sam\u0027s jaw tightened. \"What is uncommon with the Indian Paintbrush situation is the scale. Mr. Sheckly is presently recording something like fifty name artists a year. The master tapes are sent through Germany to CD plants, mostly in Romania and the Czech Republic, then distributed to something like fifteen countries. More recently, as you said, his partners in Europe have been encouraging Mr. Sheckly to target the U.S. market, moving him from boots to pirates.\"\n \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\n \"Boots are auxiliary recordings, Navarre—studio practice sessions, live recordings, cuts you couldn\u0027t get in the store normally. Sheckly\u0027s radio shows, for instance. Pirates are different—they\u0027re exact copies of legitimate releases. Boots can make money, but pirate copies undercut the regular market, take the place of legitimate work. They have massive potential. You make them well, you can even pass them off to major suppliers—department stores, mall chains, you name it.\"\n \"And Sheckly\u0027s are good?\"\n Barrera opened his desk drawer and got out a CD. He took the disc from the case and pointed with his pinkie at the silver numbers etched around the hole. \"This is one of Sheckly\u0027s pirate copies. The lot numbers on the SIDs are almost correct. Even if the Customs officials knew what they were looking for, which they rarely do, they might pass this. The covers, once they\u0027re added, are fourcolor printing, quality paper stock.\n Even on the boots Sheck\u0027s taken precautions. The liner notes are stamped \u0027manufactured in the E.U.\u0027 This is meant to make one think it\u0027s a legit import, explain the difference in packaging.\"\n \"How profitable?\"\n Barrera tapped a finger on the desk. \"Let me put it this way. It\u0027s rare that you have one syndicate controlling the manufacture and distribution of so many recordings in so many countries. The only similar case I know of, the IFPI confiscated the receipts of an Italian operation. For one quarter, one artist\u0027s work, the pirates pulled in five million dollars. It\u0027d be less for country music, but still— Multiply the number of artists, four quarters a year, you get the idea.\"\n \"Business worth killing for,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the IFPI?\"\n \"International Federation of Phonographic Industries. European version of the RIAA in the States.\"\n \"Your client.\"\n Barrera hesitated. \"I never said that. You understand?\"\n \"Perfectly. Tell me about Sheckly\u0027s German friends.\"\n \"Luxembourg.\"\n \"Pardon?\"\n \"The syndicate is based in Luxembourg. Just so happens Sheckly made his connections in Bonn, does most of his business in Germany.\"\n I shook my head. \"Help me out, Barrera. Luxembourg is the little country?\"\n \"The little country known for laundering mob money, yes. The little country known for maintaining loopholes in the E.U.\u0027s copyright laws. The pirates love Luxembourg.\"\n I sat for a while and tried to process it. I was determined not to feel out of my league, not to show Barrera I was going to run from the room screaming if he gave me one more acronym.\n \"Sheckly got himself into a dangerous association,\" I said.\n Barrera came the closest I\u0027d ever seen to a laugh. It was a small noise in the back of his nose, easily mistaken for a sniff. Nothing else in his face moved.\n \"Don\u0027t start shedding tears, Navarre. Mr. Sheckly\u0027s pulling down a few million extra a year.\"\n \" But Blanceagle\u0027s murder, and Julie Kearnes\u0027—\"\n \"Sheckly may not have ordered them but I doubt he had much of a conscience attack.\n It\u0027s true, Navarre, bootlegging is usually whitecollar stuff, not very violent. But we\u0027re talking a large syndicate, into gunrunning and credit cards numbers and several other things.\"\n \"And Jean?\"\n \"Jean Kraus. He\u0027s beaten murder raps in three countries. One victim was a young French boy, about thirteen, son of Jean\u0027s girlfriend. He decided to lift some of Jean\u0027s petty cash. They found the kid in an alley in Rouen, thrown out a fifthstory hotel window.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n Barrera nodded. \"Kraus is smart. Probably too smart to get caught. He\u0027s over here encouraging Sheck\u0027s CD distribution network in the U.S. It\u0027s only a matter of time before Jean and his bosses start using Sheckly\u0027s trucking lines for their other interests—guns, especially. That\u0027s finally what got the D.A. and the Bureau and ATF interested. It takes a lot of firestoking to get them excited about stolen music.\"\n \"Your big league friends.\"\n \"We\u0027ve got a case for mail fraud in four states, interstate commerce violations—orders placed and filled with some of Sheckly\u0027s distributors. Even that has taken years to assemble, to get a judge interested enough to grant access to Sheckly\u0027s bank statements and phone records. Throw in the fact that Avalon County law enforcement is in Sheckly\u0027s pocket—it\u0027s been tough going. Ninety percent of a case like this has to be informants inside.\"\n \"Les SaintPierre. He made himself your solution.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Something his wife said. He was your in.\"\n \"To Julie Kearnes, yes. And Alex Blanceagle. And all three of them disappeared as soon as they started talking. We may lose the interest of the State Attorney\u0027s Office if we don\u0027t get more soon, something solid. Now it\u0027s your turn. What was in the boat?\"\n I took out the addresses I\u0027d found in the ice chest— locations with dates next to them.\n I handed them to Barrera.\n Barrera frowned at the paper. When he was done reading he looked out the window again and his shoulders drooped. \"All right.\"\n \"They\u0027re distribution points, aren\u0027t they? Dates when shipments of CDs will arrive.\"\n Barrera nodded without much enthusiasm.\n \"You\u0027ve got locations,\" I prompted. \"You know what Sheckly is doing. You can stage a raid.\"\n Barrera said, \"We have nothing, Navarre. We have no grounds for requesting a search warrant—no evidence linking anyone to anything, just some random addresses and dates. Maybe eventually, that information will lead us somewhere. Not immediately. I was hoping for more.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been building the case for what—six years?\" I asked.\n Barrera nodded.\n \"Chances are Sheckly knows,\" I said, \"or he\u0027s going to know soon that this information is compromised. You don\u0027t move on it now, they\u0027ll move the goods, change their routes. You\u0027ll lose them.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go another six years rather than get the case thrown out of court because we acted stupid. Thanks for the information.\"\n We sat quietly, listening to the A \u0026 M Fighting Aggie clock tick on Barrera\u0027s back wall.\n \"One more thing,\" I said. \"I think Les fled to the Danielses. Or at least he considered it.\"\n I told Barrera about the phone call from the lake cabin.\n \"He would be stupid to go there,\" Sam said.\n \"Maybe. But if I got the idea Les might\u0027ve enlisted their help, Sheckly\u0027s friends could get the same idea. I don\u0027t like that possibility.\"\n \"I\u0027ll have someone go out and talk to the family.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure that will help the Danielses much.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing else I can do, Navarre. Even under the best of circumstances, it will be several more months before we can coordinate any kind of action against Mr.\n Sheckly.\"\n \"And if more people die between now and then?\"\n Barrera tapped on the desk again. \"The chances of the Daniels family getting targeted are very slim. Sheckly has bigger problems, bigger people to worry about.\"\n \"Bigger people,\" I repeated. \"Like thirteenyearold boys who steal Jean Kraus\u0027 petty cash.\"\n Barrera exhaled. His chair creaked as he stood up. \"I\u0027m going to say what I said before, Navarre. You\u0027re into something over your head and you need to get out. You don\u0027t have to take my word for it. I\u0027ve levelled with you. Is this something an unlicensed kid with a couple of years on the street can handle?\"\n I looked again at the photo of Barrera and my father. My father, as in all his photos, seemed to grin out at me as if there was a huge private joke he wasn\u0027t sharing, almost certainly something that was humorous at my expense.\n \"Okay,\" I said.\n \"Okay you\u0027re off the case?\"\n \"Okay you\u0027ve given me a lot to think about.\"\n Barrera shook his head. \"That\u0027s not good enough.\"\n \"You want me to lie to you, Sam? You want to go ahead and arrest me? Avalon County would approve of that approach.\"\n Barrera sniffed, moved over to his window, and looked out over the city of San Antonio. It was deadly still on a Sunday morning—a rumpled gray and green blanket dotted with white boxes, laced with highways, the rolling ranch land beyond a dark bluegreen out to the horizon.\n \"You\u0027re too much like your father,\" Barrera said.\n I was about to respond, but something in the way Barrera was standing warned me not to. He was contemplating the correct thing to do. He would have to turn around soon and deal with me, decide which agency he needed to turn me over to for dissection. He would have to do that as long as I was a problem, sitting in his office, telling him what was unacceptable to hear.\n I removed the problem. I stood up and left him standing by the window. I closed the office door very quietly on my way out.\n 42\n The day heated up quickly, By eleven, when I exited the highway for WJ Ranch Road 22 in Bulverde, the clouds had burned away and the hills were starting to shimmer. I took the turn for Serra Road, then drove over the cattle guard and pulled my VW under the giant live oak in front of the Danielses\u0027 ranch house. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-38.html","bookId":2417,"book":{"id":2417,"title":"The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Widower\u0027s Two-Step (Tres Navarre #2) \n Tres Navarre has just hours of apprenticeship time to serve before he can go for his P.I. license.
