{"id":40290,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII HOW THE POSTMASTER SAW A GHOST","content":"On the day when Philip fell into the avalanche, although it was likely to break away from the face of the mountain at any moment and come thundering down on the rocks below, not a single person came to the office to watch with the postmaster, who went outside from time to time and gazed up into the mist, and then, with a sigh of relief, returned to his arm-chair before the fireplace. In better weather he would have had plenty of gossiping company, for avalanche day was quite the liveliest day in his calendar. Despite the rain which kept pattering on the low roof, he hoped that the snow and ice would hold fast to the rock until the sun came again; but nevertheless his old ears were constantly on the alert for the crash which he feared. On many a January day, in the years that were past, he had occupied his favorite chair in the warm sun against the east wall of the office, surrounded by his neighbors, watching the glittering mass, and noting the small fragments of ice which broke away from time to time before the final crash. He had heard nothing yet, and as the gloomy afternoon wore on he began to be almost certain that he was not to lose his holiday, after all. The postmaster, though living so much alone, had a way of talking to himself, and on this occasion he was more talkative than ever, because of the uneasiness he felt. \"Hit\u0027s a quare thing,\" he said, getting up and kicking the logs into a blaze, and then sitting down again in his sheepskin-cushioned chair. \"Hit\u0027s plumb quare.\" By way of making these solitary talks more sociable, the old man had developed a clever habit of talking in dialogue, imagining himself for the time in the company of some congenial spirit, for whom he spoke as well as for himself. On this particular occasion his imaginary companion was a mountain woman for whom he had felt a sentimental regard years before, but to whom he had never told his love. \"What\u0027s quare, \u0027Manuel? Why, look here, \u0027Liz\u0027beth; I\u0027ve sorted the mail here more \u0027n thirty year, watchin\u0027 the avalanches fall off yonder mounting, an\u0027 in all that time I\u0027ve never set my foot onto the top of hit. Most of us on this side hain\u0027t, \u0027Manuel; an\u0027 since the bridge rotted away an\u0027 tumbled into the gorge, there ain\u0027t no way o\u0027 gittin\u0027 thar. \u0027Liz\u0027beth, I\u0027m nat\u0027rally a venturesome man, though I never showed it to you, \u0027Liz\u0027beth, when I ought to. That\u0027s what ye didn\u0027t. I\u0027m a venturesome man; an\u0027 this here is what I\u0027ve made up my mind to, \u0027Liz\u0027beth Hough. I\u0027m detarmined to see the top o\u0027 that mounting afore I\u0027m a year older; an\u0027 I\u0027ve set the time, \u0027Liz\u0027beth—nothin\u0027 personal in that, but meanin\u0027 that when the dogwood blossoms in the spring I\u0027m goin\u0027 to find some way to git up thar. How\u0027ll ye do hit, \u0027Manuel? Hit\u0027s likely I\u0027ll fall a tree across the gorge. Don\u0027t do hit, \u0027Manuel. Why not?\" The postmaster looked wise, and put out his hand as if he were playfully touching his imaginary companion under the chin. \"Why not, \u0027Liz\u0027beth? Because folks do say that the old man that lived up thar was murdered, an\u0027 that his spirit has took the form of a harnt, an\u0027 brings bad luck to such as goes up thar to disturb him.\" The postmaster rose and kicked the fire impatiently. \"Bah! I\u0027m a bold man, \u0027Liz\u0027beth, past occasions notwithstandin\u0027. I\u0027m sot an\u0027 detarmined to do hit when the dogwood-trees blossom out, an\u0027 I\u0027m \u0027lowin\u0027 you\u0027ll come an\u0027 tend the office, \u0027Liz\u0027beth, while I\u0027m gone.\" The postmaster stood with his back to the fire, looking down over his left shoulder to where the imaginary form of Elizabeth sat. \"You\u0027ll come an\u0027 spell me, will ye, \u0027Liz\u0027beth? You allus was a \u0027commodatin\u0027 woman. No, there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 for ye to-day—not so much as a paper. Don\u0027t be in a hurry. This here idee of explorin\u0027 that mounting has took a powerful hold on me, sure. Nothin\u0027 that you can say will prevent me from so doin\u0027. Well, if you must go, \u0027Liz\u0027beth, I s\u0027pose hit\u0027s high time I was gittin\u0027 my supper. After I wash the dishes, I \u0027low to walk across to the big road an\u0027 see if there\u0027s any tracks. Good-by, \u0027Liz\u0027beth. Good-by, \u0027Manuel.\" The postmaster was silent while he raked out a bed of coals and set the three-legged iron skillet over the very hottest place. Then he mixed some Indian meal with milk and a pinch of salt, and having patted it down in the skillet, he put on the cover, and filled the rim with more coals and some burning embers. After he had buried a potato in the ashes, and set the coffee down to warm over, he broke out again: \"I couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 been mistaken about there bein\u0027 nothin\u0027 for \u0027Liz\u0027beth. I sort o\u0027 spoke at random, knowin\u0027 that the last letter she got was in \u002768, month o\u0027 May.\" Then he stepped back so as to look through the letter-boxes, which were before the south window. \"There\u0027s nothin\u0027 in H except a linch-pin, an\u0027 I \u0027low that oughter be in L—no, that\u0027s for Riley Hooper. Hello! hit\u0027s clearin\u0027. There\u0027ll be a moon to-night, an\u0027 nothin\u0027 \u0027s goin\u0027 to drap afore to-morrow.\" After he had eaten, and put away the supper-things, the postmaster took down his rifle from the rack over the door, and stepped out into the clearing. The sky was not yet free from rolling clouds, which were drifting into the east across the face of the great full moon that hung directly over the mountain. Stretching away to the seamed rock where the avalanche hung was a wide old field, broken by rocks and bristling with girdled trees, whose dead limbs wriggled upward and outward like the hundred hands of Briareus. The postmaster kept to the foot-worn trail, shuffling over the wet leaves, and glancing up now and then at the granite front of old Whiteside with great satisfaction, not only because the avalanche was safe for the night, but because he loved to think that whatever secrets the mountain held would be his when the dogwood-blossoms came in the spring. He went as far as the big road, and finding plenty of fresh tracks, he kept on in the direction of Cashiers until he came to a cabin where the bright warm light glowed through the chinks between the logs and through the cracks about the chimney as if the place were on fire. By the merry laughter he heard and the scraping of a violin he knew that a frolic was going on, and he chuckled to think that he had in his pocket a certain letter which would be a convenient excuse for dropping in on the revelers. The postmaster must have been welcome in his own social person over and above the favor of the letter he brought, for it was hard upon twelve o\u0027clock when he came out and took his way homeward, feeling jollier than he had felt for many a day, and carrying a cake in a paper parcel under his arm for the coming festivities at the office. \"Who\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought,\" he said, turning to look back at the lighted cabin, where the revelry was at its height, \"that I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 been dancin\u0027 a figger this night on the puncheons with \u0027Liz\u0027beth Hough? Hit sort o\u0027 took all the boldness out o\u0027 me when she come over an\u0027 asted me. I don\u0027t \u0027low any other human could \u0027a\u0027 cowed me that-a-way. I\u0027m a bold man under ordinary conditions prevailin\u0027 an\u0027 takin\u0027 place. I ain\u0027t easy to skeer,\" he continued as he resumed his walk, \"leastways where men is concarned.\" It was cold now, and still, and the wrinkled mud on the road was curdled with frost. The moon was well over to the west range. The last cloud had disappeared, and the stars were like jewels in the sky through the bare limbs of the trees. He was in such a rare state of exhilaration that he was more talkative than ever, and kept up a running conversation with first one neighbor and then another, until his cheerful dialogue, which had brought him to the border of his own field and in sight of the office, was rudely interrupted by the \"too-hoot\" of an owl somewhere among the girdled trees. \"Shet up,\" said the postmaster, carefully laying the cake down on the leaves, and cocking his rifle. \"Good night, Riley. Linch-pin\u0027s come; twelve cents postage stamped on the tag. Good night, \u0027Manuel. I must tend to this sassy critter, interruptin\u0027 of his betters. Where be ye, anyway? Know enough to hold yer tongue, don\u0027t ye\u0027? I\u0027ll let ye know I\u0027m a bold man, leastways—\" and with that he fired his gun at random. In the windless night the sharp report seemed to strike against the granite mountain and be thrown back like a ball of sound, to go bounding across the Cove, rolling into the distance. The postmaster reloaded his gun and eased the lock down upon a fresh cap before he took up the cake, muttering at the owl, and then chuckling to think that he had silenced his rival. He turned out of the trail to a little knoll which commanded a clear view of the granite mountain, streaked down with black storm-stains that looked like huge banners fluttering out from the shining mass of snow and ice clinging to the crest. The postmaster gazed upward for some minutes, and then moved on in silence toward the office, under the girdled trees. The avalanche was uppermost in his mind, however, and before he had gone far he stopped on another place of vantage to take a last fond look. \"Freezin\u0027 tighter an\u0027 tighter every blessed minute,\" he began. \"When the dogwood-trees blossom in the spring-time, old rock, I\u0027ll let ye know I\u0027m a bold—\" He never finished the sentence. The cake and the rifle fell to the ground, and the postmaster\u0027s jaw dropped on its hinges. Cold chills ran up his back and blew like a wind through his hair, while the blood seemed to throb in his ears. He was powerless to speak. He could only gaze with his bulging eyes at the small figure which rose slowly from the roots of the great icicles and then stood motionless and black against the snow. It looked to be a figure, so small and far away in the uncertain moonlight, and yet it stood where no living man could possibly be. His first conviction was that he saw the spirit of the old man of the mountain, who, for one reason or another, was believed to rest uneasily in his grave; and when the small object began to thresh the air with its arms like the wings of a windmill, he had no further doubt that it was the dreadful \"harnt\" of whom \u0027Liz\u0027beth had warned him. With a howl he turned and fled over the field in the direction of the office, and as he ran the owl resumed its dismal note—\"Too-hoo, too-hoot.\" As many times as he fell down he clambered upon his feet again, and ran on, never daring to look back at the \"harnt\" waving its ghostly arms above the roots of the great icicles. He thought his time had come, for he had heard that men never lived who had once seen the dead; and all the time, as he ran, the mocking cry of the owl resounded through the woods. The postmaster was staggering and breathless when he reached his door, and once inside, he shoved the wooden bolt, and leaned against the table in the center of the room. Only a few glimmering coals lighted the ashes between the iron fire-dogs. Just enough moonlight struggled through the grimy south window to show the glazed boxes, holding a paper here and an uncalled-for letter there, while the unused places were stuffed with bunches of twine, and heaps of nails, and strings of onions, and quite the dustiest litter of odds and ends filled the compartments X, Y, and Z. As the old man raised his eyes and glared around the shadowy walls, there was something which caught a fleck of moonlight high up on the chimney, but that was only the perforated cross of the churn-dasher thrust between the logs. In the north window, over opposite to the letter-boxes, his eyes fell on a wide-mouthed bottle, from whose top two dead stalks of geraniums drooped over to the shoulders of the bottle, and then spread out to right and left against the glass. With a shiver of fear, he supported himself over to his arm-chair, and sank down with his back to the object, which reminded him of the \"harnt\" flinging its arms against the snow on the mountain. The postmaster had not yet found his voice. Perhaps he feared to break the death-like stillness of the room, heavy with the sooty odor of the fireplace. For some moments he heard nothing but his own heavy breathing, and then a dull clatter, like some hard object striking on wood, came from behind the house. Instead of being startled at hearing this noise, the postmaster got upon his feet, and shuffled across the floor and out through a creaking door into a lean-to, where the moonlight poured through the loose log wall and lay in spots and stripes on the old brindle plow-steer, which was still grinding his crumpled horns against the wooden rack above his manger. \"I\u0027ve seen hit, Buck! I\u0027ve seen hit. The harnt!—the harnt!\" The postmaster\u0027s voice had come at last, and as he spoke he leaned on the shoulders of the ox, whose cold wet nose sought his groping hand. \"I hain\u0027t got long to stay. I\u0027ve seen what \u0027t ain\u0027t good to see, an\u0027 live. I hope ye\u0027ll git a good master when I\u0027m gone, Buck. Tell \u0027Liz\u0027beth that I died a-blessin\u0027 of her name, with all the boldness took clean out of me. Cut off in my sins,\" he moaned, throwing his arms about the neck of the ox, \"for seein\u0027 a harnt unbeknownst, an\u0027 hit strikin\u0027 out desperit at Jo-siah, or whoever did the murder, an\u0027 not keerin\u0027 for the avalanche no more \u0027n you keer for a hickory gad. Whoa, Buck, whoa,\" and as he spoke he patted the animal on the neck. \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to stay \u0027long o\u0027 you, Buck, this whole endurin\u0027 night. I\u0027m afeard to go back into the office.\" The postmaster trembled where he stood, and a ray of moonlight, coming through a knot-hole in the slab roof, fell full on his ashen face and glaring eyes. He spoke no more for a time, except an occasional caressing word to soothe the uneasy ox, which sidled about and grated his horns against the wooden stanchions. Then, when he grew weary in that position, he climbed over into the long manger and crouched down on the corn-shucks, where he could see the mild eyes of the ox, and the spots and stripes of moonlight on his tough hide. Gradually he grew calmer, and tried to put the gruesome sight he had seen out of his mind. \"I never knowed before ye was sech good company, Buck. You\u0027ve got eyes like a woman, an\u0027 a heap more patience. I\u0027ll never strike ye another blow, an\u0027 if I live to see to-morrow I\u0027ll write ye a letter, an\u0027 put hit in B box, expressin\u0027 my brotherly feelin\u0027s in language more fitter than I\u0027m able to do now.\" The postmaster continued to mutter caressingly to his dumb companion, until the bars and spots of moonlight began to fade, leaving the ox in obscurity, which was the time when Philip reached the upper bank and sank down on the snow, after hearing the telescope strike on the rocks in the Cove; and both men must have fallen asleep at about the same time. It was mid-forenoon when the postmaster awoke, and a man was standing over him, shaking his shoulder. The man was coming home from, the frolic at the cabin, and finding the front door bolted, had come around to the shed. He had the cake and the gun, which he had found in the field. \"What in the name o\u0027 sense are ye doin\u0027 here at this time o\u0027 day, \u0027Manuel? Come outen that manger.\" The postmaster obeyed in a dazed sort of way, and when he was on his feet he shook the straws and bits of corn-husks from his clothing, the old brindle ox looking at the two men with his mild eyes from his place in the corner. \"What made ye drap these things out in the field, \u0027Manuel?\" said the man. \"Come into the office, Jonas,\" said the postmaster, leading the way; and then he told the other of the fearful sight he had seen. The sun was warm after the rain, and soon others began to come,—men and women,—and he told his story again and again, to the awe and amazement of his simple listeners. \"I seen a quare streak down the long bank, as I came through the woods,\" said one man; \"I did sure.\" And then they all went out into the field where the gun and the cake had been found. Sure enough, there was a dull line plainly to be seen on the smooth crust of the snow. They all agreed","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1994/57058.html","bookId":667,"book":{"id":667,"title":"The Last Three Soldiers","description":"简介： If Andy Zachary, the guide, had not mysteriously disappeared from his home within the month which followed the events of the night of the 2d of July in the year 1864, sooner or later the postmaster in the Cove on one side and the people in the valley...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1994","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:08 AM"}}
