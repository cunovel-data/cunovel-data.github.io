{"id":79149,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"ONE OF THE GREEN-CLAD GUARDS escorted us to the Hall of Osca Velm, which was a Hall of welcome (most of the Halls were named after famous vampires). This was a small cavern, the walls knobbly and black with the grime and soot of decades. It was warmed and lit by a couple of open fires, the air pleasantly thick with smoke (the smoke slowly exited the cavern through natural cracks and holes in the ceiling). There were several roughly carved tables and benches where arriving vampires could rest and eat (the legs of the tables had been made from the bones of large animals). There were handwoven baskets full of shoes on the walls, which newcomers were free to pick from. You could also find out who was in attendance at the Council - a large black stone was set in one of the walls, and the name of every vampire who\u0027d arrived was etched on it. As we sat at a long wooden table, I saw a vampire climb a ladder and add our names to the list. After Harkat\u0027s, he put in brackets, \"a Little Person.\"\n There weren\u0027t many vampires in the quiet, smoky Hall - ourselves, a few more who had recently arrived, and a couple of green-uniformed guards. A vampire with long hair, wearing no shirt, came over to us with two round barrels. One of the barrels was packed to the top with loaves of hard bread, the other was half full of gristly pieces of both raw and cooked meat.\n We took as much as we wanted to eat and set it down on the table (there were no plates), using our ringers and teeth to break off chunks. The vampire returned with three large jugs, filled with human blood, wine, and water. I asked for a mug, but Gavner told me you had to drink right from the jug. It was difficult - I soaked my chin and chest with water the first time I tried - but it was more fun than drinking out of a cup.\n The bread was stale, but the vampire brought bowls of hot broth (the bowls were carved out of the skulls of various beasts), and the bread was fine if you tore a piece off and dipped it in the thick, dark broth for a few seconds. \"This is great,\" I said, munching away at my third slice.\n \"The best,\" Gavner agreed. He was already on his fifth.\n \"How come you\u0027re not having any broth?\" I asked Mr. Crepsley, who was eating his bread plain.\n \"Bat broth does not agree with me,\" he replied.\n My hand froze on its way to my mouth. The soaked piece of bread I\u0027d been holding fell to the table. \"Bat broth? \"I yelped.\n \"Of course,\" Gavner said. \"What did you think it was made of?\"\n I stared down into the dark liquid of the bowl. The light was bad in the cavern, but now that I focused, I spotted a thin, leathery wing sticking out of the broth. \"I think I\u0027m gonna be sick!\" I moaned.\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid.\" Gavner chortled. \"You loved it when you didn\u0027t know what it was. Just get it down you and pretend it\u0027s nice, fresh chicken soup - you\u0027ll eat a lot worse than bat broth before your stay in Vampire Mountain\u0027s over!\"\n I pushed the bowl away. \"Actually, I feel pretty full,\" I muttered. \"I\u0027ll leave it for now.\" I looked at Harkat, who was mopping up the last of his broth with a thick slice of bread. \"You don\u0027t mind eating bats?\" I asked.\n Harkat shrugged. \"I have no taste... buds. Food is... all the same... to me.\"\n \"You can\u0027t taste anything?\" I asked.\n \"Bat... dog... mud - no difference. I have no... sense of smell... either. That\u0027s why... no nose.\"\n \"That\u0027s something I meant to ask about,\" Gavner said. \"If you\u0027re not able to smell without a nose, how can you hear without ears?\"\n \"I have... ears,\" Harkat said. \"They\u0027re under... skin.\" He pointed to two spots on either side of his round, green eyes. (He\u0027d left his hood down.)\n Gavner leaned over the table to examine Harkat\u0027s ears. \"I see them!\" he exclaimed, and we all leaned over to gawk. Harkat didn\u0027t mind - he liked the attention. His ears looked like dry dates, barely visible beneath the gray skin.\n \"You can hear in spite of the skin stretched over them?\" Gavner asked.\n \"Quite well,\" Harkat replied. \"Not as... good as vampires. But better... than humans.\"\n \"How come you\u0027ve got ears but no nose?\" I asked.\n \"Mr. Tiny... didn\u0027t give me... nose. Never asked... why not. Maybe because... of air. Would need... another mask... for nose.\n It was strange to think that Harkat couldn\u0027t smell the musky air of the Hall or taste the bat broth. No wonder the Little People never complained when I brought them rotting, stinking animals that had been dead for ages!\n I was about to ask Harkat more about his limited senses when an ancient-looking vampire dressed in red sat down opposite Mr. Crepsley and smiled. \"I was expecting you weeks ago,\" he said. \"What took you so long?\"\n \"Seba!\" Mr. Crepsley roared, and lunged across the table to clasp the older vampire\u0027s shoulders. I was surprised - I\u0027d never seen him behave so warmly toward another person. He was beaming when he let the vampire go. \"It has been a long time, old friend.\"\n \"Too long,\" the older vampire agreed. \"I have often searched for you mentally, in the hope that you were near. When I sensed you coming, I hardly dared believe it.\"\n The older vampire ran an eye over Harkat and me. He was wrinkled and shrunken with age, but the light of a younger man burned brightly in his eyes. \"Are you going to introduce me to your friends, Larten?\" he asked.\n \"Of course,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"You know Gavner Purl.\"\n \"Gavner.\" The vampire nodded.\n \"Seba,\" Gavner replied.\n \"This is Harkat Mulds,\" Mr. Crepsley said.\n \"A Little Person,\" Seba noted. \"I have not seen one of those since Mr. Tiny visited us when I was a boy. Greetings, Harkat Mulds.\"\n \"Hello,\" Harkat replied.\n Seba blinked slowly. \"He talks?\"\n \"Wait until you hear what he has to say,\" Mr. Crepsley said somberly. Then, turning to me, he said, \"And this is Darren Shan - my assistant.\"\n \"Greetings, Darren Shan.\" Seba smiled at me. He looked at Mr. Crepsley strangely. \"You, Larten - with an assistant?\"\n \"I know.\" Mr. Crepsley coughed. \"I always said I would never take one.\"\n \"And so young,\" Seba murmured. \"The Princes will not approve.\"\n \"Most probably not,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed miserably. Then he shook off his gloom. \"Darren, Harkat - this is Seba Nile, the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. Do not let his age fool you - he is as sly, cunning, and quick as any vampire, and will get the better of those who try and best him.\"\n \"As you know from experience.\" Seba chuckled. \"Do you remember when you set out to steal half a vat of my finest wine and replace it with a lesser vintage?\"\n \"Please,\" Mr. Crepsley said, looking pained. \"I was young and foolish. There is no need to remind me.\"\n \"What happened?\" I asked, delighted by the vampire\u0027s discomfort.\n \"Tell him, Larten,\" Seba said, and Mr. Crepsley obeyed sullenly, like a child.\n \"He got to the wine first,\" he muttered. \"Emptied the vat and replaced the wine with vinegar. I had swallowed half a bottle before I realized. I spent the rest of the night retching.\"\n \"No!\" Gavner burst out laughing.\n \"I was young,\" Mr. Crepsley growled. \"I did not know better.\"\n \"But I taught you, Larten, did I not?\" Seba remarked.\n \"Yes.\" Mr. Crepsley smiled. \"Seba was my tutor. I learned most of what I know at his hands.\"\n The three vampires started talking about old times, and I sat listening. Most of what they said went right over my head - names of people and places that meant nothing to me - and after a while I sat back and gazed around the cavern, studying the flickering lights of the fires and the shapes the smoke made in the air. I only realized I was dozing off when Mr. Crepsley shook me gently and my eyes snapped open.\n \"The boy is tired,\" Seba noted.\n \"He has never made the journey before,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"He is not accustomed to such hardship.\"\n \"Come,\" Seba said, standing. \"I will find rooms for you. He is not the only one who needs to rest. We will talk more tomorrow.\"\n As the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain, Seba was in charge of the stores and living quarters. It was his job to make sure there was enough food and drink and blood for everyone, and that every vampire had a place to sleep. There were other vampires working for him, but he was the main man. Aside from the Princes, Seba was the most respected vampire in the mountain.\n Seba asked me to walk beside him as we made our way from the Hall of Osca Velm to our sleeping quarters. He pointed out various Halls as we passed, and told me their names - most of which I couldn\u0027t pronounce, never mind remember - and what they were used for.\n \"It will take a while to adjust,\" he said, seeing my dazed gaze. \"For the first few nights you may feel lost. But in time you will grow accustomed to the place.\"\n The network of tunnels connecting the Halls to the sleeping quarters was cold and damp, even with the torches, but the tiny rooms - carved out of the rocks - were bright and warm, each lit by a powerful torch. Seba asked if we wanted one big room between us, or if we\u0027d rather have separate quarters.\n \"Separate,\" Mr. Crepsley immediately replied. \"I had enough of Gavner\u0027s snoring on the trail.\"\n \"Charming!\" Gavner huffed.\n \"Harkat and me don\u0027t mind doubling up, do we?\" I said, not liking the idea of being left on my own in such a weird place.\n \"That\u0027s fine... by me,\" Harkat agreed.\n All the rooms had coffins instead of beds, but when Seba saw my gloomy face, he laughed and said I could have a hammock if I wanted. \"I will send one of my staff to you tomorrow,\" he promised. \"Tell him what you need and he will get it - I look after my guests!\"\n \"Thank you,\" I said, glad that I wouldn\u0027t have to sleep in the coffin every day.\n Seba started to leave. \"Wait.\" Mr. Crepsley called him back. \"I have something to show you.\"\n \"Oh?\" Seba smiled.\n \"Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said, \"fetch Madam Octa.\"\n When Seba Nile saw the spider, his breath caught in his throat and he gazed at it as though mesmerized. \"Oh, Larten,\" he sighed. \"What a beauty!\" He took the cage from me - holding it carefully - and opened the door.\n \"Stop!\" I hissed. \"Don\u0027t let her out - she\u0027s poisonous!\"\n Seba only smiled and reached into the cage. \"I have never met a spider I have not been able to charm,\" he said.\n \"But -\" I began.\n \"It is all right, Darren,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Seba knows what he is doing.\"\n The old vampire coaxed the spider onto his fingers and lifted her out of the cage. She squatted comfortably in the palm of his hand. Seba bent his face over her and whistled softly. The spider\u0027s legs twitched, and from her intent look, I knew he must be communicating mentally with her.\n Seba stopped whistling and Madam Octa crawled up his arm. Upon reaching his shoulder, she nestled up to his chin and relaxed. I couldn\u0027t believe it! I\u0027d always had to whistle continuously - with a flute, not my lips - and concentrate fiercely to keep her from biting me, but with Seba she was completely submissive.\n \"She is marvelous,\" Seba said, stroking her. \"You must tell me more about her when you have a chance. I thought I knew of all the spiders in existence, but this one is new to me.\"\n \"I thought you would like her.\" Mr. Crepsley beamed. \"That is why I brought her. I wish to make you a present of her.\"\n \"You would part with such a wonderful spider?\" Seba asked.\n \"For you, old friend - anything.\"\n Seba smiled at Mr. Crepsley, then looked at Madam Octa. Sighing regretfully, he shook his head. \"I must refuse,\" he said. \"I am old, and not as sprightly as I used to be. I am kept busy trying to keep up with jobs I once zipped through. I do not have the time to care for such an exotic pet.\"\n \"Are you sure?\" Mr. Crepsley asked, disappointed.\n \"I would love to take her but I cannot.\" He placed Madam Octa back in her cage and handed it to me. \"Only the young have the energy to tend to the needs of spiders of such caliber. Look after her, Darren - she is beautiful and rare.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep my eye on her,\" I promised. I once thought the spider was beautiful, too, until she bit my best friend and led to me becoming a half-vampire.\n \"Now,\" Seba said, \"I must go. You are not the only new arrivals. Until we meet again - farewell.\"\n There were no doors on the tiny rooms. Mr. Crepsley and Gavner bid us good night before heading for their coffins. Harkat and me stepped into our room and studied our two caskets.\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll fit in that,\" I said.\n \"That is... okay. I can sleep... on floor.\"\n \"In that case, see you tonight.\" I looked around the cave. \"Or will it be morning? Impossible to tell in here.\"\n I didn\u0027t like getting into the coffin but took comfort in the fact that it was for one time only. Lying back, I left the lid open and stared up at the rocky gray ceiling. I thought that with the excitement of having arrived at Vampire Mountain, it\u0027d take a long time to fall asleep, but within minutes I was out and slept just as content as I would have in my hammock back at the Cirque Du Freak. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-mountain-the-saga-of-darren-shan-4/page-13.html","bookId":2440,"book":{"id":2440,"title":"Vampire Mountain (The Saga of Darren Shan #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #4: Vampire Mountain \n On the journey are Darren Shan, two of the Little People, and Mr. Crepsley; they also run into Mr. Crepsley\u0027s old friend, Gavner Purl in a way station.
