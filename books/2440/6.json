{"id":79142,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"THE WOLF STUDIED ME SILENTLY, its nose crinkling over its jagged canines as it sniffed my scent. I gently laid my canteen down, not sure what to do. If I called for help, the wolf might panic and flee - then again, it might attack. If I stayed like I was, it might lose interest and slink away - or it might take it as a sign of weakness and move in for the kill.\\n\\n I was desperately trying to decide when the wolf tensed its hind legs, lowered its head, and pounced, crossing the stream with one giant bound. It crashed into my chest, knocking me to the ground. I tried scrambling away but the wolf had perched on top of me and was too heavy to throw off. My hands searched frantically for a rock or stick, something to beat the animal with, but there was nothing to grab except snow.\\n\\n The wolf was a terrifying sight up close, with its dark gray face and slanting yellow eyes, its black muzzle and bared white teeth, some two or three inches long. Its tongue lolled out the side of its mouth and it was panting slowly. Its breath stank of blood and raw animal flesh.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know anything about wolves - except that vampires couldn\u0027t drink from them - so I didn\u0027t know how to react: Attack its face or go for its body? Lie still and hope it went away, or shout and maybe scare it off? While my brain was spinning, the wolf lowered its head, extended its long wet tongue, and... licked me!\\n\\n I was so stunned, I just lay there, staring up at the jaws of the fearsome animal. The wolf licked me again, then got off, faced the stream, went down on its paws, and lapped at the water. I lay where I was a few moments more, then pulled myself up and sat watching it drink, noting that it was a male.\\n\\n When the wolf had drunk enough, he stood, lifted his head, and howled. From the trees on the opposite side of the stream, three more wolves emerged and crept down to the bank, where they drank. Two were females and one was a young cub, darker and smaller than the others.\\n\\n The male watched the others drinking, then sat beside me. He snuggled up to me like a dog, and, before I knew what I was doing, I\u0027d reached around and was tickling him behind his ear. The wolf whined happily and cocked his head so I could scratch behind the other ear.\\n\\n One of the she-wolves finished drinking and jumped the stream. She sniffed my feet, then sat on the other side of me and offered her head to be scratched. The male growled at her jealousy but she took no notice.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t long before the other two joined the couple on my side of the stream. The female was shier than her friends and hovered a couple of feet away. The cub wasn\u0027t scared and crawled over my legs and belly, sniffing like a hound dog. He cocked a leg to mark my left thigh, but before he could, the male wolf snapped at him and sent him tumbling. He barked angrily, then slunk back and climbed over me again. This time he didn\u0027t try to mark his territory - thankfully!\\n\\n I sat there for a long time playing with the cub and tickling the bigger pair of wolves. The male rolled over onto his back, so that I could rub his belly. His hair was lighter underneath, except for a long streak of black hair that ran partway up his middle. ?Streak\" seemed like a good name for a wolf, so that\u0027s what I called him.\\n\\n I wanted to see if they knew any tricks, so I found a stick and threw it. \"Fetch, Streak, fetch!\" I shouted, but he didn\u0027t budge. I tried getting him to sit at attention. \"Sit, Streak!\" I ordered. He stared at me. \"Sit - like this.\" I squatted on my butt. Streak moved back a little, as though he thought I might be crazy. The cub was really playful and jumped on me. I laughed and stopped trying to teach them tricks.\\n\\n After that I headed back to camp to tell the vampires about my new friends. The wolves followed, although only Streak walked by my side - the others trailed behind.\\n\\n Mr. Crepsley and Gavner were asleep when I got back, tucked underneath thick deer blankets. Gavner was snoring loudly. With only their heads showing, they looked like the ugliest pair of babies in the world! I wished I had a camera that could photograph vampires, so that I could take their picture.\\n\\n I was about to get underneath the blankets when I had an idea. The wolves had stopped at the trees. I coaxed them in. Streak came first and examined the base, making sure it was safe. When he was satisfied, he growled lightly and the other wolves entered, keeping away from the sleeping vampires.\\n\\n I lay down on the far side of the fire and held a blanket up, inviting the wolves to lie down with me. They wouldn\u0027t go underneath the blanket - the cub tried, but its mother jerked it back by the scruff of its neck - but once I lay down and covered myself with it, they crept up and lay on top, even the shy she-wolf. They were heavy, and the scent of their hairy bodies was overbearing, but the warmth of the wolves was heavenly, and despite the fact that I was resting so close to the cave where a vampire had been killed recently, I slept in complete comfort.\\n\\n I was awakened by angry growls. Jolting upright, I found the three adult wolves spread in a semicircle in front of my bed, the male in the middle. The cub was cowering behind me. Ahead stood the Little People. Their gray hands were flexing by their sides and they were moving in on the wolves.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" I screamed, leaping to my feet. On the other side of the fire - which had died out while I was sleeping - Mr. Crepsley and Gavner snapped awake and rolled out from under their blankets. I jumped in front of Streak and snarled at the Little People. They stared at me from underneath their blue hoods. I stared at the large green eyes of the one closest me.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening?\" Gavner shouted, blinking rapidly.\\n\\n The nearest Little Person ignored Gavner, pointed at the wolves, then at his belly, and rubbed it. That was the sign that he was hungry. I shook my head. \"Not the wolves,\" I told him. \"They\u0027re my friends.\" He made the rubbing motion again. \"No!\" I shouted.\\n\\n The Little Person began to advance, but the one behind him - Lefty - reached out and touched his arm. The Little Person locked gazes with Lefty, stood still for a second, then shuffled away to where he\u0027d left the rats they had caught while hunting. Lefty lingered a second, his hidden green eyes on mine, before joining his brother (I always thought of them as brothers).\\n\\n \"I see you have met some of our cousins,\" Mr. Crepsley said, stepping slowly over the remains of the fire, holding his hands palms-up so the wolves wouldn\u0027t be alarmed. They growled at him, but once they caught his scent they relaxed and sat, although they kept a wary eye on the munching Little People.\\n\\n \"Cousins?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Wolves and vampires are related,\" he explained. \"Legends claim that once we were the same, just as man and ape were originally one. Some of us learned to walk on two legs and became vampires - the others remained wolves.\"\\n\\n \"Is that true?\" I asked.\\n\\n Mr. Crepsley shrugged. \"Where legends are concerned, who knows?\" He crouched in front of Streak and studied him silently. Streak sat up straight and ruffled his head to make his ears and mane erect. \"A fine specimen,\" Mr. Crepsley said, stroking the wolf\u0027s long snout. \"A born leader.\"\\n\\n \"I call him Streak, because he\u0027s got a streak of black hair on his belly,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Wolves have no need of names,\" the vampire informed me. \"They are not dogs.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a spoilsport,\" Gavner said, stepping up beside his friend. \"Let him give them names if he wants. It can\u0027t do any harm.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. He held out a hand to the she-wolves and they stepped forward to lick his palm, including the shy one. \"I always had a way with wolves,\" he said, unable to keep the pride out of his voice.\\n\\n \"How come they\u0027re so friendly?\" I asked. \"I thought wolves shied away from people.\"\\n\\n \"From humans,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"Vampires are different. Our scent is similar to their own. They recognize us as kindred spirits. Not all wolves are friendly - these must have had dealings with our kind before - but none would ever attack a vampire, not unless they were starving.\"\\n\\n \"Did you see any more of them?\" Gavner asked. I shook my head. \"Then they\u0027re probably journeying toward Vampire Mountain to join up with other packs.\"\\n\\n \"Why would they be going to Vampire Mountain?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Wolves come whenever there\u0027s a Council,\" he explained. \"They know from experience that there will be plenty of scraps for them to feed on. The guardians of Vampire Mountain spend years stocking up for Councils. There\u0027s always food left over, which they dump outside for the creatures of the wild to dispose of.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a long way to go for a few scraps,\" I commented.\\n\\n \"They go for more than food,\" Mr. Crepsley said. \"They gather for company, to salute old friends, find new mates, and share memories.\"\\n\\n \"Wolves can communicate?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"They are able to transmit simple thoughts to one another. They do not actually talk - wolves have no words - but can share pictures and pass on maps of where they have been, letting others know where hunting is plentiful or scarce.\"\\n\\n \"Speaking of which, we\u0027d better make ourselves scarce,\" Gavner said. \"The sun\u0027s going down and it\u0027s time we got a move on. You chose a long, roundabout route to come by, Larten, and if we don\u0027t pick up the pace, we\u0027ll arrive late for the Council.\"\\n\\n \"There are other paths?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he said. \"There are dozens of ways. That\u0027s why - except for the remains of the dead one - we haven\u0027t run into other vampires - each comes by a different route.\"\\n\\n We rolled up our blankets and departed, Mr. Crepsley and Gavner keeping a close eye on the trail, scouring it for signs of whoever had killed the vampire in the cave. The wolves followed us through the trees and ran beside us for a couple of hours, keeping clear of the Little People, before vanishing ahead of us into the night.\\n\\n \"Where are they going?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"To hunt,\" Mr. Crepsley replied.\\n\\n \"Will they come back?\"\\n\\n \"It would not surprise me,\" he said, and, come dawn, as we were making camp, the four wolves reappeared like ghosts out of the snow and made their beds beside and on top of us. For the second day running, I slept soundly, disturbed only by the cold nose of the cub when he snuck in under the blanket during the middle of the day to cuddle up beside me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-mountain-the-saga-of-darren-shan-4/page-6.html","bookId":2440,"book":{"id":2440,"title":"Vampire Mountain (The Saga of Darren Shan #4)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #4: Vampire Mountain \\n On the journey are Darren Shan, two of the Little People, and Mr. Crepsley; they also run into Mr. Crepsley\u0027s old friend, Gavner Purl in a way station.
