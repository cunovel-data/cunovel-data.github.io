{"id":79147,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"MR. CREPSLEY AND GAVNER wouldn\u0027t explain the meaning of Harkat\u0027s message right away - they were too stunned to speak - and the story only trickled out over the next three or four nights, most of it coming from Gavner Purl.\\n\\n It had to do with something Mr. Tiny told the vampires hundreds of years ago, when the vampaneze broke away. Once the fighting had died down, he visited the Princes at Vampire Mountain and told them that the vampaneze were not \"hierarchically structured\" (Mr. Crepsley\u0027s phrase), which meant there were no Vampaneze Generals or Princes. Nobody gave orders or bossed the others around.\\n\\n \"That was one of the reasons they broke away,\" Gavner said. \"They didn\u0027t like the way things worked with vampires. They thought it was unfair that ordinary vampires had to answer to the Generals, and the Generals to the Princes.\"\\n\\n Lowering his voice so that Mr. Crepsley couldn\u0027t hear, he said, \"To be honest, I agree with some of that. There is room for change. The vampire system has worked for hundreds of years, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Are you saying you\u0027d rather be a vampaneze?\" I asked, shocked.\\n\\n \"Of course not!\" He laughed. \"They kill, and allow mad vampaneze like Murlough to run around and do as they please. It\u0027s far better to be a vampire. But that doesn\u0027t mean that some of their ideas aren\u0027t worth taking on board.\\n\\n \"Not flitting on the way to Vampire Mountain, for example - that\u0027s a ridiculous rule, but it can only be changed by the Princes, who don\u0027t have to change anything they don\u0027t want to, regardless of what the rest of us think. Generals have to do everything the Princes say, and ordinary vampires have to do everything Generals say.\"\\n\\n Though the vampaneze didn\u0027t believe in leaders, Mr. Tiny said that one night a champion would step forward. He would be known as the Vampaneze Lord and the vampaneze would follow him blindly and do everything he said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so bad about that?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Wait till you hear the next part,\" Gavner said gravely. Apparently, not long after the Vampaneze Lord came to power, he would lead the vampaneze into war against the vampires. It was a war, Mr. Tiny warned, that the vampires couldn\u0027t win. They would be wiped out.\\n\\n \"Is that true?\" I asked, appalled.\\n\\n Gavner shrugged. \"We\u0027ve been asking ourselves that for seven hundred years. Nobody doubts Mr. Tiny\u0027s powers - he\u0027s proved before that he can see into the future - but sometimes he tells lies. He\u0027s an evil little worm.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you go after the vampaneze and kill them all?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Mr. Tiny said that some vampaneze would survive and the Vampaneze Lord would come as promised. Besides, war with the vampaneze was exacting too heavy a toll. Humans were hunting us down and might have made an end of us. It was best to declare a truce and let matters lie.\"\\n\\n \"Is there no way the vampires could beat the vampaneze?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Gavner replied scratching his head. \"There are more vampires than vampaneze and we\u0027re as strong as they are, so I can\u0027t see why we shouldn\u0027t be able to get the better of them. But Mr. Tiny said numbers wouldn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s one hope,\" he added. \"The Stone of Blood.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll see when we get to Vampire Mountain. It\u0027s a magic icon, sacred to us. Mr. Tiny said that if we prevented it from falling into the hands of the vampaneze, one night, long after the battle has been fought and lost, there\u0027s a chance that vampires might rise from the ashes and prosper again.\"\\n\\n \"How?\" I asked, frowning.\\n\\n Gavner smiled. \"That question has puzzled vampires for as long as it\u0027s been asked. Let me know if you figure it out,\" he said with a wink, and drew the conversation to a troubling close.\\n\\n A week later, we arrived at Vampire Mountain.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t the highest mountain in the region, but it was steep and rocky, and looked like it would be almost impossible to climb. \"Where\u0027s the palace?\" I asked, squinting up at the snowy peak, which seemed to point directly at the three-quarter moon overhead.\\n\\n \"Palace?\" Mr. Crepsley replied.\\n\\n \"Where the Vampire Princes live.\" Mr. Crepsley and Gavner burst out laughing. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" I snapped.\\n\\n \"How long do you think we would escape detection if we built a palace on the side of a mountain?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.\\n\\n \"Then where...?\" Understanding dawned. \"It\u0027s inside the mountain!\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Gavner smiled. \"The mountain\u0027s a giant hive of caves and chambers. Everything a vampire could wish for is stored within - coffins, vats of human blood, food, and wine. The only time you see vampires on the outside is when they\u0027re arriving or departing or going to hunt.\"\\n\\n \"How do we get in?\" I asked.\\n\\n Mr. Crepsley tapped the side of his nose. \"Watch and see.\"\\n\\n We walked around the rocky base of the mountain. Mr. Crepsley and Gavner were full of excitement, though only Gavner let it show - the older vampire acted as dryly as ever, and it was only when he thought nobody was looking that he\u0027d grin to himself and rub his hands together in anticipation.\\n\\n We reached a stream that was about twenty feet wide. The water flowed swiftly through it and gushed away down to the flat plains beyond. While we were working our way upstream, a lone wolf appeared in the near distance and howled. Streak and the other wolves came to an immediate stop. Streak\u0027s ears pricked up; he listened a moment, then howled back. His tail was wagging when he looked at me.\\n\\n \"He is saying good-bye,\" Mr. Crepsley informed me, but I\u0027d guessed that already.\\n\\n \"Do they have to go?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"This is what they came for - to meet others of their kind. It would be cruel to ask them to stay with us.\"\\n\\n I nodded glumly and reached down to scratch Streak\u0027s ears. \"Nice knowing you, Streak,\" I said. Then I patted Rudi. \"I\u0027ll miss you, you miserable little runt.\"\\n\\n The adult wolves started to walk away. Rudi hesitated, looking from me to the departing wolves. For a second I thought he might choose to stick with me, but then he barked, rubbed his wet nose over the tops of my bare feet, and ran off after the others.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll see him again,\" Gavner promised. \"We\u0027ll look them up when we leave.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\" I sniffed, pretending I wasn\u0027t bothered. \"I\u0027ll be okay. They\u0027re just a pack of dumb old wolves. I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n \"Of course you don\u0027t.\" Gavner smiled.\\n\\n \"Come,\" Mr. Crepsley said, heading upstream. \"We cannot stand here all night, pining over a few mangy wolves.\" I glared at him, and he coughed uncomfortably. \"You know,\" he added softly, \"wolves never forget a face. The cub will remember you even when it is old and gray.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, then turned and resumed walking. Gavner and Harkat fell in behind him. I looked over my shoulder one last time at the departing wolves, sighed dejectedly, then I picked up my bag and followed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-mountain-the-saga-of-darren-shan-4/page-11.html","bookId":2440,"book":{"id":2440,"title":"Vampire Mountain (The Saga of Darren Shan #4)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #4: Vampire Mountain \\n On the journey are Darren Shan, two of the Little People, and Mr. Crepsley; they also run into Mr. Crepsley\u0027s old friend, Gavner Purl in a way station.
