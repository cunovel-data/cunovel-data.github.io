Some thought that the sun looked larger than it looked from Narnia, but others disagreed. And they sailed and sailed before a gentle yet steady breeze and saw neither fish nor gull- nor ship nor shore. And stores began to get low again, and it crept into their hearts that perhaps they might have come to a sea which went on for ever. But when the very last day on which they thought they could risk continuing their eastward voyage dawned, it showed, right ahead between them and the sunrise, a low land lying like a cloud.\\n\\n They made harbour in a wide bay about the middle of the afternoon and landed. It was a very different country from any they had yet seen. For when they had crossed the sandy beach they found all silent and empty as if it were an uninhabited land, but before them there were level lawns in which the grass was as smooth and short as it used to be in the grounds of a great English house where ten gardeners were kept. The trees, of which there were many, all stood well apart from one another, and there were no broken branches and no leaves lying on the ground. Pigeons sometimes cooed but there was no other noise.\\n\\n Presently they came to a long, straight, sanded path with not a weed growing on it and trees on either hand. Far off at the other end of this avenue they now caught sight of a house - very long and grey and quiet-looking in the afternoon sun.\\n\\n Almost as soon as they entered this path Lucy noticed that she had a little stone in her shoe. In that unknown place it might have been wiser for her to ask the others to wait while she took it out. But she didn\u0027t; she just dropped quietly behind and sat down to take off her shoe. Her lace had got into a knot.\\n\\n Before she had undone the knot the others were a fair distance ahead. By the time she had got the stone out and was putting the shoe on again she could no longer hear them. But almost at once she heard something else. It was not coming from the direction of the house.\\n\\n What she heard was a thumping. It sounded as if dozens of strong workmen were hitting the ground as hard as they could with great wooden mallets. And it was very quickly coming nearer. She was already sitting with her back to a tree, and as the tree was not one she could climb, there was really nothing to do but to sit dead still and press herself against the tree and hope she wouldn\u0027t be seen.\\n\\n Thump, thump, thump . . . and whatever it was must be very close now for she could feel the ground shaking. But she could see nothing. She thought the thing - or things must be just behind her. But then there came a thump on the path right in front of her. She knew it was on the path not only by the sound but because she saw the sand scatter as if it had been struck a heavy blow. But she could see nothing that had struck it. Then all the thumping noises drew together about twenty feet away from her and suddenly ceased. Then came the Voice.\\n\\n It was really very dreadful because she could still see nobody at all. The whole of that park-like country still looked as quiet and empty as it had looked when they first landed. Nevertheless, only a few feet away from her, a voice spoke. And what it said was:\\n\\n \"Mates, now\u0027s our chance.\"\\n\\n Instantly a whole chorus of other voices replied, \"Hear him. Hear him. `Now \u0027s our chance\u0027, he said. Well done, Chief. You never said a truer word.\"\\n\\n \"What I say,\" continued the first voice, \"is, get down to the shore between them and their boat, and let every mother\u0027s son look to his weapons. Catch \u0027em when they try to put to sea.\"\\n\\n \"Eh, that\u0027s the way,\" shouted all the other voices. \"You never made a better plan, Chief. Keep it up, Chief. You couldn\u0027t have a better plan than that.\"\\n\\n \"Lively, then, mates, lively,\" said the first voice. \"Off we go.\\n\\n \"Right again, Chief,\" said the others. \"Couldn\u0027t have a better order. Just what we were going to say ourselves. Off we go.\"\\n\\n Immediately the thumping began again - very loud at first but soon fainter and fainter, till it died out in the direction of the sea.\\n\\n Lucy knew there was no time to sit puzzling as to what these invisible creatures might be. As soon as the thumping noise had died away she got up and ran along the path after the others as quickly as her legs would carry her. They must at all costs be warned.\\n\\n While this had been happening the others had reached the house. It was a low building - only two stories high made of a beautiful mellow stone, many-windowed, and partially covered with ivy. Everything was so still that Eustace said, \"I think it\u0027s empty,\" but Caspian silently pointed to the column of smoke which rose from one chimney.\\n\\n They found a wide gateway open and passed through it into a paved courtyard. And it was here that they had their first indication that there was something odd about this island. In the middle of the courtyard stood a pump, and beneath the pump a bucket. There was nothing odd about that. But the pump handle was moving up and down, though there seemed to be no one moving it.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s some magic at work here,\" said Caspian.\\n\\n \"Machinery!\" said Eustace. \"I do believe we\u0027ve come to a civilized country at last.\"\\n\\n At that moment Lucy, hot and breathless, rushed into the courtyard behind them. In a low voice she tried to make them understand what she had overheard. And when they had partly understood it even the bravest of them did not look very happy.\\n\\n \"Invisible enemies,\" muttered Caspian. \"And cutting us off from the boat. This is an ugly furrow to plough.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no idea what sort of creatures they are, Lu?\" asked Edmund.\\n\\n \"How can I, Ed, when I couldn\u0027t see them?\"\\n\\n \"Did they sound like humans from their footsteps?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hear any noise of feet - only voices and this frightful thudding and thumping - like a mallet.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder,\" said Reepicheep, \"do they become visible when you drive a sword into them?\"\\n\\n \"It looks as if we shall find out,\" said Caspian. \"But let\u0027s get out of this gateway. There\u0027s one of these gentry at that pump listening to all we say.\"\\n\\n They came out and went back on to the path where the trees might possibly make them less conspicuous. \"Not that it\u0027s any good really,\" said Eustace, \"trying to hide from people you can\u0027t see. They may be all round us.\"\\n\\n \"Now, Drinian,\" said Caspian. \"How would it be if we gave up the boat for lost, went down to another part of the bay, and signalled to the Dawn Treader to stand in and take us aboard?\"\\n\\n \"Not depth for her, Sire,\" said Drinian.\\n\\n \"We could swim,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n \"Your Majesties all,\" said Reepicheep, \"hear me. It is folly to think of avoiding an invisible enemy by any amount of creeping and skulking. If these creatures mean to bring us to battle, be sure they will succeed. And whatever comes of it I\u0027d sooner meet them face to face than be caught by the tail.\"\\n\\n \"I really think Reep is in the right this time,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n \"Surely,\" said Lucy, \"if Rhince and the others on the Dawn Treader see us fighting on the shore they\u0027ll be able to do something.\"\\n\\n \"But they won\u0027t see us fighting if they can\u0027t see any enemy,\" said Eustace miserably. \"They\u0027ll think we\u0027re just swinging our swords in the air for fun.\"\\n\\n There was an uncomfortable pause.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Caspian at last, \"let\u0027s get on with it. We must go and face them. Shake hands all round - arrow on the string, Lucy - swords out, everyone else - and now for it. Perhaps they\u0027ll parley.\"\\n\\n It was strange to see the lawns and the great trees looking so peaceful as they marched back to the beach. And when they arrived there, and saw the boat lying where they had left her, and the smooth sand with no one to be seen on it, more than one doubted whether Lucy had not merely imagined all she had told them. But before they reached the sand, a voice spoke out of the air.\\n\\n \"No further, masters, no further now,\" it said. \"We\u0027ve got to talk with you first. There\u0027s fifty of us and more here with weapons in our fists.\"\\n\\n \"Hear him, hear him,\" came the chorus. \"That\u0027s our Chief. You can depend on what he says. He\u0027s telling you the truth, he is.\"\\n\\n \"I do not see these fifty warriors,\" observed Reepicheep.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right,\" said the Chief Voice. \"You don\u0027t see us. And why not? Because we\u0027re invisible.\"\\n\\n \"Keep it up, Chief, keep it up,\" said the Other Voices. \"You\u0027re talking like a book. They couldn\u0027t ask for a better answer than that.\"\\n\\n \"Be quiet, Reep,\" said Caspian, and then added in a louder voice, \"You invisible people, what do you want with us? And what have we done to earn your enmity?\"\\n\\n \"We want something that little girl can do for us,\" said the Chief Voice. (The others explained that this was just what they would have said themselves.)\\n\\n \"Little girl!\" said Reepicheep. \"The lady is a queen.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know about queens,\" said the Chief Voice.\\n\\n (\"No more we do, no more we do,\" chimed in the others.) \"But we want something she can do.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n \"And if it is anything against her Majesty\u0027s honour or safety,\" added Reepicheep, \"you will wonder to see how many we can kill before we die.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said the Chief Voice. \"It\u0027s a long story. Suppose we all sit down?\" ,\\n\\n The proposal was warmly approved by the other voices but the Narnians remained standing.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said the Chief Voice. \"It\u0027s like this. This island has been the property of a great magician time out of mind. And we all are - or perhaps in a manner of speaking, I might say, we were - his servants. Well, to cut a long story short, this magician that I was speaking about, he told us to do something we didn\u0027t like. And why not? Because we didn\u0027t want to. Well, then, this same magician he fell into a great rage; for I ought to tell you he owned the island and he wasn\u0027t used to being crossed. He was terribly downright, you know. But let me see, where am I? Oh yes, this magician then, he goes upstairs (for you must know he kept all his magic things up there and we all lived down below), I say he goes upstairs and puts a spell on us. An uglifying spell. If you saw us now, which in my opinion you may thank your stars you can\u0027t, you wouldn\u0027t believe what we looked like before we were uglified. You wouldn\u0027t really. So there we all were so ugly we couldn\u0027t bear to look at one another. So then what did we do? Well, I\u0027ll tell you what we did. We waited till we thought this same magician would be asleep in the afternoon and we creep upstairs and go to his magic book, as bold as brass, to see if we can do anything about this uglification. But we were all of a sweat and a tremble, so I won\u0027t deceive you. But, believe me or believe me not, I do assure you that we couldn\u0027t find any thing in the way of a spell for taking off the ugliness. And what with time getting on and being afraid that the old gentleman might wake up any minute - I was all of a muck sweat, so I won\u0027t deceive you - well, to cut a long story short, whether we did right or whether we did wrong, in the end we see a spell for making people invisible. And we thought we\u0027d rather be invisible than go on being as ugly as all that. And why? Because we\u0027d like it better. So my little girl, who\u0027s just about your little girl\u0027s age, and a sweet child she was before she was uglified, though now - but least said soonest mended - I say, my little girl she says the spell, for it\u0027s got to be a little girl or else the magician himself, if you see my meaning, for otherwise it won\u0027t work. And why not? Because nothing happens. So my Clipsie says the spell, for I ought to have told you she reads beautifully, and there we all were as invisible as you could wish to see. And I do assure you it was a relief not to see one another\u0027s faces. At first, anyway. But the long and the short of it is we\u0027re mortal tired of being invisible. And there\u0027s another thing. We never reckoned on this magician (the one I was telling you about before) going invisible too. But we haven\u0027t ever seen him since. So we don\u0027t know if he\u0027s dead, or gone .away, or whether he\u0027s just sitting upstairs being invisible, and perhaps coming down and being invisible there. And, believe me, it\u0027s no manner of use listening because he always did go about with his bare feet on, making no more noise than a great big cat. And I\u0027ll tell all you gentlemen straight, it\u0027s getting more than what our nerves can stand.\"\\n\\n Such was the Chief Voice\u0027s story, but very much shortened, because I have left out what the Other Voices said. Actually he never got out more than six or seven words without being interrupted by their agreements and encouragements, which drove the Narnians nearly out of their minds with impatience. When it was over there was a very long silence.\\n\\n \"But,\" said Lucy at last, \"what\u0027s all this got to do with us? I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"Why, bless me, if I haven\u0027t gone and left out the whole point,\" said the Chief Voice.\\n\\n \"That you have, that you have,\" roared the Other Voices with great enthusiasm. \"No one couldn\u0027t have left it out cleaner and better. Keep it up, Chief, keep it up.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I needn\u0027t go over the whole story again,\" began the Chief Voice.\\n\\n \"No. Certainly not,\" said Caspian and Edmund.\\n\\n \"Well, then, to put it in a nutshell,\" said the Chief Voice, \"we\u0027ve been waiting for ever so long for a nice little girl from foreign parts, like it might be you, Missie - that would go upstairs and go to the magic book and find the spell that takes off the invisibleness, and say it. And we all swore that the first strangers as landed on this island (having a nice little girl with them, I mean, for if they hadn\u0027t it\u0027d be another matter) we wouldn\u0027t let them go away alive unless they\u0027d done the needful for us. And that\u0027s why, gentlemen, if your little girl doesn\u0027t come up to scratch, it will be our painful duty to cut all your throats. Merely in the way of business, as you might say, and no offence, I hope.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see all your weapons,\" said Reepicheep. \"Are they invisible too?\" The words were scarcely out of his mouth before they heard a whizzing sound and next moment a spear had stuck, quivering, in one of the trees behind them.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a spear, that is,\" said the Chief Voice.\\n\\n \"That it is, Chief, that it is,\" said the others. \"You couldn\u0027t have put it better.\"\\n\\n \"And it came from my hand,\" the Chief Voice continued. \"They get visible when they leave us.\"\\n\\n \"But why do you want me to do this?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t one of your own people? Haven\u0027t you got any girls?\"\\n\\n \"We dursen\u0027t, we dursen\u0027t,\" said all the Voices. \"We\u0027re not going upstairs again.\"\\n\\n \"In other words,\" said Caspian, \"you are asking this lady to face some danger which you daren\u0027t ask your own sisters and daughters to face!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right,\" said all the Voices cheerfully. \"You couldn\u0027t have said it better. Eh, you\u0027ve had some education, you have. Anyone can see that.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of all the outrageous - \" began Edmund, but Lucy interrupted.\\n\\n \"Would I have to go upstairs at night, or would it do in daylight?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, daylight, daylight, to be sure,\" said the Chief Voice. \"Not at night. No one\u0027s asking you to do that. Go upstairs in the dark? Ugh.\"\\n\\n \"All right, then, I\u0027ll do it,\" said Lucy. \"No,\" she said, turning to the others, \"don\u0027t try to stop me. Can\u0027t you see it\u0027s no use? There are dozens of them there. We can\u0027t fight them. And the other way there is a chance.\"\\n\\n \"But a magician!\" said Caspian.\\n\\n \"I know,\" said Lucy. \"But he mayn\u0027t be as bad as they make out. Don\u0027t you get the idea that these people are not very brave?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re certainly not very clever,\" said Eustace.\\n\\n \"Look here, Lu,\" said Edmund. \"We really can\u0027t let you do a thing like this. Ask Reep, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll say just the same.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s to save my own life as well as yours,\" said Lucy. \"I don\u0027t want to be cut to bits with invisible swords any more than anyone else.\"\\n\\n \"Her Majesty is in the right,\" said Reepicheep. \"If we had any assurance of saving her by battle, our duty would be very-plain. It appears to me that we have none. And the service they ask of her is in no way contrary to her Majesty\u0027s honour, but a noble and heroical act. If the Queen\u0027s heart moves her to risk the magician, I will not speak against it.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/110/5654.html","bookId":451,"book":{"id":451,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：黎明踏浪号The Voyage of the Dawn Tread","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Voyage of the Dawn TreaderBegun in January, completed in February 1950 and published on 15 September 1952, The Voyage of the ‘Dawn Treader’ returns Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their priggish cousin, Eustac...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290647161512bd.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/110","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
