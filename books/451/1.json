{"id":28220,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"THE PICTURE IN THE BEDROOM\\n\\n THERE was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it. His parents called him Eustace Clarence and masters called him Scrubb. I can\u0027t tell you how his friends spoke to him, for he had none. He didn\u0027t call his Father and Mother \"Father\" and \"Mother\", but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people. They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers and wore a special kind of underclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on beds and the windows were always open.\\n\\n Eustace Clarence liked animals, especially beetles, if they were dead and pinned on a card. He liked books if they were books of information and had pictures of grain elevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools.\\n\\n Eustace Clarence disliked his cousins the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. But he was quite glad when he heard that Edmund and Lucy were coming to stay. For deep down inside him he liked bossing and bullying; and, though he was a puny little person who couldn\u0027t have stood up even to Lucy, let alone Edmund, in a fight, he knew that there are dozens of ways to give people a bad time if you are in your own home and they are only visitors.\\n\\n Edmund and Lucy did not at all want to come and stay with Uncle Harold and Aunt Alberta. But it really couldn\u0027t be helped. Father had got a job lecturing in America for sixteen weeks that summer, and Mother was to go with him because she hadn\u0027t had a real holiday for ten years. Peter was working very hard for an exam and he was to spend the holidays being coached by old Professor Kirke in whose house these four children had had wonderful adventures long ago in the war years. If he had still been in that house he would have had them all to stay. But he had somehow become poor since the old days and was living in a small cottage with only one bedroom to spare. It would have cost too much money to take the other three all to America, and Susan had gone.\\n\\n Grown-ups thought her the pretty one of the family and she was no good at school work (though otherwise very old for her age) and Mother said she \"would get far more out of a trip to America than the youngsters\". Edmund and Lucy tried not to grudge Susan her luck, but it was dreadful having to spend the summer holidays at their Aunt\u0027s. \"But it\u0027s far worse for me,\" said Edmund, \"because you\u0027ll at least have a room of your own and I shall have to share a bedroom with that record stinker, Eustace.\"\\n\\n The story begins on an afternoon when Edmund and Lucy were stealing a few precious minutes alone together. And of course they were talking about Narnia, which was the name of their own private and secret country. Most of us, I suppose, have a secret country but for most of us it is only an imaginary country. Edmund and Lucy were luckier than other people in that respect. Their secret country was real. They had already visited it twice; not in a game or a dream but in reality. They had got there of course by Magic, which is the only way of getting to Narnia. And a promise, or very nearly a promise, had been made them in Narnia itself that they would some day get back. You may imagine that they talked about it a good deal, when they got the chance.\\n\\n They were in Lucy\u0027s room, sitting on the edge of her bed and looking at a picture on the opposite wall. It was the only picture in the house that they liked. Aunt Alberta didn\u0027t like it at all (that was why it was put away in a little back room upstairs), but she couldn\u0027t get rid of it because it had been a wedding present from someone she did not want to offend.\\n\\n It was a picture of a ship - a ship sailing straight towards you. Her prow was gilded and shaped like the head of a dragon with wide-open mouth. She had only one mast and one large, square sail which was a rich purple. The sides of the ship - what you could see of them where the gilded wings of the dragon ended-were green. She had just run up to the top of one glorious blue wave, and the nearer slope of that wave came down towards you, with streaks and bubbles on it. She was obviously running fast before a gay wind, listing over a little on her port side. (By the way, if you are going to read this story at all, and if you don\u0027t know already, you had better get it into your head that the left of a ship when you are looking ahead, is port, and the right is starboard.) All the sunlight fell on her from that side, and the water on that side was full of greens and purples. On the other, it was darker blue from the shadow of the ship.\\n\\n \"The question is,\" said Edmund, \"whether it doesn\u0027t make things worse, looking at a Narnian ship when you can\u0027t get there.\"\\n\\n \"Even looking is better than nothing,\" said Lucy. \"And she is such a very Narnian ship.\"\\n\\n \"Still playing your old game?\" said Eustace Clarence, who had been listening outside the door and now came grinning into the room. Last year, when he had been staying with the Pevensies, he had managed to hear them all talking of Narnia and he loved teasing them about it. He thought of course that they were making it all up; and as he was far too stupid to make anything up himself, he did not approve of that.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not wanted here,\" said Edmund curtly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to think of a limerick,\" said Eustace. \"Something like this:\\n\\n \"Some kids who played games about Narnia Got gradually balmier and balmier-\"\\n\\n \"Well Narnia and balmier don\u0027t rhyme, to begin with,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an assonance,\" said Eustace.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ask him what an assy-thingummy is,\" said Edmund. \"He\u0027s only longing to be asked. Say nothing and perhaps he\u0027ll go away.\"\\n\\n Most boys, on meeting a reception like this, would either have cleared out or flared up. Eustace did neither. He just hung about grinning, and presently began talking again.\\n\\n \"Do you like that picture?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"For heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t let him get started about Art and all that,\" said Edmund hurriedly, but Lucy, who was very truthful, had already said, \"Yes, I do. I like it very much.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a rotten picture,\" said Eustace.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t see it if you step outside,\" said Edmund.\\n\\n \"Why do you like it?\" said Eustace to Lucy.\\n\\n \"Well, for one thing,\" said Lucy, \"I like it because the ship looks as if it was really moving. And the water looks as if it was really wet. And the waves look as if they were really going up and down.\"\\n\\n Of course Eustace knew lots of answers to this, but he didn\u0027t say anything. The reason was that at that very moment he looked at the waves and saw that they did look very much indeed as if they were going up and down. He had only once been in a ship (and then only as far as the Isle of Wight) and had been horribly seasick. The look of the waves in the picture made him feel sick again. He turned rather green and tried another look. And then all three children were staring with open mouths.\\n\\n What they were seeing may be hard to believe when you read it in print, but it was almost as hard to believe when you saw it happening. The things in the picture were moving. It didn\u0027t look at all like a cinema either; the colours were too real and clean and out-of-doors for that. Down went the prow of the ship into the wave and up went a great shock of spray. And then up went the wave behind her, and her stern and her deck became visible for the first time, and then disappeared as the next wave came to meet her and her bows went up again. At the same moment an exercise book which had been lying beside Edmund on the bed flapped, rose and sailed through the air to the wall behind him, and Lucy felt all her hair whipping round her face as it does on a windy day. And this was a windy day; but the wind was blowing out of the picture towards them. And suddenly with the wind came the noises-the swishing of waves and the slap of water against the ship\u0027s sides and the creaking and the overall high steady roar of air and water. But it was the smell, the wild, briny smell, which really convinced Lucy that she was not dreaming.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" came Eustace\u0027s voice, squeaky with fright and bad temper. \"It\u0027s some silly trick you two are playing. Stop it. I\u0027ll tell Alberta - Ow!\"\\n\\n The other two were much more accustomed to adventures, but, just exactly as Eustace Clarence said \"Ow,\" they both said \"Ow\" too. The reason was that a great cold, salt splash had broken right out of the frame and they were breathless from the smack of it, besides being wet through.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll smash the rotten thing,\" cried Eustace; and then several things happened at the same time. Eustace rushed towards the picture. Edmund, who knew something about magic, sprang after him, warning him to look out and not to be a fool. Lucy grabbed at him from the other side and was dragged forward. And by this time either they had grown much smaller or the picture had grown bigger. Eustace jumped to try to pull it off the wall and found himself standing on the frame; in front of him was not glass but real sea, and wind and waves rushing up to the frame as they might to a rock. He lost his head and clutched at the other two who had jumped up beside him. There was a second of struggling and shouting, and just as they thought they had got their balance a great blue roller surged up round them, swept them off their feet, and drew them down into the sea. Eustace\u0027s despairing cry suddenly ended as the water got into his mouth.\\n\\n Lucy thanked her stars that she had worked hard at her swimming last summer term. It is true that she would have got on much better if she had used a slower stroke, and also that the water felt a great deal colder than it had looked while it was only a picture. Still, she kept her head and kicked her shoes off, as everyone ought to do who falls into deep water in their clothes. She even kept her mouth shut and her eyes open. They were still quite near the ship; she saw its green side towering high above them, and people looking at her from the deck. Then, as one might have expected, Eustace clutched at her in a panic and down they both went.\\n\\n When they came up again she saw a white figure diving off the ship\u0027s side. Edmund was close beside her now, treading water, and had caught the arms of the howling Eustace. Then someone else, whose face was vaguely familiar, slipped an arm under her from the other side. There was a lot of shouting going on from the ship, heads crowding together above the bulwarks, ropes being thrown. Edmund and the stranger were fastening ropes round her. After that followed what seemed a very long delay during which her face got blue and her teeth began chattering. In reality the delay was not very long; they were waiting till the moment when she could be got on board the ship without being dashed against its side. Even with all their best endeavours she had a bruised knee when she finally stood, dripping and shivering, on the deck. After her Edmund was heaved up, and then the miserable Eustace. Last of all came the stranger - a golden-headed boy some years older than herself.\\n\\n \"Ca - Ca - Caspian!\" gasped Lucy as soon as she had breath enough. For Caspian it was; Caspian, the boy king of Narnia whom they had helped to set on the throne during their last visit. Immediately Edmund recognized him too. All three shook hands and clapped one another on the back with great delight.\\n\\n \"But who is your friend?\" said Caspian almost at once, turning to Eustace with his cheerful smile. But Eustace was crying much harder than any boy of his age has a right to cry when nothing worse than a wetting has happened to him, and would only yell out, \"Let me go. Let me go back. I don\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n \"Let you go?\" said Caspian. \"But where?\"\\n\\n Eustace rushed to the ship\u0027s side, as if he expected to see the picture frame hanging above the sea, and perhaps a glimpse of Lucy\u0027s bedroom. What he saw was blue waves flecked with foam, and paler blue sky, both spreading without a break to the horizon. Perhaps we can hardly blame him if his heart sank. He was promptly sick.\\n\\n \"Hey! Rynelf,\" said Caspian to one of the sailors. \"Bring spiced wine for their Majesties. You\u0027ll need something to warm you after that dip.\" He called Edmund and Lucy their Majesties because they and Peter and Susan had all been Kings and Queens of Narnia long before his time. Narnian time flows differently from ours. If you spent a hundred years in Narnia, you would still come back to our world at the very same hour of the very same day on which you left. And then, if you went back to Narnia after spending a week here, you might find that a thousand Narnian years had passed, or only a day, or no time at all. You never know till you get there. Consequently, when the Pevensie children had returned to Narnia last time for their second visit, it was (for the Narnians) as if King Arthur came back to Britain, as some people say he will. And I say the sooner the better.\\n\\n Rynelf returned with the spiced wine steaming in a flagon and four silver cups. It was just what one wanted, and as Lucy and Edmund sipped it they could feel the warmth going right down to their toes. But Eustace made faces and spluttered and spat it out and was sick again and began to cry again and asked if they hadn\u0027t any Plumptree\u0027s Vitaminized Nerve Food and could it be made with distilled water and anyway he insisted on being put ashore at the next station.\\n\\n \"This is a merry shipmate you\u0027ve brought us, Brother,\" whispered Caspian to Edmund with a chuckle; but before he could say anything more Eustace burst out again.\\n\\n \"Oh! Ugh! What on earth\u0027s that! Take it away, the horrid thing.\" .\\n\\n He really had some excuse this time for feeling a little surprised. Something very curious indeed had come out of the cabin in the poop and was slowly approaching them. You might call it - and indeed it was - a Mouse. But then it was a Mouse on its hind legs and stood about two feet high. A thin band of gold passed round its head under one ear and over the other and in this was stuck a long crimson feather. (As the Mouse\u0027s fur was very dark, almost black, the effect was bold and striking.) Its left paw rested on the hilt of a sword very nearly as long as its tail. Its balance, as it paced gravely along the swaying deck, was perfect, and its manners courtly. Lucy and Edmund recognized it at once Reepicheep, the most valiant of all the Talking Beasts of Narnia, and the Chief Mouse. It had won undying glory in the second Battle of Beruna. Lucy longed, as she had always done, to take Reepicheep up in her arms and cuddle him. But this, as she well knew, was a pleasure she could never have: it would have offended him deeply. Instead, she went down on one knee to talk to him.\\n\\n Reepicheep put forward his left leg, drew back his right, bowed, kissed her hand, straightened himself, twirled his whiskers, and said in his shrill, piping voice:\\n\\n \"My humble duty to your Majesty. And to King Edmund, too.\" (Here he bowed again.) \"Nothing except your Majesties\u0027 presence was lacking to this glorious venture.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh, take it away,\" wailed Eustace. \"I hate mice. And I never could bear performing animals. They\u0027re silly and vulgar and-and sentimental.\"\\n\\n \"Am I to understand,\" said Reepicheep to Lucy after a long stare at Eustace, \"that this singularly discourteous person is under your Majesty\u0027s protection? Because, if not-\"\\n\\n At this moment Lucy and Edmund both sneezed.\\n\\n \"What a fool I am to keep you all standing here in your wet things,\" said Caspian. \"Come on below and get changed. I\u0027ll give you my cabin of course, Lucy, but I\u0027m afraid we have no women\u0027s clothes on board. You\u0027ll have to make do with some of mine. Lead the way, Reepicheep, like a good fellow.\"\\n\\n \"To the convenience of a lady,\" said Reepicheep, \"even a question of honour must give way - at least for the moment -\" and here he looked very hard at Eustace. But Caspian hustled them on and in a few minutes Lucy found herself passing through the door into the stern cabin. She fell in love with it at once - the three square windows that looked out on the blue, swirling water astern, the low cushioned benches round three sides of the table, the swinging silver lamp overhead (Dwarfs\u0027 work, she knew at once by its exquisite delicacy) and the flat gold image of Aslan the Lion on the forward wall above the door. All this she took in in a flash, for Caspian immediately opened a door on the starboard side, and said, \"This\u0027ll be your room, Lucy. I\u0027ll just get some dry things for myself-\" he was rummaging in one of the lockers while he spoke - \"and then leave you to change. If you\u0027ll fling your wet things outside the door I\u0027ll get them taken to the galley to be dried.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/110/5646.html","bookId":451,"book":{"id":451,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：黎明踏浪号The Voyage of the Dawn Tread","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Voyage of the Dawn TreaderBegun in January, completed in February 1950 and published on 15 September 1952, The Voyage of the ‘Dawn Treader’ returns Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their priggish cousin, Eustac...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290647161512bd.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/110","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
