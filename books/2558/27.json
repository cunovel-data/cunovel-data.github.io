{"id":112098,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Michael woke up with a start. It was just after ten in the morning. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he hissed. Drugged with sleep, Emma propped herself up on her elbows. \u0027What?\u0027 she mumbled. \u0027Listen,\u0027 he hissed again. In the distance, and disappearing quickly, was the sound of an engine.\\n\\n \u0027More people like we heard yesterday,\u0027 he said, jumping out of bed and struggling in the gloom to find his clothes and put them on. \u0027I\u0027ve got to get out there and see where they\u0027re going.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 asked Emma, confused. \u0027Stupid bloody question,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027You know why. These are survivors. These people could...\u0027 \u0027These people are leaving here,\u0027 she said, her voice still tired and heavy with sleep.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no point going out now. All you\u0027re going to be able to do is watch them disappear.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s got to be better than just sitting here and...\u0027 \u0027Why not wait? They came back yesterday, didn\u0027t they? Surely they\u0027ll come back again today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 he said as he pulled on his jeans and fastened his belt. \u0027No,\u0027 she yawned, \u0027not necessarily, but probably. You\u0027ve got to admit, there\u0027s a damn good chance they\u0027ll be back later.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but...\u0027 \u0027But what?\u0027 Michael stopped what he was doing and peered at Emma through the early morning gloom. Dejected, he threw his T-shirt down onto the bed in front of her and sat down heavily next to her feet. He knew she was right.\\n\\n In the time it had taken him to put on his jeans and socks the noise outside had already disappeared. Whoever these people were, he had to agree it was likely they\u0027d be back again later. \u0027Come here,\u0027 Emma said quietly. Michael looked up at her with sad, childlike eyes. She could see that he was struggling.\\n\\n As strong, resilient and brave as they both tried constantly to be for each other, it was becoming harder and harder just to get through each day. The lack of any news, direction or purpose was slowly killing them, and that was why Michael had reacted to the sound of the engine in the way that he had. Every last fibre of his body wanted to believe that the survivors they had heard would bring an end to the bleak and relentless nightmare that their once ordinary lives had become over the last few weeks. Michael lay down on the bed next to Emma and rested his head on the pillow close to hers. She rolled over onto her side and looked deep into his tired face.\\n\\n He stared up at the ceiling, excited by the sound he\u0027d heard but also angry and infuriated that he was still no closer to finding out who these survivors were and where they\u0027d come from. He knew he\u0027d probably get the answers to his questions in the near future but that wasn\u0027t good enough - he wanted to know now. Emma wrapped her arm around him and pulled herself closer. He could feel her breath on the side of his face. It relaxed him. For a moment it made what was happening outside feel somewhat less important. \u0027They will be back you know,\u0027 she whispered again with real belief and conviction in her voice. Michael knew that she was right.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure of it. It\u0027s too much of a coincidence for us to hear them travelling past here twice in two days and back again last night. They must have a base nearby.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Michael grunted. \u0027We should move the van,\u0027 she suggested.\\n\\n \u0027Move it into a place overlooking the track.\u0027 He nodded. \u0027Suppose so.\u0027 \u0027Look, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do,\u0027 she said gently, still trying desperately to keep him positive and focussed. \u0027We\u0027ll drive across the hills until we find somewhere we can see the track from and we\u0027ll sit and wait.\\n\\n We can sit in the front and watch and as soon as we see them we\u0027ll try and follow them back to wherever it is they\u0027ve come from.\u0027 Michael nodded again. Her well-meaning words, although perhaps said more out of duty than belief, were welcome and appreciated. He was lucky to have Emma. He glanced across at her and lifted his hand and brushed a fallen curl of hair away from her face.\\n\\n She smiled and pulled herself even closer so that their faces were almost touching. He kissed her lightly on the cheek and then kissed her lips. He kissed her again and then pulled back slightly and stared deep into her eyes. Much as they both craved warmth, comfort, protection and countless other things, to be safe and to be this close to each other was enough for now. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-27.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
