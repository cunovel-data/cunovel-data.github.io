{"id":112094,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"The dead world was like a vacuum. Even the slightest noise travelled huge distances, carried for miles on otherwise undisturbed gusts of wind. The movement of the soldiers in their powerful transport created waves of interest along the entire length of their journey - from the rolling and exposed hills around the bunker itself right through to the cold heart of the city. In the university accommodation block every single survivor had been stirred and encouraged by the sounds outside. More than just another random crash or unexplained disturbance as they had heard many times before, the noises they heard through the rain today were different. They were purposeful, intentional, mechanical noises. They were sounds which were obviously being made by other survivors. And the gun shots and shouting that filled the air had confirmed beyond doubt that other people had managed to continue to exist through the mayhem.\n The survivors sheltering in the university had become cocooned in their hideaway. Too afraid to leave the relative safety of their building, the bravest of them had climbed up onto the roof, battling against violent weather conditions. From their high and precarious vantage point they had been unable to see the other people. They had, however, watched with mounting excitement as vast crowds of rotting bodies had begun to drift away from the university site and head back deeper into the city. Although thousands remained, the number of bodies left wandering outside the accommodation block had reduced reassuringly. The survivors knew, however, that it wouldn\u0027t take much to attract the collective attention of the dead and bring them staggering back to them. And that was the quandary that split the group in two.\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to do anything that\u0027s going to bring those bloody things back here,\u0027 snapped Bernard Heath. The sudden force and nervous energy and volume in his voice belied the fact that fear was the only reason he was opposed to the plan that had been put forward. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, Bernard,\u0027 Donna sighed, \u0027can\u0027t you see what we\u0027re saying here? We know that whatever we do will bring the bodies back, but chances are it\u0027ll bring those survivors to us as well. Do you really think we can afford to stay out here on our own for very much longer?\u0027 \u0027But we\u0027re not out here on our own, are we?\u0027 he argued. \u0027There are more than forty of us here.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s as maybe,\u0027 she replied, \u0027but how many of them are in this room with us now? How many people do you actually see each day?\u0027 Heath looked around the assembly hall.\n She was right, less than half of the total number of people in the building were in the room with them. It was rare to see more than ten of them together. Most continued to cower in silence in their individual rooms. \u0027We\u0027re stuck here,\u0027 Phil Croft volunteered from across the hall. \u0027Okay, that\u0027s not proved to be too much of a problem so far, but give it a few more weeks and this shelter we\u0027ve got here could well turn into a prison.\u0027 \u0027No matter what we do those bodies will keep returning here,\u0027 Donna continued. \u0027The rest of the city is silent. We can\u0027t help but draw attention to ourselves, can we?\u0027 \u0027We can try,\u0027 Heath protested. \u0027We could...\u0027 \u0027We could what? Shut ourselves in a single room up high and hold our breath so they can\u0027t hear us breathing?\u0027 \u0027No, I just think...\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve seen how those things are beginning to behave, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 she asked, her voice weary. \u0027They\u0027re becoming more and more active every day. I know they\u0027re not particularly strong on their own but given with the numbers we\u0027re dealing with here...\u0027\n \u0027And we\u0027re going to need to go out for supplies again soon,\u0027 said Croft. \u0027And as time goes on we\u0027ll need to go further and further afield to get those supplies. We\u0027re going to be spending longer out in the open.\u0027 \u0027We need to start getting ourselves organised,\u0027 Donna continued. \u0027Get some kind of routine and order to what we\u0027re doing. We need to find a way of letting those other survivors know we\u0027re here without...\u0027 Sat in the corner of the room, Nathan Holmes got up and walked towards the nearest exit. \u0027You\u0027re a bunch of fucking idiots,\u0027 he spat. The rest of the people in the hall turned and stared at him. \u0027Look at you. What are you trying to do here? Think you\u0027re going to build some brave new fucking world out of...\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not trying to do anything except...\u0027 Donna began before Holmes interrupted. \u0027What you\u0027re trying to do is pointless. It\u0027s all pointless. You shouldn\u0027t even be wasting your time talking about it. As soon as I can I\u0027m getting out of here and I\u0027m going to...\u0027 \u0027We all know exactly what you\u0027re going to do,\u0027 Donna sighed. \u0027You\u0027re going to drink yourself stupid so that you can forget everything. We\u0027ve heard you say it a thousand times. You don\u0027t give a damn about anyone but yourself.\u0027 \u0027Too right I don\u0027t,\u0027 he replied, \u0027why should I?\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t you see how our chances will improve if we work together?\u0027 Croft asked. Holmes looked up to the ceiling in despair. \u0027But that\u0027s my point, what chance have we got? Everybody in this damn building has lost absolutely everything. Getting out of here and trying to forget everything is the best option for anyone who\u0027s got any degree of sense left...\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re confusing sense and selfishness,\u0027 Donna mumbled under her breath.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 Croft said, the patience in his voice wearing thin, \u0027all we\u0027re talking about doing here is setting up some kind of beacon so that if and when those others come back they\u0027ll know where we are and they\u0027ll come to us. We\u0027re not trying to make great plans for the future because we don\u0027t know if any of us have got a fucking future!\u0027 \u0027But your beacon will attract the bodies,\u0027 protested Heath. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, man,\u0027 Croft seethed. \u0027Can\u0027t you see that\u0027s a risk we\u0027re going to have to take?\u0027 Jack Baxter had been watching the increasingly tense conversation develop. \u0027What if we put a beacon on the roof?\u0027 he asked. \u0027What\u0027s that going to achieve?\u0027 Heath wondered. \u0027Think about it, if we put some kind of beacon up on high then it\u0027s not going to be immediately obvious to the bodies but a survivor...\u0027 \u0027...a survivor would know that anything up on the roof would probably have been put there intentionally,\u0027 added Donna, completing his sentence for him. \u0027If we\u0027re talking about lighting a fire, then a survivor would know that any blaze would most probably start somewhere inside the building and work its way up, it wouldn\u0027t start on top, would it?\u0027 \u0027I understand that,\u0027 moaned Heath, sitting down on an uncomfortable plastic chair, \u0027but if and when those other people get here, they\u0027re going to bring the bodies with them, aren\u0027t they? It\u0027s not going to matter how careful you are with your bloody beacon, is it?\u0027\n Donna looked at the frightened lecturer for a few long seconds before turning her back on him in frustration. She understood what he was saying, she just couldn\u0027t understand why it was such a issue for him. To her the solution to their problem and the potential side-effects were obvious and unavoidable. Increasing the number of bodies outside the building seemed to be a small price to pay if it meant they could make contact with other survivors - people with transport and weapons who, it seemed, were surviving out in the open. Just over thirty miles from the city, and two and a half miles away from the concealed entrance to the underground bunker, two survivors sat together in nervous silence. Hiding in a relatively well-appointed motorhome they had taken from outside another dead town just three days ago, the couple had driven out to the most exposed and isolated area of land they had been able to find. Since being forced to leave the farmhouse where they had previously sheltered, Michael Collins and Emma Mitchell had lived from hand to mouth like scavenging animals.\n Five days ago the building where they had hidden in relatively safety for the best part of two weeks had been overrun by hundreds of wandering corpses, attracted to their remote and otherwise inconspicuous location by the activity and sounds the survivors had made simply by existing. They had taken many precautions to separate themselves from the rotting remains of the population, but all their efforts had ultimately been in vain. Michael and Emma had learnt to their bitter cost that there was no way of escaping the unwanted attentions of millions upon millions of desperate, diseased and increasingly vicious corpses. The couple had heard the engine in the distance when the soldiers had emerged from their hidden base earlier in the day. At first it had seemed impossible to believe - since leaving the farmhouse neither of them had seen any indication that other people remained alive - not a single sound or movement that might have pointed to the existence of other survivors.\n But the noise of the engine had been definite and unmistakable, and it had filled them both with sudden unexpected hope where before they had felt nothing but pain, emptiness and desolation. By the time they were out of the motorhome and were able to look for the source of the sound the soldiers had been long gone. They did, however, stumble upon a straight gravel track at the bottom of a hill near to where they were parked. In the absence of any other roads or pathways for miles around, the track seemed logically to be a good starting point in their search for other survivors. Michael had supposed that anyone else attempting to survive in this brutal, inhospitable world might have found themselves a base similar to the farmhouse where he and Emma had hidden. It followed that if these people were heading out for supplies, there was a fairly good chance they would be back again before long.\n He was right. The darkness of early evening had all but swallowed up the last light of the gloomy afternoon when they heard the sound again. Distant and faint at first, it had quickly increased in volume. Ignorant to the dangers of being outside and exposed, Michael threw open the motorhome door and jumped down the steps. He sprinted across the long, rain-soaked grass and crouched down on a small rocky outcrop from where he was able to get a clear view of a long stretch of the track below. And then he saw it - a huge, powerful military transporter which roared defiantly along the track. Michael couldn\u0027t see the driver of the vehicle, or how many people were inside, but it didn\u0027t matter. More important than just finding other survivors, he now knew that these people were strong and well organised. And if they really were the military, what did that mean? How many hundreds of them could there be nearby? The transport disappeared into the darkness. He stood up and ran cautiously along the exposed brow of the hill, following the machine until it was completely out of view. Where did the track lead? He stared into the darkness and contemplated what he had seen for a few silent seconds before remembering the danger of being alone outside and running back to the motorhome. \u0027Well?\u0027 Emma asked as he let himself back inside. \u0027Well what? I saw a bloody big army machine. Don\u0027t know exactly what it was but...\u0027\n \u0027The army?\u0027 \u0027Looked like it,\u0027 Michael said breathlessly as he locked the door behind him and drew the thick curtains which they used to stop any light from spilling out into the darkness and revealing their location to the rest of the world. \u0027Couldn\u0027t be sure, but it was definitely some kind of armoured machine.\u0027 \u0027Where did it go?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. Emma had an infuriating habit of asking questions which she knew he couldn\u0027t answer. \u0027It was following the track we found earlier,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027so I guess it was going wherever the track leads.\u0027 \u0027And where\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027How the hell am I supposed to know? I suggest we should try and find out tomorrow.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you want to look tonight?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he replied, shaking his head. \u0027The light\u0027s almost gone. It\u0027s too dangerous. We\u0027ll wait until morning.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-23.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
