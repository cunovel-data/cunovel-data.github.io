He wasn\u0027t planning on going anywhere in particular, he just needed a change of surroundings. Like many of the other desperate individuals sheltering in the university, the relative quiet and lack of distractions in the building had left him with nothing to do but dwell on the inexplicable hell that his life had become. Jack had spent most of the day sitting on the end of his bed just thinking. He couldn\u0027t even remember what he\u0027d been thinking about.\\n\\n At the far end of the corridor was a narrow square landing leading onto a staircase. Floor to ceiling length windows let the grey autumnal light seep inside.\\n\\n Jack stood a short distance away from the nearest window and peered down into the mass of dark, decaying bodies still being drawn towards the university and, in particular, the accommodation block.\\n\\n Why did they stay, he wondered? He took a few cautious steps forward. His position was too far and too high for him to be seen by any of the bodies but he still took care to stay to the side and try and keep out of sight. He was terrified that one of the corpses might see him and start to react. He imagined the effect of that single reaction running through the entire crowd. He\u0027d seen it happen several times before today - a slight disturbance in one part of the huge gathering would spread across the immense gathering like a shock wave. It had happened when the woman had jumped to her death from the window earlier.\\n\\n He could just about see her from where he was standing. Poor cow, he thought. He couldn\u0027t help thinking that she was better off where she was now. \u0027Bloody mess, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 a sudden and unexpected voice said from close behind him. Jack quickly turned around to see that it was Bernard Heath. He\u0027d noticed that Heath seemed to have a real problem with being on his own. He could often be seen walking around the building in search of someone to be with.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Jack,\u0027 Heath continued, \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to disturb you. It\u0027s just that I saw you standing here and I thought I\u0027d check that you were...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 Jack said quietly, anticipating his concerns and truncating his sentence. Heath took a few steps forward and peered down into the rotting crowd. \u0027I reckon this lot will start to disappear sooner or later,\u0027 he said with a tone of unexpected optimism in his voice.\\n\\n \u0027As soon as something happens somewhere else to attract their attention, they\u0027ll be off.\u0027 \u0027Like what?\u0027 Jack asked. \u0027There\u0027s not really very much going on out there, is there?\u0027 Heath didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s getting to me,\u0027 he said instead, his voice quiet and tired and unexpectedly candid, \u0027it\u0027s how slowly everything seems to happen around here. I mean, I\u0027m sitting downstairs with the rest of them and no-one says a word. I look up at the clock and get distracted. Next time I look at the clock it feels like ages later but only a couple of minutes have gone by...\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s why I\u0027m out here,\u0027 Jack mumbled, still staring into the dark crowd below. \u0027I was just sitting in my room staring at the walls and going out of my bloody mind.\u0027 \u0027Have you tried reading?\u0027 \u0027No, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did,\u0027 he said, scratching the side of his bearded face. \u0027I used to lecture here. I went back to my office a couple of days ago and picked up a few books. Brought them back with me and sat down to read one but...\u0027 \u0027But what?\u0027 \u0027Couldn\u0027t do it.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders and rubbed his eyes. For a moment Jack looked up from the bodies and stared into the other man\u0027s drawn and weary face. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he answered slowly.\\n\\n \u0027I just couldn\u0027t do it. I started to read a novel. I got through a few pages before I had to stop. All it did was remind me of what\u0027s happened and what I\u0027ve lost and...\u0027 He stopped talking, feeling suddenly awkward and somewhat embarrassed that he was letting his feelings show so readily again. \u0027So what happens next then?\u0027 wondered Jack, sensing Heath\u0027s pain and making a conscious effort to change the focus of the conversation from dwelling on what had gone to trying to look forward. Heath went through the motions of thinking carefully for a few moments. It was pointless really - he\u0027d spent most of the last week pondering endless variations on the question he\u0027d just been asked and in all that time he hadn\u0027t managed to find any answers. \u0027Sit and wait,\u0027 he said eventually. \u0027Is that it?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t see that there\u0027s anything else we can do.\u0027\\n\\n For a while the two men stood side by side in silence and looked out over the remains of the diseased, battered world. Several minutes later Heath walked away, soon followed by Jack who dejectedly made his way back to his room.\\n\\n He lay down on the bed and tried to sleep. Sleep was just about the only way he knew to block out the nightmare for a while. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-19.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
