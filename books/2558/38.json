{"id":112109,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"It was time. Six volunteer survivors stood outside at the back of the accommodation block in a small, sheltered alcove where several tall, overflowing and foul-smelling waste bins were stored. There were no bodies around that they could see. Various building extensions, walls, fences and other obstructions seemed to have prevented the creatures from stumbling round to the area. \u0027Ready?\u0027 Phil Croft asked. The others looked far from sure. The doctor did up the zip on the fleece he was wearing. It was a cold afternoon. Although fairly bright, there was a threat of rain in the air and ominously heavy clouds were approaching from the east. \u0027Suppose so,\u0027 Paul Castle mumbled. \u0027Never going to be a good time for this though, is there?\u0027 \u0027If you can\u0027t handle it why don\u0027t you just go back inside?\u0027 Jack Baxter snapped nervously. \u0027Quit fucking moaning.\u0027 \u0027Give it a break you old...\u0027 Castle began. \u0027Okay,\u0027 Cooper said, cutting across the increasingly nervous conversation and having to raise his voice to make himself heard over the gusting wind, \u0027this is where we shut up. Anyone speaks and draws attention to us once we\u0027re out there and we\u0027re history. I tell you, those bodies aren\u0027t quick or strong enough on their own, but if you do something stupid and end up with a hundred of them coming at you, you\u0027re going to have real problems.\u0027 Baxter thrust his cold hands into his jacket pockets and leant back against the red-brick wall behind him. He was terrified. Perhaps that was why he\u0027d reacted so angrily to Castle\u0027s nervous complaint seconds earlier. He\u0027d been close to throwing up before they\u0027d left the safety of the building. He didn\u0027t tell the others, of course. They\u0027d all been so sure of their plans when they\u0027d spoken this morning and last night. Doing this had seemed such a good idea before they\u0027d actually stepped out into the open and stood there unprotected. A single body tripped across a footpath a short distance ahead of them. The six survivors stared in silence and watched anxiously as it moved awkwardly away. Steve Armitage (a long-distance lorry driver who had hardly spoken until today but who had volunteered to do this because he could drive a truck and because he could no longer stand being trapped indoors) licked his dry lips and nervously lit a cigarette. \u0027Put that bloody thing out,\u0027 Croft hissed quietly. \u0027You fucking idiot! We\u0027re trying to blend in here. How many of those damn things have you seen smoking?\u0027 Armitage dropped the cigarette down onto the ground and stubbed it out with his foot. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he whispered apologetically. \u0027Not thinking. Bit nervous.\u0027 Cooper\u0027s military training was beginning to show. Although he may well have been as scared and apprehensive as the other five men, it was not at all noticeable. He remained calm and collected, as if this was something he did every day. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Steve,\u0027 he said softly, doing his best to reassure the struggling lorry driver. \u0027We can do this, you know. We just have to keep our nerve and stick together. Take your time, don\u0027t do anything stupid and we\u0027ll be okay.\u0027 Bernard Heath was, surprisingly, the sixth survivor who had ventured out into the open. Although it had seemed that his cowardice and nerves had been steadily increasing during the days and weeks of their confinement, he remained a sensible and rational man at heart. He had gradually come to accept that his earlier protestations and demands that they should stay inside were driven more by fear than any rational thought processes. Much as he still preferred the idea of staying locked away in the accommodation block, he understood that was no longer an option. Perhaps trying to make amends for the conflict and arguments he had helped prolong recently, he had volunteered to be one of the first to leave the protection of the building. Cooper glanced round at the faces of the others before nodding his head in the general direction of the city centre and starting to walk. Weighed down heavily with their individual nerves and trepidation, the six men began to move towards the dead heart of the town in slow, shuffling single file. The door from which they had emerged from their shelter had been hidden around the back of the building. As the majority of bodies had reached the university from the direction of the town, the survivors came across relatively few of them at first. Those corpses they did see were distracted - banging and scratching incessantly at the sides of the building, trying to get inside despite the fact that it was clearly pointless. Cooper kept his head low, doing his best to imitate the weary, slothful movements of the dead. Untrained and having been shut away inside for some considerable time, the other men were unable to match his military self-control and found it difficult to camouflage their strained emotions. They couldn\u0027t help but stare at the nightmarish scene which quickly unfolded around them. It was the noise they noticed first. Unexpected and unsettling, the constant low sounds served to emphasise the sudden closeness and reality of the danger. Inside the university they had become used to the quiet. Outside, however, things were very different. There remained an eerie, vacuous silence where the noise of traffic and the day-to-day had once been but, at the same time, a low and constant humming and moaning filled the air - the sound of bodies dragging their feet along the ground and the buzzing of millions of insects feeding off their decaying flesh. The noxious smell of the rotting corpses was stifling. Jack Baxter felt the bile rising in his stomach. He didn\u0027t know if he was going to be able to handle this. Cooper shuffled away in the general direction of the subway which he had originally used to reach the university. He didn\u0027t relish the idea of disappearing down into that dark and foreboding hole again. The crowd, however, had swollen to such an extent that it was difficult to be sure whereabouts the entrance was. For a moment he toyed with the idea of simply taking a chance and staying above ground and just running to reach the courthouse. He knew that he couldn\u0027t do that without talking to the others first, and he knew that he couldn\u0027t communicate with them in any way without alerting the corpses to their presence. The icy fear he felt when he risked a quick sideways glance into the vast gathering of bodies a little way ahead kept him focussed. \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 he heard someone say from a short distance behind him. The voice wasn\u0027t particularly loud, but in this dangerous and unpredictable environment even a whisper was too much of a risk to take. Cooper lifted his hand and cautiously turned his head to try and remind the others of the danger. What he saw made him freeze with horror. \u0027Shit,\u0027 he hissed under his breath. The bodies were reacting. Too far away to have heard the voices, the corpses were beginning to make definite conscious movements towards the exposed survivors. Those on the nearest edge of the massive crowd had lifted their rotting heads and were looking at the line of men slowly snaking towards the subway. A few of the bodies had begun to stagger away from the main group and were now lurching towards them. As those corpses moved so the attention of others was caught and, in seconds, a deadly chain reaction had begun. Like the first battalions of a relentless advancing army the cadavers began to approach. \u0027What the fuck is going on?\u0027 a terrified Phil Croft demanded, forgetting himself. The sound of his voice caused hundreds more vile creatures to look up and begin to peel away from the crowd and move towards them. \u0027You said they\u0027d ignore us if we...\u0027 Cooper knew there was no time to stand and argue. By all accounts the behaviour of the bodies had been changing constantly since the day they\u0027d been infected - in the short time he\u0027d been away from his base he\u0027d seen them become more aggressive. A few days earlier slow movements and feigned lethargy had been sufficient to fool the dead. Today the creatures appeared to be reacting with unmistakable intent. Although still awkward and clumsy, today they were moving with ominous speed and purpose. \u0027Move!\u0027 Cooper ordered. \u0027Just get to the fucking courthouse now!\u0027 Without waiting for further instruction the survivors turned and sprinted towards the city centre. Cooper led the way but, not knowing the city particularly well, he ran without direction. \u0027This way!\u0027 Paul Castle shouted, running away to the soldier\u0027s left. The others followed as swarms of bodies gathered around them. Castle glanced back over his shoulder. His speed and panic was such that it was impossible to make out details, instead he was just aware of an increasing dark mass of cadavers following them. Terrified, he turned back around and ran into a single random corpse, sending it flying to the ground.154 Castle, the soldier and the doctor were relatively young and in good health. Baxter and Heath, although somewhat older, were also able to keep up. Steve Armitage, however, was struggling. With tears of panic and fear running freely down his face, the overweight truck driver lashed out at the countless figures which lurched and lunged towards him. For the moment the force of his large bulk was enough to keep them at bay. It was difficult to keep sight of the rest of the group ahead, such was the number of ragged bodies that crisscrossed his path and grabbed at him with clumsy, decaying hands. They weren\u0027t going to make it. From what he\u0027d been told he guessed the courthouse was still a fair distance away. Cooper knew he could do it, but it was doubtful whether the older men would keep up. \u0027Over there,\u0027 he yelled, suddenly changing direction and moving to his right. He needed to find shelter. It didn\u0027t matter what or where, they just needed to get out of sight for a time until the crowd\u0027s interest in them had dissipated. He pushed open a heavy door in the middle of a small, glass-fronted bookshop and held it open for the other survivors. \u0027Go through to the back,\u0027 he yelled as Heath and Baxter crashed breathlessly past him. Armitage was almost there. Cooper reached out and grabbed his arm and pulled him through. \u0027Get out of sight.\u0027 Croft dragged a bookcase and low reading table across the door once Cooper had managed to push it shut. Already there were rotting faces pressed against the glass, smashing their fists against the window, trying to get at the survivors inside. Cooper gently pushed Croft deeper into the building. The others were waiting in a small, square office. \u0027What the hell are we going to do now?\u0027 Heath asked anxiously. He looked at Armitage. The red-faced man was slumped over a desk in the middle of the room, fighting to get his breath back. \u0027We keep going,\u0027 Croft said. \u0027What option have we got? We can either turn back and fight our way through a fucking huge crowd of bodies, or we can do what we came out here to do, get some transport organised, and then fight our way back through a fucking huge crowd of bodies.\u0027 His humour wasn\u0027t appreciated. Regardless, the rest of the men knew that they didn\u0027t have a choice. \u0027Where exactly are we?\u0027 Cooper asked. \u0027Where are we in relation to the court?\u0027 Castle, standing with his hands on his hips and breathing heavily, cleared his throat and looked round. \u0027Not too far to go,\u0027 he replied, moving slightly so that he could look through another door and out towards the back of the building. \u0027I reckon it\u0027ll be easier if we go through the back.\u0027 \u0027Fine,\u0027 Cooper said. \u0027We ready?\u0027 Armitage looked up in disbelief. \u0027Give us a minute,\u0027 he complained. \u0027You can rest when we\u0027ve found ourselves a fleet of trucks, okay?\u0027 The lorry driver covered his head in despair and then pushed himself back up. \u0027All right?\u0027 Baxter asked. Armitage nodded. \u0027Lead the way, Paul,\u0027 Cooper ordered. Trembling with nerves Castle did as he was told, cautiously creeping through the building until he reached the back door which opened out into a communal loading area shared with a number of neighbouring shops. A narrow service road ran along the back of the buildings. As far as he could see there were no bodies nearby. \u0027Which way?\u0027 Cooper whispered. Castle nodded to his right. \u0027Okay,\u0027 the soldier continued, \u0027stick together and not a bloody sound from anyone, understand?\u0027 No-one responded. \u0027Let\u0027s go.\u0027 Castle began to walk away from the shop, pressing himself against the nearest wall and doing his best to blend into the shadows. In the middle of the group Armitage silently cursed his condition. He wished that he was younger and fitter. Although no doubt amplified in his mind, he feared that the sound of his heavy breathing might be enough to bring the bodies to them again. The service road carried on for a hundred meters or so before taking a sharp right and rejoining the main road. Castle paused just before the turning. \u0027How far?\u0027 Cooper asked, his voice deathly quiet. \u0027Carry on along this road and we\u0027ll reach another junction,\u0027 he replied, nodding further down the service road. \u0027Go left and the court\u0027s at the top of the main shopping street. A few hundred yards probably.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s it look like?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Big building, bronzed glass in the windows, steps up to the front door.\u0027 \u0027Who else knows what it looks like?\u0027 The other men, who had now grouped around Castle and the soldier, nodded. Baxter wasn\u0027t sure. \u0027Is it by...\u0027 he began. \u0027Follow the rest of us,\u0027 Cooper snapped. \u0027Wait here for a second. I\u0027ll go and see what\u0027s around.\u0027 Silently creeping further down the service road, he stopped when he reached the point where it merged with the main road. Cautiously he stuck his head around the corner and looked up and down the once busy street. There were plenty of bodies around, but considerably fewer than they had seen before they\u0027d taken shelter in the bookshop. He guessed that the disturbance they\u0027d caused back at the university would have resulted in many of the corpses gravitating around that area. He made his way back to the others. \u0027There are a fair few of them about,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027The only way to get through them is to ignore them. Try and forget they\u0027re there. Run through them. They can\u0027t match speed and the power we\u0027ve got.\u0027 \u0027A few thousand of the bastards could...\u0027 Armitage moaned. \u0027There aren\u0027t a few thousand out there,\u0027 Cooper replied, \u0027but there will be if you panic so shut up, take a deep fucking breath and follow me.\u0027 Without waiting for a response he headed back towards the main road. The rest of the survivors followed behind, their nervousness increasing with every step. Bernard Heath took deep breaths of stagnant air in an attempt to fill his lungs with oxygen before they started running again. Cooper paused and turned back to make sure they were together. \u0027Ready?\u0027 he asked. No response. He turned and ran. Instinctively the others followed at a frantic pace. Immediately those straggling bodies left in the street turned and moved towards the sudden disturbance. Cooper led the way, pushing corpses away to the side as he forced his way forward. Castle was close behind. A myriad of unexpected emotions ran through his mind as he moved. As the inhabitants of the city had rotted and decayed, so the city itself also appeared to have deteriorated. The once familiar sights of streets that he\u0027d walked along hundreds of time seemed to have changed almost beyond recognition. Unchecked moss and weeds grew between the cracks in the pavements and climbed the walls of cold and silent buildings. Motionless, skeletal corpses lay in the gutter being steadily devoured by the passage of time and by the numerous rodents and insects which fed off their disintegrating flesh. A random body lashed out and caught him off-guard. He grabbed it by the neck and threw it into a crowd of three more advancing cadavers. \u0027Left!\u0027 he shouted at the soldier who, in his haste and desire to keep moving, had just passed the turning. Castle changed direction, followed closely by the rest of the men who were all somehow managing to keep a comparable pace. Bernard Heath and Steve Armitage in particular were moving with unexpected velocity and newfound determination. Pure adrenaline and fear was driving them to run like men half their ages. Disorientated by its overgrown appearance and the sudden effort of the sprint through the streets, it took Phil Croft a while to recognise the court building. As he swerved to avoid another lurching body his eyes locked onto the steep steps which led up from ground level to the court\u0027s imposing bronzetinted glass entrance doors. Cooper, Castle and Heath were already there. They held the doors open for the others and then slammed them shut and barred them once they were all inside. Half of the men dropped to their knees and struggled to catch their breath. The remaining three realised immediately that there were suddenly movements in the shadows all around them. Within thirty seconds some fifteen ragged figures had appeared in the building\u0027s vast reception area. Countless more slammed into the door and began to try and beat their way inside. \u0027Get rid of them,\u0027 Cooper ordered. \u0027Go for the head and try and take them out. We\u0027ll get this area cleared and then we can slow it down a gear.\u0027 Looking round for inspiration he picked up a nearby metal tube (which had previously held up a sign instructing visitors to the court to wait to be searched by security) and moved towards the closest body. What had once been a policewoman dragged itself towards him with willowy arms outstretched. He swung the heavy metal tube through the air and smashed it into the side of the corpse\u0027s head. Deep crimson blood, almost black, began to ooze steadily from a gash above the body\u0027s shattered cheekbone. It moved forward again. Cooper lashed out again and again, his fifth strike finally making the pitiful creature crumble, leaving it limp and motionless on the dusty marble floor. Armitage stood in numb terror as an elderly cadaver stumbled towards him. With empty, emotionless eyes it stared at him and he found himself unable to look away or to react in any other way. Suddenly too close to be avoided, the lorry driver screwed up his face in disgust and lifted his arms to prevent the pathetic figure from advancing any further forward. Although the body squirmed relentlessly in his grip, the survivor\u0027s strength was clearly too much for it to overcome. Becoming suddenly more confident now that he was aware of the physical gulf between the living and the dead, Armitage pushed the body away and into the nearest wall with angry force. The corpse stopped and then turned and began to move towards him again. This time Armitage grabbed hold of the rotting head, just below the chin, and, with weeks of pent up fear and frustration behind him, he slammed it against the wall, almost crushing it completely. They were cutting through the bodies with incredible ease. The lethargic movements, slow reactions and comparative weakness of the cadavers was no match for the strength and coordination of even the most tired and unfit survivor. In less than five minutes the reception area had been cleared. \u0027Good job,\u0027 Croft said. He was breathing heavily. Paul Castle acknowledged their efforts. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he gasped, clearly surprised, \u0027they were nothing, were they? Christ we could have torn a thousand of them apart...\u0027 \u0027But there are millions out there,\u0027 Bernard Heath reminded him. The university lecturer\u0027s voice was solemn and resigned. \u0027Don\u0027t think that\u0027s it,\u0027 Cooper said. \u0027 There will be more of them around the building. Just keep moving and don\u0027t let your guard down.\u0027 With that he began to move towards a nearby corridor. \u0027Where you going?\u0027 asked Armitage, wiping his grease and gore-covered hands on the back of his trousers. Cooper gestured towards a brass sign on the wall. \u0027Juror\u0027s suite,\u0027 he replied. His answer was met with blank looks from the others. \u0027Jurors sit in on trials,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Trials happen in court rooms. Prisoners stand in the dock in court rooms...\u0027 \u0027And...?\u0027 pressed Castle. \u0027And the prisoners have to get from the prison vans to the dock, don\u0027t they? We\u0027ll work our way back through the building.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-38.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
