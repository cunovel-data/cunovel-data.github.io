{"id":112084,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Holmes drove the car the wrong way down the ring road, swerving around meandering bodies and avoiding the abandoned wrecks of other crashed vehicles. Slamming on the brake, he took a sharp right turn and followed a narrow service road between two grey university buildings and down around the back of the accommodation block. The number of bodies on the far side of the complex was considerably fewer. Clare looked up and saw people watching from the first floor windows of the large red-brick building. Holmes parked the car on a grass verge a short distance away from the block, close to an enclosed artificial turf football pitch. In silence the four survivors quickly clambered out and grabbed as many bags and boxes as they could carry from the boot of the blood-soaked vehicle. Struggling with their loads and following Bernard Heath\u0027s lead they half-ran, half-walked towards an inconspicuous blue door which was being held open by another survivor. Holmes ran back to the car after dumping his first load of supplies indoors, not about to leave behind his precious beer outside after he\u0027d risked so much to get it.\n He slammed the boot of the car shut and turned and scrambled back to the safety of the building, disappearing inside and pulling the door shut just seconds before the first of five approaching bodies could reach him. \u0027We\u0027ll come back for this lot later,\u0027 said Heath as he dropped another carrier bag on the large pile of supplies. \u0027I need a rest first.\u0027 Jack stayed close to Heath as they walked deeper into the bowels of the building. It was dark, cold and quiet inside but it still felt safe and strangely welcoming. The surroundings didn\u0027t matter, he decided. All that he cared about was stopping still for a while and being with other people again. \u0027How many people did you say are here?\u0027 Jack asked. He\u0027d already been told once but so much had happened so quickly that he hadn\u0027t been able to take everything in. Less than an hour ago he\u0027d been sat in the remains of the department store with Clare. Until then she\u0027d been the only other living person he\u0027d seen. \u0027Forty or so, I think,\u0027 Heath replied. \u0027I\u0027m not really sure. This whole part of the complex was mainly student accommodation. There are a few hundred individual rooms here and so far most people seem to be keeping themselves to themselves. Lots of them just found themselves a room and shut the door behind them and no-one\u0027s seen them since. There are a few of us who have started to spend time together and try and get things sorted out but there are many more who prefer to be alone.\u0027\n Leading the group through the building was a tall, willowy man named Keith Peterson. With his long hair in an untidy ponytail and wearing several layers of loose, warm clothing he looked as scruffy and unkempt as any of the corpses roaming outside. His face was pale and drained of emotion. He hadn\u0027t smiled, spoken or even raised an eyebrow when the car had returned with an additional two passengers. Jack attempted to catch his eye in an attempt to at least try and make contact but it was obvious that Peterson wasn\u0027t interested. The fact of the matter was that he, like just about everyone else, was struggling to make sense of the illogical hell that his previously structured and normal life had suddenly become. They climbed a short staircase which led up to the main part of the ground floor. As they climbed the light increased. Jack and Clare looked from side to side as they were led across a wide, glass-fronted reception area. Tightly packed bodies were pressed against every available square inch of glass, being forced forward by more and more of the sickly creatures that were slowly dragging themselves out of the city towards the university. The rest of the world had become painfully silent. The noise that the group of survivors made - no matter how slight and insignificant it seemed - was enough to attract the unwanted attention of the dead hordes. And the reaction of the nearest bodies to that noise as they smashed and crashed against the glass frequently resulted in sudden frenzied activity spreading through the masses with startling rapidity. In turn that activity attracted more and more of them. \u0027See that lot,\u0027 Heath said quietly, gesturing towards the bodies, \u0027started gathering here late last night.\n They seem to be able to hear us now.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Jack replied, \u0027we found out this morning.\u0027 \u0027God alone knows what\u0027s going on, but if they can hear us and see us today, what are they going to be able to do tomorrow? That\u0027s why a few of us have been out for supplies. I think we\u0027re going to batten down the hatches for a while.\u0027 Clare was relieved when they turned right and began to walk down a darker, windowless corridor. At the end of the corridor was the entrance to a large assembly hall. Her eyes widened as they entered and as she saw that there were people scattered all around the edge of the room - living, breathing people, not empty shells like the pitiful things outside. The hall was generally quiet but now and then an occasional whispered conversation would quickly begin and then end with equal speed. The only constant noise came from a couple of very young children playing together in the furthest corner, blissfully ignorant to the pain and fear so obviously consuming everyone else. In keeping with Keith Peterson\u0027s lack of interest in the new arrivals, every other survivor they passed also showed complete disinterest towards them. Most of them stared into space. One man was lying on his side on the floor, covered by a grey blanket and rocking steadily. His dark eyes were wide open like saucers. Clare thought to herself that he looked too afraid to shut them. After diagonally crossing the room Peterson took them outside through a fire escape and then walked through a small concrete courtyard towards another door. There were a few more people outside. An older woman sitting on a wooden bench wrapped in a thick overcoat nodded and managed half a smile at Clare as she followed the others through.\n \u0027These are the rooms we\u0027re using,\u0027 Heath explained as they reached another connected part of the building. It looked and smelled much newer than the rest of the site. More flights of stairs and then they followed a long and narrow corridor with numerous small bedrooms running off on either side. \u0027Those of us who were here on the first day cleared the whole place,\u0027 he continued, slightly breathless. \u0027You won\u0027t find any bodies in here. Fortunately term hadn\u0027t started so there weren\u0027t many people around, just a few of the overseas students who had come back early.\u0027 Peterson stopped walking. He turned round to face Clare and Jack and, for the first time, spoke. \u0027Most of us are on this floor,\u0027 he mumbled, his voice flat and monotone. \u0027Find yourselves an empty room. I suggest you stay on this side,\u0027 he said, nodding his head to the left. \u0027The other side overlooks the city. There are thousands of those bodies out there. We\u0027re trying to keep out of sight as much as we can.\u0027 Jack nodded in appreciation as the thin, lifeless man walked back in the direction from which they had just come and then disappeared. Heath watched him go before speaking again. \u0027Get yourself settled,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027I\u0027m going back to the hall. Come down when you\u0027re ready and we\u0027ll get you something to eat.\u0027\n \u0027We really appreciate this,\u0027 Jack said suddenly, his voice filling with very obvious and yet wholly unexpected emotion. \u0027I didn\u0027t think we were going to find anyone else who...\u0027 Heath smiled and rested a reassuring hand on the other man\u0027s shoulder. \u0027It\u0027s not a problem. I know exactly how you\u0027re feeling,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027As does just about every other poor bastard unfortunate enough to be stuck here.\u0027 The lecturer paused for a moment and thought carefully, as if he was poised to say something of great significance. But the words wouldn\u0027t come. Instead he turned and began to walk back down the corridor, tired and in need of rest. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Clare said. \u0027I don\u0027t know...\u0027 Her words were abruptly truncated by a sudden scream of pain from somewhere else in the building. It seemed to be coming from somewhere on the floor above them. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 cursed Jack. \u0027What the was that?\u0027 \u0027Nothing to worry about,\u0027 Heath explained, turning back around to face the other two. \u0027We\u0027ve got a lady upstairs who\u0027s going to have a baby within the next couple of days. The doctor reckons it might even be born before the day\u0027s out.\u0027 Another scream. Jack looked down at Clare, concerned that the woman\u0027s noise would upset the teenager. \u0027Jesus,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027What a time to have to go through that.\n I mean, it\u0027s enough of an ordeal at the best of times, but now...?\u0027 Jack let his words trail quietly away. \u0027I know,\u0027 said Heath. \u0027Look, I\u0027m going to leave you to it. I\u0027ll see you both later, okay?\u0027 With that he was gone. Jack and Clare were alone. \u0027You okay?\u0027 Jack asked. \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 she replied. \u0027You?\u0027 He nodded. \u0027I\u0027m fine. Let\u0027s get these rooms sorted out.\u0027 The rooms were small and compact but practical and more than sufficient compared to the department store where they\u0027d spent the previous night. A narrow bed, a wardrobe, a couple of small cabinets, a desk, two chairs and a sink were all they contained but that was more than enough. They managed to find adjacent rooms two-thirds of the way down the corridor. Jack left his rucksack on the end of the bed, not bothering to empty its contents. There didn\u0027t seem to be much point. Although the accommodation block seemed to be a remarkably safe and sensible place for them to shelter and hide in, he didn\u0027t dare think that they might actually be able to stay there for any length of time. The world was full of so much uncertainty and fear that nothing could be taken for granted.\n As more screams echoed through the building Clare sat down on a hard plastic chair by the window in her room and held her head in her hands. She felt ready to burst into tears but her emotions were not forthcoming. The relentless pressure of their bizarre situation seemed to be acting as a kind of stopper, preventing her from outwardly showing how she was really feeling. The room was cold and clinical and her sense of bewilderment and unfamiliarity was overpowering. It was only when she thought about her parents and everything else she had lost that she finally began to cry freely. After just over ten minutes had passed Jack left his room and walked across the corridor to the room directly opposite.\n The panoramic view over the city from the window was, for a few seconds at least, impressive. But then, as his curiosity took hold, he allowed his eyes to wander down to street level. An massive crowd of diseased, staggering bodies surrounded the front of the building. And with the rest of the city appearing to be completely lifeless, he could see more and more of them dragging themselves out of the shadows continually.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-12.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
