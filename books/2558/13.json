{"id":112085,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"By the time the city was bathed in darkness again Donna and Paul had decided what they were going to do. They planned to distract the bodies on the landing as they\u0027d discussed earlier and then make a break for it. They hoped that their comparative strength and control would be enough to get them through the crowd outside the office doors. As the afternoon and early evening had worn on their simple plan had slowly gained more purpose and direction. There was no question that they were doing the right thing. For the first time in days both of them could see a reason to try and do something positive, and they were both acutely aware of the fact that they had to do it quickly. In the gloom of the dying day Donna had gathered her few belongings together and put on as much of the clothing she\u0027d collected as was comfortable. The evening was bitterly cold. Even indoors her breath condensed in cool, billowing clouds around her mouth and nose. Across the room, still keeping low and out of sight, Paul had done the same with his things.\n The lamps around the office floor remained dull and unlit, the survivors electing to remain in darkness until they were completely ready to make their move. \u0027We need to stir them up at the other end of the room,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027We\u0027ll use the lamps and we\u0027ll make enough of a disturbance so that they try and get in through those doors.\u0027 \u0027And then we come back to this end?\u0027 Paul asked anxiously. He knew full well what they were going to do. They\u0027d been planning it for hours. Going over the plan again and again seemed to help both of them. Donna nodded. \u0027We\u0027ll prop the doors open up there and let them get inside. We\u0027ll get ourselves back down here and wait for a couple of minutes until the bulk of them are in. Then we\u0027ll get out.\n They\u0027ll follow each other like sheep.\u0027 \u0027You sure?\u0027 \u0027Sure as I can be. Only one way of finding out for certain though, isn\u0027t there?\u0027 Paul nodded nervously. He knew exactly what she meant. He also knew that it wouldn\u0027t be long now before they left the comparative safety of the office and stepped out into the unknown. He continued to go over the plan again and again in his head. It seemed to make sense and he couldn\u0027t think of any alternative. He knew in his heart that it was going to work, but as the minutes slowly ticked by and the inevitable approached he began to doubt himself. \u0027Make yourself useful,\u0027 Donna said, snapping him out of his daydream. \u0027Let\u0027s start getting the lamps together.\u0027 She turned and walked out of the training room, leaving Paul sitting alone in the darkness. For a few seconds he stayed exactly where he was, suddenly too afraid to move. It didn\u0027t matter how long they\u0027d talked about doing this, now that the time to act had actually arrived he wanted to curl up again and hide. Sensing that he hadn\u0027t followed her, Donna turned back. \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 she hissed. His mouth was dry and he couldn\u0027t answer. \u0027I...\u0027 he began, not knowing what he was trying to say. \u0027Get off your backside and fucking move!\u0027 Donna cursed. She waited for a second but still he didn\u0027t move. \u0027Now!\u0027 she yelled. Paul scrambled to his feet, suddenly feeling pathetic and ashamed but no less frightened and unsure than he had been. Donna\u0027s voice also provoked frantic activity out on the landing as the bodies again began to batter against the doors, trying hopelessly to force their way inside. The two survivors quickly made their way around the perimeter of the office, collecting the torches and lamps which Donna had placed there the previous evening. They then assembled them on a single desk in the furthest corner of the room, in full sight of the bodies behind the door. \u0027Got everything?\u0027 she asked. Paul swallowed hard. \u0027Think so,\u0027 he mumbled nervously, realising that they would be making their move within minutes. \u0027Good,\u0027 she replied. She started to light the lamps and torches but stopped after only lighting four. The creatures outside were banging on the door again with even more force. Their simple, basic interests already aroused by the sound of Donna\u0027s voice moments earlier, the bright light in the corner of the room now seemed to be enough to drive them into a frenzy. She glanced over her shoulder at the movement outside. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Paul moaned. \u0027Christ, what the hell are we doing?\u0027 \u0027What we have to do,\u0027 Donna grunted, returning her attention to the lamps. \u0027Now shut up and get on with it.\u0027\n With his hands shaking with nerves Paul lit a match and began to light the gas lamps. The room was quickly filled with more light and with the faintly acidic smell and dull roar of burning jets of gas. The noise on the landing became even louder. \u0027Shit,\u0027 Paul cursed, \u0027listen to them. All we\u0027ve done is light a few lamps and the bloody things are going mad.\u0027 \u0027Good, that\u0027s exactly what we want.\u0027 \u0027Is it?\u0027 \u0027Of course it is. The more fired up they are, the better a distraction this is going to be.\u0027 Paul wasn\u0027t convinced. He returned his attention to lighting the remaining lamps, trying unsuccessfully to blank out the noise coming from outside. A couple of minutes later and it was done. The far right corner of the office was filled with bright light and a sudden warmth. \u0027Okay,\u0027 Donna whispered, stepping back into the shadows again, \u0027let\u0027s go.\u0027 Paul instinctively began to backtrack. \u0027You\u0027re completely sure about this?\u0027 he mumbled, his mouth dry. \u0027But what happens if we get out there and...?\u0027 She turned and stared at him, her face harshly illuminated from the right. The anger in her face was blindingly apparent. \u0027Just stop your damn whining and move,\u0027 she seethed. \u0027It\u0027s too late to back out now. Get back to the other end and get the bags ready.\u0027 Relieved to be away from the revealing light he walked quickly away to the far end of the office. \u0027And keep out of sight,\u0027 she shouted after him. \u0027Don\u0027t let them see you. You screw this up and we\u0027re trapped.\u0027 He didn\u0027t need her to tell him that, it was painfully obvious. Their actions were geared around the basic fact that there was only one way for them to get out of the building. If their escape route became blocked for any reason then that would be it. There would be no second chances. Breathing deeply to try and calm her own shattered nerves, Donna cautiously walked away from the light and moved closer towards the doors. Through the small glass panels she could see the creatures outside reacting to her presence. The ferocity of their movements increased as she approached - she could see the reaction of the first bodies causing the second and the third to react, then the forth, the fifth and the sixth and so on until the landing was filled with clumsy, awkward movement and action. She wondered what, if anything, was going through their decaying minds? Were they frightened of her? Did they want to harm her? Did they want her to help end their suffering? Whatever the reason she knew that ultimately it didn\u0027t matter. Self-preservation was all that was important now. She took a deep breath and opened the door. For a split-second there was nothing.\n Then the force of the mass of bodies on the landing and stairs caused the crowd to surge forward, spilling into the office and sending countless corpses stumbling and tripping around her. The brightness of the light in the corner of the room was more of a distraction than she was. In the relative darkness she was able to turn and run back to the training room. \u0027Okay?\u0027 Paul whispered. \u0027Shut up,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Keep quiet. If they hear us they\u0027ll start coming up this way.\u0027 The two survivors crept quietly out of the training room and towards the other doors. Down at the far end of the office they could see a huge mass of dark, uncoordinated bodies continuing to flood into the room and head for the light. The first few of them reached out with cold, lifeless hands and grabbed inquisitively at the lamps. Unable to grip with clumsy, uncoordinated fingers and thumbs, one of the creatures knocked a lamp to the ground, shattering its protective glass cover and leaving the burning mantle exposed. Within seconds the carpet and a pile of papers was alight. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Donna gasped as she watched the fire spread quickly. \u0027Let\u0027s get moving.\u0027 \u0027No, hold on. We should give it a little longer.\u0027 Donna moved forward just enough to enable her to see through the doors and watch the bodies continuing to enter the office through the other entrance. Still more of them dragged themselves up the stairs and onto the landing. Paul watched the bodies around the light, which had now changed from a steady white-yellow to a flickering orange-red as the unchecked fire took hold. Some of the pitiful creatures walked into the flames, apparently ignorant to the heat and danger. Their ragged clothes were tinder dry and quickly began to smoulder and burn. \u0027We\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 Paul insisted. \u0027Christ, that fire\u0027s going to spread through this whole building. And when the gas bottles on the lamps start to go...\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Donna interrupted, standing up straight and picking up her few belongings. She watched the crowd through the door for a moment longer before stepping back to look at the fire. Several bodies were burning (and still moving) now, as was a desk and chair. Thick brown smoke was billowing up and was beginning to roll along the low ceiling towards them. Donna flicked her security pass casually at the control panel at the side of the door and then quietly pushed it open. Even now after the bodies had been able to get into the room for several minutes there were still more of them on the landing, tripping towards the open office doors. She looked back momentarily to check that Paul was with her and then led him out towards the staircase. Silently they crept along the landing with their backs pressed against the wall, terrified that they would be seen by the diseased hordes which continued to crowd towards the light. Donna stopped just short of the open door which led out onto the staircase. \u0027Okay?\u0027 she mouthed silently. Paul nodded. \u0027Just keep moving forward until we get outside.\u0027 After waiting for another withered body to drag itself through the doorway Donna turned and forced her way out onto the stairs. She tripped down in the darkness, pushing random bodies to the side as she began to run down towards ground level and deflecting countless grabbing hands which reached out for her constantly. The heavy footsteps of the survivors on the concrete stairs echoed throughout the dead building as they ran down and down, turning one hundred and eighty degrees at the foot of each short flight and the start of the next. Numerous bodies continued to emerge from the darkness around them but the sheer strength, speed and fear of Donna and Paul was too much for any of the cadavers. They were knocked away and flung to the side like discarded rag dolls.\n Through another door and they had reached the reception area. Still more dark and indistinguishable bodies approached but the survivors did not allow themselves to be distracted. Donna led Paul down a final staircase and out into the office car park through an insignificant basement entrance. The car park was empty. In the safety of the shadows and the darkness they stopped. \u0027You all right?\u0027 Paul asked quietly. Donna nodded, shaking and breathing heavily. \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she replied. \u0027You?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m fine.\u0027 Disturbed by a huge noise from above, Donna took a few steps out into the centre of the car park and looked up. She could see the floor from which they had just escaped. The windows along two-thirds of the length of the building were lit up, illuminated by fierce yellow-orange flames. Even from where they stood, many meters below, they could hear the crackle and pop of the fire as it consumed the office. The sudden muffled bang of an exploding gas cylinder and the cracking of glass made them both catch their breath. Without saying another word, and walking slowly for fear of attracting the attention of the sickly, withered bodies soon moving randomly around them again, Paul and Donna left the car park and began to head towards the centre of the city. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-13.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
