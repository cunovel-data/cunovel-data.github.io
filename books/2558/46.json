{"id":112117,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"Standing in silence in the window of a first floor bedroom, Nathan Holmes and Steve Richards watched the convoy of survivors disappear into the night. \u0027They\u0027re bloody idiots,\u0027 Holmes said. \u0027They\u0027re wasting their time.\u0027 Richards didn\u0027t respond. He was crying. Holmes glanced over his shoulder and looked at the other man momentarily before turning back to look out of the window again. To his left he could see the fading taillights of the trucks and the van. Hundreds of staggering bodies followed pointlessly in the wake of the vehicles. To his right the huge blaze at the other end of the university complex was continuing to draw thousands upon thousands of cadavers to the scene.\n He glanced back at Richards again. \u0027Okay, mate, you ready?\u0027 he asked. Richards nodded and sniffed. \u0027Going to be a good night, this is.\u0027 Holmes picked up an outdoor jacket which he had left hanging on the back of a nearby chair. He put the jacket on and did up the zip. Still crying, Richards pulled on a warm fleece. \u0027Sure you\u0027re up for this?\u0027 Richards nodded again. The two men left the room and walked down the dark and silent corridor to the staircase. Together, they then made their way down to the ground floor. They stopped at an inconspicuous window in the corner of a similarly dark and inconspicuous room. Holmes turned to face Richards. \u0027Pub or club?\u0027 he asked. Richards managed half a smile. \u0027Start with a pub. We can always go on to a club later.\u0027 \u0027The Crown or The Lazy Fox?\u0027 Richards thought for a moment.\n \u0027The Crown. It\u0027s closer.\u0027 Grinning, Holmes leant forward and gently teased open the window in front of them. After peering up and down along the outside wall of the building momentarily he climbed up onto the windowsill and jumped down into the middle of an overgrown flower bed. Richards followed close behind. Filled with fear and nerves, and knowing that this was most probably to be his last night alive, he stopped walking and began to cry again. \u0027Think about it this way,\u0027 Holmes soothed, \u0027those idiots that left here tonight, they\u0027ve got nothing left to look forward to except more grief. You and me, mate, we\u0027ve got it made. It\u0027s going to get harder and harder for the rest of them. It\u0027s going to get easier for us.\u0027 Holmes crept forward until he reached the edge of a narrow pathway. \u0027Nathan, I...\u0027 Richards began. \u0027Trust me,\u0027 Holmes interrupted. With that he turned and began to jog away from the university. Richards followed close behind, breaking into a sprint as Holmes did the same, afraid that he was going to be left behind.\n The two men emerged from a narrow side street onto a section of the ring road which was swarming with bodies. As the number of bodies around him increased, so Holmes moved with a nervous urgency, pushing his way through the rancid crowds. Driven by a combination of terror and disgust, Richards matched his speed, smashing corpse after corpse out of his way. After reaching the far side of the carriageway, Holmes turned left into another wide and silent street and headed for the shadowy remains of The Crown public house, a large pub which occupied a prominent position on the corner of two once busy main roads. Panting with exhaustion from the sudden sprint, he crashed through the swinging entrance door, followed seconds later by Richards. \u0027Okay?\u0027 he asked. Richards was bent over double with his hands on his knees, fighting to catch his breath.\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 he replied. The now familiar dull thud of bodies smashing against the outside of the door made the two men look up. Holmes immediately began to pile tables, chairs, cigarette machines and anything else he could find in front of the entrance to prevent the odious corpses from forcing their way inside. Richards walked deeper into the building. The pub was empty. It had been closed when the disaster had happened.\n \u0027What are you drinking?\u0027 he asked as he walked around to the back of the bar. \u0027Anything you can lay your hands on,\u0027 Holmes replied as he finished blocking the door. He peered through a gap in the mountain of furniture he had just created and watched as the sickly cadavers in the street tried hopelessly to force their way into the building. As Richards busied himself behind the bar Holmes dragged two leather armchairs across the room and set them in front of a fireplace, one on either side. He smashed a table and stool and built up a fire in the hearth with the splintered wood. Richards carried several bottles of spirits over and sat down. He poured them both a drink. \u0027Cigar?\u0027 Holmes asked, disappearing across the room and grabbing a handful of cigars and boxes of matches from a display at the back of the bar.\n \u0027I don\u0027t smoke,\u0027 Richards sighed. \u0027You should start,\u0027 Holmes grinned. \u0027Last chance, mate.\u0027 Richards helped himself to a single cigar, took off the cellophane wrapper and lit it. After lighting the fire using bar towels soaked in whiskey as a fuse, Holmes did the same.\n The two men sat back in the dull orange glow and began to drink. \u0027This is as good as it\u0027s going to get,\u0027 Holmes said quietly, his voice drained of the antagonism and venom that had been so prevalent during the previous days and weeks. \u0027All you have to do now,\u0027 he continued, \u0027is drink and smoke and relax. Make sure you drink enough because they\u0027re going to get in at some point. And if we manage to make it to the morning, we\u0027ll just drink some more.\u0027 Richards was crying again. The drink quickly began to take the edge off the pain. \u0027Bloody hell, they\u0027re already at the windows,\u0027 he said.\n Holmes looked up and saw that there were countless shadowy shapes swarming on the other side of the glass. He could still hear the bodies clattering and banging against the front door. If the noise didn\u0027t attract them, he thought, the light from the fire certainly would. \u0027Drink up,\u0027 he said, \u0027and think yourself lucky. Tonight everyone else is either dead or on the run. We\u0027re in the best place we could be.\u0027 Richards didn\u0027t know if he agreed. The more he drank, however, the more he realised he didn\u0027t care. It took just over an hour for the crowd outside to build to such a size that sheer pressure forced them inside.\n A street level window behind and to the right of Holmes and Richards smashed sending a thousand shards of glass and a hundred bodies spilling into the pub. Already too drunk to react or fight, the two men sat in their chairs and continued to drink as the building filled with rotting flesh. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-46.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
