Faint and tinny, for the first time in almost a week he could definitely hear music. Once he was fully awake it took him a couple of seconds to get his bearings. He looked around and let his eyes slowly become accustomed to the low morning light. The department store looked very different in daylight - completely different in fact to how he\u0027d pictured it last night when it had been filled with nothing but shadows and darkness. He then remembered that he hadn\u0027t been alone last night and he sat up quickly and looked around for Clare. \u0027Over here,\u0027 she shouted from the other side of the store. She\u0027d been watching him stirring for the last couple of minutes but hadn\u0027t wanted to wake him. Stiff, aching and tired, Jack swung his legs out over the side of the bed, got up and then slowly shuffled over to the dining room furniture display where she was sitting. He sat down opposite her at a large mahogany table. In the middle of the table was a small stereo unit. Clare was playing a CD.\n He didn\u0027t recognise the music. Although he didn\u0027t say anything to her he wished she\u0027d turn it down. It wasn\u0027t particularly loud, he decided it just seemed that way because everything else was so deathly silent. \u0027How are you this morning?\u0027 he asked. She nodded and smiled sadly. \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she replied. \u0027Look, I didn\u0027t mean to wake you up. I hope you don\u0027t mind the noise. I couldn\u0027t stand the quiet any longer. I found the stereo in the electrical department just past the beds.\u0027 Jack looked back over his shoulder and noticed a huge bank of dead television screens a short distance behind the row of beds where they\u0027d just spent the night. Still drugged by sleep he stood up again and walked back to where he\u0027d left their belongings last night. After searching through his rucksack he found a little of the food which he\u0027d brought with him. He took it back to Clare and sat down again. \u0027Hungry?\u0027 he asked. She shook her head. \u0027Not really.\u0027 \u0027You should try and eat something. We both should.\u0027 He opened up a plastic lunch box and took out some chocolate and fruit which he laid out on the table between them. Clare took a chocolate bar and unwrapped it.\n It was surprisingly good. The rich taste and smell of the food was reassuringly familiar and strangely comforting. She\u0027d hardly eaten since Tuesday. After days of feeling nothing much more than sickening hurt and constant disorientation, the food provided a welcome distraction. For a moment it seemed that although they appeared to have lost everything, there was a slight chance that it might be possible for them to rediscover something resembling normality amongst the rubble of what remained of the lives they used to lead. \u0027I love this song,\u0027 Clare said as the next track on the CD began. She chewed thoughtfully on her chocolate and turned up the volume. She closed her eyes and for a precious few seconds tried to imagine she was somewhere else. To Jack the music sounded no different and no less processed and manufactured than the last bland track he\u0027d heard. He remembered the days when music was played by real musicians and when talent mattered more than appearance and... and he could hear something else. He slammed his fist down on top of the stereo and stopped it playing. \u0027Hey...\u0027 Clare protested. \u0027Shh...\u0027 he hissed. He pushed his chair back and walked towards the escalators which snaked up through the centre of the department store.\n He could hear movement on the first floor below. Cautiously he peered over the top of the staircase and saw that a crowd of bodies had appeared. Unlike the clumsy bodies he\u0027d seen earlier, these seemed to have a modicum of control. The light was poor but he could see, incredibly, that two or three of them had begun trying to climb up the motionless escalator towards him. They tripped over shop displays and random fallen corpses as they tried awkwardly to move forward. Clare suddenly appeared at his side, startling him. \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 she asked anxiously. \u0027Look,\u0027 he answered, nodding down in the direction of the figures beneath them. He concentrated his attention on the diseased body which had made most progress towards the second floor.\n It was now almost halfway up the escalator but had been forced to stop, its way ahead blocked by an upturned baby\u0027s pushchair. Although it had been considerably darker last night it had been fairly easy for Jack and Clare to negotiate their way around such obstacles. The stilted movements of the desperate creatures below were nowhere near as controlled and precise as those of the survivors. As they crouched in silence in the shadows and watched, the crowd below them began to dissipate. Those bodies on the outside of the gathering were beginning to trip and stumble away. \u0027Was it the music?\u0027 Clare wondered.\n The corpses on the escalator seemed to be losing interest now. They were staggering back down to the first floor again. \u0027Must have been.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 \u0027Well yesterday and the day before I spent ages shouting for help and they didn\u0027t react then. I didn\u0027t think they could hear us.\u0027 Jack thought about what she\u0027d said. She was right. He remembered the first moving body that he\u0027d come across - the woman in the street outside his house. He\u0027d run towards her breathlessly but she hadn\u0027t reacted. The rest of the world had been quiet and there had been no other distractions that he\u0027d been aware of. Surely the woman would have heard him approaching if she\u0027d been able to? Clare moved around Jack and took a couple of steps down the escalator. \u0027Where you going?\u0027 he hissed, concerned. At the raised volume of his voice the nearest body stopped moving and slowly turned back around again to face the survivors. Both Clare and Jack froze and hoped that they would merge into the shadows and not be seen. The body continued down the escalator.\n Reaching over to one side, Clare wrestled a handbag free from the grip of an old woman whose lifeless corpse was sprawled across the escalator. She threw the bag down to the first floor, past the few remaining bodies and into a greetings card display.\n The display rattled and crashed to the floor and, almost instantly, the bodies returned. The survivors watched with increasing fear and uncertainty as the dead gathering regrouped around the sudden distraction. Clare turned and ran back towards Jack, her footsteps echoing loudly on the metal steps beneath her. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 mumbled Jack as he watched the bodies react to the sound of Clare moving.\n The listless figures were converging at the bottom of the escalator again. She pushed past him and ran back over to the table where they\u0027d been eating just a few minutes earlier. Jack marched over to the beds, grabbed his bag and began frantically packing everything away. A familiarly sickening feeling of helplessness, panic and disorientation had suddenly returned. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 Clare asked, instinctively starting to gather up her own things. \u0027Getting out,\u0027 he replied in a hushed and frightened whisper. \u0027Getting away from those things.\u0027 \u0027But where are we going to go?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 Clare stopped and sat down at the table again. She held her head in her hands. \u0027They won\u0027t get up here, will they?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Jack answered. \u0027Give them enough time and they might. Who knows what they\u0027ll do?\u0027 \u0027But we can block the escalators off, can\u0027t we? We can use some of this furniture. They\u0027re never going to be strong enough to get through, are they?\u0027 Her simple logic stopped him in his tracks. He stopped packing and stared at her, struggling to answer.\n His throat was dry and he could feel beads of cold, nervous sweat running down his back. \u0027You might be right, but...\u0027 \u0027But what?\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t know for sure.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know anything really, do we?\u0027 Clare rubbed her eyes and started to mess with the food Jack had left on the table. \u0027I\u0027m scared,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027I don\u0027t want to go anywhere.\u0027 Jack put down his rucksack and collapsed on the end of his bed. She was right. What would they gain from running? The top floors of the department store seemed as safe a place to hide as any.\n A short time later Jack had calmed down enough to be able to creep quietly across the floor to the top of the escalator and look down again. He couldn\u0027t see any bodies. In the silence of the morning they had all drifted away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-9.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
