{"id":112114,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"Donna ran the length of the university complex with Clare following close behind. They quickly worked their way through a labyrinth of dark, featureless corridors, hoping that they would be able to remember the way back to the others. After several minutes of running Donna decided that they had gone far enough. \u0027This\u0027ll do,\u0027 she said breathlessly, slowing down to walking pace and resting her hands on her hips. \u0027Where are we going to do it?\u0027 asked Clare. Donna looked around. There was an exit door to her right. Through small, square, safety glass panels she could see a narrow concrete pathway which led to a detached storage building.\n \u0027Perfect,\u0027 she whispered as she carefully forced open the door and stepped out into the night. The pathway between the main university complex and the storage building was little over twenty meters long and, to Donna\u0027s relief, was also completely enclosed by other buildings and by sturdy security fences.\n For once she was happy to risk being out in the open. Apart from a single twisted and gnarled corpse lying motionless to the side of the path she couldn\u0027t see any bodies. The evening was rapidly drawing in and the light was disappearing quickly. Once she was satisfied that there were no signs of movement nearby she ran over to the second building and forced her way inside. Her eyes quickly became accustomed to the shadow and gloom as she looked around the cold and silent building. \u0027Sheets,\u0027 Clare hissed, pointing towards a metal rack on the far side of the room they found themselves standing in. She walked over and began to make a pile against the wall furthest from the door. Donna added a stack of papers and wooden furniture to the mound.\n \u0027That\u0027s enough,\u0027 she said quietly as she looked curiously into a second room. Obviously some kind of maintenance stores, the shelves on the long and narrow walls of the room were loaded with bottles, tubs and cartons of bleach, disinfectant and countless other chemicals used by cleaners and janitors. Clare instinctively backed up towards the main door as Donna reappeared and crouched down and struck a match which she used to set light to a pile of once important invoices and bills. The paper instantly began to smoulder and burn. She lit another match and did the same again a little further into the pile. The orange glow ate quickly into the tinder-dry paper and cloth and in less than a minute the room was filled with bright flickering light and whispy-grey smoke. The fire grew in size rapidly. Donna stepped back and stood still for a few seconds until she was sure that the blaze was properly established.\n She watched with satisfaction as the fire quickly ate through the linen and wood and then began to lick at nearby curtains and against the wall. The building would be completely ablaze in next to no time. \u0027Think this is going to work?\u0027 Clare asked. \u0027Should do,\u0027 Donna replied as she led the younger girl out of the building and down the path back towards the main university complex.\n As they walked she could hear the crackle and spit of the fire behind her and could see the reflection of tall, dancing flames in nearby windows. \u0027All we want is a distraction,\u0027 she continued. \u0027Just enough to get the attention of the bulk of the crowd and get them moving in this direction. As soon as they\u0027re away from the trucks we can think about trying to get out of here.\n \u0027They stood and watched for a minute longer before turning and running back to the others.\n Less than a quarter of an hour later the entire university complex was rocked by a sudden and unexpected explosion. Survivors dashed to the nearest window to see what had happened. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Nathan Holmes spat, \u0027what did you two set fire to?\u0027\n Clare shrugged her shoulders, almost embarrassed. Donna peered out into the darkness as a second, smaller explosion ripped through the night, rattling the frame of the window she was looking through. The blaze they\u0027d started in the storage building had been unchecked and it had only been a matter of time before the flames had reached something flammable. She had hoped it would happen. The bigger the distraction, the more chance they had of getting over to the trucks and getting away. \u0027Why don\u0027t you just shut up, Nathan?\u0027 she snapped. \u0027How can you criticise us? What were you doing while we were out? Fuck all as usual. What have you ever done to help round here?\u0027 \u0027Why should I help? What\u0027s the point?\u0027 Donna sighed and turned to face him. She stared into his wide, angry eyes. \u0027The point is,\u0027 she began, her voice trembling with rage, \u0027that we might still have a chance to get out of here with something. We might be able to get out of here before this whole place comes crashing down and...\u0027 \u0027But why? Why are you bothering?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ve talked about this a hundred times before...\u0027 \u0027But why are you bothering?\u0027 Holmes demanded again, his voice hoarse and cracked with emotion. \u0027Because I\u0027m not prepared to sit here and wait for...\u0027 she couldn\u0027t bring herself to finish the sentence. \u0027Wait for what?\u0027 \u0027Wait for the end. Wait for something to happen that\u0027s going to...\u0027 \u0027What you\u0027re doing,\u0027 Holmes said, taking a few steps closer to Donna, \u0027is running around and risking your lives like a bunch of fucking idiots. Whatever you do, none of it\u0027s going to make any difference. Get yourself out of this mess and you\u0027ll just end up in another fucking hole. It\u0027ll go on and on and on until...\u0027\n \u0027Just shut up,\u0027 Donna interrupted. \u0027There are frightened people listening to you. You\u0027re not helping the situation.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re creating the fucking situation! And I know there are frightened people in here because I\u0027m one of them.\u0027 Holmes\u0027 final comment stunned and silenced Donna and stopped her in her tracks. For the first time she could remember Nathan Holmes - the difficult, obnoxious, offensive and weak little man who had caused more than his fair share of ill-feeling and resentment within the group of survivors - was apparently being candid and honest. For the first time she could remember he seemed to be allowing his public image to drop and his true feelings be seen. Perhaps the realisation that the status quo had been challenged and that, no matter what he decided to do next, his situation was inevitably about to change had brought about this sudden and unexpected change of heart. Whatever the reason, Donna felt sick to her stomach because he had made her think. For a moment he had made her question what they were doing. Was there really any point in doing any of this?\n Outside in the back of the truck Baxter, Cooper and the others had heard the explosion too. Croft cautiously peered through one of the small, dark windows in the side of the prison van. \u0027Christ,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027What is it?\u0027 Armitage asked, immediately concerned. \u0027Fire,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Look, over on the far side of the university. Something\u0027s on fire.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 demanded Cooper, leaning over to his right and craning his neck to look out through another window.\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 said Heath, immediately fearing the worst. For a moment no-one spoke, each man privately contemplating what had happened and fearing the worst. Croft was the first to try and make sense of the situation. \u0027They\u0027ve started it on purpose, haven\u0027t they?\u0027 he said quietly, turning back around to face the others. \u0027They must have. I think that fire is close to the medical school. It\u0027s certainly nowhere near the part of the building we\u0027ve been using. They must have started it deliberately.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 The doctor sighed. \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious?\u0027 It clearly wasn\u0027t. \u0027Jesus, look at the bodies,\u0027 Baxter said excitedly as he moved to look out of a third window.\n \u0027They\u0027re moving.\u0027\n \u0027Of course they are,\u0027 Croft continued. \u0027They\u0027re distracting them so that we can get back inside.\u0027 The chain reaction that Donna had been counting on was slowly spreading through the rotting crowds which still surrounded the perimeter of the football pitch. As the corpses nearest to the fire and explosion had been drawn closer to the distraction, their reactions had moved like a ripple through water and their clumsy movements had attracted the attention of others. Slowly and awkwardly the entire diseased mass seemed to be staggering towards the searing heat and bright light at the far end of the university complex. \u0027Time to go,\u0027 Cooper hissed.\n \u0027We should give it a while,\u0027 Heath mumbled nervously. \u0027There are still hundreds of them around. If we go outside now we\u0027ll be...\u0027 \u0027Time to go,\u0027 the soldier repeated. \u0027They\u0027re moving away from us. We\u0027ll have an advantage if we\u0027re moving through them from behind. By the time they realise we\u0027re there we\u0027ll already have passed them.\u0027\n \u0027What are we going to do about the van?\u0027 Croft asked, remembering that he had parked it across the entrance to the pitch. \u0027Someone will have to stop,\u0027 Heath suggested. \u0027Two should stay, just in case,\u0027 added Cooper. \u0027I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 volunteered Armitage. \u0027I\u0027ll only slow you down. I\u0027m out of shape. I\u0027ve already done more running today than I have for years...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll stay here,\u0027 Paul Castle mumbled. Although unsure, the thought of staying outside with the van and the trucks seemed slightly preferable to going into the dark night unprotected. \u0027We\u0027ll move the van back,\u0027 Armitage said, \u0027and then block the exit again as soon as you\u0027re through, okay?\u0027 By the time the lorry driver had finished speaking Cooper was already out of the truck and on his way over towards the van. Croft handed Armitage the keys and followed the other man into the darkness.\n \u0027Back to the door we used this afternoon, okay?\u0027 Cooper reminded the others as they nervously grouped near to the remains of the mangled metal gate. Armitage climbed into the van and looked down at Croft, Cooper, Baxter and Heath. Baxter nodded for him to start the engine and he turned the key, sending a sudden splutter of noise and fumes into the cold night and causing more than a hundred bodies to turn and begin moving back towards the football pitch. Realising what was happening he slammed the van into reverse and skidded back a few meters to open up the exit. As soon as a large enough gap had been opened the four survivors ran forward into the darkness.\n Armitage drove forward and blocked the entrance off again. Still somewhat sluggish and clumsy, but now with undeniable control and intent, the corpses stumbled towards the van. The light was low and the comparative speed of the four survivors was such that the creatures were not aware of them until they were close. A half-naked cadaver lashed out at Croft and knocked him off balance momentarily as he pushed his way back towards the university. Bernard Heath, running with his shoulder dropped, charged body after body out of the way as he let his momentum carry him back to the shelter. The ground was wet and uneven, a combination of autumn mist and some earlier rain having left a layer of surface water almost everywhere. Cooper slipped and fell and, by the time he was back up on his feet again, six bodies were within a meter of him. He punched and kicked his way through them and continued on towards the building. He was the last one to reach the sheltered area where the waste bins were stored and where the door they\u0027d used earlier was. Croft was already there and had it open. He ushered the other men inside quickly. \u0027Get in,\u0027 he hissed. Cooper pushed past and listened with relief as the door slammed shut behind him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-43.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
