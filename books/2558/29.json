{"id":112100,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u0027So where the fucking hell did you come from?\u0027 Nathan Holmes spat as the exhausted soldier and the group of six survivors entered the assembly hall. There were several other people in the room. They each individually stopped what they were doing and stared at the unexpected arrival. \u0027We were based just outside the city. Look, is there any chance that I could get...\u0027 \u0027Was it you who was shooting yesterday?\u0027 Holmes interrupted. \u0027Not me personally, but...\u0027 \u0027And the engine we heard, that was you too?\u0027 Cooper nodded, exhausted. Much as he understood why it was happening, this sudden interrogation was the last thing he needed. \u0027That was us,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Us?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027So where are the others?\u0027 \u0027Back at the base I hope.\u0027 \u0027And why are you still here?\u0027 \u0027We got separated.\u0027 \u0027How come you can breathe? Are the others immune?\u0027 Cooper shook his head. \u0027Don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t know for sure. I only found out I was by chance. Look, could somebody please tell me exactly what happened here? I\u0027ve been...\u0027 \u0027Aren\u0027t you the one who should be telling us what\u0027s happened?\u0027 asked Donna. She walked across the room to stand directly between Holmes and the weary soldier. Cooper shrugged his shoulders. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he replied. \u0027None of us knew. We had a little information, but nothing...\u0027 \u0027What information?\u0027 Jack Baxter asked, moving closer. \u0027Like I say, no-one knew very much,\u0027 he explained. \u0027We were told there was a disease. We knew that it was widespread and that it had probably killed thousands but nothing like...\u0027 \u0027So where were you when it happened?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027If you didn\u0027t know that you were immune until you got here, where have you been hiding for the last few weeks? How come the rest of you didn\u0027t get infected?\u0027 \u0027We were in a bunker.\u0027 \u0027You want to be thankful you didn\u0027t see any of it,\u0027 Bernard Heath sighed, sitting down a short distance away. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I said you ought to be grateful you were underground when it happen,\u0027 he continued. \u0027It was more than thousands of people that died, it was millions of them. Bloody millions of them just dropping dead where they\u0027d been standing. Christ, I don\u0027t expect there\u0027s a thousand people left alive.\u0027 \u0027So what about the ones outside? Are they...?\u0027 Cooper let his words fade into silence. No matter what he\u0027d witnessed out on the streets, he couldn\u0027t bring himself to ask the impossible question which had played on his mind since he\u0027d first arrived in the city. \u0027They\u0027re dead,\u0027 Baxter answered. \u0027If I hadn\u0027t seen it myself I probably wouldn\u0027t believe it. They all died on the first morning. A couple of days later they started to move again.\u0027 \u0027But how could they...?\u0027 Cooper mumbled pointlessly. \u0027Don\u0027t know. Christ, we\u0027ve got a doctor here and he doesn\u0027t know either. No-one knows.\u0027 Phil Croft took Baxter\u0027s comment as his cue to become involved in the conversation. \u0027Your guess is as good as mine,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027No-one\u0027s ever seen anything like this before so there\u0027s no point asking me what\u0027s happened. Tell you the truth, there\u0027s no point even trying to work it out.\u0027 \u0027Do you know what did it?\u0027 asked Paulette, the large and relentlessly effervescent lady who had been hanging on every word of the difficult exchange, hoping for answers. Her normally bright and energetic voice was suddenly quiet and uncharacteristically serious and flat. Cooper shrugged his shoulders. \u0027No,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Heath protested, \u0027you must have some idea. Were we attacked? Was it an accident?\u0027 The soldier shook his weary head. \u0027I really don\u0027t know. It can\u0027t have been a missile attack because you\u0027d have seen or heard something. I\u0027d have heard something. We would have known if we were being attacked. We were trained to deal with that kind of situation.\u0027 \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m saying that this was different.\u0027 \u0027What about the speed of it?\u0027 Donna asked. \u0027I was nine floors up. I watched it move across the city. How could that have happened?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m starting to wonder whether it was already here,\u0027 Croft added. \u0027There\u0027s no way a disease or a virus could be carried on the wind that quickly, is there?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got no idea,\u0027 Cooper sighed. \u0027Look, I\u0027ve got no reason to hide anything from you. If I knew anything then I\u0027d tell you. Like I said, no-one that I was with seemed to know anything. There might be people somewhere who understand it all, but the officers in our base knew about as much as you do.\u0027 Weary, Cooper collapsed into the nearest chair. Donna handed him a bottle of water and pulled another chair across the floor to sit next to him. There was a look of intense concentration on her face. Much as she was interested in the superficial and relatively unimportant details that Paulette and probably many others wanted to hear from the soldier, she wanted answers to other questions from him. Already her mind was working frantically, analysing what he had so far said and wondering whether this stranger might be able to bring some safety and stability into their bizarre and dangerous world. He had, it seemed, arrived in the city from a protected oasis of relative normality. \u0027So how many of you were there?\u0027 she asked. Cooper drained the bottle of water dry and wiped his mouth and cleared his throat before responding. \u0027Where? How many of us were here yesterday or...?\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027In the base. How many of you were in the base?\u0027 \u0027Couple of hundred I think. I\u0027m not completely sure. Three hundred at the most.\u0027 \u0027Room for any more?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know. Could be.\u0027 \u0027And are there more bases?\u0027 He nodded. \u0027There were supposed to be more, but I don\u0027t know if anyone managed to get to them. I\u0027m not even sure where they are. There\u0027s bound to be one close to the capital.\u0027 \u0027You must have some idea.\u0027 \u0027Why? I didn\u0027t know where our base was until I was in it. Look, these are the kind of places you don\u0027t know you\u0027re reached until you\u0027re standing on top of them. I\u0027ve heard that some of these bunkers are in the middle of cities, others are more remote. Christ, you might have lived next door to one for the last ten years and not known anything about it. \u0027 Phil Croft sat down next to Donna. \u0027If we could get to your base,\u0027 he began, the tone of his voice tentative and uncertain, \u0027would you be able to get us inside?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re out of your fucking mind if you think I\u0027m burying myself underground with the fucking army,\u0027 Nathan Holmes hissed from a short distance away. \u0027Completely out of your fucking mind.\u0027 Croft shot a quick, disappointed glance in his direction and then turned back to face the solider again. \u0027Would they let us in?\u0027 he asked again. Cooper couldn\u0027t answer with any certainty. \u0027They might,\u0027 he said quietly, \u0027but on the other hand they might not. They might not let me back in. It depends if the decontamination process works, I suppose. I left the base but I never made it back, did I? The others that left with me might not have been able to get back inside. If they couldn\u0027t remove all traces of the disease then they\u0027d have left them on the surface. For all I know they might have let it in when we left. The whole bloody base might be dead by now.\u0027 \u0027What kind of protection did you have?\u0027 Donna asked. \u0027Inside or outside?\u0027 \u0027Outside.\u0027 \u0027Full body suits and the best breathing kits the government could buy,\u0027 he answered. \u0027So,\u0027 she continued, \u0027while you were away from the base you couldn\u0027t eat or drink or...?\u0027 \u0027Theoretically we could,\u0027 he interrupted, finishing her sentence for her. \u0027The suits were designed to let you eat and drink and get rid of waste but we didn\u0027t carry much in the way of supplies. We weren\u0027t intending to be above ground for too long.\u0027 \u0027What if those others can\u0027t get back into the base because their suit or their equipment\u0027s contaminated...?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ll have left them on the surface.\u0027 \u0027To die?\u0027 \u0027Suppose so.\u0027 \u0027And did you know that when they ordered you to go outside?\u0027 \u0027No-one said as much but it doesn\u0027t take a genius to work it out, does it?\u0027 \u0027No wonder you\u0027re not rushing to get back.\u0027 \u0027Part of the job,\u0027 Cooper mumbled nonchalantly. \u0027And are you still on duty?\u0027 Croft quipped. The soldier shook his head. \u0027I quit,\u0027 he said, deadpan. \u0027I quit the moment I found out I could breathe. You don\u0027t have to spend long out here to realise the whole planet\u0027s dead. I figured I might as well try and make the most of the little freedom I\u0027ve got left. They probably think I\u0027m dead anyway.\u0027 \u0027Might as well be,\u0027 muttered Holmes.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-29.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
