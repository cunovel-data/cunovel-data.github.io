We should get out and head back to the base with Cooper.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s there for us?\u0027 Bernard Heath asked anxiously. \u0027More than there is here,\u0027 she replied before returning her full attention to the scraps of food on her plate. \u0027Who says I\u0027m going back to the bloody base?\u0027 Cooper muttered to himself, just loud enough for the others to hear. Nine survivors sat together in semi-darkness and ate a scraped together meal in one of the university lecture rooms. The atmosphere throughout the building had changed noticeably since the soldier had arrived there earlier in the day. To many of the desperately frightened people gathered in the accommodation block his appearance had brought a faint glimmer of unexpected hope into their dark lives. To an equal number of others, however, his presence in the building had increased their unease and anxiety. Claustrophobic, monotonous and uncomfortable their world may well have become, but with the rest of the country lying in ruins around them, this was all they had left. The soldier\u0027s sudden unannounced and unexpected interference in their fragile existence was disproportionately unsettling. To make matters worse (if they possibly could get any worse) the noise and commotion that had accompanied Cooper\u0027s arrival had whipped the crowds of disease-ridden bodies outside into an unprecedented frenzy. Even now, many hours later, the creatures still fought to get closer to the building, banging hopelessly against exposed windows and doors with their rotting fists. \u0027Isn\u0027t it about time we started trying to make some decisions here?\u0027 Jack Baxter said suddenly, pushing away his plate of cold food and taking a swig from a can of drink. \u0027I mean,\u0027 he continued, \u0027we can\u0027t just sit here and wait indefinitely, can we?\u0027 \u0027We can if we want to,\u0027 Heath disagreed. \u0027It makes sense to sit tight and wait for...\u0027 \u0027Wait for what?\u0027 Donna wondered. Sitting in the chair next to Donna, Clare looked from face to face in the low light. First Heath, then Baxter, then Cooper, then Donna and then back to Heath again. She waited for him to say something. In the gloom he looked haggard, old and weary as if he was carrying the weight of everyone\u0027s problems on his shoulders. She sensed that he was struggling to keep himself calm and controlled. She could see fear in his eyes. \u0027What I mean is...\u0027 he stammered. It was obvious that he didn\u0027t know what he meant. \u0027What are you planning to wait for?\u0027 Donna asked again. \u0027What exactly are you expecting to happen?\u0027 Obviously uncomfortable and wishing he\u0027d stayed quiet, Heath played with his food and picked up a paper towel which he screwed into a tight ball before throwing it into a nearby waste bin. He sank back in his chair and looked up for inspiration but nothing came. \u0027Don\u0027t know...\u0027 he finally admitted. \u0027Something\u0027s got to give eventually, hasn\u0027t it?\u0027 Baxter said. \u0027Like what?\u0027 asked Cooper. \u0027Well, things can\u0027t stay like this forever, can they? Nothing ever stays the same for too long. I mean, you turned up here today, didn\u0027t you? There will be more like you and...\u0027 \u0027There are more like me,\u0027 Cooper explained, \u0027but don\u0027t assume they\u0027re going to come back here. As far as they\u0027re concerned this is a dead place.\u0027 \u0027They might.\u0027 \u0027Yes, they might, but on balance they probably won\u0027t. As far as I was aware we were sent out on a reconnaissance mission and that was all. If the others made it back to the base and reported what they\u0027d found then...\u0027 \u0027Then what?\u0027 \u0027Then they\u0027ll know that there\u0027s no real reason for anyone to come back here, won\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027So what do you think they\u0027ll do?\u0027 Donna wondered. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter where they go, they\u0027re going to find the same thing.\u0027 Cooper shrugged his shoulders and continued eating. \u0027I really don\u0027t know. Like I said earlier, there were supposed to be other bases. I suppose they\u0027ll try and group together. But then again, maybe they\u0027ll just stay underground.\u0027 \u0027Christ, imagine spending the rest of your life in a bunker...\u0027 Phil Croft mumbled, finally making an effort and becoming part of the conversation. \u0027Better than not having the rest of your life,\u0027 Clare said quietly. \u0027You think so?\u0027 Cooper asked. \u0027You didn\u0027t see what it was like down there. Anyway, we don\u0027t know for sure if those are the only options. Whatever happened here might not have happened everywhere. I think it did, but it\u0027s always possible that there are some safe areas people could get to.\u0027 \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 said Croft. \u0027But do you see what I\u0027m saying?\u0027 Baxter continued, seizing on a lull in the conversation and picking up from where he\u0027d last spoken. \u0027You\u0027re talking about all these different scenarios but the bottom line is that something\u0027s inevitably going to change, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s damn unlikely that nothing\u0027s going to happen. The law of averages says that things will never stay the same.\u0027 \u0027What the bloody hell are you talking about?\u0027 Steve Richards sighed from his seat in the darkness. Baxter stared across the room in the general direction of the younger man. It was too dark for him to see exactly where he was sitting. \u0027Have you looked outside recently?\u0027 he asked, his voice suddenly cold and deadly serious. \u0027I try to avoid looking out of the window,\u0027 Richards smirked. \u0027Too fucking grim for my liking.\u0027 \u0027Do yourself a favour and go and take a look out front will you? There are bloody thousands of those things out there now and none of them are going anywhere. For whatever reason they\u0027re attracted to us and there are more and more of them arriving every hour.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s your point?\u0027 Richards asked. \u0027Seems to me there\u0027s going to come a time when the sheer volume of them outside is going to start causing us real problems.\u0027 \u0027Why? Do you think they\u0027ll get in?\u0027 wondered Heath, his voice low and nervous. \u0027They might,\u0027 Baxter replied, \u0027but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s very likely. I\u0027m thinking more about us trying to get out. We\u0027re going to have to leave here for supplies eventually, aren\u0027t we? There\u0027s only so much we can store here.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s got a point,\u0027 Donna agreed. \u0027The more I think about it, the better the argument is for packing up and getting out of here right now,\u0027 Baxter continued. \u0027There\u0027s also a lot to be said for sitting still and waiting,\u0027 Phil Croft added. \u0027But you are right, Jack, things are going to change no matter what we do. The bodies will change for a start.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re decomposing, aren\u0027t they? No matter how determined or persistent those bloody things are, there\u0027s going to come a time when they physically won\u0027t be able to do what they\u0027re doing any longer.\u0027 \u0027And how long\u0027s that going to be?\u0027 Donna pressed. \u0027How long do you think it will take them to rot completely?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Six months,\u0027 he suggested although he was far from certain. \u0027Six months!\u0027 Heath protested. Croft shrugged again. \u0027Could be. Might be longer. Might happen in half the time. There are a lot of unknown factors we\u0027re dealing with here.\u0027 \u0027Such as?\u0027 \u0027The disease for a start, we don\u0027t know what effect it might have on the speed of decomposition. And then there\u0027s the fact that they\u0027re above ground. I guess they\u0027d rot quicker if they were buried, but it might be that exposure to the elements and the physical effort of moving around wears the bodies down at a faster rate. I don\u0027t know for sure.\u0027 Donna suddenly stood up. The other survivors watched her. \u0027This is bloody brilliant,\u0027 she said with genuine excitement in her voice for the first time in weeks. \u0027Do you hear what you\u0027re saying?\u0027 She looked around at the blank faces staring back at her. \u0027Six months and we could be over the worst of this. Six bloody months and we might well be able to do whatever we damn well like again!\u0027 \u0027So we just need to find somewhere safe to hide out until then,\u0027 said Baxter. \u0027Stay here,\u0027 Heath immediately suggested. \u0027We can stay here until it\u0027s safe to move.\u0027 \u0027You haven\u0027t been listening, have you?\u0027 \u0027We need somewhere better than this, somewhere stronger and more isolated,\u0027 Donna announced. \u0027You need the base,\u0027 decided Cooper, his voice filled with resignation.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-31.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
