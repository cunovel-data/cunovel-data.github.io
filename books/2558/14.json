{"id":112086,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The atmosphere in the university accommodation block was by turn tense and expectant. Those survivors who had chosen to emerge from their rooms had gathered in the assembly hall where they sat in silence and waited pensively for something - anything - to happen. It was impossible for any of them to rest or sleep most of the time but tonight it was particularly difficult. Deep in the bowels of the building Sonya Farley was reaching the final stages of a long and painful labour. Her pain could be heard and felt in every corner of every otherwise silent room. The makeshift delivery room upstairs was brightly lit. Bright, that was, in comparison with the rest of the dark building. Several survivors had willingly given up torches and other lights to allow Phil Croft - the only person with any relevant medical experience - to deliver Sonya\u0027s baby. He was nervous and apprehensive. He hadn\u0027t done this for a while and this was only the third delivery that he\u0027d been actively involved in.\\n\\n Paulette, the large and remarkably bright and enthusiastic lady standing at his side, had been involved in three times as many. And more than half of those births had been her own children. Croft was pleased to have her around. Having been in Sonya\u0027s unenviable position on no less than five occasions, she was essential to the first time mother-to-be\u0027s wellbeing tonight. Although Croft knew all the technical terms and he could monitor and react to mother and baby\u0027s vital signs, Paulette was able to do something far more important. She could reassure her. She could talk to Sonya. She could tell her when to push and when to relax, when to breathe in and when to breathe out. She could understand, anticipate and explain the pain and tell her how well she was doing and how much more she had left to do. Croft admired her ability to somehow shut out her own personal fear and loss and ignore the devastation beyond the university walls to allow her to concentrate on the young girl lying in nervous agony on the sweat-soaked bed next to her. \u0027Come on, lover,\u0027 she said softly, gently stroking Sonya\u0027s forehead and at the same time gripping her hand tightly.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve not got long left to go now. We\u0027ll have this baby born within the hour.\u0027 Sonya\u0027s face screwed up in pain as another contraction peaked. Croft crouched at the end of the bed, feeling momentarily redundant and helpless and wishing that he could have used some of the monitoring equipment and painrelieving drugs sitting silent and useless in the nearby hospital. He administered what medicines he could, but they had little effect. Sonya was fully dilated. He could see the first whisps of greasy dark hair on the top of the baby\u0027s head. \u0027Nearly there,\u0027 he said quietly. Sonya relaxed momentarily as the pain faded away. Apart from the expected agony and emotion of childbirth she felt surprisingly calm.\\n\\n This was just how the midwife had said it would be during the pre-natal classes she\u0027d attended. Even though it hurt more than any pain she\u0027d ever felt before, it somehow felt good. It was positive pain, and she knew it was right. Nothing in what remained of her life made sense anymore except this. Her husband was gone. Her friends and family were dead. She had lost her home and possessions and she had nothing left except the precious little person inside her who was about to be born. And it felt so right. For the first time since the nightmare had begun something was happening as it was supposed to. Another sharp contraction. They were becoming unbearable. Sonya screamed out in agony and squeezed Paulette\u0027s hand so tightly that the other woman winced in pain. \u0027Come on,\u0027 she soothed, crouching lower so that her face was close to Sonya\u0027s. \u0027Baby\u0027s ready to come now.\u0027\\n\\n Fifty-five minutes later and the moment had arrived. Sonya\u0027s incredible pain again built to an almost unbearable crescendo before being dramatically relieved as her baby was delivered in a sudden release of pressure and a rush of activity and emotion. Croft guided the child safely down onto the bed between its mother\u0027s ankles and gently wiped blood and other bodily fluids from its face. He clamped and cut the cord and then quickly whisked the baby away to the makeshift crib they\u0027d prepared. His face was a picture of intense concentration as he checked the baby\u0027s vital signs and waited anxiously for it to respond. The silence was deafening. \u0027You did it, lover,\u0027 whispered Paulette, kissing the top of Sonya\u0027s sweatsoaked head. Sonya watched with unexpected nervousness as Croft worked on her child. When she\u0027d first fallen pregnant she remembered her mother telling her that this was the worst part - the wait for the baby to realise it had been born and to start to breathe and react for itself. She\u0027d tried to prepare herself but it was impossible. Every long second of silence felt like hours. Then it happened. A sudden, shrill and piercing cry of surprise and realisation from the child in the crib. Croft glanced across at Sonya and smiled. \u0027Perfect little baby girl,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Well done.\u0027 For a few blissful moments nothing else mattered. With huge, saucer eyes filled with tears of joy and relief, Sonya watched as the doctor wrapped her little baby in a soft blanket and carried her across the room. Ignoring the pain and discomfort she felt, she sat up and took the little bundle from him. Shutting out the rest of the world, she stared down into a beautiful, wrinkled, blotchy blue-pink face. She stroked the baby\u0027s cheek with a single gentle finger and revelled in the warmth, movement and noise that the little girl had innocently brought to her otherwise lifeless world. \u0027What are you going to call her?\u0027 asked Paulette, peering over the mother\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 Sonya replied quietly. \u0027We had a few ideas for names but we hadn\u0027t settled on anything for definite.\u0027 \u0027Take your time and get it right. I always said it was easier to give them a name once you knew what they looked like. Until then you...\u0027\\n\\n Paulette suddenly stopped talking. The baby had stopped crying. The room was quiet. The three adults in the room exchanged nervous glances. Both women looked to Croft for an explanation. When he remained silent Sonya looked down and gave her little girl\u0027s hand a gentle squeeze. Nothing. And then the baby opened its mouth wide and let out a sudden, rasping cry. The cry turned into a helpless splutter. Then another cough. Then another and another until the high-pitched coughing had become a constant scream of innocent, helpless agony. Sonya held her daughter close to her breast, desperate to help but knowing that there was nothing she could do. Croft tried to help and take the baby from her but she wouldn\u0027t let go. They knew what was happening. The deadly contagion still hung heavy in the air. Just minutes after being born the baby was dead. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-14.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
