{"id":112121,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"Exhausted and almost asleep, Michael was slumped forward against the steering wheel of the motorhome. A sudden noise made him jolt upright in his seat, instantly awake. \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 he cursed as the police van thundered past and tore into the field packed with bodies. \u0027Where the fucking hell did that come from?\u0027 Emma ran to his side and watched with surprise and disbelief as the van ripped a bloody path through the mass of wandering corpses.\n Before she could speak the prison truck appeared. \u0027Follow them,\u0027 she gasped, her mouth dry with sudden shock and nerves. With his heart pounding and his hands shaking Michael started the engine and attempted to move the motorhome forwards.\n All around them bodies were reacting with ominous strength and fury to the sudden melee. Some staggered after the van and the truck, others turned and lurched quickly towards the lumbering bulk of the motorhome.\n The police van skidded to a halt about a hundred meters ahead, the once white (but now muddy brown and blood-soaked) truck a few meters further on. They watched as a man hung out of the side of the truck and began to gesture furiously to the people in the van. He was waving back in the direction of the incline that they had just powered over. Seconds later the reversing lights on the back of the van were suddenly illuminated and the vehicle sped back towards the motorhome, its engine whining and its wheels churning mud, gore and rotting flesh up into the cold morning air. The driver slammed on the brakes when the two vehicles were parallel. There was a gap of less than a metre between them. He wound down his window and shouted over to Emma. \u0027Any room inside?\u0027 Cooper yelled. Still stunned, Emma could only nod her head in reply. \u0027How many of you are in there?\u0027 \u0027Just two of us,\u0027 she stammered. \u0027We think there\u0027s a base here...\u0027 \u0027One of our trucks has gone down in the forest,\u0027 the soldier shouted back.\n \u0027I need to go back for them. Can you have my passengers?\u0027 Emma didn\u0027t know how to respond. Could these people be trusted? Instantly sensing her obvious unease Michael leant across and took over the conversation. Whether they could trust them or not, it didn\u0027t matter. These people were survivors. It had to be worth taking a chance. \u0027There\u0027s a side door,\u0027 he shouted. \u0027Get them out of the back of the van and I\u0027ll open up.\u0027 Without waiting for the other man to respond Michael left his seat and ran down the inside of the motorhome to the door. He threw it open and immediately began kicking, pushing and hitting out of the way the countless sickly cadavers that reached out for him. A meter and a half away the back of the van flew open and four survivors jumped down into the field, slipping and sliding in the muddy confusion.\n Michael reached out and grabbed hold of Donna, hauling her quickly to safety. Between them they dragged the other three inside before slamming the door shut. Jack Baxter pulled the van door closed before climbing back into the front and sitting down next to Cooper. He glanced over his shoulder and checked that the others were safe. \u0027They\u0027re in,\u0027 he gasped, panting heavily with effort. \u0027Let\u0027s move.\u0027 Donna and the other three survivors from the city collapsed into the back of the motorhome as the police van pulled away outside. Bodies all around the long vehicle smashed their decaying fists against the thin metal walls, fighting to get at the people inside. \u0027There\u0027s a base or something round here,\u0027 Emma mumbled, her composure slowly beginning to return. \u0027We were trying to get in.\u0027 Donna nodded. \u0027Cooper came from here,\u0027 she said, nodding in the direction of van that was moving back towards the ridge. \u0027He\u0027s going to get us inside.\u0027 \u0027How many of you are there?\u0027 Michael asked as he sat back down in the driver\u0027s seat.\n \u0027About thirty,\u0027 she replied, following him. Thirty people, Michael thought. The hopelessness that had weighed him down for almost a month suddenly began to lift. Ignorant to the hundreds of diseased cadavers still fighting to get at them, he allowed himself the faintest smile of satisfaction. Cooper was struggling. The already rough ground had been churned up by the numerous military vehicles that had driven to and from the base recently. The constantly swarming bodies made it virtually impossible for him to keep the van moving in a straight line along the uneven track and the tired engine struggled to climb back up towards the ridge. They stopped moving. The van\u0027s wheels span furiously, sending more and more mud flying into the air but failing to grip the ground. The soldier took his foot off the pedals and let the heavy vehicle roll a short distance back down the hill.\n \u0027We\u0027re never going to get back up there,\u0027 Baxter said. \u0027We\u0027ll go round,\u0027 Cooper replied, glancing from left to right and trying to work out which side of the hill to attack. He chose to go right and powered forward again. The ground was more level and, to his relief, he was finally able to build up a little speed. He pushed harder and harder, knocking more and more rag-doll bodies flying, until his velocity was such that he could risk attempting the climb again. Baxter held onto the sides of his seat as Cooper swerved back round to the left and forced the van through the remains of the crowd and up over the top of the ridge.\n The effort of the screaming engine was suddenly reduced as they reached the crest and began to travel along the flat again. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Baxter said as they approached the prison truck lying stranded on its side.\n \u0027What a damn mess.\u0027 Cooper stopped the van a short distance back and surveyed the scene. The number of bodies nearby meant that they couldn\u0027t risk getting out and attempting a rescue on foot. Although the majority of them remained in the field near the entrance to the base, many more had obviously been congregating nearby. The front of the truck was surrounded by a dense throng of some thirty lurching, grabbing cadavers. \u0027How the hell are we going to do this?\u0027 Baxter asked. Cooper didn\u0027t bother to answer. Instead he drove forward again, turned the van round in a tight arc and began to reverse towards the truck\u0027s upturned cab. Distracted by the noise of the approaching vehicle, the bodies turned and began to move towards them. \u0027Open the doors,\u0027 he yelled as he leant out of the window to his side and steered the van back. Baxter quickly scrambled out of his seat and crawled to the far end of the van. He threw the doors open and then jumped back as the van smashed into the cab of the truck.\n A random body, trapped by broken legs pinned between the two vehicles, thrashed its arms furiously. Before Baxter could react Cooper was with him. The soldier punched the corpse in the face repeatedly until it dropped down and lay still. The cab of the truck was sideways on, leaving the survivors just enough clearance to be able to clamber up and over its battered bulk. \u0027We\u0027ll get them out from the back and bring them over the top,\u0027 Cooper explained, wiping his bloodied hands on the back of his trousers. \u0027We\u0027ll get Paul and Phil out first.\u0027 Carefully choosing his spot for fear of causing further injury to the two men, Cooper lifted a single heavy boot and kicked the centre of the cracked windscreen. Already weakened, the window gave way after just a few blows. Baxter leant forward and looked down at Paul Castle\u0027s bloody body.\n \u0027Poor sod,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027he\u0027s gone.\u0027 Cooper nodded as he worked to unfasten Croft\u0027s seatbelt. Once freed, the unconscious bulk of the doctor dropped into his arms. He pulled the injured medic free from the wreckage and laid him down carefully. Baxter frowned and tried to ignore the bodies battering on the sides of the van. The bloody irony of it, he thought. The only survivor who had the medical knowledge to make good injuries like these was the one who lay there wounded. \u0027Get ready to help them in,\u0027 Cooper said as he climbed out of the van. He hauled himself up onto the upward facing driver\u0027s door and ran the length of the side of the truck. There was a door halfway between the front and back. He yanked at the handle but it wouldn\u0027t move. He could hear the people trapped inside thumping on the wall, trying desperately to get out.\n \u0027Get me the keys,\u0027 he yelled back to Baxter who was watching helplessly. The older man did as he was instructed, reaching in through what was left of the shattered windscreen and twisting his arm around the steering column until his outstretched fingers made contact with the keys. From his awkward angle he tried to tease the keys free and succeeded, only for them to drop to the ground and land in the puddle of coagulating blood around Paul Castle\u0027s icywhite face. With equal amounts of revulsion, nausea and sadness he closed his eyes and leant down and grabbed at the keys, wiping them clean on his jacket as he lifted them up. \u0027Here,\u0027 he shouted, throwing them up onto the side of the truck.\n Cooper picked them up and immediately dropped to his knees by the door. There were many keys on the bunch and it took several attempts before he found the right one. Eventually the lock clicked, the door opened outwards and the arms, head and body of the first bruised and bloodied survivor quickly emerged. \u0027Get ready Jack,\u0027 the soldier yelled, \u0027they\u0027re on their way to you.\u0027 He leant down and began to help a middle-aged woman out of the truck. Helped by more survivors pushing her out from inside, she was soon free. \u0027Get yourself down into the van,\u0027 Cooper said gently as he reached down for the next person. \u0027Jack\u0027s waiting there for you.\u0027 On her hands and knees, the woman shuffled towards the front of the truck. As she moved she looked down at the increasing crowds of bodies gathering on either side. Sensing her unease, Baxter coaxed her forward. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said, \u0027nearly there.\u0027 Back on top of the vehicle Cooper had pulled two children and another woman free.\n He peered back inside and counted another seven people still waiting. He could also see a corpse. He didn\u0027t recognise the man who lay face down on the ground, crushed by the others in the sudden impact and crash. Baxter climbed out onto the truck to help the children down. As he guided more survivors into the van, Cooper screamed more instructions to him. \u0027Get behind the wheel.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 Baxter replied frantically. \u0027I can\u0027t drive.\u0027 \u0027Then find someone who can,\u0027 the soldier frantically barked. \u0027Do it now, for fucking hell\u0027s sake!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 the first woman to have been rescued mumbled. \u0027You\u0027ll have to tell me where to...\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 \u0027Jean,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I don\u0027t know if...\u0027 Baxter wasn\u0027t listening. \u0027I\u0027ll give you a shout when we\u0027re ready to move,\u0027 he said, pushing her forward. She clambered into the driver\u0027s seat and froze as she looked up and around. A dense crowd of grotesque faces stared back at her, their clouded eyes filled with pain and a savage intent bordering on hate. She looked down at the ground and tried to keep control of her fragile emotions. The bloody things were banging on the glass around her now. She held her head in her hands and prayed that they would soon be able to move. \u0027Last one,\u0027 Cooper yelled from on top of the truck. Moments later the final survivor appeared and climbed down into the van. Cooper was close behind. \u0027Pull forward and close the doors,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027Pull forward,\u0027 Baxter repeated.\n The woman in the front of the van pushed down on the accelerator and eased the van slowly forward, pushing steadily into the rotting crowd which surrounded them. As soon as they were far enough from the remains of the truck to be able to close the doors, Baxter looked up at Cooper. \u0027Close the fucking doors,\u0027 the soldier said again. Helped by another survivor Baxter pulled the doors shut. The van rocked momentarily as the soldier jumped onto the roof from the cab of the truck. Losing his footing, Cooper threw himself flat and edged towards the front of the vehicle. He smashed his fist onto the windscreen and gestured forward. \u0027Move!\u0027 he ordered. \u0027Just fucking move!\u0027 The van lurched forward again.\n Cooper pressed his face down against the cold metal and held on for all he was worth. Back in the middle of the field Michael sat nervously behind the wheel of the motorhome waiting for the van to reappear. \u0027This isn\u0027t good,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027I think we should go and...\u0027 He stopped talking when the van powered over the ridge and began a fast and uncoordinated descent back into the field, obliterating countless bedraggled bodies. Cooper clung onto the top of the van, his feet and one hand wrapped around the roof bars. With his one free hand he gestured towards Michael for him to drive around a small mound in the centre of the field.\n Michael immediately did as instructed, as did Steve Armitage following close behind. The remaining prison truck belched clouds of noxious exhaust fumes into the morning air already polluted by the rancid stench of death and decay. Around the back of the mound, completely hidden from view from all other approaches, was a huge grey door, partially sunken into the ground. Bodies swarmed around the three vehicles with frantic energy and bile. \u0027Hit the horn!\u0027 Donna screamed as soon as she saw the door. \u0027Let them know we\u0027re here.\u0027 Michael slammed his fist down on the horn. Seconds later Armitage did the same. The woman driving the van did the same as it trundled round the corner. The air was filled with noise, and the noise drove what remained of the massive crowd wild. The motorhome stopped just meters away from the huge concealed entrance. \u0027What now?\u0027 Michael demanded. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, what are we supposed to do now?\u0027 \u0027Just keep sounding the horn,\u0027 Donna sighed.\n \u0027They\u0027ll hear us eventually.\u0027 \u0027And so will every corpse in the fucking country,\u0027 he hissed under his breath. Without warning the doors began to slide open. Painfully slowly, the heavy barriers began to part. As soon as a wide enough gap had appeared a stream of soldiers in protective clothing emerged, every inch of their bodies hidden. They aimed their weapons into the crowds and began to fire indiscriminately. Bodies began falling to the ground. The space left by each fallen corpse was immediately filled by several more. Without waiting for instruction, as soon as the gap in the doors was wide enough Michael accelerated and drove into the base. It was immense. He had never seen anything like it.\n The prison truck forced its way inside, followed close behind by the police van. Cooper climbed down from the roof and looked around. His exhaustion, nerves and fear were immediately replaced by a claustrophobic and cold familiarity. The sound of gunshots continued to fill the air as the soldiers closed the doors and picked off the last few bodies, throwing their remains back out into the open before the doors slammed shut. Michael, Emma, Donna, Baxter, Cooper, Heath and the rest of the survivors gathered in the centre of a cavernous and well-lit hanger packed with a vast array of military hardware. The soldiers surrounded the exhausted group. The guns that had moments earlier been pointed at the bodies outside were now pointed at them. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-50.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
