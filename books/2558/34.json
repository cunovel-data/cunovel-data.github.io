{"id":112105,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"The long day dragged unbearably. After many hours of arguments, counter-arguments and frustration, the atmosphere in the assembly hall was deteriorating rapidly. By early evening tempers were wearing dangerously thin. \u0027Have you looked out of the bloody window recently?\u0027 Baxter spat angrily. \u0027Do you know what\u0027s out there?\u0027 \u0027More to the point,\u0027 Donna interrupted angrily, \u0027have you seen what\u0027s still in here? Have you seen the level of our supplies? I tell you, we won\u0027t last long if we don\u0027t do something soon...\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s right,\u0027 Cooper added from across the room. \u0027Staying here isn\u0027t going to be an option for much longer.\u0027 \u0027And what the fuck do you know?\u0027 Nathan Holmes yelled, his voice hoarse and strained with emotion. This argument had been raging for the best part of an hour with, it seemed, much of the venom directed towards him personally. \u0027I\u0027m sure you know a hell of a lot more than you\u0027re letting on,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027I bet you know exactly what caused all of this fucking mess to happen.\u0027 \u0027I wish I did,\u0027 the soldier sighed. \u0027Then at least I might know what to do.\u0027 Frightened faces peered out from every corner of the hall, illuminated by numerous candles, torches and lamps. The light in the room was dull and uneven leaving even more people hidden in darkness. For once almost all the survivors sheltering in the building were gathered together - even the most reclusive of them having been drawn out of hiding by the events surrounding the soldier\u0027s recent arrival. For many others the hall had become the only room they used. Being alone in the individual rooms they had previously occupied had become too unsettling for most. Better to snatch a few moments of sleep in the company of others than to spend endless hours alone, wide awake and on edge. \u0027Look,\u0027 Donna continued, \u0027Phil reckons that in six months time the bodies will have rotted away to just about nothing. Isn\u0027t that right, Phil?\u0027 She peered round in the darkness, trying to find the doctor. He was sitting on the floor just a few meters from where she was standing. He\u0027d been trying to avoid getting dragged into the conversation. Instead he\u0027d been busying himself by trying to keep a seven year old boy interested in a jigsaw puzzle and hoping that he\u0027d be able to stop him crying. \u0027Something like that,\u0027 he grunted, \u0027give or take a few weeks either way.\u0027 \u0027So we\u0027ll wait here for six months,\u0027 Holmes announced. Donna shook her head. Once full of macho pretense, the odious man was now letting his true colours show. His plans to get out of the building and take what he wanted from the dead city had been forgotten. He was as scared as the rest of the survivors, but he didn\u0027t have the intelligence to deal with his feelings. His fear displayed itself as antagonism and anger. \u0027Which part of this don\u0027t you understand, Nathan,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027We haven\u0027t got enough supplies here to last for six more days, never mind six months. We\u0027ve got to go out into the city now, whether you like it or not.\u0027 Holmes didn\u0027t respond. He\u0027d never admit as much, but he was intimidated by Donna. He didn\u0027t have the ability to able to reply to her words with anything that resembled a sensible and coherent argument as to why they should lock themselves down and stay put until the countless bodies outside had finally fallen again. \u0027She\u0027s right,\u0027 Baxter said, stepping forward out of the shadows into which he\u0027d subconsciously retreated as the argument had become more heated. \u0027We don\u0027t have an option really. If you stop and...\u0027 \u0027What the fuck do you know?\u0027 Holmes spat, suddenly feeling more confident. He knew that he could handle Jack Baxter. Refusing to rise to the other man\u0027s anger, Jack ran his fingers through his hair and stared at him through the darkness. \u0027I know as much as you do, Nathan,\u0027 he said, pointing his finger accusingly and shaking his head. \u0027But if you forget about how you\u0027re feeling and take a look at the whole picture, it seems we don\u0027t have any choice.\u0027 Several hours later and the anger and raised voices that had filled the hall had been long forgotten by many of the survivors. Nathan Holmes had disappeared into the depths of the building and with him much of the conflict and hostility seemed to have gone too. Apart from a few mumbled conversations and the low and dull but ever-present noise of the bodies outside the assembly room was largely silent. Jack Baxter sat with his back against the wall doing his best to fade into the already drab and inconspicuous background. The benefit of darkness, he thought to himself, was that he could hide without having to move. He could observe things happening nearby whilst still managing to feel like he was a safe distance away. Baxter was sitting in a corner of the room near to Cooper, Croft and Donna. Clare lay next to him on a makeshift bed made from folded blankets. She was sleeping relatively soundly. He frequently watched her when she was asleep, feeling as if he had a responsibility to protect her because he was the one who had been with her the longest. She was a pretty girl with soft, delicate features which, for once, looked untroubled and relaxed. It wasn\u0027t often that... \u0027What do you think, Jack?\u0027 he heard Phil Croft ask. At the mention of his name he looked up. \u0027What?\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027You\u0027re not with us, are you?\u0027 smiled Donna. \u0027Nothing against any of you,\u0027 he smiled, looking deeper into the darkness and trying to focus on the others, \u0027but I wish I was anywhere but here.\u0027 Cooper kept the conversation on track. \u0027We were talking about getting out of here,\u0027 he began. \u0027What, still?\u0027 he moaned. \u0027Christ, haven\u0027t you got anything better to talk about?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Donna replied abruptly. \u0027Bloody hell, what else is there to talk about?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Decided where we\u0027re going yet then?\u0027 Silence. It was one thing talking about what they should do, but when it came to actually making decisions it was difficult to get any of the survivors to speak out with any conviction. \u0027We\u0027re not completely sure whether...\u0027 muttered Croft before Cooper interrupted. \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious?\u0027 he sighed. \u0027There\u0027s only one place we can go, isn\u0027t there?\u0027 Donna added. \u0027Your base?\u0027 ventured Baxter. \u0027Much as I don\u0027t like the thought of going back there, we don\u0027t seem to have much choice at the moment.\u0027 \u0027So will your people let us inside?\u0027 he asked. \u0027They might. I don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think they will.\u0027 Everyone looked at Jack. \u0027Why not?\u0027 Donna asked. \u0027I know we seem to be immune to whatever\u0027s done all this,\u0027 he explained, his voice tired and low, \u0027but I bet we\u0027re still carrying it. If it\u0027s a disease then we\u0027re going to be full of it, aren\u0027t we? It\u0027ll be in our lungs and in our blood. There\u0027s no way they\u0027re going to let us inside if we\u0027re going to bring it in with us.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve just got to hope the decontamination process is good enough to clean us up properly then, haven\u0027t we?\u0027 Cooper said. \u0027Do you think it will be?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 he admitted after a moment of careful consideration. \u0027There\u0027s another problem of course,\u0027 yawned Croft. The doctor was incredibly tired but he knew it wasn\u0027t worth trying to sleep. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Cooper asked. \u0027How the hell are we going to get there?\u0027 \u0027How many people are here?\u0027 \u0027Between forty and fifty,\u0027 he replied. \u0027And how many will leave with us?\u0027 \u0027No idea. Probably not that many. Say half.\u0027 \u0027Theoretically we can take our pick of just about anything we can find in the city,\u0027 said Donna. \u0027If we can get to it,\u0027 interrupted Baxter. \u0027So what do you suggest?\u0027 Cooper asked. \u0027We need to be sensible about this. We\u0027re not going to be able to just drive out of here in a convoy of cars, are we?\u0027 \u0027What did you arrive in? We heard it but we didn\u0027t see it.\u0027 \u0027Armoured patrol carrier. I could probably drive one of those if we had one, but I don\u0027t expect we\u0027ll find anything like that round here...\u0027 Baxter managed half a smile. \u0027You might be surprised,\u0027 Donna said quietly. The other faces turned to look at her. \u0027What have you got in mind?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a courthouse near here,\u0027 she replied. \u0027And?\u0027 \u0027And round the back there\u0027s a loading bay.\u0027 \u0027A loading bay?\u0027 Croft mumbled. He wasn\u0027t at all sure where her logic was leading. \u0027We could see it from the office where I worked. We used to watch them unloading when there was a big trial on,\u0027 she explained. \u0027The prison vans used to pull up around the back and reverse inside to deliver and collect the prisoners.\u0027 \u0027So?\u0027 \u0027Think about it. Prison vans are designed to carry people. More than that, they\u0027re strong and they\u0027re safe. They\u0027re as close to a bloody armoured patrol carrier as we\u0027re going to get.\u0027 \u0027Are there any vans there now?\u0027 \u0027How am I supposed to know? There\u0027s a good chance there will be though. Just about every morning you\u0027d see at least one of them pulling up. Logic says that if the courts were going to be in session when all of this started, there would have been prisoners there.\u0027 \u0027I know the court,\u0027 Baxter whispered secretively. \u0027But how are we supposed to get there? It\u0027s halfway across town.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 Donna admitted. \u0027I can\u0027t see how we\u0027re going to get past the crowds out there. And even if we do manage to get through, how are we supposed to get back here again? Christ, imagine what the noise of a load of prison vans will do to them?\u0027 Cooper took a swig from a cup of cold black coffee that he\u0027d made almost an hour earlier. He winced at its bitter aftertaste. \u0027Seems to me that whatever we do is going to drive them crazy,\u0027 he said, \u0027but there isn\u0027t any alternative. We\u0027ve already decided that we\u0027re going to have to go out at some point.\u0027 \u0027Any suggestions?\u0027 asked Donna expectantly. \u0027I came up through a subway.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s going to help us get out there,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Getting back without them seeing or hearing us is going to be impossible if we manage to get our hands on some kind of transport.\u0027 \u0027We could go out at night,\u0027 Croft offered. \u0027Not a good idea,\u0027 Cooper responded. \u0027I know what you\u0027re saying, but you\u0027ve got to add up the risks and balance them all out, haven\u0027t you? Whatever we do we\u0027re bound to attract attention to ourselves because of the noise we make if nothing else. If we go out in the dark then we\u0027re just going to make it harder for ourselves. They\u0027ll still react to us so we might as well go out in the daylight and give ourselves the best possible chance.\u0027 \u0027If we\u0027re really going to do this,\u0027 Donna continued, \u0027then we need to think very carefully before we put a single foot outside. From what I\u0027ve seen of those things out there they seem to be getting more and more aggressive each day. We have to get everything we need in one trip.\u0027 \u0027We can do it,\u0027 Cooper insisted. \u0027A few of us need to get out there, get what we need and get back. Once the excitement\u0027s died down again we can get everyone who wants to leave together and we can move.\u0027 Jack Baxter lay down on the cold, hard floor next to Clare and listened as the conversation continued. He agreed with everything that was being suggested, but the fact that it was right didn\u0027t make it any easier to deal with. Within the walls of the university it had to an extent become possible to isolate themselves from events outside. The sudden realisation that they were about to leave the safety of the building and head back out into the unknown was terrifying. Unavoidable, necessary and terrifying.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-34.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
