She was tired. It felt like they\u0027d been talking about this for hours. \u0027Find them,\u0027 he said simply. \u0027But is that wise?\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027If this really is the army or airforce or whatever, do we really want to get involved with them?\u0027 \u0027Do we have a choice? Whoever they are, they\u0027re obviously well organised. You never know, they might have an antidote or something. There could be bloody hundreds of them holded-up somewhere.\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t need an antidote.\u0027 \u0027I know that,\u0027 he snapped.\\n\\n \u0027All I\u0027m trying to say is that this whole thing might not be as hopeless as we\u0027ve been thinking...\u0027 \u0027And anyway,\u0027 she continued unabated, ignoring everything he\u0027d said, \u0027everybody\u0027s already dead. It\u0027d need to be a bloody good antidote to help those poor bastards out there.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 Michael sighed, annoyed by her flippancy and her reluctance to try and find some good in the day\u0027s events, \u0027you\u0027ve made your point.\u0027 A brief moment of silence followed. Emma looked around the cramped motorhome where she\u0027d spent virtually every minute of the last few days. She hoped with all her heart that Michael\u0027s optimism was justified. After the relentless grief, despair and fear which had burdened them both constantly since the nightmare had begun, the possibility that some semblance of normality might somehow be about to return to their lives was welcome and unexpected. But it was so unexpected that she wouldn\u0027t allow herself to believe it was true until the fragments of possibility and hope had been evidenced and cemented into reality.\\n\\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 Michael asked, concerned by how quiet and reflective she had suddenly become. \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 she answered sadly. \u0027Sure?\u0027 She shook her head and looked down at the table. \u0027No,\u0027 she mumbled. Suddenly uneasy and self-conscious, Michael shuffled awkwardly in his seat. He\u0027d spent weeks with Emma now but there was still an occasional distance between them. He grew more and more relaxed and assured in her company each day, but moments like this felt uncomfortable. Truth was he didn\u0027t know what to say to her. He didn\u0027t know how to make her pain go away. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 She wiped her eyes and looked up at him. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she sobbed, \u0027I can\u0027t help it. Most of the time I\u0027m okay, but then sometimes I...\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 Emma looked around the caravan, searching for the words to express how she felt. \u0027I just want this to stop,\u0027 she explained. \u0027I want to go to sleep tonight and wake up in the morning and find everything back as it used to be. And if that\u0027s not going to happen, I want to wake up and find the bodies gone and the uncertainty gone and the fear gone and...\u0027 \u0027Shh...\u0027 he whispered, worried that her voice was becoming loud enough to be heard from outside. \u0027Listen, you know as well as I do that the only certainty round here is that things are never going to get back to normal, don\u0027t you?\u0027 She nodded. \u0027Yes, but...\u0027 \u0027If this is all we\u0027ve got left then we\u0027ve got to make the most of it. We\u0027ll get used to living like this and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But this isn\u0027t living,\u0027 she protested tearfully. \u0027How can you call this living? This is barely existing for Christ\u0027s sake. Look at us, Mike. Look at what\u0027s happening to us. We smell. We\u0027re dirty. We haven\u0027t washed properly for weeks.\\n\\n Our clothes are filthy. We both need to cut our hair and you need to shave. We\u0027re not eating properly or exercising or...\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re making do,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027And when we can we\u0027ll find somewhere to live where we can wash and relax and grow our own food. We\u0027ll get new clothes and we\u0027ll build ourselves a bloody palace somewhere, okay?\u0027 She sniffed back more tears. \u0027Okay,\u0027 she replied. Michael stared into her tear-streaked face.\\n\\n She was right, but what could they do? As far as he could see there was no immediate way out of the situation they found themselves in. They had to remain mobile and go without some base necessities in order to survive. He truly believed that things would change eventually, they had to. The bodies would decay away to nothing in time. \u0027Hungry?\u0027 he asked, looking for a way to distract Emma from her dark and difficult thoughts. She nodded and sank back into her seat.\\n\\n \u0027A little.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll get you something.\u0027 She watched him as he stood up and walked the short length of the motorhome to the cramped kitchen area. Their vehicle shelter was safe but stifling. She might have been able to cope with the confined space had she been able to venture outside occasionally. As it was she was trapped, and she was finding the motorhome increasingly claustrophobic. Even though they had intentionally driven out into the middle of nowhere, for safety\u0027s sake they had draped thick blankets over every window and door to prevent any light from seeping out into the darkness and giving away their presence.\\n\\n Almost three weeks had passed since the day the disease had struck but Emma still couldn\u0027t adjust to the way she was having to live. She\u0027d known from the start that she\u0027d probably never fully come to terms with the devastation and loss she\u0027d experienced, but there were other much more subtle ways in which she was struggling. Having to remain deathly silent was harder than she would ever have imagined.\\n\\n She was growing tired of having to think about everything in terms of how much noise she was going to make. Michael came back to the table and sat down. He carried with him more coffee and two pots of dehydrated snack food. Steam snaked up into the air from the top of each pot. \u0027Beef and tomato or sweet and sour?\u0027 he asked. They had found a job-lot of these snacks in the storeroom of a small corner shop they\u0027d looted earlier in the week. The food tasted awful but it was hot, easy to prepare and relatively nutritious. \u0027Can\u0027t stand sweet and sour,\u0027 she answered, \u0027but I prefer it to beef and tomato.\u0027 He passed her the sweet and sour flavoured food and a fork.\\n\\n Still sniffing back tears she began to eat hungrily and without further complaint. \u0027I think they\u0027ll be back,\u0027 Michael said between mouthfuls of tasteless food. \u0027Who will?\u0027 asked Emma. He looked at her in disbelief. How could she have forgotten already? \u0027Whoever it was I saw today,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Remember? Bloody hell, Emma, anyone would think you didn\u0027t mind living in a shit-hole like this eating plastic food out of a plastic pot!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027I\u0027m tired. Look, I know how important this is to you...\u0027 \u0027Do you?\u0027 Michael snapped. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she insisted, \u0027of course I do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you stopped to think where these people might be from? This might not be as widespread as we\u0027d thought. Maybe it\u0027s only this country that\u0027s been affected...\u0027 He stopped talking, aware that Emma had put down her fork and that she was staring at him. \u0027Don\u0027t do this,\u0027 she said softly, reaching her hand out across the table and gently squeezing his. \u0027Please don\u0027t let your imagination run away with you. Until we know more let\u0027s just keep our feet on the ground and take every day as it comes. I don\u0027t want to start thinking things are going to change only to find that we\u0027re back in the same damn mess again and nothing\u0027s happened. Do you know what I\u0027m trying to say?\u0027 \u0027No, not really.\u0027\\n\\n She sighed and squeezed his hand again. \u0027As far as I\u0027m concerned you\u0027re all I\u0027ve got left. You\u0027re the only thing left that I can count on. My family and friends are gone. I don\u0027t have a home any longer and I don\u0027t own anything other than what\u0027s in this van. The only thing I seem to be able to hold onto is you, and I\u0027m not about to let you go.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t have to. I\u0027m not going anywhere. I\u0027m not suggesting that we do anything that\u0027s going to...\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want to take any chances, Mike. You know how much I hate all of this, but if this is as good as it\u0027s going to get then it\u0027s going to have to do. Let\u0027s just keep our heads, take our time and not take any chances, okay?\u0027\\n\\n He looked across the table and into her eyes and nodded. Much as he wanted to follow the track and try and find the other survivors he knew that she was right. He felt strangely guilty for a moment. Did he give their relationship and need for each other the same importance that Emma appeared to? For a split second he tried to imagine being without her. He couldn\u0027t. She was all he had too. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-25.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
