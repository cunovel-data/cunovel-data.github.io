{"id":112112,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\u0027They\u0027re coming!\u0027 shouted one of the survivors from a lookout position on the third floor of the university accommodation block. The building was otherwise quiet and the disembodied voice of the lookout quickly travelled down empty corridors and into the various room where the rest of the survivors sat and waited. Donna and Keith Peterson were the first to react. They jumped up from where they had been waiting anxiously in the assembly hall and sprinted quickly through the complex.\\n\\n They headed over to a balcony on the side of the building which overlooked the enclosed football pitch that they had earlier agreed to use as a temporary lock-up for their vehicles until they were ready to leave the city. Donna pushed her way out through double-fronted glass doors and leant precariously over the edge of the balcony, craning her neck to try and catch sight of the returning survivors while, at the same time, doing her best to ignore the nauseous vertigo and fear she felt hanging a hundred feet above the crowds of corpses. She could hear some kind of transport approaching but the disorientating silence of the world made it impossible for her to be able to tell how far away they were and in which direction they were travelling. There were relatively few bodies on the ground below the balcony - perhaps only a hundred or so - and Donna also thought that their numbers appeared to have reduced somewhat around the part of the front of the building that she could see.\\n\\n The noise and distractions caused by the survivors being in another part of the city had temporarily tempted a large proportion of the immense crowd of figures away from the university. It was obvious, however, that the return of the six men would inevitably also result in the return of massive swarms of the decaying corpses. \u0027I can see them,\u0027 Keith Peterson said. He had climbed up onto the metal safety barrier surrounding the balcony and was holding onto the door they had just come through for support. \u0027Are they all there?\u0027 Donna asked anxiously. \u0027Can\u0027t tell,\u0027 Peterson replied. \u0027There are at least three of them. I can see a van and two trucks.\u0027 The blood-splattered convoy slowly pulled into view, the white fronts of the van and the trucks having been soaked with the gore and dripping remains of a thousand collisions with a thousand rotting bodies.\\n\\n Inside the lead van Phil Croft steered towards the welcome sight of the university buildings with Cooper at his side still trying to peer through the mayhem of countless random figures, trying to locate the track which would take them off the main road and deeper into the centre of the complex. Ignorant to the danger of the huge and powerful machines, the pathetic corpses continued relentlessly to gravitate around the vehicles. Croft took a sudden sharp left. He recognised the narrow road. He knew that it would take them all the way around the back of the building and allow them full access to the rest of the site.\\n\\n He glanced up into the rear view mirror and, amongst the confusion, watched as first one and then both trucks turned and followed him away from the main road. \u0027Not far now,\u0027 he said quietly. Cooper didn\u0027t respond. Instead he turned around on his seat and stared up at the accommodation block which they were slowly passing. He was looking for the other survivors, wanting to be sure that they knew they had returned. He saw Donna and Peterson first, and then noticed other faces peering out from different windows on different levels. The group still hadn\u0027t been able to make any definite plans or work out the precise details of the afternoon\u0027s risky excursion out into the open. Their main aims had quickly been identified and agreed upon. The more practical points, however, had been knowingly overlooked.\\n\\n Where was the sense in trying to iron out fine details, they had decided, when no-one knew whether or not their main objectives were going to be achieved? Now that the men had succeeded in getting transport, the intentional shortfalls in their planning were unnerving and daunting. \u0027So what do we do now?\u0027 asked Croft as they drove towards the wiremesh enclosed football pitch. They could already see that the gate was closed. To get out and open it would be taking a huge risk and to smash through would open the entire area up to the wandering bodies. \u0027Just keep moving,\u0027 answered Cooper, swinging himself around and sitting back down. \u0027We\u0027re going to have to drive through the gate.\u0027 \u0027But we\u0027ll...\u0027 Croft began to protest. \u0027Go through, reverse up and we\u0027ll use the van to block off the entrance once the others are through.\u0027 \u0027So how are we going to get back inside if we\u0027re going to block the fucking exit?\u0027 Cooper shook his head, resigned and irritated by the doctor\u0027s obvious nerves. \u0027We\u0027re not going to be able to do anything for some time,\u0027 he explained, holding onto the sides of his seat as the van bumped and rocked as it ploughed through still more bodies. \u0027The noise we\u0027re making is going to bring thousands of these bloody things here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We could make a run for it.\u0027 \u0027We could, but I think we should sit tight and wait for a while. Doesn\u0027t matter if we don\u0027t get back inside for a couple of hours. Hopefully there will be fewer of them around by then.\\n\\n \u0027 Cooper braced himself as Croft accelerated towards the metal gate blocking the entrance to the football pitch. Steve Armitage watched from the larger of the two trucks following close behind. \u0027If he can\u0027t do it,\u0027 the lorry driver grunted, \u0027then I\u0027ll get through it with this thing.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll take half the bloody fence with you,\u0027 snapped Bernard Heath sitting next to him. As they had neared the university so Heath\u0027s nervousness and apprehension had increased considerably. He knew the time was coming for them to risk leaving their shelter. The four men following watched as the police van careered into the gate. The force of the impact was enough to twist and smash it out of shape, leaving the buckled metal barrier hanging half-open, held in place by one stubborn hinge. Croft reversed a few meters back and then drove forward again, forcing the remains of the gate to one side and driving onto the football pitch. Suddenly free and able to move without obstruction, the doctor turned the van around in a large circle. He watched with nervous fascination as the bodies began to arrive. The diseased shells collided with the rattling wire-mesh barrier around the entire perimeter of the football pitch. \u0027This is going to be tight,\u0027 Armitage muttered as he lined up the truck and drove through the space where the metal gate had been. An experienced driver, the sides of his vehicle missed the fence by little more than a few centimeters on either side. Seeing that the first truck had entered the football pitch unscathed gave Paul Castle a false faith in his own abilities. He forced the smaller truck forward and winced as the passenger side scraped along the gatepost.\\n\\n As soon as the last of the three vehicles was safe within the confines of the metal fence Croft parked the van across the width of the entrance, blocking access to the football pitch for the hundreds of staggering cadavers which dragged themselves towards the survivors. Steve Armitage parked his vehicle in the middle of the pitch. After obliterating three bodies which had managed to squeeze onto the playing field in the short time between the last vehicle entering and Croft closing the gap, Paul Castle did the same. \u0027Get out of sight,\u0027 Cooper ordered as he ran from the van towards the larger of the two trucks. \u0027Get in the back of this one.\u0027 All around the football pitch bodies continued to collide noisily and clumsily with the fence. Where between ten and twenty had stood moments before, now hundreds of ragged, bedraggled figures stood and smashed their rotting hands against the barrier, grabbing and shaking the wire-mesh and trying hopelessly to get at the survivors inside. Needing no further encouragement, the five other men followed Cooper into the back of the truck.\\n\\n Taking care not to fully shut the heavy, security locked door, the soldier collapsed down onto a nearby metal bench. \u0027Did it,\u0027 he said quietly. The military authority and direction previously so clear in his voice had suddenly been dropped and had been replaced with obvious relief. The other tired faces around him looked similarly relieved. \u0027So what do we do now?\u0027 Jack Baxter asked. \u0027Looks like we\u0027re stuck out here for a while.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s just take it easy,\u0027 the soldier replied. \u0027Nothing else to do but sit and wait.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-41.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
