{"id":112090,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Midday. Donna had managed to sleep for a few hours. It was the first time in a week she\u0027d had a proper bed and even though it was in a cold and unfamiliar place, it still felt reassuringly comfortable and safe. A man she hadn\u0027t seen before walked past the door to the room she\u0027d been sleeping in and, seeing that she was awake, stopped to talk to her. \u0027How you feeling?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Crap,\u0027 she replied with brutal honesty. \u0027I\u0027m Bernard Heath,\u0027 he said, taking a couple of steps into the room. \u0027Donna.\u0027 He nodded and, feeling suddenly awkward and not knowing what to say, looked around the room rather than stare at her lying on the bed. \u0027Look,\u0027 he said after a few long seconds had passed, \u0027would you like to come downstairs with me? I can get you some food or something to drink or...\u0027 Donna was up and on her feet before he\u0027d finished his question. She was starving. Heath led her along the corridor and down the stairs.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 she muttered under her breath as she walked into the assembly hall. She began to cry. She couldn\u0027t help herself. She\u0027d given up hope of ever seeing so many people together again. She counted between ten and twenty of them. In one corner a handful of subdued children played quietly. Elsewhere people sat around the edges of the room, generally keeping themselves to themselves. Heath fetched her some food from an adjourning kitchen. Standing in the middle of the hall with a tray in her hands, Donna suddenly felt exposed and vulnerable. She looked around for somewhere to sit and caught sight of Paul Castle sitting next to another man. Despite the fact that she still wanted to punch him in the face for the stupid stunt he\u0027d pulled this morning, he was the only other person that she knew.\\n\\n Wearily she dragged herself across the room and sat down next to him. \u0027You okay?\u0027 he asked. She nodded and grunted but didn\u0027t properly answer. She began to eat the crackers and cheese spread that she\u0027d been given. Her hands shook as she tried to spread with a plastic knife. It was bitterly cold inside the building. \u0027This is Steve,\u0027 Paul continued, introducing the man sitting next to him. \u0027Steve, this is Donna.\u0027 \u0027Hi, Donna,\u0027 Steve said wearily, managing half a smile. Donna managed another grunt. \u0027Steve says there\u0027s almost fifty people here you know,\u0027 Paul whispered. \u0027Thank God we found this place.\\n\\n He says that most of them don\u0027t...\u0027 \u0027Finding it wasn\u0027t difficult,\u0027 Donna said, swallowing a mouthful of food and finally finding enough energy and interest to bring herself to speak, \u0027it was getting here that was the hard part. It wouldn\u0027t have been so much of a problem if it hadn\u0027t been for you, you stupid bloody idiot!\u0027 Paul looked down at his feet and turned back to face Steve. \u0027So what\u0027s the plan?\u0027 he asked, trying desperately to ignore Donna\u0027s anger.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going to happen next? Are we staying here or...?\u0027 \u0027As far as I can tell there is no plan, mate,\u0027 Steve replied. \u0027And if there was you\u0027d only go and screw it up,\u0027 Donna snapped. Paul ignored her. \u0027Don\u0027t think anyone knows what to do next,\u0027 Steve continued. \u0027Seems like it\u0027s going to be as bad wherever you go so you might as well stay put. A couple of us have got a few ideas brewing though, haven\u0027t we, Nathan?\u0027 Nathan Holmes was walking across the hall on his way back to his room. At the mention of his name he stopped and turned round. Bored and glad of any distraction he pulled up a chair and sat down in front of Steve and Paul. \u0027What you talking about?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I said we\u0027re starting to get a few ideas about what to do next, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 Holmes\u0027 face cracked into a broad, knowing grin. \u0027Too right,\u0027 he said, his voice lowered to a whisper. \u0027What you going to do?\u0027 Paul asked. \u0027When those things outside start to drift away,\u0027 he explained, \u0027we\u0027re going out on the town.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I mean we\u0027re going to shut ourselves in one of the clubs round here and we\u0027re going to have the biggest fucking party you\u0027ve ever seen. We\u0027re going to blow all the drinks and drugs we can find in the place. And when they start to wear off and we start to come back down, we\u0027re going on to the next club and we\u0027re going to do it all over again. The biggest bloody pub crawl in history!\u0027 \u0027Sounds good,\u0027 Paul said, far from convinced. \u0027We\u0027re going to hit this town and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You been outside recently?\u0027 Donna interrupted. Holmes leant back on his chair to get a look at the woman who had interrupted him. \u0027Yeah, why?\u0027 he replied. \u0027Because there\u0027s nothing left out there, that\u0027s why,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Exactly. That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to do it. Nothing matters when you\u0027ve had a few drinks.\u0027 She shook her head sadly and returned her attention to her food. Holmes leant across and helped himself to a cracker. \u0027Do you mind?\u0027 she scowled. \u0027Not at all,\u0027 he replied in a smug, self-assured voice. \u0027Haven\u0027t seen you before,\u0027 he said, chewing on her food, \u0027when did you get here?\u0027 \u0027This morning.\u0027 \u0027You been out there all this time?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grim, ain\u0027t it?\u0027 Donna nodded. She didn\u0027t want to talk to Holmes. She didn\u0027t really want to talk to anyone, least of all this brash and irritating man. Much as she\u0027d craved company and conversation at times recently, she now needed space and time alone. Getting away from the office and finding the survivors had brought a brief respite from the cold emptiness of the remains of the world. It was only now that she\u0027d found a relatively safe and quiet shelter that the full horror of what had happened had returned to haunt her. With other survivors in close proximity for the first time she felt able to try and deal with her pain, fear and uncertainty. Although she needed other people close, she also needed to be by herself. She didn\u0027t really have anything against Holmes (she\u0027d put up with countless men like him in numerous bars and clubs before now), but at that moment she didn\u0027t want anything to do with him either. \u0027I tell you,\u0027 he continued, completely oblivious to Donna\u0027s lack of interest in him, \u0027there is no way I\u0027m sitting in here with this lot for much longer. Soon as I\u0027m ready I\u0027m getting out. We\u0027ve got the whole bloody country out there just waiting for us, isn\u0027t that right, Steve?\u0027 Steve nodded. \u0027Damn right.\u0027 Donna looked at the two men in disbelief.\\n\\n Was getting drunk really all that was left for them to do? With the world lying in tatters at their feet, did they not have any higher priorities? On one hand it seemed a sensible way to try and forget all that had happened and enjoy what time remained, but could their suggestion really be the only alternative? Given that she was surrounded by so much uncertainty she hadn\u0027t dared to start thinking about the future before now - until that moment she hadn\u0027t dared consider whether she even had a future to look forward to. Looking into Holmes\u0027 pathetic, grinning face, however, she knew that there had to be a better option than the seedy, selfish and dangerous escape that he and Steve Richards were planning for themselves. \u0027You can finish this,\u0027 she said as she stood up and dropped the tray of food on Holmes\u0027 lap.\\n\\n He turned and watched her as she walked away. \u0027Where you going?\u0027 he asked, getting up and following her. \u0027Somewhere else,\u0027 she grunted. \u0027Where\u0027s somewhere else?\u0027 \u0027Somewhere away from blokes like you.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve got some bad news for you,\u0027 he said, walking alongside her, \u0027blokes like me are all that\u0027s left.\u0027 Donna stopped walking and turned to face him. \u0027Listen,\u0027 she said quietly, \u0027I\u0027m twenty-four years old, I\u0027m female and I\u0027m blonde. I\u0027ve had to deal with fucking idiots like you for as long as I can remember. I\u0027ve seen hundreds of your type, full of mouth and fighting talk but you\u0027ve got no balls.\\n\\n If you\u0027re all that\u0027s left, I\u0027ll be spending the rest of my time on my own. Now will you leave me alone?\u0027 Not about to let her know if her words were having any effect on him, Holmes simply smirked. \u0027I\u0027ll see you around then,\u0027 he grinned. \u0027Fucking idiot,\u0027 Donna cursed as she stormed out of the hall and down the corridor back towards her room. She didn\u0027t even know if she\u0027d be able to find the room again but that wasn\u0027t important. She just needed to get away from the others for a while longer.\\n\\n Donna got lost in the accommodation block. The corridors looked the same, the rooms looked the same and the staircases looked the same. She remembered that her room was the third or fourth along from the stairs, but she couldn\u0027t remember whether it was on the second or third floor. She opened a third-floor door which looked vaguely familiar. It was instantly obvious that it wasn\u0027t her room - a young oriental man was sitting on the bed, staring into space. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she mumbled instinctively.\\n\\n \u0027I got the wrong room. I didn\u0027t mean to disturb...\u0027 He looked up at her and smiled for a moment. He looked so lost and helpless. Her heart immediately went out to the poor man. \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 she asked. He nodded. \u0027Have you had any food? Do you need me to show you where the hall is?\u0027 The man responded only with another smile and another nod of the head. \u0027No English,\u0027 he said simply.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m in the room next door,\u0027 Donna said slowly, pointing down the corridor and hoping that she was right. \u0027Let me know if you need anything, okay?\u0027 Another nod and another smile and Donna left the man alone and returned to her room. She lay down on the bed and closed her eyes tightly shut.\\n\\n For a while she couldn\u0027t get his face out of her head. As if everything that had happened wasn\u0027t hard enough already, this poor sod was having to cope with it all without being able to understand a word that the other survivors said. If she felt detached and alone, she thought, how the hell must he be feeling? Dark thoughts filled Donna\u0027s mind. The longer the silence in her room continued, the darker her thoughts became. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-18.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
