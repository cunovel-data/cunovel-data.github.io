One of the soldiers stepped forward. Cooper took a similar step forward to meet him. \u0027Sir!\u0027 he snapped instinctively, saluting and standing to attention.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t see who was behind the soldier\u0027s protective facemask. \u0027Cooper?\u0027 the faceless officer said with surprise clearly evident in his voice, despite it being muffled and distorted by the heavy breathing apparatus. \u0027Where the hell have you been, soldier? We thought you were long gone. Welcome back.\u0027 The weapons were lowered.\\n\\n No more words. Under continuous guard the survivors were crammed into a decontamination chamber.\\n\\n Those troops who had ventured out into the open with them laughed and joked in a similar chamber adjacent to the first. The initial relief and euphoria felt by the people from outside quickly disappeared. Exhausted and empty they sat and stared into space or slept or cried as their bodies were cleaned and every last trace of the disease was removed from them. Emma lay on a hard wooden bench, her head resting on Michael\u0027s lap. She looked up into his tired face and wondered what would happen next.\\n\\n Would the questions they\u0027d both been asking since the first morning of the nightmare finally be answered by someone in this cavernous base? Would someone be able to explain what had happened to their world? From the little that Cooper had been able to tell them, the decontamination process would last for more than a day.\\n\\n As the hours crept slowly by she drifted in and out of consciousness. Although still restless and uneasy in these new and alien surroundings, for the first time she was able to move and speak freely without fear of being hunted out and attacked by vicious bodies. No matter how highly trained they were, the soldiers with their guns and masks seemed to be nowhere near as much a threat as what remained of the rest of the population outside. These people, she hoped, were rational and controlled. The millions of decaying bodies on the surface were not.\\n\\n In order to conserve power the electric light in the decontamination chamber was switched off.\\n\\n Emma curled up with Michael and waited silently for the next day to arrive. Although she wasn\u0027t completely sure, she thought it would be Friday. Almost four weeks since it had begun. Almost two weeks since they\u0027d lost the farmhouse.\\n\\n Maybe tomorrow would be the day when everything would begin to make sense again. In the arms of the man who had come to mean everything to her, and surrounded by more survivors than she\u0027d ever thought she\u0027d see again, Emma relaxed and slept and began to feel human again.

After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
