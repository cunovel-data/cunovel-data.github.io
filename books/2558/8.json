{"id":112080,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Paul got up when the sun began to rise through the tenth floor windows of the office block. His movements weren\u0027t through choice, his temporary bed had proved less than comfortable and the pressure on his bladder had become too much to stand. Using a security pass which Donna had taken from a corpse earlier in the week, he dragged himself out onto the landing and climbed the single flight of stairs to the nearest toilet. Stumbling over an inert body in the halflight he crashed noisily through the door into the little room which was as cold, dark and unpleasant as he\u0027d imagined it would be. Another body was slumped on the ground in one of the cubicles and a musty, stagnant smell hung heavily in the air. Still drugged with sleep and hurrying to get away from the bodies and back to the office, Paul tripped again on his way out of the toilet, falling clumsily down the last three steps and kicking a cleaner\u0027s bucket against a radiator. The sound of metal on metal echoed up and down the entire length of the staircase, seeming for a few lingering moments to fill the entire building with noise. When he returned to the tenth floor Donna was awake. More than just awake she was up and alert, quickly changing her clothes and tying up her long hair. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 he asked, immediately concerned. She had no reason to get up so quickly. She had no real reason to get up at all.\\n\\n \u0027I heard something,\u0027 she replied breathlessly as she tucked her shirt into her jeans. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know. It was upstairs.\u0027 \u0027But you told me you\u0027ve already been upstairs, haven\u0027t you? You said there was nothing there.\u0027 \u0027Apart from a couple of bodies that\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027So what did you hear?\u0027 She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head. \u0027I don\u0027t know what it was. It sounded like...\u0027 \u0027It was me,\u0027 he interrupted nervously. \u0027It\u0027s still dark out there. I tripped over a body on my way up the stairs and I almost went right over on the way back down. I bet it...\u0027 He didn\u0027t bother to finish his sentence. Donna was still shaking her head. \u0027I heard the bloody noise you made,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027The sound I heard was before that.\u0027 An icy chill ran the length of Paul\u0027s spine. He watched with mounting anxiety as Donna put on a jacket and did up the zipper. She walked towards the door out of the office and stopped just a few feet short of the exit. \u0027Look,\u0027 she said, \u0027it was probably nothing.\\n\\n I\u0027m just going to go and have a look around. I\u0027ll only be a couple of minutes.\u0027 \u0027It must have been me you heard,\u0027 Paul continued to babble. \u0027Like I said, I kicked a bucket into a radiator. It made a hell of a noise.\u0027 Tired of listening to him moaning, Donna turned round, reached out for the door handle and then froze. Through the small glass panel in the door she could see a face staring back at her. Even though the light was poor she could tell that it was a cold, emotionless, rotting, dead face. The bloody thing was just stood there, staring at her. \u0027Christ,\u0027 she cursed as she stumbled back in surprise. \u0027What is it?\u0027 Paul hissed.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a body here,\u0027 she whispered, rooted to the spot. \u0027So?\u0027 \u0027So the damn thing\u0027s watching me!\u0027 \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027 He began to walk towards her, stopping short when he saw the corpse. Completely silent and otherwise unnervingly still, the only visible movement came from its misted eyes which moved from side to side, looking from Donna to Paul and back again. It hadn\u0027t been there when he\u0027d returned from the toilet minutes earlier. Could it have followed him? \u0027Why doesn\u0027t it go?\u0027 Donna asked. \u0027It should just wander away like the rest of them. Why\u0027s it staying here?\u0027 Paul crept forward slightly to get a better view of the cadaver on the landing. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he mumbled, \u0027maybe it\u0027s...\u0027 He stopped speaking immediately when the creature outside slowly lifted up a single diseased hand and smashed it down against the door.\\n\\n As the two survivors stood and watched in terrified disbelief, it thumped the door again. And again. And again. And again. And then with both hands, raining down a sudden torrent of weak, comparatively clumsy and completely unexpected blows on the door. \u0027I\u0027m going to let it in,\u0027 whispered Donna, her mouth dry and her pulse racing. \u0027What?\u0027 screamed Paul, unable to believe what he was hearing. \u0027What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing? You don\u0027t know what that thing will do if you let it in here...\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s going to do either,\u0027 she snapped back. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, this thing is trying to get to us. It wants help, it must do. This one\u0027s different to all the others I\u0027ve seen...\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t just assume that...\u0027 Paul\u0027s words were wasted. Donna wasn\u0027t listening and, besides, she\u0027d already made her decision. The body in front of her looked pathetic and emaciated. Its movements were slow and laboured. But more to the point, it appeared to have some level of control, and that separated it from the hundreds of other corpses she\u0027d seen. The creature continued to thump against the door. Donna flicked her pass at the sensor to her right and pulled the door open. The body dropped its arms and, for a second, stood still again. \u0027See,\u0027 she said, relieved.\\n\\n \u0027I told you it...\u0027 The creature lunged towards her, knocking her off balance and sending her thudding into the wall. With sudden energy - uncoordinated but unmistakably savage in intent - the remains of a rotting fifty-two year old man threw itself at Donna, its weak limbs flailing in the air around her face. Instinctively she lifted her hands to protect herself. Paul ran towards the obnoxious cadaver and grabbed it from behind, wincing in disgust as he tightened his grip and felt cold, hard, leathery flesh give way under the increasing pressure of his grip. With surprisingly little effort he yanked the body away and threw it down to the ground. Regardless of its unexpected speed and intent, it was still little more than a diseased and wasted shell. \u0027Bloody thing,\u0027 Donna spat. She pushed Paul to one side and stood over the corpse which was already struggling to pick itself up again. It leant over to one side and with claw-like, almost skeletal hands, made another lunge towards her. \u0027We\u0027ve got to kill it,\u0027 Paul wailed. \u0027How do we do that?\u0027 Emma yelled. \u0027Fucking thing\u0027s been dead since Tuesday.\u0027 It was only after she\u0027d spoken that she realised how ridiculous her words sounded. \u0027I don\u0027t know!\u0027 he screamed back at her. He looked around.\\n\\n Mounted on the wall just to the side of the entrance door was a fire extinguisher. He picked it up and raised it above his head. Donna, shaking with fear but fully aware of what Paul was doing, put one of her feet down hard on the creature\u0027s bony chest. Half of her body weight was more than enough to keep it pinned down. It didn\u0027t have the strength to reply. \u0027Do it,\u0027 she urged frantically. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, do it!\u0027\\n\\n Paul held the extinguisher high above the corpse. He watched its head thrashing helplessly from side to side with terrified fascination. Ashen, almost translucent skin was drawn tight across the emotionless face and its black, gaping mouth opened and closed continually without making a sound. \u0027Do it!\u0027 Donna screamed again. He couldn\u0027t move. Frozen. Terrified. Again the body tried to lunge and the sudden movement forced him into action. With his eyes screwed tightly shut Paul slammed the base of the metal cylinder down onto the head of the corpse on the ground. It hit the side of the face with a dull thud and a faint cracking sound as the cheekbone fractured. Slightly more confident in what he was doing, but with the sickening taste of bile rising in his throat, he lifted the fire extinguisher once again and hammered it down, this time smashing in the back of the skull. Finally the body lay still. \u0027Let\u0027s get it out of here,\u0027 he said as he dropped the extinguisher. Donna held the door open as he dragged the creature out by its feet, leaving behind it a thick trail of dark, almost black blood on the pale purple carpet.\\n\\n Driven by a nauseous combination of shock, fear and adrenaline, he dragged it out through the landing door and left it on the staircase. There were more bodies on the stairs. Jesus Christ, he could see another three of the damn things - one tripping down towards him from the floor above, two more dragging themselves up painfully slowly from the floor below.\\n\\n Filled with panic and cold fear he turned and sprinted back to the office.\\n\\n For more than an hour they were too afraid to move or even to make a sound. Hiding behind desks in the training room, Donna and Paul sat close together. Occasionally one of them would pluck up the courage to peer out into the main office again. They could just about see onto the landing through the precious doors which separated them from the rest of the world. Although indistinct and unclear, they could see movement outside. Donna sat upright and looked up and out of the window at the grey sky, trying to make some sense of what was happening. Paul lay on the carpet next to her, curled up in a ball. \u0027Why did it attack you?\u0027 he mumbled, finally able to bring himself to speak about what he\u0027d seen. \u0027Don\u0027t know for sure if it did.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean? Of course it attacked you!\u0027 \u0027Are you really sure? How do you know it wasn\u0027t trying to get us to help? How do you know...\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he whined, covering his head with his hands. \u0027All I do know is that you should never have opened the bloody door in the first place.\u0027 There was a sudden crash outside. It sounded like something falling down the stairs - the cleaner\u0027s bucket Paul had kicked earlier perhaps? He decided that one of the bodies must have tripped over it. \u0027It\u0027s like they\u0027re coming back to life,\u0027 Donna mumbled. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027They died last Tuesday. I know that\u0027s true because I watched it happen and I checked enough of my friends to know that they were all dead. And then they started to move. It\u0027s like they\u0027re beginning to function again. They walked on Thursday, now...\u0027 \u0027Now what?\u0027 \u0027How did they know we were here?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027I think you disturbed them when you went to the toilet.\u0027 \u0027But we\u0027ve both been off the floor before now, haven\u0027t we? How come they didn\u0027t react to us then? I walked past a hundred of those damn things outside on the streets and not one of them reacted...\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 she interrupted, growing increasingly annoyed by his mounting hysteria. \u0027That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m saying. They couldn\u0027t move, now they can walk. At first they had very little control and coordination, now that seems to have improved. They couldn\u0027t hear us and I don\u0027t know if they could see us before, but now it seems that they can.\u0027 \u0027But why did it attack you?\u0027 he asked again, repeating his earlier question. \u0027Did it attack me? If their control is limited, what else could it have done? It couldn\u0027t ask for help, could it? Christ, Paul, look what\u0027s happening to them. They\u0027re full of disease. Their bodies are beginning to rot and decay. Imagine the pain they must be feeling.\u0027 \u0027But can they feel it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. If they can move, my guess is that they must be able to feel something.\u0027 Paul sat up and drew his knees up tight to his chest. \u0027So what\u0027s going to happen next?\u0027 Donna shrugged her shoulders. Her head was spinning. She didn\u0027t want to think about it until she had to. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 she muttered. \u0027So what do we do?\u0027 \u0027For now we keep our heads down and we keep out of sight. Don\u0027t let them know we\u0027re in here.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-8.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \\n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \\n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \\n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
