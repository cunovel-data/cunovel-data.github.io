The range of drugs available to him had been desperately limited. He\u0027d pumped the devastated girl full of whatever he could find until she\u0027d finally stopped screaming and slipped into unconsciousness. Jack Baxter sat with Bernard Heath in a corner of the hall. Clare lay on a foam mattress next to them. They had talked intermittently for a few hours with neither man able to even contemplate sleep. In that time Baxter had been given the opportunity to ask some of the questions which had weighed heavy on his mind since last Tuesday morning. Heath, of course, had been unable to answer any of them, but the conversation seemed to have helped nevertheless. On hearing the news that the baby had died, Heath began to cry. He seemed ashamed by his show of emotion and tried unsuccessfully to hide his tears from Baxter. \u0027You know what this means, don\u0027t you?\u0027 he said after a few minutes of silence, his voice unsteady. \u0027What?\u0027 Baxter replied. \u0027It means that this is definitely the end.\u0027 \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s got to be over now, hasn\u0027t it? There are only a handful of us left now and it looks like we can\u0027t reproduce. So as far as I can see that\u0027s the end of the human race, Jack.\u0027 Baxter stared into the darkness. \u0027You can\u0027t be sure,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027We can\u0027t be sure about anything, but you\u0027ve got to admit, it doesn\u0027t look good, does it? I\u0027d started to think that there might have been some hope for us. I\u0027d been thinking that whatever makes people like you and I immune might make our children immune or our brothers or...\u0027 Tears began rolling freely down his tired face. \u0027You might still be right,\u0027 Baxter whispered. Heath shook his head. \u0027I\u0027ve got a son,\u0027 he continued, wiping his eyes again. \u0027He lives in Australia. My wife\u0027s been over there with them. She flew over three weeks ago to see the grandchildren. I know she\u0027s...\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s probably with them now,\u0027 he interrupted, anticipating what he was about to say and instinctively saying the opposite. \u0027For all you know they could be safe. It might only be this country that\u0027s affected. We might...\u0027 \u0027I know they\u0027re dead,\u0027 Heath interrupted sadly. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter what you say, I know they\u0027re dead.\u0027 Baxter rubbed his eyes and looked up at the ceiling. He knew what he was hearing was right. \u0027Until we know for certain though...\u0027 he began, about to try pointlessly to persuade Heath that there was still some hope. \u0027Don\u0027t waste your time, Jack,\u0027 Heath interrupted, sitting upright and staring into the other man\u0027s face. \u0027There\u0027s no point holding on to dreams or halfbaked ideas or...\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t just dismiss everything that...\u0027 \u0027Listen, can you really say you\u0027ve stopped to try and appreciate the scale of what\u0027s happened here?\u0027 \u0027Well I...\u0027 \u0027I hadn\u0027t. But something struck me a couple of days ago that puts all of this into perspective. Did you own a car?\u0027 \u0027Never learnt to drive,\u0027 Baxter answered, surprised by the question he\u0027d been asked. \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027I remember when I brought my first car home. My mother thought it was a death trap and my old dad spent the day outside with me trying to get the engine tuned. I\u0027ll never forget that day...\u0027 \u0027What point are you making?\u0027 \u0027How many crashed cars have you seen? How many abandoned cars have you seen round here?\u0027 \u0027Hundreds, probably thousands, why?\u0027 \u0027Because somebody owned every single one of them. Every single one of those cars was someone\u0027s pride and joy.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not sure I understand what you\u0027re saying...\u0027 \u0027What about your home? Did you own your house?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Remember the feeling when you picked up the key and walked inside? Remember your first night there when it was your house and you could shut the front door and forget about everyone else?\u0027 A faint smile crossed Jack\u0027s face as he remembered setting up home with his dear departed Denise. \u0027God, yes,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027We had such a laugh. We hardly had anything. We sat on boxes and ate chips from a...\u0027 \u0027Just think about the fact that someone had memories like that about every single house you\u0027ve passed, and chances are they\u0027re all dead now. Hundreds of them. Millions of them.\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t bare thinking about.\u0027 \u0027But we should think about it. And what about children? Did you have children, Jack?\u0027 He shook his head sadly. \u0027No, we wanted to but...\u0027 \u0027Every single corpse lying and rotting on the streets and every one of those bloody things outside this building, they were all somebody. They were all someone\u0027s son or daughter or brother or sister or...\u0027 Heath stopped talking again. More tears trickled from his tired eyes. \u0027You okay?\u0027 Jack asked, hesitantly. He shook his head. \u0027This is the end,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I tell you there\u0027s no doubt about it, this is the end.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-15.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
