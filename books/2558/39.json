Just look at them!\u0027 Donna had been sitting silently on the stairs holding her head in her hands, waiting impatiently and anxiously for the men to return.\n They had been gone for almost an hour. She got up and slowly walked over to where Clare was standing. \u0027Bloody hell...\u0027 she gasped as she stared into the mayhem below.\n The bodies were moving with more force and speed than she\u0027d ever seen before. Those nearest the centre of the city were continuing to break away from the main group and were stumbling away from the university complex in the general direction in which the six survivors had disappeared earlier.\n This wasn\u0027t any random coincidence. It was obvious that the corpses were moving with a purpose and a new found drive.\n And as the figures continued to stagger away, so more and more of them followed. \u0027What\u0027s happening to them?\u0027 Clare asked. \u0027What are they doing?\u0027 Down in the middle of the crowd she could see bodies beginning to fight with others to move through the immense gathering.\n \u0027It\u0027s like they\u0027re waking up,\u0027 Donna replied under her breath. In horror she pressed her face against the cold glass and watched the shadowy figures continue to move. In some ways it was almost as if they were beginning to herd like wild animals. Their movements were unerringly similar to a shoal of fish or a flock of migrating birds slowed down to a fraction of their natural pace. The implications were devastating. \u0027Where are you going?\u0027\n Clare wondered as Donna moved back towards the staircase. Her voice was trembling and light. \u0027Back down to the others. Coming?\u0027 Clare didn\u0027t move. \u0027Do you think they\u0027re going to be able to get back...\u0027\n Donna shook her head and answered abruptly. \u0027I don\u0027t know. There are thousands and thousands of those bloody things out there.\n All it\u0027s going to take is for one of the men to get caught and...\u0027\n \u0027But why is this happening? Why have they started to behave like this now?\u0027\n Donna shrugged her shoulders. \u0027Who knows,\u0027 she replied. \u0027Whatever the reason, we need to get away from this place as soon as we can.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-39.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
