I remember hearing the first few people starting to panic around me but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight. All I could think about was the speed. I mean, we were just minutes away from the station and the driver hadn\u0027t started slowing down. I\u0027ve done that journey five times a week virtually every week for the last eighteen months and I\u0027ve got to know where the train should start slowing down and where the brakes should kick in and...\u0027 He stopped talking and turned to look out of the window at the darkness outside. Donna and Paul were sitting in the training room, both still trying to get used to the fact that they had found someone else alive.\n `So what did you do?\u0027 Donna asked. `By then people were dying,\u0027 he continued, wiping a tear from the corner of his eye and hoping that she hadn\u0027t seen him. `Everywhere I looked they were just dropping and dying around me. I knew we were going to crash. I wasn\u0027t thinking about what was happening to the rest of them, I just got down on the floor and covered my head with my hands and...\u0027 `And...?\u0027 `And we hit something, but we got away with it lightly. Nothing seemed to happen for ages and then I felt the impact.\n It was a real fucking wrench. It threw me right forward and I could hear metal groaning and snapping and breaking. I swear I\u0027d have been badly injured if it wasn\u0027t for the bodies. There were so many of them they were like padding all around me. Once the train had stopped I managed to smash my way out through a window. When I got out I saw that we\u0027d gone into the back of another train that was still at the platform. Christ knows how we managed to stay on the rails.\u0027\n `Were you hurt?\u0027 `I did this,\u0027 Paul replied, lifting his shirt and turning around to show her his back. Even though the light was poor Donna could clearly see a huge purple and brown bruise running diagonally across the entire width of his back. `Painful?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. `Not really,\u0027 he replied. `Truth is I\u0027ve hardly thought about it since everything happened.\u0027 `So what did you do next?\u0027 `I went to work. Christ, there\u0027s conditioning for you. I didn\u0027t know what else to do. I mean, I couldn\u0027t get home and I couldn\u0027t think of anywhere else to go. I figured that if I was at work then I\u0027d at least have some shelter and protection. I knew where everything was.\u0027\n `I know what you mean. That\u0027s why I\u0027m still here.\u0027 `You worked here?\u0027 She nodded. `Typical, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 Paul grinned. `You spend most of your life trying to get out of work then you end up trapped there when everything goes belly-up.\u0027 `So was there anyone else around when you got there?\u0027 `There were plenty of people there,\u0027 he replied, `but no-one else was alive. Jesus, all the people I\u0027d been working with just the day before were dead. All those people that I\u0027d known for ages just gone... You get to know the people you work with, don\u0027t you? I had mates there and we\u0027d been out drinking at the weekend and now they\u0027re...\u0027 He stopped talking and looked up at the ceiling to avoid eye contact before losing control and starting to cry again. Donna sat and watched from the other side of a wide grey desk. She said and felt nothing. Somehow she had managed to distance herself from the pain.\n Perhaps it was the shock of everything that had happened? Whatever the reason, inside she felt as dead as the thousands of bodies lying and rotting on the streets. It was as if every nerve in her body had been cauterised. She didn\u0027t seem to feel anything anymore. She knew that was a bad thing but, at that moment, it helped. `Have some food,\u0027 she said, unable to think of anything else to say. She pushed a packet of biscuits across the desk. Paul shook his head. `You should eat something.\u0027 `No thanks.\u0027 `Drink?\u0027 She offered him a half-empty bottle of water. He nodded and wiped his face on his sleeve before taking the bottle from her and drinking thirstily. `So what do we do now?\u0027 he asked as he screwed the lid of the bottle back on and passed it back. Donna shrugged her shoulders. `Don\u0027t know,\u0027 she replied bluntly. `I mean we can\u0027t just sit here, can we?\u0027\n `What else is there to do?\u0027 `Christ, we should do something. We should get out there and find other people. See if we can actually find someone who knows what\u0027s going on...\u0027 `Bloody hell, I haven\u0027t seen anyone else alive apart from you. I haven\u0027t found anyone who\u0027s still breathing, so what chance have we got of finding anyone who knows what\u0027s happened?\u0027 `I know, but I...\u0027 `Look, I don\u0027t want to go out until I have to,\u0027 she continued, interrupting.\n `Until I know what\u0027s caused all of this I want to stay as far away as I can from those bloody things out there.\u0027 Her voice was cold, flat and tired and her message abrupt and definite. Paul didn\u0027t bother trying to argue. He got up and made himself a makeshift bed from clothes and blankets underneath a desk. He lay there in silence and stared up into the darkness for hours. Donna sat in her chair and did the same. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-6.html","bookId":2558,"book":{"id":2558,"title":"Autumn: The City (Autumn #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Autumn: The City (Autumn #2) \n A bastard hybrid of War of the Worlds and Night of the Living Dead, the Autumn series chronicles the struggle of a small group of survivors forced to contend with a world torn apart by a deadly disease. After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by \"phase two\" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1... \n While the first Autumn novel focused on those who escaped the city, Autumn: The City focuses on those who didn\u0027t. \n Without ever using the \u0027Z\u0027 word, the Autumn series offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There\u0027s no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore\u0027s sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero\u0027s classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.jpg","author":"David Moody","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:14 AM"}}
