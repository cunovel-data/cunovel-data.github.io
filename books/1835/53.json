He kissed her passionately, letting her know how much he loved her. “Marry me, Laurant. Put me out of my misery.” Her head snapped back. She was suddenly looking stunned again. “How did you get here?” He wouldn’t let her dodge his question. “Marry me,” he repeated. She smiled. “I want babies.” “So do I,” he said. “With you, I want everything. I’ll be a neurotic father, worrying about them, but with you as their mother, they’ll turn out all right. We’ll be a good balance for them. As long as I have you by my side, anything is possible. I love you, sweetheart.” She was fervently kissing his neck. “I already know you love me.” “Yeah? When did you figure that out?” She hoped their babies would have his blue eyes. They were so beautiful. “When I saw you at my door. That’s when I knew you loved me. You got on a plane and flew across an ocean for me.” He laughed. “Losing you was more terrifying. Besides, it wasn’t all that bad.” “Are you telling me you’re over your phobia?” “Sure I am,” he choked. She smiled, kissed him gently, and whispered. “We’ll go home by boat.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-53.html","bookId":1835,"book":{"id":1835,"title":"Heartbreaker (Buchanan-Renard #1)","description":"Storyline: Bless me father, for I will sin...
