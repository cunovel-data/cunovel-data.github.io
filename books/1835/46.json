{"id":89804,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"Nick and Noah moved under the balcony to get out of the way when the double doors opened behind them and two strapping men rolled in a baby grand piano on a dolly.\\n\\n “Where do you want this, Father?” one of the men asked Noah.\\n\\n “I don’t know,” Noah replied.\\n\\n “Geez, Father. This thing’s heavy. Could you find out for us?”\\n\\n Justin hurried down the aisle toward them. He was carrying a video camera and had a long, red extension cord looped over his shoulder. He slowed to say hello.\\n\\n “Do you know where the piano’s supposed to go?” Noah asked him.\\n\\n “Sure I do,” he answered. “They’re putting the choir on the south side of the church in that little alcove.”\\n\\n He backed out of the way so the men could roll the piano around to the side aisle.\\n\\n “How come they don’t just use the organ?” Noah asked.\\n\\n Justin turned to answer. “They have to get those pipes cleaned first. The abbot says all the dust in the air will mess up the chords if it isn’t cleaned before it’s used again.”\\n\\n “What are you doing with the video camera?” Nick asked.\\n\\n “I’ve been roped into filming the ceremony from the balcony,” he explained. “Michelle’s father asked me. He’s already got a professional guy filming downstairs, but he wants all the angles covered I guess. I don’t mind doing it,” he added, grinning. “He’s paying me a hundred dollars, and I can use the money. Besides that, he’s invited Mark and Willie and me to the reception, and we’ll get free food and beer. You coming to the wedding?” he asked Nick.\\n\\n “Wouldn’t miss it,” he answered.\\n\\n “See you later then,” Justin said as he raced on. “I just hope the church is ready. We’ve got a heck of a lot of work to get done before seven.”\\n\\n They moved out of the way again so Justin could open the wrought iron gate and go up the stairs to the balcony.\\n\\n “Okay, what were you going to tell me?” Noah asked as he followed Nick to the back pew.\\n\\n “It doesn’t feel right.”\\n\\n “Brenner?”\\n\\n Nick nodded. “Maybe I’ll be convinced when I hear the reports. They’ve got a thumbprint, a partial anyway, and they’re working on a voice match with the confessional tape. When the results are in confirming Brenner’s the unsub, then I’ll relax. Until then . . .”\\n\\n “You want me to stay.”\\n\\n “Yes. I know Pete’s going to be calling you with another assignment—”\\n\\n “I’ll try to fend him off. Besides, we’re going to hear what the techs have concluded by tonight. Tomorrow at the latest.”\\n\\n “I really appreciate this, Noah.”\\n\\n “If it doesn’t feel right to you, then of course I’m staying. Do I have to keep wearing this dress?”\\n\\n Nick smiled. “You probably should keep wearing it until you leave Holy Oaks. Too many people know you as a priest. Let’s leave it that way.”\\n\\n He looked Noah up and down and then asked, “Where are you hiding your gun? Ankle strap?” he guessed as he glanced down at Noah’s feet. The tips of his black tennis shoes were protruding from the hem of the long robe.\\n\\n “Too hard to get to,” Noah answered. He lifted the full sleeve covering his left arm. The holster holding the gun was strapped just below his elbow. “Thank God for Velcro.”\\n\\n “Nice,” Nick said.\\n\\n “Tell me something. Don’t you think you should tell Tom and Laurant you still have reservations?”\\n\\n “What am I going to tell them? The evidence is pretty conclusive, and God only knows what else Wesson has on Brenner. Besides, Laurant and Tommy have been living under a tremendous strain, and Laurant’s been looking forward to her friend’s wedding. I want her to be able to enjoy herself tonight. You keep your eye on Tommy, and I’ll watch out for her.”\\n\\n “No, I’m not going to work that way. You do what you want with Laurant, but I’m telling Tom to stay sharp. I don’t want him to relax until you’re convinced.”\\n\\n Nick nodded. “Yeah, okay.”\\n\\n “Did you tell Pete how you’re feeling about this?”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “And?”\\n\\n Nick shoved his hands in his pockets. “I’m not being objective because I’m too personally involved.”\\n\\n “He could be right.”\\n\\n “When the reports are in, I’ll stop worrying.”\\n\\n “Then what?”\\n\\n “We go home,” Nick said. “Another day, another case.”\\n\\n “You’re just going to walk away from her, aren’t you?” Noah sounded incredulous. “She’s the best thing that ever happened to you, but you’re too chicken to take the chance. You’re nuts. You know that?”\\n\\n Nick responded to the question by turning around and walking away from his friend.\\n\\n CHAPTER 34\\n\\n Michelle’s father returned from the abbey at a quarter of six to report that the scaffolding had been removed, and the red carpet had been rolled down the center aisle. The florist and her assistant were frantically working to tie the bouquets to the ends of each pew. It would be close, he told his wife, but he was sure the church would be ready when the wedding march began.\\n\\n Michelle’s mother, a vision in blue chiffon, continued to worry, but the bride took all the last-minute wrinkles in stride. She sat on the bed with her back against the headboard and watched Laurant dress while she caught her friend up on the latest gossip she’d heard.\\n\\n “They’ve got an APB or a ABP—whatever it is—out on Lonnie now. They’re going to charge him with arson and hopefully lock him away for the rest of his life. He’s gotten away with so much in the past couple of years. He deserves to rot in prison.” She paused to take a sip of lemonade. “And everyone is still in shock about Steve. Don’t pin your hair up, Laurant. Leave it down.”\\n\\n “Okay,” Laurant agreed. She picked up the peach silk dress she’d draped over the chair and slipped it on. She had her back to Michelle as she zipped the dress up and adjusted the bodice. Then she turned around, the full skirt floating about her ankles. “What do you think? Does this work or not? I could wear the blue Versace, but I thought this color would blend better with the dark pink dresses the other bridesmaids are wearing.”\\n\\n Mrs. Brockman walked into the bedroom to try once again to hurry her daughter along. She came to an abrupt stop when she saw Laurant.\\n\\n Both mother and daughter appeared to be speechless. Laurant felt self-conscious under their close scrutiny. “Say something, Michelle,” she demanded. “Do you like the dress or not?”\\n\\n “You look like a princess in a fairy tale,” Michelle whispered. “Doesn’t she, Mother?”\\n\\n “Oh yes,” she agreed. “My dear, you look exquisite.”\\n\\n Michelle awkwardly scooted off the bed and held on to the post as she stood. Her mother noticed her grimace. “Is the new brace still bothering you?”\\n\\n “A little,” Michelle admitted. Her gaze was locked on Laurant. “If I could look like that . . . Turn around and look in the mirror. Mother, Laurant doesn’t have any idea how beautiful she is. She doesn’t see herself the way the rest of the world does. I should make her wear a grocery sack over her head because every eye in the church is going to be on her.”\\n\\n “No, they’ll be staring at the beautiful bride.” Laurant laughed then. “Well, you will be beautiful as soon as you get your hair out of those ridiculous jumbo rollers and put some clothes on. Or were you planning to wear that old robe down the aisle?”\\n\\n “Yes, that’s it, Laurant. Hurry her along. She won’t listen to me, and she’s going to be late for her own wedding,” Mrs. Brockman said as she turned Michelle around and gave her a gentle nudge. “I’m too old for this stress,” she added. “I was already old when I had Michelle,” she reminded them.\\n\\n Michelle grinned. “Yes, Mother. I was your change of life baby, and I changed your life.”\\n\\n Her mother smiled. “You’ve been a blessing. Now get dressed, or I’m going to send your father in here.”\\n\\n Michelle tightened the belt on her robe and began to pull the Velcro rollers out of her hair.\\n\\n “Laurant, your bra’s showing,” she said. “Just below the straps.”\\n\\n Laurant tugged on the bodice, but the white lace continued to show. “I don’t have any other bras with me.”\\n\\n “Then don’t wear one,” Michelle suggested.\\n\\n Her mother gasped. “Laurant will not go braless into the house of God.”\\n\\n “Mother, I’m not suggesting she go topless. No one will know if she’s wearing a bra or not. The dress is lined.”\\n\\n “God will know,” her mother announced. “I’ll get the safety pins.”\\n\\n As soon as the door closed, Michelle said, “She’s a nervous wreck, and so is Daddy. He got all teary-eyed this morning. He told me he was losing his little girl. Isn’t that sweet?”\\n\\n Laurant pulled out the chair for Michelle so she could sit at the vanity table.\\n\\n “Yes, it is sweet,” she said. “Did you remind him that you and Christopher will be living two blocks away?”\\n\\n “It’s not the same,” she said. “He’s going to cry when he walks me down the aisle, and I’ll be crying too if the church isn’t ready.”\\n\\n Laurant picked up the brush and handed it to her friend. “Do you realize how lucky you are? You have such wonderful, loving parents, and you’re about to marry the most wonderful man. I envy you,” she added in a sigh.\\n\\n Michelle looked at her friend in the mirror. “It won’t be long before I’m helping you get ready for your wedding.”\\n\\n Laurant could have told her the truth then, that it had all been a lie and that she and Nick weren’t getting married, but she kept silent. Today was Michelle’s day, and Laurant didn’t want her friend to waste a minute thinking about anything else.\\n\\n “Don’t you get all emotional on me,” Michelle said. “Or mother will put you to work too. That’s how she deals with tears,” she explained. “She had poor Dad running all over town. She’s already made him make two trips up to the abbey. First, she made him go see for himself that the scaffolding was down. Then, she made him go back to make sure the flowers had arrived. And before he drives us to the church, he has to drive over to the Vandermans and pick up Bessie Jean and Viola.”\\n\\n “Bessie Jean has a car.”\\n\\n “Have you ever seen her drive it?”\\n\\n “No, but I’ve seen the car parked in her garage.”\\n\\n “She doesn’t want to drive. She wants to be chauffeured. She told mother, with so much traffic these days, it’s too dangerous.”\\n\\n “Traffic in Holy Oaks?”\\n\\n They burst into laughter. “And get this,” Michelle said. “She blames the Catholics. Says we drive like maniacs.”\\n\\n They laughed again, but Michelle’s mother put an end to the conversation when she came rushing into the bedroom once more. “Michelle, I’m begging you now. Get dressed.” She headed for Laurant, brandishing two giant safety pins. “These were all I could find,” she said apologetically as she pinned Laurant’s bra to the lining of her dress.\\n\\n Michelle was finally ready to leave for the church at twenty minutes to seven. Her beaded ivory wedding gown was a replica of a Vera Wang design she had seen in a magazine and had fallen in love with. It fit her petite hourglass frame perfectly. When she finally turned to face her mother and Laurant, they both grabbed Kleenex to dab at their eyes and wipe their noses.\\n\\n “Oh, Michelle, you look beautiful,” Laurant whispered. “Absolutely beautiful.”\\n\\n “Your daddy’s going to cry when he sees you,” her mother announced, sniffling.\\n\\n Michelle adjusted her veil, then squeezed Laurant’s hand. “Okay, I’m ready. Let’s go.”\\n\\n As she was walking to the door, she called over her shoulder, “Don’t forget to wear the necklace I gave you.”\\n\\n Laurant would have forgotten it if she hadn’t been reminded. At the rehearsal dinner Michelle had given to all the bridesmaids a delicate gold chain as a gift.\\n\\n It took her several tries to get the necklace fastened. Then she stood in front of the full-length mirror and put on her diamond-studded earrings. The only other piece of jewelry she had on was the engagement ring. She held her hand out in front of her and stared down at the shimmering diamond for a long moment. Tears blurred her vision. Her heart felt as though it were breaking. She thought about taking the ring off and giving it back to Nick right away, but then she changed her mind. She would wait until after the reception. Then she would give him the ring and say good-bye.\\n\\n Dear God, how was she ever going to get through that? Oh, how she loved him. He had come into her life and changed it forever, for he’d made her open her eyes and her heart to the world around her, and to all the possibilities.\\n\\n How was she ever going to live the rest of her life without him? Laurant stared at herself in the mirror and slowly straightened her shoulders. Her heart would be broken, yes, but she would survive.\\n\\n Alone, once again.\\n\\n CHAPTER 35\\n\\n The church was packed. Everyone who lived in Holy Oaks must have been invited to the wedding, Nick decided as he stood in the back of the church, watching the people stream in. Several families tried to go upstairs, but the iron gate that led to the balcony was locked, and there was a hand-printed sign above simply stating, DO NOT ENTER. Some of them tried to jiggle the lock loose and go upstairs, but then they gave up and went searching for a seat inside the main church.\\n\\n Two ushers were urging guests to move closer together so that more people could squeeze into the pews even as the mother of the bride was being escorted down to the front row.\\n\\n Nick was trying to stay out of the way. Laurant was with the bridal party in the vestibule below the balcony. The door was open, but the bride couldn’t be seen. Nick watched Laurant open the closet door and put her purse on the shelf inside. She caught his eye as she was turning around, gave him a hesitant smile, and then walked out of sight.\\n\\n Michelle’s father had partially closed the double doors leading into the church so that the wedding party could line up and not be seen. He stood with his hand on the doorknob, peeking inside as he waited for Father Tom to come out of the sacristy and take his place in front of the altar. Worried and flustered that he would forget what he was supposed to do or that he would trip on his daughter’s dress and send her flying, he began to pant with anxiety. In a few minutes, he was going to be giving his only daughter away. He reached into the vest pocket of his rented tux and pulled out his handkerchief. It was while he was mopping his brow that he remembered the Vanderman sisters. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-46.html","bookId":1835,"book":{"id":1835,"title":"Heartbreaker (Buchanan-Renard #1)","description":"Storyline: Bless me father, for I will sin... \\n In the still shadows of the confessional, a madman tauntingly reveals his plan for a murder he is going to commit, pulling Father Thomas Madden into a twisted game by disclosing his next intended victim: Tom\u0027s sister, Laurant.
