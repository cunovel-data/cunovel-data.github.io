Fanny stood before it, key in hand (she had found it in the mail box, tied to a string), and she had a curious and restful feeling, as if she had come home, after long wanderings. She smiled, whimsically, and repeated her lesson to herself: \n \n “The fire\u0027s laid in the fireplace with fat pine knots that will blaze up at the touch of a match. My books are there, along the wall. The bedding\u0027s in the cedar chest, and the lamps are filled. There\u0027s tinned stuff in the pantry. And the mountains are there, girl, to make you clean and whole again....” \n \n She stepped up to the little log-pillared porch and turned the key in the lock. She opened the door wide, and walked in. And then she shut her eyes for a moment. Because, if it shouldn\u0027t be true—— \n \n But there was a fire laid with fat pine knots. She walked straight over to it, and took her box of matches from her bag, struck one, and held it to the wood. They blazed like a torch. Books! Along the four walls, books. Fat, comfortable, used-looking books. Hundreds of them. A lamp on the table, and beside it a pipe, blackened from much use. Fanny picked it up, smiling. She held it a moment in her hand, as though she expected to find it still warm. \n \n “It\u0027s like one of the fairy tales,” she thought, “the kind that repeats and repeats. The kind that says, `and she went into the next room, and it was as the good fairy had said.\u0027” \n \n There\u0027s tinned stuff in the pantry. She went into the tiny kitchen and opened the pantry door cautiously, being wary of mice. But it met her eye in spotless array. Orderly rows of tins. Orderly rows of bottles. Coffee. Condensed milk. Beans. Spaghetti. Flour. Peaches. Pears. \n \n Off the bedroom there was an absurdly adequate little bathroom, with a zinc tub and an elaborate water-heating arrangement. \n \n Fanny threw back her head and laughed as she hadn\u0027t laughed in months. “Wild life in the Rockies,” she said aloud. She went back to the book-lined living room. The fire was crackling gloriously. It was a many-windowed room, and each window framed an enchanting glimpse of mountain, flaming with aspens up to timber-line, and snow-capped at the top. Fanny decided to wait until the fire had died down to a coal-bed. Then she banked it carefully, put on a heavy sweater and a cap, and made for the outdoors. She struck out briskly, tenderfoot that she was. In five minutes she was panting. Her heart was hammering suffocatingly. Her lungs ached. She stopped, trembling. Then she remembered. The altitude, of course. Heyl had boasted that his cabin stood at an altitude of over nine thousand feet. Well, she would have to get used to it. But she was soon striding forward as briskly as before. She was a natural mountain dweller. The air, the altitude, speeded up her heart, her lungs, sent the blood dancing through her veins. Figuratively, she was on tip-toe. \n \n They had warned her, at the Inn, to take it slowly for the first few days. They had asked no questions. Fanny learned to heed their advice. She learned many more things in the next few days. She learned how to entice the chipmunks that crossed her path, streak o\u0027 sunshine, streak o\u0027 shadow. She learned to broil bacon over a fire, with a forked stick. She learned to ride trail ponies, and to bask in a sun-warmed spot on a wind-swept hill, and to tell time by the sun, and to give thanks for the beauty of the world about her, and to leave the wild flowers unpicked, to put out her campfire with scrupulous care, and to destroy all rubbish (your true woodsman and mountaineer is as painstakingly neat as a French housewife). \n \n She was out of doors all day. At night she read for a while before the fire, but by nine her eyelids were heavy. She walked down to the Inn sometimes, but not often. One memorable night she went, with half a dozen others from the Inn, to the tiny one-room cabin of Oscar, the handy man about the Inn, and there she listened to one of Oscar\u0027s far-famed phonograph concerts. Oscar\u0027s phonograph had cost twenty-five dollars in Denver. It stood in one corner of his cabin, and its base was a tree stump just five hundred years old, as you could tell for yourself by counting its rings. His cabin walls were gorgeous with pictures of Maxine Elliott in her palmy days, and blonde and sophisticated little girls on vinegar calendars, posing bare-legged and self-conscious in blue calico and sunbonnets. You sat in the warm yellow glow of Oscar\u0027s lamp and were regaled with everything from the Swedish National Anthem to Mischa Elman\u0027s tenderest crooning. And Oscar sat rapt, his weather-beaten face a rich deep mahogany, his eyes bluer than any eyes could ever be except in contrast with that ruddy countenance, his teeth so white that you found yourself watching for his smile that was so gently sweet and childlike. Oh, when Oscar put on his black pants and issued invitations for a musical evening one was sure to find his cabin packed. Eight did it, with squeezing. \n \n This, then, was the atmosphere in which Fanny Brandeis found herself. As far from Haynes-Cooper as anything could be. At the end of the first week she found herself able to think clearly and unemotionally about Theodore, and about Fenger. She had even evolved a certain rather crude philosophy out of the ruins that had tumbled about her ears. It was so crude, so unformed in her mind that it can hardly be set down. To justify one\u0027s own existence. That was all that life held or meant. But that included all the lives that touched on yours. It had nothing to do with success, as she had counted success heretofore. It was service, really. It was living as—well, as Molly Brandeis had lived, helpfully, self-effacingly, magnificently. Fanny gave up trying to form the thing that was growing in her mind. Perhaps, after all, it was too soon to expect a complete understanding of that which had worked this change in her from that afternoon in Fenger\u0027s library. \n \n After the first few days she found less and less difficulty in climbing. Her astonished heart and lungs ceased to object so strenuously to the unaccustomed work. The Cabin Rock trail, for example, whose summit found her panting and exhausted at first, now seemed a mere stroll. She grew more daring and ambitious. One day she climbed the Long\u0027s Peak trail to timberline, and had tea at Timberline Cabin with Albert Edward Cobbins. Albert Edward Cobbins, Englishman, erstwhile sailor, adventurer and gentleman, was the keeper of Timberline Cabin, and the loneliest man in the Rockies. It was his duty to house overnight climbers bound for the Peak, sunrise parties and sunset parties, all too few now in the chill October season-end. Fanny was his first visitor in three days. He was pathetically glad to see her. \n \n “I\u0027ll have tea for you,” he said, “in a jiffy. And I baked a pan of French rolls ten minutes ago. I had a feeling.” \n \n A magnificent specimen of a man, over six feet tall slim, broad-shouldered, long-headed, and scrubbed-looking as only an Englishman can be, there was something almost pathetic in the sight of him bustling about the rickety little kitchen stove. \n \n “To-morrow,” said Fanny, over her tea, “I\u0027m going to get an early start, reach here by noon, and go on to Boulder Field and maybe Keyhole.” \n \n “Better not, Miss. Not in October, when there\u0027s likely to be a snowstorm up there in a minute\u0027s notice.” \n \n “You\u0027d come and find me, wouldn\u0027t you? They always do, in the books.” \n \n “Books are all very well, Miss. But I\u0027m not a mountain man. The truth is I don\u0027t know my way fifty feet from this cabin. I got the job because I\u0027m used to loneliness, and don\u0027t mind it, and because I can cook, d\u0027you see, having shipped as cook for years. But I\u0027m a seafaring man, Miss. I wouldn\u0027t advise it, Miss. Another cup of tea?” \n \n But Long\u0027s Peak, king of the range, had fascinated her from the first. She knew that the climb to the summit would be impossible for her now, but she had an overwhelming desire to see the terrifying bulk of it from a point midway of the range. It beckoned her and intrigued her, as the difficult always did. \n \n By noon of the following day she had left Albert Edward\u0027s cabin (he stood looking after her in the doorway until she disappeared around the bend) and was jauntily following the trail that led to Boulder Field, that sea of jagged rock a mile across. Soon she had left the tortured, wind-twisted timberline trees far behind. How pitiful Cabin Rock and Twin Sisters looked compared to this. She climbed easily and steadily, stopping for brief rests. Early in the week she had ridden down to the village, where she had bought climbing breeches and stout leggings. She laughed at Albert Edward and his fears. By one o\u0027clock she had reached Boulder Field. She found the rocks glazed with ice. Just over Keyhole, that freakish vent in a wall of rock, the blue of the sky had changed to the gray of snow-clouds. Tenderfoot though she was, she knew that the climb over Boulder Field would be perilous, if not impossible. She went on, from rock to rock, for half an hour, then decided to turn back. A clap of thunder, that roared and crashed, and cracked up and down the canyons and over the peaks, hastened her decision. She looked about her. Peak on peak. Purple and black and yellow masses, fantastic in their hugeness. Chasms. Canyons. Pyramids and minarets. And so near. So grim. So ghastly desolate. And yet so threatening. And then Fanny Brandeis was seized with mountain terror. It is a disease recognized by mountain men everywhere, and it is panic, pure and simple. It is fear brought on by the immensity and the silence of the mountains. A great horror of the vastness and ruggedness came upon her. It was colossal, it was crushing, it was nauseating. \n \n She began to run. A mistake, that, when one is following a mountain trail, at best an elusive thing. In five minutes she had lost the trail. She stopped, and scolded herself sternly, and looked about her. She saw the faint trail line again, or thought she saw it, and made toward it, and found it to be no trail at all. She knew that she must be not more than an hour\u0027s walk from Timberline Cabin, and Albert Edward, and his biscuits and tea. Why be frightened? It was absurd. But she was frightened, horribly, harrowingly. The great, grim rock masses seemed to be shaking with silent laughter. She began to run again. She was very cold, and a piercing wind had sprung up. She kept on walking, doggedly, reasoning with herself quite calmly, and proud of her calmness. Which proves how terrified she really was. Then the snow came, not slowly, not gradually, but a blanket of it, as it does come in the mountains, shutting off everything. And suddenly Fanny\u0027s terror vanished. She felt quite free from weariness. She was alive and tingling to her fingertips. The psychology of fear is a fascinating thing. Fanny had reached the second stage. She was quite taken out of herself. She forgot her stone-bruised feet. She was no longer conscious of cold. She ran now, fleetly, lightly, the ground seeming to spur her on. She had given up the trail completely now. She told herself that if she ran on, down, down, down, she must come to the valley sometime. Unless she was turned about, and headed in the direction of one of those hideous chasms. She stopped a moment, peering through the snow curtain, but she could see nothing. She ran on lightly, laughing a little. Then her feet met a projection, she stumbled, and fell flat over a slab of wood that jutted out of the ground. She lay there a moment, dazed. Then she sat up, and bent down to look at this thing that had tripped her. Probably a tree trunk. Then she must be near timberline. She bent closer. It was a rough wooden slab. Closer still. There were words carved on it. She lay flat and managed to make them out painfully. \n \n “Here lies Sarah Cannon. Lay to rest, and died alone, April 26, 1893.” \n \n Fanny had heard the story of Sarah Cannon, a stern spinster who had achieved the climb to the Peak, and who had met with mishap on the down trail. Her guide had left her to go for help. When the relief party returned, hours later, they had found her dead. \n \n Fanny sprang up, filled with a furious energy. She felt strangely light and clear-headed. She ran on, stopped, ran again. Now she was making little short runs here and there. It was snowing furiously, vindictively. It seemed to her that she had been running for hours. It probably was minutes. Suddenly she sank down, got to her feet again, stumbled on perhaps a dozen paces, and sank down again. It was as though her knees had turned liquid. She lay there, with her eyes shut. \n \n “I\u0027m just resting,” she told herself. “In a minute I\u0027ll go on. In a minute. After I\u0027ve rested.” \n \n “Hallo-o-o-o!” from somewhere on the other side of the snow blanket. “Hallo-o-o-o!” Fanny sat up, helloing shrilly, hysterically. She got to her feet, staggeringly. And Clarence Heyl walked toward her. \n \n “You ought to be spanked for this,” he said. \n \n Fanny began to cry weakly. She felt no curiosity as to his being there. She wasn\u0027t at all sure that he actually was there, for that matter. At that thought she dug a frantic hand into his arm. He seemed to understand, for he said, “It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m real enough. Can you walk?” \n \n “Yes.” But she tried it and found she could not. She decided she was too tired to care. “I stumbled over a thing—a horrible thing—a gravestone. And I must have hurt my leg. I didn\u0027t know——” \n \n She leaned against him, a dead weight. “Tell you what,” said Heyl, cheerfully. “You wait here. I\u0027ll go on down to Timberline Cabin for help, and come back.” \n \n “You couldn\u0027t manage it—alone? If I tried? If I tried to walk?” \n \n “Oh, impossible.” His tone was brisk. “Now you sit right down here.” She sank down obediently. She felt a little sorry for herself, and glad, too, and queer, and not at all cold. She looked up at him dumbly. He was smiling. “All right?” \n \n She nodded. He turned abruptly. The snow hid him from sight at once. \n \n “Here lies Sarah Cannon. Lay to rest and died alone, April 26, 1893.” \n \n She sank down, and pillowed her head on her arms. She knew that this was the end. She was very drowsy, and not at all sad. Happy, if anything. \n \n “You didn\u0027t really think I\u0027d leave you, did you, Fan?” \n \n She opened her eyes. Heyl was there. He reached down, and lifted her lightly to her feet. “Timberline Cabin\u0027s not a hundred yards away. I just did it to try you.” \n \n She had spirit enough left to say, “Beast.” \n \n Then he swung her up, and carried her down the trail. He carried her, not in his arms, as they do it in books and in the movies. He could not have gone a hundred feet that way. He carried her over his shoulder, like a sack of meal, by one arm and one leg, I regret to say. Any boy scout knows that trick, and will tell you what I mean. It is the most effectual carrying method known, though unromantic. \n \n And so they came to Timberline Cabin, and Albert Edward Cobbins was in the doorway. Heyl put her down gently on the bench that ran alongside the table. The hospitable table that bore two smoking cups of tea. Fanny\u0027s lips were cracked, and the skin was peeled from her nose, and her hair was straggling and her eyes red-rimmed. She drank the tea in great gulps. And then she went into the tiny bunkroom, and tumbled into one of the shelf-bunks, and slept. \n \n When she awoke she sat up in terror, and bumped her head against the bunk above, and called, “Clancy!” \n \n “Yep!” from the next room. He came to the door. The acrid smell of their pipes was incense in her nostrils. “Rested?” \n \n “What time is it?” \n \n “Seven o\u0027clock. Dinner time. Ham and eggs.” \n \n She got up stiffly, and bathed her roughened face, and produced a powder pad (they carry them in the face of danger, death, and dissolution) and dusted it over her scaly nose. She did her hair—her vigorous, abundant hair that shone in the lamplight, pulled down her blouse, surveyed her torn shoes ruefully, donned the khaki skirt that Albert Edward had magically produced from somewhere to take the place of her breeches. She dusted her shoes with a bit of rag, regarded herself steadily in the wavering mirror, and went in. \n \n The two men were talking quietly. Albert Edward was moving deftly from stove to table. They both looked up as she came in, and she looked at Heyl. Their eyes held. \n \n Albert Edward was as sporting a gentleman as the late dear king whose name he bore. He went out to tend Heyl\u0027s horse, he said. It was little he knew of horses, and he rather feared them, as does a sailing man. But he went, nevertheless. \n \n Heyl still looked at Fanny, and Fanny at him. \n \n “It\u0027s absurd,” said Fanny. “It\u0027s the kind of thing that doesn\u0027t happen.” \n \n “It\u0027s simple enough, really,” he answered. “I saw Ella Monahan in Chicago, and she told me all she knew, and something of what she had guessed. I waited a few days and came back. I had to.” He smiled. “A pretty job you\u0027ve made of trying to be selfish.” \n \n At that she smiled, too, pitifully enough, for her lower lip trembled. She caught it between her teeth in a last sharp effort at self-control. “Don\u0027t!” she quavered. And then, in a panic, her two hands came up in a vain effort to hide the tears. She sank down on the rough bench by the table, and the proud head came down on her arms so that there was a little clatter and tinkle among the supper things spread on the table. Then quiet. \n \n Clarence Heyl stared. He stared, helplessly, as does a man who has never, in all his life, been called upon to comfort a woman in tears. Then instinct came to his rescue. He made her side of the table in two strides (your favorite film star couldn\u0027t have done it better), put his two hands on her shoulders and neatly shifted the bowed head from the cold, hard surface of the table top to the warm, rough, tobacco-scented comfort of his coat. It rested there quite naturally. Just as naturally Fanny\u0027s arm crept up, and about his neck. So they remained for a moment, until he bent so that his lips touched her hair. Her head came up at that, sharply, so that it bumped his chin. They both laughed, looking into each other\u0027s eyes, but at what they saw there they stopped laughing and were serious. \n \n “Dear,” said Heyl. “Dearest.” The lids drooped over Fanny\u0027s eyes. “Look at me,” said Heyl. So she tried to lift them again, bravely, and could not. At that he bent his head and kissed Fanny Brandeis in the way a woman wants to be kissed for the first time by the man she loves. It hurt her lips, that kiss, and her teeth, and the back of her neck, and it left her breathless, and set things whirling. When she opened her eyes (they shut them at such times) he kissed her again, very tenderly, this time, and lightly, and reassuringly. She returned that kiss, and, strangely enough, it was the one that stayed in her memory long, long after the other had faded. \n \n “Oh, Clancy, I\u0027ve made such a mess of it all. Such a miserable mess. The little girl in the red tam was worth ten of me. I don\u0027t see how you can—care for me.” \n \n “You\u0027re the most wonderful woman in the world,” said Heyl, “and the most beautiful and splendid.” \n \n He must have meant it, for he was looking down at her as he said it, and we know that the skin had been peeled off her nose by the mountain winds and sun, that her lips were cracked and her cheeks rough, and that she was red-eyed and worn-looking. And she must have believed him, for she brought his cheek down to hers with such a sigh of content, though she said, “But are we at all suited to each other?” \n \n “Probably not,” Heyl answered, briskly. “That\u0027s why we\u0027re going to be so terrifically happy. Some day I\u0027ll be passing the Singer building, and I\u0027ll glance up at it and think how pitiful it would look next to Long\u0027s Peak. And then I\u0027ll be off, probably, to these mountains.” \n \n “Or some day,” Fanny returned, “we\u0027ll be up here, and I\u0027ll remember, suddenly, how Fifth Avenue looks on a bright afternoon between four and five. And I\u0027ll be off, probably, to the Grand Central station.” \n \n And then began one of those beautiful and foolish conversations which all lovers have whose love has been a sure and steady growth. Thus: “When did you first begin to care,” etc. And, “That day we spent at the dunes, and you said so and so, did you mean this and that?” \n \n Albert Edward Cobbins announced his approach by terrific stampings and scufflings, ostensibly for the purpose of ridding his boots of snow. He entered looking casual, and very nipped. \n \n “You\u0027re here for the night,” he said. “A regular blizzard. The greatest piece of luck I\u0027ve had in a month.” He busied himself with the ham and eggs and the teapot. “Hungry?” \n \n “Not a bit,” said Fanny and Heyl, together. \n \n “H\u0027m,” said Albert Edward, and broke six eggs into the frying pan just the same. \n \n After supper they aided Albert Edward in the process of washing up. When everything was tidy he lighted his most malignant pipe and told them seafaring yarns not necessarily true. Then he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and fell asleep there by the fire, effacing himself as effectually as one of three people can in a single room. They talked; low-toned murmurings that they seemed to find exquisitely meaningful or witty, by turn. Fanny, rubbing a forefinger (his) along her weather-roughened nose, would say, “At least you\u0027ve seen me at my worst.” \n \n Or he, mock serious: “I think I ought to tell you that I\u0027m the kind of man who throws wet towels into the laundry hamper.” \n \n But there was no mirth in Fanny\u0027s voice when she said, “Dear, do you think Lasker will give me that job? You know he said, `When you want a job, come back.\u0027 Do you think he meant it?” \n \n “Lasker always means it.” \n \n “But,” fearfully, and shyly, too, “you don\u0027t think I may have lost my drawing hand and my seeing eye, do you? As punishment?” \n \n “I do not. I think you\u0027ve just found them, for keeps. There wasn\u0027t a woman cartoonist in the country—or man, either, for that matter—could touch you two years ago. In two more I\u0027ll be just Fanny Brandeis\u0027 husband, that\u0027s all.” \n \n They laughed together at that, so that Albert Edward Cobbins awoke with a start and tried to look as if he had not been asleep, and failing, smiled benignly and drowsily upon them. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2689/74038.html","bookId":1479,"book":{"id":1479,"title":"Fanny Herself","description":"简介： It has become the fashion among novelists to introduce their hero in knee pants, their heroine in pinafore and pigtails.
