{"id":35012,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER NINE","content":"“Mr. Fenger will see you now.” Mr. Fenger, general manager, had been a long time about it. This heel-cooling experience was new to Fanny Brandeis. It had always been her privilege to keep others waiting. Still, she felt no resentment as she sat in Michael Fenger\u0027s outer office. For as she sat there, waiting, she was getting a distinct impression of this unseen man whose voice she could just hear as he talked over the telephone in his inner office. It was characteristic of Michael Fenger that his personality reached out and touched you before you came into actual contact with the man. Fanny had heard of him long before she came to Haynes-Cooper. He was the genie of that glittering lamp. All through the gigantic plant (she had already met department heads, buyers, merchandise managers) one heard his name, and felt the impress of his mind: \\n\\n \\n\\n “You\u0027ll have to see Mr. Fenger about that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes,”—pointing to a new conveyor, perhaps,—“that has just been installed. It\u0027s a great help to us. Doubles our shipping-room efficiency. We used to use baskets, pulled by a rope. It\u0027s Mr. Fenger\u0027s idea.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. Fenger had made it a slogan in the Haynes-Cooper plant long before the German nation forced it into our everyday vocabulary. Michael Fenger was System. He could take a muddle of orders, a jungle of unfilled contracts, a horde of incompetent workers, and of them make a smooth-running and effective unit. Untangling snarls was his pastime. Esprit de corps was his shibboleth. Order and management his idols. And his war-cry was “Results!” \\n\\n \\n\\n It was eleven o\u0027clock when Fanny came into his outer office. The very atmosphere was vibrant with his personality. There hung about the place an air of repressed expectancy. The room was electrically charged with the high-voltage of the man in the inner office. His secretary was a spare, middle-aged, anxious-looking woman in snuff-brown and spectacles; his stenographer a blond young man, also spectacled and anxious; his office boy a stern youth in knickers, who bore no relation to the slangy, gum-chewing, redheaded office boy of the comic sections. \\n\\n \\n\\n The low-pitched, high-powered voice went on inside, talking over the long-distance telephone. Fenger was the kind of man who is always talking to New York when he is in Chicago, and to Chicago when he is in New York. Trains with the word Limited after them were invented for him and his type. A buzzer sounded. It galvanized the office boy into instant action. It brought the anxious-looking stenographer to the doorway, notebook in hand, ready. It sent the lean secretary out, and up to Fanny. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Temper,” said Fanny, to herself, “or horribly nervous and high-keyed. They jump like a set of puppets on a string.” \\n\\n \\n\\n It was then that the lean secretary had said, “Mr. Fenger will see you now.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny was aware of a pleasant little tingle of excitement. She entered the inner office. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was characteristic of Michael Fenger that he employed no cheap tricks. He was not writing as Fanny Brandeis came in. He was not telephoning. He was not doing anything but standing at his desk, waiting for Fanny Brandeis. As she came in he looked at her, through her, and she seemed to feel her mental processes laid open to him as a skilled surgeon cuts through skin and flesh and fat, to lay bare the muscles and nerves and vital organs beneath. He put out his hand. Fanny extended hers. They met in a silent grip. It was like a meeting between two men. Even as he indexed her, Fanny\u0027s alert mind was busy docketing, numbering, cataloguing him. They had in common a certain force, a driving power. Fanny seated herself opposite him, in obedience to a gesture. He crossed his legs comfortably and sat back in his big desk chair. A great-bodied man, with powerful square shoulders, a long head, a rugged crest of a nose—the kind you see on the type of Englishman who has the imagination and initiative to go to Canada, or Australia, or America. He wore spectacles, not the fashionable horn-rimmed sort, but the kind with gold ear pieces. They were becoming, and gave a certain humanness to a face that otherwise would have been too rugged, too strong. A man of forty-five, perhaps. \\n\\n \\n\\n He spoke first. “You\u0027re younger than I thought.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “So are you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Old inside.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “So am I.” \\n\\n \\n\\n He uncrossed his legs, leaned forward, folded his arms on the desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You\u0027ve been through the plant, Miss Brandeis?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes. Twice. Once with a regular tourist party. And once with the special guide.” “Good. Go through the plant whenever you can. Don\u0027t stick to your own department. It narrows one.” He paused a moment. “Did you think that this opportunity to come to Haynes-Cooper, as assistant to the infants\u0027 wear department buyer was just a piece of luck, augmented by a little pulling on your part?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It wasn\u0027t. You were carefully picked by me, and I don\u0027t expect to find I\u0027ve made a mistake. I suppose you know very little about buying and selling infants\u0027 wear?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Less than about almost any other article in the world—at least, in the department store, or mail order world.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I thought so. And it doesn\u0027t matter. I pretty well know your history, which means that I know your training. You\u0027re young; you\u0027re ambitious, you\u0027re experienced; you\u0027re imaginative. There\u0027s no length you can\u0027t go, with these. It just depends on how farsighted your mental vision is. Now listen, Miss Brandeis: I\u0027m not going to talk to you in millions. The guides do enough of that. But you know we do buy and sell in terms of millions, don\u0027t you? Well, our infants\u0027 wear department isn\u0027t helping to roll up the millions; and it ought to, because there are millions of babies born every year, and the golden-spoon kind are in the minority. I\u0027ve decided that that department needs a woman, your kind of woman. Now, as a rule, I never employ a woman when I can use a man. There\u0027s only one other woman filling a really important position in the merchandise end of this business. That\u0027s Ella Monahan, head of the glove department, and she\u0027s a genius. She is a woman who is limited in every other respect—just average; but she knows glove materials in a way that\u0027s uncanny. I\u0027d rather have a man in her place; but I don\u0027t happen to know any men glove-geniuses. Tell me, what do you think of that etching?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny tried—and successfully—not to show the jolt her mind had received as she turned to look at the picture to which his finger pointed. She got up and strolled over to it, and she was glad her suit fitted and hung as it did in the back. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don\u0027t like it particularly. I like it less than any other etching you have here.” The walls were hung with them. “Of course you understand I know nothing about them. But it\u0027s too flowery, isn\u0027t it, to be good? Too many lines. Like a writer who spoils his effect by using too many words.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger came over and stood beside her, staring at the black and white and gray thing in its frame. “I felt that way, too.” He stared down at her, then. “Jew?” he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n A breathless instant. “No,” said Fanny Brandeis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Michael Fenger smiled for the first time. Fanny Brandeis would have given everything she had, everything she hoped to be, to be able to take back that monosyllable. She was gripped with horror at what she had done. She had spoken almost mechanically. And yet that monosyllable must have been the fruit of all these months of inward struggle and thought. “Now I begin to understand you,” Fenger went on. “You\u0027ve decided to lop off all the excrescences, eh? Well, I can\u0027t say that I blame you. A woman in business is handicapped enough by the very fact of her sex.” He stared at her again. “Too bad you\u0027re so pretty.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027m not!” said Fanny hotly, like a school-girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That\u0027s a thing that can\u0027t be argued, child. Beauty\u0027s subjective, you know.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don\u0027t see what difference it makes, anyway.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, yes, you do.” He stopped. “Or perhaps you don\u0027t, after all. I forget how young you are. Well, now, Miss Brandeis, you and your woman\u0027s mind, and your masculine business experience and sense are to be turned loose on our infants\u0027 wear department. The buyer, Mr. Slosson, is going to resent you. Naturally. I don\u0027t know whether we\u0027ll get results from you in a month, or six months or a year. Or ever. But something tells me we\u0027re going to get them. You\u0027ve lived in a small town most of your life. And we want that small-town viewpoint. D\u0027you think you\u0027ve got it?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny was on her own ground here. “If knowing the Wisconsin small-town woman, and the Wisconsin farmer woman—and man too, for that matter—means knowing the Oregon, and Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, and Iowa people of the same class, then I\u0027ve got it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Good!” Michael Fenger stood up. “I\u0027m not going to load you down with instructions, or advice. I think I\u0027ll let you grope your own way around, and bump your head a few times. Then you\u0027ll learn where the low places are. And, Miss Brandeis, remember that suggestions are welcome in this plant. We take suggestions all the way from the elevator starter to the president.” His tone was kindly, but not hopeful. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny was standing too, her mental eye on the door. But now she turned to face him squarely. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you mean that?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Absolutely.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, then, I\u0027ve one to make. Your stock boys and stock girls walk miles and miles every day, on every floor of this fifteen-story building. I watched them yesterday, filling up the bins, carrying orders, covering those enormous distances from one bin to another, up one aisle and down the next, to the office, back again. Your floors are concrete, or cement, or some such mixture, aren\u0027t they? I just happened to think of the boy who used to deliver our paper on Norris Street, in Winnebago, Wisconsin. He covered his route on roller skates. It saved him an hour. Why don\u0027t you put roller skates on your stock boys and girls?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger stared at her. You could almost hear that mind of his working, like a thing on ball bearings. “Roller skates.” It wasn\u0027t an exclamation. It was a decision. He pressed a buzzer—the snuff-brown secretary buzzer. “Tell Clancy I want him. Now.” He had not glanced up, or taken his eyes from Fanny. She was aware of feeling a little uncomfortable, but elated, too. She moved toward the door. Fenger stood at his desk. “Wait a minute.” Fanny waited. Still Fenger did not speak. Finally, “I suppose you know you\u0027ve earned six months\u0027 salary in the last five minutes.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny eyed him coolly. “Considering the number of your stock force, the time, energy, and labor saved, including wear and tear on department heads and their assistants, I should say that was a conservative statement.” And she nodded pleasantly, and left him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two days later every stock clerk in the vast plant was equipped with light-weight roller skates. They made a sort of carnival of it at first. There were some spills, too, going around corners, and a little too much hilarity. That wore off in a week. In two weeks their roller skates were part of them; just shop labor-savers. The report presented to Fenger was this: Time and energy saved, fifty-five per cent; stock staff decreased by one third. The picturesqueness of it, the almost ludicrous simplicity of the idea appealed to the entire plant. It tickled the humor sense in every one of the ten thousand employees in that vast organization. In the first week of her association with Haynes-Cooper Fanny Brandeis was actually more widely known than men who had worked there for years. The president, Nathan Haynes himself, sent for her, chuckling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nathan Haynes—but then, why stop for him? Nathan Haynes had been swallowed, long ago, by this monster plant that he himself had innocently created. You must have visited it, this Gargantuan thing that sprawls its length in the very center of Chicago, the giant son of a surprised father. It is one of the city\u0027s show places, like the stockyards, the Art Institute, and Field\u0027s. Fifteen years before, a building had been erected to accommodate a prosperous mail order business. It had been built large and roomy, with plenty of seams, planned amply, it was thought, to allow the boy to grow. It would do for twenty-five years, surely. In ten years Haynes-Cooper was bursting its seams. In twelve it was shamelessly naked, its arms and legs sticking out of its inadequate garments. New red brick buildings another—another. Five stories added to this one, six stories to that, a new fifteen story merchandise building. \\n\\n \\n\\n The firm began to talk in tens of millions. Its stock became gilt-edged, unattainable. Lucky ones who had bought of it diffidently, discreetly, with modest visions of four and a half per cent in their unimaginative minds, saw their dividends doubling, trebling, quadrupling, finally soaring gymnastically beyond all reason. Listen to the old guide who (at fifteen a week) takes groups of awed visitors through the great plant. How he juggles figures; how grandly they roll off his tongue. How glib he is with Nathan Haynes\u0027s millions. \\n\\n \\n\\n “This, ladies and gentlemen, is our mail department. From two thousand to twenty-five hundred pounds of mail, comprising over one hundred thousand letters, are received here every day. Yes, madam, I said every day. About half of these letters are orders. Last year the banking department counted one hundred and thirty millions of dollars. One hundred and thirty millions!” He stands there in his ill-fitting coat, and his star, and rubs one bony hand over the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Dear me!” says a lady tourist from Idaho, rather inadequately. And yet, not so inadequately. What exclamation is there, please, that fits a sum like one hundred and thirty millions of anything? \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny Brandeis, fresh from Winnebago, Wisconsin, slipped into the great scheme of things at the Haynes-Cooper plant like part of a perfectly planned blue print. It was as though she had been thought out and shaped for this particular corner. And the reason for it was, primarily, Winnebago, Wisconsin. For Haynes-Cooper grew and thrived on just such towns, with their surrounding farms and villages. Haynes-Cooper had their fingers on the pulse and heart of the country as did no other industry. They were close, close. When rugs began to take the place of ingrain carpets it was Haynes-Cooper who first sensed the change. Oh, they had had them in New York years before, certainly. But after all, it isn\u0027t New York\u0027s artistic progress that shows the development of this nation. It is the thing they are thinking, and doing, and learning in Backwash, Nebraska, that marks time for these United States. There may be a certain significance in the announcement that New York has dropped the Russian craze and has gone in for that quaint Chinese stuff. My dear, it makes the loveliest hangings and decorations. When Fifth Avenue takes down its filet lace and eyelet embroidered curtains, and substitutes severe shantung and chaste net, there is little in the act to revolutionize industry, or stir the art-world. But when the Haynes-Cooper company, by referring to its inventory ledgers, learns that it is selling more Alma Gluck than Harry Lauder records; when its statistics show that Tchaikowsky is going better than Irving Berlin, something epochal is happening in the musical progress of a nation. And when the orders from Noose Gulch, Nevada, are for those plain dimity curtains instead of the cheap and gaudy Nottingham atrocities, there is conveyed to the mind a fact of immense, of overwhelming significance. The country has taken a step toward civilization and good taste. \\n\\n \\n\\n So. You have a skeleton sketch of Haynes-Cooper, whose feelers reach the remotest dugout in the Yukon, the most isolated cabin in the Rockies, the loneliest ranch-house in Wyoming; the Montana mining shack, the bleak Maine farm, the plantation in Virginia. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the man who had so innocently put life into this monster? A plumpish, kindly-faced man; a bewildered, gentle, unimaginative and somewhat frightened man, fresh-cheeked, eye-glassed. In his suite of offices in the new Administration Building—built two years ago—marble and oak throughout—twelve stories, and we\u0027re adding three already; offices all two-toned rugs, and leather upholstery, with dim, rich, brown-toned Dutch masterpieces on the walls, he sat helpless and defenseless while the torrent of millions rushed, and swirled, and foamed about him. I think he had fancied, fifteen years ago, that he would some day be a fairly prosperous man; not rich, as riches are counted nowadays, but with a comfortable number of tens of thousands tucked away. Two or three hundred thousand; perhaps five hundred thousand!—perhaps a—but, nonsense! Nonsense! \\n\\n \\n\\n And then the thing had started. It was as when a man idly throws a pebble into a chasm, or shoves a bit of ice with the toe of his boot, and starts a snow-slide that grows as it goes. He had started this avalanche of money, and now it rushed on of its own momentum, plunging, rolling, leaping, crashing, and as it swept on it gathered rocks, trees, stones, houses, everything that lay in its way. It was beyond the power of human hand to stop this tumbling, roaring slide. In the midst of it sat Nathan Haynes, deafened, stunned, terrified at the immensity of what he had done. \\n\\n \\n\\n He began giving away huge sums, incredible sums. It piled up faster than he could give it away. And so he sat there in the office hung with the dim old masterpieces, and tried to keep simple, tried to keep sane, with that austerity that only mad wealth can afford—or bitter poverty. He caused the land about the plant to be laid out in sunken gardens and baseball fields and tennis courts, so that one approached this monster of commerce through enchanted grounds, glowing with tulips and heady hyacinths in spring, with roses in June, blazing with salvia and golden-glow and asters in autumn. There was something apologetic about these grounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n This, then, was the environment that Fanny Brandeis had chosen. On the face of things you would have said she had chosen well. The inspiration of the roller skates had not been merely a lucky flash. That idea had been part of the consistent whole. Her mind was her mother\u0027s mind raised to the nth power, and enhanced by the genius she was trying to crush. Refusing to die, it found expression in a hundred brilliant plans, of which the roller skate idea was only one. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny had reached Chicago on Sunday. She had entered the city as a queen enters her domain, authoritatively, with no fear upon her, no trepidation, no doubts. She had gone at once to the Mendota Hotel, on Michigan Avenue, up-town, away from the roar of the loop. It was a residential hotel, very quiet, decidedly luxurious. She had no idea of making it her home. But she would stay there until she could find an apartment that was small, bright, near the lake, and yet within fairly reasonable transportation facilities for her work. Her room was on the ninth floor, not on the Michigan Avenue side, but east, overlooking the lake. She spent hours at the windows, fascinated by the stone and steel city that lay just below with the incredible blue of the sail-dotted lake beyond, and at night, with the lights spangling the velvety blackness, the flaring blaze of Thirty-first Street\u0027s chop-suey restaurants and moving picture houses at the right; and far, far away, the red and white eye of the lighthouse winking, blinking, winking, blinking, the rumble and clank of a flat-wheeled Indiana avenue car, the sound of high laughter and a snatch of song that came faintly up to her from the speeding car of some midnight joy-riders! \\n\\n \\n\\n But all this had to do with her other side. It had no bearing on Haynes-Cooper, and business. Business! That was it. She had trained herself for it, like an athlete. Eight hours of sleep. A cold plunge on arising. Sane food. Long walks. There was something terrible about her earnestness. \\n\\n \\n\\n On Monday she presented herself at the Haynes-Cooper plant. Monday and Tuesday were spent in going over the great works. It was an exhausting process, but fascinating beyond belief. It was on Wednesday that she had been summoned for the talk with Michael Fenger. Thursday morning she was at her desk at eight-thirty. It was an obscure desk, in a dingy corner of the infants\u0027 wear department, the black sheep section of the great plant. Her very presence in that corner seemed to change it magically. You must remember how young she was, how healthy, how vigorous, with the freshness of the small town still upon her. It was health and youth, and vigor that gave that gloss to her hair (conscientious brushing too, perhaps), that color to her cheeks and lips, that brightness to her eyes. But crafty art and her dramatic instinct were responsible for the tailored severity of her costume, for the whiteness of her blouse, the trim common-sense expensiveness of her shoes and hat and gloves. \\n\\n \\n\\n Slosson, buyer and head of the department, came in at nine. Fanny rose to greet him. She felt a little sorry for Slosson. In her mind she already knew him for a doomed man. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, well!”—he was the kind of person who would say, well, well!—“You\u0027re bright and early, Miss—ah—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Brandeis.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, certainly; Miss Brandeis. Well, nothing like making a good start.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I wanted to go through the department by myself,” said Fanny. “The shelves and bins, and the numbering system. I see that your new maternity dresses have just come in.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, yes. How do you like them?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I think they\u0027re unnecessarily hideous, Mr. Slosson.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “My dear young lady, a plain garment is what they want. Unnoticeable.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Unnoticeable, yes; but becoming. At such a time a woman is at her worst. If she can get it, she at least wants a dress that doesn\u0027t add to her unattractiveness.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Let me see—you are not—ah—married, I believe, Miss Brandeis?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am. Three children. All girls.” He passed a nervous hand over his head, rumpling his hair a little. “An expensive proposition, let me tell you, three girls. But there\u0027s very little I don\u0027t know about babies, as you may imagine.” \\n\\n \\n\\n But there settled over Fanny Brandeis\u0027 face the mask of hardness that was so often to transform it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The morning mail was in—the day\u0027s biggest grist, deluge of it, a flood. Buyer and assistant buyer never saw the actual letters, or attended to their enclosed orders. It was only the unusual letter, the complaint or protest that reached their desk. Hundreds of hands downstairs sorted, stamped, indexed, filed, after the letter-opening machines had slit the envelopes. Those letter-openers! Fanny had hung over them, enthralled. The unopened envelopes were fed into them. Flip! Zip! Flip! Out! Opened! Faster than eye could follow. It was uncanny. It was, somehow, humorous, like the clever antics of a trained dog. You could not believe that this little machine actually performed what your eyes beheld. Two years later they installed the sand-paper letter-opener, marvel of simplicity. It made the old machine seem cumbersome and slow. Guided by Izzy, the expert, its rough tongue was capable of licking open six hundred and fifty letters a minute. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ten minutes after the mail came in the orders were being filled; bins, shelves, warehouses, were emptying their contents. Up and down the aisles went the stock clerks; into the conveyors went the bundles, down the great spiral bundle chute, into the shipping room, out by mail, by express, by freight. This leghorn hat for a Nebraska country belle; a tombstone for a rancher\u0027s wife; a plow, brave in its red paint; coffee, tea, tinned fruit, bound for Alaska; lace, muslin, sheeting, toweling, all intended for the coarse trousseau of a Georgia bride. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not remarkable that Fanny Brandeis fitted into this scheme of things. For years she had ministered to the wants of just this type of person. The letters she saw at Haynes-Cooper\u0027s read exactly as customers had worded their wants at Brandeis\u0027 Bazaar. The magnitude of the thing thrilled her, the endless possibilities of her own position. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the first two months of her work there she was as unaggressive as possible. She opened the very pores of her mind and absorbed every detail of her department. But she said little, followed Slosson\u0027s instructions in her position as assistant buyer, and suggested no changes. Slosson\u0027s wrinkle of anxiety smoothed itself away, and his manner became patronizingly authoritative again. Fanny seemed to have become part of the routine of the place. Fenger did not send for her. June and July were insufferably hot. Fanny seemed to thrive, to expand like a flower in the heat, when others wilted and shriveled. The spring catalogue was to be made up in October, as always, six months in advance. The first week in August Fanny asked for an interview with Fenger. Slosson was to be there. At ten o\u0027clock she entered Fenger\u0027s inner office. He was telephoning—something about dinner at the union League Club. His voice was suave, his tone well modulated, his accent correct, his English faultless. And yet Fanny Brandeis, studying the etchings on his wall, her back turned to him, smiled to herself. The voice, the tone, the accent, the English, did not ring true They were acquired graces, exquisite imitations of the real thing. Fanny Brandeis knew. She was playing the same game herself. She understood this man now, after two months in the Haynes-Cooper plant. These marvelous examples of the etcher\u0027s art, for example. They were the struggle for expression of a man whose youth had been bare of such things. His love for them was much the same as that which impels the new made millionaire to buy rare pictures, rich hangings, tapestries, rugs, not so much in the desire to impress the world with his wealth as to satisfy the craving for beauty, the longing to possess that which is exquisite, and fine, and almost unobtainable. You have seen how a woman, long denied luxuries, feeds her starved senses on soft silken things, on laces and gleaming jewels, for pure sensuous delight in their feel and look. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus Fanny mused as she eyed these treasures—grim, deft, repressed things, done with that economy of line which is the test of the etcher\u0027s art. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger hung up the receiver. \\n\\n \\n\\n “So it\u0027s taken you two months, Miss Brandeis. I was awfully afraid, from the start you made, that you\u0027d be back here in a week, bursting with ideas.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny smiled, appreciatively. He had come very near the truth. “I had to use all my self-control, that first week. After that it wasn\u0027t so hard.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger\u0027s eyes narrowed upon her. “Pretty sure of yourself, aren\u0027t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes,” said Fanny. She came over to his desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I wish we needn\u0027t have Mr. Slosson here this morning. After all, he\u0027s been here for years, and I\u0027m practically an upstart. He\u0027s so much older, too. I—I hate to hurt him. I wish you\u0027d—” \\n\\n \\n\\n But Fenger shook his head. “Slosson\u0027s due now. And he has got to take his medicine. This is business, Miss Brandeis. You ought to know what that means. For that matter, it may be that you haven\u0027t hit upon an idea. In that case, Slosson would have the laugh, wouldn\u0027t he?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Slosson entered at that moment. And there was a chip on his shoulder. It was evident in the way he bristled, in the way he seated himself. His fingers drummed his knees. He was like a testy, hum-ha stage father dealing with a willful child. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger took out his watch. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now, Miss Brandeis.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny took a chair facing the two men, and crossed her trim blue serge knees, and folded her hands in her lap. A deep pink glowed in her cheeks. Her eyes were very bright. All the Molly Brandeis in her was at the surface, sparkling there. And she looked almost insultingly youthful. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You—you want me to talk?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We want you to talk. We have time for just three-quarters of an hour of uninterrupted conversation. If you\u0027ve got anything to say you ought to say it in that time. Now, Miss Brandeis, what\u0027s the trouble with the Haynes-Cooper infants\u0027 wear department?” \\n\\n \\n\\n And Fanny Brandeis took a long breath \\n\\n \\n\\n “The trouble with the Haynes-Cooper infants\u0027 wear department is that it doesn\u0027t understand women. There are millions of babies born every year. An incredible number of them are mail order babies. I mean by that they are born to tired, clumsy-fingered immigrant women, to women in mills and factories, to women on farms, to women in remote villages. They\u0027re the type who use the mail order method. I\u0027ve learned this one thing about that sort of woman: she may not want that baby, but either before or after it\u0027s born she\u0027ll starve, and save, and go without proper clothing, and even beg, and steal to give it clothes—clothes with lace on them, with ribbon on them, sheer white things. I don\u0027t know why that\u0027s true, but it is. Well, we\u0027re not reaching them. Our goods are unattractive. They\u0027re packed and shipped unattractively. Why, all this department needs is a little psychology—and some lace that doesn\u0027t look as if it had been chopped out with an ax. It\u0027s the little, silly, intimate things that will reach these women. No, not silly, either. Quite understandable. She wants fine things for her baby, just as the silver-spoon mother does. The thing we\u0027ll have to do is to give her silver-spoon models at pewter prices.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It can\u0027t be done,” said Slosson. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now, wait a minute, Slosson,” Fenger put in, smoothly. “Miss Brandeis has given us a very fair general statement. We\u0027ll have some facts. Are you prepared to give us an actual working plan?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes. At least, it sounds practical to me. And if it does to you—and to Mr. Slosson—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Humph!” snorted that gentleman, in expression of defiance, unbelief, and a determination not to be impressed. \\n\\n \\n\\n It acted as a goad to Fanny. She leaned forward in her chair and talked straight at the big, potent force that sat regarding her in silent attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I still say that we can copy the high-priced models in low-priced materials because, in almost every case, it isn\u0027t the material that makes the expensive model; it\u0027s the line, the cut, the little trick that gives it style. We can get that. We\u0027ve been giving them stuff that might have been made by prison labor, for all the distinction it had. Then I think we ought to make a feature of the sanitary methods used in our infants\u0027 department. Every article intended for a baby\u0027s use should be wrapped or boxed as it lies in the bin or on the shelf. And those bins ought to be glassed. We would advertise that, and it would advertise itself. Our visitors would talk about it. This department hasn\u0027t been getting a square deal in the catalogue. Not enough space. It ought to have not only more catalogue space, but a catalogue all its own—the Baby Book. Full of pictures. Good ones. Illustrations that will make every mother think her baby will look like that baby, once it is wearing our No. 29E798—chubby babies, curly-headed, and dimply. And the feature of that catalogue ought to be, not separate garments, but complete outfits. Outfits boxed, ready for shipping, and ranging in price all the way from twenty-five dollars to three-ninety-eight—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It can\u0027t be done!” yelled Slosson. “Three-ninety-eight! Outfits!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It can be done. I\u0027ve figured it out, down to a packet of assorted size safety pins. We\u0027ll call it our emergency outfit. Thirty pieces. And while we\u0027re about it, every outfit over five dollars ought to be packed in a pink or a pale blue pasteboard box. The outfits trimmed in pink, pink boxes; the outfits trimmed in blue, blue boxes. In eight cases out of ten their letters will tell us whether it\u0027s a pink or blue baby. And when they get our package, and take out that pink or blue box, they\u0027ll be as pleased as if we\u0027d made them a present. It\u0027s the personal note—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Personal slop!” growled Slosson. “It isn\u0027t business. It\u0027s sentimental slush!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Sentimental, yes,” agreed Fanny pleasantly, “but then, we\u0027re running the only sentimental department in this business. And we ought to be doing it at the rate of a million and a quarter a year. If you think these last suggestions sentimental, I\u0027m afraid the next one—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Let\u0027s have it, Miss Brandeis,” Fenger encouraged her quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It\u0027s”—she flashed a mischievous smile at Slosson—“it\u0027s a mother\u0027s guide and helper, and adviser. A woman who\u0027ll answer questions, give advice. Some one they\u0027ll write to, with a picture in their minds of a large, comfortable, motherly-looking person in gray. You know we get hundreds of letters asking whether they ought to order flannel bands, or the double-knitted kind. That sort of thing. And who\u0027s been answering them? Some sixteen-year-old girl in the mailing department who doesn\u0027t know a flannel band from a bootee when she sees it. We could call our woman something pleasant and everydayish, like Emily Brand. Easy to remember. And until we can find her, I\u0027ll answer those letters myself. They\u0027re important to us as well as to the woman who writes them. And now, there\u0027s the matter of obstetrical outfits. Three grades, packed ready for shipment, practical, simple, and complete. Our drug section has the separate articles, but we ought to—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, lord!” groaned Slosson, and slumped disgustedly in his seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Fenger got up, came over to Fanny, and put a hand on her shoulder for a moment. He looked down at her. “I knew you\u0027d do it.” He smiled queerly. “Tell me, where did you learn all this?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don\u0027t know,” faltered Fanny happily. “Brandeis\u0027 Bazaar, perhaps. It\u0027s just another case of plush photograph album.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Plush—?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny told him that story. Even the discomfited Slosson grinned at it. \\n\\n \\n\\n But after ten minutes more of general discussion Slosson left. Fenger, without putting it in words, had conveyed that to him. Fanny stayed. They did things that way at Haynes-Cooper. No waste. No delay. That she had accomplished in two months that which ordinarily takes years was not surprising. They did things that way, too, at Haynes-Cooper. Take the case of Nathan Haynes himself. And Michael Fenger too who, not so many years before, had been a machine-boy in a Racine woolen mill. \\n\\n \\n\\n For my part, I confess that Fanny Brandeis begins to lose interest for me. Big Business seems to dwarf the finer things in her. That red-cheeked, shabby little schoolgirl, absorbed in Zola and peanut brittle in the Winnebago library, was infinitely more appealing than this glib and capable young woman. The spitting wildcat of the street fight so long ago was gentler by far than this cool person who was so deliberately taking his job away from Slosson. You, too, feel that way about her? That is as it should be. It is the penalty they pay who, given genius, sympathy, and understanding as their birthright, trade them for the tawdry trinkets money brings. \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps the last five minutes of that conference between Fanny and Michael Fenger reveals a new side, and presents something of interest. It was a harrowing and unexpected five minutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n You may remember how Michael Fenger had a way of looking at one, silently. It was an intent and concentrated gaze that had the effect of an actual physical hold. Most people squirmed under it. Fanny, feeling it on her now, frowned and rose to leave. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Shall you want to talk these things over again? Of course I\u0027ve only outlined them, roughly. You gave me so little time.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger, at his desk, did not answer, or turn away his gaze. A little blaze of wrath flamed into Fanny\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n “General manager or not,” she said, very low-voiced, “I wish you wouldn\u0027t sit and glower at me like that. It\u0027s rude, and it\u0027s disconcerting,” which was putting it forthrightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I beg your pardon!” Fenger came swiftly around the desk, and over to her. “I was thinking very hard. Miss Brandeis, will you dine with me somewhere tonight? Then to-morrow night? But I want to talk to you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Here I am. Talk.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But I want to talk to—you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n It was then that Fanny Brandeis saved an ugly situation. For she laughed, a big, wholesome, outdoors sort of laugh. She was honestly amused. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My dear Mr. Fenger, you\u0027ve been reading the murky magazines. Very bad for you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger was unsmiling: “Why won\u0027t you dine with me?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Because it would be unconventional and foolish. I respect the conventions. They\u0027re so sensible. And because it would be unfair to you, and to Mrs. Fenger, and to me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Rot! It\u0027s you who have the murky magazine viewpoint, as you call it, when you imply—” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Now, look here, Mr. Fenger,” Fanny interrupted, quietly. “Let\u0027s be square with each other, even if we\u0027re not being square with ourselves. You\u0027re the real power in this plant, because you\u0027ve the brains. You can make any person in this organization, or break them. That sounds melodramatic, but it\u0027s true. I\u0027ve got a definite life plan, and it\u0027s as complete and detailed as an engineering blue print. I don\u0027t intend to let you spoil it. I\u0027ve made a real start here. If you want to, I\u0027ve no doubt you can end it. But before you do, I want to warn you that I\u0027ll make a pretty stiff fight for it. I\u0027m no silent sufferer. I\u0027ll say things. And people usually believe me when I talk.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Still the silent, concentrated gaze. With a little impatient exclamation Fanny walked toward the door. Fenger, startlingly light and agile for his great height, followed. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027m sorry, Miss Brandeis, terribly sorry. You see, you interest me very much. Very much.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thanks,” dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Don\u0027t go just yet. Please. I\u0027m not a villain. Really. That is, not a deliberate villain. But when I find something very fine, very intricate, very fascinating and complex—like those etchings, for example—I am intrigued. I want it near me. I want to study it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny said nothing. But she thought, “This is a dangerously clever man. Too clever for you. You know so little about them.” Fenger waited. Most women would have found refuge in words. The wrong words. It is only the strong who can be silent when in doubt. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Perhaps you will dine with Mrs. Fenger and me at our home some evening? Mrs. Fenger will speak to you about it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m usually too tired for further effort at the end of the day. I\u0027m sorry——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Some Sunday night perhaps, then. Tea.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thank you.” And so out, past the spare secretary, the anxious-browed stenographer, the academic office boy, to the hallway, the elevator, and finally the refuge of her own orderly desk. Slosson was at lunch in one of the huge restaurants provided for employees in the building across the street. She sat there, very still, for some minutes; for more minutes than she knew. Her hands were clasped tightly on the desk, and her eyes stared ahead in a puzzled, resentful, bewildered way. Something inside her was saying over and over again: \\n\\n \\n\\n “You lied to him on that very first day. That placed you. That stamped you. Now he thinks you\u0027re rotten all the way through. You lied on the very first day.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Ella Monahan poked her head in at the door. The Gloves were on that floor, at the far end. The two women rarely saw each other, except at lunch time. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Missed you at lunch,” said Ella Monahan. She was a pink-cheeked, bright-eyed woman of forty-one or two, prematurely gray and therefore excessively young in her manner, as women often are who have grown gray before their time. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny stood up, hurriedly. “I was just about to go.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Try the grape pie, dear. It\u0027s delicious.” And strolled off down the aisle that seemed to stretch endlessly ahead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny stood for a moment looking after her, as though meaning to call her back. But she must have changed her mind, because she said, “Oh, nonsense!” aloud. And went across to lunch. And ordered grape pie. And enjoyed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2689/74028.html","bookId":1479,"book":{"id":1479,"title":"Fanny Herself","description":"简介： It has become the fashion among novelists to introduce their hero in knee pants, their heroine in pinafore and pigtails.
