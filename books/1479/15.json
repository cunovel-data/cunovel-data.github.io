{"id":35017,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN","content":"Fanny Brandeis\u0027 blouses showed real Cluny now, and her hats were nothing but line. A scant two years before she had wondered if she would ever reach a pinnacle of success lofty enough to enable her to wear blue tailor suits as smart as the well-cut garments worn by her mother\u0027s friend, Mrs. Emma McChesney. Mrs. McChesney\u0027s trig little suits had cost fifty dollars, and had looked sixty. Fanny\u0027s now cost one hundred and twenty-five, and looked one hundred and twenty-five. Her sleeves alone gave it away. If you would test the soul of a tailor you have only to glance at shoulder-seam, elbow and wrist. Therein lies the wizardry. Fanny\u0027s sleeve flowed from arm-pit to thumb-bone without a ripple. Also she moved from the South side to the North side, always a sign of prosperity or social ambition, in Chicago. Her new apartment was near the lake, exhilaratingly high, correspondingly expensive. And she was hideously lonely. She was earning a man-size salary now, and she was working like a man. A less magnificently healthy woman could not have stood the strain, for Fanny Brandeis was working with her head, not her heart. When we say heart we have come to mean something more than the hollow muscular structure that propels the blood through the veins. That, in the dictionary, is the primary definition. The secondary definition has to do with such words as emotion, sympathy, tenderness, courage, conviction. She was working, now, as Michael Fenger worked, relentlessly, coldly, indomitably, using all the material at hand as a means to an end, with never a thought of the material itself, as a builder reaches for a brick, or stone, and fits it into place, smoothly, almost without actually seeing the brick itself, except as something which will help to make a finished wall. She rarely prowled the city now. She told herself she was too tired at night, and on Sundays and holidays, and I suppose she was. Indeed, she no longer saw things with her former vision. It was as though her soul had shriveled in direct proportion to her salary\u0027s expansion. The streets seldom furnished her with a rich mental meal now. When she met a woman with a child, in the park, her keen eye noted the child\u0027s dress before it saw the child itself, if, indeed, she noticed the child at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fascinating Facts, the guileless, pink-cheeked youth who had driven her home the night of her first visit to the Fengers, shortly after her coming to Haynes-Cooper\u0027s, had proved her faithful slave, and she had not abused his devotion. Indeed, she hardly considered it that. The sex side of her was being repressed with the artist side. Most men found her curt, brisk, businesslike manner a little repellent, though interesting. They never made love to her, in spite of her undeniable attractiveness. Fascinating Facts drove her about in his smart little roadster and one night he established himself in her memory forever as the first man who had ever asked her to marry him. He did it haltingly, painfully, almost grudgingly. Fanny was frankly amazed. She had enjoyed going about with him. He rested and soothed her. He, in turn, had been stimulated by her energy, her humor, her electric force. Nothing was said for a minute after his awkward declaration. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But,” he persisted, “you like me, don\u0027t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course I do. Immensely.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then why?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “When a woman of my sort marries it\u0027s a miracle. I\u0027m twenty-six, and intelligent and very successful. A frightful combination. Unmarried women of my type aren\u0027t content just to feel. They must analyze their feelings. And analysis is death to romance.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Great Scott! You expect to marry somebody sometime, don\u0027t you, Fanny?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No one I know now. When I do marry, if I do, it will be with the idea of making a definite gain. I don\u0027t mean necessarily worldly gain, though that would be a factor, too.” Fascinating Facts had been staring straight ahead, his hands gripping the wheel with unnecessary rigidity. He relaxed a little now, and even laughed, though not very successfully. Then he said something very wise, for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Listen to me, girl. You\u0027ll never get away with that vampire stuff. Talons are things you have to be born with. You\u0027ll never learn to grab with these.” He reached over, and picked up her left hand lying inertly in her lap, and brought it up to his lips, and kissed it, glove and all. “They\u0027re built on the open-face pattern—for giving. You can\u0027t fool me. I know.” \\n\\n \\n\\n A year and a half after her coming to Haynes-Cooper Fanny\u0027s department was doing a business of a million a year. The need had been there. She had merely given it the impetus. She was working more or less directly with Fenger now, with an eye on every one of the departments that had to do with women\u0027s clothing, from shoes to hats. Not that she did any actual buying, or selling in these departments. She still confined her actual selecting of goods to the infants\u0027 wear section, but she occupied, unofficially, the position of assistant to the General Merchandise Manager. They worked well together, she and Fenger, their minds often marching along without the necessity of a single spoken word. There was no doubt that Fenger\u0027s mind was a marvelous piece of mechanism. Under it the Haynes-Cooper plant functioned with the clockwork regularity of a gigantic automaton. System and Results—these were his twin gods. With his mind intent on them he failed to see that new gods, born of spiritual unrest, were being set up in the temples of Big Business. Their coming had been rumored for many years. Words such as Brotherhood, Labor, Rights, Humanity, Hours, once regarded as the special property of the street corner ranter, were creeping into our everyday vocabulary. And strangely enough, Nathan Haynes, the gentle, the bewildered, the uninspired, heard them, and listened. Nathan Haynes had begun to accustom himself to the roar of the flood that had formerly deafened him. He was no longer stunned by the inrush of his millions. The report sheet handed him daily had never ceased to be a wildly unexpected thing, and he still shrank from it, sometimes. It was so fantastic, so out of all reason. But he even dared, now and then, to put out a tentative hand to guide the flood. He began to realize, vaguely, that Italian Gardens, and marble pools, educational endowments and pet charities were but poor, ineffectual barriers of mud and sticks, soon swept away by the torrent. As he sat there in his great, luxurious office, with the dim, rich old portraits gleaming down on him from the walls, he began, gropingly, to evolve a new plan; a plan by which the golden flood was to be curbed, divided, and made to form a sub-stream, to be utilized for the good of the many; for the good of the Ten Thousand, who were almost Fifteen Thousand now, with another fifteen thousand in mills and factories at distant points, whose entire output was swallowed up by the Haynes-Cooper plant. Michael Fenger, Super-Manager, listened to the plan, smiled tolerantly, and went on perfecting an already miraculous System. Sarah Sapinsky, at seven a week, was just so much untrained labor material, easily replaced by material exactly like it. No, Michael Fenger, with his head in the sand, heard no talk of new gods. He only knew that the monster plant under his management was yielding the greatest possible profit under the least possible outlay. \\n\\n \\n\\n In Fanny Brandeis he had found a stimulating, energizing fellow worker. That had been from the beginning. In the first month or two of her work, when her keen brain was darting here and there, into forgotten and neglected corners, ferreting out dusty scraps of business waste and holding them up to the light, disdainfully, Fenger had watched her with a mingling of amusement and a sort of fond pride, as one would a precocious child. As the months went on the pride and amusement welded into something more than admiration, such as one expert feels for a fellow-craftsman. Long before the end of the first year he knew that here was a woman such as he had dreamed of all his life and never hoped to find. He often found himself sitting at his office desk, or in his library at home, staring straight ahead for a longer time than he dared admit, his papers or book forgotten in his hand. His thoughts applied to her adjectives which proved her a paradox: Generous, sympathetic, warm-hearted, impulsive, imaginative; cold, indomitable, brilliant, daring, intuitive. He would rouse himself almost angrily and force himself to concentrate again upon the page before him. I don\u0027t know how he thought it all would end—he whose life-habit it was to follow out every process to its ultimate step, whether mental or mechanical. As for Fanny, there was nothing of the intriguant about her. She was used to admiration. She was accustomed to deference from men. Brandeis\u0027 Bazaar had insured that. All her life men had taken orders from her, all the way from Aloysius and the blithe traveling men of whom she bought goods, to the salesmen and importers in the Chicago wholesale houses. If they had attempted, occasionally, to mingle the social and personal with the commercial Fanny had not resented their attitude. She had accepted their admiration and refused their invitations with equal good nature, and thus retained their friendship. It is not exaggeration to say that she looked upon Michael Fenger much as she had upon these genial fellow-workers. A woman as straightforward and direct as she has what is known as a single-track mind in such matters. It is your soft and silken mollusc type of woman whose mind pursues a slimy and labyrinthine trail. But it is useless to say that she did not feel something of the intense personal attraction of the man. Often it used to puzzle and annoy her to find that as they sat arguing in the brisk, everyday atmosphere of office or merchandise room the air between them would suddenly become electric, vibrant. They met each other\u0027s eyes with effort. When their hands touched, accidentally, over papers or samples they snatched them back. Fanny found herself laughing uncertainly, at nothing, and was furious. When a silence fell between them they would pounce upon it, breathlessly, and smother it with talk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Do not think that any furtive love-making went on, sandwiched between shop talk. Their conversation might have taken place between two men. Indeed, they often were brutally frank to each other. Fanny had the vision, Fenger the science to apply it. Sometimes her intuition leaped ahead of his reasoning. Then he would say, “I\u0027m not sold on that,” which is modern business slang meaning, “You haven\u0027t convinced me.” She would go back and start afresh, covering the ground more slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Usually her suggestions were practical and what might be termed human. They seemed to be founded on an uncanny knowledge of people\u0027s frailties. It was only when she touched upon his beloved System that he was adamant. \\n\\n \\n\\n “None of that socialistic stuff,” he would say. “This isn\u0027t a Benevolent Association we\u0027re running. It\u0027s the biggest mail order business in the world, and its back-bone is System. I\u0027ve been just fifteen years perfecting that System. It\u0027s my job. Hands off.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “A fifteen year old system ought to be scrapped,” Fanny would retort, boldly. “Anyway, the Simon Legree thing has gone out.” \\n\\n \\n\\n No one in the plant had ever dared to talk to him like that. He would glare down at Fanny for a moment, like a mastiff on a terrier. Fanny, seeing his face rage-red, would flash him a cheerful and impudent smile. The anger, fading slowly, gave way to another look, so that admiration and resentment mingled for a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Lucky for you you\u0027re not a man.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I wish I were.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Not a very thrilling conversation for those of you who are seeking heartthrobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n In May Fanny made her first trip to Europe for the firm. It was a sudden plan. Instantly Theodore leaped to her mind and she was startled at the tumult she felt at the thought of seeing him and his child. The baby, a girl, was more than a year old. Her business, a matter of two weeks, perhaps, was all in Berlin and Paris, but she cabled Theodore that she would come to them in Munich, if only for a day or two. She had very little curiosity about the woman Theodore had married. The memory of that first photograph of hers, befrizzed, bejeweled, and asmirk, had never effaced itself. It had stamped her indelibly in Fanny\u0027s mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n The day before she left for New York (she sailed from there) she had a letter from Theodore. It was evident at once that he had not received her cable. He was in Russia, giving a series of concerts. Olga and the baby were with him. He would be back in Munich in June. There was some talk of America. When Fanny realized that she was not to see him she experienced a strange feeling that was a mixture of regret and relief. All the family love in her, a racial trait, had been stirred at the thought of again seeing that dear blond brother, the self-centered, willful, gifted boy who had held the little congregation rapt, there in the Jewish house of worship in Winnebago. But she had recoiled a little from the meeting with this other unknown person who gave concerts in Russia, who had adopted Munich as his home, who was the husband of this Olga person, and the father of a ridiculously German looking baby in a very German looking dress, all lace and tucks, and wearing bracelets on its chubby arms, and a locket round its neck. That was what one might expect of Olga\u0027s baby. But not of Theodore\u0027s. Besides, what business had that boy with a baby, anyway? Himself a baby. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fenger had arranged for her cabin, and she rather resented its luxury until she learned later, that it is the buyers who always occupy the staterooms de luxe on ocean liners. She learned, too, that the men in yachting caps and white flannels, and the women in the smartest and most subdued of blue serge and furs were not millionaires temporarily deprived of their own private seagoing craft, but buyers like herself, shrewd, aggressive, wise and incredibly endowed with savoir faire. Merely to watch one of them dealing with a deck steward was to know for all time the superiority of mind over matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Most incongruously, it was Ella Monahan and Clarence Heyl who waved good-by to her as her ship swung clear of the dock. Ella was in New York on her monthly trip. Heyl had appeared at the hotel as Fanny was adjusting her veil and casting a last rather wild look around the room. Molly Brandeis had been the kind of woman who never misses a train or overlooks a hairpin. Fanny\u0027s early training had proved invaluable more than once in the last two years. Nevertheless, she was rather flustered, for her, as the elevator took her down to the main floor. She told herself it was not the contemplation of the voyage itself that thrilled her. It was the fact that here was another step definitely marking her progress. Heyl, looking incredibly limp, was leaning against a gaudy marble pillar, his eyes on the downcoming elevators. Fanny saw him just an instant before he saw her, and in that moment she found herself wondering why this boy (she felt years older than he) should look so fantastically out of place in this great, glittering, feverish hotel lobby. Just a shy, rather swarthy Jewish boy, who wore the right kind of clothes in the wrong manner—then Heyl saw her and came swiftly toward her. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hello, Fan!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hello, Clancy!” They had not seen each other in six months. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Anybody else going down with you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No. Ella Monahan had a last-minute business appointment, but she promised to be at the dock, somehow, before the boat leaves. I\u0027m going to be grand, and taxi all the way.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027ve an open car, waiting.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But I won\u0027t have it! I can\u0027t let you do that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, yes you can. Don\u0027t take it so hard. That\u0027s the trouble with you business women. You\u0027re killing the gallantry of a nation. Some day one of you will get up and give me a seat in a subway——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027ll punish you for that, Clancy. If you want the Jane Austen thing I\u0027ll accommodate. I\u0027ll drop my handkerchief, gloves, bag, flowers and fur scarf at intervals of five minutes all the way downtown. Then you may scramble around on the floor of the cab and feel like a knight.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny had long ago ceased to try to define the charm of this man. She always meant to be serenely dignified with him. She always ended by feeling very young, and, somehow, gloriously carefree and lighthearted. There was about him a naturalness, a simplicity, to which one responded in kind. \\n\\n \\n\\n Seated beside her he turned and regarded her with disconcerting scrutiny. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Like it?” demanded Fanny, pertly. And smoothed her veil, consciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n “No.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, for a man who looks negligee even in evening clothes aren\u0027t you overcritical?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I\u0027m not criticizing your clothes. Even I can see that that hat and suit have the repressed note that means money. And you\u0027re the kind of woman who looks her best in those plain dark things.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, then?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You look like a buyer. In two more years your face will have that hard finish that never comes off.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am a buyer.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You\u0027re not. You\u0027re a creator. Remember, I\u0027m not belittling your job. It\u0027s a wonderful job—for Ella Monahan. I wish I had the gift of eloquence. I wish I had the right to spank you. I wish I could prove to you, somehow, that with your gift, and heritage, and racial right it\u0027s as criminal for you to be earning your thousands at Haynes-Cooper\u0027s as it would have been for a vestal virgin to desert her altar fire to stoke a furnace. Your eyes are bright and hard, instead of tolerant. Your mouth is losing its graciousness. Your whole face is beginning to be stamped with a look that says shrewdness and experience, and success.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I am successful. Why shouldn\u0027t I look it?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Because you\u0027re a failure. I\u0027m sick, I tell you—sick with disappointment in you. Jane Addams would have been a success in business, too. She was born with a humanity sense, and a value sense, and a something else that can\u0027t be acquired. Ida Tarbell could have managed your whole Haynes-Cooper plant, if she\u0027d had to. So could a dozen other women I could name. You don\u0027t see any sign of what you call success on Jane Addams\u0027s face, do you? You wouldn\u0027t say, on seeing her, that here was a woman who looked as if she might afford hundred-dollar tailor suits and a town car. No. All you see in her face is the reflection of the souls of all the men and women she has worked to save. She has covered her job—the job that the Lord intended her to cover. And to me she is the most radiantly beautiful woman I have ever seen.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Fanny sat silent. She was twisting the fingers of one hand in the grip of the other, as she had since childhood, when deeply disturbed. And suddenly she began to cry—silently, harrowingly, as a man cries, her shoulders shaking, her face buried in her furs. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Fanny! Fanny girl!” He was horribly disturbed and contrite. He patted her arm, awkwardly. She shook free of his hand, childishly. “Don\u0027t cry, dear. I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s just that I care so much. It\u0027s just——” \\n\\n \\n\\n She raised an angry, tear-stained face. “It\u0027s just that you have an exalted idea of your own perceptions. It\u0027s just that you\u0027ve grown up from what they used to call a bright little boy to a bright young man, and you\u0027re just as tiresome now as you were then. I\u0027m happy enough, except when I see you. I\u0027m getting the things I starved for all those years. Why, I\u0027ll never get over being thrilled at the idea of being able to go to the theater, or to a concert, whenever I like. Actually whenever I want to. And to be able to buy a jabot, or a smart hat, or a book. You don\u0027t know how I wanted things, and how tired I got of never having them. I\u0027m happy! I\u0027m happy! Leave me alone!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It\u0027s an awful price to pay for a hat, and a jabot, and a book and a theater ticket, Fan.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Ella Monahan had taken the tube, and was standing in the great shed, watching arrivals with interest, long before they bumped over the cobblestones of Hoboken. The three descended to Fanny\u0027s cabin. Ella had sent champagne—six cosy pints in a wicker basket. \\n\\n \\n\\n “They say it\u0027s good for seasickness,” she announced, cheerfully, “but it\u0027s a lie. Nothing\u0027s good for seasickness, except death, or dry land. But even if you do feel miserable—and you probably will—there\u0027s something about being able to lie in your berth and drink champagne alone, by the spoonful, that\u0027s sort of soothing.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Heyl had fallen silent. Fanny was radiant again, and exclamatory over her books and flowers. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course it\u0027s my first trip,” she explained, “and an event in my life, but I didn\u0027t suppose that anybody else would care. What\u0027s this? Candy? Glace fruit.” She glanced around the luxurious little cabin, then up at Heyl, impudently. “I may be a coarse commercial person, Clancy, but I must say I like this very, very much. Sorry.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They went up on deck. Ella, a seasoned traveler, was full of parting instructions. “And be sure to eat at Kempinski\u0027s, in Berlin. Twenty cents for lobster. And caviar! Big as hen\u0027s eggs, and as cheap as codfish. And don\u0027t forget to order mai-bowle. It tastes like champagne, but isn\u0027t, and it has the most delicious dwarf strawberries floating on top. This is just the season for it. You\u0027re lucky. If you tip the waiter one mark he\u0027s yours for life. Oh, and remember the plum compote. You\u0027ll be disappointed in their Wertheim\u0027s that they\u0027re always bragging about. After all, Field\u0027s makes \u0027em all look like country stores.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Wertheim\u0027s? Is that something to eat, too?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, idiot. It\u0027s their big department store.” Ella turned to Heyl, for whom she felt mingled awe and liking. “If this trip of hers is successful, the firm will probably send her over three or four times a year. It\u0027s a wonderful chance for a kid like her.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then I hope,” said Heyl, quietly, “that this trip may be a failure.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Ella smiled, uncertainly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Don\u0027t laugh,” said Fanny, sharply. “He means it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Ella, sensing an unpleasant something in which she had no part, covered the situation with another rush of conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You\u0027ll get the jolt of your life when you come to Paris and find that you\u0027re expected to pay for the lunches, and all the cab fares, and everything, of those shrimpy little commissionaires. Polite little fellows, they are, in frock coats, and mustaches, and they just stand aside, as courtly as you please, while you pay for everything. Their house expects it. I almost passed away, the first time, but you get used to it. Say, imagine one of our traveling men letting you pay for his lunch and taxi.” \\n\\n \\n\\n She rattled on, genially. Heyl listened with unfeigned delight. Ella found herself suddenly abashed before those clear, far-seeing eyes. “You think I\u0027m a gabby old girl, don\u0027t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I think you\u0027re a wonderful woman,” said Heyl. “Very wise, and very kind.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why—thanks,” faltered Ella. “Why—thanks.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They said their good-bys. Ella hugged Fanny warm-heartedly. Then she turned away, awkwardly. Heyl put his two hands on Fanny\u0027s shoulders and looked down at her. For a breathless second she thought he was about to kiss her. She was amazed to find herself hoping that he would. But he didn\u0027t. “Good-by,” he said, simply. And took her hand in his steel grip a moment, and dropped it. And turned away. A messenger boy, very much out of breath, came running up to her, a telegram in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n “For me?” Fanny opened it, frowned, smiled. “It\u0027s from Mr. Fenger. Good wishes. As if all those flowers weren\u0027t enough.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mm,” said Ella. She and Heyl descended the gang-way, and stood at the dock\u0027s edge, looking rather foolish and uncertain, as people do at such times. There followed a few moments of scramble, of absurdly shouted last messages, of bells, and frantic waving of handkerchiefs. Fanny, at the rail, found her two among the crowd, and smiled down upon them, mistily. Ella was waving energetically. Heyl was standing quite still, looking up. The ship swung clear, crept away from the dock. The good-bys swelled to a roar. Fanny leaned far over the rail and waved too, a sob in her throat. Then she saw that she was waving with the hand that held the yellow telegram. She crumpled it in the other hand, and substituted her handkerchief. Heyl still stood, hat in hand, motionless. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why don\u0027t you wave good-by?” she called, though he could not possibly hear. “Wave good-by!” And then the hand with the handkerchief went to her face, and she was weeping. I think it was that old drama-thrill in her, dormant for so long. But at that Heyl swung his hat above his head, three times, like a schoolboy, and, grasping Ella\u0027s plump and resisting arm, marched abruptly away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2689/74033.html","bookId":1479,"book":{"id":1479,"title":"Fanny Herself","description":"简介： It has become the fashion among novelists to introduce their hero in knee pants, their heroine in pinafore and pigtails.
