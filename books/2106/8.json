{"id":91455,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"On the same morning that Dove\u0027s party left on the road to Maldobar, Drizzt set out on a journey of his own. The initial horror of his gruesome discovery the previous night had not diminished, and the drow feared that it never would, but another emotion had also entered Drizzt\u0027s thinking. He could do nothing for the innocent farmers and their children, nothing except avenge their deaths. That thought was not so pleasing to Drizzt; he had left the Underdark behind, and the savagery as well, he had hoped. With the images of the carnage still so horribly clear in his mind, and all alone as he was, Drizzt could look only to his scimitar for justice.\\n\\n Drizzt took two precautions before he set out on the murderer\u0027s trail. First, he crept back down to the farmyard, to the back of the house, where the farmers had placed a broken plowshare. The metal blade was heavy, but the determined drow hoisted it and carried it away without a thought to the discomfort.\\n\\n Drizzt then called Guenhwyvar. As soon as the panther arrived and took note of Drizzt\u0027s scowl, it dropped into an alert crouch. Guenhwyvar had been around Drizzt long enough to recognize that expression and to believe that they would see battle before it returned to its astral home.\\n\\n They moved off before dawn, Guenhwyvar easily following the barghest\u0027s clear trail, as Ulgulu had hoped. Their pace was slow, with Drizzt hindered by the plowshare, but steady, and as soon as Drizzt caught the sound of a distant buzzing noise, he knew he had done right in collecting the cumbersome item.\\n\\n Still, the remainder of the morning passed without incident. The trail led the companions into a rocky ravine and to the base of a high, uneven cliff. Drizzt feared that he might have to scale the cliff face - and leave the plowshare behind - but soon he spotted a single narrow trail winding up along the wall. The ascending path remained smooth as it wound around sheer bends in the cliff face, blind and dangerous turns. Wanting to use the terrain to his advantage, Drizzt sent Guenhwyvar far ahead and moved along by himself, dragging the plowshare and feeling vulnerable on the open cliff.\\n\\n That feeling did nothing to quench the simmering fires in Drizzt\u0027s lavender eyes, though, which burned clearly from under the low-pulled cowl of his oversized gnoll cloak. If the sight of the ravine looming just to the side unnerved the drow, he needed only to remember the farmers. A short while later, when Drizzt heard the expected buzzing noise from somewhere lower on the narrow trail, he only smiled.\\n\\n The buzz quickly closed from behind. Drizzt fell back against the cliff wall and snapped out his scimitar, carefully monitoring the time it took the sprite to close.\\n\\n Tephanis flashed beside the drow, the quickling\u0027s little dagger darting and prodding for an opening in the defensive twists of the waving scimitar. The sprite was gone in an instant, moving up ahead of Drizzt, but Tephanis had scored a hit, nicking Drizzt on one shoulder.\\n\\n Drizzt inspected the wound and nodded gravely, accepting it as a minor inconvenience. He knew he could not defeat the blinding attack, and he knew, too, that allowing this first strike had been necessary for his ultimate victory. A growl on the path up ahead put Drizzt quickly back on alert. Guenhwyvar had met the sprite, and the panther, with flashing paws that could match the quickling\u0027s speed, no doubt had turned the thing back around.\\n\\n Again Drizzt put his back to the wall, monitoring the buzzing approach. Just as the sprite came around the corner, Drizzt jumped out onto the narrow path, his scimitar at the ready. The drow\u0027s other hand was less conspicuous and held steady a metal object, ready to tilt it out to block the opening.\\n\\n The speeding sprite cut back in toward the wall, easily able, as Drizzt realized, to avoid the scimitar. But in his narrow focus on his target, the sprite failed to notice Drizzt\u0027s other hand.\\n\\n Drizzt hardly registered the sprite\u0027s movements, but the sudden \"Bong!\" and the sharp vibrations in his hand as the creature smacked into the plowshare brought a satisfied grin to his lips. He let the plowshare drop and scooped up the unconscious sprite by the throat, holding it clear of the ground. Guenhwyvar bounded around the bend about the same time the sprite shook the dizziness from his sharp-featured head, his long and pointed ears nearly flopping right over the other side of his head with each movement.\\n\\n \"What creature are you?\" Drizzt asked in the goblin tongue, the language that had worked for him with the gnoll band. To his surprise, he found that the sprite understood, though his high-pitched, blurred response came too quickly for Drizzt to even begin to understand.\\n\\n He gave the sprite a quick jerk to silence him, then growled, \"One word at a time! What is your name?\"\\n\\n \"Tephanis,\" the sprite said indignantly. Tephanis could move his legs a hundred times a second, but they didn\u0027t do him much good while he was suspended in the air. The sprite glanced down to the narrow ledge and saw his small dagger lying next to the dented plowshare.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s scimitar moved in dangerously. \"Did you kill the farmers?\" he asked bluntly. He almost struck in response to the sprite\u0027s ensuing chuckle.\\n\\n \"No,\" Tephanis said quickly.\\n\\n \"Who did?\"\\n\\n \"Ulgulu!\" the sprite proclaimed. Tephanis pointed up the path and blurted out a stream of excited words. Drizzt managed to make out a few, \"Ulgulu... waiting... dinner,\" being the most disturbing of them.\\n\\n Drizzt really didn\u0027t know what he would do with the captured sprite. Tephanis was simply too fast for Drizzt to safely handle. He looked to Guenhwyvar, sitting casually a few feet up the path, but the panther only yawned and stretched.\\n\\n Drizzt was about to come back with another question, to try to figure out where Tephanis fit into the whole scenario, but the cocky sprite decided that he had suffered enough of the encounter. His hands moving too fast for Drizzt to react, Tephanis reached down into his boot, produced another knife, and slashed at Drizzt\u0027s already injured wrist.\\n\\n This time, the cocky sprite had underestimated his opponent. Drizzt could not match the sprite\u0027s speed, could not even follow the tiny, darting dagger. As painful as the wounds were, though, Drizzt was too filled with rage to take note. He only tightened his grip on the sprite\u0027s collar and thrust his scimitar ahead. Even with such limited mobility, Tephanis was quick enough and nimble enough to dodge, laughing wildly all the while.\\n\\n The sprite struck back, digging a deeper cut into Drizzt\u0027s forearm. Finally Drizzt chose a tactic that Tephanis could not counter, one that took the sprite\u0027s advantage away. He slammed Tephanis into the wall, then tossed the stunned creature off the cliff.\\n\\n Some time later, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar crouched in the brush at the base of a steep, rocky slope. At the top, behind carefully placed bushes and branches, lay a cave, and, every so often, goblin voices rolled out.\\n\\n Beside the cave, to the side of the sloping ground was a steep drop. Beyond the cave, the mountain climbed on at an even greater angle. The tracks, though they were sometimes scarce on the bare stone, had led Drizzt and Guenhwyvar to this spot; there could be no doubt that the monster who slaughtered the farmers was in the cave.\\n\\n Drizzt again fought with his decision to avenge the farmers\u0027 deaths. He would have preferred a more civilized justice, a lawful court, but what was he to do? He certainly could not go to the human villagers with his suspicions, nor to anyone else. Crouching in the bush, Drizzt thought again of the farmers, of the sandy-haired boy, of the pretty girl, barely a woman, and of the young man he had disarmed in the blueberry patch. Drizzt fought hard to keep his breathing steady. In the wild Underdark he had sometimes given in to his instinctive urges, a darker side of himself that fought with brutal and deadly efficiency, and Drizzt could feel that alter-ego welling within him once again. At first, he tried to sublimate the rage, but then he remembered the lessons he had learned. This darker side was a part of him, a tool for survival, and was not altogether evil.\\n\\n It was necessary.\\n\\n Drizzt understood his disadvantage in the situation, however. He had no idea how many enemies he would encounter, or even what type of monsters they might be. He heard goblins, but the carnage at the farmhouse indicated that something much more powerful was involved. Drizzt\u0027s good judgment told him to sit and watch, to learn more of his enemies.\\n\\n Another fleeting instant of remembrance, the scene at the farmhouse, threw that good judgment aside. Scimitar in one hand, the sprite\u0027s dagger in another, Drizzt stalked up the stony hill. He didn\u0027t slow when he neared the cave, but merely ripped the brush aside and walked straight in.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar hesitated and watched from behind, confused by the drow\u0027s straightforward tactics.\\n\\n Tephanis felt cool air brushing by his face and thought for a moment that he was enjoying some pleasant dream. The sprite came out of his delusion quickly, though, and realized that he was fast approaching the ground. Fortunately, Tephanis was not far from the cliff. He send his hands and feet spinning rapidly enough to produce a constant humming sound and clawed and kicked at the cliff in an effort to slow his descent. In the meantime, he began the incantations to a levitation spell, possibly the only thing that could save him.\\n\\n A few agonizingly slow seconds passed before the sprite felt his body buoyed by the spell. He still hit the ground hard, but he realized that his wounds were minor.\\n\\n Tephanis stood relatively slowly and dusted himself off. His first thought was to go and warn Ulgulu of the approaching drow, but he reconsidered at once. He could not levitate up to the cave complex in time to warn the barghest, and there was only one path up the cliff face - which the drow was on.\\n\\n Tephanis had no desire to face that one again.\\n\\n Ulgulu had not tried to cover his tracks at all. The dark elf had served the barghest\u0027s needs; now he planned to make a meal of Drizzt, one that might bring him into maturity and allow him to return to Gehenna.\\n\\n Ulgulu\u0027s two goblin guards were not too surprised at Drizzt\u0027s entrance. Ulgulu had told them to expect the drow and to simply delay him out in the entry room until the barghest could come and attend to him. The goblins halted their conversation abruptly, dropped their spears in a blocking cross over the curtain, and puffed out their scrawny chests, foolishly following their boss\u0027s instructions as Drizzt approached.\\n\\n \"None can go in - \" one of them began, but then, in a single swipe of Drizzt\u0027s scimitar, both the goblin and its companion staggered down, clutching at their opened throats. The spear barrier fell away and Drizzt never even slowed as he stalked through the curtain.\\n\\n In the middle of the inner room, the drow saw his enemy. Scarlet-skinned and giant-sized, the barghest waited with crossed arms and a wicked, confident grin.\\n\\n Drizzt threw the dagger and charged right in behind it. That throw saved the drow\u0027s life, for when the dagger passed harmlessly through his enemy\u0027s body, Drizzt recognized the trap. He came in anyway, unable to break his momentum, and his scimitar entered the image without finding anything tangible to cut into.\\n\\n The real barghest was behind the stone throne at the back of the room. Using another power of his considerable magical repertoire, Kempfana had sent an image of himself into the middle of the room to hold the drow in place.\\n\\n Immediately Drizzt\u0027s instincts told him that he had been set up. This was no real monster he faced but an apparition meant to keep him in the open and vulnerable. The room was sparsely furnished; nothing nearby offered any cover.\\n\\n Ulgulu, levitating above the drow, came down quickly, lighting softly behind him. The plan was perfect and the target was right in place.\\n\\n Drizzt, his reflexes and muscles trained and honed to fighting perfection, sensed the presence and dove forward into the image as Ulgulu launched a heavy blow. The barghest\u0027s huge hand only clipped Drizzt\u0027s flowing hair, but that alone nearly ripped the drow\u0027s head to the side.\\n\\n Drizzt half-turned his body as he dove, rolling back to his feet facing Ulgulu. He met a monster even larger than the giant image, but that fact did nothing to intimidate the enraged drow. Like a stretched cord, Drizzt snapped straight back at the barghest. By the time Ulgulu even recovered from his unexpected miss, Drizzt\u0027s lone scimitar had poked him three times in the belly and had dug a neat little hole under his chin.\\n\\n The barghest roared in rage but was not too badly hurt, for Drizzt\u0027s drow-made weapon had lost most of its magic in the drow\u0027s time on the surface and only magical weapons - such as Guenhwyvar\u0027s claws and teeth - could truly harm a creature from Gehenna\u0027s rifts.\\n\\n The huge panther slammed onto the back of Ulgulu\u0027s head with enough force to drop the barghest facedown on the floor. Never had Ulgulu felt such pain as Guenhwyvar\u0027s claws raked across his head.\\n\\n Drizzt moved to join in, when he heard a shuffle from the back of the room. Kempfana came charging out from behind the throne, bellowing in protest.\\n\\n It was Drizzt\u0027s turn to utilize some magic. He threw a globe of darkness in the scarlet-skinned barghest\u0027s path, then dove into it himself, crouching on his hands and knees. Unable to slow, Kempfana roared in, stumbled over the braced drow - kicking Drizzt with enough force to blast the air from his lungs - and fell heavily out the other side of the darkness.\\n\\n Kempfana shook his head to clear it and planted his huge hands to rise. Drizzt was on the barghest\u0027s back in no time, hacking away wildly with his vicious scimitar. Blood matted Kempfana\u0027s hair by the time he was able to brace himself enough to throw the drow off. He staggered to his feet dizzily and turned to face the drow.\\n\\n Across the room, Ulgulu crawled and tumbled, rolled and twisted. The panther was too quick and too sleek for the giant\u0027s lumbering counters. A dozen gashes scarred Ulgulu\u0027s face and now Guenhwyvar had its teeth clamped on the back of the giant\u0027s neck and all four paws raking at the giant\u0027s back.\\n\\n Ulgulu had another option, though. Bones crackled and reformed. Ulgulu\u0027s scarred face became an elongated snout filled with wicked canine teeth. Thick hair sprouted from all over the giant, fending off Guenhwyvar\u0027s claw attacks. Flailing arms became kicking paws.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar battled a gigantic wolf, and the panther\u0027s advantage was short-lived.\\n\\n Kempfana stalked in slowly, showing Drizzt new respect.\\n\\n \"You killed them all,\" Drizzt said in the goblin tongue, his voice so utterly cold that it stopped the scarlet-skinned barghest in his tracks.\\n\\n Kempfana was not a stupid creature. The barghest recognized the explosive rage in this drow and had felt the sharp bite of the scimitar. Kempfana knew better than to walk straight in, so again he called upon his otherworldly skills. In the blink of an orange-burning eye, the scarlet-skinned barghest was gone, stepping through an extradimensional door and reappearing right behind Drizzt.\\n\\n As soon as Kempfana disappeared, Drizzt instinctively broke to the side. The blow from behind came quicker, though, landing squarely on Drizzt\u0027s back and launching him across the room. Drizzt crashed into the base of one wall and came up into a kneel, gasping for his breath.\\n\\n Kempfana did stalk straight in this time; the drow had dropped his scimitar halfway to the wall, too far away for Drizzt to grasp.\\n\\n The great barghest-wolf, nearly twice Guenhwyvar\u0027s size, rolled over and straddled the panther. Great jaws snapped near Guenhwyvar\u0027s throat and face, the panther batting wildly to hold them at bay. Guenhwyvar could not hope to win an even fight against the wolf. The only advantage the panther retained was mobility. Like a black-shafted arrow, Guenhwyvar darted out from under the wolf and toward the curtain.\\n\\n Ulgulu howled and gave chase, ripping the curtain down and charging on, toward the waning daylight.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar came out of the cave as Ulgulu tore through the curtain, pivoted instantly, and leaped straight up to the slopes above the entrance. When the great wolf came out, the panther again crashed down on Ulgulu\u0027s back and resumed its raking and slashing.\\n\\n \"Ulgulu killed the farmers, not I,\" Kempfana growled as he approached. He kicked Drizzt\u0027s scimitar across to the other side of the room. \"Ulgulu wants you - you who killed his gnolls. But I shall kill you, drow warrior. I shall feast on your life force so that I may gain in strength!\"\\n\\n Drizzt, still trying to find his breath, hardly heard the words. The only thoughts that occurred to him were the images of the dead farmers, images that gave Drizzt courage. The barghest drew near and Drizzt snapped a vile gaze upon him, a determined gaze not lessened in the least by the drow\u0027s obviously desperate situation.\\n\\n Kempfana hesitated at the sight of those narrowed, burning eyes, and the barghest\u0027s delay brought Drizzt all the time he needed. He had fought giant monsters before, most notably hook horrors. Always Drizzt\u0027s scimitars had ended those battles, but for his initial strikes, he had, every time, used only his own body. The pain in his back was no match for his mounting rage. He rushed out from the wall, remaining in a crouch, and dove through Kempfana\u0027s legs, spinning and catching a hold behind the barghest\u0027s knee.\\n\\n Kempfana, unconcerned, lurched down to grab the squirming drow. Drizzt eluded the giant\u0027s grasp long enough to find some leverage. Still, Kempfana accepted the attacks as a mere inconvenience. When Drizzt put the barghest off balance, Kempfana willingly toppled, meaning to crush the wiry little elf. Again Drizzt was too quick for the barghest. He twisted out from under the falling giant, put his feet back under him, and sprinted for the opposite end of the chamber.\\n\\n \"No, you shall not!\" Kempfana bellowed, crawling then running in pursuit. Just as Drizzt scooped up his scimitar, giant arms wrapped around him and easily lifted him off the ground.\\n\\n \"Crush you and bite you!\" Kempfana roared, and indeed, Drizzt heard one of his ribs crack. He tried to wiggle around to face his foe, then gave up on the notion, concentrating instead on freeing his sword arm.\\n\\n Another rib snapped; Kempfana\u0027s huge arms tightened. The barghest did not want to simply kill the drow, though, realizing the great gains toward maturity he could make by devouring so powerful an enemy, by feeding on Drizzt\u0027s life force.\\n\\n \"Bite you, drow.\" The giant laughed. \"Feast!\"\\n\\n Drizzt grasped his scimitar in both hands with strength inspired by the images of the farmhouse. He tore the weapon loose and snapped it straight back over his head. The blade entered Kempfana\u0027s open, eager mouth and dove down the monster\u0027s throat.\\n\\n Drizzt twisted it and turned it.\\n\\n Kernpfana whipped about wildly and Drizzt\u0027s muscles and joints nearly ripped apart under the strain. The drow had found his focus, though, the scimitar hilt, and he continued to twist and turn.\\n\\n Kempfana went down heavily, gurgling, and rolled onto Drizzt, trying to squash the life out of him. Pain began to seep into Drizzt\u0027s consciousness.\\n\\n \"No!\" he cried, grabbing at the image of the sandy-haired boy, slain in his bed. Still Drizzt twisted and turned the blade. The gurgling continued, a wheezing sound of air rising through choking blood. Drizzt knew that this battle was won when the creature above him no longer moved.\\n\\n Drizzt wanted only to curl up and find his breath but told himself that he was not yet finished. He crawled out from under Kempfana, wiped the blood, his own blood, from his lips, unceremoniously ripped his scimitar free of Kempfana\u0027s mouth, and retrieved his dagger.\\n\\n He knew that his wounds were serious, could prove fatal if he didn\u0027t attend to them immediately. His breath continued to come in forced, bloodied gasps. It didn\u0027t concern him, though, for Ulgulu, the monster who had killed the farmers, still lived.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar sprang from the giant wolf\u0027s back, again finding a tenuous footing on the steep slope above the cave entrance. Ulgulu spun, snarling, and leaped up at the panther, clawing and raking at the stones in an effort to get higher.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar leaped out over the barghest-wolf, pivoted immediately, and slashed at Ulgulu\u0027s backside. The wolf spun but Guenhwyvar leaped by, again to the slope.\\n\\n The game of hit-and-run went on for several moments, Guenhwyvar striking, then darting away. Finally, though, the wolf anticipated the panther\u0027s dodge. Ulgulu brought the leaping panther down in his massive jaws. Guenhwyvar squirmed and tore free, but came up near the steep gorge. Ulgulu hovered over the cat, blocking any escape.\\n\\n Drizzt exited the cave as the great wolf bore down, pushing Guenhwyvar back. Pebbles rolled out into the gorge; the panther\u0027s back legs slipped and then clawed back, trying to find a hold. Even mighty Guenhwyvar could not hold out against the weight and strength of the barghest-wolf, Drizzt knew.\\n\\n Drizzt saw immediately that he could not get the great wolf off Guenhwyvar in time. He pulled out the onyx figurine and tossed it near the combatants. \"Be gone, Guenhwyvar!\" he commanded.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar normally would not desert its master in a time of such danger, but the panther understood what Drizzt had in mind. Ulgulu bore in powerfully, determinedly driving Guenhwyvar from the ledge.\\n\\n Then the beast was pushing only intangible vapors. Ulgulu lurched forward and scrambled wildly, kicking more stones and the onyx figurine into the gorge. Overbalanced, the wolf could not find a hold, and then Ulgulu was falling.\\n\\n Bones popped again, and the canine fur thinned; Ulgulu could not enact a levitation spell in his canine form. Desperate, the barghest concentrated, reaching for his goblinoid form. The wolf maw shortened into a flat-featured face; paws thickened and reformed into arms.\\n\\n The half-transformed creature didn\u0027t make it, but instead cracked into the stone.\\n\\n Drizzt stepped off the ledge and into a levitation spell, moving down slowly and close to the rocky wall. As it had before, the spell soon died away. Drizzt bounced and clawed through the last twenty feet of the fall, coming to a hard stop at the rocky bottom. He saw the barghest twitching only a few feet away and tried to rise in defense, but darkness overwhelmed him.\\n\\n Drizzt could not know how many hours had passed when a thunderous roar awakened him some time later. It was dark now and a cloudy night. Slowly the memories of the encounter came back to the dazed and injured drow. To his relief, he saw that Ulgulu lay still on the stone beside him, half a goblin and half a wolf, obviously quite dead.\\n\\n A second roar, back up by the cave, turned the drow toward the ledge high above him. There stood Lagerbottoms, the hill giant, returned from a hunting trip and outraged by the carnage he had found.\\n\\n Drizzt knew as soon as he managed to crawl to his feet that he could not fight another battle this day. He searched around for a moment, found the onyx figurine, and dropped it into his pouch. He wasn\u0027t too concerned for Guenhwyvar. He had seen the panther through worse calamities - caught in the explosion of a magical wand, pulled into the Plane of Earth by an enraged elemental, even dropped into a lake of hissing acid. The figurine appeared undamaged, and Drizzt was certain that Guenhwyvar was now comfortably at rest in its astral home.\\n\\n Drizzt, however, could afford no such rest. Already the giant had begun picking its way down the rocky slope. With a final look to Ulgulu, Drizzt felt a sense of vengeance that did little to defeat the agonizing, bitter memories of the slaughtered farmers. He set off, moving farther into the wild mountains, running from the giant and from the guilt. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-sojourn-the-dark-elf-trilogy-3/page-8.html","bookId":2106,"book":{"id":2106,"title":"The Dark Elf Trilogy: Sojourn (The Dark Elf Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: Far above the merciless Underdark, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden fights to survive the elements of Toril\u0027s harsh surface.
