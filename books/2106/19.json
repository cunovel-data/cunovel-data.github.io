{"id":91465,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Drizzt noticed that Montolio looked more than a little troubled after Hooter, back with more news, departed.\\n\\n \"The split of Graul\u0027s forces?\" he inquired.\\n\\n Montolio nodded, his expression grim. \"Worg-riding orcs - just a handful - circling around to the west.\"\\n\\n Drizzt looked out beyond the rock wall, to the pass secured by their brandy trough. \"We can stop them,\" he said.\\n\\n Still the ranger\u0027s expression told of doom. \"Another group of worgs - a score or more - is coming from the south.\" Drizzt did not miss the ranger\u0027s fear, as Montolio added, \"Caroak is leading them. I never thought that one would fall in with Graul.\"\\n\\n \"A giant?\" Drizzt asked.\\n\\n \"No, winter wolf,\" Montolio replied. At the words, Guenhwyvar flattened its ears and growled angrily.\\n\\n \"The panther knows,\" Montolio said as Drizzt looked on in amazement. \"A winter wolf is a perversion of nature, a blight against creatures following the natural order, and thus, Guenhwyvar\u0027s enemy.\"\\n\\n The black panther growled again.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a large creature,\" Montolio went on, \"and too smart for a wolf. I have fought Caroak before. Alone he could give us a time of it! With the worgs around him, and us busy fighting orcs, he might have his way.\"\\n\\n Guenhwyvar growled a third time and tore the ground with great claws.\\n\\n \"Guenhwyvar will deal with Caroak,\" Drizzt remarked.\\n\\n Montolio moved over and grabbed the panther by the ears, holding Guenhwyvar\u0027s gaze with his own sightless expression. \" \u0027Ware the wolf\u0027s breath,\" the ranger said. \"A cone of frost, it is, that will freeze your muscles to your bones. I have seen a giant felled by it!\" Montolio turned to Drizzt and knew that the drow wore a concerned expression.\\n\\n \"Guenhwyvar has to keep them away from us until we can chase off Graul and his group,\" the ranger said, \"then we can make arrangements for Caroak.\" He released his hold on the panther\u0027s ears and swatted Guenhwyvar hard on the scruff of the neck.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar roared a fourth time and darted off through the grove, a black arrow aimed at the heart of doom.\\n\\n Graul\u0027s main attack force came, as expected, from the west, whooping and hollering and trampling the brush in its path. The troops approached in two groups, one through each of the dense copses.\\n\\n \"Aim for the group on the south!\" Montolio called up to Drizzt, in position on the crossbow-laden rope bridge. \"We\u0027ve friends in the other!\"\\n\\n As if in confirmation of the ranger\u0027s decree, the northern copse erupted suddenly in orc cries that sounded more like terrified shrieks than battle calls. A chorus of throaty growls accompanied the screams. Bluster the bear had come to Montolio\u0027s call, Drizzt knew, and by the sounds in the copse, he had brought a number of friends.\\n\\n Drizzt wasn\u0027t about to question their good fortune. He positioned himself behind the closest crossbow and let the quarrel fly as the first orcs emerged from the southern copse. Right down the line the drow ran, clicking off his shots in rapid succession. From down below, Montolio arced a few arrows over the wall.\\n\\n In the sudden swarm of orcs, Drizzt couldn\u0027t tell how many of their shots actually hit, but the buzzing bolts did slow the orc charge and scattered their ranks. Several orcs dropped to their bellies; a few turned and headed straight back into the trees. The bulk of the group, though, and some running to join from the other copse, came on.\\n\\n Montolio fired one last time, then felt his way back into a sheltered run behind the center of his bent tree traps, where he would be protected on three sides by walls of wood and trees. His bow in one hand, he checked his sword and then reached around to touch a rope at his other side.\\n\\n Drizzt noticed the ranger moving into position twenty feet below him and to the side, and he figured that this might be his last free opportunity. He sorted out an object hanging above Montolio\u0027s head and dropped a spell over it.\\n\\n The quarrels had brought minimum chaos to the field of charging orcs, but the traps proved more effective. First one, then another, orc stepped in, their cries rising over the din of the charge. As other orcs saw their companions\u0027 pain and peril, they slowed considerably or stopped altogether.\\n\\n With the commotion growing in the field, Drizzt paused and carefully considered his final shot. He noticed a large, finely outfitted orc watching from the closest boughs of the northern copse. Drizzt knew this was Graul, but his attention shifted immediately to the figure standing next to the orc king. \"Damn,\" the drow muttered, recognizing McGristle. Now he was torn, and he moved the crossbow back and forth between the adversaries. Drizzt wanted to shoot at Roddy, wanted to end his personal torment then and there. But Roddy was not an orc, and Drizzt found himself repulsed by the thought of killing a human!\\n\\n \"Graul is the more important target,\" the drow told himself, more to distract his inner torment than for any other reason. Quickly, before he could find any more arguments, he took aim and fired. The quarrel whistled long and far, knocking into the trunk of a tree just inches above Graul\u0027s head. Roddy promptly grabbed the orc king and pulled him back into the deeper shadows. In their stead came a roaring stone giant, rock in hand.\\n\\n The boulder clipped the trees beside Drizzt, shaking the branches and bridge alike. A second shot followed at once, this one taking a supporting post squarely and dropping the front half of the bridge.\\n\\n Drizzt had seen it coming, though he was amazed and horrified by the uncanny accuracy at so far a range. As the front half of the bridge fell away beneath him, Drizzt leaped out, catching a hold in a tangle of branches. When he finally sorted himself out, he was faced by a new problem. From the east came the worg-riders, brandishing torches.\\n\\n Drizzt looked to the log trap, then to the crossbow. It and the post securing it had survived the boulder hit, but the drow could not hope to cross to it on the faltering bridge.\\n\\n The leaders of the main host, now behind Drizzt, reached the rock wall then. Fortunately, the first orc leaping over landed squarely into another of the wicked jaw traps, and its companions were not so quick to follow.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar leaped around and between the many broken crags of stone marking the descent to the north. The panther caught the distant first cries of battle back at the grove, but more intently, Guenhwyvar heard the ensuing howls of the approaching wolf pack. The panther sprang up to a low ledge and waited.\\n\\n Caroak, the huge silver canine beast, led the charge. Focused on the distant grove, the winter wolf\u0027s surprise was complete when Guenhwyvar dropped upon it, scratching and raking wildly.\\n\\n Clumps of silver fur flew about under the assault. Yelping, Caroak dove into a sidelong roll. Guenhwyvar rode the wolf as a lumberjack might foot-roll a log in a pool, slashing and kicking with each step. But Caroak was a wizened old wolf, a veteran of a hundred battles. As the monster rolled about to its back, a blast of icy frost came at the panther.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar dodged aside, both from the frost and the onslaught of several worgs. The frost got the panther on the side of the face, though, numbing Guenhwyvar\u0027s jaw. Then the chase was on, with Guenhwyvar leaping and tumbling right around the wolf pack, and the worgs, and angry Caroak, nipping at the panther\u0027s heels.\\n\\n Time was running out for Drizzt and Montolio. Above all else, the drow knew that he must protect their rear flank. In synchronous movements, Drizzt kicked off his boots, took the flint in one hand and put a piece of steel in his mouth, and leaped up to a branch that would take him out over the lone crossbow.\\n\\n He got above it a moment later. Holding with one hand, he struck the flint hard. Sparks rolled down, close to the mark. Drizzt struck again and again, and finally, a spark hit the oil-soaked rags tipping the loaded quarrel squarely enough to ignite them.\\n\\n Now the drow was not so lucky. He rocked and twisted but could not get his foot close enough to the trigger.\\n\\n Montolio could see nothing, of course, but he knew well enough the general situation. He heard the approaching worgs at the back of the grove and knew that those in front had breached the wall. He sent another bow shot through the thick canopy of bent trees, just for good measure, and hooted loudly three times.\\n\\n In answer, a group of owls swooped down from the pines, bearing down on the orcs along the rock wall. Like the traps, the birds could only cause minimal real damage, but the confusion bought the defenders a little more time.\\n\\n To this point, the only clear advantage for the grove\u0027s defenders came in the northernmost copse, where Bluster and three of his closest and largest bear buddies had a dozen orcs down and a score more running about blindly.\\n\\n One orc, in flight from a bear, came around a tree and nearly crashed into Bluster. The orc kept its wits enough to thrust its spear ahead, but the creature hadn\u0027t the strength to drive the crude weapon through Bluster\u0027s thick hide.\\n\\n Bluster responded with a heavy swipe that sent the orc\u0027s head flying through the trees.\\n\\n Another great bear ambled by, its huge arms wrapped in front of it. The only clue that the bear held an orc in the crushing hug was the orc\u0027s feet, which hung out and kicked wildly below the engulfing fur.\\n\\n Bluster caught sight of another enemy, smaller and quicker than an orc. The bear roared and charged, but the diminutive creature was long gone before he ever got close.\\n\\n Tephanis had no intentions of joining the battle. He had come with the northernmost group mostly to keep out of Graul\u0027s sight, and had planned all along to remain in the trees and wait out the fighting. The trees didn\u0027t seem so safe anymore, so the sprite lighted out, meaning to get into the southern copse.\\n\\n About halfway to the other woods, the sprite\u0027s plans were foiled again. Sheer speed nearly got him past the trap before the iron jaws snapped closed, but the wicked teeth just caught the end his foot. The ensuing jolt blasted the breath from him and left him dazed, facedown in the grass.\\n\\n Drizzt knew how revealing that little fire on the quarrel would prove, so he was hardly surprised when another giant-hurled rock thundered in. It struck Drizzt\u0027s bending branch, and with a series of cracks, the limb swung down.\\n\\n Drizzthooked the crossbow with his foot as he dropped, and he hit the trigger immediately, before the weapon was deflected too far aside. Then he stubbornly held his position and watched.\\n\\n The fiery quarrel reached out into the darkness beyond the eastern rock wall. It skidded in low, sending sparks up through the tall grass, then thudded into the side - the outside - of the brandy-filled trough.\\n\\n The first half of the worg-riders got across the trap, but the remaining three were not so lucky, bearing in just as flames licked over the side of the dugout. The brandy and kindling roared to life as the riders plunged through. Worgs and orcs thrashed about in the tall grass, setting other pockets of fire.\\n\\n Those who had already come through spun about abruptly at the sudden conflagration. One orc rider was thrown heavily, landing on its own torch, and the other two barely kept their seats. Above all else, worgs hated fire, and the sight of three of their kin rolling about, furry balls of flame, did little to strengthen their resolve for this battle.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar came to a small, level area dominated by a single maple. Onlookers to the panther\u0027s rush would have blinked incredulously, wondering if the vertical tree trunk was really a log lying on its side, so fast did Guenhwyvar run up it.\\n\\n The worg pack came in soon after, sniffing and milling about, certain that the cat was up the tree but unable to pick out Guenhwyvar\u0027s black form among the dark boughs.\\n\\n The panther showed itself soon enough, though, again dropping heavily to the back of the winter wolf, and this time taking care to lock its jaws onto Caroak\u0027s ear.\\n\\n The winter wolf thrashed and yelped as Guenhwyvar\u0027s claws did their work. Caroak managed to turn about and Guenhwyvar heard the sharp intake of breath, the same as the one preceding the previous chilling blast.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar\u0027s huge neck muscles flexed, forcing Caroak\u0027s open jaws to the side. The foul breath came anyway, blasting three charging worgs right in the face.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar\u0027s muscles reversed and flexed again suddenly, and the panther heard Caroak\u0027s neck snap. The winter wolf plopped straight down, Guenhwyvar still atop it.\\n\\n Those three worgs closest to Guenhwyvar, the three who had caught Caroak\u0027s icy breath, posed no threat. One lay on its side, gasping for air that would not move through its frozen lungs, another turned tight circles, fully blinded, and the last stood perfectly still, staring down at its forelegs, which, for some reason, would not answer its call to move.\\n\\n The rest of the pack, though, nearly a score strong, came in methodically, surrounding the panther in a deadly ring. Guenhwyvar looked all about for some escape, but the worgs did not rush frantically, leaving openings.\\n\\n They worked in harmony, shoulder to shoulder, tightening the ring.\\n\\n The leading orcs milled about the tangle of bent trees, looking for some way through. Some had begun to make progress, but the whole of the trap was interconnected, and any one of a dozen trip wires would send all the pines springing up.\\n\\n One of the orcs found Montolio\u0027s net, then, the hard way. It stumbled over a rope, fell facedown on the net, then went high into the air, one of its companions caught beside it. Neither of them could have imagined how much better off they were than those they had left behind, particularly the orc unsuspectingly straddling the knife-set rope. When the trees sprang up, so did this devilish trap, gutting the creature and lifting it head over heels into the air.\\n\\n Even those orcs not caught by the secondary traps did not fare well. Tangled branches, bristling with prickly pine needles, shot up all about them, sending a few on a pretty fair ride and scratching and disorienting the others.\\n\\n Even worse for the orcs, Montolio used the sound of the rushing trees as his signal to open fire. Arrow after arrow whistled down the sheltered run, more hitting the mark than not. One orc lifted its spear to throw, then caught one arrow in the face and another in the chest. Another beast turned and fled, crying \"Bad magic!\" frantically.\\n\\n To those crossing the rock wall, the screamer seemed to fly, its feet kicking above the ground. Its startled companions understood when the orc came back down in a heap, a quivering arrow shaft protruding from its back.\\n\\n Drizzt, still on his tenuous perch, didn\u0027t have time to marvel at the efficient execution of Montolio\u0027s well-laid plans. From the west, the giant was now on the move and, back the other way, the two remaining worg-riders had settled enough to resume their charges, torches held high.\\n\\n The ring of snarling worgs tightened. Guenhwyvar could smell their stinking breath. The panther could not hope to charge through the thick ranks, nor could the cat get over them quickly enough to flee.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar found another route. Hind paws tamped down on Caroak\u0027s still-twitching body and the panther arrowed straight up into the air, twenty feet and more. Guenhwyvar caught the maple\u0027s lowest branch with long front claws, hooked on, and pulled itself up. Then the panther disappeared into the boughs, leaving the frustrated pack howling and growling.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar reappeared quickly though, out from the side and back to the ground, and the pack took up the pursuit. The panther had come to know this terrain quite well over the last few weeks and now Guenhwyvar had figured out exactly where to lead the wolves.\\n\\n They ran along a ridge, with a dark and brooding emptiness on their left flank. Guenhwyvar marked well the boulders and the few scattered trees. The panther couldn\u0027t see the chasm\u0027s opposite bank and had to trust fully in its memory. Incredibly fast, Guenhwyvar pivoted suddenly and sprang out into the night, touching down lightly across the wide way and speeding off toward the grove. The worgs would have a long jump - too long for most of them - or a long way back around if they meant to follow.\\n\\n They inched up snarling and scratching at the ground. One poised on the lip and meant to try the leap, but an arrow exploded into its side and destroyed its determination.\\n\\n Worgs were not stupid creatures, and the sight of the arrow put them on the defensive. The ensuing shower by Kellindil and his kin was more than they expected. Dozens of arrows whistled in, dropping the worgs where they stood. Only a few escaped that barrage, and they promptly scattered to the corners of the night.\\n\\n Drizzt called upon another magical trick to stop the torch-bearers. Faerie fire, harmless dancing flames, appeared suddenly below the torch fires, rolling down the wooden instrument to lick at the orcs\u0027 hands. Faerie fire did not burn - was not even warm - but when the orcs saw the flames engulfing their hands, they were far from rational.\\n\\n One of them threw its torch out wide, and the jerking motion cost it its seat. It tumbled down in the grass, and the worg turned yet another time and snarled in frustration.\\n\\n The other orc simply dropped its torch, which fell on top of its mount\u0027s head. Sparks and flames erupted from the worg\u0027s thick coat, stinging its eyes and ears, and the beast went crazy. It dropped into a headlong roll, bouncing right over the startled orc.\\n\\n The orc staggered back to its feet, dazed and bruised and holding its arms out wide as if in apology. The singed worg wasn\u0027t interested in hearing any, however. It sprang straight in and clamped its powerful jaws on the orc\u0027s face.\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t see any of it. The drow could only hope that his trick had worked, for as soon as he had cast the spell, he released his foothold on the crossbow and let the torn branch carry him down to the ground.\\n\\n Two orcs, finally seeing a target, rushed at the drow as he landed, but as soon as Drizzt\u0027s hands were free of the branch, they held his scimitars. The orcs came in, oblivious, and Drizzt slapped their weapons aside and cut them down. The drow waded through more scattered resistance as he made his way to his prepared spot. A grim smile found his face when at last he felt the ranseur\u0027s metal shaft under his bare feet. He remembered the giants back in Maldobar that had slain the innocent family, and he took comfort that now he would kill another of their evil kin.\\n\\n \"Mangura bok woklok!\" Drizzt cried, placing one foot on the root fulcrum and the other on the butt of the hidden weapon.\\n\\n Montolio smiled when he heard the drow\u0027s call, gaining confidence in the proximity of his powerful ally. His bow sang out a few more times, but the ranger sensed that the orcs were coming in at him in a roundabout way, using the thick trees as cover. The ranger waited, baiting them in. Then, just before they closed, Montolio dropped his bow, whipped out his sword and slashed the rope at his side, right below a huge knot. The severed rope rolled up into the air, the knot catching on a fork in the lowest branch, and Montolio\u0027s shield, empowered with one of Drizzt\u0027s darkness spells, dropped down to hang at precisely the right height for the ranger\u0027s waiting arm.\\n\\n Darkness held little influence over the blind ranger, but the few orcs that had come in at Montolio found themselves in a precarious position. They jostled and swung wildly - one cut down its own brother - while Montolio calmly sorted out the melee and went to methodical work. In the matter of a minute, four of the five who had come in were dead or dying and the fifth had taken flight.\\n\\n Far from sated, the ranger and his portable ball of darkness followed, searching for voices or sounds that would lead him to more orcs. Again came the cry that made Montolio smile.\\n\\n \"Mangura bok woklok!\" Drizzt yelled again. An orc tossed a spear at the drow, which Drizzt promptly swatted aside. The distant orc was now unarmed, but Drizzt would not pursue, determinedly holding his position.\\n\\n \"Mangura bok woklok!\" Drizzt cried again. \"Come in, stupid block head!\" This time the giant, approaching the wall in Montolio\u0027s direction, heard the words. The great monster hesitated a moment, regarding the drow curiously.\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t miss the opportunity. \"Mangura bok woklok!\"\\n\\n With a howl and a stamp that shook the earth, the giant kicked a hole in the rock wall and strode toward Drizzt.\\n\\n \"Mangura bok woklok.\" Drizzt said for good measure, angling his feet properly.\\n\\n The giant broke into a dead run, scattering terrified orcs before it and slamming its stone and its club together angrily. It sputtered a thousand curses at Drizzt in those few seconds, words that the drow would never decipher. Three times the drow\u0027s height and many times his weight, the giant loomed over Drizzt, and its rush seemed as though it would surely bury Drizzt where he calmly stood.\\n\\n When the giant got only two long strides from Drizzt, committed fully to its collision course, Drizzt dropped all of his weight onto his back foot. The ranseur\u0027s butt dropped into the hole. Its tip angled up.\\n\\n Drizzt leaped back at the moment the giant plowed into the ranseur. The weapon\u0027s tip and hooked barbs disappeared into the giant\u0027s belly, drove upward through its diaphragm and into its heart and lungs. The metal shaft bowed and seemed as if it would break as its butt end was driven a foot and more into the ground.\\n\\n The ranseur held, and the giant was stopped cold. It dropped its club and rock, reached helplessly for the metal shaft with hands that had not the strength to even close around it. Huge eyes bulged in denial, in terror, and in absolute surprise. The great mouth opened wide and contorted weirdly, but could not even find the wind to scream.\\n\\n Drizzt, too, almost cried out, but caught the words before he uttered them. \"Amazing,\" he said, looking back to where Montolio was fighting, for the cry he nearly shouted was a praise to the goddess Mielikki. Drizzt shook his head helplessly and smiled, stunned by the acute perceptions of his not-so-blind companion.\\n\\n With those thoughts in mind and a sense of righteousness in his heart, Drizzt ran up the shaft and slashed at the giant\u0027s throat with both weapons. He continued on, stepping right on the giant\u0027s shoulder and head and then leaping off toward a group of watching orcs, whooping as he went.\\n\\n The sight of the giant, their bully, quivering and gasping, had already unnerved the orcs, but when this ebony-skinned and wild-eyed drow monster leaped at them, they broke rank altogether. Drizzt\u0027s charge got him to the closest two, and he promptly cut them down and charged on.\\n\\n Twenty feet to the drow\u0027s left, a ball of blackness rolled out of the trees, leading a dozen frightened orcs before it. The orcs knew that to fall within that impenetrable globe was to fall within the blind hermit\u0027s reach and to die.\\n\\n Two orcs and three worgs, all that remained of the torch-bearers, regrouped and slipped quietly toward the grove\u0027s eastern edge. If they could get in behind the enemy, they believed the battle still could be won.\\n\\n The orc farthest to the north never even saw the rushing black form. Guenhwyvar plowed it down and charged on, confident that that one would never rise again.\\n\\n A worg was next in line. Quicker to react than the orc, the worg spun and faced the panther, its teeth bared and jaws snapping.\\n\\n Guenhwyvar snarled, pulling up short right before it. Great claws came in alternately in a series of slaps. The worg could not match the cat\u0027s speed. It swung its jaws from side to side, always a moment too late to catch up to the darting paws. After only five slaps, the worg was defeated. One eye had closed forever, its tongue, half torn, lolled helplessly out one side of its mouth, and its lower jaw was no longer in line with its upper. Only the presence of other targets saved the worg, for when it turned and fled the way it had come, Guenhwyvar, seeing closer prey, did not follow.\\n\\n Drizzt and Montolio had flushed most of the invading force back out over the rock wall. \"Bad magic!\" came the general orc cry, voices edged on desperation. Hooter and his owl companions aided the growing frenzy, flapping down all of a sudden in orc faces, nipping with a talon or beak, then rushing off again into the sky. Still another orc discovered one of the traps as it tried to flee. It went down howling and shrieking, its cries only heightening its companions\u0027 terror.\\n\\n \"No!\" Roddy McGristle cried in disbelief. \"Ye\u0027ve let two beat up yer whole force!\"\\n\\n Graul\u0027s glare settled on the burly man.\\n\\n \"We can turn \u0027em back,\" Roddy said. \"If they see ye, they\u0027ll go back to the fight.\" The mountain man\u0027s appraisal was not off the mark. If Graul and Roddy had made their entrance then, the orcs, still numbering more than fifty, might have regrouped. With most of their traps exhausted, Drizzt and Montolio would have been in a sore position indeed! But the orc king had seen another brewing problem to the north and had decided, despite Roddy\u0027s protests, that the old man and the dark elf simply weren\u0027t worth the effort.\\n\\n Most of the orcs in the field heard the newest danger before they saw it, for Bluster and his friends were a noisy lot. The largest obstacle the bears found as they rolled through the orc ranks was picking out a single target in the mad rush. They swatted orcs as they passed, then chased them into the copse and beyond, all the way back to their holes by the river. It was high spring; the air was charged with energy and excitement, and how these playful bears loved to swat orcs!\\n\\n The whole horde of rushing bodies swarmed right past the fallen quickling. When Tephanis awoke, he found that he was the only one alive on the blood-soaked field. Growls and shouts wafted in from the west, the fleeing band, and sounds of battle still sounded in the ranger\u0027s grove. Tephanis knew that his part in the battle, minor though it had been, was over. Tremendous pain rolled up the sprite\u0027s leg, more pain than he had ever known. He looked down to his torn foot and to his horror realized that the only way out of the wicked trap was to complete the gruesome cut, losing the end of his foot and all five of his toes in the process. It was not a difficult job - the foot was hanging by a thin piece of skin - and Tephanis did not hesitate, fearing that the drow would come out at any moment and find him.\\n\\n The quickling stifled his scream and covered the wound with his torn shirt, then ambled - slowly - off into the trees.\\n\\n The orc crept along silently, glad for the covering noises of the fight between the panther and a worg. All thoughts of killing the old man or the drow had flown from this orc now; it had seen its comrades chased away by a pack of bears. Now the orc only wanted to find a way out, not an easy feat in the thick, low tangle of pine branches.\\n\\n It stepped on some dry leaves as it came into one clear area and froze at the resounding crackle. The orc glanced to the left, then slowly brought its head back around to the right. All of a sudden, it jumped and spun, expecting an attack from the rear. But all was clear as far as it could tell and all, except for the distant panther growls and worg yelps, was quiet. The orc let out a profound sigh of relief and sought the trail once again.\\n\\n It stopped suddenly on instinct and threw its head way back to look up. A dark form crouched on a branch just above the orc\u0027s head, and the silvery flash shot down before the orc could begin to react. The curve of the scimitar\u0027s blade proved perfect for slipping around the orc\u0027s chin and diving into its throat.\\n\\n The orc stood very still, arms wide and twitching, and tried to scream, but the whole length of its larynx was torn apart. The scimitar came out in a rush and the orc fell backward into death.\\n\\n Not so far away, another orc finally extracted itself from the hanging net and quickly cut free its buddy. The two of them, enraged and not as anxious to run away without a fight, crept in quietly.\\n\\n \"In the dark,\" the first explained as they came through one thicket and found the landscape blotted out by an impenetrable globe. \"Deep.\"\\n\\n Together, the orcs raised their spears and threw, grunting savagely with the effort. The spears disappeared into the dark globe, dead center, one banging into a metallic object but the other striking something softer.\\n\\n The orcs\u0027 cries of victory were cut short by two twangs of a bowstring. One of the creatures lurched forward, dead before it hit the ground, but the other, stubbornly holding its footing, managed to look down to its chest, to the protruding point of an arrowhead. It lived long enough to see Montolio casually stride past and disappear into the darkness to retrieve his shield.\\n\\n Drizzt watched the old man from a distance, shaking his head and wondering.\\n\\n \"It is ended,\" the elven scout told the others when they caught up to him among the boulders just south of Mooshie\u0027s Grove.\\n\\n \"I am not so certain,\" Kellindil replied, looking curiously back to the west and hearing the echoes of bear growls and orc screams. Kellindil suspected that something beyond Graul was behind this attack and, feeling somewhat responsible for the drow, he wanted to know what it might be.\\n\\n \"The ranger and drow have won the grove,\" the scout explained.\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" said Kellindil, \"and so your part is ended. Go back, all of you, to the campsite,\"\\n\\n \"And will you join us?\" one of the elves asked, though he had already guessed the answer.\\n\\n \"If the fates decree it,\" Kellindil replied. \"For now, I have other business to attend.\"\\n\\n The others did not question Kellindil further. Rarely did he come to their realm and never did he remain with them for long. Kellindil was an adventurer; the road was his home. He set off at once, running to catch up to the fleeing orcs, then paralleling their movements just south of them.\\n\\n \"Ye let just two of them beat ye!\" Roddy griped when he and Graul had a moment to stop and catch their breath. \"Two of them!\"\\n\\n Graul\u0027s answer came in the swing of a heavy club. Roddy partially blocked the blow, but its weight knocked him backward.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re to pay for that!\" the mountain man growled, tearing Bleeder from his belt. A dozen of Graul\u0027s minions appeared beside the orc king then and immediately understood the situation.\\n\\n \"Yous has brought ruin to us!\" Graul snapped at Roddy. Then to his orcs, he shouted, \"Kill him!\"\\n\\n Roddy\u0027s dog tripped the closest of the group and Roddy didn\u0027t wait for the others to catch up.
