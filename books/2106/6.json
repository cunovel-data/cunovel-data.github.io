{"id":91453,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The goblin guards dove to the side as mighty Ulgulu tore through the curtain and exited the cave complex. The open, crisp air of the chill mountain night felt good to the barghest, better still when Ulgulu thought of the task before him. He looked to the scimitar that Tephanis had delivered, the crafted weapon appearing tiny in Ulgulu\u0027s huge, dark-skinned hand.\\n\\n Ulgulu unconsciously dropped the weapon to the ground. He didn\u0027t want to use it this night; the barghest wanted to put his own deadly weapons - claws and teeth - to use, to taste his victims and devour their life essence so that he could become stronger. Ulgulu was an intelligent creature, though, and his rationale quickly overruled the base instincts that so desired the taste of blood. There was purpose in this night\u0027s work, a method that promised greater gains and the elimination of the very real threat that the dark elf\u0027s unexpected appearance posed.\\n\\n With a guttural snarl, a small protest from Ulgulu\u0027s base urges, the barghest grabbed the scimitar again and pounded down the mountainside, covering long distances with each stride. The beast stopped on the edge of a ravine, where a single narrow trail wound down along the sheer facing of the cliff. It would take him many minutes to scale down the dangerous trail.\\n\\n But Ulgulu was hungry.\\n\\n Ulgulu\u0027s consciousness fell back into itself, focusing on that spot of his being that fluctuated with magical energy. He was not a creature of the Material Plane, and extra-planar creatures inevitably brought with them powers that would seem magical to creatures of the host plane. Ulgulu\u0027s eyes glowed orange with excitement when he emerged from his trance just a few moments later. He peered down the cliff, visualizing a spot on the flat ground below, perhaps a quarter of a mile away.\\n\\n A shimmering, multicolored door appeared before Ulgulu, hanging in the air beyond the lip of the ravine. His laughter sounding more like a roar, Ulgulu pushed open the door and found, just beyond its threshold, the spot he had visualized. He moved through, circumventing the material distance to the ravine\u0027s floor with a single extradimensional step.\\n\\n Ulgulu ran on, down the mountain and toward the human village, ran on eagerly to set the gears of his cruel plan turning.\\n\\n As the barghest approached the lowest mountain slopes, he again found that magical corner of his mind. Ulgulu\u0027s strides slowed, then the creature stopped altogether, jerking spasmodically and gurgling indecipherably. Bones ground together with popping noises, skin ripped and reformed, darkening nearly to black.\\n\\n When Ulgulu started away again, his strides - the strides of a dark elf - were not so long.\\n\\n Bartholemew Thistledown sat with his father, Markhe, and his oldest son that evening in the kitchen of the lone farmhouse on the western outskirts of Maldobar. Bartholemew\u0027s wife and mother had gone out to the barn to settle the animals for the night, and the four youngest children were safely tucked into their beds in the small room off the kitchen.\\n\\n On a normal night the rest of the Thistledown family, all three generations, would also be snugly snoring in their beds, but Bartholemew feared that many nights would pass before any semblance of normalcy returned to the quiet farm. A dark elf had been spotted in the area, and while Bartholemew wasn\u0027t convinced that this stranger meant harm - the drow easily could have killed Connor and the other children - he knew that the drow\u0027s appearance would cause a stir in Maldobar for quite some time.\\n\\n \"We could get back to the town proper,\" Connor offered. \"They\u0027d find us a place, and all of Maldobar\u0027d stand behind us then.\"\\n\\n \"Stand behind us?\" Bartholemew responded with sarcasm. \"And would they be leaving their farms each day to come out here and help us keep up with our work? Which of them, do ye think, might ride out here each night to tend to the animals?\"\\n\\n Connor\u0027s head drooped at his father\u0027s berating. He slipped one hand to the hilt of his sword, reminding himself that he was no child. Still, Connor was silently grateful for the supporting hand his grandfather casually dropped on his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027ve got to think, boy, before ye make such calls,\" Bartholemew continued, his tone mellowing as he began to realize the profound effect his harsh words had on his son. \"The farm\u0027s yer lifeblood, the only thing that matters.\"\\n\\n \"We could send the little ones,\" Markhe put in. \"The boy\u0027s got a right to be fearing, with a dark elf about and all.\"\\n\\n Bartholemew turned away and resignedly dropped his chin into his palm. He hated the thought of breaking apart the family. Family was their source of strength, as it had been through five generations of Thistledowns and beyond. Yet, here Bartholemew was berating Connor, even though the boy had spoken only for the good of the family.\\n\\n \"I should have thought better, Dad,\" he heard Connor whisper, and he knew that his own pride could not hold out against the realization of Connor\u0027s pain. \"I am sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Ye needn\u0027t be,\" Bartholemew replied, turning back to the others. \"I\u0027m the one should apologize. All of us got our neck hairs up with this dark elf about. Ye\u0027re right in yer thinking, Connor. We\u0027re too far out here to be safe.\"\\n\\n As if in answer came a sharp crack of breaking wood and a muffled cry from outside the house, from the direction of the barn. In that single horrible moment, Bartholemew Thistledown realized that he should have come to his decision earlier, when the revealing light of day still offered his family some measure of protection.\\n\\n Connor reacted first, running to the door and throwing it open. The farmyard was deathly quiet; not the chirp of a cricket disturbed the surrealistic scene. A silent moon loomed low in the sky, throwing long and devious shadows from every fencepost and tree. Connor watched, not daring to breathe, through the passing of a second that seemed like an hour.\\n\\n The barn door creaked and toppled from its hinges. A dark elf walked out into the farmyard.\\n\\n Connor shut the door and fell back against it, needing its tangible support. \"Ma,\" he breathed to the startled faces of his father and grandfather. \"Drow.\"\\n\\n The older Thistledown men hesitated, their minds whirling through the tumult of a thousand horrible notions. They simultaneously leaped from their seats, Bartholemew going for a weapon and Markhe moving toward Connor and the door.\\n\\n Their sudden action freed Connor from his paralysis. He pulled the sword from his belt and swung the door open, meaning to rush out and face the intruder.\\n\\n A single spring of his powerful legs had brought Ulgulu right up to the farmhouse door. Connor charged over the threshold blindly, slammed into the creature - which only appeared like a slender drow - and bounced back, stunned, into the kitchen. Before any of the men could react, the scimitar slammed down onto the top of Connor\u0027s head with all the strength of the barghest behind it, nearly splitting the young man in half.\\n\\n Ulgulu stepped unhindered into the kitchen. He saw the old man - the lesser remaining enemy - reaching out for him, and called upon his magical nature to defeat the attack. A wave of imparted emotion swept over Markhe Thistledown, a wave of despair and terror so great that he could not combat it. His wrinkled mouth shot open in a silent scream and he staggered backward, crashing into a wall and clutching helplessly at his chest.\\n\\n Bartholemew Thistledown\u0027s charge carried the weight of unbridled rage behind it. The farmer growled and gasped unintelligible sounds as he lowered his pitchfork and bore down on the intruder that had murdered his son.\\n\\n The slender, assumed frame that held the barghest did not diminish Ulgulu\u0027s gigantic strength. As the pitchfork\u0027s tips closed the last inches to the creature\u0027s chest, Ulgulu slapped a single hand on the weapon\u0027s shaft. Bartholemew stopped in his tracks, the butt end of the pitchfork driving hard into his belly, blowing away his breath.\\n\\n Ulgulu raised his arm quickly, lifting Bartholemew clear off the floor and slamming the farmer\u0027s head into a ceiling beam with enough force to break his neck. The barghest casually tossed Bartholemew and his pitiful weapon across the kitchen and stalked over to the old man.\\n\\n Perhaps Markhe saw him coming; perhaps the old man was too torn by pain and anguish to register any events in the room. Ulgulu moved to him and opened his mouth wide. He wanted to devour the old man, to feast on this one\u0027s life force as he had with the younger woman out in the barn. Ulgulu had lamented his actions in the barn as soon as the ecstacy of the kill had faded. Again the barghest\u0027s rationale displaced his base urges. With a frustrated snarl, Ulgulu drove the scimitar into Markhe\u0027s chest, ending the old man\u0027s pain.\\n\\n Ulgulu looked around at his gruesome work, lamenting that he had not feasted on the strong young farmers but reminding himself of the greater gains his actions this night would yield. A confused cry led him to the side room, where the children slept.\\n\\n Drizzt came down from the mountains tentatively the next day. His wrist, where the sprite had stabbed him, throbbed, but the wound was clean and Drizzt was confident that it would heal. He crouched in the brush on the hillside behind the Thistledown farm, ready to try another meeting with the children. Drizzt had seen too much of the human community, and had spent too much time alone, to give up. This was where he intended to make his home if he could get beyond the obvious prejudicial barriers, personified most keenly by the large man with the snarling dogs.\\n\\n From this angle, Drizzt couldn\u0027t see the blasted barn door, and all appeared as it should on the farm in the predawn glow.\\n\\n The farmers did not come out with the sun, however, and always before they had been out no later than its arrival. A rooster crowed and several animals shuffled around the barnyard, but the house remained silent. Drizzt knew this was unusual, but he figured that the encounter in the mountains on the previous day had sent the farmers into hiding. Possibly the family had left the farm altogether, seeking the shelter of the larger cluster of houses in the village proper. The thoughts weighed heavily on Drizzt; again he had disrupted the lives of those around him simply by showing his face. He remembered Blingdenstone, the city of svirfneblin gnomes, and the tumult and potential danger his appearance had brought to them.\\n\\n The sunny day brightened, but a chill breeze blew down off the mountains. Still not a person stirred in the farmyard or within the house, as far as Drizzt could tell. The drow watched it all, growing more concerned with each passing second.\\n\\n A familiar buzzing noise shook Drizzt from his contemplations. He drew his lone scimitar and glanced around. He wished he could call Guenhwyvar, but not enough time had passed since the cat\u0027s last visit. The panther needed to rest in its astral home for another day before it would be strong enough to walk beside Drizzt. Seeing nothing in his immediate area, Drizzt moved between the trunks of two large trees, a more defensible position against the sprite\u0027s blinding speed.\\n\\n The buzzing was gone an instant later, and the sprite was nowhere to be seen. Drizzt spent the rest of that day moving about the brush, setting trip wires and digging shallow pits. If he and the sprite were to battle again, the drow was determined to change the outcome.\\n\\n The lengthening shadows and crimson western sky brought Drizzt\u0027s attention back to the Thistledown farm. No candles were lighted within the farmhouse to defeat the deepening gloom.\\n\\n Drizzt grew ever more concerned. The return of the nasty sprite had poignantly reminded him of the dangers in the region, and with the continuing inactivity in the farmyard, a fear budded within him, took root, and quickly grew into a sense of dread.\\n\\n Twilight darkened into night. The moon rose and climbed steadily into the eastern sky.\\n\\n Still not a candle burned in the house, and not a sound came through the darkened windows.\\n\\n Drizzt slipped out of the brush and darted across the short back field. He had no intentions of getting close to the house; he just wanted to see what he might learn. Perhaps the horses and the farmer\u0027s small wagon would be gone, lending evidence to Drizzt\u0027s earlier suspicion that the farmers had taken refuge in the village.\\n\\n When he came around the side of the barn and saw the broken door, Drizzt knew instinctively that this was not the case. His fears grew with every step. He peered through the barn door and was not surprised to see the wagon sitting in the middle of the barn and the stalls full of horses.\\n\\n To the side of the wagon, though, lay the older woman, crumbled and covered in her own dried blood. Drizzt went to her and knew at once that she was dead, killed by some sharp-edged weapon. Immediately his thoughts went to the evil sprite and his own missing scimitar. When he found the other corpse, behind the wagon, he knew that some other monster, something more vicious and powerful, had been involved. Drizzt couldn\u0027t even identify this second, half-eaten body.\\n\\n Drizzt ran from the barn to the farmhouse, throwing out all caution. He found the bodies of the Thistledown men in the kitchen and, to his ultimate horror, the children lying too still in their beds. Waves of revulsion and guilt rolled over the drow when he looked upon the young bodies. The word \"drizzit\" chimed painfully in his mind at the sight of the sandy-haired lad.\\n\\n The tumult of Drizzt\u0027s emotions were too much for him. He covered his ears against that damning word, \"drizzit!\" but it echoed endlessly, haunting him, reminding him.\\n\\n Unable to find his breath, Drizzt ran from the house. If he had searched the room more carefully, he would have found, under the bed, his missing scimitar, snapped in half and left for the villagers. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-sojourn-the-dark-elf-trilogy-3/page-6.html","bookId":2106,"book":{"id":2106,"title":"The Dark Elf Trilogy: Sojourn (The Dark Elf Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: Far above the merciless Underdark, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden fights to survive the elements of Toril\u0027s harsh surface.
