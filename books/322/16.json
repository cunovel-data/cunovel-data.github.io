{"id":20591,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. MARK GETS A PLACE.","content":"In a week from the purchase of the books, Mark felt that he was fully recovered. He never had much color, but the unhealthy pallor had left his cheeks, and he had an excellent appetite. \"Well, Mark, how do you feel to-night?\" asked Richard, on his return from the store one evening. \"I\u0027m all right, now, Mr. Hunter. I think I will go to work to-morrow morning.\" \"What sort of work?\" \"Selling matches.\" \"Do you like to sell matches?\" \"I like it better than selling papers, or blacking boots.\" \"But wouldn\u0027t you like better to be in a store?\" \"I couldn\u0027t get a place,\" said Mark. \"Why not?\" \"My clothes are ragged,\" said the match boy with some hesitation. \"Besides I haven\u0027t got anybody to refer to.\" \"Can\u0027t you refer to your guardian?\" asked Richard Hunter, smiling. \"Do you think I had better try to get a place in a store, Mr. Hunter?\" asked Mark. \"Yes, I think it would be much better for you than to sell matches on the street. You are not a strong boy, and the exposure is not good for you. As to your clothes, we\u0027ll see if we cannot supply you with something better than you have on.\" \"But,\" said Mark, \"I want to pay for my clothes myself. I have got ten dollars in the bank at the Newsboys\u0027 Lodge.\" \"Very well. You can go down to-morrow morning and get it. But we needn\u0027t wait for that. I will go and get you some clothes before I go to business.\" In the morning Richard Hunter went out with the match boy, and for twenty dollars obtained for him a very neat gray suit, besides a supply of under-clothing. Mark put them on at once, and felt not a little pleased with the improvement in his appearance. \"You can carry your old clothes to Mr. O\u0027Connor,\" said Richard. \"They are not very good, but they are better than none, and he may have an opportunity of giving them away.\" \"You have been very kind to me, Mr. Hunter,\" said Mark, gratefully. \"Good-by.\" \"Good-by? What makes you say that?\" \"Because I am going now to the Newsboys\u0027 Lodge.\" \"Yes, but you are coming back again.\" \"But I think I had better go there to live now. It will be much cheaper, and I ought not to put you to so much expense.\" \"You\u0027re a good boy, Mark, but you must remember that I am your guardian, and am to be obeyed as such. You\u0027re not going back to the Lodge to live. I have arranged to have you stay with me at my boarding-place. As soon as you have got a place you will work in the daytime, and every Saturday night you will bring me your money. In the evening I shall have you study a little, for I don\u0027t want you to grow up as ignorant as I was at your age.\" \"Were you ignorant, Mr. Hunter?\" asked Mark, with interest. \"Yes, I was,\" said Richard. \"When I was fourteen, I couldn\u0027t read nor write.\" \"I can hardly believe that, Mr. Hunter,\" said Mark. \"You\u0027re such a fine scholar.\" \"Am I?\" asked Richard, smiling, yet well pleased with the compliment. \"Why, you can read French as fast as I can read English, and write beautifully.\" \"Well, I had to work hard to do it,\" said Richard Hunter. \"But I feel paid for all the time I\u0027ve spent in trying to improve myself. Sometimes I\u0027ve thought I should like to spend the evening at some place of amusement rather than in study; but if I had, there\u0027d be nothing to show for it now. Take my advice, Mark, and study all you can, and you\u0027ll grow up respectable and respected.\" \"Now,\" he added, after a pause, \"I\u0027ll tell you what you may do. You may look in my \u0027Herald\u0027 every morning, and whenever you see a boy advertised for you can call, or whenever, in going along the street, you see a notice \u0027Boy wanted,\u0027 you may call in, and sooner or later you\u0027ll get something. If they ask for references, you may refer to Richard Hunter, book-keeper for Rockwell \u0026 Cooper.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Hunter,\" said Mark. \"I will do so.\" On parting with his guardian the match boy went down town to the Lodging House. The superintendent received him kindly. \"I didn\u0027t know what had become of you, Mark,\" he said. \"If it had been some of the boys, I should have been afraid they had got into a scrape, and gone to the Island. But I didn\u0027t think that of you.\" \"I hope you\u0027ll never hear that of me, Mr. O\u0027Connor,\" said Mark. \"I hope not. I\u0027m always sorry to hear of any boy\u0027s going astray. But you seem to have been doing well since I saw you;\" and the superintendent glanced at Mark\u0027s new clothes. \"I\u0027ve met with some kind friends,\" said the match boy. \"I have been sick, and they took care of me.\" \"And now you have come back to the Lodge.\" \"Yes, but not to stay. I came for the money that I have saved up in the bank. It is going for these clothes.\" \"Very well. You shall have it. What is the name of the friend who has taken care of you?\" \"Richard Hunter.\" \"I know him,\" said the superintendent. \"He is an excellent young man. You could not be in better hands.\" On leaving the Lodge Mark felt a desire to find his old ally, Ben Gibson, who, though rather a rough character, had been kind to him. Ben was not difficult to find. During business hours he was generally posted on Nassau Street, somewhere between Fulton Street and Spruce Street. He was just polishing off a customer\u0027s boots when Mark came up, and touched him lightly on the shoulder. Ben looked up, but did not at first recognize the match boy in the neatly dressed figure before him. \"Shine yer boots!\" he asked, in a professional tone. \"Why, Ben, don\u0027t you know me?\" asked Mark, laughing. \"My eyes, if it aint Mark, the match boy!\" exclaimed Ben, in surprise. \"Where\u0027ve you been all this while, Mark?\" \"I\u0027ve been sick, Ben.\" \"I\u0027d like to be sick too, if that\u0027s the way you got them clo\u0027es. I didn\u0027t know what had \u0027come of you.\" \"I found some good friends,\" said Mark. \"If your friends have got any more good clo\u0027es they want to get rid of,\" said Ben, \"tell \u0027em you know a chap that can take care of a few. Are you in the match business now?\" \"I haven\u0027t been doing anything for three weeks,\" said Mark. \"Goin\u0027 to sell matches again?\" \"No.\" \"Sellin\u0027 papers?\" \"No, I\u0027m trying to find a place in a store.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like to be in a store,\" said Ben, reflectively. \"I\u0027m afraid my delicate constitution couldn\u0027t stand the confinement. Besides, I\u0027m my own boss now, and don\u0027t have nobody to order me round.\" \"But you don\u0027t expect to black boots all your life, Ben, do you?\" \"I dunno,\" said Ben. \"Maybe when I\u0027m married, I\u0027ll choose some other business. It would be rather hard to support a family at five cents a shine. Are you comin\u0027 to the Lodge to-night?\" \"No,\" said Mark, \"I\u0027m boarding up at St. Mark\u0027s Place.\" \"Mother Watson hasn\u0027t opened a fashionable boardin\u0027-house up there, has she?\" \"I guess not,\" said Mark, smiling. \"I can\u0027t think what has become of her. I haven\u0027t seen her since the day she tried to carry me off.\" \"I\u0027ve heard of her,\" said Ben. \"She\u0027s stoppin\u0027 with some friends at the Island. They won\u0027t let her come away on account of likin\u0027 her company so much.\" \"I hope I shall never see her again,\" said Mark, with a shudder. \"She is a wicked old woman. But I must be going, Ben.\" \"I s\u0027pose you\u0027ll come and see a feller now and then.\" \"Yes, Ben, when I get time. But I hope to get a place soon.\" Mark walked leisurely up Broadway. Having been confined to the house for three weeks, he enjoyed the excitement of being out in the street once more. The shop windows looked brighter and gayer than before, and the little match boy felt that the world was a very pleasant place after all. He had passed Eighth Street before he was fairly aware of the distance he had traversed. He found himself looking into the window of a bookstore. While examining the articles in the window his eye suddenly caught the notice pasted in the middle of the glass on a piece of white paper:— \"BOY WANTED.\" \"Perhaps they\u0027ll take me,\" thought Mark, suddenly. \"At any rate I\u0027ll go in and see.\" Accordingly he entered the store, and looked about him a little undecidedly. \"Well, sonny, what do you want?\" asked a clerk. \"I see that you want a boy,\" said Mark. \"Yes. Do you want a place?\" \"I am trying to get one.\" \"Well, go and see that gentleman about it.\" He pointed to a gentleman who was seated at a desk in the corner of the store. \"Please, sir, do you want a boy?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said the gentleman. \"How old are you?\" \"Ten years old.\" \"You are rather young. Have you been in any place before?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you know your way about the city pretty well?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I want a boy to deliver papers and magazines, and carry small parcels of books. Do you think you could do that?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Without stopping to play on the way?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I have just discharged one boy, because he was gone an hour and a half on an errand to Twentieth Street. You are the first boy that has answered my advertisement. I\u0027ll try you on a salary of three dollars a week, if you can go to work at once. What is your name?\" \"Mark Manton.\" \"Very well, Mark. Go to Mr. Jones, behind the counter there, and he will give you a parcel to carry to West Twenty-First Street.\" \"I\u0027m in luck,\" thought Mark. \"I didn\u0027t expect to get a place so easily.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82473.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
