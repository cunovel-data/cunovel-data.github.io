{"id":20600,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. AN EXCURSION TO FORT HAMILTON.","content":"Towards the close of May there was a general holiday, occasioned by the arrival of a distinguished stranger in the city. All the stores were to be closed, there was to be a turnout of the military, and a long procession. Among those released from duty were our three friends, Fosdick, Richard Hunter, and his ward Mark. \"Well, Dick, what are you going to do to-morrow?\" inquired Fosdick, on the evening previous. \"I was expecting an invitation to ride in a barouche with the mayor,\" said Richard; \"but probably he forgot my address and couldn\u0027t send it. On the whole I\u0027m glad of it, being rather bashful and not used to popular enthusiasm.\" \"Shall you go out and see the procession?\" continued Fosdick. \"No,\" said Dick; \"I have been thinking of another plan, which I think will be pleasanter.\" \"What is it?\" \"It\u0027s a good while since we took an excursion. Suppose we go to Fort Hamilton to-morrow.\" \"I should like that,\" said Fosdick. \"I was never there. How do we get there?\" \"Cross over Fulton Ferry to Brooklyn, and there we might take the cars to Fort Hamilton. It\u0027s seven or eight miles out there.\" \"Why do you say \u0027might\u0027 take the cars?\" \"Because the cars will be crowded with excursionists, and I have been thinking we might hire a carriage on the Brooklyn side, and ride out there in style. It\u0027ll cost more money, but we don\u0027t often take a holiday, and we can afford it for once. What you do say, Mark?\" \"Do you mean me to go?\" asked Mark, eagerly. \"Of course I do. Do you think your guardian would trust you to remain in the city alone?\" \"I go in for your plan, Dick,\" said Fosdick. \"What time do you want to start?\" \"About half-past nine o\u0027clock. That will give us plenty of time to go. Then, after exploring the fort, we can get dinner at the hotel, and drive where we please afterwards. I suppose there is sea-bathing near by.\" Dick\u0027s idea was unanimously approved, and by no one more than by Mark. Holidays had been few and far between with him, and he anticipated the excursion with the most eager delight. He was only afraid that the weather would prove unpropitious. He was up at four, looking out of the window; but the skies were clear, and soon the sun came out with full radiance, dissipating the night-shadows, and promising a glorious day. Breakfast was later than usual, as people like to indulge themselves in a little longer sleep on Sundays and holidays; but it was over by half-past eight, and within a few minutes from that time the three had taken the cars to Fulton Ferry. In about half an hour the ferry was reached, and, passing through, the party went on board the boat. They had scarcely done so, when an exclamation of surprise was heard, proceeding from feminine lips, and Dick heard himself called by name. \"Why, Mr. Hunter, this is an unexpected pleasure. I am so glad to have met you.\" Turning his head, Dick recognized Mr. and Mrs. Clifton. Both had been fellow-boarders with him in Bleecker Street. The latter will be remembered by the readers of \"Fame and Fortune\" as Miss Peyton. When close upon the verge of old-maidenhood she had been married, for the sake of a few thousand dollars which she possessed, by Mr. Clifton, a clerk on a small salary, in constant pecuniary difficulties. With a portion of his wife\u0027s money he had purchased a partnership in a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue; but the remainder of her money Mrs. Clifton had been prudent enough to have settled upon herself. Mrs. Clifton still wore the same ringlets, and exhibited the same youthful vivacity which had characterized her when an inmate of Mrs. Browning\u0027s boarding-house, and only owned to being twenty-four, though she looked full ten years older. \"How d\u0027e do, Hunter?\" drawled Mr. Clifton, upon whose arm his wife was leaning. \"Very well, thank you,\" said Dick. \"I see Mrs. Clifton is as fascinating as ever.\" \"O you wicked flatterer!\" said Mrs. Clifton, shaking her ringlets, and tapping Dick on the shoulder with her fan. \"And here is Mr. Fosdick too, I declare. How do you do, Mr. Fosdick?\" \"Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Clifton.\" \"I declare I\u0027ve a great mind to scold you for not coming round to see us. I should so much like to hear you sing again.\" \"My friend hasn\u0027t sung since your marriage, Mrs. Clifton,\" said Dick. \"He took it very much to heart. I don\u0027t think he has forgiven Clifton yet for cutting him out.\" \"Mr. Hunter is speaking for himself,\" said Fosdick, smiling. \"He has sung as little as I have.\" \"Yes, but for another reason,\" said Dick. \"I did not think it right to run the risk of driving away the boarders; so, out of regard to my landlady, I repressed my natural tendency to warble.\" \"I see you\u0027re just as bad as ever,\" said Mrs. Clifton, in excellent spirits. \"But really you must come round and see us. We are boarding in West Sixteenth Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.\" \"If your husband will promise not to be jealous, \"said Dick. \"I\u0027m not subject to that complaint,\" said Clifton, coolly. \"Got a cigar about you, Hunter?\" \"No. I don\u0027t smoke.\" \"No, don\u0027t you though? I couldn\u0027t get along without it. It\u0027s my great comfort.\" \"Yes, he\u0027s always smoking,\" said Mrs. Clifton, with some asperity. \"Our rooms are so full of tobacco smoke, that I don\u0027t know but some of my friends will begin to think I smoke myself.\" \"A man must have some pleasure,\" said Clifton, not appearing to be much discomposed by his wife\u0027s remarks. It may be mentioned that although Mrs. Clifton was always gay and vivacious in company, there were times when she could display considerable ill-temper, as her husband frequently had occasion to know. Among the sources of difficulty and disagreement was that portion of Mrs. Clifton\u0027s fortune which had been settled upon herself, and of which she was never willing to allow her husband the use of a single dollar. In this, however, she had some justification, as he was naturally a spendthrift, and, if placed in his hands, it would soon have melted away. \"Where are you going, Mr. Hunter?\" inquired Mrs. Clifton, after a pause. \"Fosdick and I have planned to take a carriage and ride to Fort Hamilton.\" \"Delightful!\" said Mrs. Clifton. \"Why can\u0027t we go too, Mr. Clifton?\" \"Why, to tell the plain truth,\" said her husband, \"I haven\u0027t got money enough with me. If you\u0027ll pay for the carriage, I\u0027m willing to go.\" Mrs. Clifton hesitated. She had money enough with her, but was not inclined to spend it. Still the prospect of making a joint excursion with Richard Hunter and Fosdick was attractive, and she inquired:— \"How much will it cost?\" \"About five dollars probably.\" \"Then I think we\u0027ll go,\" she said, \"that is, if our company would not be disagreeable to Mr. Hunter.\" \"On the contrary,\" said Dick. \"We will get separate carriages, but I will invite you both to dine with us after visiting the fort.\" Mr. Clifton brightened up at this, and straightway became more social and cheerful. \"Mrs. Clifton,\" said Richard Hunter, \"I believe I haven\u0027t yet introduced you to my ward.\" \"Is that your ward?\" inquired the lady, looking towards Mark. \"What is his name?\" \"Mark Manton.\" \"How do you like your guardian?\" inquired Mrs. Clifton. \"Very much,\" said Mark, smiling. \"Then I won\u0027t expose him,\" said Mrs. Clifton. \"We used to be great friends before I married.\" \"Since that sad event I have never recovered my spirits,\" said Dick. \"Mark will tell you what a poor appetite I have.\" \"Is that true, Mark?\" asked the lady. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s very poor,\" said Mark, with a smile. Probably my readers will not consider this conversation very brilliant; but Mrs. Clifton was a silly woman, who was fond of attention, and was incapable of talking sensibly. Richard would have preferred not to have her husband or herself in the company, but, finding it inevitable, submitted to it with as good a grace as possible. Carriage were secured at a neighboring stable, and the two parties started. The drive was found to be very pleasant, particularly the latter portion, when a fresh breeze from the sea made the air delightfully cool. As they drove up beside the fort, they heard the band within, playing a march, and, giving their horses in charge, they were soon exploring the interior. The view from the ramparts proved to be fine, commanding a good view of the harbor and the city of New York, nearly eight miles distant to the north. \"It is a charming view,\" said Mrs. Clifton, with girlish enthusiasm. \"I know what will be more charming,\" said her husband. \"What is it?\" \"A prospect of the dinner-table. I feel awfully hungry.\" \"Mr. Clifton never thinks of anything but eating,\" said his wife. \"By Jove! you can do your share at that,\" retorted her husband not very gallantly. \"You\u0027d ought to see her eat, Hunter.\" \"I don\u0027t eat more than a little bird,\" said Mrs. Clifton, affectedly. \"I appeal to Mr. Hunter.\" \"If any little bird ate as much as you, he\u0027d be sure to die of dyspepsy,\" said her husband. If the word in italics is incorrectly spelled, I am not responsible, as that is the way Mr. Clifton pronounced it. \"I confess the ride has given me an appetite also,\" said Dick. \"Suppose we go round to the hotel, and order dinner.\" They were soon seated round a bountifully spread dinner-table, to which the whole party, not excepting Mrs. Clifton, did excellent justice. It will not be necessary or profitable to repeat the conversation which seasoned the repast, as, out of deference to Mrs. Clifton\u0027s taste, none of the party ventured upon any sensible remarks. After dinner they extended their drive, and then parted, as Mr. and Mrs. Clifton decided to make a call upon some friends living in the neighborhood. About four o\u0027clock Richard Hunter and his friends started on their return home. They had about reached the Brooklyn city line, when Fosdick suddenly exclaimed:— \"Dick, there\u0027s a carriage overturned a little ways ahead of us. Do you see it?\" Looking in the direction indicated, Dick saw that Fosdick was correct. \"Let us hurry on,\" he said. \"Perhaps we may be able to render some assistance.\" Coming up, they found that a wheel had come off, and a gentleman of middle age was leaning against a tree with an expression of pain upon his features, while a boy of about seventeen was holding the horse. \"Frank Whitney!\" exclaimed Dick, in joyful recognition. To Frank Whitney Dick was indebted for the original impulse which led him to resolve upon gaining a respectable position in society, as will be remembered by the readers of \"Ragged Dick;\" and for this he had always felt grateful. \"Dick!\" exclaimed Frank, in equal surprise. \"I am really glad to see you. You are a friend in need.\" \"Tell me what has happened.\" \"The wheel of our carriage came off, as you see and my uncle was pitched out with considerable violence, and has sprained his ankle badly. I was wondering what to do, when luckily you came up.\" \"Tell me how I can help you,\" said Dick, promptly, \"and I will do so.\" \"We are stopping at the house of a friend in Brooklyn. If you will give my uncle a seat in your carryall, for he is unable to walk, and carry him there, it will be a great favor. I will remain and attend to the horse and carriage.\" \"With pleasure, Frank. Are you going to remain in this neighborhood long?\" \"I shall try to gain admission to the sophomore class of Columbia College this summer, and shall then live in New York, where I hope to see you often. I intended to enter last year, but decided for some reasons to delay a year. However, if I am admitted to advanced standing, I shall lose nothing. Give me your address, and I will call on you very soon.\" \"I am afraid I shall inconvenience you,\" said Mr. Whitney. \"Not at all,\" said Dick, promptly. \"We have plenty of room, and I shall be glad to have an opportunity of obliging one to whom I am indebted for past kindness.\" Mr. Whitney was assisted into the carriage, and they resumed their drive, deviating from their course somewhat, in order to leave him at the house of the friend with whom he was stopping. \"I am very glad to have met Frank again,\" thought Dick: \"I always liked him.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82482.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
