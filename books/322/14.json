{"id":20589,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. WHAT BEFELL THE MATCH BOY.","content":"During the next three months Mark made his home at the Lodging House. He was easily able to meet the small charges of the Lodge for bed and breakfast, and saved up ten dollars besides in the bank. Ben Gibson began to look upon him as quite a capitalist. \"I don\u0027t see how you save up so much money, Mark,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t earn more\u0027n half as much as I do.\" \"It\u0027s because you spend so much, Ben. It costs you considerable for cigars and such things, you know, and then you go to the Old Bowery pretty often.\" \"A feller must have some fun,\" said Ben. \"They\u0027ve got a tearin\u0027 old play at the Bowery now. You\u0027d better come to-night.\" Mark shook his head. \"I feel pretty tired when it comes night,\" he said. \"I\u0027d rather stay at home.\" \"You aint so tough as I am,\" said Ben. \"No,\" said Mark, \"I don\u0027t feel very strong. I think something\u0027s the matter with me.\" \"Nothin\u0027 aint ever the matter with me,\" said Ben, complacently; \"but you\u0027re a puny little chap, that look as if you might blow away some day.\" It was now April, and the weather was of that mild character that saps the strength and produces a feeling of weakness and debility. Mark had been exposed during the winter to the severity of stormy weather, and more than once got thoroughly drenched. It was an exposure that Ben would only have laughed at, but Mark was slightly built, without much strength of constitution, and he had been feeling very languid for a few days, so that it was with an effort that he dragged himself round during the day with his little bundle of matches. This conversation with Ben took place in the morning just as both boys were going to work. They separated at the City Hall Park, Ben finding a customer in front of the \"Times\" building, while Mark, after a little deliberation, decided to go on to Pearl Street with his matches. He had visited the offices in most of the lower streets, but this was a new region to him, and he thought he might meet with better success there. So he kept on his way. The warm sun and the sluggish air made his head ache, and he felt little disposition to offer his wares for sale. He called at one or two offices, but effected no sales. At length he reached a large warehouse with these names displayed on the sign over the door:— \"ROCKWELL \u0026 COOPER.\" This, as the reader will remember, was the establishment in which Richard Hunter, formerly Ragged Dick, was now book-keeper. At this point a sudden faintness came over Mark, and he sank to the ground insensible. A moment before Richard Hunter handed a couple of letters to the office boy,—known to the readers of the earlier volumes in this series as Micky Maguire,—and said, \"Michael, I should like to have you carry these at once to the post-office. On the way you may stop at Trescott \u0026 Wayne\u0027s, and get this bill cashed, if possible.\" \"All right, Mr. Hunter,\" said Michael, respectfully. Richard Hunter and Micky Maguire had been boot-blacks together, and had had more than one contest for the supremacy. They had been sworn enemies, and Micky had done his utmost to injure Richard, but the latter, by his magnanimity, had finally wholly overcome the antipathy of his former foe, and, when opportunity offered, had lifted him to a position in the office where he was himself employed. In return, Micky had become an enthusiastic admirer of Richard, and, so far from taking advantage of their former relations, had voluntarily taken up the habit of addressing him as Mr. Hunter. Michael went out on his errand, but just outside the door came near stepping upon the prostrate form of the little match boy. \"Get up here!\" he said, roughly, supposing at first that Mark had thrown himself down out of laziness and gone to sleep. Mark didn\u0027t answer, and Micky, bending over, saw his fixed expression and waxen pallor. \"Maybe the little chap\u0027s dead,\" he thought, startled, and, without more ado, took him up in his strong arms and carried him into the counting-room. \"Who have you got there, Michael?\" asked Richard Hunter, turning round in surprise. \"A little match boy that was lyin\u0027 just outside the door. He looks as if he might be dead.\" Richard jumped at once from his stool, and, approaching the boy, looked earnestly in his face. \"He has fainted away,\" he said, after a pause. \"Bring some water, quick!\" Micky brought a glass of water, which was thrown in the face of Mark. The match boy gave a little shiver, and, opening his eyes, fixed them upon Richard Hunter. \"Where am I?\" he asked, vacantly. \"You are with friends,\" said Richard, gently. \"You were found at our door faint. Do you feel sick?\" \"I feel weak,\" said Mark. \"Have you been well lately?\" \"No, I\u0027ve felt tired and weak.\" \"Are you a match boy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you parents living?\" \"No,\" said Mark. \"Poor fellow!\" said Richard. \"I know how to pity you. I have no parents either.\" \"But you have got money,\" said Mark. \"You don\u0027t have to live in the street.\" \"I was once a street boy like you.\" \"You!\" repeated the match boy, in surprise. \"Yes. But where do you sleep?\" \"At the Lodging House.\" \"It is a good place. Michael, you had better go to the post-office now.\" Mark looked about him a little anxiously. \"Where are my matches?\" he asked. \"Just outside; I\u0027ll get them,\" said Michael, promptly. He brought them in, and then departed on his errand. \"I guess I\u0027d better be going,\" said Mark, rising feebly. \"No,\" said Richard. \"You are not able. Come here and sit down. You will feel stronger by and by. Did you eat any breakfast this morning?\" \"A little,\" said Mark, \"but I was not very hungry.\" \"Do you think you could eat anything now?\" Mark shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t feel hungry. I only feel tired.\" \"Would you like to rest?\" \"Yes. That\u0027s all I want.\" \"Come here then, and I will see what I can do for you.\" Mark followed his new friend into the warehouse, where Richard found a soft bale of cotton, and told Mark he might lie down upon it. This the poor boy was glad enough to do. In his weakness he was disposed to sleep, and soon closed his eyes in slumber. Several times Richard went out to look at him, but found him dozing, and was unwilling to interrupt him. The day wore away, and afternoon came. Mark got up from his cotton bale, and with unsteady steps came to the door of the counting-room. \"I\u0027m going,\" he said. Richard turned round. \"Where are you going?\" \"I\u0027m going to the Lodge. I think I won\u0027t sell any more matches to-day.\" \"I\u0027ll take all you\u0027ve left,\" said Richard. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself about them. But you are not going to the Lodge.\" Mark looked at him in surprise. \"I shall take you home with me to-night,\" he said. \"You are not well, and I will look after you. At the Lodge there will be a crowd of boys, and the noise will do you harm.\" \"You are very kind,\" said Mark; \"but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll trouble you.\" \"No,\" said Richard, \"I shan\u0027t count it a trouble. I was once a poor boy like you, and I found friends. I\u0027ll be your friend. Go back and lie down again, and in about an hour I shall be ready to take you with me.\" It seemed strange to Mark to think that there was somebody who proposed to protect and look after him. In many of the offices which he visited he met with rough treatment, and was ordered out of the way, as if he were a dog, and without human feelings. Many who treated him in this way were really kind-hearted men who had at home children whom they loved, but they appeared to forget that these neglected children of the street had feelings and wants as well as their own, who were tenderly nurtured. They did not remember that they were somebody\u0027s children, and that cold, and harshness, and want were as hard for them to bear as for those in a higher rank of life. But Mark was in that state of weakness when it seemed sweet to throw off all care or thought for the future, and to sink back upon the soft bale with the thought that he had nothing to do but to rest. \"That boy is going to be sick,\" thought Richard Hunter to himself. \"I think he is going to have a fever.\" It was because of this thought that he decided to carry him home. He had a kind heart, and he knew how terrible a thing sickness is to these little street waifs, who have no mother or sister to smooth their pillows, or cheer them with gentle words. The friendless condition of the little match boy touched his heart, and he resolved that, as he had the means of taking care of him, he would do so. \"Michael,\" he said, at the close of business hours, \"I wish you would call a hack.\" \"What, to come here?\" asked Micky, surprised. \"Yes. I am going to take that little boy home with me. I think he is going to be sick, and I am afraid he would have a hard time of it if I sent him back into the street.\" \"Bully for you, Mr. Hunter!\" said Micky, who, though rough in his outward manners, was yet capable of appreciating kindness in others. There were times indeed in the past when he had treated smaller boys brutally, but it was under the influence of passion. He had improved greatly since, and his better nature was beginning to show itself. Micky went out, and soon returned in state inside a hack. He was leaning back, thinking it would be a very good thing if he had a carriage of his own to ride in. But I am afraid that day will never come. Micky has already turned out much better than was expected, but he is hardly likely to rise much higher than the subordinate position he now occupies. In capacity and education he is far inferior to his old associate, Richard Hunter, who is destined to rise much higher than at present. Richard Hunter went to the rear of the warehouse where Mark still lay on his bale. \"Come,\" he said; \"we\u0027ll go home now.\" Mark rose from his recumbent position, and walked to the door. He saw with surprise the carriage, the door of which Micky Maguire held open. \"Are we going to ride in that?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Richard Hunter. \"Let me help you in.\" The little match boy sank back in the soft seat in vague surprise at his good luck. He could not help wondering what Ben Gibson would say if he could see him now. Richard Hunter sat beside him, and supported Mark\u0027s head. The driver whipped up his horse, and they were speedily on their way up the Bowery to St. Mark\u0027s Place.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82471.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
