{"id":20586,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. ON THE WAR PATH.","content":"Ben led the way to a cheap restaurant, where for eighteen cents each of the boys got a breakfast, which to their not very fastidious tastes proved very satisfactory. \"There,\" said Ben, with a sigh of satisfaction, as they rose from the table, \"now I feel like work; I\u0027ll pay up that money afore night.\" \"All right,\" said Mark. \"What are you goin\u0027 to do?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mark, irresolutely. \"You\u0027re a match boy,—aint you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where\u0027s your matches?\" \"In Mother Watson\u0027s room.\" \"You might go and get \u0027em when she\u0027s out.\" \"No,\" said Mark, shaking his head. \"I won\u0027t do that.\" \"Why not? You aint afraid to go round there,—be you?\" \"It isn\u0027t that,—but the matches are hers, not mine.\" \"What\u0027s the odds?\" \"I won\u0027t take anything of hers.\" \"Well, you can buy some of your own, then. You\u0027ve got money enough.\" \"So I will,\" said Mark. \"It\u0027s lucky that money came to me in my sleep.\" \"That\u0027s a lucky boat. I guess I\u0027ll go there and sleep to-night.\" Mark did as he proposed. With the money he had he was able to purchase a good supply of matches, and when it became light enough he began to vend them. Hitherto he had not been very fortunate in the disposal of his wares, being timid and bashful; but then he was working for Mother Watson, and expected to derive very little advantage for himself from his labors. Now he was working for himself, and this seemed to put new spirit and courage into him. Then again he felt that he had shaken off the hateful thraldom in which Mother Watson had held him, and this gave him a hopefulness which he had not before possessed. The consequence was that at noon he found that he had earned forty cents in addition to his investment. At that time, too, Ben was ready to pay him his loan, so that Mark found himself twenty-two cents better off than he had been in the morning, having a capital of a dollar and thirty cents, out of which, however, he must purchase his dinner. While he is getting on in such an encouraging manner we must go back to Mother Watson. When Mark did not return the night before she grumbled considerably, but no thought of his intentional desertion dawned upon her. Indeed, she counted upon his timidity and lack of courage, knowing well that a more spirited boy would have broken her chain long before. She only thought, therefore, that he had not got the twenty-five cents, and did not dare to come back, especially as she had forbidden him to do so. So, determining to give him a taste of the leather strap in the morning, she went to bed, first taking a fresh potation from the whiskey bottle, which was her constant companion. Late in the morning Mother Watson woke, feeling as usual, at that hour of the day, cross and uncomfortable, and with a strong desire to make some one else uncomfortable. But Mark, whom she usually made to bear the burden of her temper, was still away. For the first time the old woman began to feel a little apprehensive that he had deserted her. This was far from suiting her, as she found his earnings very convenient, and found it besides pleasant to have somebody to scold. She hastily dressed, without paying much attention to her toilet. Indeed, to do Mother Watson justice, her mind was far from being filled with the vanity of dress, and if she erred on that subject it was in the opposite extreme. When her simple toilet was accomplished she went downstairs, and knocked at Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s door. \"Come in!\" said a hearty voice. Mrs. Flanagan was hard at work at her wash-tub, and had been for a good couple of hours. She raised her good-natured face as the old woman entered. \"The top of the morning to you, Mother Watson,\" she said. \"I hope you\u0027re in fine health this morning, mum.\" \"Then you\u0027ll be disappointed,\" said Mrs. Watson. \"I\u0027ve got a bad feeling at my stomach, and have it most every morning.\" \"It\u0027s the whiskey,\" thought Mrs. Flanagan; but she thought it best not to intimate as much, as it might lead to hostilities. \"Better take a cup of tea,\" said she. \"I haven\u0027t got any,\" said the old woman. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind a sup if you\u0027ve got some handy.\" \"Sit down then,\" said Mrs. Flanagan, hospitably. \"I\u0027ve got some left from breakfast, only it\u0027s cold, but if you\u0027ll wait a bit, I\u0027ll warm it over for you.\" Nothing loth, Mother Watson sank into a chair, and began to give a full account of her ailments to her neighbor, who tried hard to sympathize with her, though, knowing the cause of the ailments, she found this rather difficult. \"Have you seen anything of my boy this morning?\" she asked after a while. \"What, Mark?\" said Mrs. Flanagan. \"Didn\u0027t he come home last night?\" \"No,\" said the old woman, \"and he isn\u0027t home yet. When he does come I\u0027ll give him a dose of the strap. He\u0027s a bad, lazy, shiftless boy, and worries my life out.\" \"You\u0027re hard on the poor boy, Mother Watson. You must remember he\u0027s but a wisp of a lad, and hasn\u0027t much strength.\" \"He\u0027s strong enough,\" muttered Mother Watson. \"It\u0027s lazy he is. Just let him come home, that\u0027s all!\" \"You told him not to come home unless he had twenty-five cents to bring with him.\" \"So I did, and why didn\u0027t he do it?\" \"He couldn\u0027t get the money, it\u0027s likely, and he\u0027s afraid of bein\u0027 bate.\" \"Well, he will be bate then, Mrs. Flanagan, you may be sure of that,\" said the old woman, diving her hand into her pocket to see that the strap was safe. \"Then you\u0027re a bad, cruel woman, to bate that poor motherless child,\" said Mrs. Flanagan, with spirit. \"Say that again, Mrs. Flanagan,\" ejaculated Mother Watson, irefully. \"My hearin\u0027 isn\u0027t as good as it was, and maybe I didn\u0027t hear you right.\" \"No wonder your hearin\u0027 isn\u0027t good,\" said Mrs. Flanagan, who now broke bounds completely. \"I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d have any sense left with the whiskey you drink.\" \"Perhaps you mean to insult me,\" said the old woman, glaring at her hostess with one of the frowns which used to send terror to the heart of poor Mark. \"Take it as you please, mum,\" said Mrs. Flanagan, intrepidly. \"I\u0027m entirely willin\u0027. I\u0027ve been wanting to spake my mind a long while, and now I\u0027ve spoke it.\" Mother Watson clutched the end of the strap in her pocket, and eyed her hostess with a half wish that it would do to treat her as she had treated Mark so often; but Mrs. Flanagan with her strong arms and sturdy frame looked like an antagonist not very easily overcome, and Mrs. Watson forbore, though unwillingly. Meanwhile the tea was beginning to emit quite a savory odor, and the wily old woman thought it best to change her tactics. Accordingly she burst into tears, and, rocking backward and forward, declared that she was a miserable old woman, and hadn\u0027t a friend in the world, and succeeded in getting up such a display of misery that the soft heart of Mrs. Flanagan was touched, and she apologized for the unpleasant personal observations she had made, and hoped Mother Watson would take the tea. To this Mother Watson finally agreed, and intimating that she was faint, Mrs. Flanagan made some toast for her, of which the cunning old woman partook with exceeding relish, notwithstanding her state of unhappiness. \"Come in any time, Mother Watson,\" said Mrs. Flanagan, \"when you want a sip of tea, and I\u0027ll be glad to have you take some with me.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Flanagan; maybe I\u0027ll look in once in a while. A sip of tea goes to the right spot when I feel bad at my stomach.\" \"Must you be goin\u0027, Mother Watson?\" \"Yes,\" said the old woman; \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out on a little walk, to see my sister that keeps a candy-stand by the Park railins. If Mark comes in, will you tell him he\u0027ll find the matches upstairs?\" This Mrs. Flanagan promised to do, and the old woman went downstairs, and into the street. But she had not stated her object quite correctly. It was true that she had a sister, who was in the confectionery and apple line, presiding over one of the stalls beside the Park railings. But the two sisters were not on very good terms, chiefly because the candy merchant, who was more industrious and correct in her habits than her sister, declined to lend money to Mother Watson,—a refusal which led to a perfect coolness between them. It was not therefore to see her that the old woman went out. She wanted to find Mark. She did not mean to lose her hold upon him, if there was any chance of retaining it, and she therefore made up her mind to visit the places where he was commonly to be found, and, when found, to bring him home, by violence, if necessary. So with an old plaid cloak depending from her broad shoulders, and her hand grasping the strap in her pocket, she made her way to the square, peering about on all sides with her ferret-like eyes in the hope of discovering the missing boy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82468.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
