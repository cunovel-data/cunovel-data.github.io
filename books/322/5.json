{"id":20580,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV. A DIFFICULT COMMISSION.","content":"It need hardly be said that Fosdick was punctual to his appointment at the Astor House on the following day. He found Mr. Bates in the reading-room, looking over a Milwaukie paper. \"Good-morning, Mr. Fosdick,\" he said, extending his hand. \"I suppose your time is limited, therefore it will be best for us to go at once to the bank.\" \"You are very kind, sir, to take so much trouble on my account,\" said Fosdick. \"We ought all to help each other,\" said Mr. Bates. \"I believe in that doctrine, though I have not always lived up to it. On second thoughts,\" he added, as they got out in front of the hotel, \"if you approve of my suggestions about the purchase of bank shares, it may not be necessary to go to the bank, as you can take this cheque in payment.\" \"Just as you think best, sir. I can depend upon your judgment, as you know much more of such things than I.\" \"Then we will go at once to the office of Mr. Ferguson, a Wall Street broker, and an old friend of mine. There we will give an order for some bank shares.\" Together the two walked down Broadway until they reached Trinity Church, which fronts the entrance to Wall Street. Here then they crossed the street, and soon reached the office of Mr. Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson, a pleasant-looking man with sandy hair and whiskers, came forward and shook Mr. Bates cordially by the hand. \"Glad to see you, Mr. Bates,\" he said. \"Where have you been for the last four years?\" \"In Milwaukie. I see you are at the old place.\" \"Yes, plodding along as usual. How do you like the West?\" \"I have found it a good place for business, though I am not sure whether I like it as well to live in as New York.\" \"Shan\u0027t you come back to New York some time?\" Mr. Bates shook his head. \"My business ties me to Milwaukie,\" he said. \"I doubt if I ever return.\" \"Who is this young man?\" said the broker, looking at Fosdick. \"He is not a son of yours I think?\" \"No; I am not fortunate enough to have a son. He is a young friend who wants a little business done in your line and, I have accordingly brought him to you.\" \"We will do our best for him. What is it?\" \"He wants to purchase twenty shares in some good city bank. I used to know all about such matters when I lived in the city, but I am out of the way of such knowledge now.\" \"Twenty shares, you said?\" \"Yes.\" \"It happens quite oddly that a party brought in only fifteen minutes since twenty shares in the —— Bank to dispose of. It is a good bank, and I don\u0027t know that he can do any better than take them.\" \"Yes, it is a good bank. What interest does it pay now?\" \"Eight per cent.\"[2] \"That is good. What is the market value of the stock?\" \"It is selling this morning at one hundred and twenty.\" \"Twenty shares then will amount to twenty-four hundred dollars.\" \"Precisely.\" \"Well, perhaps we had better take them. What do you say, Mr. Fosdick?\" \"If you advise it, sir, I shall be very glad to do so.\" \"Then the business can be accomplished at once, as the party left us his signature, authorizing the transfer.\" The transfer was rapidly effected. The broker\u0027s commission of twenty-five cents per share amounted to five dollars. It was found on paying this, added to the purchase money, that one hundred and nineteen dollars remained,—the cheque being for two thousand five hundred and twenty-four dollars. The broker took the cheque, and returned this sum, which Mr. Bates handed to Fosdick. \"You may need this for a reserve fund,\" he said, \"to draw upon if needful until your dividend comes due. The bank shares will pay you probably one hundred and sixty dollars per year.\" \"One hundred and sixty dollars!\" repeated Fosdick, in surprise. \"That is a little more than three dollars a week.\" \"Yes.\" \"It will be very acceptable, as my salary at the store is not enough to pay my expenses.\" \"I would advise you not to break in upon your capital if you can avoid it,\" said Mr. Bates. \"By and by, if your salary increases, you may be able to add the interest yearly to the principal, so that it may be accumulating till you are a man, when you may find it of use in setting you up in business.\" \"Yes, sir; I will remember that. But I can hardly realize that I am really the owner of twenty bank shares.\" \"No doubt it seems sudden to you. Don\u0027t let it make you extravagant. Most boys of your age would need a guardian, but you have had so much experience in taking care of yourself, that I think you can get along without one.\" \"I have my friend Dick to advise me,\" said Fosdick. \"Mr. Hunter seems quite a remarkable young man,\" said Mr. Bates. \"I can hardly believe that his past history has been as he gave it.\" \"It is strictly true, sir. Three years ago he could not read or write.\" \"If he continues to display the same energy, I can predict for him a prominent position in the future.\" \"I am glad to hear you say so, sir. Dick is a very dear friend of mine.\" \"Now, Mr. Fosdick, it is time you were thinking of dinner. I believe this is your dinner hour?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And it is nearly over. You must be my guest to-day. I know of a quiet little lunch room near by, which I used to frequent some years ago when I was in business on this street. We will drop in there and I think you will be able to get through in time.\" Fosdick could not well decline the invitation, but accompanied Mr. Bates to the place referred to, where he had a better meal than he was accustomed to. It was finished in time, for as the clock on the city hall struck one, he reached the door of Henderson\u0027s store. Fosdick could not very well banish from his mind the thoughts of his extraordinary change of fortune, and I am obliged to confess that he did not discharge his duties quite as faithfully as usual that afternoon. I will mention one rather amusing instance of his preoccupation of mind. A lady entered the store, leading by the hand her son Edwin, a little boy of seven. \"Have you any hats that will fit my little boy?\" she said. \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" said Fosdick, absently, and brought forward a large-sized man\u0027s hat, of the kind popularly known as \"stove-pipe.\" \"How will this do?\" asked Fosdick. \"I don\u0027t want to wear such an ugly hat as that,\" said Edwin, in dismay. The lady looked at Fosdick as if she had very strong doubts of his sanity. He saw his mistake, and, coloring deeply, said, in a hurried tone, \"Excuse me; I was thinking of something else.\" The next selection proved more satisfactory, and Edwin went out of the store feeling quite proud of his new hat. Towards the close of the afternoon, Fosdick was surprised at the entrance of Mr. Bates. He came up to the counter where he was standing, and said, \"I am glad I have found you in. I was not quite sure if this was the place where you were employed.\" \"I am glad to see you, sir,\" said Fosdick. \"I have just received a telegram from Milwaukie,\" said Mr. Bates, \"summoning me home immediately on matters connected with business. I shall not therefore be able to remain here to follow up the search upon which I had entered. As you and your friend have kindly offered your assistance, I am going to leave the matter in your hands, and will authorize you to incur any expenses you may deem advisable, and I will gladly reimburse you whether you succeed or not.\" Fosdick assured him that they would spare no efforts, and Mr. Bates, after briefly thanking him, and giving him his address, hurried away, as he had determined to start on his return home that very night.
