{"id":20577,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I. RICHARD HUNTER AT HOME.","content":"\"Fosdick,\" said Richard Hunter, \"what was the name of that man who owed your father two thousand dollars, which he never paid him?\" \"Hiram Bates,\" answered Fosdick, in some surprise. \"What made you think of him?\" \"I thought I remembered the name. He moved out West, didn\u0027t he?\" \"So I heard at the time.\" \"Do you happen to remember where? Out West is a very large place.\" \"I do not know exactly, but I think it was Milwaukie.\" \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Richard Hunter, in visible excitement. \"Well, Fosdick, why don\u0027t you try to get the debt paid?\" \"Of what use would it be? How do I know he is living in Milkwaukie now? If I should write him a letter, there isn\u0027t much chance of my ever getting an answer.\" \"Call and see him.\" \"What, go out to Milwaukie on such a wild-goose chase as that? I can\u0027t think what you are driving at, Dick.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you, Fosdick. Hiram Bates is now in New York.\" \"How do you know?\" asked Fosdick, with an expression of mingled amazement and incredulity. \"I\u0027ll show you.\" Richard Hunter pointed to the list of hotel arrivals in the \"Evening Express,\" which he held in his hand. Among the arrivals at the Astor House occurred the name of Hiram Bates, from Milwaukie. \"If I am not mistaken,\" he said, \"that is the name of your father\u0027s debtor.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you are right,\" said Fosdick, thoughtfully. \"He must be prosperous if he stops at a high-priced hotel like the Astor.\" \"Yes, I suppose so. How much good that money would have done my poor father,\" he added, with a sigh. \"How much good it will do you, Fosdick.\" Fosdick shook his head. \"I would sell out my chance of getting it for ten dollars,\" he said. \"I would buy it at that price if I wanted to make money out of you; but I don\u0027t. I advise you to attend to this matter at once.\" \"What can I do?\" asked Fosdick, who seemed at a loss to understand his companion\u0027s meaning. \"There is only one thing to do,\" said Dick, promptly. \"Call on Mr. Bates this evening at the hotel. Tell him who you are, and hint that you should like the money.\" \"I haven\u0027t got your confidence, Dick. I shouldn\u0027t know how to go about it. Do you really think it would do any good? He might think I was impertinent.\" \"Impertinent to ask payment of a just debt! I don\u0027t see it in that light. I think I shall have to go with you.\" \"I wish you would,—that is, if you really think there is any use in going.\" \"You mustn\u0027t be so bashful if you want to get on in the world, Fosdick. As long as there\u0027s a chance of getting even a part of it, I advise you to make the attempt.\" \"Well, Dick, I\u0027ll be guided by your advice.\" \"Two thousand dollars would be a pretty good windfall for you.\" \"That\u0027s true enough, considering that I only get eight dollars a week.\" \"I wish you got more.\" \"So do I, for one particular reason.\" \"What is that?\" \"I don\u0027t feel satisfied to have you pay ten dollars a week towards our board, while I pay only six.\" \"Didn\u0027t you promise not to say anything more about that?\" said Dick, reproachfully. \"But I can\u0027t help thinking about it. If we had stayed at our old boarding-house in Bleecker Street, I could have paid my full share.\" \"But this is a nicer room.\" \"Much nicer. If I only paid my half, I should be glad of the chance.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll promise you one thing. If Mr. Bates pays you the two thousand dollars, you may pay your half of the expense.\" \"Not much chance of that, Dick.\" \"We can tell better after calling at the Astor House. Get on your coat and we\u0027ll start.\" While the boys,—for the elder of the two is but eighteen—are making preparations to go out, a few explanations may be required by the reader. Those who have read \"Ragged Dick\" and \"Fame and Fortune,\"—the preceding volumes of this series,—will understand that less than three years before Richard Hunter was an ignorant and ragged boot-black about the streets, and Fosdick, though possessing a better education, was in the same business. By a series of upward steps, partly due to good fortune, but largely to his own determination to improve, and hopeful energy, Dick had now become a book-keeper in the establishment of Rockwell \u0026 Cooper, on Pearl Street, and possessed the confidence and good wishes of the firm in a high degree. Fosdick was two years younger, and, though an excellent boy, was less confident, and not so well fitted as his friend to contend with the difficulties of life, and fight his way upward. He was employed in Henderson\u0027s hat and cap store on Broadway, and was at present earning a salary of eight dollars a week. As the two paid sixteen dollars weekly for their board, Fosdick would have had nothing left if he had paid his full share. But Richard Hunter at first insisted on paying eleven dollars out of the sixteen, leaving his friend but five to pay. To this Fosdick would not agree, and was with difficulty prevailed upon at last to allow Richard to pay ten; but he had always felt a delicacy about this, although he well knew how gladly his friend did it. The room which they now occupied was situated in St. Mark\u0027s Place, which forms the eastern portion of Eighth Street. It was a front room on the third floor, and was handsomely furnished. There was a thick carpet, of tasteful figure, on the floor. Between the two front windows was a handsome bureau, surmounted by a large mirror. There was a comfortable sofa, chairs covered with hair-cloth, a centre-table covered with books, crimson curtains, which gave a warm and cosey look to the room when lighted up in the evening, and all the accessories of a well-furnished room which is used at the same time as parlor and chamber. This, with an excellent table, afforded a very agreeable home to the boys,—a home which, in these days, would cost considerably more, but for which, at the time of which I write, sixteen dollars was a fair price. It may be thought that, considering how recently Richard Hunter had been a ragged boot-black, content to sleep in boxes and sheltered doorways, and live at the cheapest restaurants, he had become very luxurious in his tastes. Why did he not get a cheaper boarding-place, and save up the difference in price? No doubt this consideration will readily suggest itself to the minds of some of my young readers. As Richard Hunter had a philosophy of his own on this subject, I may as well explain it here. He had observed that those young men who out of economy contented themselves with small and cheerless rooms, in which there was no provision for a fire, were driven in the evening to the streets, theatres, and hotels, for the comfort which they could not find at home. Here they felt obliged to spend money to an extent of which they probably were not themselves fully aware; and in the end wasted considerably more than the two or three dollars a week extra which would have provided them with a comfortable home. But this was not all. In the roamings spent outside many laid the foundation of wrong habits, which eventually led to ruin or shortened their lives. They lost all the chances of improvement which they might have secured by study at home in the long winter evenings, and which in the end might have qualified them for posts of higher responsibility, and with a larger compensation. Richard Hunter was ambitious. He wanted to rise to an honorable place in the community, and he meant to earn it by hard study. So Fosdick and he were in the habit of spending a portion of every evening in improving reading or study. Occasionally he went to some place of amusement, but he enjoyed thoroughly the many evenings when, before a cheerful fire, with books in their hands, his room-mate and himself were adding to their stock of knowledge. The boys had for over a year taken lessons in French and mathematics, and were now able to read the French language with considerable ease. \"What\u0027s the use of moping every evening in your room?\" asked a young clerk who occupied a hall bedroom adjoining. \"I don\u0027t call it moping. I enjoy it,\" was the reply. \"You don\u0027t go to a place of amusement once a month.\" \"I go as often as I like.\" \"Well, you\u0027re a queer chap. You pay such a thundering price for board. You could go to the theatre four times a week without its costing you any more, if you would take a room like mine.\" \"I know it; but I\u0027d rather have a nice, comfortable room to come home to.\" \"Are you studying for a college professor?\" asked the other, with a sneer. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Dick, good-humoredly; \"but I\u0027m open to proposals, as the oyster remarked. If you know any first-class institution that would like a dignified professor, of extensive acquirements, just mention me, will you?\" So Richard Hunter kept on his way, indifferent to the criticisms which his conduct excited in the minds of young men of his own age. He looked farther than they, and knew that if he wanted to succeed in life, and win the respect of his fellow-men, he must do something else than attend theatres, and spend his evenings in billiard saloons. Fosdick, who was a quiet, studious boy, fully agreed with his friend in his views of life, and by his companionship did much to strengthen and confirm Richard in his resolution. He was less ambitious than Dick, and perhaps loved study more for its own sake. With these explanations we shall now be able to start fairly in our story.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82459.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
