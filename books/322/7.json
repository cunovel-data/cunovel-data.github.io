{"id":20582,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. BEN GIBSON.","content":"But it was not so much the storm or the cold weather that Mark cared for. He had become used to these, so far as one can become used to what is very disagreeable. If after a hard day\u0027s work he had had a good home to come back to, or a kind and sympathizing friend, he would have had that thought to cheer him up. But Mother Watson cared nothing for him, except for the money he brought her, and Mark found it impossible either to cherish love or respect for the coarse woman whom he generally found more or less affected by whiskey. Dick as a Philanthropist. Cold and hungry as he had been oftentimes, he had always shrunk from begging. It seemed to lower him in his own thoughts to ask charity of others. Mother Watson had suggested it to him once or twice, but had never actually commanded it before. Now he was required to bring home twenty-five cents. He knew very well what would be the result if he failed to do this. Mother Watson would apply the leather strap with merciless fury, and he knew that his strength was as nothing compared to hers. So, for the first time in his life, he felt that he must make up his mind to beg. He retraced his steps to the head of Frankfort Street, and walked slowly down Nassau Street. The rain was falling, as I have said, and those who could remained under shelter. Besides, business hours were over. The thousands who during the day made the lower part of the city a busy hive had gone to their homes in the upper portion of the island, or across the river to Brooklyn or the towns on the Jersey shore. So, however willing he might be to beg, there did not seem to be much chance at present. The rain increased, and Mark in his thin clothes was soon drenched to the skin. He felt damp, cold, and uncomfortable. But there was no rest for him. The only home he had was shut to him, unless he should bring home twenty-five cents, and of this there seemed very little prospect. At the corner of Fulton Street he fell in with a boy of twelve, short and sturdy in frame, dressed in a coat whose tails nearly reached the sidewalk. Though scarcely in the fashion, it was warmer than Mark\u0027s, and the proprietor troubled himself very little about the looks. This boy, whom Mark recognized as Ben Gibson, had a clay pipe in his mouth, which he seemed to be smoking with evident enjoyment. \"Where you goin\u0027?\" he asked, halting in front of Mark. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mark. \"Don\u0027t know!\" repeated Ben, taking his pipe from his mouth, and spitting. \"Where\u0027s your matches?\" \"I left them at home.\" \"Then what\u0027d did you come out for in this storm?\" \"The woman I live with won\u0027t let me come home till I\u0027ve brought her twenty-five cents.\" \"How\u0027d you expect to get it?\" \"She wants me to beg.\" \"That\u0027s a good way,\" said Ben, approvingly; \"when you get hold of a soft chap, or a lady, them\u0027s the ones to shell out.\" \"I don\u0027t like it,\" said Mark. \"I don\u0027t want people to think me a beggar.\" \"What\u0027s the odds?\" said Ben, philosophically. \"You\u0027re just the chap to make a good beggar.\" \"What do you mean by that, Ben?\" said Mark, who was far from considering this much of a compliment. \"Why you\u0027re a thin, pale little chap, that people will pity easy. Now I aint the right cut for a beggar. I tried it once, but it was no go.\" \"Why not?\" asked Mark, who began to be interested in spite of himself. \"You see,\" said Ben, again puffing out a volume of smoke, \"I look too tough, as if I could take care of myself. People don\u0027t pity me. I tried it one night when I was hard up. I hadn\u0027t got but six cents, and I wanted to go to the Old Bowery bad. So I went up to a gent as was comin\u0027 up Wall Street from the Ferry, and said, \u0027Won\u0027t you give a poor boy a few pennies to save him from starvin\u0027?\u0027\" \"\u0027So you\u0027re almost starvin\u0027, are you, my lad?\u0027\" says he. \"\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 says I, as faint as I could. \"\u0027Well, starvin\u0027 seems to agree with you,\u0027 says he, laughin\u0027. \u0027You\u0027re the healthiest-lookin\u0027 beggar I\u0027ve seen in a good while.\u0027 \"I tried it again on another gent, and he told me he guessed I was lazy; that a good stout boy like me ought to work. So I didn\u0027t make much beggin\u0027, and had to give up goin\u0027 to the Old Bowery that night, which I was precious sorry for, for there was a great benefit that evenin\u0027. Been there often?\" \"No, I never went.\" \"Never went to the Old Bowery!\" ejaculated Ben, whistling in his amazement. \"Where were you raised, I\u0027d like to know? I should think you was a country greeny, I should.\" \"I never had a chance,\" said Mark, who began to feel a little ashamed of the confession. \"Won\u0027t your old woman let you go?\" \"I never have any money to go.\" \"If I was flush I\u0027d take you myself. It\u0027s only fifteen cents,\" said Ben. \"But I haven\u0027t got money enough only for one ticket. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to-night.\" \"Are you?\" asked Mark, a little enviously. \"Yes, it\u0027s a good way to pass a rainy evenin\u0027. You\u0027ve got a warm room to be in, let alone the play, which is splendid. Now, if you could only beg fifteen cents from some charitable cove, you might go along of me.\" \"If I get any money I\u0027ve got to carry it home.\" \"Suppose you don\u0027t, will the old woman cut up rough?\" \"She\u0027ll beat me with a strap,\" said Mark, shuddering. \"What makes you let her do it?\" demanded Ben, rather disdainfully. \"I can\u0027t help it.\" \"She wouldn\u0027t beat me,\" said Ben, decidedly. \"What would you do?\" asked Mark, with interest. \"What would I do?\" retorted Ben. \"I\u0027d kick, and bite, and give her one for herself between the eyes. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do. She\u0027d find me a hard case, I reckon.\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be any use for me to try that,\" said Mark. \"She\u0027s too strong.\" \"It don\u0027t take much to handle you,\" said Ben, taking a critical survey of the physical points of Mark. \"You\u0027re most light enough to blow away.\" \"I\u0027m only ten years old,\" said Mark, apologetically. \"I shall be bigger some time.\" \"Maybe,\" said Ben, dubiously; \"but you don\u0027t look as if you\u0027d ever be tough like me.\" \"There,\" he added, after a pause, \"I\u0027ve smoked all my \u0027baccy. I wish I\u0027d got some more.\" \"Do you like to smoke?\" asked Mark. \"It warms a feller up,\" said Ben. \"It\u0027s jest the thing for a cold, wet day like this. Didn\u0027t you ever try it?\" \"No.\" \"If I\u0027d got some \u0027baccy here, I\u0027d give you a whiff; but I think it would make you sick the first time.\" \"I don\u0027t think I should like it,\" said Mark, who had never felt any desire to smoke, though he knew plenty of boys who indulged in the habit. \"That\u0027s because you don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it,\" remarked Ben. \"I didn\u0027t like it at first till I got learned.\" \"Do you smoke often?\" \"Every day after I get through blackin\u0027 boots; that is, when I aint hard up, and can\u0027t raise the stamps to pay for the \u0027baccy. But I guess I\u0027ll be goin\u0027 up to the Old Bowery. It\u0027s most time for the doors to open. Where you goin\u0027?\" \"I don\u0027t know where to go,\" said Mark, helplessly. \"I\u0027ll tell you where you\u0027d better go. You won\u0027 find nobody round here. Besides it aint comfortable lettin\u0027 the rain fall on you and wet you through.\" (While this conversation was going on, the boys had sheltered themselves in a doorway.) \"Just you go down to Fulton Market. There you\u0027ll be out of the wet, and you\u0027ll see plenty of people passin\u0027 through when the boats come in. Maybe some of \u0027em will give you somethin\u0027. Then ag\u0027in, there\u0027s the boats. Some nights I sleep aboard the boats.\" \"You do? Will they let you?\" \"They don\u0027t notice. I just pay my two cents, and go aboard, and snuggle up in a corner and go to sleep. So I ride to Brooklyn and back all night. That\u0027s cheaper\u0027n the Newsboys\u0027 Lodgin\u0027 House, for it only costs two cents. One night a gentleman came to me, and woke me up, and said, \u0027We\u0027ve got to Brooklyn, my lad. If you don\u0027t get up they\u0027ll carry you back again.\u0027 \"I jumped up and told him I was much obliged, as I didn\u0027t know what my family would say if I didn\u0027t get home by eleven o\u0027clock. Then, just as soon as his back was turned, I sat down again and went to sleep. It aint so bad sleepin\u0027 aboard the boat, \u0027specially in a cold night. They keep the cabin warm, and though the seat isn\u0027t partic\u0027larly soft its better\u0027n bein\u0027 out in the street. If you don\u0027t get your twenty-five cents, and are afraid of a lickin\u0027, you\u0027d better sleep aboard the boat.\" \"Perhaps I will,\" said Mark, to whom the idea was not unwelcome, for it would at all events save him for that night from the beating which would be his portion if he came home without the required sum. \"Well, good-night,\" said Ben; \"I\u0027ll be goin\u0027 along.\" \"Good-night, Ben,\" said Mark, \"I guess I\u0027ll go to Fulton Market.\" Accordingly Mark turned down Fulton Street, while Ben steered in the direction of Chatham Street, through which it was necessary to pass in order to reach the theatre, which is situated on the Bowery, not far from its junction with Chatham Street. Ben Gibson is a type of a numerous class of improvident boys, who live on from day to day, careless of appearances, spending their evenings where they can, at the theatre when their means admit, and sometimes at gambling saloons. Not naturally bad, they drift into bad habits from the force of outward circumstances. They early learn to smoke or chew, finding in tobacco some comfort during the cold and wet days, either ignorant of or indifferent to the harm which the insidious weed will do to their constitutions. So their growth is checked, or their blood is impoverished, as is shown by their pale faces. As for Ben, he was gifted with a sturdy frame and an excellent constitution, and appeared as yet to exhibit none of the baneful effects of this habit. But no growing boy can smoke without ultimately being affected by it, and such will no doubt be the case with Ben. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82464.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
