{"id":20595,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. RICHARD HUNTER IS PROMOTED.","content":"It was with eager impatience that Mark awaited the return of Richard Hunter, to communicate to him his good luck in securing a place. The thought that he had secured it by his own exertions gave him great satisfaction. \"I\u0027ve got a place,\" were his first words, as Richard entered the house. \"Already?\" asked Richard Hunter. \"You have been quite smart, Mark. How did you manage to obtain it?\" Mark gave the particulars, which need not be repeated. \"What kind of a store is it?\" \"A bookstore.\" \"What is the name of your employer?\" \"Baker.\" \"Baker\u0027s bookstore!\" repeated Richard, turning to Fosdick. \"That is where our particular friend, Roswell Crawford, is employed.\" \"Yes,\" said Mark; \"there\u0027s a boy there about sixteen or seventeen. I believe that is his name.\" \"I am not sure whether his being there will make it pleasant to you. Does he know that you are a friend of mine?\" \"Yes,\" said Mark; \"he inquired particularly about you, Mr. Hunter.\" \"He\u0027s very fond of me,\" said Dick; \"I suppose he sent me his love.\" \"No,\" said Mark, smiling; \"he didn\u0027t speak as if he loved you very much.\" \"He doesn\u0027t like me very much. I am afraid when he gets to be president I shan\u0027t stand much chance of an office. He didn\u0027t try to bully you,—did he?\" \"He said he could get me sent off if I wasn\u0027t careful to please him.\" \"That sounds like Roswell.\" \"He talked as if he was one of the firm,\" said Mark; \"but when Mr. Baker came in, he began to scold him for not dusting the books. After that I didn\u0027t think so much of what he said.\" \"It\u0027s a way he has,\" said Fosdick. \"He don\u0027t like me much either, as I got a place that he was trying for.\" \"If he bullies you, just let me know,\" said Richard. \"Perhaps I can stop it.\" \"I am not afraid,\" said Mark. \"Mr. Baker is there most of the time, and he wouldn\u0027t dare to bully me before him.\" Sunday morning came,—a day when the noisy streets were hushed, and the hum of business was stilled. Richard Hunter and Fosdick still attended the Sunday school, to which they had now belonged for over two years. They were still members of Mr. Greyson\u0027s class, and were much better informed in religious matters than formerly. Frequently—for they were favorite scholars with Mr. Greyson—he invited them home to dine at his handsome residence. Both boys were now perfectly self-possessed on such occasions. They knew how to behave at the table with perfect decorum, and no one would have judged from their dress, manners, or conversation, that they had not always been accustomed to the same style of living. Mr. and Mrs. Greyson noticed with pleasure the great improvement in their protegés, and always welcomed them with kind hospitality. But there was another member of the family who always looked forward with pleasure to seeing them. This was Ida, now a young lady of thirteen, who had from the first taken an especial fancy to Dick, as she always called him. \"Well, Mark,\" said Richard Hunter, on Sunday morning, \"wouldn\u0027t you like to go to Sunday school with me?\" \"Yes,\" said Mark. \"Mother always wanted me to go to Sunday school, but she was so poor that she could not dress me in suitable clothes.\" \"There is nothing to prevent your going now. We shall be ready in about half an hour.\" At the appointed time the three set out. The distance was not great, the church being situated four blocks farther up town on Fifth Avenue. They chanced to meet Mr. Greyson on the church steps. \"Good-morning, Richard. Good-morning, Henry,\" he said. Then, glancing at Mark, \"Who is your young friend?\" \"His name is Mark Manton,\" said Richard. \"He is my ward.\" \"Indeed! I had not thought of you in the character of a guardian,\" said Mr. Greyson, smiling. \"I should like to have him enter one of the younger classes,\" said Richard. \"Certainly, I will gladly find a place for him. Perhaps you can take him in your class.\" \"In my class!\" repeated Richard, in surprise. \"Yes, I thought I had mentioned to you that Mr. Benton was about to leave the city, and is obliged to give up his class. I would like to have you take it.\" \"But am I qualified to be a teacher?\" asked Richard, who had never before thought of being invited to take a class. \"I think you have excellent qualifications for such a position. It speaks well for you, however, that you should feel a modest hesitation on the subject.\" \"I think Fosdick would make a better teacher than I.\" \"Oh, I intend to draft him into the service also. I shall ask him to take the next vacancy.\" The class assigned to our friend Dick (we are sometimes tempted to call him by his old, familiar name) consisted of boys of from ten to eleven years of age. Among these Mark was placed. Although he had never before attended a Sunday school, his mother, who was an excellent woman, had given him considerable religious instruction, so that he was about as well advanced as the rest of the class. Richard easily adapted himself to the new situation in which he was placed. He illustrated the lesson in a familiar and oftentimes quaint manner, so that he easily commanded the attention of the boys, who were surprised when the time came for the lesson to close. \"I am glad you are my teacher, Mr. Hunter,\" said one of the boys at the close of the service. \"Thank you,\" said Richard, who felt gratified at the compliment. \"It\u0027s new business to me, but I hope I shall be able to interest you.\" \"Won\u0027t you come and dine with us?\" asked Mr. Greyson, as they were leaving the church. Richard Hunter hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know if Mark can find his way home,\" he said with hesitation. \"Yes, I can, Mr. Hunter,\" said Mark. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself about me.\" \"But I mean to have him come too,\" said Mr. Greyson. \"Our table is a large one, as you know, and we can accommodate three as well as two.\" \"Do come, Dick,\" said Ida Greyson. Richard was seldom able to resist a request preferred by Ida, and surrendered at discretion. So, as usual, Fosdick walked on with Mr. Greyson, this time with Mark beside him, while Richard walked with Ida. \"Who is that little boy, Dick?\" asked the young lady. \"That\u0027s my ward, Miss Ida,\" said Richard. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you are his guardian, Dick?\" \"Yes, I believe I am.\" \"Why,\" said the lively young lady, \"I always thought guardians were old, and cross, and bald-headed.\" \"I don\u0027t know but that description will suit me after a while,\" said Dick. \"My hair has been coming out lately.\" \"Has it, really?\" said Ida, who took this seriously. \"I hope you won\u0027t be bald. I don\u0027t think you would look well.\" \"But I might wear a wig.\" \"I don\u0027t like wigs,\" said the young lady, decidedly. \"If you were a lady now, you might wear a cap. How funny you\u0027d look in a cap!\" and she burst out into a peal of merry laughter. \"I think a cap would be more becoming to you,\" said Richard. \"Do you ever scold your ward?\" asked Ida. \"No, he\u0027s a pretty good boy. He don\u0027t need it.\" \"Where did you get acquainted with him? Have you known him long?\" \"He was taken sick at the door of our office one day. So I had him carried to my boarding-place, and took care of him till he got well.\" \"That was very good of you,\" said Ida, approvingly. \"What did he use to do?\" \"He was a match boy.\" \"Does he sell matches now?\" \"No; he has got a place in a bookstore.\" \"What did you say his name was?\" \"Mark.\" \"That\u0027s a pretty good name, but I don\u0027t like it so well as Dick.\" \"Thank you,\" said Richard. \"I am glad you like my name.\" At this moment they were passing the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Standing on the steps were two acquaintances of ours, Roswell Crawford and Ralph Graham. They had cigars in their mouths, and there was a swaggering air about them, which was not likely to prepossess any sensible person in their favor. They had not been to church, but had spent the morning in sauntering about the city, finally bringing up at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where, posting themselves conspicuously on the steps, they watched the people passing by on their way from church. Richard Hunter bowed to Roswell, as it was his rule never to be found wanting in politeness. Roswell was ill-mannered enough not to return the salutation. \"Who is that, Roswell?\" asked Ralph Graham. \"It\u0027s a boot-black,\" said Roswell, sneeringly. \"What do you mean? I am speaking of that nice-looking young fellow that bowed to you just now.\" \"His name is Hunter. He used to be a boot-black, as I told you; but he\u0027s got up in the world, and now he\u0027s putting on airs.\" \"He seems to have got into good company, at any rate. He is walking with the daughter of Mr. Greyson, a rich merchant down town.\" \"He\u0027s got impudence enough for anything,\" said Roswell, with a feeling of bitter envy which he could not conceal. \"It really makes me sick to see him strutting about as if he were a gentleman\u0027s son.\" \"Like you,\" suggested Ralph, slyly; for he had already been informed by Roswell, on various occasions, that he was \"a gentleman\u0027s son.\" \"Yes,\" said Roswell, \"I\u0027m a gentleman\u0027s son, if I\u0027m not so lucky as some people. Did you see that small boy in front?\" \"Walking with Mr. Greyson?\" \"Yes, I suppose so.\" \"What of him?\" \"That\u0027s our errand boy.\" \"Is it?\" asked Ralph, in some surprise. \"He seems to be one of the lucky kind too.\" \"He sold matches about the streets till a few weeks ago,\" said Roswell, spitefully. \"He sold them to some purpose, it seems, for he\u0027s evidently going home to dine with Mr. Greyson.\" \"Mr. Greyson seems to be very fond of low company. That\u0027s all I can say.\" \"When you and I get to be as rich as he is, we can choose our own company.\" \"I hope I shall choose better than he.\" \"Well, let\u0027s drop them,\" said Ralph, who was getting tired of the subject. \"I must be getting home to dinner.\" \"So must I.\" \"Come round to my room, after dinner, and we\u0027ll have another smoke.\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll come round. I suppose mother\u0027ll be wanting me to go to church with her, but I\u0027ve got tired of going to church.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82477.html","bookId":322,"book":{"id":322,"title":"Mark the Match Boy or Richard Hunter\u0027s Ward","description":"简介： Mark, the Match Boy, is the third volume of the Ragged Dick Series, and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special phase of street life in New York.
