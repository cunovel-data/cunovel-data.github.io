Three of her childhood friends have died. The police say they\u0027re suicides, but Isabelle knows they would never, ever take their own lives. Her past binds her to every victim, and she knows it\u0027s only a matter of time before the killer comes after her. Only one man can help her now, the only man she\u0027s ever trusted, the man who saved her so long ago... \\n For Grant Kent, Delta Force vet, just being near Isabelle brings back old memories and desires, and stirs longings he\u0027d rather deny. Yet he can\u0027t ignore the real terror in her eyes, or resist the thought of holding her again. But even as their friendship begins to blossom into a passionate affair, a killer continues his deadly rampage and plots his next move: the \"suicide\" of Isabelle Carson.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/no-escape-delta-force-3.jpg","author":"Shannon K.
