It\u0027s crummy, missing out on fun. But I don\u0027t feel right, dating, under the circumstances. I can\u0027t get up the nerve to tell my parents.\\n\\n March 5th.\\n\\n I stopped to see Dr. Therrian. He had called Terry. He said Terry is sad, scared, and very immature. That it really would be best to give the baby up. I guess until he told me that, I still thought that maybe Terry and I would get married. But I don\u0027t think I wanted to.\\n\\n March 10th.\\n\\n I told Mom and Daddy. They both cried. They got angry. Then they said they loved me and would help me through it.\\n\\n April 30th.\\n\\n One more month of school, and I still don\u0027t show. I think I can make it till school ends, if I wear the right clothes. Dr. Therrian says it\u0027s because I\u0027m tall, that sometimes tall women don\u0027t get all bulky the way others do. The baby is due in September. Mom and Daddy thought I should go away for the summer. I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n May 23rd.\\n\\n I\u0027ve only gained nine pounds. No one knows, except me, Mom and Daddy, Dr. Therrian, and of course, Terry, but I haven\u0027t heard from him at all. Sometimes ... this is weird ... I actually like the feeling of having a baby growing. I can feel it move.\\n\\n June 10th.\\n\\n Thank God school is over. I\u0027m really starting to get big. I\u0027ve decided to stay here for the summer, just at home. Mom and Daddy are going to tell everyone that I\u0027ve gone back to Detroit for the summer, but actually I\u0027m just going to stay here in the house. It\u0027s private. I can sunbathe and stuff, but I won\u0027t have to see people. Doc Therrian says he\u0027ll come to the house now and then for checkups. When I have to go to the hospital, of course, the secret will be blown. The nurses there will probably tell someone. But by then it won\u0027t really matter. Mom and Daddy said I don\u0027t have to go back to school here. I can go away and start all over.\\n\\n June 22nd.\\n\\n Doc Therrian says I\u0027m very, very healthy, that I will have a fine baby. It feels very strong. It kicks against my insides. I wonder if it\u0027s a boy or a girl. Funny, I can barely remember Terry at all. He went out to Colorado to work, this summer, Doc said. I guess that\u0027s best.\\n\\n June 24th.\\n\\n I wonder if I get to name the baby. I hope so. If it\u0027s a girl, I\u0027ll name it Juliet. Sort of after me, but more romantic. I don\u0027t know about a boy. I\u0027d kind of like to name a boy for my father ... but Clement? Ugh. Or for Doc Therrian, who\u0027s been so great ... but Clarence? Double ugh. Well, I\u0027ll just hope it\u0027s a girl. Probably I won\u0027t get to choose the name anyway.\\n\\n July 30th.\\n\\n It\u0027s so hot. And I\u0027m so huge. When my mother looks at me, she cries, sometimes. They\u0027ve enrolled me in a fancy boarding school for next year. Miss Somebody\u0027s.\\n\\n August 1st.\\n\\n Good news! Doc Therrian says they\u0027ve found a terrific family who wants to adopt my baby! They won\u0027t tell me who, of course. In fact, Doc doesn\u0027t know. But it\u0027s being set up with a lawyer, and Doc said that the parents are terrific people, according to the lawyer, and that they can\u0027t have a baby of their own.\\n\\n Later\\n\\n When I wrote that, I thought it was good news. Now, the more I think about it, the more I think I don\u0027t want anyone else to have my baby. It is mine. Maybe there\u0027s some way I could keep it. We\u0027d be just fifteen years apart. It would be like having a brother or a sister.\\n\\n August 8th.\\n\\n It\u0027s weird, being here at the house all summer, with no one knowing. Doc Therrian comes often. He pretends it\u0027s a medical visit ... he always brings his stethoscope ... but mostly we just sit and talk. We both read a lot, and we talk about books. Or just anything. He tells me about when he was a boy, in Simmons\u0027 Mills. Can you imagine living in a place like this, all your life? And we talk about the baby. He says it wouldn\u0027t be fair for me to keep it. Not fair to the baby. Funny, I wasn\u0027t thinking about the baby, just about myself. He\u0027s right, I guess. Those other people are waiting. I wonder if they\u0027ve bought little clothes.\\n\\n August 29th.\\n\\n I feel strange. I keep having pains, and then they turn out to be nothing.\\n\\n September 10th.\\n\\n School started in Simmons\u0027 Mills. What a strange feeling. All the kids think I am off at boarding school. I can see, sometimes, the Hartley twins riding down the hill on their bikes, heading for the high school in the mornings. If their mother knew how fast they go, she\u0027d kill them. Coming home, they have to get off and walk, pushing their bikes. Hah. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to walk up that hill now if you paid me a million dollars.\\n\\n September 13th.\\n\\n I\u0027ve had pains off and on all day. Doc says this is probably it. I\u0027m scared stiff. One thing I made him promise. That they\u0027ll let me see the baby, and hold it, before they take it away.\\n\\n September 15th.\\n\\n It\u0027s a girl a girl a girl a girl! I haven\u0027t seen her yet, but they told me I will. I was asleep when she was born. Doc Therrian gave me something at the hospital, and the last thing I remember is when they were wheeling me down the hall to the delivery room. Mom leaned over and kissed me. Doc was holding my hand and walking beside the stretcher. When I woke up I was thin again, and achy all over, and Doc was there smiling, and said it was a girl, and she\u0027s fine. I\u0027m so tired.\\n\\n September 17th.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care what Doc says, it isn\u0027t fair, it isn\u0027t. I could keep her. I could get a job, and have an apartment somewhere, and earn enough so that we could live.\\n\\n Oh, I know, that\u0027s stupid, but I just feel so sad. This morning a lawyer came, with the papers. I hated him. Doc was there, and my parents, and we all talked, and before I signed my name, the lawyer said several times, \"Now you\u0027re sure this is what you want to do?\" Why did he keep asking? Of course I\u0027m not sure. But in the end I signed where he showed me. Mom and Daddy signed, too. And then Doc attached another sheet of paper that had Terry\u0027s signature, all the way from Colorado. Funny. Terry has never written to me. I wonder if he\u0027s as miserable as I am about this.\\n\\n When they had all left, I cried. After a minute Doc Therrian came back in the room, and he put his arms around me and held me. And he cried, too.\\n\\n September 18th.\\n\\n Tomorrow I\u0027m going home. So is the baby, wherever her home will be. Oh, I hope they have a little cradle ready for her, and a pink blanket, and lots of bright-colored toys. Tomorrow, Doc says, I can see her, to say goodbye.\\n\\n September 19th.\\n\\n I was all dressed, ready to leave, waiting for Mom to come and get me. And the baby was all dressed, too, in clothes that Mom had bought, when they brought her in. They left me alone with her for just a few minutes.\\n\\n She is so beautiful that when I saw her, I cried.\\n\\n Then I didn\u0027t want her to remember me (do they remember, that little? I don\u0027t know) crying, so I smiled at her, and kissed her on the cheek, and said goodbye. I\u0027ll never see her again. I guess the thing I hope most for her is that she\u0027ll be happy, and never know what it\u0027s like to be lonely.\\n\\n 31\\n\\n IT WAS what her mother had written, too, to Tallie. \"She is so beautiful that when I saw her, I wept.\"\\n\\n Do they remember? Julie had asked her diary. No. I don\u0027t remember, Natalie thought. If I could, what would I remember? Being taken from Julie, dressed in the clothes that Julie\u0027s mother had bought, taken by whom? Probably Dr. Therrian—delivered to Foster Goodwin\u0027s office, and picked up there by Mom and Dad. It wasn\u0027t a bad thing. Julie loved me. It was a little-girl, selfish kind of love, the same kind of thing I used to feel for my favorite toys, so that I wouldn\u0027t share them with Nancy; or like what I felt for that kitten I had once. I was jealous when it purred and butted against someone else, wanting to be petted; it seemed so important that it be only mine. But Julie did love me.\\n\\n And my parents loved me then, even on that first day when they drove that long road to a strange place to bring me home. Not in the same way Julie did. \"She will be her own person,\" Mom had written about me to Tallie. Mom and Dad have always loved me that way, so that they always let me purr against other people, didn\u0027t grab me back and say \"She\u0027s ours.\" I never realized it until I read what Julie wrote when I was born; she cried—and what she wrote, finally, was \"the thing I hope most for her is that she\u0027ll be happy\"—but Julie was so young. She really wanted to hold on tight to me, saying \"Mine\" the way a child does to a favorite doll, until the doll, sometimes, is broken. She was just old enough that she realized she had to let go, not old enough to know why. And it was the doctor who helped her do it.\\n\\n Dr. Therrian. I think he loved me, too, when I was born. I wonder why. Dad cares for his patients, many of them in very special ways, but he doesn\u0027t love them the way Dr. Therrian seemed to love Julie and her baby. Because he was lonely, and Julie seemed to be, too?\\n\\n And now he is more alone than he has ever been, dying. Or dead. I should call Anna Talbot and ask about him.\\n\\n George, the green-uniformed doorman, recognized Natalie. \"Another note?\" he asked, smiling at her when she appeared in front of the apartment on 79th Street.\\n\\n \"No,\" she said. \"Mrs. Hutchinson\u0027s expecting me.\"\\n\\n George opened the door to the building, took her to the brass cage of an elevator, and pressed the button for the sixth floor. When the door unfolded itself at six, Natalie found herself in a small foyer with a parquet floor; large plants sat in thick woven baskets in the corners. The only door was massive and dark, with a polished brass knob. Natalie knocked timidly, and it was Julie who answered.\\n\\n She was dressed in spotless white slacks and a bulky white cowl-necked jersey; there was a heavy gold bracelet on her right wrist, and her hair was braided in a thick dark coil that was looped into a knot at her neck. For the second time in two days, Natalie had left the hotel feeling chic and lovely and been transformed into tacky awkwardness when she greeted Julie.\\n\\n \"What a lovely suit,\" Julie said graciously, looking at Natalie\u0027s bright red linen. \"Come in, come in.\"\\n\\n The spacious living room was airy and pale, its walls stark white, the carpet hazy beige, and the few, carefully placed pieces of furniture shades of white, beige, and yellow. On one wall, a lighted painting hung alone; Natalie recognized the ephemeral light and the indistinct brush-strokes of it as an impressionist\u0027s. It fitted with the room. So did Julie. Natalie felt like a bright red blotch; she wished she had worn her yellow dress.\\n\\n \"Sit down.\" Julie smiled, seating herself in front of the small table where tea things were already set out. \"The boys will be in, in a moment. I want you to meet them.\"\\n\\n They appeared in a doorway, silent and shy, two of them dressed identically in blue cotton shorts and striped jerseys. Dark hair. Dark eyes. They didn\u0027t have Julie\u0027s eyes, or Natalie\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Come in, boys, and be polite!\" called Julie. \"Natalie, this is Gareth—\" the older boy came forward and held out his hand to shake Natalie\u0027s—\"and this is Cameron. Cam, take your thumb out.\" The little boy took his thumb from his mouth, and held it, warm and wet, out to Natalie\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" said Natalie, grinning. \"Hi there.\"\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" asked Gareth. Cameron had replaced his thumb.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Natalie. I\u0027m a friend of your mom\u0027s. What are you guys doing this afternoon?\"\\n\\n \"Taking our bikes to the park,\" said Gareth, less shyly. \"I have a new bike, with training wheels. Cam just has a tricycle.\"\\n\\n \"Bet you\u0027re pretty fast on your tricycle, aren\u0027t you, Cam?\" asked Natalie.\\n\\n Cameron smiled behind his thumb and nodded. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/find-a-stranger-say-goodbye/page-20.html","bookId":2710,"book":{"id":2710,"title":"Find a Stranger, Say Goodbye","description":"Storyline: Natalie Armstrong has all a girl could want: beauty and intelligence, a loving family and a great boyfriend.
