He was drinking an orange Gatorade which, I think, was the classic Gatorade. Of course, if I drank Gatorade now, I would heave it up in a glorious orange fountain.\\n\\n Jacky, of course, didn\u0027t need to know that, and since I only spent a few hours a week with the guy - and most of that was spent with him yelling at me to keep my hands up - I hadn\u0027t yet developed a telepathic rapport with him.\\n\\n Which was just as well. I seriously suspected that the old man had suffered some brain damage himself. He\u0027d been a champion back in the day. And in Jacky\u0027s case, \"back in the day\" meant the early fifties in Ireland.\\n\\n Jacky had spent the past few decades here in Fullerton. At one point his gym had been a happening place for up-and-coming boxers, with Jacky himself training a handful of champions. That is, until downtown Fullerton had become so trendy that Jacky - perhaps a better businessman than I\u0027d given him credit for - had decided to turn his gym into a women\u0027s self-defense studio.\\n\\n Then again, if I was a spunky old man, I\u0027d rather train cute women, too.\\n\\n Anyway, when Jacky finished off the Gatorade, he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, dropped the empty bottle into a nearby wastebasket and sat back.\\n\\n \"What did you think of the kid?\" he asked, speaking in an Irish accent so thick that you would think he was only now making his way through Ellis Island.\\n\\n \"I think the kid is deeply troubled,\" I said. \"And I don\u0027t blame him.\"\\n\\n Jacky nodded. He seemed uncomfortable in his office. He seemed less himself, somehow. Out there, in the gym, he was larger than life, even though he was only a few inches taller than me. In here, at day\u0027s end, he looked like a shell of himself. He looked tired. Old. But not weak. Never weak. Even in quiet repose, the man looked like he wanted to punch something.\\n\\n \"Russ isn\u0027t the first lad to kill somebody in the ring, and he won\u0027t be the last. And usually it plays with a fighter\u0027s head, so much so that they ain\u0027t ever much the same again.\"\\n\\n \"He feels guilt,\" I said.\\n\\n \"They all do. Except it\u0027s part of the risk we take. Each kid knows that his next fight might be his last.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you send him to me?\"\\n\\n Jacky didn\u0027t answer immediately. Through his closed door, I could hear someone sweeping and whistling. A door slammed somewhere, and I heard two women giggling down a hallway that I knew led to the female locker rooms.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s part of the risk, yes, but something about this one doesn\u0027t smell right.\"\\n\\n I waited. I wanted to hear it from Jacky, someone who had seen tens of thousands of punches thrown in his lifetime. Jacky rubbed his knuckles as he formulated his thoughts. I wondered how difficult it was for Jacky to formulate his thoughts. How much brain damage had the old Irishman suffered?\\n\\n There had to be some. His aura, which was mostly light blue and ironically serene, appeared bright red around his head. The bright red, I knew, was the body fighting something, perhaps a disease. Or dealing with an injury.\\n\\n The Irishman rubbed his face and seemed to have lost his train of thought. The reddish aura around his head flared briefly.\\n\\n I said gently, \"You were saying something about this fight not smelling right.\"\\n\\n \"Was I now?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Which fight?\"\\n\\n \"Baker vs. Marquez.\"\\n\\n He nodded and rubbed the back of his neck and gritted his teeth. \"It\u0027s hell getting old, Sam.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m told.\"\\n\\n \"And this noggin of mine just ain\u0027t right sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Mine either.\"\\n\\n He nodded, but I wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d heard me. He said, \"Routine fight. No one beating up no one. Judges had Baker up a few rounds, but the truth is, they were only just beginning to feel each other out. No one had taken control yet. It was even as hell.\"\\n\\n \"Were you there?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"At the fight? Hell, no. The wife doesn\u0027t let me anywhere near Vegas these days. She\u0027s afraid I\u0027ll spend our retirement - and then I\u0027ll never get to leave this damn gym.\"\\n\\n \"You love this damn gym,\" I said.\\n\\n He winked at me, and I saw that there were tears in his eyes. Where the tears came from and why, I didn\u0027t exactly know. \"More than anything,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You watched the fight on TV?\"\\n\\n \"Which fight?\"\\n\\n \"Baker vs. Marquez.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course. Russ is a local boy. He trains here sometimes. I showed him my best moves, and he never forgot his roots. Got to love a kid like that.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Damn shame what happened. He ain\u0027t no killer. They were just boxing. Trading jabs, the occasional straight shot or hook. Nothing landed yet. Nothing really. No reason a kid should be dead.\"\\n\\n Jacky fell silent and absently wiped the tears from his eyes. His knuckles were crisscrossed with scar tissue. I imagined Jacky raising hell in the streets of Dublin.\\n\\n \"So, what are you saying, Jacky?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m saying, in one fell swoop, two top contenders have disappeared. One\u0027s dead, and the other might as well be dead. There\u0027s something to that, Sam, something worth looking into.\"\\n\\n I nodded, thinking about that, as Jacky sat back and closed his eyes and rubbed the scar tissue along his knuckles. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-5.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) \\n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
