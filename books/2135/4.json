{"id":94974,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"So, do you still need to sleep during the day?\" Kingsley asked, or, at least, I think he asked. Words had a tendency to get muffled when spoken around a side of beef.\n We were at Mulberry Street Ristorante in downtown Fullerton, sitting by the window, drinking wine and eating steak. Just like regular people.\n Of course, one of us wasn\u0027t so much eating their steak, as slurping the bloody juice pooling around it, and the other wasn\u0027t so much eating his steak, as wolfing it down.\n I nodded. \"I\u0027m still a creature of the night, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking. And, yes, I still need to sleep during the day. I\u0027m still weak during the day. I still feel like crap when I have to get up and pick up the kids during the day. The medallion only gives me the ability to tolerate the sun.\"\n \"No more burning?\" he asked between bites.\n \"No more burning.\"\n Mulberry\u0027s was busy tonight. It was busy every night, as far as I could tell. It was our restaurant of choice, especially since the cooks and waiters here were used to my orders of raw meat, extra bloody.\n Now, as I watched Kingsley tear through his meat in record time, something occurred to me. \"Now I have a question for you.\"\n \"Shoot.\"\n \"Were you always this big?\"\n \"Big...how?\"\n \"Big, as in I\u0027ve actually seen you turn sideways to go through doorways.\"\n \"Only some doors, and, no, the big part came later.\"\n \"How much later?\"\n \"Over time. Decades. Little by little, after each transformation.\"\n \"You mean, you grew after each transformation?\"\n \"Yes. At least, as far as I could tell.\"\n \"But why?\" I asked.\n \"Survival, I think.\"\n \"But you\u0027re already immortal,\" I said, lowering my voice.\n \"A weak immortal doesn\u0027t get one very far, Sam. And remember, I can\u0027t turn into - \" and now he lowered his voice to a low growl - \"the thing I turn into, on cue. That happens only once a month, and generally in a locked room. And when it does happen, I\u0027m often out of my mind. Gone to the world for the whole night.\"\n \"While something else takes over your body.\"\n \"Right,\" he said.\n \"So, being big in your daily life has its benefits.\"\n \"Of course. Stronger, faster, able to protect myself.\"\n \"So how big were you before?\"\n \"Big enough, but not this big.\"\n \"Do all werewolves get as big as you?\"\n \"Some bigger.\"\n I said, \"I haven\u0027t gotten bigger. If anything, I\u0027ve gotten smaller.\"\n \"And you won\u0027t get bigger because each night you\u0027re at full strength. And even during the day you\u0027re not completely incapacitated.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"Even though I feel weaker during the day, I\u0027m still far stronger than I used to be.\"\n I recalled my boxing match with the Marine last year, the match that had occurred just before sundown. Sure, I had felt like crap, but I was still strong enough to take down America\u0027s finest.\n \"Also,\" added Kingsley, reaching over and cutting off a chunk of my nearly raw steak, \"it\u0027s just the nature of my kind.\"\n \"For the host to grow big,\" I said.\n \"Right. We all have our quirks.\"\n \"I think your quirks are better than my quirks,\" I said.\n \"And who among us can fly?\" he asked.\n I thought about that. \"Good point.\"\n As the water refilled our glasses of wine, Kingsley asked what I was working on these days. I told him about my latest case, and as I did so, Kingsley began nodding. Turns out he\u0027d seen the fight live on HBO.\n \"Wasn\u0027t much of a punch,\" he said. \"Not enough to kill a man.\"\n \"Or so we think,\" I said. After all, I had done some research on the subject. \"We still don\u0027t know his condition prior to the fight, or the amount of punches he\u0027d taken in practice and other fights.\"\n Kingsley shrugged. \"True. Either way, it wasn\u0027t much of a punch; in fact, I thought the fight was pretty even up to that point. What\u0027s your gut tell you?\"\n I shrugged too, but, unlike Kingsley, my shrug didn\u0027t look like two land masses heaving. I said, \"Nothing yet, although I think Russell\u0027s grasping at straws.\"\n Kingsley nodded. \"Looking for a way to live with his guilt, perhaps.\"\n \"Perhaps,\" I said. \"One thing is clear: It\u0027s eating him alive. Literally.\" I told Kingsley about the black halo I\u0027d seen around the young boxer.\n \"The same halo you saw around your son?\"\n \"The same.\"\n \"What\u0027s it mean?\" asked Kingsley.\n \"It means he needs help. Lots of help.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-4.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
