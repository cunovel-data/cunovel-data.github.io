{"id":94976,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"You there, Moon Dance? The IM box appeared on my laptop screen as I was packing my bags in my room. I quickly tossed my unfolded sweater in my suitcase. It was only February. Even Vegas was cold in February. To what do I owe the pleasure, Fang? I need to talk to you. In person? Maybe. No. I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s going on, Fang? There was a pause, and I was suddenly alarmed to discover my normally dormant heart had picked up its pace. It thudded steadily against my ribs, rocking me slightly. Normally, my own beating heart went unnoticed, which wasn\u0027t too surprising since these days it generally only beat about five times a minute. Something was wrong. Or something could potentially be wrong. Or something was just...off. For starters, Fang seemed unusually closed to me. Not to mention, he didn\u0027t seem to be picking up on my own increasingly worried thoughts. What the hell was going on? The little pencil icon appeared in the IM box, which meant Fang was typing something. A moment later, his words appeared: I recently...met someone. Would this someone happen to be a female? Yes. This wasn\u0027t horrible news. At least, not for me. I liked Fang. I appreciated his friendship and help. But I had always felt he had an ulterior motive: he wanted something from me. And what he wanted, he had made clear a year ago. He wanted me to turn him. Although I didn\u0027t doubt that he loved me, I always wondered where the love originated. Was it for me, or for what I am? A thought suddenly occurred to me, and I voiced it. Or, rather, wrote it: Is this woman a...vampire? Yes. A real vampire? A real vampire, Moon Dance. May I ask her name? You know her. Something inside me turned to ice, which, for me, is saying something. I exhaled a steady stream of cold air, and wrote: Detective Rachel Hanner. Yes. How did you two meet? She came in the other night, sat at the bar. Ordered a glass of white wine, same as you. I read his words and would have held my breath, except I was never sure when I held my breath these days. He went on: There was something about her. Something...otherworldly. The way she stared at me. Her small, precise movements. Her faint accent. It wasn\u0027t long before I suspected what she was. I waited, re-reading his words, thinking hard, puzzling through this. What did this mean? I didn\u0027t know yet. It wasn\u0027t until later, after her second glass of wine, that I realized she had been reading my mind. Her intrusion wasn\u0027t obvious. Not like the way I know when you\u0027re in there. I mean, I can always feel when you\u0027re in my mind, Moon Dance. Touching down here and there. He paused and I was truly feeling sick. Down the hallway, I heard Anthony snoring lightly. Music came from Tammy\u0027s room. The house was locked. I always kept it locked. What was Hanner up to? I didn\u0027t know, but I had that creepy-ass feeling of being watched. Of course, with me, it might be more than a feeling. I stood and walked over to my main window and looked out into the cul-de-sac. No one was out there. At least, not that I could see. All the cars on the street I recognized. But with Hanner - the only other vampire that I knew personally - she could be anywhere. She could be sitting on my roof, for all I knew. I shivered. Jesus, I thought. I sat back down and Fang\u0027s next message appeared almost instantaneously: I think within a few minutes, she knew all my secrets. All of them. I knew what Fang meant. The man had some killer secrets. Literally. The kind that would send him back to jail - or a mental institution - for the rest of his life. I see, I wrote, mostly to let Fang know I was still here. She showed me her badge and told me she knew who I was. She called me by my name...my real name. She next gave me her home address and told me to meet her there after work. When was this? Last night. \"Shit,\" I whispered. What happened next, Fang? I wondered if Fang knew what had happened. After all, I knew that Hanner had a...gift for removing memories. Indeed, I sensed a lot of vagueness from Fang, and it was clear that our personal connection had been broken, somehow. I thought Hanner had something to do with that. I\u0027m...I\u0027m not really sure, he wrote, confirming my suspicions. I had a vision of blood, a lot of blood. Fang might have been more closed off to me than normal and, although I wasn\u0027t sure what the hell was going on, we still seemed to have some sort of connection. Enough for me to see the blood. But most disturbing of all - I wrote: You drank blood. He paused only slightly before writing: Yes, Moon Dance. I sensed his shame, but I also sensed his excitement. Fang had grown up with elongated canine teeth, a rare defect that had grown into an even rarer psychosis: as a youth, he began to actually believe he was a vampire. Crazy, but that was exactly what it was. Crazy. His psychosis had led to the death of his girlfriend, a teenage girl who had been partially bled to death...and partially consumed. By Fang. His escape from a high-security mental institution had been in all the papers, and his subsequent manhunt had been well documented. But he had slipped away. And assumed a new identity. Aaron Parker, aka Fang, now went by the official name of Eli Roberts - and how he landed in my life was one of coincidence and obsession. Although I doubted he still saw himself as a real vampire, I knew he retained a hunger for blood. I knew this because every now and then I would see it in his thoughts. His hunger. But over the years, he had controlled himself. Controlled it. We were both silent. Or, rather, the IM message box remained silent. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. I sensed that Hanner was working her way into his world, but for what reason, I didn\u0027t know. But one thing I did know: none of it was good. So, what will you do now, Fang? I finally wrote, deciding on the direct path. What else could I say? I don\u0027t know, Moon Dance. Did she threaten you? She didn\u0027t have to. I understand the implications. I\u0027m a fugitive. She\u0027s a cop. Things could go very badly for me. Did she say what she wanted? From me? Not yet. She wants something from you, Fang. I sensed him nodding, and after a moment, he wrote: I know. But I sensed he was holding something back, and finally wrote: There\u0027s something else, isn\u0027t there, Fang? Yes, Moon Dance. I waited, suddenly afraid of the answer. After a moment, he wrote: She wants to give me something, Moon Dance. The one thing you wouldn\u0027t do for me, the one thing you wouldn\u0027t give me. Ah, Fang... Yes, Moon Dance. Immortality.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-6.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
