I nearly ignored it. Nearly. I mean, she was so very close to having this guy in tears.\n Except I knew this was a client at the door. And clients paid the bills.\n I reluctantly clicked off the show, set aside the Windex bottle and rag I had forgotten I was holding, and headed for the front door. As I did so, I instinctively reached up for the pair of Oakley wraparound sunglasses that were no longer there. My next conditioned movement was to check my arms and face and hands for sunscreen - which wasn\u0027t there, either.\n Wasn\u0027t there, and wasn\u0027t needed.\n That is, not since I\u0027d donned the emerald medallion two weeks ago. A medallion that had literally changed my life. A medallion that, curiously, no longer existed.\n Two weeks ago, shortly after watching my first sunrise in seven years, I had reached down for the medallion, only to discover it was missing. Left behind had been a disc-shaped burn in my skin and the empty leather strap that had been holding the medallion.\n Fang had thought my body absorbed the medallion. I had thought that sounded crazy as hell. Fang had reminded me that a skin-absorbing medallion was actually one of the least-craziest things to happen to me in seven years.\n Now, two weeks later, there still remained a faint outline of the medallion on my upper chest, seared into my skin.\n I\u0027m such a weirdo, I thought, and settled for reaching up and checking on my hair. Since mirrors were still out of the question, I had become a master at feeling my way through a good hair day. At least, I hoped they were good hair days.\n As I stood before the front door, a lingering trepidation remained. After all, sunlight had been my enemy for so many years.\n You can do this, I thought.\n And I did. I opened the front door wide as sunlight splashed in. Brilliant sunlight. Splashing over me, but my skin felt...nothing. I felt nothing, and that was the greatest feeling of all.\n No searing pain. No gasping sounds. No stumbling around and covering my eyes. No shrinking like a monster from the light of the day.\n Such a weirdo.\n Maybe. But now, not so weird.\n Thank God.\n Today, I was wearing torn jeans and a cute blouse, a sleeveless blouse, no less. Most importantly, I wasn\u0027t wearing multiple layers of clothing or one of my epic sunhats. Or satellite dishes, as a client had once called them.\n It was just me. And that felt good. Damned good.\n The man standing in the doorway was smaller than I expected. He was wearing a Chicago Bulls tank top and basketball shorts and high-top sneakers. He looked like he might have just stepped off the courts or raided a Foot Locker. The detailed tattoos that ran up and down his arms - and even along his neck - seemed to tell a story about something, although I couldn\u0027t puzzle it out at first blush.\n \"Russell?\" I said.\n \"That\u0027s me,\" he said softly. \"You must be Ms. Moon.\"\n He dipped his head in a way that I found adorable. The dip was part greeting, part submission, and partly to let me know that he came in peace. We shook hands and I led him to my office in the back of my house, passing Anthony\u0027s empty room along the way. Well, not entirely empty. A pair of his white briefs sat in the middle of the floor, briefs that had seen better - and whiter - days. I reached in and quickly shut the door before my client got a good look at the mother of all skid marks.\n Superman had Lex Luthor. Batman had the Joker. I had Anthony\u0027s skid marks.\n Once safe in my office, I showed Russell to one of my client chairs and took a seat behind my cluttered desk.\n \"So, what can I do for you, Russell?\" I asked.\n \"Jacky says you might be able to help me.\"\n \"Jacky, the boxing trainer?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said.\n \"Jacky say anything else?\"\n \"Only that you are a freak of nature.\"\n I grinned. \"He\u0027s always thought highly of me. What kind of help do you need?\"\n He looked at me. Straight in the eye. He held my gaze for a heartbeat or two, then said, \"Somebody died accidentally...except I don\u0027t think it was an accident.\"\n I nodded and did a quick psychic scan of the young man sitting before me. I sensed a heavy heart. Pain. Confusion. I sensed a lot of things. Most important, I did not sense that he was a killer.\n \"Tell me about it,\" I said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-1.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
