{"id":94985,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"After we split up, I sat briefly in my minivan, searching for a psychic hit that wasn\u0027t there. Despite the many abilities I\u0027d been given, a psychic connection to my own kids was not one of them.\n For now, I was just a mom with a missing daughter.\n I had just put the vehicle into gear, mentally going through a list of her friends and where they lived, when my cell phone rang. I gasped and swerved a little and reached for my cell.\n Kingsley Fulcrum.\n Shit.\n I switched on my Bluetooth. \"Hey.\"\n \"Sam! I just got your text. Have you found her?\"\n I had indeed sent him a text, but now I regretted doing so. Kingsley Fulcrum was the last person I wanted to think about now.\n \"Not yet,\" I said, as I turned right onto Commonwealth. My sister lived closer to downtown than I did. People were everywhere. I scanned the streets.\n \"I\u0027m coming out now. Where are you?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t come.\"\n \"What - \"\n \"I sent you that text an hour ago. Where were you?\"\n He paused only briefly, but tellingly. \"I was with a client.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you were, big guy. And don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ve got it handled.\"\n \"Sam - wait! Are you saying you don\u0027t want my help?\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying,\" I said.\n \"Sam - \"\n But I had already clicked off.\n I sat back and gripped the wheel and wound slowly through downtown Fullerton, knowing that I could have used Kingsley\u0027s help, and knowing that I was allowing the hurt in my own heart to possibly get in the way of such help.\n But I just couldn\u0027t see him. Or talk to him.\n Not now. Perhaps not ever. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-15.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) \n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
