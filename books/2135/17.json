Tammy was swinging her legs. I could just make out Mary Lou\u0027s gym bag sitting next to her.\\n\\n With the 5 Freeway roaring above, choked with rush hour traffic, and Orangethorpe Avenue opposite, nearly as busy, no one would have noticed a screaming girl being yanked into someone\u0027s car, never to be seen or heard from again.\\n\\n I inhaled slowly, deeply.\\n\\n But there she was, safely eating ice cream with Spinoza as if she knew the man. She didn\u0027t, of course. She had never met the investigator, and yet, there she was eating ice cream with him. So trusting. So innocent. He could have been anyone. Someone dangerous. Someone with not very good intentions. He wasn\u0027t dangerous, of course. He was a damn fine investigator. But she didn\u0027t know that.\\n\\n Spinoza turned and saw me sitting in my van. Perhaps he was psychic himself. He waved, holding his ice cream. There was a vending machine nearby. No doubt it had been the source of the frozen dessert.\\n\\n I sat in my car and waited for my heart to calm down, for my breathing to calm down, and, as I waited, never once did I take my eyes off my daughter.* * *Spinoza got up and pulled me aside as I approached.\\n\\n \"You know the drill,\" said Spinoza quietly. He was only a few inches taller than me. His height always surprised me. My memory of him was always as a bigger man.\\n\\n I nodded, knowing where this was going.\\n\\n The evening was giving way to dusk, and the lights in the bus stop were turning on. Tammy kicked her feet...and looked away. So far, she hadn\u0027t made eye contact with me. She was dressed in jeans and T-shirt. She had on a pink belt. She was too damn cute to be alone at a bus station.\\n\\n \"She thinks you\u0027re going to be mad at her,\" he said.\\n\\n I nodded. It\u0027s the same speech I gave parents myself, after finding their own runaways.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s also angry.\"\\n\\n I snapped my head around. \"Angry?\"\\n\\n Spinoza gave me a wry smile. \"Life\u0027s unfair and all that. You know, typical girl stuff.\"\\n\\n I nodded, relieved, although I wasn\u0027t sure about that \"girl stuff\" comment.\\n\\n He continued, \"Sherbet\u0027s on his way, too, so you\u0027ll have a few minutes alone with her. I tried to call him off, but he has to follow up, access the situation, finalize a report, and call off the hounds, so to speak.\"\\n\\n I nodded, looked at Spinoza. \"How did you know she was here?\"\\n\\n \"A hunch. I listen to them.\"\\n\\n I suddenly gave him a hug which, I think, surprised the hell out of him, although it shouldn\u0027t have. He was lucky I didn\u0027t give him a smooch, too.\\n\\n \"I do, too,\" I said, releasing him. \"Except this time I couldn\u0027t think straight.\"\\n\\n \"Hard to think straight when your kid\u0027s gone,\" he said, and now there was no mistaking the sorrow in his voice. I knew his own kid was gone. Long gone. He nodded toward Tammy. \"Talk to her, Sam. Gently.\"\\n\\n I said I would. He smiled and nodded and touched my elbow awkwardly, then slipped out into the night.\\n\\n I turned to Tammy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-17.html","bookId":2135,"book":{"id":2135,"title":"Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Games (Vampire for Hire #6) \\n Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home.
