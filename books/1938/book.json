{"id":1938,"title":"Summer on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #6)","description":"Storyline: Summer on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #6) Knitting and life. They\u0027re both about beginnings--and endings. That\u0027s why it makes sense for Lydia Goetz, owner of A Good Yarn on Seattle\u0027s Blossom Street, to offer a class called Knit to Quit. It\u0027s for people who want to quit something--or someone!--and start a new phase of their lives.First to join is Phoebe Rylander. She recently ended her engagement to a man who doesn\u0027t know the meaning of \"faithful, \" and she\u0027s trying to get over him. Then there\u0027s Alix Turner. She and her husband, Jordan, want a baby, which means she \"has\" to quit smoking. And Bryan Hutchinson joins the class because he needs a way to deal with the stress of running his family\u0027s business--not to mention the lawsuit brought against him by an unscrupulous lawyer. Life can be as complicated as a knitting pattern. Just ask Anne Marie Roche. She and her adopted daughter, Ellen, finally have the happiness they wished for. And then a stranger comes to her bookstore asking questions. Or ask Lydia herself. Not only is she coping with her increasingly frail mother, but she and Brad have unexpectedly become foster parents to an angry, defiant twelve-year-old. But as Lydia already knows, when life gets difficult and your stitches are snarled, your friends can \"always\" help!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/summer-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-6.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":49,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
