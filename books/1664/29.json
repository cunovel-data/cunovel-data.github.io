Warm fingers brushed my cheek. I’m sorry you had to see that.\n I’m sorry you had to be a part of that. I took a deep breath. But you know what happened to Largent isn’t on your conscience, right?\n Yes. I know. Trust me, Kitten, I’m not going to take on any unnecessary guilt. His sigh shuttled through me. So, about Archer…\n We talked a couple more minutes about Archer. Both of us agreed that there was a good chance he was Luc’s inside guy, but it didn’t make sense. Archer obviously had access to the LH-11 and could’ve gotten it for Luc. We couldn’t trust him—we weren’t going to make the mistake of trusting anyone again.\n But I did have an idea. One that Daemon was also interested in. Once we got our hands on the LH-11, we had only one chance to escape. And if the origins really were like raptors, then they could become the perfect distraction, allowing us a small shot to bust out of there.\n No matter what we did, it would be risky, with about a 99 percent fail rate. But both Daemon and I felt more confident relying on each other than just Luc—and possibly Archer. We’d been burned way too many times before.\n Daemon took his human form and kissed me quickly before we went back into our rooms. This was always the hardest—forcing ourselves to go to our own beds—but the last thing we needed was to risk getting caught up in the moment…in each other. Because that always seemed to happen when we were together. And we also didn’t fully trust that they’d allow us to come and go from each other’s rooms—everything felt like a test.\n I headed back to my bed. Sitting down, I pulled my knees up to my chest and rested my chin on them. Those quiet moments of doing nothing were the worst. In no time, things I didn’t want to think about crept in and pushed away the stuff I needed to focus on.\n I really wanted Daemon to see that I was holding it together, that none of this was messing with my head. I didn’t want him to worry about me.\n Closing my eyes, I shifted until my forehead was against my knees. I told myself the cheesiest thing possible: there was a light at the end of this dark tunnel. I followed that up with the ever faithful: every dark cloud had a silver lining.\n I wondered how long I could keep telling myself that.\n Daemon\n The wondrous team behind Daedalus actually waited until the mutation took hold this time around. It was another recruit who apparently had been all kinds of gung ho. This one stabbed himself in the chest, right below the heart instead of the gut. Still messy. Kat had been there to witness it again. I had healed the idiot. Overall it was a relative success, except I couldn’t get near the LH-11. A damn shame, because there had been serum left over in the syringe.\n Kat and I weren’t relying on Luc, but if we could get the LH-11, and if it turned out that someone, whether it was Archer or not, could help us get out, I was going to take it. Kat’s plan of letting the kids loose was the best we had, but the technicalities of how we could do that remained to be seen. Not to mention we had no idea what we’d actually be unleashing. As much as I hated to admit it, there were innocent people in these buildings.\n In the three days while we waited for the second guinea pig to show signs of mutation, I was asked to heal three more soldiers and one who had to be a civilian—a female who looked too nervous to have signed up for this without coercion. She didn’t stab herself but was injected with a lethal dose of something.\n And I hadn’t been able to heal her, like, at all. I didn’t know what it was, and it had been terrible. She’d started foaming at the mouth, convulsing, and I tried, but there had been nothing I could do. I couldn’t see the injury in my head, and it just didn’t work.\n The woman had died right there, under Kat’s horrified gaze.\n Nancy hadn’t been happy when they carted off the woman’s motionless body. Her mood was compounded on the fourth day, when Prometheus, otherwise known as LH-11, was given to the second soldier I had healed. Later that day, he ended up face-planting a wall. I didn’t know what it was with them and running into walls, but that was number two.\n On the fifth day, the third subject was given LH-11. He lasted an additional twenty-four hours before bleeding out through every orifice, including the belly button. Or that was what I was told.\n The deaths, well, they did stack up, one after another. Kind of hard not to take them personally. Did I blame myself? Hell to the no. Did it piss me off and make me want to douse the entire compound in gasoline and start throwing matches? Hell yes.\n They kept me away from Kat most of the days, only allowing us to be in the same room when I did the healing thing, and we had a few minutes here and there in our bathroom of secrets. It wasn’t enough. Kat looked as exhausted as I felt, which I’d thought would’ve given my hormones a rest, but oh no. Every time I heard the shower click on, I had to call upon every ounce of self-control. The bathrooms didn’t have cameras, and I could be quiet, which was perfect for a little freaky deaky, but there was no way in hell I was risking the chance of baby Daemons in this hellhole.\n Was I totally against the idea of having kids with Kat one day? Other than breaking out in hives at the thought of that, the idea wasn’t too horrible. Of course, I wanted the white picket fence bullshit…if it occurred a good ten years from now, and the kids didn’t have weird bowl haircuts and couldn’t Jedi mind-screw people.\n I didn’t think that was asking too much.\n On the sixth day, when the third soldier was given LH-11, he made it through the rest of the day and well into the seventh day. He immediately began showing signs of a successful mutation. He passed the stress test with flying colors.\n Nancy was so thrilled, I thought she was going to kiss me—and I thought I was actually going to have to hit a chick.\n “You deserve a reward,” she said, and I thought I deserved to put my foot up her ass. “You may spend the night with Kat. No one will stop you from doing so.”\n I said nothing. While I wasn’t going to turn that down, it was rather creepy hearing Nancy tell me I could spend the night with Kat while they watched us on video. I thought of those kids on the lower floors. Yeah, not going to happen.\n Kat had been up to something, inching closer to the tray. She had stopped when Nancy made her announcement. Her nose wrinkled, and I was a bit insulted, although she was probably thinking the same thing I was.\n They brought in another subject, this one another soldier, but I was distracted by whatever Kat was doing. She was way too close to the trays, practically standing in front of them.\n A stabbing motion later, and I had blood on my hands and a very happy Nancy bouncing around the room.\n Dr. Roth had placed the spent needle next to the unused ones. I saw Kat make grabby fingers, but something occurred to me.\n “Does this mean I’m joined to them?” I asked, wiping my hands on a towel that had been all but thrown at me. “The ones who don’t face-plant a wall? If I die, they die?”\n Nancy laughed.\n My brows rose. “I don’t see how that’s a funny question.”\n “It’s a very good, self-serving question.” She clasped her hands together, dark eyes glimmering. “No. The Prometheus serum that is given to the mutated subject breaks the bond.”\n That was a relief. I didn’t like the idea of several Achilles’ heels running around. “How is that possible?”\n A guard opened the door as Nancy crossed the room. “We’ve had many years to narrow down the interworking of the mutation and the consequences, Daemon. Just as we know that there needs to be a true want behind the mutation.” She turned to me, head tilted to the side. “Yes. We’ve known that. It’s not a magical or spiritual thing, but a mixture of ability, strength, and determination.”\n Well, shit…\n “Your brother was almost there.” Nancy’s voice lowered, and my body tensed. “It wasn’t lack of determination or ability. And trust me, he was motivated. We made sure of that. But he simply was not strong enough.”\n I locked my jaw down. Anger slithered through my veins like venom.\n “We don’t need him. Bethany, on the other hand, well, that’s yet to be seen. But you?” She placed a hand on my chest. “You’re a keeper, Daemon.”\n Chapter 18\n Katy\n You’re a keeper, Daemon.\n Oh my God, I almost stabbed the needle through Nancy’s eye. Good thing I didn’t, because that would defeat the whole purpose of what I’d done.\n Crossing my arms, I folded my hands around the syringe and kept it hidden under my arm. I dutifully followed Daemon and Archer out, half expecting someone to tackle me from behind.\n No one did.\n In the excitement of a potentially successful mutation, no one was paying attention to me. No one besides Daemon ever did during these things, except Archer, and if he was peeping into my thoughts, he sure as hell hadn’t said anything.\n I hadn’t really thought any of this through when I grabbed the serum, but as I held it in my hand, I knew that if I did get caught, I was probably going to regret it. So would Daemon. If Archer was peeking in my thoughts right now, and he wasn’t working with Luc, we were so screwed.\n We went to the elevator, Nancy and the newly mutated hybrid heading in the other direction. We were alone—just the three of us—as the elevator doors slid shut. I almost couldn’t believe our luck. My heart was pounding with excitement and fear, like a drummer doing a solo.\n Nudging Daemon in the arm, I got his attention. He glanced at me, and I looked down at my hand, carefully opening my fingers. Just the tip of the top of the syringe was visible. His eyes flicked up and widened, meeting mine.\n In that instant, both of us knew what this meant. With the LH-11 in hand, we had no time. Someone would eventually realize it was missing, or they might’ve even caught me on the security tapes. Either way, it was do or die time.\n The elevator doors slid shut, and Archer turned to us. Daemon shifted forward, but Archer’s hand shot out. My breath caught in my throat as his hand hit the control panel. The elevator didn’t move.\n Archer’s gaze dropped to my hand, and his head tilted to the side. “You have the LH-11? Jesus. You two are… I didn’t think you’d do it. Luc said you would.” His eyes flicked to Daemon. “But I really didn’t think either of you would pull it off.”\n My heart was pounding so fast my fingers tingled around the needle. “What are you going to do about it?”\n “I know what you’re thinking.” Archer’s attention was on Daemon. “Why didn’t I get the serum for Luc? That’s not what I was here for, and we don’t have time to explain it. They’re going to know it’s missing very soon.” There was a quick pause, and he was back to me. “And the plan in your head is crazy.”\n I had been thinking about the origins, but now I was thinking about Rainbow Brite doing the Electric Slide. Anything to keep Archer out of my head.\n He made a face. “Seriously, guys?” he said, taking off his beret. He shoved it in his back pocket. “What exactly do you two hope to accomplish? Your plan has a hundred percent fail rate.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/origin-lux-4/page-29.html","bookId":1664,"book":{"id":1664,"title":"Origin (Lux #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Origin (Lux #4) \n Daemon will do anything to get Katy back. \n After the successful but disastrous raid on Mount Weather, he’s facing the impossible.
