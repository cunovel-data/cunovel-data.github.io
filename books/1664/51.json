Red light streamed past my face, spinning me around. A bolt of white light arced, and I heard a body hit the ground behind me. I saw Kat before me, her pupils glowing. I turned slowly, finding a soldier on the ground, a PEP weapon by his lifeless hand. “I can help,” she said. You saved my life. I turned back to her. That is so hot. She shook her head and lifted her chin. “We need to get— Oh my God, Daemon. Daemon.” My heart tripped in response to the fear in her voice. I started toward her, and then I felt it. I felt it deep and in every part of my being. I saw Dawson stop. I saw Andrew spin back. Over the neon signs for Caesar’s Palace and the Bellagio hotel, dark clouds moved incredibly fast, blocking out the stars. But they weren’t clouds…or a swarm of bats. They were Arum. Katy Things went from bad to craptastic in a matter of seconds. At no point from the second Daemon had announced his plan, up until the military took down the chopper full of innocent humans, had I believed that it would go down like this. All we’d wanted was to throw them off guard—to cause a little bit of chaos to make our escape. We hadn’t planned on starting a war. Now Paris was dead and something worse than monsters under the bed was coming our way. At no point did I doubt that the shadows racing across the sky were not here on accident. Yeah, there was a lot of Luxen mojo going on right now, but the likelihood of Arum just popping up and joining the fun? Not likely. They were here because of Daedalus, because they worked with them. The dark cloud broke apart, streaming across the sky like blotches of insidious oil. It dipped behind Caesar’s Palace, disappearing for a second, and then exploded out of the side of the hotel. Shards of glass and debris flew into the air. I opened my mouth to scream, but there was no sound. An Arum came down the Boulevard, moving so fast I couldn’t even say it took a second to get where it was going. Flying over the back of the Hummer, it slammed into Andrew, lifting him several feet into the air. Ash’s horror-filled scream ricocheted through me. The Arum took shape mid-flight, its skin black and shiny like obsidian. It threw Andrew like he was a rag doll and nothing more. Another Arum shot down the strip, zipping in and around the cars. It rose, catching Andrew, and the two of them nosedived into the Treasure Island pool. Daemon leaped off the ground—a burst of bright light and then he was in the air—slamming into the other Arum, cutting him off from the pool. They collided, a mixture of darkness and light, rolling through the sky like a cannonball. Dawson raced forward, dodging the blasts of red light. The Arum and Andrew resurfaced in the pool and, rearing back, the Arum slammed its hand into Andrew’s chest. He jerked, his light flickering like a lightning bug. I started forward, but arms circled my waist. It wasn’t a friendly hug. Panic sliced through me as my feet were lifted off the ground just as I saw the Arum lift Andrew into the air. Another pulse of light, and then Andrew… Oh God… Ash’s scream confirmed what I suspected. I saw her switch into her true form and then back out again, like she couldn’t control it. A wave of energy rolled across the lanes. A second later I was on my back, the air knocked from my lungs, and I was staring up into a shielded face. My breath faltered, and for a moment I had no idea what to do. I was frozen, caught between disbelief and terror. Paris was dead. Andrew was dead. The muzzle of a strange-looking gun was pointed right at my face. “Don’t even think about moving,” the muffled voice said. My brain stopped processing things at a normal level and speed. As I stared up, my own wide eyes reflected in the tactical helmet, the human part of me switched off. Rage boiled up in me, and it felt good. It wasn’t fear or panic or grief. It was power. The scream that had been building inside me, the kind of scream that left an imprint on its surroundings decades later, let loose. I don’t know how I did it, but the soldier and his gun were no longer above me. All around me, vehicles rattled and slid forward, overturning. Glass cracked and then exploded, pelting the road and me with tiny shards. The little nicks of pain were nothing. Who knew where the soldier went? He was simply gone, and that was all that mattered. I pushed myself up, looking around. Fire poured out of Treasure Island and Caesar’s Palace. The Mirage was smoking. Windows were knocked out of cars. Bodies were lying in the street. I’d never seen such destruction before, not in real life. I searched for Daemon and my friends, finding him first. He was battling an Arum, and they were nothing more than a blur of black and white. Archer was wrestling with the Arum from the pool, and Dee was pulling Andrew’s lifeless body from its depths. Water streamed off her face and clung to her hair. She got him over the retaining wall and wrapped her arms around him. The scene…it made every part of me hurt. I turned to where Ash was still guarding Beth. She was in her human form and looked torn between doing what she promised Dawson and going to her brother. That was something I could do. I could keep Beth safe, and Ash could go where she needed to be. The military chopper circled back around, halting my progress. Archer appeared out of nowhere. The Source radiated over him like a wave of light, and he threw out his arms. A bolt of pure white light hit the belly of the chopper, sending it spinning back toward one of the casinos. The impact was deafening, and the resulting fireball lit up the night sky. I turned back to where he had been standing, but he was gone, like a ninja. Jesus. Digging my toes into the cracked pavement, I eyed the path to Beth and Ash. Luc had the soldiers occupied. Or what was left of them. There was this god-awful smell that turned my stomach, and I remembered what the origins could do. Apparently, evil little fire-starters could be added to their list of freakish descriptors. I pushed out, running around an overturned truck. Beth’s head swung in my direction. Her arms were wrapped around her waist protectively. She looked terrified. I made it around a downed palm tree and was so close. And then I was off my feet, flying backward. I hit the side of a van; the impact rocked my body and snapped my head back. Darts of pain shot down my spine. My sight clouded as I slid to the road. Criminy. That hurt. I blinked slowly, trying to clear my vision. Groaning, I rolled onto my side and placed my hands on the split asphalt. My arm shook as I attempted to push myself up. My insides felt rattled and rearranged. I needed to get— Darkness crept along the edge of my vision. There was a second before I realized it wasn’t because I was on the verge of passing out. Goose bumps rose along my arms. Something cold pressed along me. Arum. I flattened my body and wiggled under the van, seeking a few extra seconds to regain my strength and bearings. The smell of oil and fumes clogged my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut as I slid over the road, ignoring how the asphalt abraded my skin. I made it out on the other side and crawled around a sedan, gripping the bumper to lift myself. The van started to shake, and then it slid out of the way. The Arum stood in his human form, pale and eerily beautiful, a cold and apathetic beauty that stole my breath and repelled me. A slow, unnerving smile twisted his lips, and it was like being hit with frigid air. He didn’t speak as he raised his arms. Air stirred around me as I stumbled backward. Behind me, the palms shook and metal groaned. Wind roared, and at the last second I ducked. The trees were uprooted, spinning toward the Arum. The car slipped out of my grasp as if he were sucking it in. A tourist brochure rack spun in the air. Pieces of the road rose up, hovered for a second, and then flew to him. There was a sharp scream that pierced my ears. A woman was flung past me, disappearing behind the Arum. Another crumpled body joined those on the ground. He was like his own personal black hole, sucking up everything around and drawing it to him. I was no exception. No matter how hard I dug in, my feet dragged over the ground. His icy fingers wrapped around my throat, and he lowered his head to mine. I couldn’t remember seeing an Arum’s eyes before. They were the palest shade of blue, like all the color had been leeched from them. “What do we have here?” The Arum spoke out loud. He inhaled deeply, closing his eyes as if he could taste me. “A hybrid. Tasty.” I was so not down with being an intergalactic late-night snack. I threw my arm back, pulling on the Source, but the Arum’s free hand clamped down on my wrist, his grip punishing. My heart leaped in my throat as his cold cheek pressed against mine. His lips moved near my ear, sending a shudder of revulsion through me. “This might hurt. A little,” he said, and then he laughed harshly. “Okay. It might hurt a lot.” He was going to feed. And that little part of my brain that still functioned thought this was a hell of a way to go out. After everything—Daedalus, the guns, the bullets, and everything else—I was going to be sucked dry. Everything tightened inside me, a mixture of fear and rage, disgust and panic. It unraveled like a compressed Slinky, lashing out from the inside. Energy roared through me, heightened my senses. I felt the Arum against me. I felt him align his mouth with mine, a scant few inches apart. I felt the breath he took, the deep shudder of power opening up inside him. And I felt the chilling, sucking pull that reached deep inside me, digging in with tiny hooks. I placed my hand on the Arum’s chest, and that rush of energy left me like a sucker punch. There was no space between it and the Arum, nothing to lessen the effect. The Source exploded from me and immediately went into the Arum. The flare of light from me to him was intense. Energy imploded, throwing us apart. The stars did cartwheels. I hit the pavement on my side and rolled onto my back. The Arum was suspended in the air, his arms and legs spread wide. His body trembled once, then twice. A spot of light over his chest, the mark the Source had left behind, raced across his body in tiny fissures of white cracks, encompassing his entire body. He burst into a thousand little pieces. Holy alien babies… As I staggered to my feet and twisted at the waist, my eyes met that of a young man. He looked like someone who was on autopilot, seeing everything but not really understanding what he was witnessing. I kind of sympathized with the dude. I was sure I’d had that same WTF look on my face when I saw Daemon stop the truck and realized I wasn’t dealing with something human. I probably had that WTF look on my face right now. My gaze dipped. In his white-knuckled grip was a smartphone. Everything—he had captured everything on his cell phone. Namely my face. Such a stupid thing to worry about in that moment, especially considering everything else he must’ve captured, but I thought of this video being loaded on the Internet, going viral like those damn Hey Girl memes. This wasn’t how I’d wanted my mom to discover that I was alive. Maybe not alive and well, but definitely kicking around.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/origin-lux-4/page-51.html","bookId":1664,"book":{"id":1664,"title":"Origin (Lux #4)","description":"Storyline: Origin (Lux #4) Daemon will do anything to get Katy back.
