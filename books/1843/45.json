{"id":76899,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"The command didn\u0027t sit well with her. \"This wife doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Damn it, Gillian, don\u0027t turn stubborn on me.\"\\n\\n \"A husband doesn\u0027t curse in his wife\u0027s presence.\"\\n\\n \"This husband does,\" he snapped.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t like hearing that either. Tossing her brush on the table, she got up and took the long way around him to get to the bed. Then she kicked her slippers off and sat down.\\n\\n Ramsey had been right after all. Some wives really didn\u0027t like taking orders from their husbands, and Gillian obviously fit into that category. He noticed the tears brimming in her eyes and knew he\u0027d injured her feelings. Marriage was far more difficult than he\u0027d anticipated.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"Do what?\"\\n\\n \"Cry.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t think of it,\" she haughtily replied. She stood up, pulled the covers back, and got into bed.\\n\\n He blew out the candles and was going to bank the fire in the hearth when she asked him to please add another log. \"It\u0027s hot in here.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m cold.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep you warm.\"\\n\\n When he sat on the bed to take his boots off, she rolled to her side to face the wall. In a whisper, she asked, \"Are you sorry you married me?\"\\n\\n The question caught him off guard. Gillian was obviously feeling a bit insecure, and he knew he was responsible because he\u0027d been acting like a bear from the moment he\u0027d joined her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too soon to tell,\" he told her with a straight face.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t appreciate the humor. \"Are you sorry?\"\\n\\n He put his hand on her hip and forced her to turn toward him. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re so stubborn, but I\u0027m happy I married you.\"\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t acting happy.\"\\n\\n \"You defied me.\"\\n\\n \"And you aren\u0027t accustomed to anyone refusing you, are you?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \" \u0027Tis the truth I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n \"Brodick, when we are with others, I will never argue with you, but when we are alone, I will tell you exactly what\u0027s on my mind.\"\\n\\n He thought about that for a moment and then nodded. \"Did something happen tonight that\u0027s upset you? When I left you this morning, you were happy.\"\\n\\n \"When you left, I was sleeping.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, but you had a smile on your face,\" he teased. \"You were no doubt dreaming about me.\"\\n\\n \"As a matter of fact, I\u0027ve had an aggravating day.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me about it,\" he suggested.\\n\\n \"You really want to hear my complaints?\" she asked, amazed.\\n\\n His nod was all the encouragement she needed, and she sat up and proceeded to tell him everything. \"First, Ramsey made me sit in the hall all morning long and look at face after face as more of his followers came inside. Then when I still hadn\u0027t found the man who betrayed him, he dragged me all over kingdom come to look at more faces. He was too busy to speak to Christen on my behalf,\" she added. \"And Brisbane had already come back to report that my sister still hasn\u0027t changed her mind. I\u0027m not going to continue to be patient, Brodick. I\u0027m giving Ramsey until noon tomorrow to order Christen to come forward, and if he doesn\u0027t, then I\u0027m going to take matters into my own hands.\"\\n\\n She took a deep breath and then continued. \"I finally met Bridgid at the lake, but it was already close to suppertime by then, and when she joined me, she had disappointing news.\"\\n\\n \"What was her news?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"She asked a friend to follow Brisbane to find out where Christen lives, but the friend didn\u0027t return to the holding. Bridgid thinks he forgot.\"\\n\\n Brodick stood up and stretched. Gillian watched the muscles across his shoulders flex and was taken aback by the sheer might of his body. Then he removed his belt and stripped out of his clothes, and she promptly lost her train of thought altogether. Her husband was so incredibly beautiful.\\n\\n \"So you thought that if you knew where Christen lived, you would simply go to her?\"\\n\\n He waited a long minute for her to answer, then repeated the question.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she stammered, flustered. \"That\u0027s what I thought.\"\\n\\n \"Christen\u0027s a MacPherson and now part of the Sinclair clan.\"\\n\\n \"I realize that.\"\\n\\n \"Ramsey\u0027s her laird and you shouldn\u0027t interfere. Let him handle this. He promised you he\u0027d force her to see you.\"\\n\\n He dropped to the bed on his stomach, his weight all but knocking her to the floor.\\n\\n Though he was loath to admit it, he was exhausted.\\n\\n \"Ramsey promised me he\u0027d talk to her today, but he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n With a loud yawn, he said, \"He\u0027s a busy man, Gillian.\"\\n\\n \"I know he is. People are constantly hounding him with problems, and the women here won\u0027t leave him alone. They make up all sorts of petty worries just so they can talk to him. It must drive him to distraction. Still, he promised me, Brodick, and he has until noon tomorrow to speak to Christen.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t want her to stop talking because he loved the husky sound of her voice.\\n\\n \"What else happened today?\"\\n\\n \"I hid from Father Laggan,\" she confessed. Brodick laughed, and she had to wait until he\u0027d stopped to ask, \"Did you perchance have an opportunity to speak to him?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he replied. \"He had a hell of a hangover.\"\\n\\n \"Ramsey got him drunk on purpose, didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Laggan was already well on his way, but Ramsey helped.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a sin,\" she decided. \"Why did he do it?\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s my good friend and he knew that one way or another, I was going to take you to my bed.\"\\n\\n She put her hand on his shoulder, noticed how tense he was, and began to rub his muscles. He groaned with pleasure, and so she pulled her gown up, straddled his hips, and used both hands to work the tension out of him. \"Damn, that feels good.\"\\n\\n She was also feeling relaxed, and she realized it was because she had shared her day with Brodick. \"What did you do today?\"\\n\\n \"I went home.\"\\n\\n \"But you told me your holding is a long way from here.\"\\n\\n \"I rode hard,\" he said. \"But it was past sunset by the time I got back.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do at home?\"\\n\\n \"Settled a few problems,\" he said.\\n\\n She remembered another bit of news to share with him then. \"Do you know what Bridgid told me today?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"A woman tried to sneak into Ramsey\u0027s room… at least that\u0027s what Bridgid thought. So she went in after her, and the sinful woman had taken her clothes off and was going to… you know.\"\\n\\n Grinning, he said, \"No, tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Seduce Ramsey, of course. Bridgid threw her out and made quite a scene. Now she\u0027s furious with her laird because he bluntly told her he had invited the woman to share his bed. If he\u0027s going to have women parading into his bedroom every night, Bridgid\u0027s made up her mind to leave.\"\\n\\n \"And where will she go?\"\\n\\n \"We discussed that very problem on the way to chapel. We wanted to light a candle for Gideon\u0027s father and another one for Ramsey\u0027s soul. Bridgid is convinced he\u0027s on his way to purgatory.\"\\n\\n The heat of her thighs pressed against his was starting to interfere with his ability to concentrate. \"Why would you light a candle for Gideon\u0027s father? You don\u0027t know the man.\"\\n\\n \"Because the poor man took a turn for the worse. Bridgid heard Faudron tell Ramsey so when he was explaining why Gideon has been delayed. Faudron and Anthony will share the commander\u0027s duties until he returns.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a good heart, lass.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you light a candle for me if I were dying?\"\\n\\n \"Do not talk about such things. I would not let you die,\" he said vehemently.\\n\\n She leaned down and kissed his shoulder. \"I told Bridgid she could come and live with the Buchanans. She tried to hide her reaction to my suggestion, but it was obvious she was horrified by the idea. Isn\u0027t that peculiar?\"\\n\\n \"It would be a difficult adjustment for her. Ramsey treats his followers like children. I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t have a difficult adjustment.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you will.\"\\n\\n \"No, I won\u0027t, because you\u0027ll be there. I don\u0027t care where I live or how I live as long as you are by my side.\"\\n\\n He was humbled by her faith and love. \"Now that I\u0027m married, I\u0027ll have to make some changes,\" he remarked.\\n\\n \"Such as?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll probably want a home.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have a home now?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Where do you sleep?\" she asked, trying not to sound appalled.\\n\\n \"On the ground. I much prefer it to a soft bed.\"\\n\\n \"But what do you do when it rains?\"\\n\\n Her voice sounded strained, and he knew she was having difficulty staying calm. Her hands weren\u0027t rubbing his shoulders now; they were pounding them.\\n\\n \"I get wet.\"\\n\\n She began to pray he wasn\u0027t serious. \"What about your followers? Do they also sleep outside?\"\\n\\n \"Some do, but the married men live in cottages like this one with their women.\"\\n\\n \"Why doesn\u0027t their laird?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had no need for one.\"\\n\\n \"You do now. I don\u0027t want to sleep outside.\"\\n\\n \"You will sleep with me.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but I want a home.\"\\n\\n \"Like Ramsey\u0027s?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" she answered. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be grand. One just like this cottage would be nice.\"\\n\\n She stopped rubbing his shoulders and traced a crescent-shaped scar below his right shoulder. \"How did you get this?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember. It happened a long time ago.\"\\n\\n \"It must have hurt,\" she said. She kissed the jagged gray line, noticed his muscles tightened, and kissed him again. Then she stretched out on top of him and put her head down on his shoulder.\\n\\n He groaned. \"You\u0027re killing me, Gillian.\"\\n\\n \"Am I too heavy for you?\"\\n\\n \"That isn\u0027t what I mean. If you don\u0027t stop wiggling, I\u0027m going to make love to you, and I know you\u0027re tender.\"\\n\\n The heat radiating from his body warmed her. \"Not so very tender,\" she whispered. \"And you weren\u0027t worried about that during the night.\"\\n\\n \"Then you remember? I thought you slept through it.\"\\n\\n She knew he was teasing her. \"Yes, I did sleep through it. It must have been a dream that made me scream.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, you were screaming,\" he agreed, smiling over the memory. \"I made you burn, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"How would I know? I was asleep.\"\\n\\n She began to stroke his arms, loving the feel of him. \"You\u0027re so hard,\" she whispered.\\n\\n She was far more accurate than she realized. He was hard from wanting her, but he was pleased by her boldness and curiosity.\\n\\n \"Brodick?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Could we … if you\u0027re not too tired and you didn\u0027t have to move… could I…\"\\n\\n \"Could you what?\" he asked.\\n\\n She finally got up the courage to get the words out. \"Could I make love to you?\"\\n\\n \"But I won\u0027t have to move?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she insisted.\\n\\n He laughed. \"Sweetheart, moving is a definite requirement.\"\\n\\n Her hands caressed the sinewy ripples of his back as she slowly moved down his body. She wanted to kiss him everywhere.\\n\\n \"Gillian,\" he began gruffly.\\n\\n \"Hush,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m making love to you this time. You said I could.\"\\n\\n \"May I offer a suggestion?\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll work better if you let me turn over.\"\\n\\n He rolled onto his back, grabbed her, and kissed her hungrily as he helped her untie the ribbon of her gown and watched her blush as she pulled the gown over her head and tossed it aside.\\n\\n \"You are so beautiful,\" he whispered. He kissed her again.\\n\\n The teasing ended then as passion flared. Trembling in his arms, she became more demanding. He entered her swiftly, completely, and the pleasure was so intense, so blissful, he closed his eyes and groaned loudly, \"Lord, you feel good.\"\\n\\n And then he began to move within her, slowly, deliberately until she was writhing out of control. The thrilling sensations drove him on, and when he felt her tighten around him and heard her cry his name, he cl**axed deep inside her.\\n\\n Spent, he collapsed on top of her and stayed there long minutes until his heart stopped slamming inside his chest and he could draw a decent breath.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve exhausted me,\" he whispered gruffly as he rolled to his side and pulled her up against him. Her back was against his chest and her sweet derriere was pressed against his groin. The scent of their lovemaking clung to their bodies; the only sound was that of the logs crackling in the hearth and Gillian\u0027s occasional sigh.\\n\\n \"I had no idea I was going to like this so much.\"\\n\\n \"I did,\" he told her. \"I knew the first time I kissed you. I could feel the passion in you. I knew you were going to be wild, and I was right.\"\\n\\n \"Because I love you,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d be so… free… with any other man.\"\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t ever going to find out,\" he said. \"No other man will ever touch you.\"\\n\\n Before he could get riled up, she soothed him. \"I don\u0027t want any other man. I want only you. I love you, now and forever.\"\\n\\n Her fervent words pleased him. Lifting her hand, he kissed her wrist. \"Does this still bother you?\" he asked as he looked at the scars puckering her skin.\\n\\n \"No,\" she answered. She tried to pull her hand away then. \"But it\u0027s unsightly.\"\\n\\n He kissed her ear. \"Nothing about you is unsightly.\"\\n\\n And then he proceeded to kiss every mark on her arm, and by the time he reached her elbow, she was shivering.\\n\\n Just as Gillian was contentedly drifting off to sleep, he nudged her. \"Do you trust me?\"\\n\\n \"You know that I do.\"\\n\\n \"Then give me the names of the Englishmen.\"\\n\\n She was suddenly wide awake. Turning in his arms, she looked into his eyes. \"I want you to promise me something first.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n She sat up, pulled the covers around her, and leaned against the wall. \"You know that I have to return to England. You understood that before you married me, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He knew where this was leading and frowned. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"I knew you wanted to return to England.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-45.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
