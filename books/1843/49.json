If this keeps up, you\u0027ll be dead in another month, and if that happens, I\u0027m going to be damned angry.\" \"I was beaten, yes, but that was before I met you,\" she said, believing she was being quite logical. \"And Alec didn\u0027t stab me. He cut my arm, but only because he was so frightened. It was just bad luck that it didn\u0027t heal. As for the arrow,\" she continued, \"it only pinched my skin. You saw the cut; it wasn\u0027t bad.\" \"It could have pierced your heart.\" \"But it didn\u0027t.\" She demanded that he put her down, and when he did, she walked to a tree so that he could see she was as fit as ever. Then she leaned against it to take the weight off the throbbing leg. Forcing a smile, she said, \"Do you see? I\u0027m quite all right.\" Brodick turned away from her and stared out into the night, brooding. He didn\u0027t say a word for several minutes. \"I made up my mind a long time ago that no woman would ever unsettle me again. I will not let it happen.\" \"What are you telling me?\" His temper exploded. \"You and I struck a bargain when we married, and you\u0027re going to live up to your end of it.\" \"What bargain?\" she asked quietly. \"You married me for my protection.\" \"I married you because I love you. Now, tell me, Brodick. Why did you marry me? What did you get out of this bargain?\" He wouldn\u0027t answer, but she wasn\u0027t about to give up. Prodding him, she asked, \"Did you marry me because you loved me?\" She held her breath until he answered. \"Love weakens a man, and I\u0027m not weak.\" His hard words shattered her heart. She bowed her head so he wouldn\u0027t see how he had hurt her. \"You told me you wanted to protect my reputation. I remember that conversation, but even then I knew that wasn\u0027t the real reason you married me. I thought… I hoped, anyway… that you cared for me. I knew you were grateful because I helped Alec and you\u0027re his guardian, but surely you didn\u0027t marry me out of gratitude. A simple thank you would have been enough.\" \"I had a responsibility to you, Gillian, and that is all that need be said about my reasons.\" \"You care for me, Brodick. I know you do.\" He turned away from her. He was acting like a cornered animal. He had never hedged or skirted an issue before. No, he\u0027d been honest and blunt, but now he was deliberately being evasive. It made her worry all the more. What he wasn\u0027t telling her frightened her. Why was it so difficult for him to admit what was in his heart. \"I ask you again. Why did you marry me?\" He refused to answer. \"Ramsey\u0027s here,\" he said then. \"I\u0027ll carry you back, and then you\u0027re going to start at the beginning and tell both of us what happened today.\" \"I can walk,\" she assured him. \"You go ahead. I\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\" \"You\u0027re coming with me now,\" he told her, and before she could argue, he picked her up and carried her back to the clearing. One of the soldiers had started a campfire in the center of the grassy flat, and all the Buchanans sat in a circle around the flames. Proster, Ker, and Alan stood together near Ramsey and his men while Proster waited to give his laird their accounting. Bridgid faced her laird, and after one quick glance, Gillian knew her friend was hearing Ramsey\u0027s displeasure. Brodick settled Gillian on the plaid Dylan had spread out for her, but she didn\u0027t stay there. As soon as he turned his back and walked away, she got to her feet and went to Bridgid. \"Ramsey, don\u0027t blame Bridgid for what happened. She isn\u0027t responsible.\" \"Then Bridgid was forced to leave the holding?\" His voice was deceptively mild, but Gillian knew he was seething with anger. \"No, of course she wasn\u0027t forced.\" \"I take full responsibility for my actions,\" Bridgid said. \"If anyone is responsible for what happened today, you are, Ramsey. Yes, you are,\" Gillian added when he looked so incredulous. \"If you had kept your promise to me, this incident could have been avoided.\" \"What promise?\" he demanded. \"It meant so little to you that you have already forgotten?\" Ramsey glared at Brodick, obviously seeking his assistance. \"Your wife believes I\u0027m responsible.\" \"She\u0027s wrong.\" Folding her arms defiantly, she boldly turned to Brodick. \"I warned you that I would give Ramsey until noon today to do as he promised and order my sister to see me, but he didn\u0027t, and so I took matters into my own hands. Bridgid was kind enough to help me.\" Ramsey was seething now. \"I haven\u0027t had time to speak to your sister, and your impatience nearly got you killed.\" Bridgid tried to deflect some of her laird\u0027s anger. \"It was all for the good,\" she blurted out, and when Ramsey and Brodick looked at her as though she\u0027d lost her senses, she hastened to explain. \"You never would have known that Faudron and Durston wanted to hurt Gillian, and now perhaps you can figure out why.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re angry with us,\" Gillian said then. \"And I\u0027ll admit we did take a needless risk, but in our defense, I would point out that neither one of us knew we were leaving your territory.\" \"Laird, may I speak freely?\" Bridgid asked. \"What the hell have you been doing?\" he countered. She shook her head. \"You\u0027re my laird and I respect you, and for that reason I will not lose my temper. I would appreciate it if you would treat me with the same consideration, for I am one of your most loyal followers.\" \"Bridgid, I\u0027m going to assume that the bump on your head has addled you and that\u0027s why you dare to speak to me this way.\" \"Please don\u0027t be angry with her,\" Gillian pleaded on her friend\u0027s behalf. \"This is all my fault. It\u0027s just as you have said, Ramsey. I was impatient.\" \"I\u0027m the one who came up with the idea to follow Brisbane,\" Bridgid insisted. \"No, you didn\u0027t,\" Gillian countered. \"You told me that Anthony came up with the idea.\" Ramsey\u0027s roar stopped the discussion. \"What does Anthony have to do with this?\" Gillian realized then that Bridgid hadn\u0027t told her laird everything. \"Anthony told Bridgid that he would follow Brisbane.\" \"And?\" he demanded when she hesitated. \"He told me he did follow him,\" Bridgid said. \"He gave me specific directions, and I memorized them so we wouldn\u0027t get lost.\" \"He sent us into a trap.\" Ramsey was shaking with rage. \"I\u0027m going to kill the son of a bitch with my bare hands.\" \"No, you\u0027re not,\" Brodick countered. \"He tried to kill my wife. I\u0027m going to kill him. It\u0027s my right.\" \"The hell it is,\" Ramsey muttered. \"By God, he\u0027s going to suffer before he takes his last breath.\" Chapter Thirty It was late, well past midnight, and Bridgid and Gillian were so exhausted from their long day and their ordeal, they could barely keep their eyes open. They sat shoulder to shoulder with their backs resting against a tree trunk, their legs stretched out in front of them, trying to hear what their lairds were discussing. Everyone else had gone to sleep, and the ground was covered in a maze of plaids. Ramsey and Brodick sat in front of the fire with their heads bent, their whispered conversation grave. Ramsey continuously stirred the embers with a long, crooked stick as though looking for a forgotten object, while Brodick gazed at some distant point in the darkness, nodding every now and again at what Ramsey was saying. Gillian moved her head slightly and stared at Brodick\u0027s chiseled profile. She could see the tenseness in his shoulders, and though he sat motionless now, she felt as though he was about to spring. Bridgid nudged her and whispered, \"Ramsey thinks he\u0027s done a terrible injustice to the MacPhersons because he thought one of them was responsible for taking Alec Maitland. Does that make sense?\" \"Yes,\" Gillian answered. \"I\u0027ll explain later. Keep listening.\" \"I am,\" she whispered back, and a minute later she turned to Gillian again. \"He said that when he came home and challenged for the position of laird, he made an error in judgment by allowing the old guard to stay in place. He acted out of kindness, and that was a mistake.\" Bridgid continued to listen and after a while, Gillian nudged her again. \"Ramsey says he\u0027s going to stop procrastinating. He\u0027s… Oh, God.\" \"What?\" The look on Bridgid\u0027s face showed how devastated she was. \"He\u0027s going to marry Meggan MacPherson.\" Her voice trembled. \"Oh, Bridgid, he\u0027s the one, isn\u0027t he? He\u0027s the man you love.\" A tear slipped down her cheek. \" \u0027Tis true. I do love him, and I have for the longest time.\" Gillian took hold of her hand. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\" Bridgid wiped a tear from her eye. \"Men are stupid.\" \"Yes, they are,\" Gillian agreed. \"What\u0027s Brodick saying?\" \"He\u0027s trying to talk Ramsey out of it. He just advised him to think long and hard before he makes such a commitment.\" \"He didn\u0027t practice what he\u0027s now preaching,\" she whispered. \"And he\u0027s very upset with me.\" \"He must be,\" she replied. \"He just told Ramsey that marriage is a sacrifice.\" A minute later she whispered, \"Now that doesn\u0027t make sense.\" \"What?\" \"Ramsey said that in Brodick\u0027s case the sacrifice was worth it because he got the Englishmen\u0027s names. Do you know what he\u0027s talking about?\" Gillian was suddenly furious. \"Yes, I do. Is Ramsey saying he believes Brodick married me just to get the names of the Englishmen?\" \"What Englishmen?\" \"I\u0027ll explain later,\" she promised. \"Tell me. Is that what he says?\" Realizing how agitated her friend was, she hastened to answer. \"Yes, Ramsey did say that, and your husband just agreed.\" Gillian closed her eyes. \"I don\u0027t want to hear any more.\" \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Bridgid whispered. \"You can tell me. I\u0027m your dearest friend, aren\u0027t I?\" \"You\u0027re my only friend,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m not going to believe it.\" \"Believe what?\" \"That Brodick married me to get the names of the Englishmen. No, I won\u0027t believe it. No one would get married for such a reason. It\u0027s sinful.\" Bridgid thought about what Gillian had just said, and then whispered, \"Did these Englishmen insult one of the lairds?\" \"Insult? Oh, Bridgid, they did something much worse.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you this. You don\u0027t poke a bear in the eye and expect to walk away unscratched. They will get even. The men here never forget a wrong done to them, and they will go to great lengths to get what they want.\" \"I still refuse to believe that Brodick only married me to get the names. No, I won\u0027t believe it. Marriage is a holy sacrament, and he wouldn\u0027t… no, he wouldn\u0027t do that. He\u0027s speaking out of anger now. That\u0027s all there is to it.\" \"Did he ask you for the names of these Englishmen before you were married?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you didn\u0027t tell him?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" In frustration she added, \"And even after we were married, I made him promise he wouldn\u0027t retaliate until I had accomplished my task. Then I gave him the names. He gave me his word, and I trust him to keep it. I know he cares for me. He\u0027s just too stubborn to admit it. He told me he felt a responsibility for me.\" \"Of course he cares for you.\" \"Maybe Brodick will talk Ramsey out of marrying Meggan MacPherson.\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Ramsey sounded as though he\u0027d already made up his mind. He\u0027s putting the interests of the clan above his own, and that\u0027s as it should be because he\u0027s laird. He\u0027ll do what he thinks is right. I don\u0027t think I can stand watching him with her, though. I had already made up my mind to leave, and now I realize I must leave soon.\" \"Where will you go?\" Bridgid closed her eyes. \"I don\u0027t know. I cannot stay in the servants\u0027 quarters. The new mistress won\u0027t like it.\" \"Maybe your mother will let you come back home.\" \"No. She\u0027s made it clear she doesn\u0027t want me around. No one does,\" she added, knowing she sounded pitiful but too miserable to care. Dabbing a tear away from her eye, she whispered, \"The fall I took has made me weepy.\" Gillian pretended to believe that nonsense. Ramsey was the reason Bridgid was brokenhearted. She shifted her weight to ease the throbbing in her thigh and closed her eyes. She fell asleep accepting that Bridgid was right. Men were stupid. Chapter Thirty-One The first golden streaks of dawn were bursting onto the horizon when Brodick nudged Gillian awake. She had slept in his arms, though she had no memory of being moved during the night, and she was so sleepy she didn\u0027t want to cooperate. Snuggling under the blanket, she groaned, \"Not yet,\" and went back to sleep. Bridgid had also been moved to a plaid blanket closer to the fire. Another plaid covered her, and when Ramsey squatted down next to her and saw how peaceful she was, he regretted having to wake her. She really was lovely, he thought, noticing for the first time how long her eyelashes were and how pure her complexion was. Her lips were full, rosy, and without a thought as to what he was doing, he brushed his thumb across her lower lip. She batted his hand away as though he were a pest and grumbled something in her sleep he couldn\u0027t quite make out, but he was sure he heard the word \"stupid.\" \"Open your eyes, Bridgid. It\u0027s time to get going.\" She didn\u0027t wake up happy. \"Do leave me alone,\" she mumbled. Brodick stood over Gillian, wondering why the hell she wouldn\u0027t obey him, and once again ordered her to get up. \"Maybe we ought to throw them in the creek,\" Ramsey suggested. \"That will wake them up.\" Bridgid took the threat to heart and sat up. Shocked to find Ramsey so close to her, she leaned back on her elbows to put some distance between them. She knew she looked a sight. Her hair hung down over her eyes, and she squinted up at him, wondering how he could look so incredibly… perfect… at this ungodly hour of the morning. Brodick pulled Gillian to her feet but didn\u0027t let go of her until he was certain she could walk. Her leg stung with each movement, but she suffered in silence, knowing that if she gave a single complaint, she\u0027d hear another blistering lecture about her reckless behavior.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-49.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
