He went into the great hall and pulled the tapestries back from the two windows near the entrance. Light flooded the room.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s around here somewhere,\" Iain said, trying not to become alarmed.\\n\\n \"The guards would have seen him if he\u0027d ventured outside.\"\\n\\n Ramsey said. \"Where the hell is he?\"\\n\\n Ramsey was obviously concerned, but Brodick, on the other hand, wasn\u0027t the least fazed.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s with Gillian.\"\\n\\n Both Ramsey and Iain looked at their friend. \"Why would he be with Gillian?\" Iain asked as he rushed back up the stairs.\\n\\n \"He feels safe with her.\"\\n\\n Iain whirled around. \"And he doesn\u0027t feel safe with his mother and his father?\"\\n\\n Brodick started up the stairs. \"Of course he does, but he knows she\u0027ll let him in her bed. He\u0027s sleeping with her, and you aren\u0027t going in her room unless I\u0027m with you.\"\\n\\n \"For the love of…\" Iain didn\u0027t finish his thought. He strode down the hallway, and without bothering to knock, opened Gillian\u0027s door. The room was dark, Brodick brushed past him and went to the window. He lifted the tapestry, tied it with the cord hooked to the wall, and then turned around.\\n\\n Alec was in her bed all right, just as Brodick had predicted. He was cuddled up against her, his head resting on her shoulder. Gillian was sleeping on her back with her right arm wrapped around the little boy as though she were trying to protect him, even in sleep. Her other arm was stretched across the bed, palm up, and in the light, the scars and raw abrasions were startling to see.\\n\\n Ramsey stood in the doorway, and though usually diplomatic, he reverted to the days when Brodick\u0027s manners had rubbed off on him. \"What the hell happened to her arm? It\u0027s a mess.\"\\n\\n Fortunately, he\u0027d whispered the comment and hadn\u0027t disturbed Gillian or Alec.\\n\\n Brodick pulled the tapestry back in place so that the sun wouldn\u0027t bother them, and nudged Iain to leave.\\n\\n Iain didn\u0027t budge. \"One angel protects another,\" he whispered. He turned then and went into the hallway. \"We will do what she asks,\" he told Ramsey.\\n\\n \"We wait to retaliate?\" Ramsey asked, already frowning over that possibility.\\n\\n \"Yes, we wait.\"\\n\\n Brodick was still in the bedchamber. He\u0027d spotted his plaid on the chair, picked it up, and covered Gillian and Alec with the Buchanan colors. He looked at her once again as he was pulling the door closed and felt a strange contentment wash over him. It suddenly dawned on him that he was never going to let her go.\\n\\n Like it or not, she was going to belong to him.\\n\\n Gillian awakened an hour after dawn and felt thoroughly rested. She washed and dressed with care in her own clothes. The servants must have washed her gowns last night and then hung them in front of the fire, for they were dry and spotless.\\n\\n The tunic she wore over her pale yellow gown was a deep, emerald green that her uncle had often told her enhanced the color of her eyes. After securing the braided cord around her waist so that it would droop just so on the tilt of her hips, she brushed her hair, pinched her cheeks for color, and went downstairs.\\n\\n She ate breakfast with Judith and the boys. Graham begged his mother to let him take Michael and Alec to the field to watch the soldiers training, and after she gave her permission, they grabbed the wooden swords they would spar with and went running out the door.\\n\\n \"Now we can talk,\" Judith said. \"Did you sleep well? You\u0027re up early. I was sure you\u0027d stay in bed until noon at the very least. You have to be exhausted.\"\\n\\n \"I did sleep well,\" she replied. \"And I wanted to get up early. I must leave today.\"\\n\\n \"Leave us so soon?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she replied.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\"\\n\\n \"Home with Ramsey.\"\\n\\n Judith\u0027s eyes widened. \"Does Brodick know?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet. Do you know where he is?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s down at the stables with Iain and Ramsey. Would you mind if I tagged along? I really would like to see Brodick\u0027s reaction to hearing you want to leave with Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"Why would he object? He knows I have to search for my sister, and he also knows she\u0027s a MacPherson, so he surely understands I have to go to the Sinclair holding to look for her.\"\\n\\n \"With Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you look so incredulous? Do you know Winslow acted the very same way last night when I mentioned I\u0027d be going home with Ramsey today. He also asked me if Brodick knew about my plans. It was most peculiar.\"\\n\\n \"I can see I\u0027m going to have to explain.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, please,\" Gillian said.\\n\\n \"Ramsey and Iain and Brodick are like brothers,\" she began. \"And they are extremely loyal to one another. But surely you\u0027ve noticed in the time you\u0027ve been with Brodick that he\u0027s a very possessive man. All the Buchanans are,\" she added with a nod.\\n\\n \"What are you trying to tell me?\"\\n\\n Judith sighed. \"When Iain and I were newly married, my husband didn\u0027t like it when Ramsey was near me.\"\\n\\n \"Why? Didn\u0027t he trust him?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, he trusted him all right, and so does Brodick, but women, you see, tend to lose their heads over Ramsey. You\u0027ve got to admit he\u0027s a handsome devil.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but so are Iain and Brodick.\"\\n\\n \"Iain was a bit… insecure… but after a while, he calmed down because he knew my heart belonged to him. Brodick doesn\u0027t know, you see, and he\u0027s therefore going to be difficult about you leaving with Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t be difficult,\" Gillian assured her.\\n\\n Judith laughed. \"You think you know him so well, then?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do,\" she said.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s also a little rivalry between Ramsey and Brodick. It should have caused a rift, but it didn\u0027t. As I told you last night, about eight years ago, the two of them went to England to find brides. What I didn\u0027t tell you is that Brodick found a woman he thought might do.\"\\n\\n \"What happened?\" she asked when her friend hesitated and began to blush.\\n\\n \"This woman gave herself to Brodick.\"\\n\\n \"They were betrothed?\"\\n\\n Judith shook her head. \"No, but she gave herself to him. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean she took him to her bed?\"\\n\\n Their voices had dropped to whispers and they were both blushing now.\\n\\n \"Knowing Brodick as I do, I\u0027d say he took her to his bed, but she had to have agreed or he wouldn\u0027t have touched her.\"\\n\\n \"And he told you this?\"\\n\\n Gillian looked flabbergasted. Judith laughed as she answered, \"Good Lord, no, he didn\u0027t tell me. Iain did, but it took a good six months of nagging to get my husband to finally confide in me. You mustn\u0027t ever let the men know I\u0027ve told you this story. Promise me.\"\\n\\n \"I promise,\" Gillian hastily agreed so she could hear the rest of the tale. \"What happened to the woman? Brodick is a very honorable man and he wouldn\u0027t take an innocent—\"\\n\\n \"But she wasn\u0027t innocent,\" Judith whispered. \"She had been with other men.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear,\" Gillian whispered, thinking that it was a pity the woman was English.\\n\\n \"One of the men happened to be Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" Judith whispered. \"I don\u0027t want the servants to overhear.\"\\n\\n \"Both of them took her to their beds?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but neither knew for a time that she was playing one against the other.\"\\n\\n Gillian\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"No wonder Brodick dislikes the English so. What happened when they figured it all out?\"\\n\\n \"Neither one of them wanted her, of course. They came home and vowed they would marry one of their own or not marry at all.\"\\n\\n \"Did Brodick love her?\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that he did,\" she replied. \"If he\u0027d loved her, he would have been furious with Ramsey, but as it was, he was barely bothered.\"\\n\\n \"What about Ramsey?\"\\n\\n \"He took it all in stride. Women throw themselves at him,\" she added. \"And that\u0027s why Brodick will be difficult about your leaving with him.\"\\n\\n \"You told me he trusts Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s you he\u0027ll be concerned about,\" Judith told her bluntly. \"As I said before, women tend to lose their heads over Ramsey.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027ll be concerned that I… oh, for heaven\u0027s sake,\" Gillian cried out, and then laughed. \"You\u0027re wrong, Judith. Brodick won\u0027t care one way or another.\"\\n\\n Judith stood up. \"Shall we go find out?\"\\n\\n The two women walked side by side down the hill. The lairds were easy to spot, for they stood together beyond the stables, like towering trees in the center of a field, as they observed the soldiers sparring with their swords.\\n\\n All three turned as the two ladies came toward them. Gillian noticed that Iain couldn\u0027t seem to take his eyes off his wife. Love obviously hadn\u0027t lessened in the years they had lived as man and wife. \"Gillian has something to tell you,\" Judith announced.\\n\\n \"Laird,\" she began.\\n\\n \"Iain,\" he corrected.\\n\\n With a quick nod, she began again. \"Iain, I would first thank you for your kindness and your hospitality.\"\\n\\n \"It is I who should be thanking you, Gillian, for bringing my son home to me.\"\\n\\n \"She wants to go home with Ramsey, and I think she should,\" Judith announced emphatically so that her husband would know she supported Gillian\u0027s plan. \"She wants to leave today.\"\\n\\n \"Is that so?\" Iain replied with a glance at Brodick.\\n\\n \"Ramsey, did you plan to go home today?\"\\n\\n \"I did,\" he answered, and she noticed he, too, looked at Brodick.\\n\\n \"I know how important it is for you to find the man who betrayed Ramsey.\"\\n\\n Iain interrupted. \"He betrayed all of us, lass.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She hurriedly agreed so she could explain her position before she lost her nerve. Telling the giants what they were going to do took courage, especially when she was standing so close to them. She wanted to get the speech she\u0027d rehearsed with Judith on the way down the hill said as quickly as possible.\\n\\n \"I have until the fall festival to accomplish what I came here to do, which means I don\u0027t have much time. I\u0027m going to find my sister, God willing, and since she\u0027s one of the MacPhersons and the MacPhersons are now part of Ramsey\u0027s clan, I\u0027m going home with him today to start searching. I expect all of you to cooperate.\"\\n\\n After giving her speech, she folded her arms across her waist and tried to look confident.\\n\\n \"I see your mind\u0027s set,\" Iain said dryly. \"We expected you would want to go to Ramsey\u0027s holding.\"\\n\\n \"You had me worried for nothing,\" she whispered to Judith.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see,\" Judith whispered back.\\n\\n \"Ramsey, what say you? Will you take Gillian home with you today?\" Iain asked.\\n\\n \"We can leave immediately if that is Lady Gillian\u0027s wish.\"\\n\\n \"What about you, Brodick?\" Judith asked. \"What do you think of Gillian\u0027s plan to go home with Ramsey?\"\\n\\n Gillian didn\u0027t give him time to answer. \"Brodick\u0027s going to come with me,\" she blurted out. \"Is that right?\" he asked quietly.\\n\\n Her heart was suddenly pounding a furious beat and she could barely catch her breath. She realized then that she was in a panic, and it was all because she was terrified Brodick would leave her. Dear God, why and how had she allowed herself to become so attached to him in such a short time? She knew she shouldn\u0027t involve him in her problems, and yet the thought of watching him walk away from her knowing she would never see him again was simply unbearable.\\n\\n \"The Buchanans are feuding with the MacPhersons,\" Judith whispered softly. \"I think perhaps you ask too much of Brodick.\"\\n\\n \"She has yet to ask me anything,\" Brodick said. \"Judith, the Buchanans aren\u0027t feuding with the MacPhersons.\" Iain corrected his wife\u0027s misconception. \"They just don\u0027t like them. They don\u0027t like anyone they perceive as a weakling.\"\\n\\n \"Not everyone can be as strong as you are, Brodick. You should defend the weak, not trample on them,\" Gillian said.\\n\\n All three lairds grinned as they glanced at one another, and it dawned on her then that they were actually amused by her attitude. They obviously thought she was naive. \"Is this not so?\" she challenged.\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t so,\" Brodick answered. \"The weak don\u0027t survive in the Highlands.\"\\n\\n Both Ramsey and Iain nodded their agreement. \"The MacPhersons are leeches,\" Brodick said, addressing his remarks to Ramsey now. \"They\u0027ll drain the strength out of all the Sinclairs, including you. They like being taken care of,\" he added. \"And they sure as certain don\u0027t want to be strong. Once they\u0027ve used up and destroyed you, they\u0027ll simply go to another compassionate laird and beg him to take them in.\"\\n\\n \"You make compassion sound like a sin,\" Gillian said.\\n\\n \"In this instance it is,\" he answered.\\n\\n \"Ramsey has only been laird for a short time, but he\u0027s already earned the reputation of a compassionate man,\" Iain remarked. \"That\u0027s why the MacPhersons came to him.\"\\n\\n \"I, too, have little tolerance for a fit man who would deliberately embrace sloth and let others take care of him and his family. However, I think you\u0027re both mistaken about the MacPhersons. Their soldiers are poorly trained, and that is all there is to it. They aren\u0027t weak; they\u0027re inept.\"\\n\\n The discussion continued, but a movement to the east caught Gillian\u0027s attention. There were four young ladies standing together near the tree line watching the lairds. All of them were busy primping. One redheaded woman kept pinching her cheeks, while the others groomed their hair and smoothed their skirts. All of them were giggling. Their carefree attitude made Gillian smile. She assumed the women wanted to look their best when they spoke to Laird Maitland, but were politely waiting until he was no longer engaged in conversation.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s exactly our concern, Ramsey,\" Iain said. \"You\u0027ll train the MacPhersons, and then they\u0027ll turn on you.\"\\n\\n \"Fortunately, Iain and I won\u0027t let them destroy you,\" Brodick said. \"If you won\u0027t watch your back, we will.\"\\n\\n \"I know what I\u0027m doing,\" Ramsey announced authoritatively. \"And you will both stay out of my affairs.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think it was a MacPherson that Gillian saw? Could one of them be your traitor?\" Judith asked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-28.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
