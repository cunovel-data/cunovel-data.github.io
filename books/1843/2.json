{"id":76857,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"William desperately tried to enfold the child as their bodies plummeted down the jagged steps, but he couldn\u0027t shield her completely, and Gillian\u0027s chin struck the sharp stone.\\n\\n Stunned by the blow, she slowly sat up and looked about her. Blood poured onto her gown, and when she saw the blood on her hands, she began to scream. Her sister lay beside her, facedown on the floor, not making a sound.\\n\\n \"Christen, help me,\" Gillian sobbed. \"Wake up. I don\u0027t like it here. Wake up.\"\\n\\n William struggled to his feet with the hysterical child and, holding her tight against his chest, ran through the tunnel. \"Hush, child, hush,\" he whispered over and over again.\\n\\n Lawrence followed with Christen. Blood trickled down from the cut high on her forehead.\\n\\n \"Lawrence, you and Tom take Christen on to the creek. Spencer and I will meet you there,\" William shouted.\\n\\n \"Come with us now,\" Lawrence urged over Gillian\u0027s screams.\\n\\n \"The child\u0027s in a bad way. She needs stitches,\" William called back. \"Go now. We\u0027ll catch up with you. God\u0027s speed,\" he added as he rushed ahead.\\n\\n \"Christen,\" Gillian screamed. \"Christen, don\u0027t leave me.\"\\n\\n When they neared the door, William cupped his hand over Gillian\u0027s mouth and pleaded with her to be quiet. He and Spencer took her to the tanner\u0027s cottage on the edge of the outer bailey so that Maude, the tanner\u0027s wife, could sew the injury. The underside of Gillian\u0027s chin was completely flayed open.\\n\\n Both soldiers held the child down while Maude worked on her. The battle raged dangerously close, and the noise became so deafening they had to shout to be heard.\\n\\n \"Finish with the child,\" William ordered the woman. \"We must get her to. safety before it\u0027s too late. Hurry,\" he shouted as he rushed outside to stand guard.\\n\\n Maude tied a knot in the string, then clipped the threads. As quickly as she could manage, she wrapped a thick bandage around Gillian\u0027s neck and chin.\\n\\n Spencer lifted the little girl and followed William outside. The enemy had set fire to the thatched roofs of several of the huts with their flaming arrows, and in the bright light, the three ran toward the hill where their mounts waited.\\n\\n They were halfway up the incline when a troop of soldiers came swarming over the crest. More of the enemy cut off their retreat at the bottom. Escape was impossible, but the two valiant men still held steadfast to their duty. With Gillian on the ground between them, their legs the only barrier shielding her from the attack, they stood with their backs to each other, raised their swords high, and rendered their final battle cry. The two noble soldiers died as they had lived, with honor and courage protecting the innocent.\\n\\n One of Alford\u0027s commanders, recognizing the child, carried her back to the great hall. Liese, Gillian\u0027s maid, spotted her when she came inside with the soldier and boldly broke away from the group of servants huddled together in the corner under the watchful eye of the enemy\u0027s guard. She pleaded with the soldier to let her take over the care of the little girl. Fortunately, the commander considered Gillian a nuisance and was happy to be rid of her. He ordered Liese to take Gillian upstairs and then ran back outside to join in the fight.\\n\\n Gillian appeared to be in a stupor. Liese grabbed her and raced up the stairs and across the balcony toward the child\u0027s room to get away from the massacre. Panic seized her as she reached for the door latch. She was clawing at it and silently crying when a sudden crash made her jump. She turned just as the heavy oak doors leading to the great hall burst open and soldiers poured inside with their bloody battle axes raised and their swords drawn. Crazed with power, they swung their weapons against the weak and the defenseless. The unarmed men and women held their hands up as shields in a pitiful attempt to ward off the enemy\u0027s razor sharp swords. It was a needless slaughter. Horrified, Liese fell to her knees, closed her eyes, and covered her ears so she wouldn\u0027t see or hear her friends\u0027 desperate pleas for mercy.\\n\\n Gillian stood passively next to Liese, but when she saw her father being dragged inside, she ran to the banister rail and knelt down. \"Papa,\" she whispered, and then she saw a man in a gold cape raise his sword over her father. \"Papa!\" she screamed.\\n\\n Those were the last words she spoke. From that moment, Gillian retreated into a world of numb silence.\\n\\n Two weeks later, the young man who had seized control of her father\u0027s holding, Baron Alford the Red of Lockmiere, called her before him to decide what was to be done with her, and without speaking a single word, she let him know what was in her mind and her heart.\\n\\n Liese held Gillian\u0027s hand and walked into the great hall to meet the monster who had killed the child\u0027s father. Alford, barely old enough to be called a man, was an evil, power-hungry demon, and Liese was no fool. She knew that with the snap of his fingers or a wave of his hand, he could order both their deaths.\\n\\n Gillian jerked away from Liese just inside the entrance and walked forward alone. She stopped when she reached the long table where Alford and his young companions dined. Without a hint of expression on her face, and with her hands hanging limply at her sides, she stood motionless, staring vacantly at the baron.\\n\\n He had a pheasant leg in one hand and a wedge of black bread in the other. Specks of grease and meat clung to the red scraggy stubble on his chin. He ignored the child for several minutes while he devoured his food, and after he had tossed the bones over his shoulder, he turned to her.\\n\\n \"How old are you, Gillian?\" Alford waited a full minute before trying again. \"I asked you a question,\" he muttered, trying to control his rising temper.\\n\\n \"She cannot be more than four years old,\" one of his friends volunteered.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d wager she\u0027s past five,\" his cohort suggested. \"She\u0027s small, but she could even be six.\"\\n\\n Alford raised his hand for silence while his eyes continued to bore into the little girl. \"It\u0027s a simple question. Answer me, and while you\u0027re at it, tell me what you think I should do with you. My father\u0027s confessor believes you can\u0027t speak because the Devil has taken possession of your soul. He pleads the right to force the demon out, using very unpleasant methods. Would you like me to tell you exactly what he would do?\" he asked. \"No, I don\u0027t suppose you would,\" he added with a smirk. \"Torture will be necessary, of course, for it\u0027s the only way to get the demons out, or so I\u0027m told. Would you like to be strapped down to a table for hour upon hour while my confessor works on you? I have the power to order it done. Now answer my questions and be quick about it. Tell me your age,\" he demanded in a snarl.\\n\\n Silence was her response. Chilling silence. Alford could see that his threats didn\u0027t faze her. He thought she might be too simpleminded to understand. She was her father\u0027s daughter after all, and what a naive, stupid fool he had been to believe that Alford was his friend.\\n\\n \"Perhaps she isn\u0027t answering you because she doesn\u0027t know how old she is,\" his friend suggested. \"Get on with the important matter,\" he urged. \"Ask her about the box.\"\\n\\n Alford nodded agreement. \"Now, Gillian,\" he began, his tone as sour as vinegar, \"your father stole a very valuable box from Prince John, and I mean to get it back for him. There were pretty jewels on the top and sides of the case. If you saw it, you would remember it,\" he added. \"Did you or your sister see this treasure? Answer me,\" he ordered, his voice shrill with his frustration. \"Did you see your father hide the box? Did you?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t give any indication that she had heard a word he\u0027d said. She simply continued to look at him. The young baron let out a sigh of vexation, then decided to stare her into timidity.\\n\\n In the space of an indrawn breath, the child\u0027s expression changed from indifference to loathing. The hatred burning bright in her eyes quickly unnerved him and made the hair on the back of his neck stand up and the gooseflesh rise up on his forearms. It was unholy for a child of such tender years to show such intensity.\\n\\n She frightened him. Infuriated by his own bizarre reaction to the girl who was little more than a baby, Alford resorted to cruelty once again. \"You\u0027re a sickly looking child, aren\u0027t you, with your pale skin and drab brown hair? Your sister was the pretty one, wasn\u0027t she? Tell me, Gillian, were you jealous of her? Is that why you pushed her down the stairs? The woman who sewed you up told me you and Christen both went down the stairs, and one of the soldiers who was with you told the woman you pushed your sister. Christen\u0027s dead, you know, and it\u0027s all your fault.\" He leaned forward and pointed a long, bony finger in her face. \"You\u0027re going to live with that black sin for the rest of your life, however short that might be. I\u0027ve decided to send you to the end of the earth,\" he added offhandedly. \"To the bitter, cold north of England where you will live with the heathens until the day comes that I have need for you again. Now get you out of my sight. You make my flesh crawl.\"\\n\\n Trembling with fear, Liese stepped forward. \"Milord, may I accompany the child north to look after her?\"\\n\\n Alford turned his attention to the maid cowering near the entrance and openly cringed at the sight of her scarred face. \"One witch to look after another?\" he scoffed. \"I don\u0027t care if you go or stay. Do what you will, but get her but of here now so that my friends and I will not have to suffer her fetid stare a moment longer.\"\\n\\n Hearing the tremor in his own voice sent Alford into a rage.\\n\\n He picked up a heavy wooden bowl from the table and hurled it at the child. It sailed past her head, narrowly missing her. Gillian neither flinched nor blinked. She simply continued to stand where she was, her green eyes glistening with hatred.\\n\\n Was she looking at his soul? The thought sent a shiver down Alford\u0027s spine.\\n\\n \"Out,\" he screamed. \"Get her out of here.\"\\n\\n Liese dashed forward to get Gillian, and then ran out of the hall.\\n\\n As soon as they were safely outside, she hugged the little girl to her bosom and whispered, \"It\u0027s over now and soon we will leave this foul place and never look back. You\u0027ll never have to see your father\u0027s murderer again, and I\u0027ll never have to look upon my husband, Ector. The two of us will make a new life together, and God willing, we\u0027ll find some peace and joy.\"\\n\\n Liese was determined to get away before Baron Alford changed his mind. Permission to leave Dunhanshire liberated her, for it meant she could leave Ector behind as well. Her husband had gone over the edge of sanity during the attack on the castle and was too befuddled to go anywhere. After witnessing the slaughter of most of the soldiers and the household staff and narrowly escaping with his own life intact, his mind had snapped and he had turned as crazy as a rabid fox, roaming the hills of Dunhanshire during the days with his dirty knapsack filled with the rocks and clumps of dirt he called his treasures. Each night he made his bed in the southeast corner of the stables, where he was left alone to stew in his own nightmares. His eyes had a glassy, faraway look to them, and he constantly alternated between muttering to himself about how he was going to be a rich man, as rich as King Richard himself, and shouting obscenities because it was taking him so long to get his due. Even the infidels and their leader, Alford, who now claimed Dunhanshire for themselves in the absent king\u0027s name, were superstitious enough to give Ector a wide path. As long as the demented man left them alone, they ignored him. Some of the younger soldiers, it was observed, dropped to their knees and made the sign of the cross whenever Ector passed by. The holy ritual was a talisman to ward off the possibility of catching the crazy loon\u0027s affliction. They didn\u0027t dare kill him, for they firmly believed that the demons controlling Ector\u0027s mind would leap into them and take control of their thoughts and actions.\\n\\n Liese felt that God had granted her a dispensation from her marriage vows. In the seven years that they had lived as man and wife, Ector had never shown her as much as an ounce of affection or spoken a kind word to her. He believed that it was his duty as a husband to beat her into submission and humility so that she would be assured a place in heaven, and he took on his sacred responsibility with a gleeful vengeance. A hard, angry man who as a child had been coddled and shamefully spoiled by doting parents, Ector presumed that he could have anything he wanted. He was convinced that he should live the life of leisure, and he let greed control his every thought. Just three months before Gillian\u0027s father was killed, Ector had been promoted to the coveted position of chief reeve because of his clever way with figures. He then had access to the vast amount of money collected in rents from the tenants and knew exactly how much the baron was worth. Avarice took hold of his heart, and with it came a bitterness as rancid as bile because he hadn\u0027t been rewarded with what he believed was his share.\\n\\n Ector was also a coward. During the attack, Liese witnessed her husband grab hold of Gerta, the household cook and Liese\u0027s dear friend, and use her as a shield against the arrows hailing down on them in the courtyard. When Gerta was killed, Ector had dragged her body over his and had pretended to be dead.\\n\\n The shame was unspeakable, and Liese could no longer look at her husband without hatred. She knew she was in jeopardy of losing her own soul, for to despise another of God\u0027s creatures the way she despised Ector was surely sinful. She thanked God for giving her a second chance to redeem herself.\\n\\n Concerned that Ector might take to the notion of following her, Liese, on the day she and Gillian were scheduled to leave, took the child with her to the stables to say good-bye. Clutching the little girl\u0027s hand in her own, she marched into the stall where her husband now made his home. She spotted his dung-and-blood-spattered knapsack hanging on the peg in the corner and turned her nose up in disgust. It smelled as foul as the man pacing about in front of her.\\n\\n When she called out to him, he flinched, then ran to grab his knapsack and hide it behind his back. His eyes darted back and forth as he crouched down almost to his knees.\\n\\n \"You old fool,\" she muttered. \"No one\u0027s going to steal your knapsack. I\u0027m here to tell you I\u0027m leaving Dunhanshire with Lady Gillian and I\u0027ll not ever see you again, praise the Lord. Do you hear what I\u0027m saying to you? Stop your mumbling and look at me. I don\u0027t want you coming after me. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n Ector let out a low snicker. Gillian squeezed closer to Liese and grabbed hold of her skirt. The woman immediately set about soothing her. \"Don\u0027t you let him scare you,\" she whispered. \"I won\u0027t let him do you any harm,\" she added before turning her attention and her repulsion to her husband again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m meaning what I say, Ector. Don\u0027t you dare try to follow me. I don\u0027t ever want to look upon you again. As far as I\u0027m concerned, you\u0027re dead and buried.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t appear to be paying any attention to her. \"I\u0027m getting my reward soon now… it\u0027s all going to be mine… a king\u0027s ransom,\" he boasted with a raucous snort. \"Just like I deserve… his kingdom for a ransom. It\u0027s going to be mine… all mine…\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-2.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
