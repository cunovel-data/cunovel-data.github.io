Besides, even if she were not your laird\u0027s bride, I wouldn\u0027t have dishonored her by trying to touch her. She is the most gentle of ladies.\"\\n\\n \"Balcher won\u0027t care about honor,\" Robert muttered.\\n\\n Dylan was annoyed. Robert and Aaron and Liam had suddenly turned into the lady\u0027s champions. \"Not five minutes ago you were outraged by this message,\" he reminded them. \"What has caused this change in attitude?\"\\n\\n \"The MacDonalds,\" Robert answered.\\n\\n \"Specifically Balcher,\" Aaron interjected.\\n\\n \"The lady belongs to Brodick and no other shall have her,\" Robert decreed.\\n\\n So ludicrous had the conversation become, Brodick couldn\u0027t hold back his smile. \"I have not claimed her,\" he reminded the warriors.\\n\\n \"But she has claimed you, Laird,\" Liam argued.\\n\\n \"And that makes it so?\" Dylan asked.\\n\\n Before anyone could answer, Brodick held up his hand for silence. \"I would ask one last question of this messenger, and I would like to be able to hear his answer.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Laird?\" Henley asked, shivering anew.\\n\\n \"You have told me that she called you to the window to speak to you, but you haven\u0027t told me what she said.\"\\n\\n \"She sent an additional message to you.\"\\n\\n \"A request?\" Aaron asked.\\n\\n Henley found his first smile. \"Nay,\u0027twas not a request but an order.\"\\n\\n \"She gives me an order?\" Brodick was astounded by the woman\u0027s temerity.\\n\\n Henley took a deep breath, hoping it wasn\u0027t going to be his last, and then blurted out, \"She commands you to hurry.\"\\n\\n Chapter Five\\n\\n Gillian was having second thoughts about her rash plan. She and Alec had waited in the abandoned church for almost twenty-four hours now, and that was surely long enough for the laird to reach her, if he had been so inclined.\\n\\n She felt ill and knew that if she sat down she probably wouldn\u0027t have enough strength to get back up again, and so she paced up and down the main aisle while she thought about their circumstances.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to have to leave soon,\" she told the little boy. \"We simply cannot continue to wait.\"\\n\\n Alec sat on a chair with his legs folded under him watching her.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t look so good, Gillian. Are you sick?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she lied. \"I\u0027m just weary.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\\n\\n \"You just ate.\"\\n\\n \"But then I threw up.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, because you ate too fast,\" she replied.\\n\\n She went to the back of the church, where she\u0027d placed her cloth satchel and the basket of food her dear friends the Hathaway brothers had stolen for her. She glanced out the window and saw Henry pacing about the clearing.\\n\\n \"What are you staring at?\" Alec asked.\\n\\n \"The Hathaways,\" she answered. \"I don\u0027t know what we would have done without them. Years ago they helped me get to my uncle\u0027s home. They were very courageous. Neither one of them thought twice about helping me again. I must find a way to repay them,\" she added.\\n\\n She handed Alec a wedge of cheese and a thick square of bread. \"Please eat slowly this time.\"\\n\\n He took a bite of the cheese and then asked, \"Uncle Brodick will be here soon, won\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Remember your manners, Alec. It isn\u0027t polite to talk with a mouth full of food.\"\\n\\n \"You know what?\" he asked, ignoring her criticism.\\n\\n \"No, what?\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t leave \u0027cause then Uncle Brodick will be mad when he gets here and can\u0027t find us. We got to wait for him.\"\\n\\n She sat down next to him on the chair. \"We\u0027ll give him one more hour, but that\u0027s all. All right?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I hate waiting.\"\\n\\n \"I do too,\" she admitted.\\n\\n \"Gillian? What are you gonna do if you can\u0027t find your sister?\"\\n\\n \"I will find her,\" she countered. \"I must.\"\\n\\n \"You got to find that box too,\" he said. \"I heard the baron tell you so.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. The box disappeared years ago.\"\\n\\n \"But you told the baron you knew where it was.\"\\n\\n \"I lied,\" she said. \"It was all I could think of at the time to get him to leave you alone. My father gave the box to my sister to take with her. There was an accident…\"\\n\\n \"But how come the baron wants the old box, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s extremely valuable, and it\u0027s also the key to a mystery that happened a long time ago. Would you like to hear the story?\"\\n\\n \"Is it scary?\"\\n\\n \"A little. Do you still want to hear it?\"\\n\\n He eagerly nodded. \"I like scary stories.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"All right then, I\u0027ll tell you. It seems that before John was King—\"\\n\\n \"He was a prince.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he was, and he was madly in love with a young lady named Arianna. She was said to be very beautiful—\"\\n\\n \"As beautiful as you?\"\\n\\n The question took her aback. \"You think me beautiful?\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"Thank you, but Arianna was far more beautiful than any other lady in the kingdom. She had golden hair that shimmered in the sunlight—\"\\n\\n \"Did she get sick and die?\"\\n\\n \"No, she didn\u0027t get sick, but she did die.\"\\n\\n \"Did she just up and keel over the way Angus did?\"\\n\\n \"No, she—\"\\n\\n \"Then what happened to her?\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"I\u0027ll get this story told much quicker if you stop interrupting me. Now then, where was I? Oh, yes, as I was saying, Prince John was smitten with the beautiful woman—\"\\n\\n \"What does\u0027smitten\u0027 mean?\"\\n\\n \"It means he was taken with her. He liked her.\" She rushed on when she saw he was about to interrupt her again. \"She was his first true love, and he wanted to marry her. Have you ever heard of Saint Columba\u0027s box?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"A jeweled case that belongs to the Scots,\" she explained. \"A long, long time ago, the sacred remains of Saint Columba were put inside the case—\"\\n\\n \"What are\u0027remains\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Fragments of bones,\" she answered. \"Now, as I was saying, the remains were placed inside the box, and the Scots carried it into battle with them.\"\\n\\n \"How come they wanted to carry bones into battle?\"\\n\\n \"They believed that having the case with them would bring them victory over their enemies.\"\\n\\n \"Did it?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" she said. \"The practice of carrying the box into battle is still going on. They don\u0027t take the box into every single battle, just some,\" she added.\\n\\n \"How come you know about the box?\"\\n\\n \"My Uncle Morgan told me about it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s the Lowlanders who carry the box, not the Highlanders.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you say that?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Cause Highlanders don\u0027t need a box when they fight. They always win \u0027cause they\u0027re stronger and meaner. You know what my Uncle Ennis says?\"\\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027m guessing he said something outrageous.\"\\n\\n \"He says when English soldiers see more than three Highlanders riding toward them, they drop their swords and run away like scared rabbits.\"\\n\\n \"Not all Englishmen are like the baron. Most are quite courageous,\" she insisted.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t interested in her defense of the English. \"Aren\u0027t you going to tell me what happened to the pretty lady and King John?\" After asking the question, he turned and spit on the ground.\\n\\n She ignored his crude behavior and continued on with the tale. \"John took a fancy to the story of the Scottish jeweled box and decided to create a legend of his own. He commissioned his artisan—\"\\n\\n \"What does \u0027commissioned\u0027 mean?\"\\n\\n \"He ordered his artisan,\" she qualified, \"to make a beautiful jeweled box for him. John has always loved being clever and cunning, and so he also decreed that he would be the only one who knew how to open the box. The artisan took over a year to complete the design and build the box, and when it was finally finished, it was said to be quite grand. It was impossible to tell which was the top and which was the bottom, though, because there were no visible latches or keyholes. The entire exterior was covered in a series of gold strips that crisscrossed, with sapphires as blue as the sky on a sunny day and emeralds as green as—\"\\n\\n \"Your eyes?\" he eagerly guessed.\\n\\n \"And there were rubies too, bright red rubies—\"\\n\\n \"As red as blood?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" she allowed. \"All the precious jewels were set between the golden crisscrosses. Only John knew where to press to get the box to open.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true. The man who made the box knows how to open it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s exactly what John realized,\" she said. \"And so he did a terrible thing. He ordered the artisan\u0027s death.\"\\n\\n \"Did King John\"—he paused to spit again before continuing his question—\"kill the pretty lady and put her bones in his box?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no, the box was much too small,\" she explained. \"Besides, John only wanted a lock of Arianna\u0027s hair because he was certain she would bring him good fortune when he went into battle. He opened the box, put his jeweled dagger inside, and then ordered his squire to take the box to Lady Arianna\u0027s chamber with specific orders that she put a lock of her golden hair into his golden box.\"\\n\\n \"Then what happened?\"\\n\\n \"Lady Arianna received the open box and the dagger from the squire. He went into her chamber and placed it on the table, then took his leave. He later told the prince that she was the only person inside the room. Not even her lady\u0027s maid was present.\"\\n\\n \"I know what happened next. She stole the box and the jeweled dagger, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n Gillian smiled over the child\u0027s enthusiasm. \"No, she didn\u0027t steal the box. According to the story, when John\u0027s squire left her chamber, he heard her lock the door. He returned later to get the box for the prince, but Lady Arianna wouldn\u0027t answer his summons. John then went to her chamber.\"\\n\\n \"Did she let him in?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Did she tell him to go away?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she answered. \"Not a sound could be heard from the room. John has always been known for his impatience. It didn\u0027t take long for him to become very angry because she refused to answer him, and so he ordered his soldiers to break the door down. They used their hatchets. John went rushing inside and he was the one who found her. Poor Lady Arianna was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. Someone had stabbed her.\"\\n\\n \"Then did John put her bones in his box?\"\\n\\n \"No, he didn\u0027t. Remember I told you the box was far too small to hold her bones. Besides, neither the box nor the dagger was there. They had disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d they go?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s the mystery.\"\\n\\n \"Who killed the pretty lady?\"\\n\\n \"No one knows. John ordered his soldiers to search the kingdom for the box, but it had vanished into thin air. He believes that whoever stole the box murdered his own true love. Uncle Morgan told me that every couple of years a rumor surfaces that Arianna\u0027s box has been seen, and John renews his efforts to find it. The reward he\u0027s offered is staggeringly high, but to this day it hasn\u0027t been claimed.\"\\n\\n \"You know what?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"The lady\u0027s better off dead than married to King John.\" After making his comment, he once again turned away from her and spit on the floor.\\n\\n \"Why are you doing that?\"\\n\\n \"I got to,\" he replied. \"Whenever we say his name, we got to spit. It\u0027s a sign of how we feel.\"\\n\\n She was both appalled and amused at the same time. \"Do you mean to tell me that everyone in the Highlands spits each time one of them says King John\u0027s name?\"\\n\\n \"Some curse, but Mama won\u0027t let me.\"\\n\\n \"I should hope not.\"\\n\\n \"Brodick curses when he\u0027s got to say your king\u0027s name. Are you gonna tell him to stop?\" After asking the question, he began to giggle.\\n\\n The sound proved infectious, and she lightly tapped him on the bridge of his nose. \"You are the dearest little boy,\" she whispered. \"But you do ask the most bizarre questions.\"\\n\\n \"But will you tell Brodick to stop?\" he prodded.\\n\\n She rolled her eyes heavenward. \"Should he ever happen to say King John\u0027s name and then curse—or spit,\" she added, \"I would, of course, order him to stop.\"\\n\\n He burst into laughter. \"You\u0027re gonna be sorry if you try to tell him what to do. He won\u0027t like it,\" he said. \"I wish he\u0027d hurry up and get here.\"\\n\\n \"I do too.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you should have sent the dagger like you were going to,\" he said. \"How come you changed your mind?\"\\n\\n \"If I sent Brodick the dagger he gave you, he would know the reason I wanted to see him had something to do with you, but then I worried that someone else might see the dagger, and it was simply too risky. I don\u0027t know who to trust.\"\\n\\n \"But you saw the traitor riding down the path,\" he reminded her. \"You said you watched him from the hilltop while I was sleeping.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I did see him, but remember what I told you? We aren\u0027t going to let anyone know about that.\"\\n\\n \"Not even Brodick?\"\\n\\n \"No, not even Brodick.\"\\n\\n \"How much longer do we have to wait?\"\\n\\n She patted his hand. \"I think we\u0027ve waited as long as we can. He isn\u0027t going to come for us, but I don\u0027t want you to worry. We\u0027ll find another way to get you home.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Cause you promised, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, because I promised. What was I thinking? It was a foolish idea to tell that MacDonald soldier I was Brodick\u0027s bride.\"\\n\\n \"But maybe Brodick needs a bride. He might come for us.\"\\n\\n \"I should have offered him gold.\"\\n\\n Alec snorted. \"Brodick doesn\u0027t care about gold.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"It\u0027s just as well because I don\u0027t have any.\"\\n\\n His eyes widened. \"You would lie to Uncle Brodick?\"\\n\\n \"I lied about being his bride.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s gonna be angry when he gets here, but I won\u0027t let him shout at you.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you. You aren\u0027t still angry with me, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I was,\" he admitted. \"But now I\u0027m not.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-13.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
