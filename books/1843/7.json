You do want them, don\u0027t you?\"\n He nodded. \"Yes.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"All warriors have scars. They\u0027re marks of valor.\"\n He was so serious she didn\u0027t dare laugh. \"Do you know what valor is?\"\n He shook his head. \"I know it\u0027s good.\"\n \"Yes,\" she agreed. \"Valor is courage, and that is very good indeed. I imagine those cuts sting,\" she added as she leaned forward to pull his tunic down over his belly. \"When we\u0027re taken back to the holding, I\u0027ll ask one of the servants to put some salve on your fingers and chest and stomach, and then you\u0027ll feel much better. Some of the older women remember me,\" she added. \"They\u0027ll help us.\"\n \"But we can\u0027t go back,\" he cried out.\n The change in him was so abrupt it startled her. \"Try to understand,\" she said. \"We\u0027re trapped here. This ledge doesn\u0027t go anywhere.\"\n \"I could crawl to the end and see if—\"\n \"No,\" she interrupted. \"The rock might not be sturdy enough to hold your weight. Can\u0027t you see how it thins out near the curve?\"\n \"But I could—\"\n \"I cannot let you take such a chance.\"\n Tears came into his eyes. \"I don\u0027t want to go back. I want to go home.\"\n She nodded in sympathy. \"I know you do and I want to help you get back home. I\u0027ll find a way,\" she promised. \"I give you my word.\" He didn\u0027t seem convinced. He relaxed against her and yawned loudly. \"Do you know what my Uncle Ennis says? If an Englishman gives you his word, you\u0027ll come away with nothing.\"\n \"I really must meet this uncle of yours one day and set him straight about a few matters.\"\n He snorted. \"He wouldn\u0027t talk to you,\" he said. \"Leastways I don\u0027t think he would. Gillian?\" he asked then. \"I know I was supposed to wait in the stables for you, but then that man came inside and I got scared and ran.\"\n \"Do you mean the baron went into the stables?\"\n \"The ugly man with the red beard.\"\n \"That\u0027s the baron,\" she said. \"Did he see you?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think so. When I was hiding in the trees, I seen him leave with two other men. Maybe they won\u0027t ever come back.\"\n \"Oh, they\u0027ll come back all right,\" she said, for she didn\u0027t want to give the boy false hope. \"If not tomorrow, then the day after.\"\n The child\u0027s wrinkled brow made him seem too wise for his young years, and that saddened her. Little boys should be outside running and laughing and playing silly tricks with their friends. This little one had been plucked away from his family to be used as a pawn in Baron Alford\u0027s scheme. The child had to feel as though he\u0027d been dropped into the middle of a nightmare.\n \"Are you still afraid, Gillian?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I never get afraid,\" he boasted.\n \"You don\u0027t?\"\n \"Almost never,\" he corrected.\n \"How old are you?\"\n \"Almost seven.\"\n \"Almost?\"\n \"I will be pretty soon.\"\n \"You\u0027re a very brave boy.\"\n \"I know,\" he said very matter-of-factly. \"How come those men stole me away from the festival? It was the first one I ever got to go to, and I was having a fine time. Was it because me and my friend was playing a trick on our families?\"\n \"No,\" she assured him. \"That wasn\u0027t the reason why.\"\n \"Did I do something… bad?\"\n \"Oh, no, you didn\u0027t do anything bad. None of this is your fault. You\u0027ve just been caught in the middle, that\u0027s all. The baron wants something from me, but he hasn\u0027t told me what it is yet, and you\u0027re somehow involved.\"\n \"I know what it is,\" he boasted. \"And you know what? The baron\u0027s gonna go to hell \u0027cause my papa will send him there. I miss my mama and papa,\" he admitted forlornly, his voice cracking on a sob.\n \"Yes, of course you do. They must be frantic, searching for you\".\n \"No, they aren\u0027t, \u0027cause you know why? They think I\u0027m dead.\"\n \"Why would they think such a thing?\"\n \"I heard the baron talking to his friends.\"\n \"Then you do know what the baron\u0027s plans are?\" she asked sharply.\n \"Maybe I do,\" he said. \"The men who took me made it look like I hit my head on the rocks and fell in the falls and drowned. That\u0027s what I heard them saying. I\u0027ll bet my mama\u0027s crying all the time.\"\n \"That poor woman…\"\n \"She\u0027s missing me fierce.\"\n \"Of course she is. But think how overjoyed she\u0027ll be to have you back home again. Now tell me, please, what else you heard the baron say to his friends,\" she asked, trying to sound as though the question wasn\u0027t terribly important so that he wouldn\u0027t become fretful.\n \"I heard everything they said \u0027cause you know why? I played a trick. The baron didn\u0027t know I understood \u0027cause I didn\u0027t talk, not even Gaelic, in front of him or the others.\"\n \"That was very clever of you.\" She could tell her praise pleased him. He grinned up at her while he laced his fingers through hers. \"Tell me everything you heard, and please take your time so you won\u0027t leave anything out.\"\n \"The baron lost a box a long time ago, but now he thinks he knows where it is. A man told him.\"\n \"What man? Did the baron say his name?\"\n \"No, but the man was dying when he told him. The box had a funny name too, but I can\u0027t remember it now.\"\n She suddenly felt sick to her stomach. She understood now why Alford had forced her back to Dunhanshire, and as the ramifications struck her full force, her eyes stung with tears.\n \"Arianna,\" she whispered. \"He called it Arianna\u0027s box, didn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said excitedly. \"How come you knew the name?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer him. Her mind was racing with questions. Oh, God, had Alford found Christen?\n \"How come you speak Gaelic?\"\n \"What?\" she asked sharply, startled by the abrupt change in topics.\n He repeated the question. \"Are you mad at me \u0027cause I asked?\"\n She could see the anxiety in his eyes. \"No, no, I\u0027m not mad,\" she assured him. \"I learned to speak Gaelic because my sister, Christen, lives in the Highlands and I—\"\n He interrupted her. \"Where in the Highlands?\"\n \"I\u0027m not exactly sure—\"\n \"But—\"\n She wouldn\u0027t let him interrupt her again. \"When I find out exactly where she is, I\u0027m going to go see her and I want to be able to speak to her in Gaelic.\"\n \"How come she\u0027s got a clan and gets to live in the Highlands and you don\u0027t?\"\n \"Because I got caught,\" she answered. \"A long time ago, when I was just a little girl, the baron and his soldiers seized Dunhanshire. My father tried to get my sister and me to safety, but in the chaos, Christen and I were separated.\"\n \"Is your sister lost?\"\n \"No, she isn\u0027t lost. She was taken north into the Lowlands by one of my father\u0027s loyal men. My Uncle Morgan went to great lengths to find out exactly where she was, but she had vanished into the Highlands. I\u0027m not sure where she is now, but I hope one day I will find her.\"\n \"Do you miss her?\"\n \"Yes, I do. I haven\u0027t seen Christen in a long time though. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll even recognize her. Uncle Morgan told me the family who took her might have changed her name to keep her safe.\"\n \"From the baron?\"\n \"Yes,\" she replied. \"Still, she\u0027ll remember me.\"\n \"But what if she doesn\u0027t?\"\n \"She will,\" she insisted.\n A long peaceful minute passed in silence before he spoke again. \"You know what?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I can speak your language real good \u0027cause my mama taught me how to talk to the English even though Papa didn\u0027t want her to and my papa only talks Gaelic to me. I don\u0027t even remember learning how. I just did.\"\n \"You\u0027re a very smart boy.\"\n \"That\u0027s what my mama says. Some Gaelic\u0027s hard to talk,\" he continued, \" \u0027cause clans got their own way of saying things and it takes a long time to learn all the different words. When Uncle Brodick talks to me, he has to talk my Gaelic or I wouldn\u0027t know what he was saying, but it wouldn\u0027t matter if you could understand what they were saying \u0027cause you know why? They wouldn\u0027t talk to you unless my uncle told them to.\"\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t they talk to me?\"\n He gave her a look that suggested she was just plain stupid. He was such an adorable little boy she had to fight the urge to hug him.\n \"\u0027Cause you\u0027re English,\" he explained in exasperation. \"It\u0027s gonna get dark,\" he worried out loud. \"Are you gonna be afraid of the dark the way you were afraid of looking down?\"\n \"No, I won\u0027t be afraid.\"\n He was trying to get her to put her arm around his shoulders but she wasn\u0027t taking the hint, and in frustration, he finally grabbed hold of her hand and did it for her.\n \"You smell like my mama.\"\n \"And how\u0027s that?\"\n \"Good.\"\n His voice cracked on the word, and she surmised he was getting homesick again.\n \"Maybe the baron won\u0027t find us.\"\n \"His soldiers will see the rope tied around the boulder,\" she gently reminded him.\n \"I don\u0027t want to go back.\"\n He burst into tears. She leaned over him and brushed his curls out of his eyes and kissed his forehead. \"Hush now, it\u0027s going to be all right. I promise you, I\u0027m going to find a way to get you back home.\"\n \"But you\u0027re just a lady,\" he wailed.\n She tried to think of something to ease his mind and give him hope. His sobs were breaking her heart, and in desperation, she blurted out, \"You know what a protector is, don\u0027t you?\"\n He hiccuped while he answered. \"It\u0027s the same as a champion.\" He sat up and mopped the tears away from his cheeks with his fists. \"I had me a protector, and then I got another one. The day I was born I got one \u0027cause every bairn born in our clan gets to have one. He\u0027s supposed to look out for the boy or girl all his life long to make sure nothing bad ever happens to him. Angus used to be my champion, but then he died.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sure Angus was a fine protector.\"\n She was getting weary, and it was difficult to keep up with the idle chatter. Her arm was throbbing and felt as though it had been held over a flaming torch. As exhausted as she was from the long trip back to Dunhanshire, she still was determined to keep the boy occupied with conversation until he became too sleepy to worry.\n \"I just got me a new champion,\" he told her. \"Papa had to ponder it a long time \u0027cause he wanted to make sure he picked the right one for me. He told me he wanted me to have a champion as strong and fierce as Graham\u0027s.\"\n \"Who is Graham?\" she asked.\n \"My brother,\" he answered.\n \"And who did your father choose for you?\"\n \"His friend,\" he answered. \"He\u0027s a fierce warrior, an important laird too, and you know what?\"\n She smiled. \"What?\"\n \"He\u0027s awful mean. That\u0027s the best part. Papa says he\u0027ll make a fine champion.\"\n \"Because he\u0027s mean?\"\n \"And \u0027cause he\u0027s strong,\" he explained. \"He can split a tree in half just by glaring at it. Uncle Ennis told me so. He\u0027s only mean when he\u0027s got to be.\"\n \"Your champion isn\u0027t your Uncle Ennis, is he?\"\n \"No,\" he answered. \"Uncle Ennis wouldn\u0027t do. He\u0027s too nice.\"\n She laughed. \"And it wouldn\u0027t do to have a nice protector?\" She could tell he thought she\u0027d asked a stupid question.\n \"No, you got to be mean to your enemies, not nice. That\u0027s why Papa asked Uncle Brodick. He\u0027s my new champion, and he\u0027s not ever nice. You know what?\"\n Those three words were beginning to drive her to distraction. \"No, what?\" she asked.\n \"Brodick\u0027s probably spitting fire now \u0027cause he told Papa not to let me go to the festival, but Mama had her way, and Papa gave in.\"\n \"Did your Uncle Brodick attend the festival?\"\n \"No, he\u0027d never go to one \u0027cause there\u0027s too many Englishmen there. I\u0027ll bet he doesn\u0027t think I\u0027m dead. He\u0027s the new laird over all the Buchanans, and everyone knows how stubborn the Buchanans are. Now that he\u0027s my protector, I get to call him Uncle. Maybe he\u0027s gonna come here and find me before my papa does.\"\n \"Maybe he will,\" she agreed to placate him. \"Why don\u0027t you put your head down in my lap and close your eyes. Rest for a little while.\"\n \"You won\u0027t leave while I\u0027m sleeping, will you?\"\n \"Where would I go?\"\n He smiled when he realized how foolish his worry was. \"I\u0027m gonna be scared when you have to go away. I heard the baron tell his friends you got to go get your sister. He\u0027s gonna be mad when he finds out you lost her.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me this before?\"\n \"I forgot.\"\n \"What else did he say?\" she implored. \"I need to know everything.\"\n \"I remember he said your king\u0027s looking for the box too, but the baron\u0027s got to find it first. I don\u0027t know why. I don\u0027t remember anything else,\" he ended on a wail. \"I want my papa to come and get me now.\"\n \"Please don\u0027t cry,\" she pleaded. She hugged him close. \"A boy who has three protectors should be smiling, not crying.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have three. I only got one.\"\n \"Yes, you do too have three. Your father\u0027s one, Brodick is two, and I\u0027m your third protector. I\u0027ll be your champion until the day I get you safely home.\"\n \"But ladies can\u0027t be champions.\"\n \"Of course they can.\"\n He puzzled over the possibility a long minute and then nodded. \"All right,\" he agreed. \"But you got to give me something then.\"\n \"I do?\"\n He nodded again. \"A protector always gives something important to the boy or girl he\u0027s supposed to watch out for,\" he explained. \"You got to give me something of yours.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-7.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: \n As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
