He could see speckles of bright red blood dotting the rocks he\u0027d already squirmed over, and that scared him almost as much as his precarious position. If his papa could see him now, he\u0027d surely ask him if he\u0027d gone and lost his senses, and he might even shake his head in disappointment, but he\u0027d also be hauling him up and making everything all right and safe too, and… oh, Papa, I wish you were here now. Tears came into his eyes then, and he knew he was going to forget his own promise and cry like a baby. He wanted to go home and sit on his mama\u0027s lap and let her muss his hair and hold him close and make a fuss over him. She\u0027d help him find his senses too—whatever those were—and then Papa wouldn\u0027t get upset. Thinking about his parents made him so homesick he began to whimper. His fingers dug into the rope until they, too, were raw and bleeding, making his grip less sure. His arm ached, his fingers throbbed, and his belly burned, but he tried to ignore the pain, for panic had taken hold and all he could think about was getting away before the devil discovered he was missing. Lowering himself into the gorge was much more difficult than he\u0027d supposed it would be, but he continued on, not daring to look into the yawning mouth of the abyss that was surely as deep as purgatory. He tried to pretend he was climbing down from one of the big old trees back home, because he was a good, nimble tree climber, even better than his older brother. His papa had told him so. Exhausted, he stopped to rest. He looked up and was surprised at how far he\u0027d come, and for an instant he felt pride over his achievement. But then his lifeline began to unravel. His pride turned to terror and he burst into tears. He was certain that he would never see his mama and papa again. By the time Lady Gillian caught up with the boy, her chest felt as though it were on fire, and she could barely catch her breath. She had followed his trail through the thick forest, running as fast as her legs would carry her, and when at last she reached the cliffs and heard the child crying, she collapsed to her knees in acute relief. The little boy was still alive, thank God. Her joy was short-lived however, for when she reached for his rope to pull him up to safety, she saw how threadbare it was and knew it was only a matter of minutes before the unraveling threads completely disintegrated. She was afraid even to touch the rope. If she dared pull on it, the threads would rub against the rocks and shred more quickly. Shouting the order for him to stay completely still, she stretched out on her stomach and forced herself to look over the edge. Heights terrified her and she felt a wave of nausea as she looked down into the chasm below. How in God\u0027s name was she going to get him? It would take too long to retrace her steps to fetch a good sturdy rope, and her chances of being spotted by one of Alford\u0027s soldiers were too great to risk. There were jagged stones jutting out from the rock, and she knew that a more experienced man or woman might be able to climb down. But she wasn\u0027t experienced—or nimble. Looking down made her dizzy, but, dear God, she couldn\u0027t leave him, and time was critical. The rope would soon snap, and the child would plunge to his death. There wasn\u0027t any choice, and so she said a frantic prayer to God to give her courage. Don\u0027t look down, she silently chanted as she turned and cautiously scooted over the edge on her stomach. Don\u0027t look down. Gillian cried out with joy each time her foot touched one of the protruding stones. Just like stairs, she pretended. When at last she was level with the boy, she leaned her forehead against the cold rock, closed her eyes, and thanked God for letting her get this far without breaking her neck. She slowly turned toward the child. He couldn\u0027t be more than five or six years old, and he was desperately trying to be brave and bold at the same time. He had been clinging to the rope for several minutes now, holding tight with one hand and clutching a dagger—her dagger—in his other hand. His eyes were wide with terror, but she could see the tears there as well, and, oh, how her heart ached for him. She was his only hope for survival, but he was stubbornly afraid to trust her. Defiant, foolishly so, he would neither speak to her nor look at her, and each time she tried to grab hold of him, he thrust the dagger, slicing her arm with each jab. She wouldn\u0027t give up though, even if it meant she died trying. \"Stop this nonsense and let me help you,\" she demanded. \"I swear to heaven, you don\u0027t have any sense at all. Can\u0027t you see your rope is tearing?\" The sharpness in her tone jarred the boy, and he was able to shake himself out of his terror. He stared at the blood dripping down her fingertips, suddenly realized what he had done to her, and threw the dagger away. \"I\u0027m sorry, lady,\" he cried out in Gaelic. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m not supposed to hurt ladies, not ever.\" He\u0027d spoken so quickly and his words were so garbled with his brogue, she barely caught what he said. \"Will you let me help you?\" She hoped he understood her but wasn\u0027t sure if she\u0027d used the correct words, for she only had a rudimentary knowledge of Gaelic. Before he could answer, she cried out, \"Don\u0027t wiggle like that, the rope will snap. Let me reach for you.\" \"Hurry, lady,\" he whispered, though this time he spoke her language. Gillian edged close, held on to the indentation in the rock above her head with one hand to balance herself, and then reached out for him. She had just wrapped her bloody arm around his waist and was pulling him onto the ledge with her when the rope snapped. If the child hadn\u0027t already had one foot securely on the rock ledge, they both would have fallen backward. She squeezed him against her and let out a loud sigh of relief. \"You were just in time,\" he told her as he uncoiled the rope from his wrist and tossed it down into the chasm. He wanted to watch it land, but when he tried to turn around, she tightened her hold and ordered him to stay perfectly still. \"We\u0027ve made it this far,\" she said so weakly she doubted he heard her. \"Now for the difficult part.\" He heard the shiver in her voice. \"Are you scared, lady?\" he asked. \"Oh, yes, I\u0027m scared. I\u0027m going to let go of you now. Lean against the rock and don\u0027t move. I\u0027m going to start climbing back up and…\" \"But we got to go down, not up.\" \"Please don\u0027t shout,\" she said. \"We can\u0027t possibly climb all the way down. There aren\u0027t enough footholds. Can\u0027t you see the rock is sheared smooth?\" \"Maybe if you went and got a good rope, we could—\" She cut him off. \"It\u0027s out of the question.\" Both of her hands gripped the edge of the tiny crevice above her head and she searched for a way to lift herself. The strength seemed to have gone out of her and, though she gave it a valiant try, she couldn\u0027t climb back up. \"You know what, lady?\" \"Hush,\" she whispered as she said a silent prayer for strength and made another attempt. \"But you know what?\" \"No, what?\" she asked as she rested against the rock and tried to calm her racing heartbeat. \"There\u0027s a real big ledge down under us. I saw it. We could jump down. Look down, lady, and you can see for yourself. It isn\u0027t far.\" \"I don\u0027t want to look down.\" \"But you got to look so you can see where it is. Then maybe we can crawl along—\" \"No!\" she shouted as she again tried to raise herself to the next foothold. If she could only accomplish that little feat, she could surely figure out a way to reach down and pull the little boy up too. The child watched her struggle. \"Are you too puny to climb back up?\" \"I suppose I am.\" \"Can I help?\" \"No, just stand perfectly still.\" Once again she tried to climb, but it was a futile effort at best. She was in such a panic inside, she could barely draw a decent breath. Dear Lord, she didn\u0027t think she had ever been this afraid in all her life. \"You know what, lady?\" The little boy was relentless, and she gave up trying to quiet him. \"No, what?\" \"We got to go down, not up.\" \"We\u0027re going up.\" \"Then how come we aren\u0027t moving?\" \"Try to be patient,\" she ordered. \"I can\u0027t seem to get a proper hold. Give me a minute and I\u0027ll try again.\" \"You can\u0027t climb up \u0027cause I hurt you. You got blood all over your clothes. I cut you bad. I\u0027m awful sorry, lady, but I got scared.\" He sounded on the verge of tears. She quickly tried to calm him. \"Don\u0027t fret about it,\" she said as she made one more attempt. With a groan of frustration, she finally gave up. \"I think you\u0027re right. We\u0027re going to have to go down.\" Ever so slowly she turned around on the narrow ledge, and with her back pressed against the rock, she sat down. The child watched her, then spun around and plopped down beside her. The quickness in his action nearly gave her heart palpitations, and she grabbed hold of his arm. \"Can we jump now?\" he asked eagerly. The boy really didn\u0027t have a lick of sense. \"No, we aren\u0027t going to jump. We\u0027re going to ease our way down. Take hold of my hand and hold tight.\" \"But you got blood on your hand.\" She quickly wiped the blood on her skirt, then took hold of his hand. Together they peered over the side. Gillian had to look to make certain the ledge was wide enough. She had to say a prayer too, and after she was finished, she held her breath and scooted off the ledge. The distance wasn\u0027t all that far, but still, the impact jarred her. The little boy lost his balance as they landed, and she jerked him back just in time. He threw himself into her arms, pitching her hard against the rock wall, then buried his face in her shoulder and trembled violently. \"I almost kept going.\" \"Yes, you did,\" she agreed. \"But we\u0027re safe now.\" \"Aren\u0027t we going to go down more?\" \"No. We\u0027re going to stay here.\" They huddled together for several minutes on the rock plate that protruded from the canyon wall before the boy was able to let go of her. He recovered from his near brush with death quickly, though, and after another minute or two, he crawled away from her side to reach the wider section of rock that had been hidden by a thick overhang. Looking as pleased as could be, he folded his legs underneath him and motioned for her to come forward. She shook her head. \"I\u0027m fine where I am.\" \"It\u0027s gonna rain and you\u0027ll get all wet. It isn\u0027t hard. Just don\u0027t look down.\" As if to underscore his prediction, a clap of thunder rumbled in the distance. Ever so slowly she scooted toward him. Her heart was pounding like a drum, and she was so scared she thought she might throw up. The child, it seemed, had more courage than she did. \"How come you don\u0027t like looking down?\" he asked as he crawled forward to peer into the chasm. He was dangerously close to the edge, and she frantically grabbed hold of his ankles and pulled him back. \"Don\u0027t do that.\" \"But I want to spit down and see where it lands.\" \"Sit beside me and be quiet for a moment. I have to think what to do.\" \"But how come you don\u0027t like looking down?\" \"I just don\u0027t.\" \"Maybe it makes you sick. Your face got real green. Were you gonna puke?\" \"No,\" she answered wearily. \"Does it scare you to look down?\" He was relentless. \"Why do you ask so many questions?\" He lifted his shoulders in an exaggerated shrug. \"I don\u0027t know; I just do.\" \"And I don\u0027t know why it scares me to look down; it just does. I don\u0027t even like looking out of my bedroom window because it\u0027s up so high. It makes me dizzy.\" \"Are all English ladies like you?\" \"No, I don\u0027t suppose they are.\" \"Most are puny,\" he announced authoritatively. \"My Uncle Ennis told me so.\" \"Your uncle\u0027s wrong. Most ladies are not puny. They can do anything a man can do.\" The child must have thought her remark was hilarious because he laughed so forcefully his shoulders shook. She found herself wondering how in heaven\u0027s name a boy so young could be so arrogant. He turned her attention with yet another question. \"What\u0027s your name, lady?\" \"Gillian.\" He waited for her to ask him his name, and when she didn\u0027t, he nudged her. \"Don\u0027t you want to know my name?\" \"I already know your name. I heard the soldiers talking about you. You\u0027re Michael and you belong to a clan led by a man named Laird Ramsey. You\u0027re his brother.\" The boy was vehemently shaking his head. \"No, Michael isn\u0027t my real name,\" he said. He cuddled up next to her and took hold of her hand. \"We were playing a trick when the men came and grabbed me. They put me in a wheat sack.\" \"That must have been very frightening for you,\" she said. \"What kind of a trick were you playing?\" Before he could answer her, she asked, \"Why didn\u0027t you wait for me in the stables? It could have been so easy to get away if you had only done what I told you to do. And why did you stab my arm? You knew I was your friend. I unlocked the door for you, didn\u0027t I? If only you had trusted me…\" \"I\u0027m not supposed to trust the English. Everyone knows that.\" \"Did your Uncle Ennis tell you that?\" \"No, my Uncle Brodick did,\" he explained. \"But I already knew.\" \"Do you trust me?\" \"Maybe I do,\" he answered. \"I didn\u0027t mean to cut you. Does it hurt fierce?\" It hurt like hell, but she wasn\u0027t going to admit it because of the anxiety she saw in his eyes. The little boy had enough worries on his mind, and she wasn\u0027t going to add to them. \"It\u0027ll be fine,\" she insisted. \"I suppose I should do something about the bleeding though.\" While he watched, she tore a strip from her underskirt and wrapped it around and around her arm. The boy tied the knot for her at her wrist. Then she tugged her torn, bloody sleeve back down over the bandage. \"There, I\u0027m as fit as new.\" \"You know what?\" She let out a sigh. \"No, what?\" \"I hurt my fingers.\" He sounded as if he were boasting of an incredible feat and smiled when he held his hand up for her to see. \"Now I can\u0027t do nothing to help us, \u0027cause my fingers burn.\" \"I imagine they do.\" His face lit up. He was a beautiful little boy, with dark curls and the most beguiling gray eyes she\u0027d ever seen. His nose and cheeks were covered with freckles.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-6.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
