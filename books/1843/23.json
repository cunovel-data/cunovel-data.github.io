Without asking permission, he climbed onto her lap, pulled her arms around him, and grinned at her.\n \"You and Alec have become close friends,\" Judith remarked, smiling.\n \"Iain, perhaps you could wait until Alec has gone to bed to hear the details,\" Brodick suggested.\n \"But I get to stay up late \u0027cause Papa said we have to celebrate,\" Alec blurted. \"Didn\u0027t you say so, Papa?\"\n \"Yes,\" his father agreed.\n \"You know what, Gillian?\" Alec whispered loudly.\n She leaned down. \"No, what?\"\n \"When I go to bed, Mama\u0027s gonna sit with me until I fall asleep, and my brother sleeps in the same room with me, so maybe I won\u0027t have bad dreams and I won\u0027t get scared.\"\n \"Perhaps you won\u0027t dream at all tonight.\"\n \"But you got to have someone to sleep with too, so you won\u0027t get scared \u0027cause I won\u0027t be there.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be just fine,\" she assured him.\n Alec wasn\u0027t convinced. \"But what if you do get scared? You got to have someone to wake you up. Maybe you could ask Brodick to sleep with you again like he did before.\"\n She clapped her hand over his mouth to get him to hush and felt her face burn with mortification. She knew Brodick was watching her, but she didn\u0027t dare look at him.\n Judith laughed. \"Alec, sweetheart, you\u0027re embarrassing Gillian.\"\n \"Mama, you know what Gillian calls me?\"\n \"No, what?\"\n Giggling, the little boy said, \"Honey bear.\"\n Iain\u0027s gaze went back and forth between Gillian and Brodick. \"Father Laggan\u0027s back,\" he remarked. \"And there\u0027s another, younger priest named Stevens with him.\"\n \"Why are you telling me this?\" Brodick asked.\n \"I just wanted you to know there are two priests available,\" Iain explained with a meaningful glance at Gillian.\n \"I didn\u0027t sleep with Brodick,\" she blurted out. \"I have no need for a priest.\"\n \"Yes, you did too.\"\n \"Alec, it isn\u0027t polite to contradict your elders.\"\n \"But, Mama…\"\n \"Hush, sweetheart.\"\n Gillian glared at Brodick. He could easily correct this horrid misunderstanding if he would only offer a quick explanation.\n He wasn\u0027t inclined. He winked at her. \"I didn\u0027t know a face could get that red,\" he remarked.\n \"Do explain,\" she demanded.\n \"Explain what?\" he asked, feigning innocence.\n She turned to Judith. \"We were camping… and it isn\u0027t what it sounds like… I did sleep, and when I awakened… they were all there…\"\n \"They? \"Iain asked.\n \"His soldiers.\"\n \"You slept with his soldiers too?\"\n She didn\u0027t understand that Iain was teasing her. \"No… that is to say, we… slept. That\u0027s all that happened, Laird.\"\n \"Stop tormenting her,\" Judith ordered. \"Can you not see how distressing this is for her? Gillian doesn\u0027t understand the Highlanders\u0027 humor. What happened to your arm?\" Judith asked then, thinking to turn the subject to a less delicate one. \"I noticed the bandage, and I was curious—\"\n Alec interrupted his mother. Jumping off Gillian\u0027s lap, he cried out, \"Papa, we got to take a walk.\"\n \"Now?\"\n \"Yes, Papa, now.\"\n \"Alec, I want to talk to Brodick and Gillian. I\u0027m anxious to hear how they found you.\"\n \"But, Papa, I got to tell you what I did, and then you\u0027re gonna be mad at me. We got to take a walk so I can think about it.\"\n \"Come here, son,\" his father ordered, concerned by the anxiety he saw in Alec\u0027s eyes.\n The little boy dragged his feet and kept his head down as he went to his father. Iain laid his hands on his shoulders and leaned forward.\n Alec promptly burst into tears. \"I got real scared, Papa, and I cut Gillian\u0027s arm, and then it got all swollen, and Annie had to fix it, and it\u0027s all my fault \u0027cause I hurt a lady, and I\u0027m not ever supposed to hurt ladies, but I got real scared. I didn\u0027t like England and I wanted to come home.\" Alec threw his arms around his father\u0027s neck and began to sob in earnest.\n \"Alec has been very worried that he would disappoint you, Laird,\" Gillian explained. \"He didn\u0027t understand that I was trying to help him. He had climbed down with a rope into a gorge, but it was an old rope, and it began to unravel, and he…\" She looked to Brodick for help. The task of explaining suddenly became overwhelming and she was so weary she didn\u0027t know where to start.\n \"My son isn\u0027t making much sense,\" Iain said. \"He says he was in England?\"\n Gillian braced herself for the ordeal ahead and quietly said, \"He speaks the truth. Alec was in England.\"\n \"I told you so, Papa.\"\n Iain nodded but kept his attention on Gillian. \"How did my son get to England?\"\n \"Alec didn\u0027t go into the falls. He was taken from the festival and imprisoned in a castle in England. That is where I met him.\"\n The expression on Iain\u0027s face changed. He put Alec in Judith\u0027s lap, and stood. For his son\u0027s sake, he tried to keep his voice mild when in fact he wanted to shout.\n \"Who took him?\"\n Gillian felt an instant of real fear as the laird towered over her, glowering as though he had already decided she was fully responsible for his son\u0027s jeopardy.\n \"It was a mistake,\" she began.\n \"Damned right it was,\" Iain roared.\n Alec\u0027s eyes grew wide. \"Are you angry, Papa?\"\n His father took a deep breath. \"Yes,\" he snapped.\n \"He isn\u0027t angry with you, Alec,\" Gillian whispered.\n \"He knows that.\"\n \"Don\u0027t snap at Gillian.\" Brodick, who had remained silent up until now, sounded as angry as Iain when he gave the command. \"She is as innocent as your son in this. Sit down, and I\u0027ll tell you what I have learned. I know you\u0027re anxious to hear it all, but you cannot raise your voice to Gillian. I will not allow it.\"\n Gillian could see that Iain was ready to explode and hurried to explain before the two lairds got into a real fight. \"When I said it was a mistake…\"\n \"Yes?\" Iain asked.\n \"The men who took Alec thought they were stealing Ramsey\u0027s brother, Michael. They kidnapped the wrong boy.\"\n \"For the love of…\" Iain was so enraged he couldn\u0027t go on.\n \"Sit down, husband,\" Judith suggested. \"Listen to what Gillian has to say.\"\n He nearly overturned the chair when he ripped it out from the table and sat down. Leaning back, he stared hard at Gillian for several seconds.\n \"Start talking.\"\n \"It\u0027s a very long story, Laird, and Ramsey should be here any minute now, shouldn\u0027t he? If you could please wait…\"\n Iain\u0027s jaw was clenched and he shook his head.\n \"Papa, you know what?\" The little boy smiled up at his father when he spoke, and Iain reached over to pat him.\n \"No, what, Alec?\" he asked gruffly.\n \"We sneaked away twice, but the first time we got dragged back, and it was all my fault \u0027cause I didn\u0027t wait like I was supposed to.\"\n Iain blinked as he tried to sort out his son\u0027scontusing explanation. \"What happened the first time you got away?\"\n \"I climbed down into the gorge is what I did,\" he boasted. \"But I didn\u0027t get a good rope.\"\n \"It was threadbare,\" Gillian interjected.\n \"My son climbed down into a gorge with a threadbare rope?\" Iain lashed out. \"And where were you while Alec was attempting this?\"\n \"Papa, she told me to wait for her, but I didn\u0027t, and we weren\u0027t supposed to go into the canyon, but I thought it would be faster. Then I got good and stuck, didn\u0027t I, Gillian?\"\n \"Yes, you did.\"\n \"I was supposed to wait in the stable.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t,\" his mother said.\n \"No, and I thought Gillian was gonna puke \u0027cause her face turned green when she looked over the side and saw me. She told me she gets awful sick when she\u0027s got to look way down, and she sometimes gets dizzy too.\"\n \"You\u0027re afraid of—\" Judith began.\n Her husband interrupted with a question of his own. \"But you climbed down to get Alec anyway?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t have any other choice.\"\n \"She had to fetch me, Papa,\" Alec explained. \"And she was just in time \u0027cause the rope broke right in half just after she grabbed me. She told me she was awful scared, but she didn\u0027t puke.\"\n The child sounded a little disappointed over that fact. Neither one of his parents smiled, for they were both thinking about the near miss their son had had.\n They were also realizing that Gillian had saved him.\n \"I will force myself to be patient a little longer and wait until Ramsey arrives to hear your accounting,\" Iain announced. \"But at the very least, give me the names of the bastards who stole my child from me,\" he demanded. \"By God, I want to know who they are and now, this minute.\"\n \"I\u0027ve warned you not to take that tone with Gillian. Now I\u0027m ordering you, Iain. I won\u0027t have her upset.\"\n Judith Maitland couldn\u0027t make up her mind who was more surprised by Brodick\u0027s angry outburst. Iain looked flabbergasted, and Gillian appeared to be incredulous.\n Iain quickly recovered. He leaned forward and in a furious hiss said, \"You dare to order me?\"\n Brodick also leaned forward. \"That\u0027s exactly what I—\"\n Gillian, hoping to avert the budding hostility, blurted out, \"Shouting at me won\u0027t upset me.\"\n \"But it upsets me, Gillian.\"\n Gillian wondered if Brodick realized he was nearly shouting at her now. She looked to Judith for help, but it was Alec who inadvertently turned his father\u0027s attention.\n \"Papa, don\u0027t yell at Gillian,\" Alec cried out as he ran around the table to Gillian and climbed into her lap. \"She never shouted at me, not even when the man beat her. She tricked him good, Papa.\"\n \"Someone beat her?\" Iain asked.\n Alec nodded. \"She made him beat her so he wouldn\u0027t beat me.\"\n The little boy suddenly remembered the ring Gillian had given him and pulled the ribbon over his head. \"Gillian said she was gonna be my champion, just like Uncle Brodick, and she told me I could keep the ring until I got back home. She promised me she wasn\u0027t gonna let nobody hurt me and she didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t need the ring anymore to remind me I\u0027m safe, but I still want to keep it.\"\n \"You can\u0027t, Alec,\" Gillian said softly.\n He reluctantly handed the ring to her. \"Uncle Brodick said I could keep his dagger forever.\"\n She laughed. \"I\u0027m still not going to let you keep my grandmother\u0027s ring.\"\n Judith placed her hand on top of her husband\u0027s. \"You do realize that if it were not for this dear lady, our son would be dead.\"\n \"Of course, I realize—\"\n \"Then I suggest, instead of shouting at her and treating her as though you hold her responsible for the actions of others, you thank her. I plan to get down on my knees and thank God for sending her to Alec. She was his guardian angel.\"\n The emotional speech humbled Gillian, and she shook her head in protest. Judith dabbed at her eyes with a linen cloth and then stood.\n \"Gillian,\" Iain began, his voice hesitant. \"I do thank you for protecting my son, and I certainly didn\u0027t mean to imply that I in any way hold you responsible. If I gave you that impression, I apologize. As difficult as it will be, I\u0027ll wait for Ramsey to join us to find out what happened.\"\n Judith beamed with satisfaction. \"I do believe that is the very first time I\u0027ve ever heard you apologize. It\u0027s a momentous occasion. And since you are now in such an accommodating mood, may I suggest that you and Ramsey wait until after the celebration to hear what Gillian has to say. Tonight is Alec\u0027s homecoming and our friends and relatives will be here soon.\" Judith didn\u0027t wait for her husband\u0027s agreement. \"Gillian will want to freshen up now.\"\n \"Gillian likes to take baths, Mama,\" Alec said. \"She made me wash too. I didn\u0027t want to, but she made me.\"\n Judith laughed. \"She took good care of you, Alec,\" she said as she clasped hold of Gillian\u0027s arm. \"How would you like a hot bath now?\"\n \"I would like that very much.\"\n \"I\u0027ll find clean clothes for you and have these washed right away,\" she promised. \"The Maitland plaid will keep you nice and warm,\" she added. \"Though the days are warm, it gets quite chilly at night.\"\n Hearing that Gillian would wear the Maitland plaid didn\u0027t sit well with Brodick. Without thinking how his words would be interpreted, he said, \"She\u0027ll wear the Buchanan plaid for this celebration.\"\n Iain folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. \"Why do you want her to wear your colors? Are you claiming—\"\n Brodick cut him off. \"My soldiers would be… upset. They would surely rebel if they saw her in your plaid, Iain. They\u0027ve taken a liking to the lass and have become very possessive and protective of her. While she\u0027s in the Highlands, she\u0027ll wear our colors. I won\u0027t have the Buchanan soldiers insulted.\"\n Iain grinned. \"You\u0027re worried that your men will be upset? Is that what I heard you say? For God\u0027s sake, they\u0027re warriors, not…\"\n He was going to say \"women,\" but quickly changed his mind when his wife gave him a sharp look. With a smile he substituted \"children.\"\n Judith laughed, for she knew her husband was trying to be diplomatic for her sake. She started toward the stairs then, but Gillian paused to turn back to Brodick.\n \"Brodick, you did promise your brother, Winslow, you would see his wife and children.\"\n \"I remember what I promised.\"\n \"Then you\u0027ll be here when I return?\"\n Exasperated that she still couldn\u0027t get up the courage to ask him a direct question, he said, \"Yes.\"\n She nodded before hurrying after Judith. She tried to hide her relief that Brodick would stay a bit longer, and then she became angry with herself for feeling the way she did. She was acting like a fool because she was letting herself become dependent on him, and she had no right to lean on the man. No, she couldn\u0027t ask anything more of him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-23.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: \n As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
