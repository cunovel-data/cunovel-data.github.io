It has his crest on the hilt. Papa made a leather sheath for it, and he let me take it to the festival. Now it\u0027s gone.\"\n \"What happened to it?\"\n \"One of the baron\u0027s soldiers grabbed it from me. I saw him throw it on the chest in the great hall.\"\n \"We\u0027ll find a way to get it back,\" she promised.\n \"But what are you gonna give me?\" he asked again.\n She held up her hand. \"Do you see this ring I\u0027m wearing? I treasure it above all things.\"\n In the dying light it was difficult to see the ring clearly. He pulled her hand toward him and squinted down at it. \"It\u0027s pretty.\"\n \"It belonged to my grandmother. My uncle Morgan gave it to me on my last birthday. I\u0027ll loop it through my ribbon and tie it around your neck. You\u0027ll wear it under your tunic so the baron won\u0027t see it.\"\n \"Can I keep it forever?\"\n \"No, you can\u0027t,\" she said. \"After I\u0027ve kept my promise to you and gotten you safely home, you\u0027ll give the ring back to me. Now close your eyes and try to sleep. Why don\u0027t you think about how happy your parents are going to be when they see you again.\"\n \"Mama will cry \u0027cause she\u0027ll be so happy, and Papa will be happy too, but he won\u0027t cry \u0027cause warriors never cry. He won\u0027t be happy very long, though, \u0027cause I\u0027m gonna have to tell him I disobeyed him.\"\n \"How did you disobey him?\"\n \"He told me not to go near the waterfall. He said it was too dangerous for a boy to play there \u0027cause the rocks were slippery, but I went anyway with my friend, and when I tell Papa, he\u0027s gonna be mad at me.\"\n \"Are you afraid of your father?\"\n He snickered. \"I could never be afraid of my papa.\"\n \"Then why are you so worried?\"\n \"\u0027Cause he\u0027ll make me take a walk with him, that\u0027s why, and then he\u0027ll make me think about what I did and tell him why it was wrong, and then he\u0027ll punish me.\"\n \"What will he do?\"\n \"He maybe won\u0027t let me go riding with him for a spell… that would be the worst punishment \u0027cause I really like to ride on his lap. Papa lets me hold the reins.\"\n She rubbed his back and suggested he not worry about it now. He wasn\u0027t through confessing his sins. \"But that\u0027s not all I got to tell him,\" he said. \"I got to tell him what me and Michael did.\"\n \"Your friend\u0027s name is also Michael?\"\n \"My friend is Michael,\" he said. \"I told you, we were playing a trick.\"\n \"Don\u0027t fret about it now. Your father isn\u0027t going to care about a game you and your friend were playing.\"\n \"But…\"\n \"Sleep, \" she ordered.\n He quieted down and was silent for several minutes. She thought he\u0027d finally fallen asleep, and she turned her thoughts to more urgent matters.\n \"You know what?\"\n She sighed. \"No, what?\"\n \"I like you, but I don\u0027t like most of the English. Uncle Ennis hates them all. He told me so. He says if you shake an Englishman\u0027s hand, you\u0027ll come away without your fingers, but that isn\u0027t true, is it?\"\n \"No, that isn\u0027t true.\"\n \"Are you sorry you have to be English?\"\n \"No, I\u0027m just sorry Alford is.\"\n \"He\u0027s ignorant. You know why?\"\n She had the feeling he wouldn\u0027t let up until he had told her what was on his mind. \"No, why?\" she dutifully asked.\n \"\u0027Cause he thinks I\u0027m Michael.\"\n She stopped rubbing his back and went completely still. \"You aren\u0027t Michael?\"\n He rolled onto his back and then sat up to face her. \"No, my friend\u0027s Michael. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to tell you. The stupid baron thinks I\u0027m Laird Ramsey\u0027s brother, but I\u0027m not. Michael is. That\u0027s the trick we were playing. We changed plaids, and we were gonna see how long it took for anyone to notice. When it got dark, I was gonna go to Michael\u0027s tent and he was gonna go to mine.\"\n \"Oh, dear God,\" she whispered, so stunned she could barely catch her breath. The innocent little boy didn\u0027t have any idea of the significance of what he had just told her, and all he was worried about was his father\u0027s reaction when he round out about a silly game his son was playing with his friend. It was only a matter of time before Alford would discover the truth, and when he did, this child\u0027s fate would be doomed.\n She grabbed hold of his shoulders and pulled him close. \"Listen to me,\" she whispered urgently. \"You must never tell anyone what you\u0027ve just told me. Promise me.\"\n \"I promise.\"\n There were only a few flashes of distant lightning to illuminate the gray stones of the canyon, and it was difficult for her to see his face clearly. She pulled him close, searching his eyes, and whispered, \"Who are you?\"\n \"Alec.\"\n Her hands dropped into her lap and she leaned back against the wall. \"You\u0027re Alec,\" she repeated. She couldn\u0027t get over her surprise, but the boy didn\u0027t seem to notice her stunned reaction.\n He grinned at her and said, \"Do you see? The baron is too ignorant \u0027cause he captured the wrong boy.\"\n \"Yes, I see. Alec, did your friend see Alford\u0027s men take you away from the festival?\"\n He held his lower lip between his teeth while he thought about what had happened. \"No,\" he answered. \"Michael went back to his tent to get his bow and arrows \u0027cause we wanted to shoot them over the falls, and that\u0027s when the men came and grabbed me. You know what? I don\u0027t think the men were the baron\u0027s soldiers \u0027cause they were wearing plaids.\"\n \"How many were there?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know… maybe three.\"\n \"If they\u0027re Highlanders, they\u0027re traitors then in league with the baron,\" she muttered as she threaded her fingers through her hair in agitation. \"What a mess this is.\"\n \"But what if the baron finds out I\u0027m not Michael? He\u0027s gonna be mad, isn\u0027t he? Maybe he\u0027ll make the traitors go and get my friend then. I hope they don\u0027t put Michael in a wheat sack. It\u0027s scary.\"\n \"We\u0027re going to have to find a way to warn Michael\u0027s family of the danger.\"\n Her mind was racing from one thought to another as she tried to understand the twisted game Alford was playing.\n \"Alec, if you both changed clothes and Michael was wearing your plaid, wouldn\u0027t his clan notice? Surely he\u0027d tell one of them about the trick you were playing.\"\n \"Maybe he\u0027d be too scared to tell.\"\n \"How old is Michael?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he answered. \"Maybe he\u0027s almost my age. You know what? Maybe he took my plaid off is what he did. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do if I got real scared, and he\u0027d be afraid to make his brother mad \u0027cause he doesn\u0027t know his brother very good at all since he only just came back home to be laird. Michael was kind of scared to play the trick too \u0027cause he didn\u0027t want to get in trouble. It\u0027s my fault,\" he cried out, \" \u0027cause I made him do it.\"\n \"I want you to stop worrying that you did anything wrong. No one\u0027s going to blame you. You were just playing a harmless game, that\u0027s all. Why don\u0027t you put your head down in my lap and be real quiet for a few minutes so I can think.\"\n She closed her eyes then to discourage him from asking any more questions.\n He wasn\u0027t going to cooperate. \"You know what?\" When she didn\u0027t answer him, he began to tug on her sleeve. \"You know what?\"\n She gave up. \"What?\"\n \"My tooth is loose.\" To prove he was telling the truth, he grabbed her hand and made her touch one of his front teeth with the tip of her finger. \"See how it wiggles back and forth when you touch it? Maybe it\u0027ll come out tomorrow.\"\n The eagerness in his voice as he told her his important news was a jolting reminder of how very young he was. Losing his tooth obviously thrilled him.\n \"Papa was gonna pull it out for me, but then he said I had to wait until it got good and loose.\"\n With a loud yawn, he put his head in her lap and patiently waited for her to rub his back again.\n \"I was gonna ask Papa to pull my tooth out at the festival \u0027cause Michael wanted to watch. Michael belongs to Ramsey,\" he added just in case she\u0027d forgotten.\n \"And who do you belong to, Alec?\"\n He puffed up with importance. \"I\u0027m Iain Maitland\u0027s son.\"\n Chapter Three\n Alford liked to play games. He was especially partial to any game that involved cruelty.\n He was having a fine time now, though in fact his day hadn\u0027t started out well at all. He\u0027d returned to Dunhanshire at midday on Sunday soaked through and chilled to the bone because of an unexpected and torrential downpour that had caught him unaware en route, and feeling quite miserable, he certainly wasn\u0027t in the mood to hear that Lady Gillian had tried to help the boy escape. Before he could work himself up into a good rage—he\u0027d already killed the soldier who had imparted the unpleasant news—Gillian and the boy were located and brought back to the castle, and they now stood before him, waiting to hear their punishment.\n Anticipation heightened Alford\u0027s pleasure. He wanted them to wallow in their own fears, and making them guess what torture he had in mind for them was all part of Alford\u0027s game. The boy, the simpleton brother of Laird Ramsey, was too stupid to understand or speak, but Alford could tell he was frightened because of the way he kept trying to edge closer to Gillian. She, on the other hand, was proving to be quite a disappointment, and if he hadn\u0027t known better, he would have thought she was deliberately trying to ruin his fun. She didn\u0027t appear to be the least bit concerned about her fate. He couldn\u0027t discern any fear at all in her.\n The bitch still had the power to spook him, and he silently cursed himself for his own cowardice because he couldn\u0027t hold her gaze long. Save me from the righteous, he thought to himself. Going into battle against a league of soldiers was far less intimidating than this mere slip of a girl, and although he reminded himself that he was the one with the power and that he could order her death by simply uttering a quick command, in his mind she still had the upper hand. He\u0027d never forgotten how she had looked at him when he\u0027d ordered her brought before him after the massacre. She had been a little girl then, but the memory still made him inwardly flinch. He knew she had seen him kill her father, but he\u0027d believed that in time the memory would fade from her mind. Now he wasn\u0027t so certain. What else did she remember? Had she heard him confessing his sins to her father before he gutted him? The question brought chills to Alford\u0027s spine. Gillian\u0027s hatred frightened him, weakened him, made his skin crawl.\n His hand shook as he reached for his goblet of wine, and he diligently tried to shrug off his fears and get down to the business at hand. He knew that his mind wasn\u0027t sharp now, but dull and muddled. It was unusual for him to become this inebriated in front of his friends. He\u0027d been a heavy drinker for years because the memories wouldn\u0027t let him rest. But he\u0027d always been careful to drink when he was alone. Today he\u0027d made an exception to his own rule because the wine helped ease his anger. He didn\u0027t want to do anything he might later regret, and though he had considered waiting until tomorrow to deal with Gillian\u0027s defiance, he decided that he was still clearheaded enough to get the chore over and done with so he and his companions could continue their celebration.\n Alford stared at Gillian through bleary, bloodshot eyes. He sat at the center of the long table and was flanked by his constant companions, Baron Hugh of Barlowe and Baron Edwin the Bald. He rarely went anywhere without his friends, as they were his most appreciative audience. They so enjoyed his games that they often begged to join in, and Alford never had to worry that either one of them would ever betray him, for they were just as culpable in their past transgressions as he was.\n Gillian and the boy hadn\u0027t eaten since early morning the day before, and Alford assumed both would be ravenous by now, so he forced them to watch while he and his friends dined on a feast worthy of kings and discussed various punishments. The table was heavily laden with pheasant, rabbit, peacock and pigeon, yellow wedges of cheese, chunks of coarse black bread with jam and honey, and sweet blackberry tarts. Servants rushed back and forth with widemouthed jugs of dark red wine and additional breaded trenchers piled high with more offerings to tempt their gluttonous appetites.\n There was enough food on the table to feed an army. Watching the three of them eat was such a disgusting sight to Gillian that her hunger pains quickly vanished. She couldn\u0027t make up her mind which one was the most foul. Hugh, with his big protruding ears and pointed chin, kept making grunting noises while he ate, and Edwin, with his triple chins and beady red eyes, had worked himself into a sweat as he frantically shoved fistfuls of greasy meat into his mouth. He acted as though he thought the food would disappear before he could fill his enormous belly, and by the time he paused for air, his face glistened with beads of oily perspiration.\n All three of them were drunk. While she stood there watching, they downed the contents of six jugs of wine and were now waiting while the servant poured more.\n They were like pigs at the trough, but Alford, she decided, was by far the worst offender. Strands of pigeon skin dangled from his lips, and when he shoved a full, plump tart into his cavernous mouth, blackberry juice squirted down on both sides of his chin, staining his red beard black. Too drunk to care about his manners or appearance, he eagerly reached for another.\n Alec stood on her left, near the hearth, watching the spectacle without making a sound. Every now and then his hand would touch hers. As much as she longed to comfort him, she didn\u0027t dare even look at him because Alford was watching her closely. If she showed any concern or affection for the little boy, he\u0027d have a weapon to use against her.\n She had tried to prepare Alec as best she could by warning him that it would get worse before it was over, and she had also made him promise that no matter what happened, he would remain silent. As long as Alford believed the child didn\u0027t understand what he was saying, he would hopefully continue to speak freely in front of him and perhaps say something that would explain his purpose in stealing the boy.\n When she couldn\u0027t stomach watching the animals eat any longer, she turned toward the entrance. She knew she must have played in this hall when she was a little girl, but she didn\u0027t have any memories at all. There was an old chest against the wall near the steps, and she wondered if it had belonged to her parents or if Alford had brought it with him. The top of the chest was cluttered with maps and rolls of parchment, but near the edge was a dagger. Alec had told her the soldier had taken one from him and tossed it on the chest. It was still there. She could see the unusual, intricate design on the handle and was strangely comforted by it. The dagger had been a gift from Alec\u0027s protector, Brodick. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-8.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: \n As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
