She couldn\u0027t afford to lose so much time just to avoid a little pain. Brodick seemed to be reading her mind.\n \"Do these warriors you\u0027ve treated with this mother\u0027s fire of yours stay for days or do they leave?\" he asked.\n \"Oh, they leave once I\u0027ve put the healing salve on the wounds,\" Annie answered.\n \"The ones who can stand leave,\" Kevin interjected.\n Brodick caught Gillian\u0027s barely perceptible nod and then said, \"You will use this warrior\u0027s treatment on Gillian, and she will not make a sound while you\u0027re tending her. She\u0027s a Buchanan.\" He added the last as though that explained everything.\n \"I will not utter a sound, Laird?\" she asked, her voice laced with amusement over his galling arrogance.\n He was serious when he answered. \"Nay, you will not.\"\n She had a sudden urge to start screaming like a wild woman before Annie even touched her just to irritate the pompous man, but she didn\u0027t give in to the desire because the kind woman and little Alec would both become upset. When she was alone with Brodick, however, she was going to remind him that she wasn\u0027t a Buchanan, and she might also add that she was going to thank God for that fact, because the Buchanans were a little too full of themselves. She had noticed that when Brodick announced that she wouldn\u0027t make a sound, every one of his soldiers had nodded.\n Oh, yes, she certainly wanted to scream all right.\n Annie had turned as pale as milk after Brodick chose the treatment to be used. She leaned against her husband and whispered into his ear. Because she spoke so rapidly, Gillian only caught a word or two, but it was quite enough for her to figure out that Annie was asking Kevin for permission to give Gillian a sleeping draft.\n Kevin put the request to Brodick while Annie rushed about the cottage gathering her supplies. Before Brodick could answer, Gillian spoke up. \"I don\u0027t wish to be drugged. I appreciate your concerns, but I must insist on remaining clearheaded so that we may continue on our journey.\"\n Brodick nodded, but Gillian wasn\u0027t certain if he was agreeing with Kevin\u0027s request or with her denial. \"I mean what I say,\" she pressed. \"I don\u0027t want to be drugged.\"\n Alec demanded her attention then by tugging on her sleeve. As she leaned down to him, out of the corner of her eye she saw Annie sprinkle brown powder into a goblet and then add wine.\n \"What is it?\" she asked Alec.\n \"Are you gonna tell on me?\" he whispered.\n \"About the cuts on my arm?\" He bumped her chin when he nodded. \"No, I\u0027m not going to tell, and I want you to stop worrying that I will.\"\n \"All right,\" he said. \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\n \"We\u0027ll get you something to eat in a little while.\"\n \"With your permission, Laird, I would like to toast you and your bride,\" Kevin announced as he carried a tray of goblets to the table.\n \"Oh, but I\u0027m not—\" Gillian began.\n Brodick interrupted her. \"You have my permission.\"\n She frowned at him, puzzled as to why he hadn\u0027t corrected Kevin\u0027s misconception, but decided to wait until later to ask him to explain.\n Kevin put Gillian\u0027s drink in front of her. He then placed the other goblets a good distance away, no doubt so that the drugged wine wouldn\u0027t get mixed up with the others. The toast was but a clever ploy, and though she knew Kevin\u0027s intentions were good-hearted, it still rankled her that he had ignored her wishes. After the toast was given, she would have to take a drink, for otherwise she would be considered rude. That left her only one choice.\n \"May I call your other soldiers inside to share this toast?\" Kevin asked.\n In answer Brodick went to the door and whistled. The sound echoed through the cottage. Less than a minute later, the rest of his soldiers filed inside to take a goblet. Gillian helped by handing one to each man.\n When everyone held a drink, Kevin stepped forward and raised his goblet high.\n \"To a long happy life filled with love and laughter and healthy sons and daughters.\"\n \"Here, here,\" Aaron agreed.\n Everyone waited until Gillian had taken a drink before they downed their wine. Brodick nodded to Annie, pulled out a chair, and straddled it to face Gillian. He motioned for her to put her arm out again, and then put his hand down on top of hers.\n She didn\u0027t have to ask him why he was holding on to her. He was making sure she didn\u0027t pull away during Annie\u0027s treatment.\n Dylan came around the table and placed one hand on her shoulder. \"Robert, take the boy outside,\" he ordered.\n Alec frantically clutched Gillian\u0027s arm. \"I want to stay with you,\" he whispered anxiously.\n \"Then put your request to Dylan,\" she instructed. \"And perhaps he will reconsider, but be polite when you ask him, Alec.\"\n The boy hesitantly looked up at the soldier, craning his neck back as far as it would go. \"Can I stay… please?\"\n \"Milady?\"Dylan asked.\n \"I would be happy for his company.\"\n \"Then you may stay inside for a little while, Alec, but you mustn\u0027t interfere. Can you promise me that you won\u0027t?\"\n Alec nodded. \"I promise,\" he said, then leaned into Gillian.\n Annie stood beside her, watching her closely. She was ready to begin, yet continued to wait. \"Are you feeling a bit sleepy, milady?\" she inquired casually.\n \"Not overly,\" she replied.\n Annie glanced at the laird. \"Perhaps I should wait another minute or two.\"\n Gillian looked up at the men surrounding her and noticed that Annie\u0027s husband was yawning every other minute, but then the soldier named Robert also yawned, and she couldn\u0027t decide which one was actually getting drowsy. Then Kevin began to sway.\n \"Annie, would you please ask your husband to sit down?\"\n Kevin heard her request and, blinking furiously, tried to make sense of it.\"Why would I want to be sitting down, lass?\" he asked.\n \"So you won\u0027t have so far to fall.\"\n No one understood her suggestion until Kevin suddenly pitched forward. Fortunately, one of Brodick\u0027s soldiers was quick on his feet and caught him before his head struck the edge of the table.\n \"Ah, lass, you switched goblets, didn\u0027t you?\" a soldier asked.\n \"She drugged Kevin?\" another soldier asked, grinning.\n Gillian could feel her face burning and concentrated intently on the tabletop while she tried to think of a proper apology to give Kevin\u0027s wife.\n Startled by such trickery, Annie turned to the laird. Brodick shook his head as though in disappointment, but there was a definite sparkle in his eyes and voice when he said, \"It seems Kevin drugged himself. Toss him on the bed, Aaron, and let\u0027s get this done. Annie, we need to be on our way.\"\n She nodded, and with trembling hand she put her knife to Gillian\u0027s arm. Brodick tightened his hold on Gillian\u0027s wrist just before she felt the first prick of the blade cutting through her tender skin. At first Gillian let him know she thought he was overreacting, yet once Annie began to probe the wounds, she was glad for his anchor. The need to flinch was instinctive, but Brodick\u0027s grip wouldn\u0027t allow any movement at all.\n The treatment wasn\u0027t nearly as awful as she had anticipated. Her arm had been throbbing from the pressure of the infection swelling beneath the surface of her inflamed skin, but once the wounds were opened, she felt immediate relief.\n Alec squeezed under her right arm and clung to her. Frightened, he whispered, \"Does it hurt bad?\"\n \"No,\" she answered quietly.\n When he saw how calm she was, the tension eased out of him. Curious, he asked, \"Does it hurt as bad as when that man punched you in the face?\"\n \"Hush, Alec.\"\n \"But does it?\" he pestered.\n She sighed. \"No.\"\n Annie had been cleaning the wounds with clean strips of cloth, but paused when Alec asked the question. \"Someone struck you, milady?\" she asked. The sweet woman looked so appalled, Gillian immediately tried to reassure her.\n \"It was nothing, really,\" she insisted. \"Please don\u0027t concern yourself.\"\n \"This man… who was he?\" Annie asked.\n The room grew deadly quiet while everyone waited to hear her response. She shook her head. \"It isn\u0027t important.\"\n \"Oh, but it is important,\" Dylan said to a chorus of grumbled agreements.\n \"He was an Englishman,\" Alec blurted out.\n Nodding to indicate she didn\u0027t doubt the child\u0027s statement, Annie picked up another cloth and resumed her task of cleaning the wounds. Gillian winced from the discomfort, unaware that she was now gripping Brodick\u0027s hand.\n \"I knew he had to be English,\" Annie grumbled. \"I don\u0027t know of any Highlander who would raise his hand against a woman. Nay, I don\u0027t.\"\n Several soldiers nodded their agreement. Desperate to change the subject, Gillian latched onto the first thought that came into her mind. \"It\u0027s a fine day today, isn\u0027t it? The sun is bright and the wind is mild—\"\n Alec interrupted her. \"The man was drunk, terrible drunk.\"\n \"Alec, no one wants to hear the particulars—\"\n \"Ah, but we do want to hear,\" Brodick drawled out, his mild voice belying what he was truly feeling. He tried to be patient, but his need to hear the full story from start to finish was driving him to distraction. What kind of a madman would prey on such a gentle lady and a little boy? Alec had already painted a dark picture of the horror he\u0027d survived and had let them all see a glimmer of the courage Gillian had shown. Aye, he wanted all the details, and he decided that he would hear the full tale before nightfall.\n \"He was drunk, wasn\u0027t he, Gillian?\" Alec pestered.\n She didn\u0027t answer him, but the boy wasn\u0027t deterred. Since she hadn\u0027t actually forbidden him to talk about the beating, he decided to tell everything he knew.\n \"Uncle Brodick, you know what?\"\n \"No, what?\"\n \"The man, he hit her with his fist and knocked her clear off her feet to the ground, and then you know what he did? He kicked her and kicked her and kicked her. I got real scared, and I tried to make him stop, but he wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"How did you try to make him stop?\" Dylan asked.\n Alec lifted his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he admitted. \"Maybe I cried.\"\n \"Annie, are you almost finished?\" Gillian asked.\n \"Just about,\" the woman answered.\n \"And then you know what? I threw myself on top of Gillian, but she pushed me away, and then you know what she did? She rolled on top of me and put her hands on my head so I wouldn\u0027t get kicked none.\"\n \"What happened then, Alec?\" Liam asked.\n \"She patted me and told me to hush \u0027cause she said it was going to be all right. She wouldn\u0027t let nobody hurt me. She didn\u0027t neither,\" he added. \"I never once got kicked.\"\n Gillian wanted to put her hand over Alec\u0027s mouth. The men looked horrified by what the child was telling them, but their gazes were locked on her. She felt ashamed and embarrassed by what had happened.\n \"Was it just one Englishman who touched Lady Gillian?\" Robert asked. \"Or were there others?\"\n \"Another man hit her,\" Alec said.\n \"Alec, I wish you wouldn\u0027t—\" Gillian began.\n \"But he did hit you, don\u0027t you remember? The man kicked you, and then the other man hit you. How come you don\u0027t remember?\"\n She bowed her head. \"I remember, Alec. I just don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\n The boy turned to Brodick. \"You know what she did after he hit her? She smiled just to make him mad.\"\n Annie gathered up her cloths and put them aside on one of the stools, then spread a thick towel under Gillian\u0027s arm. \"Laird, I\u0027m finished cleaning out the infection.\"\n Brodick nodded. \"The boy\u0027s hungry. He would appreciate a piece of your bread if that isn\u0027t too much trouble.\"\n \"Maybe with honey on it,\" Alec suggested.\n Annie smiled. \"Of course with honey.\"\n \"You must eat it outside,\" Brodick ordered. \"Robert will go with you and see you don\u0027t get into mischief.\"\n \"But, Uncle Brodick, I want to stay with Gillian. She needs me, and she might get lonely.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep her company,\" he promised. \"Robert?\"\n The soldier moved forward. Alec saw him coming around the table and pressed closer to Gillian. She leaned down and whispered, \"I\u0027ll call out to you if I need you.\"\n She had to promise on her mother\u0027s heart before Alec was convinced that she wouldn\u0027t disappear if he left her for a few minutes. Then he snatched the bread from Annie\u0027s hand and ran out the doorway, forgetting in his haste to thank her properly.\n \"He\u0027ll remember his manners later and then thank you,\" Gillian said. \"I appreciate your patience with him. He\u0027s just a little boy and he\u0027s been through a very difficult time.\"\n \"But you got him through it unharmed.\" Dylan made the comment from behind her and once again put his hands on her shoulders. She wasn\u0027t sure if he was offering her praise and comfort or making sure she didn\u0027t try to escape.\n Annie appeared a moment later with an oblong pan of foul-smelling brew she\u0027d heated over the fire. She held the pan with a thick rag she\u0027d wound around the iron handle and tested the warmth of the liquid with the tip of her finger.\n \"It isn\u0027t too hot, milady, but it\u0027s going to hurt something fierce. If you need to scream…\"\n \"She will not make a sound.\" Brodick repeated the comment in a firm, no nonsense voice.\n The arrogant man sounded as though he were stating a fact, and she couldn\u0027t help but be a little perturbed with his highhanded manners. She should be the one to decide if she were going to be brave or not. Why did he think it was his decision to make?\n Annie continued to hover, looking frightened and unsure. Gillian glanced up. \"Why is your treatment called mother\u0027s fire?\"\n She asked the question a scant second before Brodick nodded to the woman and she poured the liquid over Gillian\u0027s open wounds. The pain was instantaneous, horrific, consuming. Her arm felt as though it had been flayed and then dipped in lye. Her skin was on fire, the flames shooting down to her bone. Her response was just as instantaneous. Her stomach lurched, her head spun, and her vision blurred. She would have leapt out of the chair if Dylan and Brodick hadn\u0027t been holding her down. Dear God, the excruciating agony wouldn\u0027t let up. After the first spasm of wrenching pain, her skin began to throb and pulsate, and her arm felt as though hot embers were embedded in her wounds. Arching her back against Dylan, she took deep, gasping breaths, squeezed her eyes shut to hold her tears back, clenched her jaw tight so she wouldn\u0027t scream out loud, and gripped Brodick\u0027s hand with all her might. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-17.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: \n As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
