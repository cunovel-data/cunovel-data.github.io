{"id":76871,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"We\u0027ve come a long way together,\" Waldo said. \"You were such a little girl when we first met. You didn\u0027t speak then.\"\\n\\n \"I remember what my dear friend Liese told me. You came forward to offer your escort on that black day. And now you once again have come to my aid. I will forever be in your debt, and I don\u0027t know how I will ever be able to repay you.\"\\n\\n \"It was an honor for us to help you,\" Henry stammered.\\n\\n Brodick took hold of her arm and pulled her back so she would have to let go of the older brother\u0027s hand. \"We must leave now,\" he demanded, though this time his voice was much more forceful.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she agreed.\\n\\n She turned, spotted Alec in Dylan\u0027s arms, and motioned to the Hathaway brothers to wait. Then she pushed Brodick\u0027s hand away and rushed across the clearing.\\n\\n \"Alec, you will want to say thank you to Waldo and Henry for helping us.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"No, I won\u0027t,\" he said. \"They\u0027re English, so I don\u0027t have to say thank you. Highlanders don\u0027t like the English,\" he added arrogantly.\\n\\n She held her temper. \"Dylan, would you please give Alec and me a moment of privacy?\"\\n\\n \"As you wish, milady.\"\\n\\n As soon as he put Alec down, Gillian latched onto his arm and dragged him toward the trees. Then she leaned down and whispered in his ear while the child squirmed to get away.\\n\\n Dylan turned to Brodick. \"What\u0027s she doing?\" he asked.\\n\\n Brodick smiled. \"Reminding the boy of his manners,\" he answered. He glanced at the two brothers once again, then let out a sigh. \"It seems I have also been reminded.\"\\n\\n Before Dylan could ask him to explain his odd remark, his laird turned toward Waldo and Henry. The brothers were obviously afraid, for both backed away from him until he commanded them to stand still.\\n\\n Dylan couldn\u0027t hear what Brodick was saying to the men, but he saw him reach down and pull his jeweled dirk from the top of his boot and hand it to Waldo. The stunned expression on the Englishman\u0027s face mirrored Dylan\u0027s. He watched as Waldo tried to refuse the gift, but Brodick won the argument.\\n\\n Gillian also saw what was happening and smiled as she continued to instruct Alec in his duty.\\n\\n A moment later, Alec, deliberately dragging his feet, made his way across the clearing to speak to the Englishmen. Gillian gave him a little push between the shoulder blades to get him to quicken his step.\\n\\n Alec lowered his chin to his chest and stood next to Brodick when he addressed Waldo and Henry. \"I thank you, \u0027cause you both watched out for me,\" he said.\\n\\n \"And?\"Gillian prodded.\\n\\n \"And \u0027cause you didn\u0027t have to but you did anyway.\"\\n\\n Exasperated, she said, \"Alec means to say that he is sorry he was a bother, Waldo and Henry. He also knows that the two of you put your lives at risk for him. Isn\u0027t that right, Alec?\"\\n\\n The child nodded and then took hold of Gillian\u0027s hand as he watched Waldo and Henry take their leave.\\n\\n \"Did I say it right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you did just fine.\"\\n\\n Dylan lifted Alec onto his mount and then turned to his laird. \"Has she told you what happened or how she and Alec ended up together?\"\\n\\n Brodick swung up onto his stallion\u0027s back before answering. \"No, she hasn\u0027t told me anything yet, but she will. Be patient, Dylan. Right now it\u0027s more important to get her and the boy away from the MacDonalds. Once I know they\u0027re safe, and I don\u0027t have to keep looking over my shoulder, I\u0027ll get her explanation. Tell Liam to take the lead,\" he commanded. \"We\u0027re going to Kevin Drummond\u0027s cottage before we head north. Robert will take the rear to watch our backs.\"\\n\\n \"The Drummonds are several hours out of our way,\" Dylan said. \"It\u0027ll be sunset before we get there.\"\\n\\n \"I know where the man lives,\" he countered. \"But Kevin\u0027s wife is well known for her healing ways, and Gillian\u0027s arm needs attention.\"\\n\\n Gillian stood in the center of the clearing, shivering from the cold while she patiently waited for the men to finish discussing her. It was apparent she was their topic, for they both frowned at her while they conversed with one another. The summer sun beat down on her face, but she was getting more chilled by the minute, and every muscle in her body ached. She knew it wasn\u0027t just fatigue, and, dear God, there wasn\u0027t time now for her to get sick. She needed every minute of every day before the fall festival to search for her sister. Oh, it all seemed so hopeless. She shouldn\u0027t have lied to Alford by telling him that her sister had King John\u0027s precious box. How was she ever going to find it when every soldier in the kingdom had searched for the treasure at one time or another over the past fifteen years? Could Christen still have it with her? Alford seemed to think she did, and Gillian had fueled his belief because at the time Alec had been in terrible danger. In her heart she knew the box was gone forever, and now she felt she was weighed down in a quagmire and sinking rapidly.\\n\\n She did have a fragment of a plan. Once she got Alec home, she was going to plead with his father for assistance in getting her to the MacPherson holding, where Christen was reported to be living. And then what? she thought. Her mind was filled with unanswerable questions, and she prayed she would be able to sort it all out when she was feeling better.\\n\\n Rubbing her arms to ward off her chills, she forced herself to think about the present. Brodick nudged his mount toward her. He didn\u0027t slow the stallion\u0027s gait as he approached. He leaned to the side and, with little effort, wrapped his arm around her waist and swept her onto his lap.\\n\\n She adjusted her skirts to cover her knees and tried to sit straight so her back wouldn\u0027t touch his chest, but Brodick wouldn\u0027t let her maintain any formality. He tightened his hold and hauled her up against him.\\n\\n In truth, she was thankful for his warmth, and his masculine scent appealed to her. He smelled like the outdoors. She wanted to close her eyes and rest for just a few minutes and maybe even pretend this nightmare was all over. She didn\u0027t dare give in to the foolish fantasy though, because she needed to keep a watchful eye on Alec.\\n\\n She turned in Brodick\u0027s arms and looked up at him. He was really quite handsome, she thought, forgetting for the moment what she wanted to say to him. She had heard stories about the Viking warriors who roamed England centuries before and thought Brodick was surely a descendant, for he was as huge as the Vikings were reputed to be. His bone structure was well-defined from his high cheekbones to his gently squared chin. Aye, he was handsome all right and had surely caused many a lady to lose her heart. That thought led to another. Alec had told her Brodick wasn\u0027t married, but did the laird have a sweetheart at home waiting for him to return?\\n\\n \"Is something wrong, lass?\"\\n\\n \"Could Alec ride with us? We could make room for him.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n She waited a full minute for him to explain why he had denied her request, then realized he had said all he was going to say. His manner was distant, but she tried not to take offense. Her Uncle Morgan had often told her that the Highlanders were a different breed of men and danced to what he called their own strange tune, and she therefore assumed that Brodick wasn\u0027t actually trying to be rude. His abruptness was simply part of who he was.\\n\\n She leaned back against him and tried to relax, but every so often, she looked behind him to make certain Alec was all right.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re almost there,\" Brodick said. \"You\u0027re going to get a stiff neck if you keep looking back every other minute. Alec\u0027s fine,\" he insisted. \"Dylan isn\u0027t going to let anything happen to him.\" With that, he shoved her head down on his shoulder. \"Rest,\" he ordered.\\n\\n And so she did just that.\\n\\n Chapter Seven\\n\\n Brodick shook Gillian awake when they reached their destination.\\n\\n She pulled herself from her slumber and rubbed the stiffness in her neck. It took some effort, but she finally forced her eyes to focus, and for a brief moment she thought she was still dreaming. Where was she? What was this place? Lush green hills surrounded her. A narrow stream gently meandered down the slope and in the center of the green valley sat a gray stone cottage with a thatched roof. The yard on either side was ablaze with wild-flowers of every color in the rainbow, their perfumed scent floating around her. Birch trees flanked the clear-water stream that flowed on the west side of the cottage, and to the east was a broad meadow blanketed in a thick carpet of grass. A flock of sheep, ready for shearing, clustered together at the far end of the field, bleating at one another like gossiping women, while a rather regal-looking guard dog sat on his haunches with his head held high, eyes ever watchful as he surveyed his charges. Smoke gently curled up into the cloudless blue sky from the cottage chimney. A faint breeze touched Gillian\u0027s cheek. This was a paradise.\\n\\n A shout shook her from her musings. A tall, thin-faced man stood on the front step of the cottage and was smiling and calling to the approaching soldiers. As she watched the men disappear through the doorway, everything that had happened in the last few days flooded back to her memory.\\n\\n Dylan had Alec on his shoulders and was bending down to go inside. Brodick had already dismounted but was waiting to assist Gillian. When at last she turned to him, he reached for her and she slid into his arms. For a fleeting moment their eyes met, and she studied the face of this man she hardly knew and yet trusted with her life. His piercing eyes made her think he knew all her secrets. She tried to shake herself out of such foolish thoughts. He was just a man, nothing more—and he needed to shave. His cheeks and jaw were covered with golden brown whiskers, and she had the insane urge to find out what it would feel like to run her fingers down the side of his face.\\n\\n \"Why are you staring at me?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"The same reason you\u0027re staring at me, lass.\"\\n\\n From the sparkle in his eyes, she guessed he had a bit of the Devil in him and she simply wasn\u0027t up to the task of being clever or flirtatious. She wasn\u0027t even sure she knew how.\\n\\n She pushed his hands away from her waist and stepped back. \"Why have we stopped here? And who was that man in the doorway? Alec shouldn\u0027t have gone inside until I—\"\\n\\n He cut her off. \"This is the last time I\u0027m going to tell you that Alec is safe with Dylan. He would be highly insulted to know you don\u0027t trust him.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t trust him,\" she whispered so the other soldiers wouldn\u0027t overhear. \"I don\u0027t know him.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know me either,\" he pointed out. \"But you\u0027ve decided to trust me, and you therefore have to believe that what I tell you is true. My soldiers will protect Alec with their lives.\" The briskness in his voice indicated he was finished discussing the subject.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m too weary to argue.\"\\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t. It\u0027s pointless to argue with a Buchanan,\" he added. \"You can\u0027t possibly win, lass. We Buchanans never lose.\"\\n\\n She thought he might be jesting, but she couldn\u0027t be absolutely sure, and so she didn\u0027t laugh. Either he had a very strange sense of humor or he was sinfully arrogant.\\n\\n \"Come along. We\u0027re wasting time,\" he said as he caught hold of her hand and started up the stone path.\\n\\n \"Are we going to spend the night here?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t bother to turn around when he answered. \"No, we\u0027ll move on after Annie tends to your arm.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to be a bother.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll be honored to serve you.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"She thinks you\u0027re my bride,\" he explained.\\n\\n \"Why would she think that? I only told the lie to one MacDonald soldier.\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"News travels fast, and everyone knows the MacDonalds can\u0027t keep secrets.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear, I\u0027ve caused you considerable trouble, haven\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he answered.\\n\\n When they reached the doorway, he stepped back to let her go inside first. She moved close to him and asked in a whisper, \"Do you trust these people?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"As much as I trust anyone who isn\u0027t a Buchanan,\" he answered. \"Kevin Drummond\u0027s sister is married to one of my soldiers, so he\u0027s considered kin of a sort. Anything you say in front of them will be held in confidence.\"\\n\\n Dylan introduced her to the couple. Annie Drummond stood near the hearth and bowed low to Gillian. She was about her age and was heavy with child. Kevin Drummond also bowed and welcomed her into his home. Both of them, Gillian thought, appeared to be extremely nervous.\\n\\n Their cottage was small and smelled of freshly baked bread. An oblong table took up a good deal of space in the center of the room and from the number of chairs, six in all, Gillian assumed the Drummonds were used to entertaining visitors. It was a home, warm and comfortable and inviting, the kind of place Gillian dreamed of when she allowed herself to fantasize about falling in love and having a family. Such a foolish notion, she thought to herself. Her life was consumed with worry now, and there wasn\u0027t room for such yearnings.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a privilege to have you in our home,\" Kevin told her, but his eyes, she noticed, were fully directed on Brodick.\\n\\n After formally greeting the laird, Annie suggested Gillian take a seat at the table and let her have a look at her injury. She pulled a chair out on the opposite side and waited for Gillian to get comfortable. Then she spread a cloth on the tabletop while Gillian pushed up her sleeve and unwrapped the bandage.\\n\\n \"I would appreciate any medicine you have,\" she said. \"It isn\u0027t a serious injury, but I believe it\u0027s become a bit inflamed.\"\\n\\n Gillian didn\u0027t think her arm looked all that bad, but Annie visibly blanched when she saw it.\\n\\n \"Ah, lass, you must be in terrible pain.\"\\n\\n Brodick and his men moved forward to look at the injury. Alec ran to Gillian and pressed against her. He looked scared.\\n\\n \"How in heaven\u0027s name did this happen?\" Dylan asked.\\n\\n \"I cut myself.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got to be opened and drained,\" Annie whispered. \"Laird, you\u0027re going to have to stay with us a couple of days at the least while I tend to this. She\u0027s a lady,\" she added, \"and I must therefore use the slow method of curing her.\"\\n\\n \"No, I cannot stay that long,\" Gillian protested.\\n\\n \"If she were a man? What would you do then?\" Brodick asked.\\n\\n Thinking he\u0027d asked the question out of simple curiosity, Annie replied, \"I\u0027d open the skin and drain the infection, but then I would pour mother\u0027s fire on the open wound, and though the special brew has cured everything I\u0027ve ever used it on, it causes terrible pain.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen warriors shout during Annie\u0027s treatment with her mother\u0027s fire,\" Kevin said.\\n\\n Brodick waited for Gillian to decide which method would be used. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-16.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
