I\u0027ve just heard that there is a lady here from England, and I must make her acquaintance.\"\n \"Why must you?\" Brodick asked.\n She jumped at the bark in his voice but quickly recovered. \"Because I\u0027ve never been to England,\" she explained. \"And I have a thousand questions to ask her. I\u0027m curious to know what life is like in England, and she is the only one who can tell me. I cannot imagine living anywhere but here, and I find myself wondering if she feels the same way about her home in England. I have already decided that I will like her,\" she added.\n \"Yes, you will,\" he predicted.\n \"You have much in common with Lady Gillian,\" Ramsey remarked. \"You\u0027re both stubborn women.\"\n \"Is she being forced to marry, then?\" Bridgid asked, unable to mask her irritation.\n Ramsey took a step toward her. \"No one is forcing you to marry, Bridgid.\"\n \"Then may I please be excused?\"\n \"No, you may not,\" Ramsey snapped. \"About this Matthias…\"\n Impatiently settling her hands on her hips, she asked, \"Are we back to that?\"\n \"Bridgid, I warn you, I will not tolerate insolence.\"\n She was immediately contrite. \"I\u0027m sorry. I know I spoke out of turn, but I have already declined the offer.\"\n Ramsey didn\u0027t want to give up. \"Do you realize how many requests you\u0027ve turned down?\"\n \"Yes, I do.\"\n \"You\u0027ve broken many hearts.\"\n \"I doubt that, Laird. None of those men know me well enough to have their hearts broken. If I could get them to stop asking, I assure you I would. It\u0027s very upsetting for me to have to go through this audience again and again. \u0027Tis the truth I\u0027m beginning to dread…\"\n \"Dread what?\" he asked when she abruptly stopped.\n Her face turned pink with embarrassment. \"Never mind,\" she said.\n \"You may speak freely. Now tell me, what is it you dread?\"\n \"The sight of you,\" she blurted. \"The only time you speak to me is when you want me to hear a proposal. I know how distressing this is for you. You don\u0027t wish to waste your valuable time on such inconsequential matters.\"\n \"You are not inconsequential.\"\n \"But I am difficult, aren\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yes, you are.\"\n \"Are we finished now?\"\n \"No, we are not. Bridgid, don\u0027t you want to get married?\"\n \"Of course I do. I want children,\" she said, her voice fervent now. \"Lots of children, and I\u0027m going to love them the way a mother should.\"\n \"Then why have you declined so many requests? If you want to have children—\"\n She wouldn\u0027t let him finish. \"I love another.\"\n The announcement took Ramsey by surprise. \"You do?\"\n \"Yes, I do.\"\n \"Who is this man?\"\n She shook her head. \"I cannot say his name.\"\n \"Then marry him,\" he suggested impatiently.\n She sighed. \"He hasn\u0027t asked me.\"\n \"Does he know how you feel?\"\n \"No, he doesn\u0027t. He\u0027s a very stupid man.\"\n Brodick did laugh then, he couldn\u0027t help it. \"Yet you love him?\" he asked.\n She smiled as she answered. \"I do. I don\u0027t want to love him, but I do, with all my heart. I must be as stupid as he is. That is the only excuse I can give. Matters of the heart are most perplexing, and I\u0027m not smart enough to sort them all out.\" Turning to Ramsey again, she said, \"I will not have Matthias. I won\u0027t settle for any man I don\u0027t love.\"\n Ramsey\u0027s reaction to her announcement puzzled him. When she had admitted she loved another man and therefore wouldn\u0027t accept Matthias, he was at first surprised, but that feeling was quickly replaced by what he could only describe as irritation. Though he couldn\u0027t figure out why, the thought of her loving someone didn\u0027t sit well with him. His reaction didn\u0027t make any sense. Here he was trying to persuade her to marry Matthias, and if she had agreed, would he have had the same disappointment? No, he thought, and all because he knew she would never agree.\n Shaking himself out of his confusing thoughts, he said, \"Tell me who the man is and I will speak to him on your behalf.\"\n \"I thank you for your suggestion to help, but the man I love must decide without interference.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t making a suggestion. I was giving an order. Tell me his name.\"\n He took another step forward, but Bridgid stood her ground. It wasn\u0027t easy. Ramsey was such a big man his nearness was overwhelming, and she had to remind herself that as her laird, it was his duty to protect her, not harm her. She was a loyal member of his family, and like it or not, he had to look out for her best interests. Besides, she knew him to be a kind, generous man. He might scare the breath out of her, but he would never raise a hand against her.\n She decided to try to turn his attention in hopes he wouldn\u0027t notice she hadn\u0027t answered his demand. \"Laird, where\u0027s Michael? I haven\u0027t seen him today, and I had promised him some time ago that I would take him tree climbing.\"\n \"Tree climbing?\"\n \"All boys should know how to climb a tree.\"\n \"And you think you could show him how it\u0027s done?\"\n She slowly nodded.\n \"He\u0027s staying with the Maitlands,\" he said. \"He and Alec have become good friends, but when Michael returns home, you won\u0027t be showing him how to climb a tree. It\u0027s unladylike, Bridgid.\"\n \"I suppose it is,\" she agreed reluctantly.\n Ramsey once again demanded the name of the man she had declared she loved.\n Disgruntled because her ploy to make him forget the question hadn\u0027t worked, she said, \"I don\u0027t wish to tell you his name, Laird.\"\n \"That much is obvious,\" he replied. \"But you\u0027re still going to tell me.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not.\"\n He couldn\u0027t believe she had the audacity to defy him. \"I\u0027m not going to give up,\" he warned. \"Tell me his name.\"\n The man was as relentless as a dog chasing after a cat, and she had no one to blame but herself because she had foolishly told him what was in her heart.\n \"You have an unfair advantage,\" she said.\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"You\u0027re Laird,\" she said. \"You can speak freely, while I—\"\n He wouldn\u0027t let her finish. \"You\u0027ve been speaking freely since the moment you came inside. Now answer my question.\"\n His voice had a definite bite to it, and she flinched. She didn\u0027t know how she was going to get out of the corner he had backed her into.\n \"Unless you order me to…\"\n \"I\u0027ve already ordered you to give me his name,\" he reminded her.\n His curtness embarrassed her. She lowered her head so he wouldn\u0027t see her face and said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I cannot tell you his name.\"\n Ramsey gave up and decided to let the matter go for now. He was disgusted with himself. It wasn\u0027t like him to let his temper flare with a woman. Yet, this particular woman did try his patience.\n \"Is it a sin to defy you, Laird?\" she asked.\n The question gave him pause. \"No, of course not.\"\n She smiled again. \"That\u0027s good.\"\n He let her see his irritation. \"You know damn good and well it isn\u0027t.\"\n Ignoring his comment, she said, \"I\u0027ve taken up too much of your valuable time. With your permission, I shall take my leave now.\"\n She curtsied and tried to leave but he stopped her with his next remark. \"If you\u0027re not going to marry Matthias, then there is another matter I wish to speak to you about.\"\n \"There is?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n She waited, but Ramsey couldn\u0027t seem to get the words out. How could he crush her by telling her that her mother didn\u0027t want her? He couldn\u0027t do it.\n \"I seem to have forgotten…\"\n Brodick came to his aid. \"Michael.\"\n Ramsey glanced at his friend. \"Michael?\"\n Brodick nodded. \"You were telling me you were going to ask Bridgid to help you with your brother because of his tender years, remember?\"\n Ramsey leapt at the idea. \"Yes, that was it. Now I remember. Michael\u0027s with the Maitlands now.\"\n \"Yes, Laird, you already told me he was visiting with his friend.\"\n \"Yes, I did,\" he said, feeling like an idiot. \"But when he comes home…\"\n \"Yes?\"\n Ramsey looked to Brodick for help.\n \"Ramsey doesn\u0027t have time to devote to his brother, and he also feels that Michael needs a woman\u0027s influence.\"\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" Ramsey agreed. They were both making up the story as they went along, but Bridgid didn\u0027t seem to notice.\n \"I would be happy to help with Michael.\"\n \"Then it\u0027s settled.\"\n \"What\u0027s settled? What exactly do you want me to do?\"\n \"Move in here,\" he explained. \"There are three empty chambers upstairs. Choose one and move your things in as soon as possible. You\u0027re going to have to leave your home, of course, and I know that it will be difficult for your mother and you,\" he added, proud of the fact that he hadn\u0027t choked on the lie.\n \"You want me to live here? Laird, it wouldn\u0027t be proper. People would talk.\"\n \"Then sleep with the servants in the quarters behind the castle.\"\n She contemplated him for several seconds without saying a word, then slowly nodded. The sadness he saw in her eyes was heartbreaking, and it was then that he realized she understood everything.\n Straightening her shoulders, she took a deep breath and said, \"I\u0027ll be happy to help with Michael, but shouldn\u0027t I wait until he returns home before I move my clothes?\"\n \"No, I want you to get settled as soon as possible.\"\n \"Then if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll get my things now.\"\n Ramsey granted her permission and watched her walk away. Her proud bearing impressed him, more so because he had seen the tears brimming in her eyes before she turned her back to him.\n She paused at the entrance and called out, \"Laird?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"Don\u0027t judge my mother too harshly. She cannot help the way she feels. She\u0027s newly married and wishes privacy with her husband. I\u0027m in the way. Besides, it\u0027s time that I left home.\"\n \"Do you think that\u0027s the reason I asked you to move in here? Because your mother wants privacy?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it?\" she asked. \"What other reason could there be?\"\n Lust and jealousy, Ramsey thought, but he wasn\u0027t about to tell her the shameful truth, that her stepfather lusted after her and her own mother was jealous of her daughter\u0027s beauty.\n \"I\u0027ve explained my reason. You will help with Michael, and that\u0027s all there is to it.\"\n \"You\u0027re a kind man, Laird,\" she said. \"But…\"\n \"But what?\"\n Her smile was fleeting. \"You really don\u0027t lie all that well.\"\n Chapter Twenty-One\n Nothing was ever easy. After a long and tedious conversation with Brisbane and Otis, Gillian\u0027s head was pounding from all of their evasive answers. They were sweet, gentle men, but terribly stubborn. Though neither one of them would admit it to her, it soon became apparent that, while they knew where Christen was, they weren\u0027t going to tell until they had spoken to her and gained her permission. Gillian tried to be patient and was finally rewarded when Otis accidentally let it slip that Christen did live on MacPherson land. Gillian\u0027s heart leapt with joy, and she began to prod them relentlessly, but to no avail.\n So certain was Gillian that Christen would come running as soon as she heard her sister was there, she agreed to wait until the men had talked to her. She begged them to speak to Christen as soon as possible, explaining that time was running out and that she must return to England soon. She didn\u0027t tell them why.\n Feeling edgy and frustrated after the elders took their leave, Gillian wanted to be alone for a few minutes, and so she took a walk along the stone path that meandered among the buildings of Ramsey\u0027s holding. Reaching the top of a hill, she found a shady spot under a tree and sat down. She spread her skirts over the soft tufts of grass and then closed her eyes and cleared her mind, letting the mild, sweet breeze brush against her face. When she opened her eyes again, she took a long look around her. Ramsey\u0027s estate was beautiful… and peaceful. Beneath her, the people of his clan carried on the daily routine of their lives. Soldiers sharpened their weapons, while other men bent over their tools, tilling the land for their next crop. Women sat in doorways visiting as they ground the grain for their next loaves of bread, and their children skipped nearby, playing a rambunctious game with a large smooth stone and a stick.\n For a brief moment, she was at peace too, taking in the tranquillity of the scene. But then her mind wouldn\u0027t let her rest. It raced with all the questions she wanted to ask Christen when she saw her again. She prayed that her sister would remember her, and that her memories would be fond ones. Liese had kept Christen\u0027s memory alive with amusing stories about the two of them. She told them over and over again so that Gillian wouldn\u0027t forget her sister. Christen didn\u0027t have anyone to help her remember, but Gillian hoped that, because she was older, she wouldn\u0027t have forgotten.\n A woman\u0027s shout pulled her from her thoughts, and Gillian turned around just as a young, fair-haired lady came running up the path. Her brow was wrinkled by distress, and Gillian soon understood the reason why, for hot on her trail was a big brute of a man with a look of determination gleaming in his eyes. On closer inspection, she realized the brute was more boy than man.\n \"I\u0027ve told you to leave me alone, Stewart, and I mean what I say. If you don\u0027t stop pestering me, I\u0027ll…\"\n She stopped suddenly when she spotted Gillian. Almost immediately, she smiled and hurried forward, oblivious now to her unwanted suitor. Stewart stopped and backed away to listen.\n \"Good day, milady.\"\n \"Good day to you,\" Gillian replied.\n \"My name\u0027s Bridgid,\" she said as she curtsied haphazardly. \"Don\u0027t get up,\" she added. \"You\u0027re the lady from England, aren\u0027t your?\"\n \"Yes,\" she answered. \"My name\u0027s Gillian.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been searching everywhere for you,\" she said. \"I was hoping that if you weren\u0027t too busy, you would take a few minutes to answer my questions about England. I\u0027m very curious about the people who live there.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-37.html","bookId":1843,"book":{"id":1843,"title":"Ransom (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #2)","description":"Storyline: \n As a child, Gillian lost her sister and saw her father killed by Baron Alford, a man driven by greed, determined to obtain a jewelled box belonging to King John.
