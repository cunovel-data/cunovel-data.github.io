{"id":91560,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Betrayed The elven camp was astir the next morning, the revitalized elves eager to find enemies to battle. Cadderly, Danica, and Rufo tried their best to keep out of the way as the fair folk rushed about, resupplying their patrol groups with rope and arrows. \"I am going with Elbereth in his hunt,\" Danica insisted to her two friends. \"Wizards are not such a threat to one of my training.\" \"You do not even know if Elbereth is going at all,\" Cadderly retorted. Indeed, in the central cave before them, the elf prince and his father were engaged in a terrible argument. \"Elbereth will go as he promised,\" remarked Shayleigh, who, looking much better than she had before Daoine Teague Feer, approached the friends. \"Just as he went in to King Galladel this day to argue the value of last night\u0027s celebration. The whispers say the king was not pleased that Elbereth presided over Daoine Teague Feer.\" As if to accentuate the maiden\u0027s point, several loud shouts echoed out of the cave. Shayleigh shook her head and walked away. She could not go out on patrol this day, but those tending her agreed that she would not be much longer in healing. Cadderly considered the noise from the cave in light of Shayleigh\u0027s words. He knew that Danica would not listen to him; the monk was as headstrong as he. \"If you are going, then so am I,\" the young scholar said. Danica scowled at him. \"You are not trained in stealth,\" she said. \"You may hinder us and endanger us.\" \"Priests have measures to counter a wizard\u0027s powers,\" Kierkan Rufo reminded her. Danica balked. \"You intend to go as well?\" \"Not I,\" Rufo assured her. \"I did not come here to do battle, and the elves will be better for it if I do not!\" His admission did little to diminish Danica\u0027s scowl. Her continued dislike of the angular man was obvious. \"I will do what I must,\" said Cadderly. \"By word of Dean Thobicus, I am the leader of our party. If you choose to go with Elbereth, I will not stop you, but I must go beside you.\" \"I am not of your order,\" she reminded Cadderly, \"nor am I bound to your library.\" \"To disobey Dean Thobicus would prevent you from ever returning there,\" Cadderly warned, \"would prevent you from resuming your studies of Penpahg D\u0027Ahn.\" Danica\u0027s glower intensified, but she gave no retort. Elbereth came out of Galladel\u0027s chambers then, his face flushed with anger. He mellowed when he saw Danica and the others, and came straight over to join them. \"Your father is not pleased with you,\" Danica remarked. \"He never is,\" said Elbereth, managing a weak smile, \"but we share respect, and do not doubt our love.\" Cadderly did not doubt, and that left him with a hollow, empty feeling. He would have liked to have had a father, if only to argue with the man! \"Are you to join any patrols this day?\" Danica asked. \"I will scout alone,\" the elf prince replied, looking to the dark forest spread below them. \"I must find and destroy the wizard before more harm is done.\" \"You will not be alone,\" said Danica. Elbereth understood her intent as soon as he looked into her brown, almond-shaped eyes. He did not appear pleased. \"Danica and I wish to go with you,\" Cadderly explained. Many expressions crossed Elbereth\u0027s face as he considered the unexpected request. \"I will not be riding,\" he said at length, \"and I expect to pass far beyond the closest lines of goblins.\" \"More the reason to have companions,\" said Cadderly. \"Perhaps,\" the elf admitted, eyeing Danica more carefully. Elbereth certainly couldn\u0027t deny the young woman\u0027s value if it came to battle. \"And none of my own people might be spared,\" he said, \"but I can offer no guaran - \" \"We need no guarantees,\" Cadderly assured him. \"We understand the dangers.\" The young scholar flashed his boyish smile at Elbereth, and then to Danica. \"Consider it repayment for Daoine Teague Feer.\" That thought touched Elbereth, and he soon agreed that the two could accompany him. He told them that an elven warrior would also leave for the Edificant Library, an emissary asking for aid, and that they or Rufo were welcome to go along with that elf if they so chose. \"You have heard our choice,\" Danica insisted. \"And I cannot go,\" Kierkan Rufo stammered, coming back over when he heard his name. \"Back to the library, I mean.\" Danica looked at the angular man curiously, thinking it would be more to Rufo\u0027s character to simply run away. Cadderly congratulated his fellow priest on his brave decision to remain in Shilmista. Danica was too suspicious to agree. In truth, Rufo would have liked nothing better than to go back with the elven emissary, but he dared not miss a certain meeting he had arranged the previous night. \"A wise decision,\" the imp said, again from behind, when Rufo came down from the hill shortly after sunset. Rufo spun on him angrily. \"You left me with little choice,\" he growled, his volume causing Druzil to look around nervously. \"Follow!\" the imp commanded, thinking it prudent that they get as far from the enchanted hill as possible. He led Rufo through the dark trees to the appointed meeting place with Dorigen. Rufo was surprised to find a woman before him, a not-unattractive woman, though she was older than he and sported a severely crooked nose. The wizard and Rufo stared at each other for a long while, neither moving to begin the conversation. Finally, Rufo could bear the suspense no longer. \"You called me out here,\" he protested. Dorigen let her stare linger a bit longer, let Rufo shift uncomfortably from one foot to the other several times before offering any explanation. \"I need information,\" she eventually replied. \"You would ask me to betray my companions?\" Rufo asked, trying to sound incredulous. \"Perhaps I should go back. . . .\" \"Do not sound so surprised,\" Dorigen scolded. \"You understood the purpose of this meeting before you ever agreed to it.\" \"I only agreed because I was left with no choice,\" Rufo argued. \"You are left with no choice again,\" Dorigen said coldly. \"Consider yourself my prisoner, if that might ease your pitiful conscience. I need information, Kierkan Rufo, he who aided Barjin. . . .\" Rufo\u0027s eyes widened in disbelief. \"Yes, I know who you are,\" Dorigen continued, thinking she had gained the upper hand. \"You were Barjin\u0027s pawn, and so you shall be mine!\" \"No!\" Rufo roared, but when he turned to leave, he found himself facing Druzil\u0027s poison-tipped tail. The angular priest\u0027s bluster flew away in the blink of an eye. \"Do not be angry, dear man,\" Dorigen purred. \"I have done you a favor, though you do not yet understand that. The forest is doomed, and so, too, are all who fight beside the elves.\" \"Then why do you need me?\" Rufo asked. \"That does not concern the war,\" Dorigen replied. She paused for a moment to discern how she might explain without giving away too much. \"Consider it a personal matter, between me and those who accompanied you to Shilmista.\" \"The elf prince?\" Rufo asked. \"Perhaps,\" Dorigen answered slyly, thinking it best that Rufo be kept guessing. Not wanting to lose momentum, she pressed on again, her amber eyes flickering with growing delight. \"It does not matter. I offer you survival, Kierkan Rufo. When I claim victory, your life will be spared. You might even find a place among my ranks of advisors.\" Rufo appeared intrigued, but not convinced. \"And if the elves should somehow escape, and your friends along with them,\" Dorigen added, \"then none will know of your deceit and still you will emerge with nothing lost.\" \"And if I refuse?\" \"Must I go into the unpleasant details?\" Dorigen replied, her voice so calm and even-toned that it sent shivers up Rufo\u0027s spine. \"Oh, I might not kill you now,\" Dorigen continued. \"No, it would be a sweeter thing to see you dishonored for your actions beside Barjin, to lay public those deeds you committed in the library\u0027s cellar.\" Dorigen enjoyed the way Rufo squirmed, and she gave Druzil an approving nod for supplying her with such valuable information. \"How do you know about that?\" Rufo asked, as though he had read her thoughts. \"I am not without my sources.\" Dorigen stated the obvious. \"And do not think that your torment shall end with disgrace,\" she went on, her voice taking a distinctly evil edge. \"After your humiliation has ebbed, I will have you killed in time. Consider the life you will lead if you disappoint me now, Kierkan Rufo. Consider years of looking over your shoulder for assassins.\" Rufo again shifted from foot to foot. \"And know that your grave will not be sanctified by the Edificant Library, for certainly your indiscretions with Barjin shall come out in full I will see to it that they are not easily forgotten to dishonor you even in death.\" The weight of the threat lay heavy on the angular man, both because of the deadly imp just a few feet behind him and the fact that he was indeed vulnerable to the wizard\u0027s accusations. \"But let us not focus on such unpleasantness,\" Dorigen offered. \"I require very little of you, and then you may go on your way, secure that whatever the outcome of this war, you will be safe.\" Rufo could hardly believe the words as they escaped his thin lips. \"What do you wish to know?\" Cadderly felt clumsy, crunching through the brush beside the stealthy Danica and Elbereth. He did not regret his decision to accompany the two, though, and neither of them gave more than a slight frown at the young scholar\u0027s loudest crackles. They had passed several goblin and orc encampments, the creatures sleeping under the light of day, with the exception of a few bleary-eyed and hardly alert guards. Elbereth\u0027s planned destination was the same grove in which the wizard had appeared, where Ralmarith had been killed. The elf prince hoped he could pick up the trail from there. He never would have imagined that finding Dorigen could be so easy. They had believed their progress exceptional, for they had moved unhindered long after dusk. The forest grew quiet around them as they rested. Too quiet. Elbereth sat regarding his sword. \"I had thought to bloody it before now,\" he whispered to the others. \"I did not expect that the resistance would be so meager. Perhaps our enemies are not as many as we have been led to believe.\" Cadderly had a sickening thought. \"Or perhaps . . .\" he began, but he never got the chance to finish the sentence, for Elbereth, detecting movement in the thick brush to the west of their hasty camp, motioned for silence and crept away. Danica, too, went on the alert, only she crouched low and turned toward the snap of a twig in the shadows to the east. \"I have a bad feeling,\" Cadderly remarked. He quickly loaded a dart on his crossbow and took up his spindle-disks in his other hand. \"Ogres!\" cried Elbereth. Cadderly spun about to see the elf engaged with two of the gigantic creatures. Danica disappeared into the brush back to the east, forcing Cadderly\u0027s attention. He turned again just in time to see an ogre bearing down on him, a net held wide in its long arms. Ten ogre strides away, the monster lurched suddenly, as Danica burst out of the brush and rammed her shoulder against the inside of the monster\u0027s knee. Cadderly heard the crack of the huge bone, but the ogre remained standing, though dazed until Danica came charging back in, leaped high in the air, and double-kicked it in the chest. It flew down into a patch of brambles. Danica had no time to finish it off; a group of orogs appeared, and orcs beside them. Danica went into a fighting fury, spinning and kicking as the creatures flowed around her. An orc was the first to get to Cadderly. The young scholar leveled his crossbow to blast it away, but wisely decided to hold that shot until sheer desperation forced it. As the orc came in, slowly now, measuring its enemy, Cadderly set his spindle-disks spinning down to the length of their string. Cadderly was not well-versed in the orcish tongue, but he had picked up a few words and phrases from his readings. \"Watch!\" he said to the orc, trying to sound excited, and he sent the disks into a wide, looping circuit. The orc did watch, almost mesmerized. Cadderly snapped the disks back into his hand, continued his arm\u0027s circular motion to confuse the stupid monster, and waded ahead a long stride. The orc\u0027s head went back up, expecting the disks to go flying up into the air. Cadderly snapped them straight out instead, where they slammed under the orc\u0027s raised chin and into the creature\u0027s exposed throat. It went down on its back, clutching at its crushed windpipe. Cadderly had barely registered that the orc was down when he heard a rush behind him. He spun and fired his crossbow point blank into an orog that had charged in to tackle him. The dart hit the mark and exploded, but the heavy creature slammed into Cadderly anyway and bore him to the ground. Cadderly struggled and thrashed for many moments before he realized that the orog\u0027s chest was blown wide open and that the creature was quite dead. Elbereth spent a long time parrying, keeping out of the huge ogres\u0027 tremendous reach and the paths of their monstrous clubs. For some reason, the monsters seemed to be only half-swinging, as though they didn\u0027t want to crush the elf completely. Elbereth wasn\u0027t about to let them hit him in any case. An orc sprang up from a bush to the side, just a couple of feet from Elbereth, and readied to throw a net. Elbereth was quicker, though, and his side-cut opened a gash in the monster\u0027s face and sent it tumbling. The battle had begun in full behind the elf he heard one of Cadderly\u0027s darts go off and he knew that he could afford no more delays. He waited for the exact moment, then charged between the ogres, slashing and sticking as he passed. More harmful to the beasts, though, were their own clubs. They turned to swipe at the elf, but could not match his quickness and wound up slamming each other instead. One of the unfortunate ogres caught its companion\u0027s club in the head as it bent low to grab the elf. It spun two full circles before winding down to the ground. Elbereth was back on the other before it could recover from the force of the clubbing and the shock of downing its companion. The elf leaped right up the creature\u0027s chest and drove his sword hard into its neck. The magical blade bent as it slipped into the thick hide, but its steel proved stronger than ogre flesh. The doomed monster did manage to slap Elbereth from it before it died, sending the elf flying into the brush between two wide elms. Elbereth was not badly hurt, but he knew he was in trouble. He looked up to see the tree full of waiting orcs. He scrambled desperately as the first of the monsters dropped on him. Danica met the monstrous charge head-on, though she feared straying too far from Cadderly, still back in the original camp, and Elbereth, all the way over to the other side. She kicked one orc in the throat and took another down with three quick punches to the face. There were too many targets. Danica blocked one orog club between crossed arms and quickly snapped her arms back out wide, tearing the weapon from the monster\u0027s grip. Her foot came straight up, catching the orog under the chin and launching it head-over-heels backward. Another orc rushed in from the side, and Danica, frantically turning, sent her foot flying out to meet it. A club smashed into her back, blasting her breath away. Danica resisted the urge to fall and stubbornly turned to meet this newest orc attacker, but an ogre crashed out of the brush suddenly and locked its huge hand on her head, twisting her neck dangerously to the side. Danica started to counter, but the orc\u0027s club hit her again, then orogs grabbed her arms and pressed against her. She thought her head would burst as the ogre\u0027s great hand clenched and twisted some more. Back near the camp\u0027s center, warm blood dripped over Cadderly\u0027s face and neck. By the time he was able to push his way out from under the dead orog, he was drenched with the gruesome stuff. He scrambled to his feet and loaded another dart. A large group of orogs, orcs, and a single ogre approached from the east; desperate, Cadderly didn\u0027t know who to shoot first, then he saw the ogre\u0027s cargo: Danica, held firmly by the head, with two orogs loosely holding her arms. The ogre eyed Cadderly and gave a quick twist, and Danica\u0027s face contorted in pain. \"Enough!\" roared an orc from behind the lead rank. The creature moved cautiously around its ogre companion. \"Surrender or me ogre breakses the girl\u0027s neck!\" Cadderly wanted to swing his bow around and destroy the arrogant orc, but he couldn\u0027t deny Danica\u0027s predicament. He looked to his love helplessly. He thought of his ring and poisoned dart but dismissed the notion. He didn\u0027t even have his walking stick and doubted that the dosage on the tiny cat\u0027s claw would even affect the large ogre. Then another thought came to him. Danica eyed him curiously, then flashed him a wistful smile, and Cadderly knew she understood. Slowly, Cadderly lowered the crossbow toward the ground. It swung back up suddenly and the young scholar fired the dart into the ogre\u0027s shoulder. The ogre hardly flinched at the explosion, but Cadderly knew he had hurt the creature badly. Danica knew it, too, could tell from the way the monster\u0027s grip suddenly loosened. She dipped free, snapping her arms from her orog captors as she continued to drop. Her crouch brought her right to the ground before she reversed her momentum and leaped straight up. The stunned orogs stared dumbfounded as the powerful monk soared into the air, rising above them. They had only barely begun to react when Danica kicked out to the sides, each foot smashing an orog in the face and sending it flying away. Danica hit the ground and whirled about, punching straight out at her shoulder level, which was the same level as the wounded ogre\u0027s groin. The monster bellowed and went back on its heels, and ferocious Danica pounded it again. \"Stop them!\" the orc to her side screeched. Another explosion sounded and the monster fell silent several feet from where it had been standing. Cadderly wondered if their last ploy had been worth it as he watched Danica batter the ogre\u0027s midsection. Would death be preferable to capture at the hands of such vile monsters? Orogs came at the young scholar slowly, fearing his deadly crossbow. Cadderly knew he was doomed, though he didn\u0027t even realize that Elbereth was no longer fighting and a host of orcs was rushing in from behind. He felt a hot explosion as a club slammed against the back of his neck. His last sensation was the taste of dirt in his mouth.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-in-sylvan-shadows-the-cleric-quintet-2/page-11.html","bookId":2108,"book":{"id":2108,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: In Sylvan Shadows (The Cleric Quintet #2)","description":"Storyline: \"Cadderly must leave his home to combat the evil unleashed by the Chaos Curse.
