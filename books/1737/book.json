{"id":1737,"title":"The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: Andrew was one of Earth\u0027s first house robot domestic servants—smoothly designed and functional. But when Andrew started to develop special talents which exceeded the confines of his allotted positronic pathways, he abandoned his domestic duties in favour of more intellectual pursuits. As time passed, Andrew acquired knowledge, feelings and ambitions way beyond anything ever experienced by any other mechanical men. And he found himself launched on to a career which would bring him fame fortune—and danger. For a robot who wants to be human must also be prepared to die... In the Bicentennial Man, Isaac Asimov returns to his first and most enduring love—robotics. The result is a brilliant book of first-class entertainment and mind-spinning ideas which confirm Asimov\u0027s supreme status as Grand Master of science fiction.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bicentennial-man-and-other-stories.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":12,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
