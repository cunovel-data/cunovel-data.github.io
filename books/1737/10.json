{"id":69807,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Ben Estes knew he was going to die and it didn\u0027t make him feel any better to know that that was the chance he had lived with all these years. The life of an astro-miner, drifting through the still largely uncharted vastness of the asteroid belt, was not particularly sweet, but it was quite likely to be short.\n Of course, there was always the chance of a surprise find.that would make you rich for life, and this had been a surprise find all right. The biggest surprise in the world, but it wasn\u0027t going to make Estes rich. It would make him dead.\n Harvey Funarelli groaned softly from his bunk, and Estes turned, with a wince of his own as his muscles creaked. They had been badly mishandled. That he wasn\u0027t hit as viciously as Funarelli had been was surely because Funarelli was the larger man, and had been closer to the point of near-impact.\n Estes looked somberly at his partner and said, \"How do you feel, Harv?\"\n Funarelli groaned again. \"I feel broken at every joint. What the hell happened? What did we hit?\"\n Estes walked over, limping slightly, and said, \"Don\u0027t try to stand up.\"\n \"I can make it,\" said Funarelli, \"if you\u0027ll just reach out a hand. Wow! I wonder if I\u0027ve got a broken rib. Right here. What happened, Ben?\"\n Estes pointed at the main portview. It wasn\u0027t a large one, but it was the best a two-man astro-mining vessel could be expected to have. Funarelli moved toward it very slowly, leaning on Estes\u0027 shoulder. He looked out.\n There were the stars, of course, but the experienced astronautic mind blanks those out. There are always the stars. Closer in, there was a gravel bank of boulders of varying size, all moving slowly relative to their neighbors like a swarm of very, very lazy bees.\n Funarelli said, \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like that before. What are they doing here?\"\n \"Those rocks,\" said Estes, \"are what\u0027s left of a shattered asteroid, I suspect, and they\u0027re still circling what shattered them, and what shattered us.\"\n \"What?\" Funarelli peered vainly into the darkness.\n Estes pointed. \"That!\" There was a faint little sparkle in the direction he was pointing.\n \"I don\u0027t see anything.\"\n \"You\u0027re not supposed to. That\u0027s a black hole.\" Funarelli\u0027s close-cropped black hair stood on end as a matter of course, and his staring dark eyes added a touch of horror. He said, \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\n \"No. Black holes can come in all sizes. That\u0027s what the astronomers say. That one is about the mass of a large asteroid, I think, and we\u0027re moving around it. How else could something we can\u0027t see be holding us ill orbit?\"\n \"There\u0027s no report on any-\"\n \"I know. How can there be? It can\u0027t be seen. It\u0027s massOoops, there comes the Sun.\" The slowly rotating ship had brought the Sun into view and the portview automatically polarized into opacity. \"Anyway,\" said Estes, \"we discovered the first black hole actually to be encountered anywhere in the Universe. Only we won\u0027t live to see ourselves get the credit.\"\n Funarelli said, \"What happened?\"\n \"We got close enough for the tidal effects to smash us up.\"\n \"What tidal effects?\"\n Estes said, \"I\u0027m not an astronomer, but as I understand it, even when the total gravitational pull of a thing like that isn\u0027t large, you can get so close to it that the pull becomes intense. That intensity falls off so rapidly with increasing distance that the near end of an object is pulled far more strongly than the far end. The object is therefore stretched. The closer and bigger an object is, the worse the effect. Your muscles were torn. You\u0027re lucky your bones weren\u0027t broken.\"\n Funarelli grimaced. \"I\u0027m not sure they aren\u0027t...What else happened?\"\n \"The fuel tanks were destroyed. We\u0027re stuck here in orbit...It\u0027s just lucky we happened to end in one far enough away and circular enough to keep the tidal effect down. If we were closer, or if we even zoomed in closely at one end of the orbit-\"\n \"Can we get word out?\"\n \"Not a word,\" said Estes. \"Communications are smashed.\"\n \"You can\u0027t fix it?\"\n \"I\u0027m not really a communications expert, but even if I were-It can\u0027t be fixed.\"\n \"Can\u0027t something be jury-rigged?\"\n Estes shook his head. \"We\u0027ve just got to wait-and die. That\u0027s not what bothers me so much.\"\n \"It bothers me,\" said Funarelli, sitting down on his bunk and placing his head in his hands.\n \"We\u0027ve got the pills,\" said Estes. \"It would be an easy death. What\u0027s really bad is that we can\u0027t get word back about -that.\" He pointed to the portview, which was clear again as the Sun moved out of range.\n \"About the black hole?\"\n \"Yes, it\u0027s dangerous. It seems to be in orbit about the Sun, but who knows whether that orbit is stable. And even if it is, it\u0027s bound to get larger.\"\n \"I guess it will swallow stuff.\"\n \"Sure. Everything it encounters. There\u0027s cosmic dust spiraling into it all the time, and giving off energy as it spirals and drops in. That\u0027s what makes those dim sparkles of light. Every once in a while, the hole will swallow up a large piece that gets in the way and there\u0027ll be a flash of radiation, right down to X rays. The larger it gets, the easier it is for it to drag in material from a greater and greater distance.\"\n For a moment, both men stared at the portview, then Estes went on. \"Right now it can be handled maybe. If NASA can maneuver a fairly large asteroid here and send it past the hole in the proper way, the hole will be pulled out of its orbit by mutual gravitational attraction between itself and the asteroid. The hole can be made to curve itself into a path that could head it out of the Solar System, with some further help and acceleration.\"\n Funarelli said, \"Do you suppose it started very small?\"\n \"It could have been a micro-hole formed at the time of the big bang, when the Universe was created. It may have been growing for billions of years and if it continues to grow, it may become unmanageable. It will then eventually become the grave of the Solar System.\"\n \"Why haven\u0027t they found it?\"\n \"No one\u0027s been looking. Who would expect a black bole in the asteroid belt? And it doesn\u0027t produce enough radiation to be noticeable, or enough mass to be noticeable. You have to run into it, as we did.\"\n \"Are you sure we have no communications at all, Ben?...How far to Vesta? They could reach us from Vesta without much delay. It\u0027s the largest base in the asteroid belt.\"\n Estes shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know where Vesta is right now. The computer\u0027s knocked out, too.\"\n \"God! What isn\u0027t knocked out?\"\n \"The air system is working. The water purifier is on. We\u0027ve got plenty of power and food. We can last two weeks, maybe more.\"\n A silence fell. \"Look,\" said Funarelli after a while. \"Even if we don\u0027t know where Vesta is exactly, we know it can\u0027t be more than a few million kilometers away. If we could reach them with some signal, they could get a drone ship out here within a week.\"\n \"A drone ship, yes,\" said Estes. That was easy. An unmanned ship could be accelerated to levels that human flesh and blood would not endure. It could make trips in a third the time a manned vessel could.\n Funarelli closed his eyes, as though blocking out the pain, and said, \"Don\u0027t sneer at a drone ship. It could bring us emergency supplies, and it would have stuff on board we could use to set up a communications system. We could hold out till the real rescuers came.\"\n Estes sat down on the other bunk. \"I wasn\u0027t sneering at a drone ship. I was just thinking that there\u0027s no way to send a signal, no way at all. We can\u0027t even yell. The vacuum of space won\u0027t carry sound. \"\n Funarelli said stubbornly, \"I can\u0027t believe you can\u0027t think of something. Our lives depend on it. \"\n \"The lives of all mankind depend on it, maybe, but I still can\u0027t think of anything. Why don\u0027t you think of something?\"\n Funarelli grunted as he moved his hips. He seized the hand grips on the wall next to his bunk and pulled himself up to a standing position. \"I can think of one thing,\" he said, \"why don\u0027t you turn off the gravity motors and save the power and put less strain on our muscles?\"\n Estes muttered, \"Good idea.\" He rose and moved to the control board, where he cut the gravity.\n Funarelli floated upward with a sigh and said, \"Why can\u0027t they find the black hole, the idiots?\"\n \"You mean like we did? There\u0027s no other way. It\u0027s not doing enough.\"\n Funarelli said, \"I still hurt, even with no gravity to fight...Oh well, if it keeps on hurting like this, it won\u0027t matter so much when it comes to pill-taking time...Is there any way we can make that black hole do more than it\u0027s doing?\"\n Estes said grimly, \"If one of those bits of gravel should take it into its head to drop into the hole, a burst of X rays would shoot out.\"\n \"Would they detect that on Vesta?\"\n Estes shook his head. \"I doubt it. They\u0027re not looking for such a thing. They\u0027d be sure to detect it on Earth, though. Some of the space stations keep the sky under constant surveillance for radiation changes. They\u0027d pick up astonishingly small bursts.\"\n \"All right, Ben, reaching Earth would be just as well. They\u0027d send a message to Vesta to investigate. It would take the X rays about fifteen minutes to get to Earth and then it would take fifteen minutes for radio waves to get to Vesta. \"\n \"And how about the time between? The receivers may automatically record a burst of X rays from such and such a direction, but who\u0027s to say where it\u0027s from? It could be from a distant galaxy that happens to lie in this particular direction. Some technician will notice the bump in the recording and will watch for more bursts in the same place and there won\u0027t be any and it will be crossed off as unimportant. Besides, it won\u0027t happen, Harv. There must have been lots of X rays when the black hole broke up this asteroid with its tidal effect, but that may have been thousands of years ago when no one was watching. Now what\u0027s left of these fragments must have fairly stable orbits.\"\n \"If we had our rockets-\"\n \"Let me guess. We could drive our ship into the black hole. Use our deaths to send a message. That wouldn\u0027t do any good either. It would still be one pulse from anywhere.\"\n Funarelli said indignantly, \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of that. I\u0027m not in the market for heroic death. I meant, we\u0027ve got three engines. If we could rig them on to three pretty large size rocks and send each one into the hole, there would be three bursts of X rays and if we did them a day apart, the source would move detectably against the stars. That would be interesting, wouldn\u0027t it? The technicians would pick that up at once, wouldn\u0027t they?\"\n \"Maybe, and maybe not. Besides, we don\u0027t have any rocketry left and couldn\u0027t put them on the rocks if we-\" Estes fell silent. Then he said in an altered voice, \"I wonder if our space suits are intact.\"\n \"Our suit radios,\" said Funarelli excitedly.\n \"Hell, they don\u0027t reach out more than a few kilometers,\" said Estes. \"I\u0027m thinking of something else. I\u0027m thinking of going out there.\" He opened the suit locker. \"They seem all right.\"\n \"Why do you want to go out?\"\n \"We may not have any rockets, but we still have muscle power. At least I have. Do you think you can throw a rock?\"\n Funarelli made a throwing gesture, or the beginning of one, and a look of agony came over his face. \"Can I jump to the Sun?\" he said.\n \"I\u0027ll go out and throw some...The suit seems to check out. Maybe I can throw some into the hole...I hope the air lock operates.\"\n \"Can we spare the air?\" said Funarelli anxiously.\n \"Will it matter in two weeks?\" said Estes wearily.\n Every astro-miner has to get outside the ship occasionally -to carry out some repair, to bring in some chunk of matter in the vicinity. Ordinarily, it\u0027s an exciting time. In any case, it\u0027s a change.\n Estes felt little excitement, only a vast anxiety. His notion was so damned primitive, he felt foolish to have it. It was bad enough dying without having to die a damn fool.\n He found himself in the black of space, with the glittering stars he had seen a hundred times before. Now, though, in the faint reflection of the small and distant Sun, there was the dim glow of hundreds of bits of rock that must once have been part of an asteroid and that now formed a tiny Saturn\u0027s ring about a black hole. The rocks seemed almost motionless, as all drifted along with the ship.\n Estes judged the direction of wheel of the stars and knew that ship and rocks were moving slowly in the other direction. If he could throw a rock in the direction of the star motion, he would neutralize some of the rock\u0027s velocity relative to the black hole. If he neutralized not enough of the velocity, or too much, the rock would drop toward the hole, skim about it, and come back to the point it had left. If he neutralized just enough, it would come close enough to be powdered by the tidal effect. The grains of powder, in their motions, would slow each other and spiral into the hole, releasing X rays as they did so.\n Estes used his miner\u0027s net of tantalum steel to gather rocks, choosing them fist size. He was thankful that modern suits allowed complete freedom of motion and were not the virtual coffins they had been when the first astronauts, over a century ago, had reached the Moon.\n Once he had enough rocks, he threw one, and he could see it glimmer and fade in the sunlight as it dropped toward the hole. He waited and nothing happened. He didn\u0027t know how long it might take to fall into the black hole-if it fell in at all, that is-but he counted six hundred to himself and threw again.\n Over and over he did so, with a terrible patience born of searching for an alternative to death, and finally there was a sudden blaze in the direction of the black hole. Visible light and, he knew, a burst of higher-energy radiation as far as X rays at least.\n He had to stop to gather more rocks, and then he got the range. He was hitting it almost every time. He oriented himself so that the soft glimmer of the black hole would be seen just above the midportion of the ship. That was one relationship that didn\u0027t change as the ship circled and rolled on an axis-or changed least.\n Even allowing for his care, however, it seemed to him he was making too many strikes. The black hole, he thought, was more massive than he knew and would swallow up its prey from a larger distance. That made it more dangerous, but increased their chance of rescue.\n He worked his way through the lock and back into the ship. He was bone-weary and his right shoulder hurt him.\n Funarelli helped him off with the suit. \"That was terrific. You were throwing rocks into the black hole.\"\n Estes nodded. \"Yes, and I\u0027m hoping my suit has been stopping the X rays. I\u0027d just as soon not die of radiation poisoning.\"\n \"They\u0027ll see this back on Earth, won\u0027t they?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they will,\" said Estes, \"but will they pay attention? They\u0027ll record it all and wonder about it. But what\u0027s going to make them come out here for a closer look? I\u0027ve got to work out something that will make them come, after I have just a little time to rest.\"\n An hour later, he lifted out another space suit. No time to wait for the recharge of the solar batteries in the first one. He said, \"I hope I haven\u0027t lost the range.\"\n He was out again, and it had become clear that even allowing a fairly wide spread of velocities and direction, the black hole would suck up the slowing rocks as they moved inward.\n Estes gathered as many rocks as he could manage and placed them carefully on an indentation in the hull of the ship. They didn\u0027t stay there, but they drifted only exceedingly slowly, and even after Estes had collected all he could, those he had placed there first had spread out no more than billiard balls on a pool table.\n Then he threw them, at first tensely, and then with growing confidence, and the black hole flashed-and flashed-and flashed.\n It seemed to him that the target became steadily easier to hit and that the black hole was growing madly with each impact and that soon it would reach out and suck him and the ship into its never-sated maw.\n It was his imagination, of course, and nothing more. Finally all the rocks were gone and he felt he could throw nothing more in any case. He had been out there, it seemed, for hours.\n When he was within the ship again he said, as soon as Funarelli had helped him off with his helmet, \"That\u0027s it. I can\u0027t do anything more.\"\n \"You had plenty of flashes there,\" said Funarelli.\n \"Plenty, and they should surely be recorded. We\u0027ll just have to wait now. They\u0027ve got to come.\"\n Funarelli helped him off with the rest of his suit as best his muscle-torn body would allow. Then he stood, grunting and gasping, and said, \"Do you really think they\u0027ll come, Ben?\"\n \"I think they\u0027ve got to,\" said Estes, almost as though he were trying to force the event by the sheer power of wishing. \"I think they\u0027ve got to.\"\n \"Why do you think they\u0027ve got to?\" said Funarelli, sounding like a man who wanted to grasp at straws but didn\u0027t dare.\n \"Because I communicated,\" said Estes. \"We\u0027re not only the first people to encounter a black hole, we\u0027re the first to use it to communicate; we\u0027re the first to use the ultimate communication system of the future, the one that might send messages from star to star and galaxy to galaxy, and that might be the ultimate energy source as well-\" He was panting, and he sounded a little wild.\n \"What are you talking about?\" said Funarelli.\n \"I threw those rocks in rhythm, Harv,\" said Estes, \"and the X-ray bursts came in rhythm. It was flash-flash-flash-flash-flash-flash-flash-flash-flash, and so on.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"It\u0027s old-fashioned; old-fashioned, but that\u0027s one thing everyone remembers from the days when people communicated by electric currents running through wires.\"\n \"You mean the photograph-phonograph-\"\n \"The telegraph, Harv. Those flashes I produced will be recorded and the first time someone looks at that record, all hell will break loose. It\u0027s not just that they\u0027ll be spotting an X-ray source; it\u0027s not just that it will be an X-ray source moving very slowly against the stars so that it has to be within our Solar System. What it is, is that they\u0027ll be seeing an X-ray source going on and off and producing the signal sos-sos-And when an X-ray Source is shouting for help, you\u0027ll bet they\u0027ll come-as fast as they can-if only to see-what\u0027s-there-that-\"\n He was asleep.\n - And five days later, a drone ship arrived.\n Incidentally, it may occur to some of my Gentle Readers that there is a certain similarity between the story and my very first published story, MAROONED OFF VESTA, which appeared in print thirty-seven years earlier. In each story, two men are trapped on a spaceship wrecked in the asteroid belt and must use their ingenuity to devise a way of escaping what looked like certain death.\n Of course, the resolutions are completely different, and it was in my mind to demonstrate some of the changes in our outlook on the Universe that took place in those thirty-seven years by producing in 1976 a resolution that would have been inconceivable in 1939.\n In the fall of 1975, Fred Dannay (better known as Ellery Queen) approached me with a very intriguing idea for the August 1976 issue of Ellery Queen\u0027s Mystery Magazine, which would be on the stands at the time of the Bicentennial. He planned to publish a mystery dealing with the Bicentennial itself, and another dealing with the Centennial in 1876. What he needed now was one for the Tricentennial in 2076 and, of course, that meant a science fiction story.\n Since I have been writing numerous mystery stories for the magazine in recent years, he thought of me and proposed that I tackle the job. I agreed and got to work on November 1, 1975. I ended with uncompromising science fiction which I feared might make a little heavy going for mystery readers. Fred thought otherwise, apparently, for he took the story and was even kind enough to pay me a bonus. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bicentennial-man-and-other-stories/page-10.html","bookId":1737,"book":{"id":1737,"title":"The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories","description":"Storyline: \n Andrew was one of Earth\u0027s first house robot domestic servants—smoothly designed and functional.
