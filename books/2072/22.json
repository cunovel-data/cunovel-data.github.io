Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think \u0027my fangs\u0027) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said, \u0027Shoo!\u0027 Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore s office.\\n\\n \u0027Fizzing Whizzbee,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.\\n\\n Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.\\n\\n Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside.\\n\\n The room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s you, Professor McGonagall ... and ... ah.\u0027\\n\\n Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt, but seemed wide-awake, his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n \u0027Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a ... well, a nightmare,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. \u0027He says ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t a nightmare,\u0027 said Harry quickly.\\n\\n Professor McGonagall looked round at Harry, frowning slightly.\\n\\n \u0027Very well, then, Potter, you tell the Headmaster about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I ... well, I was asleep ...\u0027 said Harry and, even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand, he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his own interlocked fingers. \u0027But it wasn\u0027t an ordinary dream ... it was real ... I saw it happen ...\u0027 He took a deep breath, \u0027Ron\u0027s dad--Mr. Weasley--has been attacked by a giant snake.\u0027\\n\\n The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.\\n\\n \u0027How did you see this?\u0027 Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Well ... I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Harry, rather angrily--what did it matter? \u0027Inside my head, I suppose--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You misunderstand me,\u0027 said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. \u0027I mean ... can you remember--er--where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?\u0027\\n\\n This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew ...\\n\\n \u0027I was the snake,\u0027 he said. \u0027I saw it all from the snake\u0027s point of view.\u0027\\n\\n Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron who was still whey-faced, asked in a new and sharper voice, \u0027Is Arthur seriously injured?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry emphatically--why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him?\\n\\n But Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry jump, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling. \u0027Everard?\u0027 he said sharply. \u0027And you too, Dilys!\u0027\\n\\n A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.\\n\\n \u0027You were listening?\u0027 said Dumbledore.\\n\\n The wizard nodded; the witch said, \u0027Naturally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The man has red hair and glasses,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people--\u0027\\n\\n Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts) neither reappeared. One frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.\\n\\n \u0027Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwartss most celebrated Heads,\u0027 Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door. \u0027Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Please sit down, all three of you,\u0027 said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken, \u0027Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs.\u0027\\n\\n Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry\u0027s hearing. Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes\u0027s plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.\\n\\n \u0027We will need,\u0027 Dumbledore said very quietly to the bird, \u0027a warning.\u0027\\n\\n There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.\\n\\n Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.\\n\\n The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air ... a serpent\u0027s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.\\n\\n \u0027Naturally, naturally,\u0027 murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. \u0027But in essence divided?\u0027\\n\\n Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished.\\n\\n Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait., panting slightly.\\n\\n \u0027Dumbledore!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What news?\u0027 said Dumbledore at once.\\n\\n \u0027I yelled until someone came running,\u0027 said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, \u0027said I\u0027d heard something moving downstairs--they weren\u0027t sure whether to believe me but went down to check--you know there are no portraits down there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn\u0027t look good, he\u0027s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg\u0027s portrait to get a good view as they left--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement. \u0027I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then--\u0027\\n\\n And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture, too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, \u0027Yes, they\u0027ve taken him to St. Mungo\u0027s, Dumbledore ... they carried him past my portrait ... he looks bad ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Dumbledore. He looked round at Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n \u0027Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course ...\u0027\\n\\n Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door. Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was looking terrified.\\n\\n \u0027And Dumbledore-- what about Molly?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door.\\n\\n \u0027That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027But she may already know ... that excellent clock of hers ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley\u0027s hand must, even now, be pointing at mortal peril.But it was very late. Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. Harry felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley\u0027s boggart turning into Mr. Weasley\u0027s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face ... but Mr. Weasley wasn\u0027t going to die ... he couldn\u0027t ...\\n\\n Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully on his desk. He raised his wand and murmured, \u0027Portus!\u0027 For a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light; then it quivered to rest, as solidly black as ever.\\n\\n Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore\u0027s voice when he attempted to rouse him.\\n\\n \u0027Phineas. Phineas.\u0027\\n\\n The subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too.\\n\\n \u0027Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!\u0027\\n\\n He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide.\\n\\n \u0027Did someone call?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027I\u0027ve got another message.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Visit my other portrait?\u0027 said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn (his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on Harry). \u0027Oh, no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight.\u0027\\n\\n Something about Phineas\u0027s voice was familiar to Harry, where had he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.\\n\\n \u0027Insubordination, sir!\u0027 roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists. \u0027Dereliction of duty!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts!\u0027 cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognised as Dumbledore\u0027s predecessor, Armando Dippet. \u0027Sharne on you, Phineas!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?\u0027 called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, very well,\u0027 said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing the wand with mild apprehension, \u0027though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he\u0027s done away with most of the family--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,\u0027 said Dumbledore, and Harry realised immediately where he had heard Phineas\u0027s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. \u0027You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,\u0027 repeated Phineas in a bored voice. \u0027Yes, yes ... very well ...\u0027\\n\\n He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again. Fred, George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked, still in their night things.\\n\\n \u0027Harry--what\u0027s going on?\u0027 asked Ginny, who looked frightened. \u0027Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,\u0027 said Dumbledore, before Harry could speak. \u0027He has been taken to St. Mungo\u0027s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius\u0027s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than The Burrow. You will meet your mother there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027re we going?\u0027 asked Fred, looking shaken. \u0027Floo powder?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Dumbledore, \u0027Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.\u0027 He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. \u0027We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back ... I want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you--\u0027\\n\\n There was a flash of flame in the very middle of: the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.\\n\\n \u0027It is Fawkes\u0027s warning,\u0027 said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. \u0027Professor Umbridge must know you\u0027re out of your beds ... Minerva, go and head her off--tell her any story--\u0027\\n\\n Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.\\n\\n \u0027He says he\u0027ll be delighted,\u0027 said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. \u0027My great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come here, then,\u0027 Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. \u0027And quickly, before anyone else joins us.\u0027\\n\\n Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore\u0027s desk.\\n\\n \u0027You have all used a Portkey before?\u0027 asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle. \u0027Good. On the count of three, then ... one ... two ...\u0027\\n\\n It happened in a fraction of a second: in the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said \u0027three\u0027, Harry looked up at him--they were very close together--and Dumbledore\u0027s clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry\u0027s face.\\n\\n At once, Harry\u0027s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again--and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, he would like nothing better than to strike--to bite--to sink his fangs into the man before him--\\n\\n \u0027... three.\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onwards ... until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground, and somewhere close at hand a voice said:\\n\\n \u0027Back again, the blood-traitor brats. Is it true their father\u0027s dying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OUT!\u0027 roared a second voice.\\n\\n Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying towards them all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. \u0027Thineas Nigellus said Arthur\u0027s been badly injured--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ask Harry,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,\u0027 said George.\\n\\n The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher\u0027s footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside.\\n\\n \u0027It was--\u0027 Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore. \u0027I had a--a kind of--vision ...\u0027\\n\\n And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake\u0027s own eyes. Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time.\\n\\n \u0027Is Mum here?\u0027 said Fred, turning to Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027She probably doesn\u0027t even know what\u0027s happened yet,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore\u0027s letting Molly know now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to go to St. Mungos,\u0027 said Ginny urgently, She looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pyjamas. \u0027Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hang on, you can\u0027t go tearing off to St. Mungo\u0027s!\u0027 said Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027Course we can go to St. Mungo\u0027s if we want,\u0027 said Fred, with a mulish expression. \u0027He\u0027s our dad!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What does that matter?\u0027 said George hotly.\\n\\n \u0027It matters because we don\u0027t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away!\u0027 said Sirius angrily. \u0027Have you any idea what the Ministry would make off that information?\u0027\\n\\n Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything. Ron was still ashen-faced and silent.\\n\\n Ginny said, \u0027Somebody else could have told us ... we could have heard it somewhere other than Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like who?\u0027 said Sirius impatiently. \u0027Listen, your dad\u0027s been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order\u0027s--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t care about the dumb Order!\u0027 shouted Fred.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s our dad dying we\u0027re talking about!\u0027 yelled George.\\n\\n \u0027Your father knew what he was getting into and he won\u0027t thank you for messing things up for the Order!\u0027 said Sirius, equally angry. \u0027This is how it is--this is why you\u0027re not in the Order--you don\u0027t understand--there are things worth dying for!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Easy for you to say, stuck here!\u0027 bellowed Fred. \u0027I don\u0027t see you risking your neck!\u0027\\n\\n The little colour remaining in Sirius\u0027s face drained from it. He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm.\\n\\n \u0027I know it\u0027s hard, but we\u0027ve all got to act as though we don\u0027t know anything yet. We\u0027ve got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?\u0027\\n\\n Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug, and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats either side of Ginny.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Sirius encouragingly, \u0027come on, lets all ... let\u0027s all have a drink while we\u0027re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!\u0027\\n\\n He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sirius\u0027s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them. They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.\\n\\n Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place.\\n\\n Don\u0027t be stupid, you haven\u0027t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his Butterbeer bottle was shaking, you were lying in bed, you weren\u0027t attacking anyone ...\\n\\n But then, what just happened in Dumbledore\u0027s office? he asked himself. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore, too ...\\n\\n He put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to, and it slopped over on to the table. No one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and, as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather.\\n\\n \u0027Fawkes!\u0027 said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. \u0027That\u0027s not Dumbledore\u0027s writing-- it must be a message from your mother--here--\u0027\\n\\n He thrust the letter into George\u0027s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud: \u0027Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo\u0027s now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.\u0027\\n\\n George looked around the table.\\n\\n \u0027Still alive ...\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027But that makes it sound ...\u0027\\n\\n He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry, too, as though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother\u0027s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment out of George\u0027s hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his Butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.\\n\\n If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one, he could not remember it. Sirius suggested once, without any real conviction, that they all go to bed, but the Weasleys\u0027 looks of disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, occasionally raising a bottle to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure each other that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs. Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo\u0027s.\\n\\n Fred fell into a doze, his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. Harry and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting ... waiting ...\\n\\n At ten past five in the morning by Ron\u0027s watch, the kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron and Harry half rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s going to be all right,\u0027 she said, her voice weak with tiredness. \u0027He\u0027s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill\u0027s sitting with him now; he\u0027s going to take the morning off work.\u0027\\n\\n Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his Butterbeer in one.\\n\\n \u0027Breakfast!\u0027 said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. \u0027Where\u0027s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!\u0027\\n\\n But Kreacher did not answer the summons.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, forget it, then,\u0027 muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him. \u0027So, it\u0027s breakfast for--let\u0027s see--seven ... bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast--\u0027\\n\\n Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude on the Weasleys\u0027 happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what would have happened if it hadn\u0027t been for you, Harry\u0027 she said in a muffled voice. \u0027They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he\u0027s alive and Dumbledore\u0027s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you\u0027ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry could hardly bear her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr. Weasley was in hospital.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Sirius, I\u0027m so grateful ... they think he\u0027ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer ... of course, that might mean we\u0027re here for Christmas.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The more the merrier!\u0027 said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast.\\n\\n \u0027Sirius,\u0027 Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. \u0027Can I have a quick word? Er-- now?\u0027\\n\\n He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble, Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n When he paused for breath, Sirius said, \u0027Did you tell Dumbledore this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry impatiently,\u0027 but he didn\u0027t tell me what it meant. Well, he doesn\u0027t tell me anything any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I \u0027m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,\u0027 said Sirius steadily.\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s not all,\u0027 said Harry, in a voice only a little above a whisper. \u0027Sirius, I ... I think I\u0027m going mad. Back in Dumbledore\u0027s office, just before we took the Portkey ... for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one--my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore--Sirius, I wanted to attack him!\u0027\\n\\n He could only see a sliver of Sirius\u0027s face; the rest was in darkness.\\n\\n \u0027It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t that,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head, \u0027it was like something rose up inside me, like there\u0027s a snake inside me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You need to sleep,\u0027 said Sirius firmly. \u0027You\u0027re going to have breakfast, then go upstairs to bed, and after lunch you can go and see Arthur with the others. You\u0027re in shock, Harry; you\u0027re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it\u0027s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying.\u0027\\n\\n He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark.\\n\\n Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went up to the bedroom he and Ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others ...\\n\\n When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo\u0027s. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts. When Tonks and Mad-Eye turned up to escort them across London, they greeted them gleefully, laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the Underground.\\n\\n Tonks was very interested in Harry\u0027s vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley, something Harry was not remotely interested in discussing.\\n\\n \u0027There isn\u0027t any Seer blood in your family, is there?\u0027 she enquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Tonks musingly, \u0027no, I suppose it\u0027s not really prophecy you\u0027re doing, is it? I mean, you\u0027re not seeing the future, you\u0027re seeing the present ... it\u0027s odd, isn\u0027t it? Useful, though ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t answer; fortunately, they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him. Trying to avoid any more questions about his dream, he asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo\u0027s was hidden.\\n\\n \u0027Not far from here,\u0027 grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. \u0027Wasn\u0027t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn\u0027t have it underground like the Ministry--wouldn\u0027t be healthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was, sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd.\u0027\\n\\n He seized Harry\u0027s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.\\n\\n \u0027Here we go,\u0027 said Moody a moment later.\\n\\n They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red-brick department store called Purge \u0026 Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read: \u0027Closed for Refurbishment\u0027. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, \u0027It\u0027s never open, that place ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Tonks, beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. \u0027Everybody ready?\u0027\\n\\n They nodded, clustering around her. Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. \u0027Wotcher,\u0027 she said, \u0027we\u0027re here to see Arthur Weasley.\u0027\\n\\n Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass, with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dummies couldn\u0027t hear anyway. Next second, his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger, and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished.\\n\\n Fred, George and Ron stepped after them. Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of Purge \u0026 Dowse Ltd; nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them.\\n\\n \u0027C\u0027mon,\u0027 growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back, and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.\\n\\n There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood. They were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady.\\n\\n Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge\u0027s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed.\\n\\n \u0027Are they doctors?\u0027 he asked Ron quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Doctors?\u0027 said Ron, looking startled. \u0027Those Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, they\u0027re Healers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Over here!\u0027 called Mrs. Weasley, above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked Enquiries.The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like: A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTI-DON\u0027TS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER. There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled:\\n\\n Dilys Derwent\\n\\n St. Mungo\u0027s Healer 1722-1741\\n\\n Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\\n\\n 1741-1768\\n\\n Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party closely as though counting them; when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished.\\n\\n Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s these-- ouch--shoes my brother gave me--ow--they re eating my--OUCH--feet--look at them, there must be some kind of--AARGH--jinx on them and I can\u0027t-- AAAAARGH--get them off.\u0027 He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals.\\n\\n \u0027The shoes don\u0027t prevent you reading, do they?\u0027 said the blonde witch, irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. \u0027You want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide. Next!\u0027\\n\\n As the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide:\\n\\n ARTEFACT ACCIDENTS...................................... Ground floor\\n\\n Cauldron explosion, wand backfiring, broom\\n\\n crashes, etc.\\n\\n CREATURE-INDUCED INJURIES........................ First floor\\n\\n Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc.\\n\\n MAGICAL BUGS.................................................... Second floor\\n\\n Contagious maladies, e.g. dragon pox,\\n\\n vanishing sickness, scrofungulus, etc.\\n\\n POTION AND PLANT POISONING...................... Third floor\\n\\n Rashes, regurgitation, uncontrollable\\n\\n giggling, etc.\\n\\n SPELL DAMAGE..................................................... Fourth floor\\n\\n Unliftable jinxes, hexes, incorrectly\\n\\n applied charms, etc.\\n\\n VISITORS\u0027 TEAROOM / HOSPITAL SHOP.......... Fifth floor\\n\\n IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHERE TO GO, INCAPABLE OF NORMAL SPEECH OR UNABLE TO REMEMBER WHY YOU ARE HERE, OUR WELCOMEWITCH WILL BE PLEASED TO HELP.\\n\\n A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now. \u0027I\u0027m here to see Broderick Bode!\u0027 he wheezed.\\n\\n \u0027Ward forty-nine, but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re wasting your time,\u0027 said the witch dismissively. \u0027He\u0027s completely addled, you know--still thinks he\u0027s a teapot. Next!\u0027\\n\\n A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit.\\n\\n \u0027Fourth floor,\u0027 said the witch, in a bored voice, without asking, and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. \u0027Next!\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 she said, \u0027my husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arthur Weasley?\u0027 said the witch, running her finger down a long list in front of her. \u0027Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai Llewellyn Ward.\u0027\\n\\n Thank you,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley. \u0027Come on, you lot.\u0027\\n\\n They followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the Creature-Induced Injuries corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words: \u0027Dangerous\u0027 Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites.Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten: Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck. Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll wait outside, Molly,\u0027 Tonks said. \u0027Arthur won\u0027t want too many visitors at once ... it ought to be just the family first.\u0027\\n\\n Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all directions. Harry drew back, too, but Mrs Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door, saying, \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, Harry, Arthur wants to thank you.\u0027\\n\\n The ward was small and rather dingy, as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-looking wizard on the wall, captioned: Urquhart Rackharrow, 1612-1697, Inventor of the Entrail-expelling Curse.\\n\\n There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed. He looked up as they walked towards him and, seeing who it was, beamed.\\n\\n \u0027Hello!\u0027 he called, throwing the Prophet aside. \u0027Bill just left, Molly, had to get back to work, but he says he\u0027ll drop in on you later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How are you, Arthur?\u0027 asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. \u0027You\u0027re still looking a bit peaky.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I feel absolutely fine,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm to give Ginny a hug. \u0027If they could only take the bandages off, I\u0027d be fit to go home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why can\u0027t they take them off, Dad?\u0027 asked Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all. \u0027It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake\u0027s fangs that keeps wounds open. They\u0027re sure they\u0027ll find an antidote, though; they say they\u0027ve had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,\u0027 he said, dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. \u0027Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A werewolf?\u0027 whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. \u0027Is he safe in a public ward? Shouldn\u0027t he be in a private room?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s two weeks till full moon,\u0027 Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly. \u0027They\u0027ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him he\u0027ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I said to him--didn\u0027t mention names, of course-- but I said I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did he say?\u0027 asked George.\\n\\n \u0027Said he\u0027d give me another bite if I didn\u0027t shut up,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley sadly. \u0027And that woman over there,\u0027 he indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, \u0027won\u0027t tell the Healers what bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg, very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?\u0027 asked Fred, pulling his chair closer to the bed.\\n\\n \u0027Well, you already know, don\u0027t you?\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry. \u0027It\u0027s very simple--I\u0027d had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on and bitten.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?\u0027 asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.\\n\\n \u0027No, of course not,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, \u0027the Ministry wouldn\u0027t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arthur!\u0027 Mrs Weasley warned him.\\n\\n \u0027--got--er-- me,\u0027 Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say.\\n\\n \u0027So where were you when it happened, Dad?\u0027 asked George.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s my business,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile. He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, \u0027I was just reading about Willy Widdershins\u0027s arrest when you arrived. You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When you say you were \"on duty\",\u0027 Fred interrupted in a low voice, \u0027what were you doing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You heard your father,\u0027 whispered Mrs. Weasley, \u0027we are not discussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, don\u0027t ask me how, but he actually got off the toilet charge,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley grimly. \u0027I can only suppose gold changed hands--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were guarding it, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 said George quietly. \u0027The weapon? The thing You-Know-Who\u0027s after?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027George, be quiet!\u0027 snapped Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 said Mr Weasley, in a raised voice, \u0027this time Willy\u0027s been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be able to worm his way out of it because, according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo\u0027s for emergency bone re-growth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in St. Mungo\u0027s! I wonder which ward they\u0027re in?\u0027\\n\\n And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t you say You-Know-Who\u0027s got a snake, Harry?\u0027 asked Fred, looking at his father for a reaction. \u0027A massive one? You saw it the night he returned, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley crossly. \u0027Mad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can wait outside,\u0027 she added to her children and Harry. \u0027You can come and say goodbye afterwards. Go on.\u0027\\n\\n They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, \u0027be like that. Don\u0027t tell us anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Looking for these?\u0027 said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-coloured string.\\n\\n \u0027You read my mind,\u0027 said Fred, grinning. \u0027Let\u0027s see if St. Mungo\u0027s puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?\u0027\\n\\n He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around. Harry hesitated to take one.\\n\\n \u0027Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad\u0027s life. If anyone\u0027s got the right to eavesdrop on him, it\u0027s you.\u0027\\n\\n Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.\\n\\n \u0027OK, go!\u0027 Fred whispered.\\n\\n The flesh-coloured strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door. At first, Harry could hear nothing, then he jumped as he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him.\\n\\n \u0027... they searched the whole area but couldn\u0027t find the snake anywhere. It just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur ... but You-Know-Who can\u0027t have expected a snake to get in, can he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I reckon he sent it as a lookout,\u0027 growled Moody, \u0027 \u0027cause he\u0027s not had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he\u0027s trying to get a clearer picture of what he\u0027s facing and if Arthur hadn\u0027t been there the beast would\u0027ve had a lot more time to look around. So, Potter says he saw it all happen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mrs Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. \u0027You know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well,\u0027 said Moody, \u0027there\u0027s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning,\u0027 whispered Mrs Weasley.\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027Course he\u0027s worried,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027The boy\u0027s seeing things from inside You-Know-Who\u0027s snake. Obviously, Potter doesn\u0027t realise what that means, but if You-Know-Who\u0027s possessing him--\u0027\\n\\n Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their ears, looking suddenly fearful. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-22.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
