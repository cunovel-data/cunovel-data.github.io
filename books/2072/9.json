{"id":111676,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Dumbledore\u0027s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention, except the toadlike witch on Fudge\u0027s right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge\u0027s eye, or Madam Bones\u0027s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and, when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.\\n\\n He took the last lew steps at a run, wrenched open the door and almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive.\\n\\n \u0027Dumbledore didn\u0027t say--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cleared,\u0027 Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, \u0027of all charges!\u0027\\n\\n Beaming, Mr Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Harry, that\u0027s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn\u0027t have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can\u0027t pretend I wasn\u0027t--\u0027\\n\\n But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had ust opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.\\n\\n \u0027Merlin\u0027s beard!\u0027 exclaimed Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass. \u0027You were tried by the full court?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think so,\u0027 said Harry quietly.\\n\\n One or two of the wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, \u0027Morning, Arthur,\u0027 to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley\u0027s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,\u0027 he said, beckoning Harry forwards as Percy\u0027s heels disappeared up the steps to Level Nine. \u0027I\u0027ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on....\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, what will you have to do about the toilet?\u0027 Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s a simple enough anti-jinx,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley as they mounted the stairs, \u0027but it\u0027s not so much having to repair the damage, it\u0027s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it\u0027s an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one--\u0027\\n\\n Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninth-level corridor and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale face.\\n\\n The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He, too, broke off in mid-conversation, his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well, well ... Patronus Potter,\u0027 said Lucius Malfoy coolly.\\n\\n Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something solid. He had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a Death Eater\u0027s hood, and last heard that man\u0027s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. Harry could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.\\n\\n \u0027The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,\u0027 drawled Mr. Malfoy. \u0027Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes.... Snakelike, in fact...\u0027\\n\\n Mr. Weasley gripped Harry\u0027s shoulder in warning.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027yeah, I\u0027m good at escaping.\u0027\\n\\n Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I work here,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley curtly.\\n\\n \u0027Not here, surely?\u0027 said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over Mr. Weasley\u0027s shoulder. \u0027I thought you were up on the second floor.... Don\u0027t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artefacts home and bewitching them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Mr. Weasley snapped, his fingers now biting into Harry\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027What areyou doing here, anyway?\u0027 Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,\u0027 said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes. Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold. \u0027Really, just because you are Dumbledore\u0027s favourite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us.... Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. Weasley. \u0027This way, Lucius.\u0027\\n\\n They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not let go of Harry\u0027s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.\\n\\n \u0027Why wasn\u0027t he waiting outside Fudge\u0027s office if they\u0027ve got business to do together?\u0027 Harry burst out furiously. \u0027What was he doing down here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard. \u0027Trying to find out whether you\u0027d been expelled or not. I\u0027ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy\u0027s been talking to Fudge again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What private business have they got together, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gold, I expect,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley angrily. \u0027Malfoy\u0027s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years.... Gets him in with the right people ... then he can ask favours ... delay laws he doesn\u0027t want passed... Oh, he\u0027s very well-connected, Lucius Malfoy....\u0027\\n\\n The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr. Weasley\u0027s head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut. He waved them away irritably.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Weasley,\u0027 said Harry slowly, \u0027if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he\u0027s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven\u0027t put the Imperius Curse on him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t think it hadn\u0027t occurred to us, Harry,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley quietly. \u0027But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment--which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort.... Best not talk about it any more just now, Harry....\u0027\\n\\n The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.\\n\\n \u0027Wait....\u0027 he told Mr. Weasley, and, pulling his moneybag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.\\n\\n He looked up into the handsome wizard\u0027s face, but up close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf\u0027s attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his moneybag upside-down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues\u0027 feet.\\n\\n \u0027I knew it!\u0027 yelled Ron, punching the air. \u0027You always get away with stuff!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They were bound to clear you,\u0027 said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes, \u0027there was no case against you, none at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering you all knew I\u0027d get off,\u0027 said Harry, smiling.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went: \u0027He got off, he got off, he got off--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough! Settle down!\u0027 shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was smiling. \u0027Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Sirius sharply.\\n\\n \u0027He got off, he got off, he got off--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on Level Nine, then they went up to Fudge\u0027s office together. Dumbledore ought to know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027We\u0027ll tell him, don\u0027t worry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027d better get going, there\u0027s a vomiting toilet waiting for me in Bethnal Green. Molly, I\u0027ll be late, I\u0027m covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He got off, he got off, he got off--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough--Fred--George--Ginny!\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley, as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. \u0027Harry, dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast....\u0027\\n\\n Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him, looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at Grimmauld Place, and Harry\u0027s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,\u0027 said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyone\u0027s plates.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, he swung it for me,\u0027 said Harry. He felt it would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, \u0027I wish he\u0027d talked to me, though. Or even looked at me.\u0027\\n\\n And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it..\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 said Hermione, looking alarmed.\\n\\n \u0027Scar,\u0027 Harry mumbled. \u0027But it\u0027s nothing.... It happens all the time now....\u0027\\n\\n None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry\u0027s narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron had said happily, \u0027I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening, to celebrate with us, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be able to, Ron,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. \u0027He\u0027s really very busy at the moment.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF. HE GOT OFF--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027SHUT UP!\u0027 roared Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry\u0027s hand and beaming just like the rest of them. Soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother\u0027s room with Buckbeak.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you go feeling guilty!\u0027 said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. \u0027You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he\u0027s being selfish.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a bit harsh, Hermione,\u0027 said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger, \u0027you wouldn\u0027t want to be stuck inside this house without any company.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll have company!\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027It\u0027s Headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn\u0027t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true,\u0027 said Harry, wringing out his cloth. \u0027He wouldn\u0027t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He just didn\u0027t want to get his own hopes up even more,\u0027 said Hermione wisely. \u0027And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you\u0027d be expelled. Then you\u0027d both be outcasts together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come off it!\u0027 said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron\u0027s mum\u0027s right and Sirius gets confused about whether you\u0027re you or your father, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you think he\u0027s touched in the head?\u0027 said Harry heatedly.\\n\\n \u0027No, I just think he\u0027s been very lonely for a long time,\u0027 said Hermione simply.\\n\\n At this point, Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.\\n\\n \u0027Still not finished?\u0027 she said, poking her head into the cupboard.\\n\\n \u0027I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!\u0027 said Ron bitterly. \u0027D\u0027you know how much mould we\u0027ve got rid of since we arrived here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were so keen to help the Order,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley, \u0027you can do your bit by making Headquarters fit to live in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I feel like a house-elf,\u0027 grumbled Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Well, now you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you\u0027ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!\u0027 said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs. Weasley left them to it. \u0027You know, maybe it wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time--we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,\u0027 Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him.\\n\\n Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses; it would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.\\n\\n The fact was that living at the Headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he\u0027d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.\\n\\n On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig\u0027s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\\n\\n \u0027Booklists have arrived,\u0027 he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. \u0027About time, I thought they\u0027d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this....\u0027\\n\\n Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron\u0027s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter. It contained two pieces of parchment: one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September; the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.\\n\\n \u0027Only two new ones,\u0027 he said, reading the list, \u0027The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk, and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.\u0027\\n\\n Crack.\\n\\n Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn\u0027t even fall off his chair.\\n\\n \u0027We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,\u0027 said Fred conversationally.\\n\\n \u0027Because it means Dumbledore\u0027s found a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,\u0027 said George.\\n\\n \u0027And about time too,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 Harry asked, jumping down beside them.\\n\\n Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,\u0027 Fred told Harry, \u0027and from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not surprising, is it, when you look at what\u0027s happened to the last four?\u0027 said George.\\n\\n \u0027One sacked, one dead, one\u0027s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,\u0027 said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. \u0027Yeah, I see what you mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up with you, Ron?\u0027 asked Fred.\\n\\n Ron did not answer. Harry looked round. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.\\n\\n Fred\u0027s mouth fell open, too.\\n\\n \u0027Prefect?\u0027 he said, staring incredulously at the letter. \u0027Prefect?\u0027\\n\\n George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron\u0027s other hand and turned it upside-down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George\u0027s palm.\\n\\n \u0027No way,\u0027 said George in a hushed voice.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s been a mistake,\u0027 said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron\u0027s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark. \u0027No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect.\u0027\\n\\n The twins\u0027 heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027We thought you were a cert!\u0027 said Fred, in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.\\n\\n \u0027We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!\u0027 said George indignantly.\\n\\n \u0027Winning the Triwizard and everything!\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose all the mad stuff must\u0027ve counted against him,\u0027 said George to Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Fred slowly. \u0027Yeah, you\u0027ve caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you\u0027s got their priorities right.\u0027\\n\\n He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look.\\n\\n \u0027Prefect ... ickle Ronnie the prefect...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Mum\u0027s going to be revolting,\u0027 groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.\\n\\n Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large \u0027P\u0027 was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy\u0027s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.\\n\\n The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.\\n\\n \u0027Did you--did you get--?\u0027\\n\\n She spotted the badge in Harry\u0027s hand and let out a shriek.\\n\\n \u0027I knew it!\u0027 she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. \u0027Me too, Harry, me too!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron\u0027s hand. \u0027It\u0027s Ron, not me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It--what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ron\u0027s prefect, not me,\u0027 Harry said.\\n\\n \u0027Ron?\u0027 said Hermione, her jaw dropping. \u0027But ... are you sure? I mean--\u0027\\n\\n She turned red as Ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s my name on the letter,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I....\u0027 said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. \u0027I ... well ... wow! Well done, Ron! That\u0027s really--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Unexpected,\u0027 said George, nodding.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, \u0027no it\u0027s not ... Ron\u0027s done loads of ... he\u0027s really...\u0027\\n\\n The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.\\n\\n \u0027Ginny said the booklists had come at last,\u0027 she said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles. \u0027If you give them to me I\u0027ll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you\u0027re packing. Ron, I\u0027ll have to get you more pyjamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can\u0027t believe how fast you\u0027re growing ... what colour would you like?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get him red and gold to match his badge,\u0027 said George, smirking.\\n\\n \u0027Match his what?\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on Ron\u0027s pile.\\n\\n \u0027His badge,\u0027 said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly. \u0027His lovely shiny new prefect\u0027s badge.\u0027\\n\\n Fred\u0027s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley\u0027s preoccupation with pyjamas.\\n\\n \u0027His ... but ... Ron, you\u0027re not...?\u0027\\n\\n Ron held up his badge.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe it! I don\u0027t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That\u0027s everyone in the family!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?\u0027 said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.\\n\\n \u0027Wait until your father hears! Ron, I\u0027m so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it\u0027s the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I\u0027m just thrilled, oh, Ronnie--\u0027\\n\\n Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron\u0027s neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge.\\n\\n \u0027Mum ... don\u0027t ... Mum, get a grip....\u0027 he muttered, trying to push her away.\\n\\n She let go of him and said breathlessly, \u0027Well, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you\u0027ve already got one, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027W-what do you mean?\u0027 said Ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got to have a reward for this!\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley fondly. \u0027How about a nice new set of dress robes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve already bought him some,\u0027 said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity.\\n\\n \u0027Or a new cauldron, Charlie\u0027s old one\u0027s rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mum,\u0027 said Ron hopefully, \u0027can I have a new broom?\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley\u0027s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.\\n\\n \u0027Not a really good one!\u0027 Ron hastened to add. \u0027Just--just a new one for a change...\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.\\n\\n \u0027Of course you can.... Well, I\u0027d better get going if I\u0027ve got a broom to buy too. I\u0027ll see you all later.... Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don\u0027t forget to pack your trunks.... A prefect... Oh, I\u0027m all of a dither!\u0027\\n\\n She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room.\\n\\n Fred and George exchanged looks.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t mind if we don\u0027t kiss you, do you, Ron?\u0027 said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.\\n\\n \u0027We could curtsey, if you like,\u0027 said George.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, shut up,\u0027 said Ron, scowling at them.\\n\\n \u0027Or what?\u0027 said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. \u0027Going to put us in detention?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d love to see him try,\u0027 sniggered George.\\n\\n \u0027He could if you don\u0027t watch out!\u0027 said Hermione angrily.\\n\\n Fred and George burst out laughing, and Ron muttered, \u0027Drop it, Hermione.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to have to watch our step, George,\u0027 said Fred, pretending to tremble, \u0027with these two on our case....\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,\u0027 said George, shaking his head.\\n\\n And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.\\n\\n \u0027Those two!\u0027 said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs. \u0027Don\u0027t pay any attention to them, Ron, they\u0027re only jealous!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think they are,\u0027 said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. They\u0027ve always said only prats become prefects.... Still,\u0027 he added on a happier note, \u0027they\u0027ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose.... She\u0027ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there\u0027s the new Cleansweep out, that\u0027d be great.... Yeah, I think I\u0027ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows....\u0027\\n\\n He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.\\n\\n For some reason, Harry found he did not want to look at Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk.\\n\\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 said Hermione tentatively.\\n\\n \u0027Well done, Hermione,\u0027 said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, \u0027brilliant. Prefect. Great.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Erm--Harry--could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They\u0027ll be really pleased--I mean prefect is something they can understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, no problem,\u0027 said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. \u0027Take her!\u0027\\n\\n He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.\\n\\n He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone. Harry hurried across the room, closed the door, then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.\\n\\n He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people. But if he had remembered ... if he had thought about it ... what would he have expected?\\n\\n Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.\\n\\n Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?\\n\\n No, said the small voice defiantly.\\n\\n Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.\\n\\n I\u0027m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I\u0027m not better at anything else.\\n\\n That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?\\n\\n Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harry\u0027s head.\\n\\n Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn\u0027t fight Quirrell with me. They didn\u0027t take on Riddle and the Basilisk. They didn\u0027t get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren\u0027t in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned....\\n\\n And the same feeling of ill-usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again. I\u0027ve definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I\u0027ve done more than either of them!\\n\\n But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn\u0027t choose prefects because they\u0027ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations.... Maybe he chooses them for other reasons.... Ron must have something you don\u0027t....\\n\\n Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe\u0027s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.\\n\\n \u0027No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect....\u0027\\n\\n Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with himself.\\n\\n Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was not Ron\u0027s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron\u0027s best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn\u0027t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron\u0027s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something?\\n\\n At this point Harry heard Ron\u0027s footsteps on the stairs again. He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin on to his face as Ron bounded back through the door.\\n\\n \u0027Just caught her!\u0027 he said happily. \u0027She says she\u0027ll get the Cleansweep if she can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cool,\u0027 Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty. \u0027Listen--Ron--well done, mate.\u0027\\n\\n The smile faded off Ron\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027I never thought it would be me!\u0027 he said, shaking his head. \u0027I thought it would be you!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nah, I\u0027ve caused too much trouble,\u0027 Harry said, echoing Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027yeah, I suppose.... Well, we\u0027d better get our trunks packed, hadn\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect\u0027s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o\u0027clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.\\n\\n \u0027Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,\u0027 she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.\\n\\n Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE--NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday.\\n\\n \u0027I thought we\u0027d have a little party not a sit-down dinner,\u0027 she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room. \u0027Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron. I\u0027ve sent them both owls and they\u0027re thrilled,\u0027 she added, beaming.\\n\\n Fred rolled his eyes.\\n\\n Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Alastor, I am glad you\u0027re here,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his travelling cloak. \u0027We\u0027ve been wanting to ask you for ages--could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what\u0027s inside it? We haven\u0027t wanted to open it just in case it\u0027s something really nasty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No problem, Molly...\u0027\\n\\n Moody\u0027s electric-blue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen.\\n\\n \u0027Drawing room...\u0027 he growled, as the pupil contracted. \u0027Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it.... Yeah, it\u0027s a boggart.... Want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, I\u0027ll do it myself later,\u0027 beamed Mrs. Weasley, \u0027you have your drink. We\u0027re having a little bit of a celebration, actually....\u0027 She gestured at the scarlet banner. \u0027Fourth prefect in the family!\u0027 she said fondly, ruffling Ron\u0027s hair.\\n\\n \u0027Prefect, eh?\u0027 growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin.\\n\\n \u0027Well, congratulations,\u0027 said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, \u0027authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn\u0027t have appointed you....\u0027\\n\\n Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody\u0027s travelling cloak.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think a toast is in order,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a drink. He raised his goblet. \u0027To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!\u0027\\n\\n Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them, and then applauded.\\n\\n \u0027I was never a prefect myself,\u0027 said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food. Her hair was tomato red and waist-length today; she looked like Ginny\u0027s older sister. \u0027My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like what?\u0027 said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.\\n\\n \u0027Like the ability to behave myself,\u0027 said Tonks.\\n\\n Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of Butterbeer and choking on it.\\n\\n \u0027What about you, Sirius?\u0027 Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.\\n\\n Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual bark-like laugh.\\n\\n \u0027No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think Dumbledore might have hoped I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room.\\n\\n Ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen.\\n\\n \u0027...nought to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the Comet Two Ninety\u0027s only nought to sixty and that\u0027s with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?\u0027\\n\\n Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf rights.\\n\\n \u0027I mean, it\u0027s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn\u0027t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they\u0027re superior to other creatures....\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill\u0027s hair.\\n\\n \u0027...getting really out of hand, and you\u0027re so good-looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn\u0027t it, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh--I dunno--\u0027 said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.\\n\\n Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 he told Mundungus, \u0027we can trust Harry, he\u0027s our financial backer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look what Dung\u0027s got us,\u0027 said George, holding out his hand to Harry. It was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods. A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.\\n\\n \u0027Venomous Tentacula seeds,\u0027 said George. \u0027We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they\u0027re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so we\u0027ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Wiv all the trouble I went to to get \u0027em?\u0027 said Mundungus, his saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, lads, but I\u0027m not taking a Knut under twenty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dung likes his little joke,\u0027 Fred said to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of Knarl quills,\u0027 said George.\\n\\n \u0027Be careful,\u0027 Harry warned them quietly.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Fred. \u0027Mum\u0027s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we\u0027re okay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Moody could have his eye on you,\u0027 Harry pointed out.\\n\\n Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Good point, that,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027All right, lads, ten it is, if you\u0027ll take \u0027em quick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cheers, Harry!\u0027 said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins\u0027 outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food. \u0027We\u0027d better get these upstairs....\u0027\\n\\n Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?\\n\\n Standing where the twins had left him, with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt\u0027s deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.\\n\\n \u0027...why Dumbledore didn\u0027t make Potter a prefect?\u0027 said Kingsley.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll have had his reasons,\u0027 replied Lupin.\\n\\n \u0027But it would\u0027ve shown confidence in him. It\u0027s what I\u0027d\u0027ve done,\u0027 persisted Kingsley, \u0027 \u0027specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him every few days....\u0027\\n\\n Harry did not look round; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he had heard. Though not remotely hungry, he followed Mundungus back towards the table. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.\\n\\n Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.\\n\\n \u0027...the handle\u0027s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control--\u0027 Ron was saying to Tonks.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think I\u0027ll sort out that boggart before I turn in.... Arthur, I don\u0027t want this lot up too late, all right? \u0027Night, Harry, dear.\u0027\\n\\n She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention.\\n\\n \u0027You all right, Potter?\u0027 grunted Moody.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, fine,\u0027 lied Harry.\\n\\n Moody took a swig from his hipflask, his electric-blue eye staring sideways at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Come here, I\u0027ve got something that might interest you,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph.\\n\\n \u0027Original Order of the Phoenix,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn\u0027t had the manners to return my best one.... Thought people might like to see it.\u0027\\n\\n Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s me,\u0027 said Moody, unnecessarily pointing at himself. The Moody in the picture was unmistakeable, though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact. \u0027And there\u0027s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side... That\u0027s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. That\u0027s Frank and Alice Longbottom--\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.\\n\\n \u0027Poor devils,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027Better dead than what happened to them ... and that\u0027s Emmeline Vance, you\u0027ve met her, and that there\u0027s Lupin, obviously ... Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him ... shift aside there,\u0027 he added, poking the picture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family, too, he was a great wizard ... Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young ... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body ... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever ... Elphias Doge, you\u0027ve met him, I\u0027d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat ... Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes ... budge along, budge along ...\u0027\\n\\n The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Dumbledore\u0027s brother Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke ... That\u0027s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally ... Sirius, when he still had short hair ... and ... there you go, thought that would interest you!\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man whom Harry recognised at once as Wormtail, the one who had betrayed his parents\u0027 whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths.\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Moody.\\n\\n Harry looked up into Moody s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, once again attempting to grin. \u0027Er ... listen, I\u0027ve just remembered, I haven\u0027t packed my...\u0027\\n\\n He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed. Sirius had just said, \u0027What\u0027s that you\u0027ve got there, Mad-Eye?\u0027 and Moody had turned towards him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.\\n\\n He did not know why it had been such a shock; he had seen pictures of his parents before, after all, and he had met Wormtail ... but to have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it.... No one would like that, he thought angrily...\\n\\n And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces ... Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness ... all waving happily out of the photograph forever more, not knowing that they were doomed ... well, Moody might find that interesting ... he, Harry, found it disturbing....\\n\\n Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf-heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 Harry said.\\n\\n There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing and opened the drawing-room door.\\n\\n Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.\\n\\n All the air seemed to vanish from Harry\u0027s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold--Ron dead, no, it couldn\u0027t be--\u0027\\n\\n But wait a moment, it couldn\u0027t be-- Ron was downstairs--\\n\\n \u0027Mrs. Weasley?\u0027 Harry croaked.\\n\\n \u0027R-r-riddikulus!\u0027 Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand at Ron\u0027s body.\\n\\n Crack\\n\\n Ron\u0027s body turned into Bill\u0027s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide open and empty. Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever.\\n\\n \u0027R-riddikulus!\u0027 she sobbed again.\\n\\n Crack.\\n\\n Mr. Weasley\u0027s body replaced Bill\u0027s, his glasses askew, a trickle of blood running down his face.\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 Mrs. Weasley moaned. \u0027No ... riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS!\u0027\\n\\n Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry...\\n\\n \u0027Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!\u0027 shouted Harry, staring down at his own dead body on the floor. \u0027Let someone else--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027\\n\\n Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling out his own wand, he said, very firmly and clearly, \u0027Riddikulus!\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.\\n\\n \u0027Oh--oh--oh!\u0027 gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands.\\n\\n \u0027Molly,\u0027 said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her. \u0027Molly, don\u0027t...\u0027\\n\\n Next second, she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Molly it was just a boggart,\u0027 he said soothingly, patting her on the head. \u0027Just a stupid boggart...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see them d-d-dead all the time!\u0027 Mrs. Weasley moaned into his shoulder. \u0027All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it...\u0027\\n\\n Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pretending to be Harry\u0027s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody\u0027s magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.\\n\\n \u0027D-d-don\u0027t tell Arthur,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. \u0027I d-d-don\u0027t want him to know.... Being silly...\u0027\\n\\n Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.\\n\\n \u0027Harry, I\u0027m so sorry. What must you think of me?\u0027 she said shakily. \u0027Not even able to get rid of a boggart...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid,\u0027 said Harry, trying to smile.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m just s-s-so worried,\u0027 she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again. \u0027Half the f-f-family\u0027s in the Order, it\u0027ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come through this.... and P-P-Percy\u0027s not talking to us.... What if something d-d-dreadful happens and we\u0027ve never m-m-made it up with him? And what\u0027s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who\u0027s g-g-going to look after Ron and Ginny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Molly, that\u0027s enough,\u0027 said Lupin firmly. \u0027This isn\u0027t like last time. The Order are better prepared, we\u0027ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort\u0027s up to--\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Molly, come on, it\u0027s about time you got used to hearing his name--look, I can\u0027t promise no one\u0027s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we\u0027re much better off than we were last time. You weren\u0027t in the Order then, you don\u0027t understand. Last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one....\u0027\\n\\n Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents\u0027 beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about Percy,\u0027 said Sirius abruptly. \u0027He\u0027ll come round. It\u0027s only a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry\u0027s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll be accepting their apology,\u0027 he added bitterly.\\n\\n \u0027And as for who\u0027s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,\u0027 said Lupin, smiling slightly, \u0027what do you think we\u0027d do, let them starve?\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.\\n\\n \u0027Being silly,\u0027 she muttered again, mopping her eyes.\\n\\n But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley\u0027s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.\\n\\n Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.\\n\\n \u0027Cut it out,\u0027 he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded.\\n\\n \u0027First sign of madness, talking to your own head,\u0027 said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall.\\n\\n Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefect\u0027s badge. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-9.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
