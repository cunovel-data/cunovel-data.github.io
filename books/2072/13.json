{"id":111680,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts\u0027 standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him. On the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story first-hand.\n \u0027He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered ...\u0027\n \u0027He reckons he duelled with You-Know-Who ...\u0027\n \u0027Come off it ...\u0027\n \u0027Who does he think he\u0027s kidding?\u0027\n \u0027Pur-lease ...\u0027\n \u0027What I don\u0027t get,\u0027 said Harry through clenched teeth, laying down his knife and fork (his hands were shaking too much to hold them steady), \u0027is why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them ...\u0027\n \u0027The thing is, Harry, I\u0027m not sure they did,\u0027 said Hermione grimly. \u0027Oh, let\u0027s get out of here.\u0027\n She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked longingly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of the Hall.\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean, you\u0027re not sure they believed Dumbledore?\u0027 Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.\n \u0027Look, you don\u0027t understand what it was like after it happened,\u0027 said Hermione quietly. \u0027You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric\u0027s dead body ... none of us saw what what happened in the maze ... we just had Dumbledore\u0027s word for it that You-Know-Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.\u0027\n \u0027Which is the truth!\u0027 said Harry loudly.\n \u0027I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?\u0027 said Hermione wearily. \u0027It\u0027s just that before the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about how you\u0027re a nutcase and Dumbledore\u0027s going senile!\u0027\n Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady\u0027s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid\u0027s cabin.\n \u0027Mimbulus mimbletonia,\u0027 said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind it and the three of them scrambled through it.\n The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron and Hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to Hermione\u0027s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.\n \u0027How can Dumbledore have let this happen?\u0027 Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. \u0027How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our OWL year, too!\u0027\n \u0027Well, we\u0027ve never had great Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You know what it\u0027s like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job; they say it\u0027s jinxed.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but to employ someone who\u0027s actually refusing to let us do magic! What\u0027s Dumbledore playing at?\u0027\n \u0027And she\u0027s trying to get people to spy for her,\u0027 said Ron darkly.\n \u0027Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Who\u0027s back?\u0027\n \u0027Of course she\u0027s here to spy on us all, that\u0027s obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her to come?\u0027 snapped Hermione.\n \u0027Don\u0027t start arguing again,\u0027 said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate. \u0027Can\u0027t we just... let\u0027s just do that homework, get it out of the way...\u0027\n They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares he was attracting.\n \u0027Shall we do Snape\u0027s stuff first?\u0027 said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink. \u0027\"The properties... of moonstone... and its uses ... in potion-making...\"\u0027 he muttered, writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them. \u0027There.\u0027 He underlined the title, then looked up expectantly at Hermione.\n \u0027So, what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?\u0027\n But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the centre of a knot of innocent-looking first-years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.\n \u0027No, I\u0027m sorry, they\u0027ve gone too far,\u0027 she said, standing up and looking positively furious. \u0027Come on, Ron.\u0027\n \u0027I --what?\u0027 said Ron, plainly playing for time. \u0027No--come on, Hermione--we can\u0027t tell them off for giving out sweets.\u0027\n \u0027You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or--or Puking Pastilles or--\u0027\n \u0027Fainting Fancies?\u0027 Harry suggested quietly.\n One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, \u0027She\u0027s got it under control,\u0027 before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.\n \u0027That\u0027s enough!\u0027 Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of whom looked up in mild surprise.\n \u0027Yeah, you\u0027re right,\u0027 said George, nodding, \u0027this dosage looks strong enough, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027I told you this morning, you can\u0027t test your rubbish on students!\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re paying them!\u0027 said Fred indignantly.\n \u0027I don\u0027t care, it could be dangerous!\u0027\n \u0027Rubbish,\u0027 said Fred.\n \u0027Calm down, Hermione, they\u0027re fine!\u0027 said Lee reassuringly as he walked from first-year to first-year, inserting purple sweets into their open mouths.\n \u0027Yeah, look, they\u0027re coming round now,\u0027 said George.\n A few of the first-years were indeed stirring. Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do.\n \u0027Feel all right?\u0027 said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at his feet.\n \u0027I--I think so,\u0027 she said shakily.\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands.\n \u0027It is NOT excellent!\u0027\n \u0027Course it is, they\u0027re alive, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 said Fred angrily.\n \u0027You can\u0027t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not going to make them ill, we\u0027ve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same--\u0027\n \u0027If you don\u0027t stop doing it, I\u0027m going to--\u0027\n \u0027Put us in detention?\u0027 said Fred, in an I\u0027d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.\n \u0027Make us write lines?\u0027 said George, smirking.\n Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, her voice quivering with anger, \u0027but I will write to your mother.\u0027\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.\n \u0027Oh, yes, I would,\u0027 said Hermione grimly. \u0027I can\u0027t stop you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you\u0027re not to give them to the first-years,\u0027\n Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as they were concerned, Hermione\u0027s threat was way below the belt. With a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred\u0027s clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms, and stalked back to her chair by the fire.\n Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees.\n \u0027Thank you for your support, Ron,\u0027 Hermione said acidly.\n \u0027You handled it fine by yourself,\u0027 Ron mumbled.\n Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s no good, I can\u0027t concentrate now. I\u0027m going to bed.\u0027\n She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect.\n \u0027What in the name of Merlin are you doing?\u0027 said Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity.\n \u0027They\u0027re hats for house-elves,\u0027 she said briskly now stuffing her books back into her bag. \u0027I did them over the summer. I\u0027m a really slow knitter without magic but now I\u0027m back at school I should be able to make lots more.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re leaving out hats for the house-elves?\u0027 said Ron slowly. \u0027And you\u0027re covering them up with rubbish first?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag on to her back.\n That\u0027s not on,\u0027 said Ron angrily. \u0027You\u0027re trying to trick them into picking up the hats. You\u0027re setting them free when they might not want to be free.\u0027\n \u0027Of course they want to be free!\u0027 said Hermione at once, though her face was turning pink. \u0027Don\u0027t you dare touch those hats, Ron!\u0027\n She turned on her heel and left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls\u0027 dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.\n \u0027They should at least see what they\u0027re picking up,\u0027 he said firmly. \u0027Anyway ...\u0027 he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape\u0027s essay, \u0027there\u0027s no point trying to finish this now, I can\u0027t do it without Hermione, I haven\u0027t got a clue what you\u0027re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?\u0027\n Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that when the morning came, he would regret not finishing his homework that night, he piled his books back into his bag.\n \u0027I\u0027m going to bed too.\u0027\n He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but he sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.\n The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.\n \u0027But on the plus side, no Snape today,\u0027 said Ron bracingly.\n Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, \u0027The hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.\u0027\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t bet on it,\u0027 Ron told her cuttingly. \u0027They might not count as clothes. They didn\u0027t look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.\u0027\n Hermione did not speak to him all morning.\n Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of OWLs.\n \u0027What you must remember,\u0027 said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, \u0027is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I\u0027m afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!\u0027\n They then spent over an hour revising Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of Charms homework.\n It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.\n \u0027You cannot pass an OWL,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall grimly, \u0027without serious application, practice and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.\u0027 Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. \u0027Yes, you too, Longbottom,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.\u0027\n She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practising, though Ron said hopefully he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practise the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon.\n Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron\u0027s slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry\u0027s head was aching again.\n The day had become cool and breezy, and as they walked down the sloping lawn towards Hagrid\u0027s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid\u0027s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding towards them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and, judging by the way they all kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty.\n \u0027Everyone here?\u0027 barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. \u0027Let\u0027s crack on then. Who can tell me what these things are called?\u0027\n She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione\u0027s hand shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixie-ish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.\n \u0027Oooooh!\u0027 said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry. Anyone would have thought Hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures; admittedly, the Flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.\n \u0027Kindly keep your voices down, girls!\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. \u0027So--anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?\u0027\n \u0027Bowtruckles,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027They\u0027re tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees.\u0027\n \u0027Five points for Gryffindor,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \u0027Yes, these are Bowtruckles, and as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?\u0027\n \u0027Woodlice,\u0027 said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken to be grains of brown rice were moving. \u0027But fairy eggs if they can get them.\u0027\n \u0027Good girl, take another five points. So, whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a Bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will try to gouge at human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you\u0027d like to gather closer, take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle--I have enough here for one between three--you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body-parts labelled by the end of the lesson.\u0027\n The class surged forwards around the trestle table. Harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n \u0027Where\u0027s Hagrid?\u0027 he asked her, while everyone else was choosing Bowtruckles.\n \u0027Never you mind,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class, too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest Bowtruckle.\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, \u0027the stupid great oaf\u0027s got himself badly injured.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe you will if you don\u0027t shut up,\u0027 said Harry out of the side of his mouth.\n \u0027Maybe he\u0027s been messing with stuff that\u0027s too big for him, if you get my drift.\u0027\n Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who felt suddenly sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death Eater after all; what if he had information about Hagrid\u0027s fate that had not yet reached the ears of the Order? He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a Bowtruckle to remain still long enough for them to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.\n \u0027Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,\u0027 said Hermione at once. \u0027It\u0027s just playing into Malfoy\u0027s hands to look worried; it tells him we don\u0027t know exactly what\u0027s going on. We\u0027ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the Bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face ...\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 came Malfoy\u0027s clear drawl from the group nearest them, \u0027Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry\u0027s really determined to crack down on sub-standard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he\u0027ll probably be sent packing straightaway.\u0027\n \u0027OUCH!\u0027\n Harry had gripped the Bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped, and it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it. Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the Bowtruckle set off at full tilt towards the Forest, a little moving stick-man soon swallowed up among the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds, Harry rolled up his blood-stained Bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in Hermione\u0027s handkerchief, and Malfoy\u0027s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.\n \u0027If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ...\u0027 said Harry through gritted teeth.\n \u0027Harry, don\u0027t go picking a row with Malfoy, don\u0027t forget, he\u0027s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you ...\u0027\n \u0027Wow, I wonder what it\u0027d be like to have a difficult life?\u0027 said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together, they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.\n \u0027I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. \u0027And don\u0027t say that Grubbly-Plank woman\u0027s a better teacher!\u0027 he added threateningly.\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t going to,\u0027 said Hermione calmly.\n \u0027Because she\u0027ll never be as good as Hagrid,\u0027 said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.\n The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth-years spilled out of it, including Ginny.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose, and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary hello, \u0027I believe He Who Must Not Be Named is back and I believe you fought him and escaped from him.\u0027\n \u0027Er--right,\u0027 said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes.\n \u0027You can laugh,\u0027 Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing, \u0027but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!\u0027\n \u0027Well, they were right, weren\u0027t they?\u0027 said Hermione impatiently. There weren\u0027t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.\u0027\n Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now.\n \u0027D\u0027you mind not offending the only people who believe me?\u0027 Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.\n \u0027Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Ginny\u0027s told me all about her; apparently, she\u0027ll only believe in things as long as there\u0027s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn\u0027t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.\u0027\n Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too. His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him.\n \u0027I want you to know, Potter,\u0027 he said in a loud, carrying voice, \u0027that it\u0027s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred per cent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.\u0027\n \u0027Er--thanks very much, Ernie,\u0027 said Harry, taken aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like this, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who did not have radishes dangling from their ears. Ernie\u0027s words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Browns face and as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus\u0027s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.\n To nobody\u0027s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of OWLs. Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprouts preferred type of fertiliser, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.\n As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o\u0027clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice yelled, \u0027Oi, Potter!\u0027\n \u0027What now?\u0027 he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what now,\u0027 she said, marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger. \u0027How come you\u0027ve landed yourself in detention for five o\u0027clock on Friday?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Why ... oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!\u0027\n \u0027Now he remembers!\u0027 snarled Angelina. \u0027Didn\u0027t I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with everyone?Didn\u0027t I tell you I\u0027d booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And now you\u0027ve decided you\u0027re not going to be there!\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t decide not to be there!\u0027 said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words. \u0027I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth about You-Know-Who.\u0027\n \u0027Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off en Friday,\u0027 said Angelina fiercely, \u0027and I don\u0027t care how you do it. Tell her You-Know-Who\u0027s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you\u0027re there!\u0027\n She turned on her heel and stormed away.\n \u0027You know what.?\u0027 Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \u0027I think we\u0027d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood\u0027s been killed during a training session, because Angelina seems to be channelling his spirit.\u0027\n \u0027What d\u0027you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?\u0027 said Ron sceptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.\n \u0027Less than zero,\u0027 said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops on to his plate and starting to eat. \u0027Better try, though, hadn\u0027t I? I\u0027ll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno ...\u0027 He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, \u0027I hope she doesn\u0027t keep me too long this evening. You realise we\u0027ve got to write three essays, practise Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a counter-charm for Flitwick, finish the Bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?\u0027\n Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.\n \u0027And it looks like it\u0027s going to rain.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that got to do with our homework?\u0027 said Hermione, her eyebrows raised.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Ron at once, his ears reddening.\n At five to five Harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for Umbridge\u0027s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door she called, \u0027Come in,\u0027 in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around.\n He had known this office under three of its previous occupants.\n In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of himself. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody\u0027s days it had been packed with various instruments and artefacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment.\n Now, however, it looked totally unrecognisable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolour kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.\n \u0027Good evening, Mr Potter.\u0027\n Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.\n \u0027Evening, Professor Umbridge,\u0027 Harry said stiffly.\n \u0027Well, sit down,\u0027 she said, pointing towards a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Harry, without moving. \u0027Professor Umbridge. Er--before we start, I--I wanted to ask you a ... a favour.\u0027\n Her bulging eyes narrowed.\n \u0027Oh, yes?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m ... I\u0027m in the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o\u0027clock on Friday and I was--was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it--do it another night ... instead ...\u0027\n He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good.\n \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. \u0027Oh, no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one\u0027s convenience. No, you will come here at five o\u0027clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.\u0027\n Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears. So he told \u0027evil, nasty, attention-seeking stones\u0027, did he?\n She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive effort, Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair and sat down.\n \u0027There,\u0027 said Umbridge sweetly, \u0027we\u0027re getting better at controlling our temper already, aren\u0027t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr Potter. No, not with your quill,\u0027 she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag. \u0027You\u0027re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.\u0027\n She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.\n \u0027I want you to write, I must not tell lies,\u0027 she told him softly.\n \u0027How many times?\u0027 Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.\n \u0027Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,\u0027 said Umbridge sweetly. \u0027Off you go.\u0027\n She moved over to her desk, sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill, then realised what was missing.\n \u0027You haven\u0027t given me any ink,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Oh, you won\u0027t need ink,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice.\n Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies.\n He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harry\u0027s right hand, cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel - yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.\n Harry looked round at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Harry quietly.\n He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill on it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again, the words had been cut into his skin; once again, they healed over seconds later.\n And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realise was not ink, but his own blood. And, again and again, the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.\n Darkness fell outside Umbridge\u0027s window. Harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit there all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill ...\n \u0027Come here,\u0027 she said, after what seemed hours.\n He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.\n \u0027Hand,\u0027 she said.\n He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.\n \u0027Tut, tut, I don\u0027t seem to have made much of an impression yet,\u0027 she said, smiling. \u0027Well, we\u0027ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won\u0027t we? You may go.\u0027\n Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run.\n He had not had time to practise Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a dishevelled Ron keeping him company.\n \u0027How come you didn\u0027t do it last night?\u0027 Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about \u0027doing other stuff, bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words.\n \u0027That\u0027ll have to do,\u0027 he said, slamming the diary shut. \u0027I\u0027ve said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can\u0027t make anything weird out of that, can she?\u0027\n They hurried off to North Tower together.\n \u0027How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you do?\u0027\n Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, \u0027Lines.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not too bad, then, eh?\u0027 said Ron.\n \u0027Nope,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Hey--I forgot-- did she let you off for Friday?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry.\n Ron groaned sympathetically.\n It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday\u0027s Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.\n \u0027I\u0027m in detention!\u0027 Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. \u0027D\u0027you think I\u0027d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?\u0027\n \u0027At least it\u0027s only lines,\u0027 said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. \u0027It\u0027s not as it it\u0027s a dreadful punishment, really ...\u0027\n Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge\u0027s room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.\n \u0027I can\u0027t believe how much homework we\u0027ve got,\u0027 said Ron miserably.\n \u0027Well, why didn\u0027t you do any last night?\u0027 Hermione asked him. \u0027Where were you, anyway?\u0027\n \u0027I was ... I fancied a walk,\u0027 said Ron shiftily.\n Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.\n The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry\u0027s hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed. Harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but \u0027good evening\u0027 and \u0027goodnight\u0027.\n His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape\u0027s moonstone essay. It was half past two by the time he had finished it. He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next. He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately.\n Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry\u0027s third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words \u0027I must not tell lies\u0027 did not fade from the back of Harry\u0027s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the pointed quills scratching made Professor Umbridge look up.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand herself. \u0027Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn\u0027t it? You may leave for tonight.\u0027\n \u0027Do I still have to come back tomorrow?\u0027 said Harry, picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right one.\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, smiling as widely as before. \u0027Yes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evenings work.\u0027\n Harry had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked back towards Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a strong contender. She\u0027s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she\u0027s an evil, twisted, mad old-\n \u0027Ron?\u0027\n He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven behind his back.\n \u0027What are you doing?\u0027\n \u0027Er--nothing. What are you doing?\u0027\n Harry frowned at him.\n \u0027Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m--I\u0027m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027They just went past with a bunch of first-years, I bet they\u0027re testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can\u0027t do it in the common room now, can they, not with Hermione there.\u0027\n He was talking in a very fast, feverish way.\n \u0027But what have you got your broom for, you haven\u0027t been flying, have you?\u0027 Harry asked.\n \u0027I--well--well, OK, I\u0027ll tell you, but don\u0027t laugh, all right?\u0027 Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. \u0027I--I thought I\u0027d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I\u0027ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not laughing,\u0027 said Harry. Ron blinked. \u0027It\u0027s a brilliant idea! It\u0027d be really cool if you got on the team! I\u0027ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not bad,\u0027 said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry\u0027s reaction. \u0027Charlie, Fred and George always made me keep for them when they were training during the holidays.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ve been practising tonight?\u0027\n \u0027Every evening since Tuesday ... just on my own, though. I\u0027ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn\u0027t been easy and I don\u0027t know how much use it\u0027ll be.\u0027 Ron looked nervous and anxious. \u0027Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts. They haven\u0027t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect.\u0027\n \u0027I wish I was going to be there,\u0027 said Harry bitterly, as they set off together towards the common room.\n \u0027Yeah, so do-- Harry, what\u0027s that on the back of your hand?\u0027\n Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.\n \u0027It\u0027s just a cut --it\u0027s nothing--it\u0027s--\u0027\n But Ron had grabbed Harry\u0027s forearm and pulled the back of Harry\u0027s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then, looking sick, he released Harry.\n \u0027I thought you said she was just giving you lines?\u0027\n Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge\u0027s office.\n \u0027The old hag!\u0027 Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame. \u0027She\u0027s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry at once. \u0027I\u0027m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she\u0027s got to me.\u0027\n \u0027Got to you?You can\u0027t let her get away with this!\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know how much power McGonagall\u0027s got over her,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry flatly.\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s got enough on his mind,\u0027 said Harry, but that was not the true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since June.\n \u0027Well, I reckon you should--\u0027 Ron began, but he was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, \u0027Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?\u0027\n Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry automatically glanced towards the staff table when he entered the Great Hall, it was without any real hope of seeing Hagrid, and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge.\n Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron\u0027s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.\n At five o\u0027clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge\u0027s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, and was told to enter. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.\n \u0027You know what to do, Mr. Potter,\u0027 said Umbridge, smiling sweetly at him.\n Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right ... on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table, he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.\n I must not tell lies,Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh.\n I must not tell lies.The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.\n I must not tell lies.Blood trickled down his wrist.\n He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared to watch. Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn\u0027t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment shining with blood.\n I must not tell lies.\n I must not tell lies.\n He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it; when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge\u0027s quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening, and Harry doubted he would be able to see the sixth and seventh people at all.\n I must not tell lies.\n I must not tell lies.\n The parchment was now dotted with drops of blood from the back of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.\n \u0027Let\u0027s see if you\u0027ve got the message yet, shall we?\u0027 said Umbridge\u0027s soft voice half an hour later.\n She moved towards him, stretching out her short ringed fingers for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.\n He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.\n \u0027Yes, it hurts, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 she said softly.\n He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead?\n \u0027Well, I think I\u0027ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.\u0027\n He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could.\n Stay calm, he told himself, as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it doesn\u0027t necessarily mean what you think it means ...\n \u0027Mimbulus mimbletonia!\u0027 he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forwards once more.\n A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running towards him, beaming all over his face and slopping Butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching.\n \u0027Harry, I did it, I\u0027m in, I\u0027m Keeper!\u0027\n \u0027What? Oh-- brilliant!\u0027 said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.\n \u0027Have a Butterbeer.\u0027 Ron pressed a bottle on him. \u0027I can\u0027t believe it--where\u0027s Hermione gone?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s there,\u0027 said Fred, who was also swigging Butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand.\n \u0027Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,\u0027 said Ron, looking slightly put out.\n \u0027Let her sleep,\u0027 said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of the first-years gathered around them bore unmistakeable signs of recent nosebleeds.\n Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver\u0027s old robes fit you,\u0027 called Kade Bell, \u0027we can take off his name and put yours on instead ...\u0027\n As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.\n \u0027Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,\u0027 she said abruptly. \u0027It\u0027s stressful this managing lark, you know, I\u0027m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.\u0027 She was watching Ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.\n \u0027Look, I know he\u0027s your best mate, but he\u0027s not fabulous,\u0027 she said bluntly. \u0027I think with a bit of training he\u0027ll be all right, though. He comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I\u0027m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper\u0027s a real whiner, he\u0027s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky\u0027s involved in all sorts of societies. She admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charms Club she\u0027d put Charms first. Anyway, we\u0027re having a practice session at two o\u0027clock tomorrow, so just make sure you\u0027re there this time. And do me a favour and help Ron as much as you can, OK?\u0027\n He nodded, and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.\n \u0027Oh, Harry, it\u0027s you ... good about Ron, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 she said blearily. \u0027I\u0027m just so--so--so tired,\u0027 she yawned. \u0027I was up until one o\u0027clock making more hats. They\u0027re disappearing like mad!\u0027\n And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.\n \u0027Great,\u0027 said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. \u0027Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge\u0027s office and she touched my arm ...\u0027\n Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished, she said slowly, \u0027You\u0027re worried You-Know-Who\u0027s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Harry, dropping his voice, \u0027it\u0027s a possibility, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. \u0027But I don\u0027t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he\u0027s properly alive again now, isn\u0027t he, he\u0027s got his own body, he wouldn\u0027t need to share someone else\u0027s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose ...\u0027\n Harry watched Fred, George and Lee Jordan juggling empty Butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, \u0027But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn\u0027t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn\u0027t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it\u0027s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s evil,\u0027 said Harry flatly. \u0027Twisted.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s horrible, yes, but ... Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.\u0027\n It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.\n \u0027I\u0027m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it\u0027s not a big deal. It\u0027s been hurting on and off all summer--it was just a bit worse tonight, that\u0027s all--\u0027\n \u0027Harry, I\u0027m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this--\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, before he could stop himself, \u0027that\u0027s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn\u0027t it, my scar?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t say that, it\u0027s not true!\u0027\n \u0027I think I\u0027ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks--\u0027\n \u0027Harry, you can\u0027t put something like that in a letter!\u0027 said Hermione, looking alarmed. \u0027Don\u0027t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can\u0027t guarantee owls aren\u0027t being intercepted any more!\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right, I won\u0027t tell him, then!\u0027 said Harry irritably. He got to his feet. \u0027I\u0027m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?\u0027\n \u0027Oh no,\u0027 said Hermione, looking relieved, \u0027if you\u0027re going that means I can go too, without being rude. I\u0027m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it\u0027s quite fun, I\u0027m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.\u0027\n Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.\n \u0027Er ... no, I don\u0027t think I will, thanks,\u0027 he said. \u0027Er--not tomorrow. I\u0027ve got loads of homework to do ...\u0027\n And he traipsed off to the boys\u0027 stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-13.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
