I don\u0027t want ...\u0027 He was gibbering as he tried to pull away from Professor Tofty, who was looking at Harry with much concern after helping him out into the Entrance Hall with the students all around them staring. I\u0027m--I\u0027m fine, sir,\u0027 Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his face. \u0027Really ... I just fell asleep ... had a nightmare ...\u0027 \u0027Pressure of examinations!\u0027 said the old wizard sympathetically, patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. \u0027It happens, young man, it happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry wildly. \u0027I mean ... no ... I\u0027ve done--done as much as I can, I think ...\u0027 \u0027Very well, very well,\u0027 said the old wizard gently. \u0027I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 said Harry, nodding vigorously. \u0027Thanks very much.\u0027 The second that the old man\u0027s heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, Harry ran up the marble staircase, hurtled along the corridors so fast the portraits he passed muttered reproaches, up more flights of stairs, and finally burst like a hurricane through the double doors of the hospital wing, causing Madam Pomfrey--who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague\u0027s open mouth--to shriek in alarm. \u0027Potter, what do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 \u0027I need to see Professor McGonagall,\u0027 gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs. \u0027Now ... it\u0027s urgent!\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not here, Potter,\u0027 said Madam Pomfrey sadly. \u0027She was transferred to St. Mungo\u0027s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age? It\u0027s a wonder they didn\u0027t kill her.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s ... gone?\u0027 said Harry, shocked. The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him. There was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present ... \u0027I don\u0027t wonder you\u0027re shocked, Potter,\u0027 said Madam Pomfrey, with a kind of fierce approval in her face. \u0027As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face-on by daylight! Cowardice, that\u0027s what it was ... despicable cowardice ... if I wasn\u0027t worried what would happen to you students without me, I\u0027d resign in protest.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry blankly. He wheeled around and strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do ... Ron and Hermione, said a voice in his head. He was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious to their angry protests. He sprinted, back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying towards him. \u0027Harry!\u0027 said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. \u0027What happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?\u0027 \u0027Where have you been?\u0027 demanded Ron. \u0027Come with me,\u0027 Harry said quickly. \u0027Come on, I\u0027ve got to tell you something.\u0027 He led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside, and leaned against it, facing them. \u0027Voldemorts got Sirius.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027How d\u0027you--?\u0027 \u0027Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.\u0027 \u0027But--but where? How?\u0027 said Hermione, whose face was white. \u0027I dunno how,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But I know exactly where. There\u0027s a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and they\u0027re at the end of row ninety-seven ... he\u0027s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there ... he\u0027s torturing him ... says he\u0027ll end by killing him!\u0027 Harry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself. \u0027How\u0027re we going to get there?\u0027 he asked them. There was a moment\u0027s silence. Then Ron said, \u0027G-get there?\u0027 \u0027Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!\u0027 Harry said loudly. \u0027But--Harry ...\u0027 said Ron weakly. \u0027What? What?\u0027 said Harry. He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable. \u0027Harry,\u0027 said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, \u0027er ... how ... how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realising he was there?\u0027 \u0027How do I know?\u0027 bellowed Harry. \u0027The question is how we\u0027re going to get in there!\u0027 \u0027But ... Harry, think about this,\u0027 said Hermione, taking a step towards him, \u0027it\u0027s five o\u0027clock in the afternoon ... the Ministry of Magic must be full of workers ... how would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry ... they\u0027re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world ... you think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected?\u0027 \u0027I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!\u0027 Harry shouted. \u0027Anyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I\u0027ve been--\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve never been there, Harry,\u0027 said Hermione quietly. \u0027You\u0027ve dreamed about the place, that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not normal dreams!\u0027 Harry shouted in her face, standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her. \u0027How d\u0027you explain Ron\u0027s dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s got a point,\u0027 said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione. \u0027But this is just --just so unlikely!\u0027 said Hermione desperately. \u0027Harry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he\u0027s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?\u0027 \u0027Sirius might\u0027ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,\u0027 said Ron, sounding worried. \u0027He\u0027s been desperate to get out of that house for ages--\u0027 \u0027But why,\u0027 Hermione persisted, \u0027why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?\u0027 \u0027I dunno, there could be loads of reasons!\u0027 Harry yelled at her. \u0027Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn\u0027t care about seeing hurt--\u0027 \u0027You know what, I\u0027ve just thought of something,\u0027 said Ron in a hushed voice. \u0027Sirius\u0027s brother was a Death Eater, wasn\u0027t he? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!\u0027 \u0027Yeah--and that\u0027s why Dumbledore\u0027s been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Look, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 cried Hermione, \u0027but neither of you is making sense, and we\u0027ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there--\u0027 \u0027Hermione, Harry\u0027s seen them!\u0027 said Ron, rounding on her. \u0027OK,\u0027 she said, looking frightened yet determined, \u0027I\u0027ve just got to say this--\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027You ... this isn\u0027t a criticism, Harry! But you do ... sort of ... I mean--don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve got a bit of a--a--saving-people thing?\u0027 she said. He glared at her. \u0027And what\u0027s that supposed to mean, a \"saving-people thing\"?\u0027 \u0027Well ... you ...\u0027 she looked more apprehensive than ever. \u0027I mean ... last year, for instance ... in the lake ... during the Tournament ... you shouldn\u0027t have ... I mean, you didn\u0027t need to save that little Delacour girl ... you got a bit ... carried away ...\u0027 A wave of hot, prickly anger swept through Harry\u0027s body; now could she remind him of that blunder now? \u0027I mean, it was really great of you and everything,\u0027 said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry\u0027s face, \u0027everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do--\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s funny,\u0027 said Harry through gritted teeth, \u0027because I definitely remember Ron saying I\u0027d wasted time acting the hero ... is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?\u0027 \u0027No, no, no!\u0027 said Hermione, looking aghast. \u0027That\u0027s not what I mean at all!\u0027 \u0027Well, spit out what you\u0027ve got to say, because we\u0027re wasting time here!\u0027 Harry shouted. \u0027I\u0027m trying to say --Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it\u0027s the kind of thing he does, he knows you\u0027re the--the sort of person who\u0027d go to Sirius\u0027s aid! What if he\u0027s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst--?\u0027 \u0027Hermione, it doesn\u0027t matter if he\u0027s done it to get me there or not--they\u0027ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo\u0027s, there isn\u0027t anyone from the Order left at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don\u0027t go, Sirius is dead!\u0027 \u0027But Harry--what if your dream was--was just that, a dream?\u0027 Harry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back from him, looking alarmed. \u0027You don\u0027t get it!\u0027 Harry shouted at her, \u0027I\u0027m not having nightmares, I\u0027m not just dreaming! What d\u0027you think all the Occlumency was for, why d\u0027you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things? Because they\u0027re REAL, Hermione--Sirius is trapped, I\u0027ve seen him. Voldemort\u0027s got him, and no one else knows, and that means we\u0027re the only ones who can save him, and if you don\u0027t want to do it, fine, but I\u0027m going, understand? And if I remember rightly, you didn\u0027t have a problem with my saving-people thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or--he rounded on Ron--when it was your sister I was saving from the Basilisk--\u0027 \u0027I never said I had a problem!\u0027 said Ron heatedly. \u0027But Harry, you\u0027ve just said it,\u0027 said Hermione fiercely, \u0027Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you\u0027d done Occlumency properly you\u0027d never have seen this--\u0027 \u0027IF YOU THINK I\u0027M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN\u0027T SEEN--\u0027 \u0027Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!\u0027 \u0027WELL, I EXPECT HE\u0027D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I\u0027D JUST--\u0027 The classroom door opened. Harry, Ron and Hermione whipped around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, closely followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally. \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Ginny uncertainly. \u0027We recognised Harry\u0027s voice. What are you yelling about?\u0027 \u0027Never you mind,\u0027 said Harry roughly. Ginny raised her eyebrows. \u0027There\u0027s no need to take that tone with me,\u0027 she said coolly, \u0027I was only wondering whether I could help.\u0027 \u0027Well, you can\u0027t,\u0027 said Harry shortly. \u0027You\u0027re being rather rude, you know,\u0027 said Luna serenely. Harry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with Luna Lovegood. \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Hermione suddenly. \u0027Wait ... Harry, they can help.\u0027 Harry and Ron looked at her. \u0027Listen,\u0027 she said urgently, \u0027Harry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left Headquarters.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve told you, I saw--\u0027 \u0027Harry, I\u0027m begging you, please!\u0027 said Hermione desperately. \u0027Please let\u0027s just check that Sirius isn\u0027t at home before we go charging off to London. If we find out he\u0027s not there, then I swear I won\u0027t try to stop you. I\u0027ll come, I\u0027ll d--do whatever it takes to try and save him.\u0027 \u0027Sirius is being tortured NOW!\u0027 shouted Harry. \u0027We haven\u0027t got time to waste.\u0027 \u0027But if this is a trick of Voldemort\u0027s, Harry, we\u0027ve got to check, we\u0027ve got to.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 Harry demanded. \u0027How\u0027re we going to check?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll have to use Umbridge\u0027s fire and see if we can contact him, said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. \u0027We\u0027ll draw Umbridge away again, but we\u0027ll need lookouts, and that\u0027s where we can use Ginny and Luna.\u0027 Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, \u0027Yeah, we\u0027ll do it,\u0027 and Luna said, \u0027When you say \"Sirius\", are you talking about Stubby Boardman?\u0027 Nobody answered her. \u0027OK,\u0027 Harry said aggressively to Hermione, \u0027OK, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I\u0027m with you, otherwise I\u0027m going to the Department of Mysteries right now.\u0027 \u0027The Department of Mysteries?\u0027 said Luna, looking mildly surprised. \u0027But how are you going to get there?\u0027 Again, Harry ignored her. \u0027Right,\u0027 said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks. \u0027Right ... well ... one of us has to go and find Umbridge and--and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her--I don\u0027t know--that Peeves is up to something awful as usual ...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 said Ron at once. \u0027I\u0027ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it\u0027s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way.\u0027 It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department. \u0027OK,\u0027 she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace. \u0027Now, we need to keep students right away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin\u0027s bound to go and tip her off.\u0027 \u0027Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\u0027 said Ginny promptly, \u0027and warn people not to go down there because someone\u0027s let off a load of Garrotting Gas.\u0027 Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie; Ginny shrugged and said, \u0027Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.\u0027 \u0027OK,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Well then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we\u0027ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius--\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s not there, Hermione!\u0027 \u0027I mean, you can --can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don\u0027t think you should be in there alone, Lee\u0027s already proved the windows a weak spot, sending those Nifflers through it.\u0027 Even through his anger and impatience, Harry recognised Hermione\u0027s offer to accompany him into Umbridge\u0027s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty. \u0027I ... OK, thanks,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027Right, well, even if we do all of that, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,\u0027 said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, \u0027not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.\u0027 \u0027Five minutes\u0027ll be enough,\u0027 said Harry \u0027C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go--\u0027 \u0027Now?\u0027 said Hermione, looking shocked. \u0027Of course now!\u0027 said Harry angrily. \u0027What did you think, we\u0027re going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!\u0027 \u0027I--oh, all right,\u0027 she said desperately. \u0027You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we\u0027ll meet you at the end of Umbridge\u0027s corridor, OK?\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market Butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius\u0027s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them. \u0027Harry, d\u0027you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Firewhisky--\u0027 But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge\u0027s corridor. \u0027Got it,\u0027 he panted. \u0027Ready to go, then?\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth-years passed them. \u0027So Ron--you go and head Umbridge off ... Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor ... Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear ...\u0027 Ron strode away, his bright-red hair visible right to the end of the passage; meanwhile Ginny\u0027s equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna\u0027s blonde one. \u0027Get over here,\u0027 muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry\u0027s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. \u0027Are--are you sure you\u0027re OK, Harry? You\u0027re still very pale.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow; it had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery ... \u0027Here,\u0027 he said; he threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them. \u0027You can\u0027t come down here!\u0027 Ginny was calling to the crowd. \u0027No, sorry, you\u0027re going to have to go round by the swivelling staircase, someone\u0027s let off Garrotting Gas just along here--\u0027 They could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, \u0027I can\u0027t see no gas.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s because it\u0027s colourless,\u0027 said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, \u0027but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we\u0027ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who doesn\u0027t believe us.\u0027 Slowly, the crowd thinned. The news about the Garrotting Gas seemed to have spread; people were not coming this way any more. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, \u0027I think that\u0027s as good as we\u0027re going to get, Harry--come on, let\u0027s do it.\u0027 They moved forwards, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, \u0027Good one ... don\u0027t forget the signal.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s the signal?\u0027 muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge\u0027s door. \u0027A loud chorus of \"Weasley is our King\" if they see Umbridge coming,\u0027 replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius\u0027s knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open and they entered the office. The garish kittens were basking in the late-afternoon sunshine that was warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and unoccupied as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. \u0027I thought she might have added extra security after the second Niffler.\u0027 They pulled off the Cloak; Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried, \u0027Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\u0027 His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted on the cold office floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out at the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place. There was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach at the sight of the deserted room. \u0027Sirius?\u0027 he shouted. \u0027Sirius, are you there?\u0027 His voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire. \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse. Kreacher the house-elf crept into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged. \u0027It\u0027s the Potter boy\u0027s head in the fire,\u0027 Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. \u0027What has he come for, Kreacher wonders?\u0027 \u0027Where\u0027s Sirius, Kreacher?\u0027 Harry demanded. The house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. \u0027Master has gone out, Harry Potter.\u0027 \u0027Where\u0027s he gone? Where\u0027s he gone, Kreacher?\u0027 Kreacher merely cackled. \u0027I\u0027m warning you!\u0027 said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost non-existent in this position. \u0027What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them there?\u0027 \u0027Nobody here but Kreacher!\u0027 said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen. \u0027Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his mistress now, yes, he hasn\u0027t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher\u0027s master has been keeping him away from her--\u0027 \u0027Where has Sirius gone?\u0027 Harry yelled after the elf. \u0027Kreacher, has he gone to the Department of Mysteries?\u0027 Kreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him. \u0027Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,\u0027 said the elf quietly. \u0027But you know!\u0027 shouted Harry. \u0027Don\u0027t you? You know where he is!\u0027 There was a moment\u0027s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet. \u0027Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!\u0027 he said gleefully. \u0027Kreacher and his mistress are alone again!\u0027 And he scurried forwards and disappeared through the door to the hall. \u0027You--\u0027!\u0027 But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head; he inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found himself being dragged backwards through the flames, until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dragged him backwards out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go, as though she were going to slit his throat. \u0027You think,\u0027 she whispered, bending Harry\u0027s neck back even further, so that he was looking up at the ceiling, \u0027that after two Nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take his wand,\u0027 she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand. \u0027Hers, too.\u0027 Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had also just had her wand wrested from her. \u0027I want to know why you are in my office,\u0027 said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered. \u0027I was--trying to get my Firebolt!\u0027 Harry croaked. \u0027Liar.\u0027 She shook his head again. \u0027Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?\u0027 \u0027No one--\u0027 said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt several hairs part company with his scalp. \u0027Liar!\u0027 shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her and he slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw Harry\u0027s wand into the air one-handed and caught it again. There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna and--to Harry\u0027s bewilderment--Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had been gagged. \u0027Got \u0027em all,\u0027 said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forwards into the room. \u0027That one,\u0027 he poked a thick finger at Neville, \u0027tried to stop me taking her,\u0027 he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, \u0027so I brought him along too.\u0027 \u0027Good, good,\u0027 said Umbridge, watching Ginny\u0027s struggles. \u0027Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed. \u0027So, Potter,\u0027 she said. \u0027You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,\u0027 she nodded at Ron--Malfoy laughed even louder--\u0027to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes-- Mr. Filch having just informed me so.\u0027 \u0027Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone.\u0027 Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking. \u0027It\u0027s none of your business who I talk to,\u0027 he snarled. Umbridge\u0027s slack face seemed to tighten. \u0027Very well,\u0027 she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. \u0027Very well, Mr. Potter ... I offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco-- fetch Professor Snape.\u0027 Malfoy slowed Harry\u0027s wand inside his robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realised something; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him save Sirius, were gone--but he had been wrong. There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts--Snape. There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resulting from the Slytherins\u0027 efforts to keep Ron and the others under control. Ron\u0027s lip was bleeding on to Umbridge\u0027s carpet as he struggled against Warrington\u0027s half-nelson; Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feel of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip; Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while lugging at Crabbe\u0027s arms; and Hermione was attempting, in vain, to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings. Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely. He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy entered the room, closely followed by Snape. \u0027You wanted to see me, Headmistress?\u0027 said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference. \u0027Ah, Professor Snape,\u0027 said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. \u0027Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.\u0027 \u0027You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,\u0027 he said, surveying her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. \u0027Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.\u0027 Umbridge flushed. \u0027You can make some more, can\u0027t you?\u0027 she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious. \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said Snape, his lip curling. \u0027It takes a full moon-cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.\u0027 \u0027A month?\u0027 squawked Umbndge, swelling toadishly. \u0027A month!But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked round at Harry. \u0027Well, it doesn\u0027t surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.\u0027 His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry\u0027s, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand ... \u0027I wish to interrogate him!\u0027 repeated Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering lace. \u0027I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth!\u0027 \u0027I have already told you,\u0027 said Snape smoothly, \u0027that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter--and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did--I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much lime for truth-telling.\u0027 Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words. Voldemort\u0027s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately. Voldemort\u0027s got Sirius--\u0027 \u0027You are on probation!\u0027 shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. \u0027You arc being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!\u0027 Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door. \u0027He\u0027s got Padfoot!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027He\u0027s got Padfoot at the place where it\u0027s hidden!\u0027 Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge\u0027s door handle. \u0027Padfoot?\u0027 cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. \u0027What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape?\u0027 Snape looked round at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge. \u0027I have no idea,\u0027 said Snape coldly. \u0027Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little. If Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.\u0027 He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration. \u0027Very well,\u0027 she said, and she pulled out her wand. \u0027Very well ... I am left with no alternative ... this is more than a matter of school discipline ... this is an issue of Ministry security ... yes ... yes ...\u0027 She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily As he watched her, Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand. \u0027You are forcing me, Potter ... I do not want to,\u0027 said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, \u0027but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice ...\u0027 Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face. \u0027The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,\u0027 said Umbridge quietly. \u0027No!\u0027 shrieked Hermione. \u0027Professor Umbridge--it\u0027s illegal.\u0027 But Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand. \u0027The Minister wouldn\u0027t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!\u0027 cried Hermione. \u0027What Cornelius doesn\u0027t know won\u0027t hurt him,\u0027 said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry\u0027s body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most. \u0027He never knew I ordered dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same.\u0027 \u0027It was you?\u0027 gasped Harry. \u0027You sent the dementors after me?\u0027 \u0027Somebody had to act,\u0027 breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry\u0027s forehead. They were all bleating about silencing you somehow--discrediting you --but I was the one who actually did something about it ... only you wriggled out of that one, didn\u0027t you, Potter? Not today though, not now--\u0027 And taking a deep breath, she cried, \u0027Cruc--\u0027 \u0027NO!\u0027 shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. \u0027No--Harry-- we\u0027ll have to tell her!\u0027 \u0027No way!\u0027 yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could see. \u0027We\u0027ll have to, Harry, she\u0027ll force it out of you anyway, what\u0027s ... what\u0027s the point?\u0027 And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode\u0027s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted. \u0027Well, well, well!\u0027 said Umbridge, looking triumphant. \u0027Little Miss Question-all is going to give us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on!\u0027 \u0027Er--my--nee-- no!\u0027 shouted Ron through his gag. Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before. Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her, too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. \u0027I\u0027m--I\u0027m sorry everyone,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027But--I can\u0027t stand it--\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right, girl!\u0027 said Umbridge, seizing Hermione by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her. \u0027Now then ... with whom was Potter communicating just now?\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 gulped Hermione into her hands, \u0027well, he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore.\u0027 Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor\u0027s toes; and even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs. \u0027Dumbledore?\u0027 said Umbridge eagerly. \u0027You know where Dumbledore is, then?\u0027 \u0027Well ... no!\u0027 sobbed Hermione. \u0027We\u0027ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog\u0027s Head--\u0027 \u0027Idiot girl-- Dumbledore won\u0027t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry\u0027s looking for him!\u0027 shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face. \u0027But--but we needed to tell him something important!\u0027 wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears. \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. \u0027What was it you wanted to tell him?\u0027 \u0027We ... we wanted to tell him it\u0027s r--ready!\u0027 choked Hermione. \u0027What\u0027s ready?\u0027 demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione\u0027s shoulders again and shook her slightly. \u0027What\u0027s ready, girl?\u0027 \u0027The ... the weapon,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Weapon? Weapon?\u0027 said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement. \u0027You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor Dumbledore\u0027s orders, of course?\u0027 \u0027Y--y--yes,\u0027 gasped Hermione, \u0027but he had to leave before it was finished and n--n--now we\u0027ve finished it for him, and we c--c--can\u0027t find him t--t--to tell him!\u0027 \u0027What kind of weapon is it?\u0027 said Umbridge harshly, her stubby hands still tight on Hermione\u0027s shoulders. \u0027We don\u0027t r--r-- really understand it,\u0027 said Hermione, sniffing loudly. \u0027We j--j--just did what P--P--Professor Dumbledore told us t--t--to do.\u0027 Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant. \u0027Lead me to the weapon,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not showing ... them,\u0027 said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers. \u0027It is not for you to set conditions,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge harshly. \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again. \u0027Fine ... let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you\u0027d invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th--that would serve you right--oh, I\u0027d love it if the wh-- whole school knew where it was, and how to u--use it, and then if you annoy any of them they\u0027ll, be able to s--sort you out!\u0027 These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge: she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face. Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment, then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. \u0027All right, dear, let\u0027s make it just you and me ... and we\u0027ll take Potter, too, shall we? Get up, now.\u0027 \u0027Professor,\u0027 said Malfoy eagerly, \u0027Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after--\u0027 \u0027I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?\u0027 asked Umbridge sharply. \u0027In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these--\u0027 she gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna \u0027--escape.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed. \u0027And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,\u0027 said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. \u0027Lead on.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-32.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
