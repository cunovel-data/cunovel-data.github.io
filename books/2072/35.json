{"id":111698,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts; Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \u0027To me, Potter,\u0027 repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harry\u0027s insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped, and outnumbered two to one. \u0027To me,\u0027 said Malfoy yet again. \u0027Where\u0027s Sirius?\u0027 Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed; a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry\u0027s left said triumphantly, \u0027The Dark Lord always knows!\u0027 \u0027Always,\u0027 echoed Malfoy softly. \u0027Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\u0027 \u0027I want to know where Sirius is!\u0027 \u0027I want to know where Sirius is!\u0027 mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry\u0027s eyes. \u0027You\u0027ve got him,\u0027 said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \u0027He\u0027s here. I know he is.\u0027 \u0027The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\u0027 said the woman in a horrible, mock baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \u0027Don\u0027t do anything,\u0027 Harry muttered. \u0027Not yet--\u0027 The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \u0027You hear him? You hear him?Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\u0027 \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\u0027 said Malfoy softly. \u0027He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\u0027 \u0027I know Sirius is here,\u0027 said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \u0027I know you\u0027ve got him!\u0027 More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman laughed loudest of all. \u0027It\u0027s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\u0027 said Malfoy. \u0027Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\u0027 \u0027Go on, then,\u0027 said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry\u0027s stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all ... But the Death Eaters did not strike. \u0027Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\u0027 said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry\u0027s turn to laugh. \u0027Yeah, right!\u0027 he said. \u0027I give you this--prophecy, is it? And you\u0027ll just let us skip off home, will you?\u0027 The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: \u0027Accio proph --\u0027 Harry was just ready for her: he shouted \u0027Protego\u0027 before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \u0027Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\u0027 she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \u0027Very well, then--\u0027 \u0027I TOLD YOU, NO!\u0027 Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \u0027If you smash it--!\u0027 Harry\u0027s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, to make sure none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity ... The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange\u0027s face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \u0027You need more persuasion?\u0027 she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \u0027Very well--take the smallest one,\u0027 she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \u0027Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I\u0027ll do it.\u0027 Harry felt the others close in around Ginny; he stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \u0027You\u0027ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\u0027 he told Bellatrix. \u0027I don\u0027t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\u0027 She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \u0027So,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027what kind of prophecy are we talking about, anyway?\u0027 He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville\u0027s arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking; he could feel one of the others\u0027 quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \u0027What kind of prophecy?\u0027 repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \u0027You jest, Harry Potter.\u0027 \u0027Nope, not jesting,\u0027 said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \u0027How come Voldemort wants it? Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \u0027You dare speak his name?\u0027 whispered Bellatrix. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \u0027Yeah, I\u0027ve got no problem with saying Vol-- \u0027Shut your mouth!\u0027 Bellatrix shrieked. \u0027You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood\u0027s tongue, you dare--\u0027 \u0027Did you know he\u0027s a half-blood too?\u0027 said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \u0027Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle--or has he been telling you lot he\u0027s pure-blood?\u0027 \u0027STUPEF--\u0027 \u0027NO!\u0027 A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange\u0027s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it; his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly-white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak; their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix\u0027s shouts. \u0027... at the solstice will come a new ...\u0027 said the figure of an old, bearded man. \u0027DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\u0027 \u0027He dared--he dares--\u0027 shrieked Bellatrix incoherently, \u0027he stands there--filthy half-blood --\u0027 \u0027WAIT UN\u0027I\u0027LL WE\u0027VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\u0027 bawled Malfoy. \u0027... and none will come after ...\u0027 said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \u0027You haven\u0027t told me what\u0027s so special about this prophecy I\u0027m supposed to be handing over,\u0027 he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else\u0027s. \u0027Do not play games with us, Potter,\u0027 said Malfoy. \u0027I\u0027m not playing games,\u0027 said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone\u0027s toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione\u0027s. \u0027What?\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\u0027 Malfoy sneered. \u0027I--what?\u0027 said Harry. And for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \u0027What about my scar?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \u0027Can this be?\u0027 said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \u0027Smash shelves--\u0027 \u0027Dumbledore never told you?\u0027 Malfoy repeated. \u0027Well, this explains why you didn\u0027t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why--\u0027 \u0027--when I say now-- \u0027 \u0027--you didn\u0027t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording ...\u0027 \u0027Did he?\u0027 said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \u0027So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \u0027Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\u0027 \u0027And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\u0027 \u0027About both of you, Potter, about both of you ... haven\u0027t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\u0027 Harry stared into the slitted eye-holes through which Malfoy\u0027s grey eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry\u0027s parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \u0027Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\u0027 he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \u0027And he\u0027s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn\u0027t he come and get it himself?\u0027 \u0027Get it himself?\u0027 shrieked Bellatrix, over a cackle of mad laughter. \u0027The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\u0027 \u0027So, he\u0027s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it--and Bode?\u0027 \u0027Very good, Potter, very good ...\u0027 said Malfoy slowly. \u0027But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell-- \u0027NOW!\u0027 yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed, \u0027REDUCTO!\u0027 Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit; the towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor-- \u0027RUN!\u0027 Harry yelled, as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to fall from above. He seized a handful of Hermione\u0027s robes and dragged her forwards, holding one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forwards through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face; they were all yelling, there were cries of pain, and thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres-- Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads; something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onwards; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout, \u0027Stupefy!\u0027 The hand released him at once-- They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest; he could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione\u0027s voice urging Neville on; straight ahead, the door through which they had come was ajar; Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar; he pelted through the doorway, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, and waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them-- \u0027Colloportus!\u0027 gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \u0027Where--where are the others?\u0027 gasped Harry. He had thought Ron, Luna and Ginny were ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \u0027They must have gone the wrong way!\u0027 whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \u0027Listen!\u0027 whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed; Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar, \u0027Leave Nott, leave him, I say-- his injuries will be nothing to the Dark Lord compared to losing that prophecy. Jugson, come back here, we need to organise! We\u0027ll split into pairs and search, and don\u0027t forget, be gentle with Potter until we\u0027ve got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary--Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left; Crabbe, Rabastan, go right--Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead--Macnair and Avery, through here--Rookwood, over there-- Mulciber, come with me!\u0027 \u0027What do we do?\u0027 Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \u0027Well, we don\u0027t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Let\u0027s get away from this door.\u0027 They ran as quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \u0027Stand aside!\u0027 said a rough voice. \u0027Alohomora!\u0027 As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters\u0027 robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \u0027They might\u0027ve run straight through to the hall,\u0027 said the rough voice. \u0027Check under the desks,\u0027 said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend; poking his wand out from under the desk, he shouted, \u0027STUPEFY!\u0027 A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backwards into a grandfather clock and knocked it over; the second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry\u0027s spell and was pointing his own wand at Hermione, who was crawling out from under the desk to get a better aim. \u0027Avada--\u0027 Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned a desk in his anxiety to help; and pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair, he cried: \u0027EXPELLIARMUS!\u0027 Both Harry\u0027s and the Death Eater\u0027s wands flew out of their hands and soared back towards the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front, Harry hot on his heels, and Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck by what he had done. \u0027Get out of the way, Harry!\u0027 yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted: \u0027STUPEFY!\u0027 The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hour-glasses; the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, sprang back up on to the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered-- The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned; his mask had slipped so that he couldn\u0027t see. He ripped it off with his free hand and shouted: \u0027STUP--\u0027 \u0027STUPEFY!\u0027 screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest: he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a flatter and he collapsed backwards towards the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar on to the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it were nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \u0027Accio wand!\u0027 cried Hermione. Harry\u0027s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said. \u0027Right, let\u0027s get out of--\u0027 \u0027Look out!\u0027 said Neville, horrified. He was staring at the Death Eater\u0027s head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck: they were all gazing, open-mouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man\u0027s head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull; his cheeks becoming smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz ... A baby\u0027s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again; but even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again; thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin ... \u0027It\u0027s Time,\u0027 said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \u0027Time ...\u0027 The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together it began to shrink back to babyhood once more ... There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \u0027RON?\u0027 Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \u0027GINNY? LUNA?\u0027 \u0027Harry!\u0027 Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby\u0027s head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who had ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \u0027You can\u0027t hurt a baby!\u0027 There was no time to argue the point; Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \u0027Come on!\u0027 he said, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood open at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway towards it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room towards them; veering left, he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \u0027Collo--\u0027 began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled: \u0027IMPEDIMENTA!\u0027 Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry\u0027s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \u0027WE\u0027VE GOT HIM!\u0027 yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. \u0027IN AN OFFICE OFF--\u0027 \u0027Silencio!\u0027 cried Hermione and the man\u0027s voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out. He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater. \u0027Petrificus Totalus!\u0027 shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forwards, face down on to the rug at Harry\u0027s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move. \u0027Well done, Ha--\u0027 But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand; a streak of what looked like purple flame passed right across Hermione\u0027s chest. She gave a tiny \u0027Oh!\u0027 as though of surprise and crumpled on to the floor, where she lay motionless. \u0027HERMIONE!\u0027 Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly towards her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville\u0027s head as he emerged--his foot broke Neville\u0027s wand in two and connected with his face. Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognised the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet:Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry\u0027s hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak, his meaning could not have been clearer. Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her ... \u0027Like you won\u0027t kill us all anyway, the moment I hand it over!\u0027 said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly: he had one hand on Hermione\u0027s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don\u0027t let her be dead, don\u0027t let her be dead, it\u0027s my fault if she\u0027s dead ... \u0027Whaddever you do, Harry,\u0027 said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \u0027don\u0027d gib it to him!\u0027 Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder--the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \u0027PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\u0027 The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forwards across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \u0027Hermione,\u0027 Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \u0027Hermione, wake up ...\u0027 \u0027Whaddid he do to her?\u0027 said Neville, crawling out from under the desk to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \u0027I dunno ...\u0027 Neville groped for Hermione\u0027s wrist. \u0027Dat\u0027s a pulse, Harry, I\u0027b sure id is.\u0027 Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \u0027She\u0027s alive?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I dink so.\u0027 There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sound of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby-headed Death Eater in the next room. \u0027Neville, we\u0027re not far from the exit,\u0027 Harry whispered, \u0027we\u0027re right next to that circular room ... if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I\u0027ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift ... then you could find someone ... raise the alarm ...\u0027 \u0027And whad are you going do do?\u0027 said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \u0027I\u0027ve got to find the others,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Well, I\u0027b going do find dem wid you,\u0027 said Neville firmly. \u0027But Hermione--\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll dake her wid us,\u0027 said Neville firmly. \u0027I\u0027ll carry her--you\u0027re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab-- He stood up and seized one of Hermione\u0027s arms, glaring at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione\u0027s limp form over Neville\u0027s shoulders. \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Harry, snatching up Hermione\u0027s wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville\u0027s hand, \u0027you\u0027d better take this.\u0027 Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly towards the door. \u0027My gran\u0027s going do kill be,\u0027 said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \u0027dat was by dad\u0027s old wand.\u0027 Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass-fronted cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them. \u0027He\u0027s never going to notice us,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027C\u0027mon ... keep close behind me ...\u0027 They crept out of the office and back towards the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forwards, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione\u0027s weight; the door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry\u0027s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart, Harry saw that Hermione\u0027s fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \u0027So which way d\u0027you reck--?\u0027 But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \u0027Ron!\u0027 croaked Harry, dashing towards them. \u0027Ginny--are you all--?\u0027 \u0027Harry,\u0027 said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forwards, seizing the front of Harry\u0027s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes, \u0027there you are ... ha ha ha ... you look funny, Harry ... you\u0027re all messed up ...\u0027 Ron\u0027s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry\u0027s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \u0027Ginny?\u0027 Harry said fearfully. \u0027What happened?\u0027 But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \u0027I think her ankle\u0027s broken, I heard something crack,\u0027 whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \u0027Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets; it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark--\u0027 \u0027Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\u0027 said Ron, still giggling feebly. \u0027Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus--ha ha ha--\u0027 A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron\u0027s mouth and burst. \u0027--anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny\u0027s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ...\u0027 Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \u0027And what about Ron?\u0027 said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry\u0027s robes. \u0027I don\u0027t know what they hit him with,\u0027 said Luna sadly, \u0027but he\u0027s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all.\u0027 \u0027Harry,\u0027 said Ron, pulling Harry\u0027s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \u0027you know who this girl is, Harry? She\u0027s Loony ... Loony Lovegood ... ha ha ha ...\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve got to get out of here,\u0027 said Harry firmly. \u0027Luna, can you help Ginny?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, then putting an arm around Ginny\u0027s waist and pulling her up. \u0027It\u0027s only my ankle, I can do it myself!\u0027 said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron\u0027s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley\u0027s. He looked around: they had a one in twelve chance of getting the exit right first time-- He heaved Ron towards a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped in, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \u0027There they are!\u0027 she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione: they were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \u0027Colloportus!\u0027 shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter!\u0027 said a man\u0027s voice. \u0027There are other ways in--WE\u0027VE GOT THEM, THEY\u0027RE HERE!\u0027 Harry span around; they were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \u0027Luna--Neville-- help me!\u0027 The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went; Harry crashed into a tbale and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door: \u0027Colloportus!\u0027 There were footsteps running along behind the doors, every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered; Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall--then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry: \u0027Collo--aaaaaaaaargh ...\u0027 He turned in time to see her flying through the air; five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and on to the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \u0027Get Potter!\u0027 shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him; he dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy-- \u0027Hey!\u0027 said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly towards Harry, giggling. \u0027Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn\u0027t that weird, Harry?\u0027 \u0027Ron, get out of the way, get down--\u0027 But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \u0027Honest, Harry, they\u0027re brains--look--Accio brain!\u0027 The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish: for a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared towards Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unravelling like rolls of film-- \u0027Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it--\u0027 said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards, \u0027Harry, come and touch it; bet it\u0027s weird--\u0027 \u0027RON, NO!\u0027 Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forwards but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron\u0027s arms like ropes. \u0027Harry, look what\u0027s happen--No--no--I don\u0027t like it--no, stop--stop--\u0027 But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron\u0027s chest now; he tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus\u0027s body. \u0027Diffindo!\u0027 yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \u0027Harry, it\u0027ll suffocate him!\u0027 screamed Ginny, immobilised by her broken ankle on the floor-- then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater\u0027s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \u0027STUBEFY!\u0027 shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione\u0027s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters, \u0027STUBEFY, STUBEFY!\u0027 But nothing happened. One of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him. He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish-- He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eater\u0027s laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sight. The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backwards onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the Body-Bind Curse, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry\u0027s face. \u0027Potter, your race is run,\u0027 drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask, \u0027now hand me the prophecy like a good boy.\u0027 \u0027Let--let the others go, and I\u0027ll give it to you!\u0027 said Harry desperately. A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \u0027You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\u0027 said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \u0027You see, there are ten of us and only one of you ... or hasn\u0027t Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s dot alone!\u0027 shouted a voice from above them. \u0027He\u0027s still god be!\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart sank: Neville was scrambling down the stone benches towards them, Hermione\u0027s wand held fast in his trembling hand. \u0027Neville--no-- go back to Ron--\u0027 \u0027STUBEFY!\u0027 Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn. \u0027STUBEFY! STUBE--\u0027 One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \u0027It\u0027s Longbottom, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 sneered Lucius Malfoy. \u0027Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause ... your death will not come as a great shock.\u0027 \u0027Longbottom?\u0027 repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \u0027Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy.\u0027 \u0027I DOE YOU HAB!\u0027 roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor\u0027s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \u0027Someone Stun him!\u0027 \u0027No, no, no,\u0027 said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \u0027No, let\u0027s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents ... unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy.\u0027 \u0027DON\u0027D GIB ID DO DEM!\u0027 roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \u0027DON\u0027D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\u0027 Bellatrix raised her wand. \u0027Crucio!\u0027 Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \u0027That was just a taster!\u0027 said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville\u0027s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \u0027Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\u0027 Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat of his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forwards to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley. Malfoy turned, and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step towards the sunken floor. Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \u0027Are you OK?\u0027 he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \u0027And Ron?\u0027 \u0027I dink he\u0027s all righd--he was still fighding de brain when I lefd--\u0027 The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville\u0027s hand had been only seconds before; both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \u0027Give it to me,\u0027 growled a voice in his ear, \u0027give me the prophecy--\u0027 The man was pressing so tightly on Harry\u0027s windpipe that he could not breathe. Through watering eyes he saw Sirius duelling with a Death Eater some ten feet away; Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix--nobody seemed to realise that Harry was dying. He turned his wand backwards towards the man\u0027s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man\u0027s free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy--\u0027 \u0027AARGH!\u0027 Neville had come lunging out of nowhere; unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione\u0027s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater\u0027s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain. Harry whirled around to face him and gasped: \u0027STUPEFY!\u0027 The Death Eater keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off: it was Macnair, Buckbeak\u0027s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \u0027Thanks!\u0027 Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, duelling so fiercely that their wands were blurs; then Harry\u0027s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped. For a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, but then he saw Moody\u0027s magical eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \u0027Tarantallegra!\u0027 he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap-dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \u0027Now, Potter--\u0027 He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \u0027Protego!\u0027 Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife; the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Neville\u0027s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \u0027Accio proph--\u0027 Sirius had hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry\u0027s fingers but he had managed to cling on to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were duelling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand-tips-- Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \u0027Petrificus Totalus!\u0027 Once again, Dolohov\u0027s arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backwards, landing with a crash on his back. \u0027Nice one!\u0027 shouted Sirius, forcing Harry\u0027s head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew towards them. \u0027Now I want you to get out of--\u0027 They both ducked again; a jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius. Across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back towards the fray. \u0027Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville and run!\u0027 Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked and no longer masked Rookwood; another jet of green light flew over Harry\u0027s head as he launched himself towards Neville-- \u0027Can you stand?\u0027 he bellowed in Neville\u0027s ear, as Neville\u0027s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \u0027Put your arm round my neck--\u0027 Neville did so-- Harry heaved--Neville\u0027s legs were still lying in every direction, they would not support him, and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them: both fell backwards, Neville\u0027s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle\u0027s, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try to save the small glass ball from being smashed. \u0027The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\u0027 snarled Lucus Malfoy\u0027s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy\u0027s wand pressing hard between his ribs. \u0027No--get--off-- me ... Neville--catch it!\u0027 Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \u0027Impedimenta!\u0027 Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now duelling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \u0027Harry, round up the others and GO!\u0027 Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville\u0027s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step--\u0027 A spell hit the stone bench at Harry\u0027s heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below. Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \u0027Come on!\u0027 said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville\u0027s robes. \u0027Just try and push with your legs--\u0027 He gave another stupendous heave and Neville\u0027s robes tore all along the left seam--the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville\u0027s floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \u0027Harry, I\u0027b sorry!\u0027 cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder. \u0027I\u0027b so sorry, Harry, I didn\u0027d bean do--\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter!\u0027 Harry shouted. \u0027Just try and stand, let\u0027s get out of--\u0027 \u0027Dubbledore!\u0027 said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry\u0027s shoulder. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027DUBBLEDORE!\u0027 Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body--they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore\u0027s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line-- Only one pair was still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix\u0027s jet of red light: he was laughing at her. \u0027Come on, you can do better than that!\u0027 he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock. Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore, too, turned towards the dais. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall: his body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backwards through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather\u0027s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind, then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange\u0027s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing--Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second ... But Sirius did not reappear. \u0027SIRIUS!\u0027 Harry yelled. \u0027SIRIUS!\u0027 He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out ... But as he reached the ground and sprinted towards the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \u0027There\u0027s nothing you can do, Harry--\u0027 \u0027Get him, save him, he\u0027s only just gone through!\u0027 \u0027--it\u0027s too late, Harry.\u0027 \u0027We can still reach him--\u0027 Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go ... \u0027There\u0027s nothing you can do, Harry ... nothing ... he\u0027s gone.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-35.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
