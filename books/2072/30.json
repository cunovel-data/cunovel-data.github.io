{"id":111693,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"The story of Fred and George\u0027s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwart\u0027s legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently heard students saying things like, \u0027Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,\u0027 or else, \u0027One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley.\u0027\n Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George\u0027s Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.\n Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge\u0027s office door, through which Fred and George\u0027s Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry\u0027s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.\n Inspired by Fred and George\u0027s example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge\u0027s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.\n Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione\u0027s delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.\n Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration, she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from \u0027Umbridge--itis\u0027. After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.\n But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred\u0027s parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.\n None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George\u0027s departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, \u0027It unscrews the other way.\u0027\n To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.\n \u0027Should we say something?\u0027 said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. \u0027About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?\u0027\n \u0027Course not, he\u0027ll recover,\u0027 said Ron indifferently.\n \u0027Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Harry in a satisfied voice.\n He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands. Harry\u0027s spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron\u0027s grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two.\n \u0027Reparo,\u0027 said Hermione quickly, mending Ron\u0027s cup with a wave of her wand. \u0027That\u0027s all very well, but what if Montague\u0027s permanently injured?\u0027\n \u0027Who cares?\u0027 said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood up drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. \u0027Montague shouldn\u0027t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!\u0027\n \u0027You?\u0027 she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her. \u0027Why should I be worried about you?\u0027\n \u0027When Mum\u0027s next letter finally gets through Umbridge\u0027s screening process,\u0027 said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, \u0027I\u0027m going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if she\u0027s sent another Howler.\u0027\n \u0027But--\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,\u0027 said Ron darkly. \u0027She\u0027ll say I should\u0027ve stopped them leaving, I should\u0027ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something ... yeah, it\u0027ll be all my fault.\u0027\n \u0027Well, if she doe\u0027s say that it\u0027ll be very unfair, you couldn\u0027t have done anything! But I\u0027m sure she won\u0027t, I mean, if it\u0027s really true they\u0027ve got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been planning this for ages.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, but that\u0027s another thing, how did they get premises?\u0027 said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him. \u0027It\u0027s a bit dodgy, isn\u0027t it? They\u0027ll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley. She\u0027ll want to know what they\u0027ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold.\u0027\n \u0027Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,\u0027 said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry\u0027s, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, \u0027I\u0027ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful.\u0027\n \u0027He hasn\u0027t,\u0027 said Harry curtly.\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027 said Ron and Hermione together.\n \u0027Because--\u0027 Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. \u0027Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.\u0027\n There was a shocked silence, then Hermione\u0027s teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.\n \u0027Oh, Harry, you didn\u0027t!\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Yes, I did,\u0027 said Harry mutinously. \u0027And I don\u0027t regret it, either. I didn\u0027t need the gold and they\u0027ll be great at running a joke shop.\u0027\n \u0027But this is excellent!\u0027 said Ron, looking thrilled. \u0027It\u0027s all your fault, Harry--Mum can\u0027t blame me at all! Can I tell her?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, I suppose you\u0027d better,\u0027 said Harry dully, \u0027 \u0027specially if she thinks they\u0027re receiving stolen cauldrons or something.\u0027\n Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack before long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air.\n Harry interrupted her before she had even started.\n \u0027It\u0027s no good nagging me, it\u0027s done,\u0027 he said firmly. \u0027Fred and George have got the gold-- spent a good bit of it, too, by the sounds of it--and I can\u0027t get it back from them and I don\u0027t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.\u0027\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t going to say anything about Fred and George!\u0027 she said in an injured voice.\n Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look.\n \u0027No, I wasn\u0027t!\u0027 she said angrily. \u0027As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he\u0027s going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons!\u0027\n Harry\u0027s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George\u0027s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of what to tell them; he had ended up saying, truthfully, that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.\n \u0027You can\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve stopped having funny dreams,\u0027 Hermione said now, \u0027because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night.\u0027\n Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself.\n \u0027You were only muttering a bit,\u0027 he mumbled apologetically. \u0027Something about \"just a bit further\".\u0027\n \u0027I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,\u0027 Harry lied brutally. \u0027I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle.\u0027\n Ron\u0027s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.\n Last night, he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres.\n He had hurried straight towards row number ninety-seven, turned left and run along it ... it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud ... just a bit further ... for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake ... and before he had reached the end of the row, he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his four-poster.\n \u0027You are trying to block your mind, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 said. Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. \u0027You are keeping going with your Occlumency?\u0027\n \u0027Of course I am,\u0027 said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs, that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.\n The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind--the part that often spoke in Hermione\u0027s voice--now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach the journey\u0027s end.\n \u0027You know,\u0027 said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, \u0027if Montague doesn\u0027t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, I s\u0027pose so,\u0027 said Harry, glad of a change of subject.\n \u0027I mean, we\u0027ve won one, lost one--if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday--\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to. Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him.\n The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron\u0027s abysmal goal-keeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.\n \u0027I mean, I can\u0027t get any worse, can I?\u0027 he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. \u0027Nothing to lose now, is there?\u0027\n \u0027You know,\u0027 said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, \u0027I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence.\u0027\n Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.\n \u0027Oh, gosh, I forgot!\u0027 said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. \u0027Cho will be playing, won\u0027t she?\u0027\n Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.\n They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, ckar day; Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027.\n Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto.\n \u0027... Bradley ... Davies ... Chang,\u0027 he said, and Harry felt his stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze.He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more, except that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy.\n \u0027And they\u0027re off!\u0027 said Lee. \u0027And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well ... he\u0027s going straight for goal! He\u0027s going to shoot--and--and--\u0027 Lee swore very loudly. \u0027And he\u0027s scored.\u0027\n Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing:\n \u0027Weasley cannot save a thing\n He cannot block a single ring ... \u0027\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 said a hoarse voice in Harry\u0027s ear. \u0027Hermione ...\u0027\n Harry looked round and saw Hagrid\u0027s enormous bearded face sticking between the seats. Apparently, he had squeezed his way all along the row behind, for the first- and second-years he had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else.\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027can yeh come with me? Now? While ev\u0027ryone\u0027s watchin\u0027 the match?\u0027\n \u0027Er ... can\u0027t it wait, Hagrid?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027Till the match is over?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027No, Harry, it\u0027s gotta be now ... while ev\u0027ryone\u0027s lookin\u0027 the other way ... please?\u0027\n Hagrid\u0027s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him this close-up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone.\n \u0027Course,\u0027 said Harry at once, \u0027course we\u0027ll come.\u0027\n He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them. The people in Hagrid\u0027s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible.\n \u0027I \u0027ppreciate this, you two, I really do,\u0027 said Hagrid as they reached the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below. \u0027I jus\u0027 hope she doesn\u0027 notice us goin\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027You mean Umbridge?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027She won\u0027t, she\u0027s got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn\u0027t you see? She must be expecting trouble at the match.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, well, a bit o\u0027 trouble wouldn\u0027 hurt,\u0027 said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted. \u0027Give us more time.\u0027\n \u0027What is it, Hagrid?\u0027 said Hermione, looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the Forest.\n \u0027Yeh--yeh\u0027ll see in a mo\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. \u0027Hey--did someone jus\u0027 score?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027ll be Ravenclaw,\u0027 said Harry heavily.\n \u0027Good ... good ...\u0027 said Hagrid distractedly. \u0027Tha\u0027s good ...\u0027\n They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step. When they reached his cabin, Hermione turned automatically left towards the front door. Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the Forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree. When he realised they were no longer with him, he turned.\n \u0027We\u0027re goin\u0027 in here,\u0027 he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him.\n \u0027Into the Forest?\u0027 said Hermione, perplexed.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027C\u0027mon now, quick, before we\u0027re spotted!\u0027\n Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him.\n \u0027Hagrid, why are you armed?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Jus\u0027 a precaution,\u0027 said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.\n \u0027You didn\u0027t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the Thestrals,\u0027 said Hermione timidly.\n \u0027Nah, well, we weren\u0027 goin\u0027 in so far then,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027An\u0027 anyway, tha\u0027 was before Firenze left the Forest, wasn\u0027 it?\u0027\n \u0027Why does Firenze leaving make a difference?\u0027 asked Hermione curiously.\n \u0027 \u0027Cause the other centaurs are good an\u0027 riled at me, tha\u0027s why,\u0027 said Hagrid quietly, glancing around. \u0027They used ter be--well, yeh couldn\u0027 call \u0027em friendly--but we got on all righ\u0027. Kept \u0027emselves to \u0027emselves, bu\u0027 always turned up if I wanted a word. Not any more.\u0027\n He sighed deeply.\n \u0027Firenze said they\u0027re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore,\u0027 Harry said, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid\u0027s profile.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid heavily. \u0027Well, angry doesn\u0027 cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn\u0027 stepped in, I reckon they\u0027d\u0027ve kicked Firenze ter death--\u0027\n \u0027They attacked him?\u0027 said Hermione, sounding shocked.\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches. \u0027He had half the herd on to him.\u0027\n \u0027And you stopped it?\u0027 said Harry, amazed and impressed. \u0027By yourself?\u0027\n \u0027Course I did, couldn\u0027t stand by an\u0027 watch \u0027em kill \u0027im, could I?\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Lucky I was passin\u0027, really ... an\u0027 I\u0027d\u0027ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha\u0027 before he started sendin\u0027 me stupid warnin\u0027s!\u0027 he added hotly and unexpectedly.\n Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he said, breathing a little more heavily than usud, \u0027since then the other centaurs\u0027ve bin livid with me, an\u0027 the trouble is they\u0027ve got a lot of influence in the Forest ... cleverest creatures in here.\u0027\n \u0027Is that why we\u0027re here, Hagrid?\u0027 asked Hermione. \u0027The centaurs?\u0027\n \u0027Ah, no,\u0027 said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, \u0027no, it\u0027s not them. Well, o\u0027 course, they could complicate the problem, yeah ... but yeh\u0027ll see what I mean in a bit.\u0027\n On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him.\n The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the Forest that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the Thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the Forest.\n \u0027Hagrid!\u0027 said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles, over which Hagrid had stepped with ease, and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the Forest path. \u0027Where are we going?\u0027\n \u0027Bit further,\u0027 said Hagrid over his shoulder. \u0027C\u0027mon, Harry ... we need ter keep together now.\u0027\n It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione\u0027s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry\u0027s arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature; their absence struck him as rather ominous.\n \u0027Hagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?\u0027 said Hermione quietly.\n \u0027Er ... all righ\u0027,\u0027 Hagrid whispered back. \u0027In fact--\u0027\n He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards. Harry caught her just before she hit the Forest floor.\n \u0027Maybe we bes\u0027 jus\u0027 stop fer a momen\u0027, so I can ... fill yeh in,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Before we ge\u0027 there, like.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They both murmured \u0027Lumos!\u0027 and their wand-tips ignited. Hagrid\u0027s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad.\n \u0027Righ\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Well ... see ... the thing is ...\u0027\n He took a great breath.\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s a good chance I\u0027m goin\u0027 ter be gettin\u0027 the sack any day now,\u0027 he said.\n Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.\n \u0027But you\u0027ve lasted this long--\u0027 Hermione said tentatively. \u0027What makes you think--\u0027\n \u0027Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha\u0027 Niffler in her office.\u0027\n \u0027And was it?\u0027 said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n \u0027No, it ruddy well wasn\u0027!\u0027 said Hagrid indignantly. \u0027On\u0027y any-thin\u0027 ter do with magical creatures an\u0027 she thinks it\u0027s got somethin\u0027 ter do with me. Yeh know she\u0027s bin lookin\u0027 fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back. I don\u0027 wan\u0027 ter go, o\u0027 course, but if it wasn\u0027 fer ... well ... the special circumstances I\u0027m abou\u0027 ter explain to yeh, I\u0027d leave righ\u0027 now, before she\u0027s go\u0027 the chance ter do it in front o\u0027 the whole school, like she did with Trelawney.\u0027\n Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands.\n \u0027It\u0027s not the end o\u0027 the world, I\u0027ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I\u0027m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An you lot\u0027ll have Grubbly-Plank, yeh\u0027ll--yeh\u0027ll get through yer exams fine ...\u0027\n His voice trembled and broke.\n \u0027Don\u0027 worry abou\u0027 me,\u0027 he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. \u0027Look, I wouldn\u0027 be tellin\u0027 yer this at all if I didn\u0027 have ter. See, if I go ... well, I can\u0027 leave withou\u0027 ... withou\u0027 tellin\u0027 someone ... because I\u0027ll--I\u0027ll need yeh two ter help me. An\u0027 Ron, if he\u0027s willin\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027Of course we\u0027ll help you,\u0027 said Harry at once. \u0027What do you want us to do?\u0027\n Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.\n \u0027I knew yeh\u0027d say yes,\u0027 said Hagrid into his handkerchief, \u0027but I won\u0027 ... never ... forget ... well ... c\u0027mon ... jus\u0027 a little bit further through here ... watch yerselves, now, there\u0027s nettles ...\u0027\n They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes; Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.\n \u0027Really easy,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Very quiet, now ...\u0027\n They crept forwards and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, Hermione and Hagrid now stood.\n \u0027Sleepin\u0027,\u0027 breathed Hagrid.\n Sure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open. She looked utterly terrified.\n \u0027Hagrid,\u0027 she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, \u0027who is he?\u0027\n Harry found this an odd question ... \u0027What is it?\u0027 was the one he; had been planning on asking.\n \u0027Hagrid, you told us--\u0027 said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, \u0027you told us none of them wanted to come!\u0027\n Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realisation hit him, he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.\n The great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. \u0027It was the curved back of what was clearly--\u0027\n \u0027Well--no--he didn\u0027 want ter come,\u0027 said Hagrid, sounding desperate. \u0027But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!\u0027\n \u0027But why?\u0027 asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted to cry. \u0027Why--what--oh, Hagrid!\u0027\n \u0027I knew if I jus\u0027 got him back,\u0027 said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, \u0027an\u0027--an\u0027 taught him a few manners--I\u0027d be able ter take him outside an\u0027 show ev\u0027ryone he\u0027s harmless!\u0027\n \u0027Harmless!\u0027 said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. \u0027He\u0027s been hurting you all this time, hasn\u0027t he? That\u0027s why you\u0027ve had all these injuries!\u0027\n \u0027He don\u0027 know his own strength!\u0027 said Hagrid earnestly. \u0027An\u0027 he\u0027s gettin\u0027 better, he\u0027s not fightin\u0027 so much any more--\u0027\n \u0027So, this is why it took you two months to get home!\u0027 said Hermione distractedly. \u0027Oh, Hagrid, why did you bring him back if he didn\u0027t want to come? Wouldn\u0027t he have been happier with his own people?\u0027\n \u0027They were all bullyin\u0027 him, Hermione, \u0027cause he\u0027s so small!\u0027 said Hagrid.\n \u0027Small?\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Small?\u0027\n \u0027Hermione, I couldn\u0027 leave him,\u0027 said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard. \u0027See--he\u0027s my brother!\u0027\n Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open.\n \u0027Hagrid, when you say \"brother\",\u0027 said Harry slowly, \u0027do you mean--?\u0027\n \u0027Well-- half-brother,\u0027 amended Hagrid. \u0027Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an\u0027 she went an\u0027 had Grawp here--\u0027\n \u0027Grawp?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Yeah ... well, tha\u0027s what it sounds like when he says his name,\u0027 said Hagrid anxiously. \u0027He don\u0027 speak a lot of English ... I\u0027ve bin tryin\u0027 ter teach him ... anyway, she don\u0027 seem ter have liked him much more\u0027n she liked me. See, with giantesses, what counts is producin\u0027 good big kids, and he\u0027s always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant--on\u0027y sixteen foot--\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes, tiny!\u0027 said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm. \u0027Absolutely minuscule!\u0027\n \u0027He was bein\u0027 kicked aroun\u0027 by all o\u0027 them--I jus\u0027 couldn\u0027 leave him--\u0027\n \u0027Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back?\u0027 asked Harry.\n \u0027She--well, she could see it was right importan\u0027 ter me,\u0027 said Hagrid, twisting his enormous hands. \u0027Bu\u0027--bu\u0027 she got a bit tired o\u0027 him after a while, I must admit ... so we split up on the journey home ... she promised not ter tell anyone, though ...\u0027\n \u0027How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Well, tha\u0027s why it took so long, see,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Could on\u0027y travel by nigh\u0027 an\u0027 through wild country an\u0027 stuff. Course, he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep\u0027 wantin\u0027 ter go back.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Hagrid, why on earth didn\u0027t you let him!\u0027 said Hermione, flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands. \u0027What do you think you\u0027re going to do with a violent giant who doesn\u0027t even want to be here!\u0027\n \u0027Well, now-- \"violent\"--tha\u0027s a bit harsh,\u0027 said Hagrid, still twisting his hands agitatedly. \u0027I\u0027ll admit he mighta taken a couple o\u0027 swings at me when he\u0027s bin in a bad mood, but he\u0027s gettin\u0027 better, loads better, settlin\u0027 down well.\u0027\n \u0027What are those ropes for, then?\u0027 Harry asked.\n He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them.\n \u0027You have to keep him tied up?\u0027 said Hermione faintly.\n \u0027Well ... yeah ...\u0027 said Hagrid, looking anxious. \u0027See--it\u0027s like I say--he doesn\u0027 really know \u0027is own strength.\u0027\n Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the Forest.\n \u0027So, what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?\u0027 Hermione asked apprehensively.\n \u0027Look after him,\u0027 said Hagrid croakily. \u0027After I\u0027m gone.\u0027\n Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked.\n \u0027What--what does that involve, exactly?\u0027 Hermione enquired.\n \u0027Not food or anythin\u0027!\u0027 said Hagrid eagerly. \u0027He can get his own food, no problem. Birds an\u0027 deer an\u0027 stuff ... no, it\u0027s company he needs. I xxjus\u0027 knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit ... teachin\u0027 him, yeh know.\u0027\n Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like an oversized human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as Grawp\u0027s head. It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the colour of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon\u0027s, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad; and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body. Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor.\n \u0027You want us to teach him,\u0027 Harry said in a hollow voice. He now understood what Firenze\u0027s warning had meant. His attempt is not working. He would do better to abandon it.Of course, the other creatures who lived in the Forest would have heard Hagrid\u0027s fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English.\n \u0027Yeah--even if yeh jus\u0027 talk ter him a bit,\u0027 said Hagrid hopefully. \u0027 \u0027Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he\u0027ll understand more that we all like \u0027im really, an\u0027 want \u0027im ter stay.\u0027\n Harry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face.\n \u0027Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 he said, and she gave a very shaky laugh.\n \u0027Yeh\u0027ll do it, then?\u0027 said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caugit what Harry had just said.\n \u0027We\u0027ll ...\u0027 said Harry, already bound by his promise. \u0027We\u0027ll try, Hagrid.\u0027\n \u0027I knew I could count on yeh, Harry,\u0027 Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again. \u0027An\u0027 I don\u0027 wan\u0027 yeh ter put yerself out too much, like ... I know yeh\u0027ve got exams ... if yeh could jus\u0027 nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an\u0027 have a little chat with \u0027im. I\u0027ll wake \u0027im up, then--introduce yeh--\u0027\n \u0027Wha--no!\u0027 said Hermione, jumping up. \u0027Hagrid, no, don\u0027t wake him, really, we don\u0027t need--\u0027\n But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp. When he was about ten feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.\n The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees. He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.\n \u0027All righ\u0027, Grawpy?\u0027 said Hagrid, in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. \u0027Had a nice sleep, eh?\u0027\n Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.\n \u0027Oh my!\u0027 Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.\n The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp\u0027s wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird\u0027s nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.\n \u0027Anyway, Grawpy,\u0027 shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, \u0027I\u0027ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an\u0027 leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?\u0027\n But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.\n \u0027Now, Grawpy, don\u0027 do that!\u0027 shouted Hagrid. \u0027Tha\u0027s how you ended up pullin\u0027 up the others-- \u0027\n And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree\u0027s roots beginning to crack.\n \u0027I got company for yeh!\u0027 Hagrid shouted. \u0027Company, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Hagrid, don\u0027t,\u0027 moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp\u0027s knee a sharp poke.\n The giant let go of the top of the tree, which swayed alarmingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of pine needles, and looked down.\n \u0027This,\u0027 said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Herrmone stood, \u0027is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh\u0027 be comin\u0027 ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?\u0027\n The giant had only just realised that Harry and Hermione were there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.\n \u0027An\u0027 this is Hermione, see? Her--\u0027 Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione, he said, \u0027Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On\u0027y it\u0027s a difficult name fer him ter remember.\u0027\n \u0027No, not at all,\u0027 squeaked Hermione.\n \u0027This is Hermy, Grawp! An\u0027 she\u0027s gonna be comin\u0027 an\u0027 all! Is\u0027n\u0027 tha\u0027 nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter--GRAWPY, NO!\u0027\n Grawp\u0027s hand had shot out of nowhere towards Hermione; Harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree, so that Grawp\u0027s fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.\n \u0027BAD BOY, GRAWPY!\u0027 they heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. \u0027VERY BAD BOY! YEH DON\u0027 GRAB--OUCH!\u0027\n Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go.\n \u0027Righ\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow, \u0027well ... there yeh are ... yeh\u0027ve met him an\u0027 --an\u0027 now he\u0027ll know yeh when yeh come back. Yeah ... well ...\u0027\n He looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground.\n \u0027Well, I reckon tha\u0027s enough fer one day,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027We\u0027ll--\u0027er--we\u0027ll go back now, shall we?\u0027\n Harry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.\n Nobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. Hermione\u0027s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the Forbidden Forest? And he had promised that he, Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrid\u0027s totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant. How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?\n \u0027Hold it,\u0027 said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they, too, could hear movement close by.\n \u0027Oh, blimey,\u0027 said Hagrid quietly.\n \u0027I thought we told you, Hagrid,\u0027 said a deep male voice, \u0027That you are no longer welcome here?\u0027\n A man\u0027s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green half-light; then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a horse\u0027s chestnut body. This centaur had a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he was armed; a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders.\n \u0027How are yeh, Magorian?\u0027 said Hagrid warily.\n The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him. Harry recognised the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.\n \u0027So,\u0027 he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning immediately to Magorian. \u0027We agreed, I think, what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the Forest again?\u0027\n \u0027\"This human\" now, am I?\u0027 said Hagrid testily. \u0027Jus\u0027 fer stoppin\u0027 all of yeh committin\u0027 murder?\u0027\n \u0027You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,\u0027 said Magorian. \u0027Our ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us.\u0027\n \u0027I dunno how yeh work that out,\u0027 said Hagrid impatiently. \u0027He\u0027s done nothin\u0027 except help Albus Dumbledore--\u0027\n \u0027Firenze has entered into servitude to humans,\u0027 said a grey centaur with a hard, deeply lined face.\n \u0027Servitude!\u0027 said Hagrid scathingly. \u0027He\u0027s doin\u0027 Dumbledore a favour is all--\u0027\n \u0027He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,\u0027 said Magorian quietly. \u0027There can be no return from such disgrace.\u0027\n \u0027If yeh say so,\u0027 said Hagrid, shrugging, \u0027but personally I think yeh\u0027re makin\u0027 a big mistake--\u0027\n \u0027As are you, human,\u0027 said Bane, \u0027coming back into our Forest when we warned you--\u0027\n \u0027Now, yeh listen ter me,\u0027 said Hagrid angrily. \u0027I\u0027ll have less of the \"our\" Forest, if it\u0027s all the same ter yeh. It\u0027s not up ter yeh who comes an\u0027 goes in here--\u0027\n \u0027No more is it up to you, Hagrid,\u0027 said Magorian smoothly. \u0027I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young--\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re not his!\u0027 interrupted Bane contemptuously. \u0027Students, Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited from the traitor Firenze\u0027s teachings.\u0027\n \u0027Nevertheless,\u0027 said Magorian calmly, \u0027the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime--we do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027 be kept outta the Fores\u0027 by a bunch o\u0027 old mules like yeh!\u0027 said Hagrid loudly.\n \u0027Hagrid,\u0027 said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground, \u0027let\u0027s go, please let\u0027s go!\u0027\n Hagrid moved forwards, but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.\n \u0027We know what you are keeping in the Forest, Hagrid!\u0027 Magorian called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. \u0027And our tolerance is waning!\u0027\n Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian.\n \u0027Yeh\u0027ll tolerate \u0027im as long as he\u0027s here, it\u0027s as much his Forest as yours!\u0027 he yelled, as Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid\u0027s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him; he seemed not to have felt it.\n \u0027Calm down, you two,\u0027 he said, turning to walk on while they parted along behind him. \u0027Ruddy old mules, though, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Hagrid,\u0027 said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, \u0027if the centaurs don\u0027t want humans in the Forest, it doesn\u0027t really look as though Harry and I will be able--\u0027\n \u0027Ah, you heard what they said,\u0027 said Hagrid dismissively, \u0027they wouldn\u0027t hurt foals--I mean, kids. Anyway, we can\u0027 let ourselves be pushed aroun\u0027 by that lot.\u0027\n \u0027Nice try,\u0027 Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.\n At last they rejoined the path and, after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin; they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting.\n \u0027Was that another goal?\u0027 asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. \u0027Or d\u0027yeh reckon the match is over?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of twigs and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms. He knew he must look little better.\n \u0027I reckon it\u0027s over, yeh know!\u0027 said Hagrid, still squinting towards the stadium. \u0027Look-- there\u0027s people comin\u0027 out already--if yeh two hurry yeh\u0027ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an\u0027 no one\u0027ll know yeh weren\u0027t there!\u0027\n \u0027Good idea,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Well ... see you later, then, Hagrid.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe him,\u0027 said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. \u0027I don\u0027t believe him. I really don\u0027t believe him.\u0027\n \u0027Calm down,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Calm down!\u0027 she said feverishly. \u0027A giant! A giant in the Forest! And we\u0027re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I--don\u0027t--believe-- him!\u0027\n \u0027We haven\u0027t got to do anything yet!\u0027 Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle. \u0027He\u0027s not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come off it, Harry!\u0027 said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her. \u0027Of course he\u0027s going to be chucked out and, to be perfectly honest, after what we\u0027ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?\u0027\n There was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled slowly with tears.\n \u0027You didn\u0027t mean that,\u0027 said Harry quietly.\n \u0027No ... well ... all right ... I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said, wiping her eyes angrily. \u0027But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself--for us?\u0027\n \u0027I dunno--\u0027\n \u0027Weasley is our King,\n Weasley is our King,\n He didn\u0027t let the Quaffle in,\n Weasley is our King ...\u0027\n \u0027And I wish they\u0027d stop singing that stupid song,\u0027 said Hermione miserably, \u0027haven\u0027t they gloated enough?\u0027\n A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.\n \u0027Oh, let\u0027s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,\u0027 said Hermione.\n \u0027Weasley can save anything,\n He never leaves a single ring,\n That\u0027s why Gryffindors all sing:\n Weasley is our King. \u0027\n \u0027Hermione ...\u0027 said Harry slowly.\n The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle, bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders.\n \u0027Weasley is our King,\n Weasley is our King,\n He didn\u0027t let the Quaffle in,\n Weasley is our King ...\u0027\n \u0027No?\u0027 said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n \u0027YES!\u0027 said Harry loudly.\n \u0027HARRY! HERMIONE!\u0027 yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. \u0027WE DID IT! WE WON!\u0027\n They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron\u0027s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027 died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.\n \u0027We\u0027ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Yes, all right,\u0027 said Hermione wearily. \u0027I\u0027m not in any hurry.\u0027\n They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-30.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
