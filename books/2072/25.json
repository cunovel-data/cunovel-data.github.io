{"id":111690,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Harry\u0027s question was answered the very next morning. When Hermione\u0027s Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry and Ron together.\n For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards\u0027 faces and the tenth, a witch\u0027s. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.\n Antonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.\n Algernon Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic secrets to He Who Must Not Be Named.\n But Harry\u0027s eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something--perhaps Azkaban--had taken most of her beauty.\n Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.\n Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.\n MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN\n MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS \u0027RALLYING POINT\u0027\n FOR OLD DEATH EATERS\n \u0027Black?\u0027 said Harry loudly. \u0027Not--?\u0027\n \u0027Shhh!\u0027 whispered Hermione desperately. \u0027Not so loud--just read it!\u0027\n The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.\n Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, confirmed that ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.\n \u0027We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,\u0027said Fudge last night.\u0027Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black\u0027s cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals, and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached.\u0027\n \u0027There you are, Harry,\u0027 said Ron, looking awestruck. \u0027That\u0027s why he was happy last night.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe this,\u0027 snarled Harry, \u0027Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?\u0027\n \u0027What other options does he have?\u0027 said Hermione bitterly. \u0027He can hardly say, \"Sorry, everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort\"--stop whimpering,Ron--\"and now Voldemort\u0027s worst supporters have broken out, too.\" I mean, he\u0027s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn\u0027t he?\u0027\n Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort\u0027s ranks.\n He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once her pouchy toad\u0027s eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently.\n \u0027Oh my--\u0027 said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper.\n \u0027What now?\u0027 said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy.\n \u0027It\u0027s ... horrible,\u0027 said Hermione, looking shaken. She folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to Harry and Ron.\n TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER\n St. Mungo\u0027s Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderich Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by a pot plant. Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death.\n Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bode\u0027s ward at the time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement:\n \u0027St. Mungo\u0027s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.\n \u0027We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode\u0027s bedside table. As his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil\u0027s Snare which, when touched by the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.\n \u0027St. Mungo\u0027s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward.\u0027\n \u0027Bode ...\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Bode.It rings a bell ...\u0027\n \u0027We saw him,\u0027 Hermione whispered. \u0027In St. Mungo\u0027s, remember? He was in the bed opposite Lockhart\u0027s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we saw the Devil\u0027s Snare arrive. She--the Healer--said it was a Christmas present.\u0027\n Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat.\n \u0027How come we didn\u0027t recognise Devil\u0027s Snare? We\u0027ve seen it before ... we could\u0027ve stopped this from happening.\u0027\n \u0027Who expects Devil\u0027s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant?\u0027 said Ron sharply. \u0027It\u0027s not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn\u0027t they check what they were buying?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come on, Ron!\u0027 said Hermione shakily. \u0027I don\u0027t think anyone could put Devil\u0027s Snare in a pot and not realise it tries to kill whoever touches it? This--this was murder ... a clever murder, as well ... if the plant was sent anonymously, how\u0027s anyone ever going to find out who did it?\u0027\n Harry was not thinking about Devil\u0027s Snare. He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium level.\n \u0027I met Bode,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027I saw him at the Ministry with your dad.\u0027\n Ron\u0027s mouth fell open.\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeakable--he worked in the Department of Mysteries!\u0027\n They looked at each other for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her, closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her feet.\n \u0027Where are you going?\u0027 said Ron, startled.\n \u0027To send a letter,\u0027 said Hermione, swinging her bag on to her shoulder. \u0027It ... well, I don\u0027t know whether ... but it\u0027s worth trying ... and I\u0027m the only one who can.\u0027\n \u0027I hate it when she does that,\u0027 grumbled Ron, as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall. \u0027Would it kill her to tell us what she\u0027s up to for once? It\u0027d take her about ten more seconds--hey, Hagrid!\u0027\n Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the Entrance Hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose.\n \u0027All righ\u0027, you two?\u0027 he said, trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace.\n \u0027Are you OK, Hagrid?\u0027 asked Harry, following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws.\n \u0027Fine, fine,\u0027 said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing. \u0027Jus\u0027 busy, yeh know, usual stuff--lessons ter prepare-- couple o\u0027 salamanders got scale rot--an\u0027 I\u0027m on probation,\u0027 he mumbled.\n \u0027You\u0027re on probation?\u0027 said Ron very loudly, so that many of the passing students looked around curiously. \u0027Sorry--I mean--you\u0027re on probation?\u0027 he whispered.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027 \u0027S\u0027no more\u0027n I expected, ter tell yer the truth. Yeh migh\u0027 not\u0027ve picked up on it, bu\u0027 that inspection didn\u0027 go too well, yeh know ... anyway,\u0027 he sighed deeply. \u0027Bes\u0027 go an\u0027 rub a bit more chilli powder on them salamanders or their tails\u0027ll be hangin\u0027 off \u0027em next. See yeh, Harry ... Ron ...\u0027\n He trudged away, out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds. Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand.\n The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry\u0027s indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo\u0027s, Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done.\n Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort\u0027s reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.\n \u0027And I don\u0027t know how you stand it--it\u0027s horrible,\u0027 she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.\n It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers\u0027 voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that, suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet\u0027s version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year.\n It was not only the students\u0027 mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching.\n \u0027They obviously can\u0027t talk freely in the staff room any more,\u0027 said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. \u0027Not with Umbridge there.\u0027\n \u0027Reckon they know anything new?\u0027 said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.\n \u0027If they do, we\u0027re not going to hear about it, are we?\u0027 said Harry angrily. \u0027Not after Decree ... what number are we on now?\u0027 For new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout:\n BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS\n Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information\n that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach.\n The above is in accordance with Educational Decree\n Number Twenty-six.\n Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor\n This latest Decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class.\n \u0027Exploding Snap\u0027s got nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That\u0027s not information relating to your subject!\u0027\n When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of Murtlap.\n Harry had thought the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved Fudge. It seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first.\n Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney\u0027s increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she predicted students\u0027 answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain. Several times he passed her in the corridors--in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room--muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, he would have felt sorry for her--but if one of them was to be ousted from their job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain.\n Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Hermione\u0027s advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a Crup--a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail--since before Christmas, he too seemed to have lost his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons, losing the thread of what he was saying to the class, answering questions wrongly, and all the time glancing anxiously at Umbridge. He was also more distant with Harry, Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before, and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark.\n \u0027If she catches yeh, it\u0027ll be all of our necks on the line,\u0027 he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that might jeopardise his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.\n It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrid\u0027s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt and Quidditch. He took his revenge the only way he could--by redoubling his efforts for the DA.\n Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents\u0027 attackers\u0027 escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo\u0027s and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers\u0027 escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the DA meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them, the Shield Charm--a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker--only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.\n Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during the DA meetings. Harry\u0027s sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving. On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson.\n Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort\u0027s thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort\u0027s mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door.\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s a bit like an illness,\u0027 said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. \u0027A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better.\u0027\n \u0027The lessons with Snape are making it worse,\u0027 said Harry flatly \u0027I\u0027m getting sick of my scar hurting and I\u0027m getting bored with walking down that corridor every night.\u0027 He rubbed his forehead angrily. \u0027I just wish the door would open, I\u0027m sick of standing staring at it--\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not funny,\u0027 said Hermione sharply. \u0027Dumbledore doesn\u0027t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn\u0027t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You\u0027re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.\u0027\n \u0027I am working!\u0027 said Harry, nettled. \u0027You try it some time--Snape: trying to get inside your head--it\u0027s not a bundle of laughs, you know!\u0027\n \u0027Maybe ...\u0027 said Ron slowly.\n \u0027Maybe what?\u0027 said Hermione, rather snappishly.\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s not Harry\u0027s fault he can\u0027t close his mind,\u0027 said Ron darkly.\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 said Hermione.\n \u0027Well, maybe Snape isn\u0027t really trying to help Harry ...\u0027\n Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other.\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 he said again, in a lower voice, \u0027he\u0027s actually trying to open Harry\u0027s mind a bit wider ... make it easier for You-Know--\n \u0027Shut up, Ron,\u0027 said Hermione angrily. \u0027How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.\u0027\n \u0027He used to be a Death Eater,\u0027 said Ron stubbornly. \u0027And we\u0027ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides.\u0027\n \u0027Dumbledore trusts him,\u0027 Hermione repeated. \u0027And if we can\u0027t trust Dumbledore, we can\u0027t trust anyone.\u0027\n With so much to worry about and so much to do-- startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth-years working until past midnight, secret DA sessions and regular classes with Snape-- January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine\u0027s Day spent entirely in her company.\n On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls, Hedwig was not there-- not that Harry had expected her--but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down.\n \u0027And about time! If it hadn\u0027t come today ...\u0027 she said, eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face.\n \u0027Listen, Harry,\u0027 she said, looking up at him, \u0027this is really important. Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?\u0027\n \u0027Well ... I dunno,\u0027 said Harry uncertainly. \u0027Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do.\u0027\n \u0027Well, bring her along if you must,\u0027 said Hermione urgently. \u0027But will you come?\u0027\n \u0027Well ... all right, but why?\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t got time to tell you now, I\u0027ve got to answer this quickly.\u0027\n And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other.\n \u0027Are you coming?\u0027 Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, looking glum.\n \u0027I can\u0027t come into Hogsmeade at all; Angelina wants a full day\u0027s training. Like it\u0027s going to help; we\u0027re the worst team I\u0027ve ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, they\u0027re pathetic, even worse than I am.\u0027 He heaved a great sigh. \u0027I dunno why Angelina won\u0027t just let me resign.\u0027\n It\u0027s because you\u0027re good when you\u0027re on form, that\u0027s why,\u0027 said Harry irritably.\n He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron\u0027s plight, when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to have noticed Harry\u0027s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.\n She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony-tail. Harry\u0027s feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Cho slightly breathlessly.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Harry.\n They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, \u0027Well--er--shall we go, then?\u0027\n \u0027Oh--yes ...\u0027\n They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other\u0027s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them.\n \u0027You really miss it, don\u0027t you?\u0027 said Cho.\n He looked round and saw her watching him.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 sighed Harry. \u0027I do.\u0027\n \u0027Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year?\u0027 she asked him.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, grinning. \u0027You kept blocking me.\u0027\n \u0027And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,\u0027 said Cho, smiling reminiscently. \u0027I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?\u0027\n \u0027Nah, it was Puddlemere United; I saw him at the World Cup last year.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I saw you there, too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\n The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her--no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione--and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.\n \u0027Potter and Chang!\u0027 screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. \u0027Urgh, Chang, I don\u0027t think much of your taste ... at least Diggory was good-looking!\u0027\n The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n \u0027So ... where d\u0027you want to go?\u0027 Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n \u0027Oh ... I don\u0027t mind,\u0027 said Cho, shrugging. \u0027Um ... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?\u0027\n They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, \u0027By Order of the Ministry of Magic\u0027, offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n \u0027It\u0027s funny, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, \u0027remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no dementors anywhere ...\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange\u0027s face to glance up and down the High Street. \u0027Yeah, that is weird.\u0027\n He wasn\u0027t sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren\u0027t bothering to look for them ... it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft\u0027s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry\u0027s face and the back of his neck.\n \u0027Um ... d\u0027you want to get a coffee?\u0027 said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n \u0027Yeah, all right,\u0027 said Harry, looking around. \u0027Where?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, there\u0027s a really nice place just up here; haven\u0027t you ever been to Madam Puddifoot\u0027s?\u0027 she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge\u0027s office.\n \u0027Cute, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Cho happily.\n \u0027Er ... yeah,\u0027 said Harry untruthfully.\n \u0027Look, she\u0027s decorated it for Valentine\u0027s Day!\u0027 said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n \u0027Aaah ...\u0027\n They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n \u0027What can I get you, m\u0027dears?\u0027 said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies\u0027s with great difficulty.\n \u0027Two coffees, please,\u0027 said Cho.\n In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn\u0027t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn\u0027t see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.\n After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during DA meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.\n \u0027Er ... listen, d\u0027you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I\u0027m meeting Hermione Granger there.\u0027\n Cho raised her eyebrows.\n \u0027You\u0027re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D\u0027you want to come with me? She said it wouldn\u0027t matter if you did.\u0027\n \u0027Oh ... well ... that was nice of her.\u0027\n But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all. On the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding.\n A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Beside them, Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips.\n Cho\u0027s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest, just reach out and grab it. Amazing, how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair ...\n But just as he moved his hand forwards, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.\n \u0027He asked me out, you know,\u0027 she said in a quiet voice. \u0027A couple of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.\u0027\n Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come: out with him?\n He said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.\n \u0027I came in here with Cedric last year,\u0027 said Cho.\n In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry\u0027s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.\n Cho\u0027s voice was rather higher when she spoke again.\n \u0027I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you for ages ... did Cedric--did he--m--m--mention me at all before he died?\u0027\n This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.\n \u0027Well--no--\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027There--there wasn\u0027t time for him to say anything. Erm ... so ... d\u0027you ... d\u0027you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?\u0027\n His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last DA meeting before Christmas.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, \u0027let\u0027s not talk about Cedric right now ... let\u0027s talk about something else ...\u0027\n But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.\n \u0027I thought,\u0027 she said, tears spattering down on to the table, \u0027I thought you\u0027d u-- u--understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n--need to talk about it t--too! I mean, you saw it happen, d--didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies\u0027s girlfriend had even unglued herself to look round at Cho crying.\n \u0027Well--I have talked about it,\u0027 Harry said in a whisper, \u0027to Ron and Hermione, but--\u0027\n \u0027Oh, you\u0027ll talk to Hermione Granger!\u0027 she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears. Several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. \u0027But you won\u0027t talk to me! P --perhaps it would be best if we just ... just p--paid and you went and met up with Hermione G--Granger, like you obviously want to!\u0027\n Harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it.\n \u0027Cho?\u0027 he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho.\n \u0027Go on, leave!\u0027 she said, now crying into the napkin. \u0027I don\u0027t know why you asked me out in the first place if you\u0027re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me ... how many are you meeting after Hermione?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not like that!\u0027 said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake.\n Cho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now.\n \u0027I\u0027ll see you around, Harry,\u0027 she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.\n \u0027Cho!\u0027 Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.\n There was total silence within the teashop. Every eye was on Harry. He threw a Galleon down on to the table, shook pink confetti out of his hair, and followed Cho out of the door.\n It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen, he simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.\n \u0027Women!\u0027 he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. \u0027What did she want to talk about Cedric for, anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?\u0027\n He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.\n \u0027Hi, Hagrid!\u0027 he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.\n Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognised him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s yeh, Harry,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Yeh all righ?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m fine,\u0027 lied Harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he didn\u0027t really have much to complain about. \u0027Er--are you OK?\u0027\n \u0027Me?\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Oh yeah, I\u0027m grand, Harry, grand.\u0027\n He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry didn\u0027t know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, \u0027In the same boat, yeh an\u0027 me, aren\u0027 we, \u0027Arry?\u0027\n \u0027Er--\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Yeah ... I\u0027ve said it before ... both outsiders, like,\u0027 said Hagrid, nodding wisely. \u0027An\u0027 both orphans. Yeah ... both orphans.\u0027\n He took a great swig from his tankard.\n \u0027Makes a diff\u0027rence, havin\u0027 a decent family,\u0027 he said. \u0027Me dad was decent. An\u0027 your mum an\u0027 dad were decent. If they\u0027d lived, life woulda bin diff\u0027rent, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah ... I s\u0027pose,\u0027 said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.\n \u0027Family,\u0027 said Hagrid gloomily. \u0027Whatever yeh say, blood\u0027s important ...\u0027\n And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.\n \u0027Hagrid,\u0027 said Harry, unable to stop himself, \u0027where are you getting all these injuries?\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 said Hagrid, looking startled. \u0027Wha\u0027 injuries?\u0027\n \u0027All those!\u0027 said Harry, pointing at Hagrid\u0027s face.\n \u0027Oh ... tha\u0027s jus\u0027 normal bumps an\u0027 bruises, Harry,\u0027 said Hagrid dismissively \u0027I got a rough job.\u0027\n He drained his tankard, set it back on the table and got to his feet.\n \u0027I\u0027ll be seein\u0027 yeh, Harry ... take care now.\u0027\n And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched, and disappeared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling miserable. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about it any further, he heard a voice calling his name.\n \u0027Harry! Harry, over here!\u0027\n Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub. He was still a few tables away when he realised that Hermione was not alone. She was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione\u0027s least favourite people in the world.\n \u0027You\u0027re early!\u0027 said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. \u0027I thought you were with Cho, I wasn\u0027t expecting you for another hour at least!\u0027\n \u0027Cho?\u0027 said Rita at once, twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at Harry. \u0027A girl?\u0027\n She snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.\n \u0027Its none of your business if Harry\u0027s been with a hundred girls,\u0027 Hermione told Rita coolly. \u0027So you can put that away right now.\u0027\n Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again.\n \u0027What are you up to?\u0027 Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione.\n \u0027Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived.\u0027 said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. \u0027I suppose I\u0027m allowed to talk to him, am I?\u0027 she shot at Hermione.\n \u0027Yes, I suppose you are,\u0027 said Hermione coldly.\n Unemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, \u0027Pretty girl, is she, Harry?\u0027\n \u0027One more word about Harry\u0027s love life and the deal\u0027s off and that\u0027s a promise,\u0027 said Hermione irritably.\n \u0027What deal?\u0027 said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. \u0027You haven\u0027t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days ...\u0027 She took a deep shuddering breath.\n \u0027Yes, yes, one of these days you\u0027ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,\u0027 said Hermione indifferently. \u0027Find someone who cares, why don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,\u0027 said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, \u0027How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?\u0027\n \u0027He feels angry, of course,\u0027 said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. \u0027Because he\u0027s told the Minister for Magic the truth and the Minister\u0027s too much of an idiot to believe him.\u0027\n \u0027So you actually stick to it, do you, that He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\u0027 said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. \u0027You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore\u0027s been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?\u0027\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t the sole witness,\u0027 snarled Harry. \u0027There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d love them,\u0027 breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. \u0027A great bold headline: \"Potter Accuses ...\" A sub-heading, \"Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us\". And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you, \"Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who\u0027s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being Death Eaters ...\" \u0027\n The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died.\n \u0027But of course,\u0027 she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, \u0027Little Miss Perfect wouldn\u0027t want that story out there, would she?\u0027\n \u0027As a matter of fact,\u0027 said Hermione sweetly, \u0027that\u0027s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.\u0027\n Rita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027 dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.\n \u0027You want me to report what he says about He Who Must Not Be Named?\u0027 Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.\n \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He\u0027ll give you all the details, he\u0027ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he\u0027ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now--oh, get a grip on yourself,\u0027 she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of Voldemort\u0027s name, Rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of Firewhisky down herself.\n Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, \u0027The Prophet wouldn\u0027t print it. In case you haven\u0027t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he\u0027s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle--\u0027\n \u0027We don\u0027t need another story about how Harry\u0027s lost his marbles!\u0027 said Hermione angrily. \u0027We\u0027ve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no market for a story like that,\u0027 said Rita coldly.\n \u0027You mean the Prophet won\u0027t print it because Fudge won\u0027t let them,\u0027 said Hermione irritably.\n Rita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she said in a businesslike tone, \u0027All right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won\u0027t print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It\u0027s against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don\u0027t want to believe You-Know-Who\u0027s back.\u0027\n \u0027So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?\u0027 said Hermione scathingly.\n Rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of Firewhisky,\n \u0027The Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,\u0027 she said coldly.\n \u0027My dad thinks it\u0027s an awful paper,\u0027 said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eye. \u0027He publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn\u0027t care about making money.\u0027\n Rita looked disparagingly at Luna.\n \u0027I\u0027m guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?\u0027 she said. \u0027Probably, Twenty-five Ways to Mingle With Muggles and the dates of the next Bring and Fly Sale?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Luna, dipping her onion back into her Gillywater, \u0027he\u0027s the editor of The Quibbler.\u0027\n Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm.\n \u0027\"Important stories he thinks the public needs to know\", eh?\u0027 she said witheringly. \u0027I could manure my garden with the contends of that rag.\u0027\n \u0027Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Hermione pleasantly. \u0027Luna says her father\u0027s quite happy to take Harry\u0027s interview. That\u0027s who\u0027ll be publishing it.\u0027\n Rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter.\n \u0027The Quibbler!\u0027 she said, cackling. \u0027You think people will take him seriously if he\u0027s published in The Quibbler!\u0027\n \u0027Some people won\u0027t,\u0027 said Hermione in a level voice. \u0027But the Daily Prophet\u0027s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn\u0027t a better explanation of what happened, and if there\u0027s an alternative story available, even if it is published in a--\u0027 she glanced sideways at Luna, \u0027in a--well, an unusual magazine--I think they might be rather keen to read it.\u0027\n Rita didn\u0027t say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.\n \u0027All right, let\u0027s say for a moment I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 she said abruptly. \u0027What kind of fee am I going to get?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,\u0027 said Luna dreamily. \u0027They do it because it\u0027s an honour and, of course, to see their names in print.\u0027\n Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione.\n \u0027I\u0027m supposed to do this for free?\u0027\n \u0027Well, yes,\u0027 said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. \u0027Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider\u0027s account of life in Azkaban.\u0027\n Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione\u0027s drink and thrust it up her nose.\n \u0027I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ve got any choice, have I?\u0027 said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.\n \u0027Daddy will be pleased,\u0027 said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Rita\u0027s jaw.\n \u0027OK, Harry?\u0027 said Hermione, turning to him. \u0027Ready to tell the public the truth?\u0027\n \u0027I suppose,\u0027 said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.\n \u0027Fire away, then, Rita,\u0027 said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-25.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
