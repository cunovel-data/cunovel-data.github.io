{"id":111673,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.\\n\\n \u0027I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,\u0027 she said as they reached the first landing, \u0027we\u0027ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny\u0027s asleep,\u0027 she added to Hermione, \u0027so try not to wake her up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Asleep, yeah, right,\u0027 said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor. \u0027If Ginny\u0027s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then I\u0027m a Flobberworm....\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, Ron, Harry,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their bedroom. \u0027Off to bed with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027Night,\u0027 Harry and Ron said to the twins.\\n\\n \u0027Sleep tight,\u0027 said Fred, winking.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t let them out to hunt every night,\u0027 Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas. \u0027Dumbledore doesn\u0027t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it\u0027ll look suspicious. Oh yeah ... I forgot....\u0027\\n\\n He crossed to the door and bolted it.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027re you doing that for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher,\u0027 said Ron as he turned off the light. \u0027First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don\u0027t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway...\u0027 He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window, \u0027what d\u0027you reckon?\u0027\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t need to ask what Ron meant.\\n\\n \u0027Well, they didn\u0027t tell us much we couldn\u0027t have guessed, did they?\u0027 he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. \u0027I mean, all they\u0027ve really said is that the Order\u0027s trying to stop people joining Vol--\u0027\\n\\n There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.\\n\\n --demort,\u0027 said Harry firmly. \u0027When are you going to start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do.\u0027\\n\\n Ron ignored this last comment.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, you\u0027re right,\u0027 he said, \u0027we already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit was--\u0027\\n\\n Crack.\\n\\n \u0027OUCH!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum\u0027ll be back up here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You two just Apparated on my knees!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well, it\u0027s harder in the dark--\u0027\\n\\n Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron\u0027s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry\u0027s mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.\\n\\n \u0027So, got there yet?\u0027 said George eagerly.\\n\\n \u0027The weapon Sirius mentioned?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Let slip, more like,\u0027 said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. \u0027We didn\u0027t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you reckon it is?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Could be anything,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027But there can\u0027t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?\u0027 said Ron. \u0027What\u0027s worse than death?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s something that can kill loads of people at once,\u0027 suggested George.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s some particularly painful way of killing people,\u0027 said Ron learfully.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027he doesn\u0027t need anything more efficient than that.\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.\\n\\n \u0027So who d\u0027you think\u0027s got it now?\u0027 asked George.\\n\\n \u0027I hope it\u0027s our side,\u0027 said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.\\n\\n \u0027If it is, Dumbledore\u0027s probably keeping it,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Where?\u0027 said Ron quickly. \u0027Hogwarts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bet it is!\u0027 said George. That\u0027s where he hid the Philosopher\u0027s Stone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A weapon\u0027s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Not necessarily,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,\u0027 said George. \u0027Look at Ginny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shhh!\u0027 said Fred, half-rising from the bed. \u0027Listen!\u0027\\n\\n They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.\\n\\n \u0027Mum,\u0027 said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later, they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking.\\n\\n Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.\\n\\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t trust us at all, you know,\u0027 said Ron regretfully.\\n\\n Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs.... In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, \u0027Beauties, aren\u0027t they, eh, Harry? We\u0027ll be studyin\u0027 weapons this term....\u0027 and Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him.... He ducked....\\n\\n The next thing he knew, he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and George\u0027s loud voice was filling the room.\\n\\n \u0027Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxys than she thought and she\u0027s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.\u0027\\n\\n Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth. Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.\\n\\n \u0027Cover your faces and take a spray,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. \u0027It\u0027s Doxycide. I\u0027ve never seen an infestation this bad--what that house-elf\u0027s been doing for the last ten years--\u0027\\n\\n Hermione\u0027s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher\u0027s really old, he probably couldn\u0027t manage--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,\u0027 said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. \u0027I\u0027ve just been feeding Buckbeak,\u0027 he added, in reply to Harry\u0027s enquiring look. \u0027I keep him upstairs in my mother\u0027s bedroom. Anyway ... this writing desk...\u0027\\n\\n He dropped the bag of rats into an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Molly, I\u0027m pretty sure this is a boggart,\u0027 said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, \u0027but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out--knowing my mother, it could be something much worse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right you are, Sirius,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.\\n\\n A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.\\n\\n \u0027I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!\u0027 said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying out of the room. They heard him thundering clown the stairs as Mrs. Black\u0027s screeches echoed up through the house once more: \u0027Stains of dishonour, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of flith...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Close the door, please, Harry,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing-room door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he recognised as Kingsley Shacklebolt\u0027s saying, \u0027Hestia\u0027s just relieved me, so she\u0027s got Moody\u0027s Cloak now, thought I\u0027d leave a report for Dumbledore....\u0027\\n\\n Feeling Mrs Weasley\u0027s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing-room door and rejoined the doxy party.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in Gilderoy Lockhart\u0027s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.\\n\\n \u0027Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous. I\u0027ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I\u0027d rather nobody needed it.\u0027\\n\\n She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward.\\n\\n \u0027When I say the word, start spraying immediately,\u0027 she said. \u0027They\u0027ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them. When they\u0027re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.\u0027\\n\\n She stepped carefully out of their line of fire, and raised her own spray.\\n\\n \u0027All right--squirt!\u0027\\n\\n Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully-grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetle-like wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairy-like body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, on to the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.\\n\\n \u0027Fred, what are you doing?\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley sharply. \u0027Spray that at once and throw it away!\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked round. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb.\\n\\n \u0027Right-o,\u0027 Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley\u0027s back was turned he pocketed it with a wink.\\n\\n \u0027We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,\u0027 George told Harry under his breath.\\n\\n Deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \u0027What are Skiving Snackboxes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Range of sweets to make you ill,\u0027 George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley\u0027s back. \u0027Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They\u0027re double-ended, colour-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you\u0027ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"--which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.\" That\u0027s what we\u0027re putting in the adverts, anyway,\u0027 whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley\u0027s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket. \u0027But they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Testers?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Us,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies--we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mum thought we\u0027d been duelling,\u0027 said George.\\n\\n \u0027Joke shop still on, then?\u0027 Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we haven\u0027t had a chance to get premises yet,\u0027 said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, \u0027so we\u0027re running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All thanks to you, mate,\u0027 said George. \u0027But don\u0027t worry ... Mum hasn\u0027t got a clue. She won\u0027t read the Daily Prophet any more, \u0027cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.\u0027\\n\\n Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley. She did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.\\n\\n The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ll tackle those after lunch.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.\\n\\n The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n \u0027Stay here,\u0027 she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Blacks screeches started up again from down below. \u0027I\u0027ll bring up some sandwiches.\u0027\\n\\n She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.\\n\\n \u0027Mundungus!\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027What\u0027s he brought all those cauldrons for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Isn\u0027t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, you\u0027re right!\u0027 said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. \u0027Blimey, Mum won\u0027t like that....\u0027\\n\\n He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening closely. Mrs. Black\u0027s screaming had stopped.\\n\\n \u0027Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,\u0027 Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. \u0027Can\u0027t hear properly ... d\u0027you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Might be worth it,\u0027 said George. \u0027I could sneak upstairs and get a pair--\u0027\\n\\n But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.\\n\\n \u0027WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,\u0027 said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley\u0027s voice to permeate the room better, \u0027it makes such a nice change.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN\u0027T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The idiots are letting her get into her stride,\u0027 said George, shaking his head. \u0027You\u0027ve got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she\u0027s been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry--and there goes Sirius\u0027s mum again.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley\u0027s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall.\\n\\n George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.\\n\\n Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.\\n\\n The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog\u0027s, \u0027...smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she\u0027s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress\u0027s house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they\u0027ve let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do....\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Kreacher,\u0027 said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.\\n\\n The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher did not see Young Master,\u0027 he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, \u0027Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said George. \u0027Didn\u0027t catch that last bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher said nothing,\u0027 said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, \u0027and there\u0027s its twin, unnataral little beasts they are.\u0027\\n\\n Harry didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.\\n\\n \u0027...and there\u0027s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she\u0027d cry, and there\u0027s a new boy, Kreacher doesn\u0027t know his name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesn\u0027t know...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is Harry, Kreacher,\u0027 said Hermione tentatively. \u0027Harry Potter.\u0027\\n\\n Kreacher\u0027s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.\\n\\n \u0027The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher\u0027s mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t call her a Mudblood!\u0027 said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 Hermione whispered, \u0027he\u0027s not in his right mind, he doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he\u0027s saying,\u0027 said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.\\n\\n Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that\u0027s the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t we all, Kreacher,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027What do you want, anyway?\u0027 George asked.\\n\\n Kreacher\u0027s huge eyes darted towards George.\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher is cleaning,\u0027 he said evasively.\\n\\n \u0027A likely story,\u0027 said a voice behind Harry.\\n\\n Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen.\\n\\n At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Stand up straight,\u0027 said Sirius impatiently. \u0027Now, what are you up to?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher is cleaning,\u0027 the elf repeated. \u0027Kreacher lives to serve the Noble House of Black--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--and it\u0027s getting blacker every day, it\u0027s filthy,\u0027 said Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027Master always liked his little joke,\u0027 said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, \u0027Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother\u0027s heart--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My mother didn\u0027t have a heart, Kreacher,\u0027 snapped Sirius. \u0027She kept herself alive out of pure spite.\u0027\\n\\n Kreacher bowed again as he spoke.\\n\\n \u0027Whatever Master says,\u0027 he muttered furiously. \u0027Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother\u0027s boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I asked you what you were up to,\u0027 said Sirius coldly. \u0027Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can\u0027t throw it out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master\u0027s house,\u0027 said the elf, then muttered very fast, \u0027Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it\u0027s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought it might be that,\u0027 said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. \u0027She\u0027ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don\u0027t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.\u0027\\n\\n It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.\\n\\n \u0027--comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he\u0027s back, they say he\u0027s a murderer too--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!\u0027 said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf.\\n\\n \u0027Sirius, he\u0027s not right in the head,\u0027 Hermione pleaded, \u0027I don\u0027t think he realises we can hear him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s been alone too long,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027taking mad orders from my mother\u0027s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you could just set him free,\u0027 said Hermione hopefully, \u0027maybe--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,\u0027 said Sirius curtly. \u0027And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.\u0027\\n\\n Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.\\n\\n The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\\n\\n The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black\u0027Toujours pur\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not on here!\u0027 said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely.\\n\\n \u0027I used to be there,\u0027 said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. \u0027My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home-- Kreacher\u0027s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You ran away from home?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When I was about sixteen,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027I\u0027d had enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where did you go?\u0027 asked Harry, staring at him.\\n\\n \u0027Your dad\u0027s place,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad\u0027s in the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold--he\u0027s been wiped off here too, that\u0027s probably why--anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potters for Sunday lunch, though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But ... why did you...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Leave?\u0027 Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long, unkempt hair. \u0027Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal ... my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them ... that\u0027s him.\u0027\\n\\n Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name \u0027Regulus Black\u0027. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth.\\n\\n \u0027He was younger than me,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he died,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027Stupid idiot ... he joined the Death Eaters.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re kidding!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Harry, haven\u0027t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?\u0027 said Sirius testily.\\n\\n \u0027Were--were your parents Death Eaters as well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge. They weren\u0027t alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who thought he had the right idea about things.... They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was he killed by an Auror?\u0027 Harry asked tentatively.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort\u0027s orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don\u0027t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It\u0027s a lifetime of service or death.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lunch,\u0027 said Mrs Weasley\u0027s voice.\\n\\n She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.\\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t looked at this for years. There\u0027s Phineas Nigellus ... my great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had ... and Araminta Meliflua ... cousin of my mother\u0027s ... tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal ... and dear Aunt Elladora ... she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays ... of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn\u0027t on here. Maybe that\u0027s why Kreacher won\u0027t take orders from her--he\u0027s supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him....\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You and Tonks are related?\u0027 Harry asked, surprised.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yeah, her mother Andromeda was my favourite cousin, said Sirius, examining the tapestry closely. \u0027No, Andromeda\u0027s not on here either, look--\u0027\\n\\n He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.\\n\\n \u0027Andromeda\u0027s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so--\u0027\\n\\n Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda\u0027s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re related to the Malfoys!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The pure-blood families are all interrelated,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027If you\u0027re only going to let your sons and daughters marry pure-bloods our choice is very limited; there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur\u0027s something like my second cousin once removed. But there\u0027s no point looking for them on here--if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it\u0027s the Weasleys.\u0027\\n\\n But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda\u0027s burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.\\n\\n \u0027Lestrange...\u0027 Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn\u0027t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re in Azkaban,\u0027 said Sirius shortly.\\n\\n Harry looked at him curiously.\\n\\n \u0027Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior,\u0027 said Sirius, in the same brusque voice. \u0027Rodolphus\u0027s brother Rabastan was with them, too.\u0027\\n\\n Then Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore\u0027s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.\\n\\n \u0027You never said she was your--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it matter if she\u0027s my cousin?\u0027 snapped Sirius. \u0027As far as I\u0027m concerned, they\u0027re not my family. She\u0027s certainly not my family. I haven\u0027t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming into Azkaban. D\u0027you think I\u0027m proud of having a relative like her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Harry quickly, \u0027I didn\u0027t mean--I was just surprised, that\u0027s all--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter, don\u0027t apologise,\u0027 Sirius mumbled. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. \u0027I don\u0027t like being back here,\u0027 he said, staring across the drawing room. \u0027I never thought I\u0027d be stuck in this house again.\u0027\\n\\n Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s ideal for headquarters, of course,\u0027 Sirius said. \u0027My father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here. It\u0027s unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call--as if they\u0027d ever have wanted to--and now Dumbledore\u0027s added his protection, you\u0027d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore\u0027s Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know--nobody can find Headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is--that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore....\u0027 Sirius gave a short, bark-like laugh. \u0027If my parents could see the use their house was being put to now ... well, my mothers portrait should give you some idea.\u0027\\n\\n He scowled for a moment, then sighed.\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I\u0027ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing--as Snuffles, obviously--so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d\u0027you think?\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius\u0027s words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Sirius said. Harry looked up and realised that Sirius had been watching him. \u0027I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll clear you, there\u0027s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if they do expel me,\u0027 said Harry quietly, \u0027can I come back here and live with you?\u0027\\n\\n Sirius smiled sadly.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn\u0027t have to go back to the Dursleys,\u0027 Harry pressed him.\\n\\n \u0027They must be bad if you prefer this place,\u0027 said Sirius gloomily.\\n\\n \u0027Hurry up, you two, or there won\u0027t be any food left,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley called.\\n\\n Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, then he and Harry went to join the others.\\n\\n Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the glass-fronted cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, \u0027must be Wartcap powder in there.\u0027\\n\\n He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket.\\n\\n They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry\u0027s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin. Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature\u0027s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius\u0027s grandfather for \u0027services to the Ministry\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027It means he gave them a load of gold,\u0027 said Sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.\\n\\n Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip, Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.\\n\\n \u0027It was my father\u0027s,\u0027 said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. \u0027Kreacher wasn\u0027t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father\u0027s old trousers last week.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk. Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.\\n\\n They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed.\\n\\n Snape might refer to their work as \u0027cleaning\u0027, but in Harry\u0027s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, \u0027Master must do as Master wishes,\u0027 before turning away and muttering very loudly, \u0027but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudblood and traitors and scum....\u0027\\n\\n At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione\u0027s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.\\n\\n The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius\u0027s mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry\u0027s relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help. Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley\u0027s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.\\n\\n Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes, he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys\u0027 ... but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.\\n\\n He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, \u0027I\u0027ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight, too. A good first impression can work wonders.\u0027\\n\\n Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.\\n\\n \u0027How am I getting there?\u0027 he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.\\n\\n \u0027Arthur\u0027s taking you to work with him,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley gently.\\n\\n Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.\\n\\n \u0027You can wait in my office until it\u0027s time for the hearing,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it.\\n\\n \u0027Professor Dumbledore doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--think he\u0027s quite right,\u0027 said Sirius through clenched teeth.\\n\\n Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips.\\n\\n \u0027When did Dumbledore tell you that?\u0027 Harry said, staring at Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027He came last night, when you were in bed,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\n Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry lowered his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if it were possible, even worse. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-6.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
