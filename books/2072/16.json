{"id":111683,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry\u0027s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.\\n\\n \u0027I was wondering,\u0027 Hermione said suddenly, \u0027whether you\u0027d thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Course I have,\u0027 said Harry grumpily, \u0027can\u0027t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I meant the idea Ron and I had--\u0027 Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look. She frowned at him, \u0027--Oh, all right, the idea I had, then--about you teaching us.\u0027\\n\\n Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.\\n\\n He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters--found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons ...\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, \u0027yeah, I--I\u0027ve thought about it a bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027 said Hermione eagerly.\\n\\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.\\n\\n \u0027I thought it was a good idea from the start,\u0027 said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.\\n\\n Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\\n\\n \u0027You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Harry,\u0027 said Hermione gently, \u0027but all the same, there\u0027s no point pretending that you\u0027re not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can\u0027t, Viktor always said--\u0027\\n\\n Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. Rubbing it, he said, \u0027Yeah? What did Vicky say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ho ho,\u0027 said Hermione in a bored voice. \u0027He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn\u0027t, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.\u0027\\n\\n Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not still in contact with him, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what if I am?\u0027 said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink. \u0027I can have a pen-pal if I--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t only want to be your pen-pal,\u0027 said Ron accusingly.\\n\\n Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, \u0027Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just you and Ron, yeah?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again. \u0027Well ... now, don\u0027t fly off the handle again, Harry, please ... but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we\u0027re talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort. Oh, don\u0027t be pathetic, Ron. It doesn\u0027t seem fair if we don\u0027t offer the chance to other people.\u0027\\n\\n Harry considered this for a moment, then said, \u0027Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I\u0027m a nutter, remember?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you\u0027ve got to say,\u0027 said Hermione seriously. \u0027Look,\u0027 she leaned towards him-- Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forwards to listen too--\u0027you know the first weekend in October\u0027s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who\u0027s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do we have to do it outside school?\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Because,\u0027 said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, \u0027I don\u0027t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.\u0027\\n\\n Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying they didn\u0027t want him to come--but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?\\n\\n \u0027Well, you can\u0027t blame him for wanting to get out and about,\u0027 said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. \u0027I mean, he\u0027s been on the run for over two years, hasn\u0027t he, and I know that can\u0027t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn\u0027t he? And now he\u0027s just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf.\u0027\\n\\n Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher.\\n\\n \u0027The trouble is,\u0027 she said to Harry, \u0027until V-Voldemort--oh, for heaven\u0027s sake,Ron-- comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn\u0027t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn\u0027t going to realise Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore\u0027s been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again, it\u0027ll be obvious Sirius isn\u0027t one ... I mean, he hasn\u0027t got the Mark, for one thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t reckon he\u0027d be stupid enough to turn up,\u0027 said Ron bracingly. \u0027Dumbledore\u0027d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn\u0027t like what he hears.\u0027\\n\\n When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, \u0027Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We\u0027ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Harry,\u0027 Hermione said quietly. \u0027You\u0027ve got enough on your plate without Sirius, too.\u0027\\n\\n She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.\\n\\n The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn\u0027t been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.\\n\\n When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\\n\\n \u0027Er--why was Filch sniffing you?\u0027 asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,\u0027 said Harry with a small laugh. \u0027I forgot to tell you ...\u0027\\n\\n And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.\\n\\n \u0027He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Harry, shrugging. \u0027Maybe Malfoy he\u0027d think it was a laugh.\u0027\\n\\n They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Malfoy?\u0027 said Hermione, sceptically. \u0027Well ... yes ... maybe ...\u0027\\n\\n And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.\\n\\n \u0027Where are we going, anyway?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027The Three Broomsticks?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh--no,\u0027 said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \u0027no, it\u0027s always packed and really noisy. I\u0027ve told the others to meet us in the Hog\u0027s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it\u0027s not on the main road. I think it\u0027s a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students don\u0027t normally go in there, so I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be overheard.\u0027\\n\\n They walked down the main street past Zonko\u0027s Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar\u0027s severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.\\n\\n \u0027Well, come on,\u0027 said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.\\n\\n It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog\u0027s Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.\\n\\n Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: \u0027Yeh get a lot o\u0027 funny folk in the Hog\u0027s Head,\u0027 he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon\u0027s egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog\u0027s Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know about this, Hermione,\u0027 Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. \u0027Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?\u0027\\n\\n Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure.\\n\\n \u0027Umbridge is shorter than that woman,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there\u0027s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I\u0027ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. We\u0027re not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog\u0027s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I\u0027ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they\u0027re definitely allowed. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea if we parade what we\u0027re doing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry drily, \u0027especially as it\u0027s not exactly a homework group you\u0027re planning, is it?\u0027\\n\\n The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 he grunted.\\n\\n \u0027Three Butterbeers, please,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.\\n\\n \u0027Six Sickles,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll get them,\u0027 said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman\u0027s eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry\u0027s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.\\n\\n \u0027You know what?\u0027 Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. \u0027We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn\u0027t care. I\u0027ve always wanted to try Firewhisky--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You--are--a--prefect,\u0027 snarled Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \u0027Yeah ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\u0027 Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.\\n\\n \u0027Just a couple of people,\u0027 Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. \u0027I told them to be here about now and I\u0027m sure they all know where it is--oh, look, this might be them now.\u0027\\n\\n The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\\n\\n First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry\u0027s stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko\u0027s merchandise.\\n\\n \u0027A couple of people?\u0027 said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \u0027A couple of people?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\u0027 said Hermione happily. \u0027Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?\u0027\\n\\n The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\\n\\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, \u0027could we have ... twenty-five Butterbeers, please?\u0027\\n\\n The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\\n\\n \u0027Cheers,\u0027 said Fred, handing them out. \u0027Cough up, everyone, I haven\u0027t got enough gold for all of these ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027What have you been telling people?\u0027 he said in a low voice. \u0027What are they expecting?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you, they just want to hear what you\u0027ve got to say,\u0027 said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, \u0027you don\u0027t have to do anything yet, I\u0027ll speak to them first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Harry,\u0027 said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\\n\\n Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron\u0027s right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\\n\\n In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \u0027Well--er--hi.\u0027\\n\\n The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Well ... erm ... well, you know why you\u0027re here. Erm ... well, Harry here had the idea--I mean\u0027 (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) \u0027I had the idea--that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts--and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us-- \u0027(Hermione\u0027s voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) \u0027-- because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts--\u0027 (\u0027Hear, hear,\u0027 said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) \u0027--Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.\u0027\\n\\n She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, \u0027And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?\u0027 said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely.\\n\\n \u0027Of course I do,\u0027 said Hermione at once. \u0027But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because ... because ...\u0027 she took a great breath and finished, \u0027because Lord Voldemort is back.\u0027\\n\\n The reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho\u0027s friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Well ... that\u0027s the plan, anyway,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027If you want to join us, we need to decide how we\u0027re going to--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s the proof You-Know-Who\u0027s back?\u0027 said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Dumbledore believes it--\u0027 Hermione began.\\n\\n \u0027You mean, Dumbledore believes him,\u0027 said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 said Ron, rather rudely.\\n\\n \u0027Zacharias Smith,\u0027 said the boy, \u0027and I think we\u0027ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who\u0027s back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 said Hermione, intervening swiftly, \u0027that\u0027s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s OK, Hermione,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people--maybe even most of them--had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry\u0027s story firsthand.\\n\\n \u0027What makes me say You-Know-Who\u0027s back?\u0027 he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face. \u0027I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn\u0027t believe him, you won\u0027t believe me, and I\u0027m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.\u0027\\n\\n The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.\\n\\n Zacharias said dismissively, \u0027All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory\u0027s body back to Hogwarts. He didn\u0027t give us details, he didn\u0027t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we\u0027d all like to know--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can\u0027t help you,\u0027 Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith\u0027s aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho. \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that\u0027s what you\u0027re here for, you might as well clear out.\u0027\\n\\n He cast an angry look in Hermione\u0027s direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. \u0027So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we\u0027re going to do it, how often we\u0027re going to meet and where we\u0027re going to--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it true,\u0027 interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, \u0027that you can produce a Patronus?\u0027\\n\\n There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry slightly defensively.\\n\\n \u0027A corporeal Patronus?\u0027\\n\\n The phrase stirred something in Harry\u0027s memory.\\n\\n \u0027Er--you don\u0027t know Madam Bones, do you?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n The girl smiled.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s my auntie,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So--is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Blimey, Harry!\u0027 said Lee, looking deeply impressed. \u0027I never knew that!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mum told Ron not to spread it around,\u0027 said Fred, grinning at Harry. \u0027She said you got enough attention as it was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s not wrong,\u0027 mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.\\n\\n The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.\\n\\n \u0027And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore\u0027s office?\u0027 demanded Terry Boot. \u0027That\u0027s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er--yeah, I did, yeah,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said \u0027Wow!\u0027 softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.\\n\\n \u0027And in our first year,\u0027 said Neville to the group at large, \u0027he saved that Philological Stone-- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Philosopher\u0027s,\u0027 hissed Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that--from You-Know-Who,\u0027 finished Neville.\\n\\n Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons.\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s not to mention,\u0027 said Cho (Harry\u0027s eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) \u0027all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year--getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things ...\u0027\\n\\n There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry\u0027s insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, and everyone fell silent at once, \u0027I ... I don\u0027t want to sound like I\u0027m trying to be modest or anything, but ... I had a lot of help with all that stuff ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not with the dragon, you didn\u0027t,\u0027 said Michael Corner at once. \u0027That was a seriously cool bit of flying ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well--\u0027 said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.\\n\\n \u0027And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,\u0027 said Susan Bones.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I\u0027m trying to make is--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?\u0027 said Zacharias Smith.\\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s an idea,\u0027 said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, \u0027why don\u0027t you shut your mouth?\u0027\\n\\n Perhaps the word \u0027weasel\u0027 had affected Ron particularly strongly. In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we\u0027ve all turned up to learn from him and now he\u0027s telling us he can\u0027t really do any of it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not what he said,\u0027 snarled Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?\u0027 enquired Greorge, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko\u0027s bags.\\n\\n \u0027Or any part of your body, really, we\u0027re not fussy where we stick this,\u0027 said Fred.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, well,\u0027 said Hermione hastily, moving on ...\u0027the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?\u0027\\n\\n There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. \u0027Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don\u0027t think there\u0027s any point in meeting less than once a week--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hang on,\u0027 said Angelina, \u0027we need to make sure this doesn\u0027t clash with our Quidditch practice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Cho, \u0027nor with ours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nor ours,\u0027 added Zacharias Smith.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,\u0027 said Hermione, slightly impatiently, \u0027but you know, this is rather important, we\u0027re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort\u0027s Death Eaters--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well said!\u0027 barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. \u0027Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we\u0027ll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up!\u0027\\n\\n He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry \u0027Surely not!\u0027 When nobody spoke, he went on, \u0027I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We think the reason Umbridge doesn\u0027t want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027is that she\u0027s got some ... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he\u0027d mobilise us against the Ministry.\u0027\\n\\n Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, \u0027Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, he\u0027s got an army of Heliopaths,\u0027 said Luna solemnly.\\n\\n \u0027No, he hasn\u0027t,\u0027 snapped Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, he has,\u0027 said Luna.\\n\\n \u0027What are Heliopaths?\u0027 asked Neville, looking blank.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re spirits of fire,\u0027 said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, \u0027great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They don\u0027t exist, Neville,\u0027 said Hermione tartly.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, they do!\u0027 said Luna angrily.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but where\u0027s the proof of that?\u0027 snapped Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027There are plenty of eye-witness accounts. Just because you\u0027re so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hem, hem,\u0027 said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. \u0027Weren\u0027t we trying to decide how often we\u0027re going to meet and have defence lessons?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hermione at once, \u0027yes, we were, you\u0027re right, Ginny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, once a week sounds cool,\u0027 said Lee Jordan.\\n\\n \u0027As long as--\u0027 began Angelina.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,\u0027 said Hermione in a tense voice. \u0027Well, the other thing to decide is where we\u0027re going to meet ...\u0027\\n\\n This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.\\n\\n \u0027Library?\u0027 suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe an unused classroom?\u0027 said Dean.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard.\u0027\\n\\n But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.\\n\\n \u0027Right, well, we\u0027ll try to find somewhere,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027We\u0027ll send a message round to everybody when we\u0027ve got a time and a place for the first meeting.\u0027\\n\\n She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.\\n\\n \u0027I--I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,\u0027 she took a deep breath, \u0027that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we\u0027re doing. So if you sign, you\u0027re agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we\u0027re up to.\u0027\\n\\n Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.\\n\\n \u0027Er ...\u0027 said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, \u0027well ... I\u0027m sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.\u0027\\n\\n But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.\\n\\n \u0027I--well, we are prefects,\u0027 Ernie burst out. \u0027And if this list was found ... well, I mean to say ... you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You just said this group was the most important thing you\u0027d do this year,\u0027 Harry reminded him.\\n\\n \u0027I--yes,\u0027 said Ernie, \u0027yes, I do believe that, it\u0027s just--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ernie, do you really think I\u0027d leave that list lying around?\u0027 said Hermione testily.\\n\\n \u0027No. No, of course not,\u0027 said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. \u0027I--yes, of course I\u0027ll sign.\u0027\\n\\n Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho\u0027s friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person--Zacharias-- had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.\\n\\n \u0027Well, time\u0027s ticking on,\u0027 said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. \u0027George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we\u0027ll be seeing you all later.\u0027\\n\\n In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too.\\n\\n Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think that went quite well,\u0027 said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog\u0027s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer.\\n\\n \u0027That Zacharias bloke\u0027s a wart,\u0027 said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like him much, either,\u0027 admitted Hermione, \u0027but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really--I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn\u0027t have come if he hadn\u0027t been going out with Ginny--\u0027\\n\\n Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s WHAT?\u0027 spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. \u0027She\u0027s going out with--my sister\u0027s going--what d\u0027you mean, Michael Corner?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s why he and his friends came, I think--well, they\u0027re obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn\u0027t told Michael what was going on--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When did this-- when did she--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,\u0027 said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft\u0027s Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window. \u0027Hmm ... I could do with a new quill.\u0027\\n\\n She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.\\n\\n \u0027Which one was Michael Corner?\u0027 Ron demanded furiously.\\n\\n \u0027The dark one,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t like him,\u0027 said Ron at once.\\n\\n \u0027Big surprise,\u0027 said Hermione under her breath.\\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, \u0027I thought Ginny fancied Harry!\u0027\\n\\n Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn\u0027t like you, of course,\u0027 she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill.\\n\\n Harry, whose head was still full of Cho\u0027s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered.\\n\\n \u0027So that\u0027s why she talks now?\u0027 he asked Hermione. \u0027She never used to talk in front of me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Yes, I think I\u0027ll have this one ...\u0027\\n\\n She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still breathing down her neck.\\n\\n \u0027Ron,\u0027 she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, \u0027this is exactly why Ginny hasn\u0027t told you she\u0027s seeing Michael, she knew you\u0027d take it badly. So don\u0027t harp on about it, for heaven\u0027s sake.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean? Who\u0027s taking anything badly? I\u0027m not going to harp on about anything ...\u0027 Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street.\\n\\n Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, \u0027And talking about Michael and Ginny ... what about Cho and you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 said Harry quickly.\\n\\n It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold--had he been that obvious?\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Hermione, smiling slightly, \u0027she just couldn\u0027t keep her eyes off you, could she?\u0027\\n\\n Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-16.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
