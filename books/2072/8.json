{"id":111675,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had been here before. This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore\u0027s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.\n The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.\n A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.\n \u0027You\u0027re late.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Harry nervously. \u0027I--I didn\u0027t know the time had been changed.\u0027\n \u0027That is not the Wizengamot\u0027s fault,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027An owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.\u0027\n Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly, but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick, he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.\n There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver \u0027W\u0027 on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.\n In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudges right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Fudge. \u0027The accused being present--finally--let us begin. Are you ready?\u0027 he called down the row.\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron\u0027s brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy\u0027s eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.\n \u0027Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\u0027 said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \u0027into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.\n \u0027Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley--\u0027\n \u0027--Witness for the defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\u0027 said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.\n Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.\n The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome.\n A powerful emotion had risen in Harry\u0027s chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore\u0027s eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. \u0027Dumbledore. Yes. You--er--got our--er-- message that the time and--er--place of the hearing had been changed, then?\u0027\n \u0027I must have missed it,\u0027 said Dumbledore cheerfully. \u0027However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.\u0027\n \u0027Yes--well--I suppose we\u0027ll need another chair--I--Weasley, could you--?\u0027\n \u0027Not to worry, not to worry,\u0027 said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. \u0027Well, then. So. The charges. Yes.\u0027\n He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read out, \u0027The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on the second of August at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offence under Paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks\u0027 Statute of Secrecy.\n \u0027You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?\u0027 Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry said.\n \u0027You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but--\u0027\n \u0027And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?\u0027 said Fudge.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but--\u0027\n \u0027Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but--\u0027\n \u0027Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but--\u0027\n \u0027Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry angrily, \u0027but I only used it because we were--\u0027\n The witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice.\n \u0027You produced a fully-fledged Patronus?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027because--\u0027\n \u0027A corporeal Patronus?\u0027\n \u0027A--what?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than vapour or smoke?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, \u0027it\u0027s a stag, it\u0027s always a stag.\u0027\n \u0027Always?\u0027 boomed Madam Bones. \u0027You have produced a Patronus before now?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027I\u0027ve been doing it for over a year.\u0027\n \u0027And you are fifteen years old?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, and--\u0027\n \u0027You learned this at school?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the--\u0027\n \u0027Impressive,\u0027 said Madam Bones, staring down at him, \u0027a true Patronus at his age ... very impressive indeed.\u0027\n Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.\n \u0027It\u0027s not a question of how impressive the magic was,\u0027 said Fudge in a testy voice, \u0027in fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!\u0027\n Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy\u0027s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.\n \u0027I did it because of the dementors!\u0027 he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again.\n He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before.\n \u0027Dementors?\u0027 said Madam Bones after a moment, her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out. \u0027What do you mean, boy?\u0027\n \u0027I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. \u0027Yes. Yes, I thought we\u0027d be hearing something like this.\u0027\n \u0027Dementors in Little Whinging?\u0027 Madam Bones said, in a tone of great surprise. \u0027I don\u0027t understand--\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you, Amelia?\u0027 said Fudge, still smirking. \u0027Let me explain. He\u0027s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can\u0027t see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient ... so it\u0027s just your word and no witnesses....\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not lying!\u0027 said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. \u0027There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it--\u0027\n \u0027Enough, enough!\u0027 said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face. \u0027I\u0027m sorry to interrupt what I\u0027m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story--\u0027\n Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.\n \u0027We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,\u0027 he said, \u0027other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.\u0027\n Fudge\u0027s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, \u0027We haven\u0027t got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I\u0027m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly--\u0027\n \u0027I may be wrong,\u0027 said Dumbledore pleasantly, \u0027but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn\u0027t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?\u0027 he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.\n \u0027True,\u0027 said Madam Bones. \u0027Perfectly true.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, very well, very well,\u0027 snapped Fudge. \u0027Where is this person?\u0027\n \u0027I brought her with me,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027She\u0027s just outside the door. Should I--?\u0027\n \u0027No--Weasley, you go,\u0027 Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge\u0027s balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.\n A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.\n Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.\n \u0027Full name?\u0027 said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.\n \u0027Arabella Doreen Figg,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.\n \u0027And who exactly are you?\u0027 said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.\n \u0027I\u0027m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg.\n \u0027We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,\u0027 said Madam Bones at once. \u0027That situation has always been closely monitored, given ... given past events.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m a Squib,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg. \u0027So you wouldn\u0027t have me registered, would you?\u0027\n \u0027A Squib, eh?\u0027 said Fudge, eyeing her closely. \u0027We\u0027ll be checking that. You\u0027ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?\u0027 he added, looking left and right along the bench.\n \u0027Yes, we can!\u0027 said Mrs. Figg indignantly.\n Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said aloofly. \u0027What is your story?\u0027\n \u0027I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o\u0027clock, on the evening of the second of August,\u0027 gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, \u0027when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running--\u0027\n \u0027Running?\u0027 said Madam Bones sharply. \u0027Dementors don\u0027t run, they glide.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what I meant to say,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. \u0027Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys.\u0027\n \u0027What did they look like?\u0027 said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh.\n \u0027Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny--\u0027\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 said Madam Bones impatiently. \u0027The dementors ... describe them.\u0027\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. \u0027They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\u0027\n Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air....\n In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded.\n \u0027Big and wearing cloaks,\u0027 repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. \u0027I see. Anything else?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mrs Figg. \u0027I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer\u0027s night, mark you. And I felt ... as though all happiness had gone from the world ... and I remembered ... dreadful things....\u0027\n Her voice shook and died.\n Madam Bones\u0027s eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.\n \u0027What did the dementors do?\u0027 she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.\n \u0027They went for the boys,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. \u0027One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that ... that is what happened,\u0027 Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.\n Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, \u0027That\u0027s what you saw, is it?\u0027\n \u0027That is what happened,\u0027 Mrs. Figg repeated.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Fudge. \u0027You may go.\u0027\n Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.\n \u0027Not a very convincing witness,\u0027 said Fudge loftily.\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. \u0027She certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I can\u0027t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?\u0027 snorted Fudge. The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn\u0027t have bet--\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence,\u0027 said Dumbledore lightly.\n The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shadow, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent.\n \u0027And what is that supposed to mean?\u0027 Fudge asked icily.\n \u0027It means that I think they were ordered there,\u0027 said Dumbledore.\n \u0027I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!\u0027 barked Fudge.\n \u0027Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,\u0027 said Dumbledore calmly. \u0027I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, you have,\u0027 said Fudge forcefully, \u0027and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.\u0027\n \u0027Then,\u0027 said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, \u0027we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.\u0027\n In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time.\n He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.\n \u0027The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,\u0027 said Fudge.\n The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.\n \u0027I\u0027m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,\u0027 she said, with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. \u0027So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!\u0027\n She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry\u0027s neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.\n \u0027If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,\u0027 said Dumbledore politely. \u0027Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control--\u0027\n \u0027There are no dementors outside Ministry control!\u0027 snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red.\n Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.\n \u0027Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation.\u0027\n \u0027It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!\u0027 snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.\n \u0027Of course it isn\u0027t,\u0027 said Dumbledore mildly. \u0027I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.\u0027\n He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly.\n \u0027I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy\u0027s imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!\u0027 said Fudge. \u0027We are here to examine Harry Potter\u0027s offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!\u0027\n \u0027Of course we are,\u0027 said Dumbledore, \u0027but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time of the--\u0027\n \u0027We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much!\u0027 snarled Fudge.\n \u0027Of course you are,\u0027 said Dumbledore courteously. \u0027Then we are in agreement that Harry\u0027s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes?\u0027\n \u0027If there were dementors, which I doubt.\u0027\n \u0027You have heard it from an eyewitness,\u0027 Dumbledore interrupted.\n \u0027If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object.\u0027\n \u0027I--that--not--\u0027 blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. \u0027It\u0027s--I want this over with today, Dumbledore!\u0027\n \u0027But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,\u0027 said Dumbledore.\n \u0027Serious miscarriage, my hat!\u0027 said Fudge at the top of his voice. \u0027Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you\u0027ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago--\u0027\n \u0027That wasn\u0027t me, it was a house-elf!\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027YOU SEE?\u0027 roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry\u0027s direction. \u0027A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you--\u0027\n \u0027The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\u0027\n \u0027I--not--I haven\u0027t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that\u0027s not the only--he blew up his aunt, for God\u0027s sake!\u0027 Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge\u0027s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.\n \u0027And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\u0027 said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.\n \u0027And I haven\u0027t even started on what he gets up to at school--\u0027\n \u0027But, as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school, Harry\u0027s behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing,\u0027 said Dumbledore, as politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.\n \u0027Oho!\u0027 said Fudge. \u0027Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\u0027\n \u0027The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August, in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.\u0027\n \u0027Laws can be changed,\u0027 said Fudge savagely.\n \u0027Of course they can,\u0027 said Dumbledore, inclining his head. \u0027And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!\u0027\n A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.\n \u0027As far as I am aware,\u0027 Dumbledore continued, \u0027there is no law yet in place that says this court\u0027s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.\u0027\n Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry\u0027s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.\n Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed....\n Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes.\n Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.\n \u0027Those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges?\u0027 said Madam Boness booming voice.\n Harry\u0027s head jerked upwards. There were hands in the air, many of them ... more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish, Madam Bones had said, \u0027And those in favour of conviction?\u0027\n Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily-moustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row.\n Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, \u0027Very well, very well ... cleared of all charges.\u0027\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feel, pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. \u0027Well, I must be getting along. Good day to you all.\u0027\n And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-8.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
