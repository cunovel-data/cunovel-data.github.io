{"id":111674,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered. Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher\u0027s ancestors, and down into the kitchen. He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered. \u0027Breakfast,\u0027 she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire. \u0027M-m-morning, Harry,\u0027 yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \u0027Sleep all right?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I\u0027ve b-b-been up all night,\u0027 she said, with another shuddering yawn. \u0027Come and sit down....\u0027 She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. \u0027What do you want, Harry?\u0027 Mrs. Weasley called. \u0027Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\u0027 \u0027Just--just toast, thanks,\u0027 said Harry. Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \u0027What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\u0027 \u0027Oh ... yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he\u0027s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions....\u0027 Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn\u0027t. \u0027...and I\u0027ll have to tell Dumbledore I can\u0027t do night duty tomorrow, I\u0027m just t-t-too tired,\u0027 Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. \u0027I\u0027ll cover for you,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley. \u0027I\u0027m OK, I\u0027ve got a report to finish anyway....\u0027 Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizards\u0027 robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry. \u0027How are you feeling?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027It\u0027ll all be over soon,\u0027 Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \u0027In a few hours\u0027 time you\u0027ll be cleared.\u0027 Harry said nothing. \u0027The hearing\u0027s on my floor, in Amelia Bones\u0027s office. She\u0027s Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she\u0027s the one who\u0027ll be questioning you.\u0027 \u0027Amelia Bones is OK, Harry,\u0027 said Tonks earnestly. \u0027She\u0027s fair, she\u0027ll hear you out.\u0027 Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. \u0027Don\u0027t lose your temper,\u0027 said Sirius abruptly. \u0027Be polite and stick to the facts.\u0027 Harry nodded again. \u0027The law\u0027s on your side,\u0027 said Lupin quietly. \u0027Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\u0027 Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry\u0027s neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him, then he realised that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. \u0027Doesn\u0027t it ever lie flat?\u0027 she said desperately. Harry shook his head. \u0027Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. I think we\u0027ll go now,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re a bit early, but I think you\u0027ll be better off at the Ministry than hanging around here.\u0027 \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet. \u0027You\u0027ll be all right, Harry,\u0027 said Tonks, patting him on the arm. \u0027Good luck,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027I\u0027m sure it will be fine.\u0027 \u0027And if it\u0027s not,\u0027 said Sirius grimly, \u0027I\u0027ll see to Amelia Bones for you....\u0027 Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. \u0027We\u0027ve all got our fingers crossed,\u0027 she said. \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Well ... see you later then.\u0027 He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius\u0027s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, grey dawn. \u0027You don\u0027t normally walk to work, do you?\u0027 Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. \u0027No, I usually Apparate,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, \u0027but obviously you can\u0027t, and I think it\u0027s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion ... makes a better impression, given what you\u0027re being disciplined for....\u0027 Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of early-morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. \u0027Simply fabulous,\u0027 he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \u0027Wonderfully ingenious.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re out of order,\u0027 said Harry, pointing at the sign. \u0027Yes, but even so...\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, beaming at them fondly. They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows. \u0027Four stops, Harry ... three stops left now ... two stops to go, Harry...\u0027 They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic. \u0027Where are we?\u0027 said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley\u0027s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \u0027Ah yes ... this way, Harry,\u0027 and led him down a side road. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact, I\u0027ve never even used the visitors\u0027 entrance before.\u0027 The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. \u0027Here we are,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall. \u0027After you, Harry.\u0027 He opened the telephone-box door. Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \u0027Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order, too,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027No, no, I\u0027m sure its fine,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \u0027Let\u0027s see ... six...\u0027 he dialled the number, \u0027two ... four ... and another four ... and another two...\u0027 As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley\u0027s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \u0027Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\u0027 \u0027Er...\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver. He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \u0027Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing....\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said the cool female voice. \u0027Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\u0027 There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. \u0027Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium \u0027 The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering. \u0027The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\u0027 said the woman\u0027s voice. The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard. The wall\u0027s on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur\u0027s arrow, the tip of the goblin\u0027s hat, and each of the house-elf\u0027s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \u0027This way,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley. They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others were reading the Daily Prophet while they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to St. Mungo\u0027s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I\u0027m not expelled from Hogwarts, I\u0027ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. \u0027Over here, Harry,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates. Seated at a desk to the left, beneath a sign saying SECURITY, a badly-shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. \u0027I\u0027m escorting a visitor,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, gesturing towards Harry. \u0027Step over here,\u0027 said the wizard in a bored voice. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry\u0027s front and back. \u0027Wand,\u0027 grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand. Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing on it. \u0027Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry nervously. \u0027I keep this,\u0027 said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \u0027You get this back,\u0027 he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. \u0027Thank you.\u0027 \u0027Hang on....\u0027 said the wizard slowly. His eyes had darted from the silver visitor\u0027s badge on Harry\u0027s chest to his forehead. \u0027Thank you, Eric,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. Nearby, stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises. \u0027All right, Arthur?\u0027 said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. \u0027What\u0027ve you got there, Bob?\u0027 asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box. \u0027We\u0027re not sure,\u0027 said the wizard seriously. \u0027We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\u0027 With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone\u0027s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. \u0027Level Seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office.\u0027 The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls. One of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman\u0027s voice announced: \u0027Level Six, Department of Magical Transportation, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Centre.\u0027 Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet colour and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edge of their wings. \u0027Just inter-departmental memos,\u0027 Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \u0027We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable ... droppings all over the desks...\u0027 As they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the lift\u0027s ceiling. \u0027Level Five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\u0027 When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it. \u0027Level Four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau. \u0027 \u0027S\u0027cuse,\u0027 said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. \u0027Level Three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\u0027 Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again, then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement. \u0027Level Two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\u0027 \u0027This is us, Harry,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \u0027My office is on the other side of the floor.\u0027 \u0027Mr. Weasley,\u0027 said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \u0027aren\u0027t we still underground?\u0027 \u0027Yes, we are,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley. \u0027Those are enchanted windows. Magical Maintenance decide what weather we\u0027ll get every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise.... Just round here, Harry.\u0027 They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything From pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favourite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill\u0027s was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little further along, a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \u0027Morning, Weasley,\u0027 said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \u0027I\u0027ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\u0027 \u0027Yes, if it really is a second,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, \u0027I\u0027m in rather a hurry.\u0027 They were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasly stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; blinking down at him from every direction was Sirius\u0027s face. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs--even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters\u0027 wedding--papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \u0027Here,\u0027 said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand. \u0027I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We\u0027ve received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\u0027 Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \u0027Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\u0027 Then he said in normal tones, \u0027And don\u0027t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\u0027 \u0027If you had read my report you would know that the term is \"firearms\",\u0027 said Mr. Weasley coolly. \u0027And I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we\u0027re extremely busy at the moment.\u0027 He dropped his voice and said, \u0027If you can get away before seven, Molly\u0027s making meatballs.\u0027 He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley\u0027s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading Misuse of Muggle Artefacts. Mr. Weasley\u0027s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley\u0027s obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children\u0027s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley\u0027s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it. \u0027We haven\u0027t got a window,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \u0027We\u0027ve asked, but they don\u0027t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn\u0027t look as if Perkins is in yet.\u0027 Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins\u0027s desk while Mr. Weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him. \u0027Ah,\u0027 he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \u0027yes...\u0027 He flicked through it. \u0027Yes, he\u0027s right, I\u0027m sure Sirius will find that very amusing--oh dear, what\u0027s this now?\u0027 A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \u0027\"Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.\" This is getting ridiculous ...\u0027 \u0027A regurgitating toilet?\u0027 \u0027Anti-Muggle pranksters,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \u0027We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing--well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those--pumbles, I think they\u0027re called--you know, the ones who mend pipes and things.\u0027 \u0027Plumbers?\u0027 \u0027--exactly, yes, but of course they\u0027re flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever\u0027s doing it.\u0027 \u0027Will it be Aurors who catch them?\u0027 \u0027Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it\u0027ll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol--ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\u0027 A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting. \u0027Oh, Arthur!\u0027 he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \u0027Thank goodness, I didn\u0027t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not. I\u0027ve just sent an owl to your home but you\u0027ve obviously missed it--an urgent message came ten minutes ago--\u0027 \u0027I know about the regurgitating toilet,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley. \u0027No, no, it\u0027s not the toilet, it\u0027s the Potter boy\u0027s hearing--they\u0027ve changed the time and venue--it starts at eight o\u0027clock now and it\u0027s down in old Courtroom Ten--\u0027 \u0027Down in old-- but they told me--Merlin\u0027s beard--\u0027 Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp and leapt from his chair. \u0027Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\u0027 Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry close on his heels. \u0027Why have they changed the time?\u0027 Harry said breathlessly, as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins\u0027s desk. \u0027I\u0027ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you\u0027d missed it, it would have been catastrophic!\u0027 Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the \u0027down\u0027 button. \u0027Come ON!\u0027 The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button. \u0027Those courtrooms haven\u0027t been used in years,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley angrily. \u0027I can\u0027t think why they\u0027re doing it down there--unless--but no...\u0027 A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. \u0027The Atrium,\u0027 said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in. \u0027Morning, Arthur,\u0027 he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \u0027Don\u0027t often see you down here....\u0027 \u0027Urgent business, Bode,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. \u0027Ah, yes,\u0027 said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \u0027Of course.\u0027 Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. \u0027Department of Mysteries,\u0027 said the cool female voice, and left it at that. \u0027Quick, Harry,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps. \u0027Down here, down here,\u0027 panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \u0027The lift doesn\u0027t even come down this far ... why they\u0027re doing it down there...\u0027 They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to Snape\u0027s dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes. \u0027Courtroom ... ten ... I think ... we\u0027re nearly ... yes.\u0027 Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. \u0027Go on,\u0027 he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \u0027Get in there.\u0027 \u0027Aren\u0027t--aren\u0027t you coming with--?\u0027 \u0027No, no, I\u0027m not allowed. Good luck!\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam\u0027s apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-7.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
