{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
