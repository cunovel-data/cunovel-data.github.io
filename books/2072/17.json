{"id":111684,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves.\n Knowing they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ... and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done ... and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament--knowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes.\n He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing Angelina\u0027s idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that nights Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.\n A large sign had been affixed to the Grffindor noticeboard, so large it covered everything else on it--the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog Cards for others, the Weasleys\u0027 latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.\n BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS\n All student organisations, societies, teams, groups and clubs are\n henceforth disbanded.\n An organisation, society, team, group or club is hereby defined\n as a regular meeting of three or more students.\n Permission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor\n (Professor Umbridge).\n No student organisation, society, team, group or club may exist\n without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor.\n Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an organisation,\n society, team, group or club that has not been approved by\n the High Inquisitor will be expelled.\n The above is in accordance with Educational Decree\n Number Twenty-four.\n Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor\n Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second-years.\n \u0027Does this mean they\u0027re going to shut down the Gobstones Club?\u0027 one of them asked his friend.\n \u0027I reckon you\u0027ll be OK with Gobstones,\u0027 Ron said darkly, making the second-year jump. \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to be as lucky, though, do you?\u0027 he asked Harry as the second-years hurried away.\n Harry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with rage.\n \u0027This isn\u0027t a coincidence,\u0027 he said, his hands forming fists. \u0027She knows.\u0027\n \u0027She can\u0027t,\u0027 said Ron at once.\n \u0027There were people listening in that pub. And let\u0027s face it, we don\u0027t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust ... any of them could have run off and told Umbridge ...\u0027\n And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him ...\n \u0027Zacharias Smith!\u0027 said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand. \u0027Or--I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look, too--\u0027\n \u0027I wonder if Hermione\u0027s seen this yet?\u0027 Harry said, looking round at the door to the girls\u0027 dormitories.\n \u0027Let\u0027s go and tell her,\u0027 said Ron. He bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase.\n He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide like a helter-skelter. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry\u0027s feet.\n \u0027Er--I don\u0027t think we\u0027re allowed in the girls\u0027 dormitories,\u0027 said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.\n Two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.\n \u0027Oooh. who tried to get upstairs?\u0027 they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.\n \u0027Me,\u0027 said Ron, who was still rather dishevelled. \u0027I didn\u0027t realise that would happen. It\u0027s not fair!\u0027 he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. \u0027Hermione\u0027s allowed in our dormitory, how come we\u0027re not allowed --?\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s an old-fashioned rule,\u0027 said Hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, \u0027but it says in Hogwarts: A History, that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?\u0027\n \u0027To see you--look at this!\u0027 said Ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard.\n Hermione\u0027s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression became stony.\n \u0027Someone must have blabbed to her!\u0027 Ron said angrily.\n \u0027They can\u0027t have done,\u0027 said Hermione in a low voice.\n \u0027You\u0027re so naive,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027you think just because you\u0027re all honourable and trustworthy --\u0027\n \u0027No, they can\u0027t have done, because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,\u0027 said Hermione grimly. \u0027Believe me, if anyone\u0027s run off and told Umbridge, we\u0027ll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027ll happen to them?\u0027 said Ron eagerly.\n \u0027Well, put it this way,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027it\u0027ll make Eloise Midgeon\u0027s acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let\u0027s get down to breakfast and see what the others think ... I wonder whether this has been put up in all the houses?\u0027\n It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge\u0027s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read. Harry, Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George and Ginny descended upon them.\n \u0027Did you see it?\u0027\n \u0027D\u0027you reckon she knows?\u0027\n \u0027What are we going to do?\u0027\n They were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them.\n \u0027We\u0027re going to do it anyway, of course,\u0027 he said quietly.\n \u0027Knew you\u0027d say that,\u0027 said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm.\n \u0027The prefects as well?\u0027 said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Hermione coolly.\n \u0027Here come Ernie and Hannah Abbott,\u0027 said Ron, looking over his shoulder. \u0027And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith ... and no one looks very spotty.\u0027\n Hermione looked alarmed.\n \u0027Never mind spots, the idiots can\u0027t come over here now, it\u0027ll look really suspicious--sit down!\u0027 she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. \u0027Later! We\u0027ll--talk--to--you--later!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell Michael,\u0027 said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, \u0027the fool, honestly ...\u0027\n She hurried off towards the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go. Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the Hog\u0027s Head. Would Umbridge\u0027s notice scare her off meeting them again?\n But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.\n \u0027Harry! Ron!\u0027\n It was Angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate.\n \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him. \u0027We\u0027re still going to--\u0027\n \u0027You realise she\u0027s including Quidditch in this?\u0027 Angelina said over him. \u0027We have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027No way,\u0027 said Ron, appalled.\n \u0027You read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry ... I am saying this for the last time ... please, please don\u0027t lose your temper with Umbridge again or she might not let us play any more!\u0027\n \u0027OK, OK,\u0027 said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll behave myself ...\u0027\n \u0027Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic,\u0027 said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns\u0027s lesson. \u0027She hasn\u0027t inspected Binns yet ... bet you anything she\u0027s there ...\u0027\n But he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione\u0027s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n She pointed at the window. Harry looked round. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn\u0027t she delivered the letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other, too.\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027ve always loved that owl, she\u0027s so beautiful,\u0027 Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.\n He glanced round at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class\u0027s attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly.\n He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.\n Only then did he realise that Hedwig\u0027s feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.\n \u0027She\u0027s hurt!\u0027 Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill. \u0027Look--there\u0027s something wrong with her wing--\u0027\n Hedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.\n \u0027Professor Binns,\u0027 said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. \u0027I\u0027m not feeling well.\u0027\n Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people.\n \u0027Not feeling well?\u0027 he repeated hazily.\n \u0027Not at all well,\u0027 said Harry firmly, getting to his feet with Hedwig concealed behind his back. \u0027I think I need to go to the hospital wing.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. \u0027Yes ... yes, hospital wing ... well, off you go, then, Perkins ...\u0027\n Once outside the room, Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns\u0027s door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.\n He peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid\u0027s cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staff room. He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.\n Two stone gargoyles flanked the staff-room door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked, \u0027You should be in class, Sonny Jim.\u0027\n \u0027This is urgent,\u0027 said Harry curtly.\n \u0027Ooooh, urgent, is it?\u0027 said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice. \u0027Well, that\u0027s put us in our place, hasn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Harry knocked. He heard footsteps, then the door opened and he found himself face to face with Professor McGonagall.\n \u0027You haven\u0027t been given another detention!\u0027 she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly.\n \u0027No, Professor!\u0027 said Harry hastily.\n \u0027Well then, why are you out of class?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s urgent, apparently,\u0027 said the second gargoyle snidely.\n \u0027I\u0027m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,\u0027 Harry explained. \u0027It\u0027s my owl, she\u0027s injured.\u0027\n \u0027Injured owl, did you say?\u0027\n Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall\u0027s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, \u0027she turned up after the other post owls and her wing\u0027s all funny, look--\u0027\n Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked. \u0027Looks like something\u0027s attacked her. Can\u0027t think what would have done it, though. Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid\u0027s got the Hogwarts Thestrals well-trained not to touch owls.\u0027\n Harry neither knew nor cared what Thestrals were; he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \u0027Do you know how far this owl\u0027s travelled, Potter?\u0027\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027From London, I think.\u0027\n He met her eyes briefly and knew, by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle, that she understood \u0027London\u0027 to mean \u0027number twelve, Grimmauld Place\u0027.\n Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye, to examine Hedwig\u0027s wing closely. \u0027I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,\u0027 she said, \u0027she shouldn\u0027t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.\u0027\n \u0027Er--right--thanks,\u0027 said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.\n \u0027No problem,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staff room.\n \u0027Just a moment, Wilhelmina!\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. \u0027Potter\u0027s letter!\u0027\n \u0027Oh yeah!\u0027 said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig\u0027s leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this. Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him back.\n \u0027Potter!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Professor?\u0027\n She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions.\n \u0027Bear in mind,\u0027 she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, \u0027that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027I--\u0027 said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. He spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in Sirius\u0027s handwriting:\n Today, same time, same place.\n \u0027Is Hedwig OK?\u0027 asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot.\n \u0027Where did you take her?\u0027 asked Ron.\n \u0027To Grubbly-Plank,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And I met McGonagall ... listen ...\u0027\n And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his surprise, neither of the others looked shocked. On the contrary, they exchanged significant looks.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again.\n \u0027Well, I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she\u0027s never been hurt on a flight before, has she?\u0027\n \u0027Who\u0027s the letter from, anyway?\u0027 asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.\n \u0027Snuffles,\u0027 said Harry quietly.\n \u0027\"Same time, same place?\" Does he mean the fire in the common room?\u0027\n \u0027Obviously,\u0027 said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked uneasy. \u0027I just hope nobody else has read this ...\u0027\n \u0027But it was still sealed and everything,\u0027 said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her. \u0027And nobody would understand what it meant if they didn\u0027t know where we\u0027d spoken to him before, would they?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again, \u0027it wouldn\u0027t be exactly difficult to re-seal the scroll by magic ... and if anyone\u0027s watching the Floo Network ... but I don\u0027t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted, too!\u0027\n They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them, lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape\u0027s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.\n \u0027Yeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he\u0027s always popping in and out of the Ministry ... it\u0027ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t rise,\u0027 Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. \u0027It\u0027s what he wants.\u0027\n \u0027I mean,\u0027 said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his grey eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron\u0027s direction, \u0027if it\u0027s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve got much chance ... from what my father says, they\u0027ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years ... and as for Potter ... my father says it\u0027s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo\u0027s ... apparently they\u0027ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.\u0027\n Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter; Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.\n Something collided hard with Harry\u0027s shoulder, knocking him sideways. A split second later he realised that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.\n \u0027Neville, no!\u0027\n Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville\u0027s robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.\n \u0027Help me!\u0027 Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville\u0027s neck and dragging him backwards, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron seized Neville\u0027s arms, and together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Nevilles face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.\n \u0027Not ... funny ... don\u0027t ... Mungo\u0027s ... show ... him ...\u0027\n The dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.\n \u0027Fighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?\u0027 Snape said in his cold, sneering voice. \u0027Ten points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.\u0027\n Harry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him.\n \u0027I had to stop you,\u0027 Harry gasped, picking up his bag. \u0027Crabbe and Goyle would\u0027ve torn you apart.\u0027\n Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.\n \u0027What in the name of Merlin,\u0027 said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, \u0027was that about?\u0027\n Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungo\u0027s because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville\u0027s secret. Even Neville did not know Harry knew.\n Harry, Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment, quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent.\n \u0027You will notice,\u0027 said Snape, in his low, sneering voice, \u0027that we have a guest with us today.\u0027\n He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most. It was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other.\n \u0027We are continuing with our Strengthening Solution today. You will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson; it correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend--instructions--\u0027 he waved his wand again \u0027--on the board. Carry on.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her question Snape; so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again.\n \u0027Salamander blood, Harry!\u0027 Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, \u0027not pomegranate juice!\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just got to her feet. \u0027Ha,\u0027 he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks towards Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas\u0027s cauldron.\n \u0027Well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,\u0027 she said briskly to Snape\u0027s back. \u0027Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.\u0027\n Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.\n \u0027Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\u0027 she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard.\n \u0027Fourteen years,\u0027 Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. Harry, watching him closely, added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.\n \u0027You applied first for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?\u0027 Professor Umbridge asked Snape.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Snape quietly.\n \u0027But you were unsuccessful?\u0027\n Snape\u0027s lip curled.\n \u0027Obviously.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.\n \u0027And you have applied regularly for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.\n \u0027Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?\u0027 asked Umbridge.\n \u0027I suggest you ask him,\u0027 said Snape jerkily.\n \u0027Oh, I shall,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile.\n \u0027I suppose this is relevant?\u0027 Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, \u0027yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers\u0027--er--backgrounds.\u0027\n She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a. strong smell of burned rubber.\n \u0027No marks again, then, Potter,\u0027 said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry\u0027s cauldron with a wave of his wand. \u0027You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end.\n \u0027Maybe I\u0027ll skive off Divination,\u0027 he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. \u0027I\u0027ll pretend to be ill and do Snape\u0027s essay instead, then I won\u0027t have to stay up half the night.\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t skive off Divination,\u0027 said Hermione severely.\n \u0027Hark who\u0027s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!\u0027 said Ron indignantly.\n \u0027I don\u0027t hate her,\u0027 said Hermione loftily. \u0027I just think she\u0027s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. But Harry\u0027s already missed History of Magic and I don\u0027t think he ought to miss anything else today!\u0027\n There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of The Dream Oracle.Harry thought he\u0027d surely be much better employed doing Snape\u0027s punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams.\n It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus\u0027s head, and thrust the final one into Neville\u0027s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe.\n \u0027Well, carry on!\u0027 said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, \u0027you know what to do! Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?\u0027\n The class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teachers chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron\u0027s and muttered, \u0027I think she\u0027s got the results of her inspection back.\u0027\n \u0027Professor?\u0027 said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). \u0027Professor, is there anything--er--wrong?\u0027\n \u0027Wrong!\u0027 cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. \u0027Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly ... insinuations have been made against me ... unfounded accusations levelled ... but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not!\u0027\n She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses.\n \u0027I say nothing,\u0027 she choked, \u0027of sixteen years of devoted service ... it has passed, apparently, unnoticed ... but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!\u0027\n \u0027But, Professor, who\u0027s insulting you?\u0027 asked Parvati timidly.\n \u0027The Establishment!\u0027 said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. \u0027Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know ... of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted ... it is--alas--our fate.\u0027\n She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry.\n Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look.\n \u0027Professor,\u0027 said Parvati, \u0027do you mean ... is it something Professor Umbridge--?\u0027\n \u0027Do not speak to me about that woman!\u0027 cried Professor Trelawney leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing. \u0027Kindly continue with your work!\u0027\n And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath.\n \u0027... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on probation ... we shall see ... how she dares ...\u0027\n \u0027You and Umbridge have got something in common,\u0027 Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts. \u0027She obviously reckons Trelawney\u0027s an old fraud, too ... looks like she\u0027s put her on probation.\u0027\n Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness.\n \u0027Good afternoon, class.\u0027\n \u0027Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\u0027 they chanted dully.\n \u0027Wands away, please.\u0027\n But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands.\n \u0027Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled \"The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack\". There will be--\u0027\n \u0027--no need to talk,\u0027 Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths.\n \u0027No Quidditch practice,\u0027 said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night.\n \u0027But I kept my temper!\u0027 said Harry, horrified. \u0027I didn\u0027t say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I--\u0027\n \u0027I know, I know, said Angelina miserably. \u0027She just said she needed a bit of time to consider.\u0027\n \u0027Consider what?\u0027 said Ron angrily. \u0027She\u0027s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?\u0027\n But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027look on the bright side--at least now you\u0027ll have time to do Snape\u0027s essay!\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s a bright side, is it?\u0027 snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. \u0027No Quidditch practice, and extra Potions?\u0027\n Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work. It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew Sirius was not due in the fire until much later, he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.\n First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily Vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry\u0027s potions.\n What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solution. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George\u0027s bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs, which Harry found, if anything, more distracting.\n \u0027Just go and stop them, then!\u0027 he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.\n \u0027I can\u0027t, they\u0027re not technically doing anything wrong,\u0027 said Hermione through gritted teeth. \u0027They\u0027re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can\u0027t find a rule that says the other idiots aren\u0027t entitled to buy them, not unless they\u0027re proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn\u0027t look as though they are.\u0027\n She, Harry and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.\n \u0027You know, I don\u0027t get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,\u0027 said Harry, watching as Fred, George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd. \u0027They really know their stuff.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, they only know flashy stuff that\u0027s of no real use to anyone,\u0027 said Hermione disparagingly.\n \u0027No real use?\u0027 said Ron in a strained voice. \u0027Hermione, they\u0027ve made about twenty-six Galleons already.\u0027\n It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins dispersed, then Fred, Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves. At long last, Fred had closed the doorway to the boys\u0027 dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire.\n \u0027Sirius!\u0027 he said.\n Harry whipped round. Sirius\u0027s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 he said, grinning.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 chorused Harry, Ron and Hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius\u0027s.\n \u0027How\u0027re things?\u0027 said Sirius.\n \u0027Not that good,\u0027 said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. \u0027The Ministry\u0027s forced through another decree, which means we\u0027re not allowed to have Quidditch teams--\u0027\n \u0027Or secret Defence Against the Dark Arts groups?\u0027 Said Sirius.\n There was a short pause.\n \u0027How did you know about that?\u0027 Harry demanded.\n \u0027You want to choose your meeting places more carefully,\u0027 said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. \u0027The Hog\u0027s Head, I ask you.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!\u0027 said Hermione defensively. \u0027That\u0027s always packed with people--\u0027\n \u0027Which means you\u0027d have been harder to overhear,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027You\u0027ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.\u0027\n \u0027Who overheard us?\u0027 Harry demanded.\n \u0027Mundungus, of course,\u0027 said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. \u0027He was the witch under the veil.\u0027\n \u0027That was Mundungus?\u0027 Harry said, stunned. \u0027What was he doing in the Hog\u0027s Head?\u0027\n \u0027What do you think he was doing?\u0027 said Sirius impatiently. \u0027Keeping an eye on you, of course.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m still being followed?\u0027 asked Harry angrily.\n \u0027Yeah, you are,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027and just as well, isn\u0027t it, if the first thing you\u0027re going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group.\u0027\n But he looked neither angry nor worried. On the contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride.\n \u0027Why was Dung hiding from us?\u0027 asked Ron, sounding disappointed. \u0027We\u0027d\u0027ve liked to\u0027ve seen him.\u0027\n \u0027He was banned from the Hog\u0027s Head twenty years ago,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027and that barman\u0027s got a long memory. We lost Moody\u0027s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung\u0027s been dressing as a witch a lot lately ... anyway ... first of all, Ron--I\u0027ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yeah?\u0027 said Ron, sounding apprehensive.\n \u0027She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group. She says you\u0027ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also\u0027 (Sirius\u0027s eyes turned to the other two) \u0027advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you\u0027d all have been in real trouble, and she can\u0027t say it for herself because she\u0027s on duty tonight.\u0027\n \u0027On duty doing what?\u0027 said Ron quickly.\n \u0027Never you mind, just stuff for the Order,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027So it\u0027s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don\u0027t think she trusts me to.\u0027\n There was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius\u0027s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug.\n \u0027So, you want me to say I\u0027m not going to take part in the Defence group?\u0027 he muttered finally.\n \u0027Me? Certainly not!\u0027 said Sirius, looking surprised. \u0027I think it\u0027s an excellent idea!\u0027\n \u0027You do?\u0027 said Harry, his heart lifting.\n \u0027Of course I do!\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027D\u0027you think your father and I would\u0027ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?\u0027\n \u0027But--last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks--\u0027\n \u0027Last year, all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!\u0027 said Sirius impatiently. \u0027This year, we know there\u0027s someone outside Hogwarts who\u0027d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!\u0027\n \u0027And if we do get expelled?\u0027 Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face.\n \u0027Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!\u0027 said Harry, staring at her.\n \u0027I know it was. I just wondered what Sirius thought,\u0027 she said, shrugging.\n \u0027Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,\u0027 said Sirius.\n \u0027Hear, hear,\u0027 said Harry and Ron enthusiastically.\n \u0027So,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027how are you organising this group? Where are you meeting?\u0027\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s a bit of a problem now,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Dunno where we\u0027re going to be able to go.\u0027\n \u0027How about the Shrieking Shack?\u0027 suggested Sirius.\n \u0027Hey, that\u0027s an idea!\u0027 said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius\u0027s head turning in the flames.\n \u0027Well, Sirius, it\u0027s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you\u0027d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn\u0027t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee--\u0027\n \u0027Fair point,\u0027 said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. \u0027Well, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll come up with somewhere. There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there.\u0027\n \u0027Fred and George told me it\u0027s blocked,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head. \u0027Caved in or something.\u0027\n \u0027Oh ...\u0027 said Sirius, frowning. \u0027Well, I\u0027ll have a think and get back to--\u0027\n He broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.\n \u0027Sirius?\u0027 said Harry anxiously.\n But he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n \u0027Why did he--?\u0027\n Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.\n The three of them ran for it. At the door of the boys\u0027 dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge\u0027s hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius\u0027s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-17.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
