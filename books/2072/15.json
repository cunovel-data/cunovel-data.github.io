{"id":111682,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"They had expected to have to comb Hermione\u0027s Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline.\\n\\n MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM\\n\\n DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED\\n\\n FIRST EVER HIGH INQUISITOR\\n\\n \u0027High Inquisitor?\u0027 said Harry darkly, his half-eaten piece of toast slipping from his fingers. \u0027What does that mean?\u0027\\n\\n Hermione read aloud:\\n\\n \u0027In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\\n\\n \u0027\"The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,\" said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. \"He is now responding to concerns, voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve of.\"\\n\\n \u0027This is not the first time in recent weeks that the Minister, Cornelius Fudge, has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school. As recently as 30th August, Educational Decree Number Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current Headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person.\\n\\n \u0027\"That\u0027s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,\" said Weasley last night. \"Dumbledore couldn\u0027t find anyone so the Minister put in Umbridge, and of course, she\u0027s been an immediate success--\" \u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s been a WHAT?\u0027 said Harry loudly.\\n\\n \u0027Wait, there\u0027s more,\u0027 said Hermione grimly.\\n\\n \u0027\"--an immediate success, totally revolutionising the teaching of Defence Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what\u0027s really happening at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\n \u0027It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalised with the passing of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, which creates the new position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor.\\n\\n \u0027\"This is an exciting new phase in the Minister\u0027s plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hogwarts,\" said Weasley. \"The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.\"\\n\\n \u0027The Ministry\u0027s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027\"I feel much easier in my mind now that I know Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,\" said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. \"Many of us with our children\u0027s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore\u0027s eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.\"\\n\\n \u0027Among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the employment of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional ex-Auror, \"Mad-Eye\" Moody.\\n\\n \u0027Rumours abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027\"I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence,\" said a Ministry insider last night.\\n\\n \u0027Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027\"Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge\u0027s office,\" said Madam Marchbanks. \"This is a further, disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.\" \u0027(For a full account of Madam Marchbanks\u0027s alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page seventeen.)\u0027\\n\\n Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.\\n\\n \u0027So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this \"Educational Decree\" and forced her on us! And now he\u0027s given her the power to inspect the other teachers!\u0027 Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \u0027I can\u0027t believe this. It\u0027s outrageous!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know it is,\u0027 said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched on the table-top, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin.\\n\\n But a grin was unfurling on Ron\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I can\u0027t wait to see McGonagall inspected,\u0027 said Ron happily. \u0027Umbridge won\u0027t know what\u0027s hit her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, come on,\u0027 said Hermione, jumping up, \u0027we\u0027d better get going, if she\u0027s inspecting Binns\u0027s class we don\u0027t want to be late ...\u0027\\n\\n But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape\u0027s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry\u0027s moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black \u0027D\u0027 scrawled in an upper corner.\\n\\n \u0027I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your OWL,\u0027 said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \u0027This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in the examination.\u0027\\n\\n Snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them.\\n\\n \u0027The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week\u0027s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a \"D\".\u0027\\n\\n He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \u0027Some people got a \"D\"? Ha!\u0027\\n\\n Harry realised that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private.\\n\\n Determined not to give Snape an excuse to tail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione\u0027s but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville\u0027s, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape\u0027s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.\\n\\n \u0027Well, that wasn\u0027t as bad as last week, was it?\u0027 said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the Entrance Hall towards lunch. \u0027And the homework didn\u0027t go too badly, either, did it?\u0027\\n\\n When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \u0027I mean, all right, I didn\u0027t expect the top grade, not if he\u0027s marking to OWL standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn\u0027t you say?\u0027\\n\\n Harry made a non-committal noise in his throat.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we\u0027ve got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we\u0027re getting now are a sort of baseline, aren\u0027t they? Something we can build on ...\u0027\\n\\n They sat down together at the Gryffindor table.\\n\\n \u0027Obviously, I\u0027d have been thrilled if I\u0027d got an \"O\"-- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hermione,\u0027 said Ron sharply, \u0027if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t--I didn\u0027t mean--well, if you want to tell me--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I got a \"P\",\u0027 said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \u0027Happy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s nothing to be ashamed of,\u0027 said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry\u0027s right. \u0027Nothing wrong with a good healthy \"P\".\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027doesn\u0027t \"P\" stand for ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"Poor\", yeah,\u0027 said Lee Jordan. \u0027Still, better than \"D\", isn\u0027t it? \"Dreadful\"?\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about OWL grades.\\n\\n \u0027So top grade\u0027s \"O\" for \"Outstanding\",\u0027 she was saying, \u0027and then there\u0027s \"A\"--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, \"E\",\u0027 George corrected her, \u0027\"E\" for \"Exceeds Expectations\". And I\u0027ve always thought Fred and I should\u0027ve got \"E\" in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\u0027\\n\\n They all laughed except Hermione, who ploughed on, \u0027So, after \"E\" it\u0027s \"A\" for \"Acceptable\", and that\u0027s the last pass grade, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole.\\n\\n \u0027Then you get \"P\" for \"Poor\"--\u0027 Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration--\u0027and \"D\" for \"Dreadful\".\\n\\n \u0027And then \"T\",\u0027 George reminded her.\\n\\n \u0027\"T\"?\u0027 asked Hermione, looking appalled. \u0027Even lower than a \"D\"? What on earth does \"T\" stand for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"Troll\",\u0027 said George promptly.\\n\\n Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received \u0027T\u0027s in all his OWLs and immediately resolved to work harder from now on.\\n\\n \u0027You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\u0027 Fred asked them.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hermione at once. \u0027Have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just now, before lunch,\u0027 said George. \u0027Charms.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What was it like?\u0027 Harry and Hermione asked together.\\n\\n Fred shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick\u0027s like, he treated her like a guest, didn\u0027t seem to bother him at all. She didn\u0027t say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t see old Flitwick getting marked down,\u0027 said George, \u0027he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027ve you got this afternoon?\u0027 Fred asked Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Trelawney--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A \"T\" if ever I saw one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--and Umbridge herself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\u0027 said George. \u0027Angelina\u0027ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\u0027\\n\\n But Harry did not have to wait for Defence Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out copies of The Dream Oracle, look round.\\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \u0027You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\u0027\\n\\n Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney\u0027s seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin.\\n\\n Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses.\\n\\n \u0027We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\u0027 she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \u0027Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each others latest night-time visions with the aid of the Oracle.\u0027\\n\\n She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left towards Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati\u0027s most recent dream.\\n\\n Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was already making notes on her clipboard. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in \u0027Trelawney\u0027s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.\\n\\n \u0027Think of a dream, quick,\u0027 he told Ron, \u0027in case the old toad comes our way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did it last time,\u0027 Ron protested, \u0027it\u0027s your turn, you tell me one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I dunno ...\u0027 said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \u0027Let\u0027s say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that\u0027ll do ...\u0027\\n\\n Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle.\\n\\n \u0027OK, we\u0027ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject ... would that be \"drowning\" or \"cauldron\" or \"Snape\"?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter, pick any of them,\u0027 said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney\u0027s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary.\\n\\n \u0027What night did you dream this again?\u0027 Ron said, immersed in calculations.\\n\\n \u0027I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\u0027 Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.\\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \u0027you\u0027ve been in this post how long, exactly?\u0027\\n\\n Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \u0027Nearly sixteen years.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quite a period,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \u0027So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Professor Trelawney shortly.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge made another note.\\n\\n \u0027And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.\\n\\n Another note on the clipboard.\\n\\n \u0027But I think-- correct me if I am mistaken--that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of Second Sight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027These things often skip--er--three generations,\u0027 said Professor Trelawney.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge\u0027s toadlike smile widened.\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 she said sweetly, making yet another note. \u0027Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\u0027 And she looked up enquiringly, still smiling.\\n\\n Professor Trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \u0027I don\u0027t understand you,\u0027 she said, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like you to make a prediction for me,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge very clearly.\\n\\n Harry and Ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books. Most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her lull height, her beads and bangles clinking.\\n\\n \u0027The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\u0027 she said in scandalised tones.\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard.\\n\\n \u0027I--but--but ... wait!\u0027 said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \u0027I ... I think I do see something ... something that concerns you ... why, I sense something ... something dark ... some grave peril ...\u0027\\n\\n Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.\\n\\n \u0027I am afraid ... I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\u0027 Professor Trelawney finished dramatically.\\n\\n There was a pause. Professor Umbridge surveyed Professor Trelawney.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \u0027Well, if that\u0027s really the best you can do ...\u0027\\n\\n She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron\u0027s eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: they both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney\u0027s side--until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that is.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry\u0027s nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \u0027Let me see the start you\u0027ve made on your dream diary, please.\u0027\\n\\n And by the time she had interpreted Harry\u0027s dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.\\n\\n She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.\\n\\n \u0027Wands away,\u0027 she instructed them all with a smile, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out, sadly returned them to their bags. \u0027As we finished Chapter One last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence \"Chapter Two, Common Defensive Theories and their Derivation\". There will be no need to talk.\u0027\\n\\n Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge had noticed, too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \u0027What is it this time, Miss Granger?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve already read Chapter Two,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Well then, proceed to Chapter Three.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve read that too. I\u0027ve read the whole book.\u0027\\n\\n Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counter-jinxes in Chapter Fifteen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,\u0027 said Hermione promptly. \u0027He says \"counter-jinx\" is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\u0027\\n\\n Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed, against her will.\\n\\n \u0027But I disagree,\u0027 Hermione continued.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge\u0027s eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.\\n\\n \u0027You disagree?\u0027 she repeated.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I do,\u0027 said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class. \u0027Mr. Slinkhard doesn\u0027t like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they\u0027re used defensively.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you do, do you?\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \u0027Well, I\u0027m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard\u0027s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But--\u0027 Hermione began.\\n\\n \u0027That is enough,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \u0027Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor house.\u0027\\n\\n There was an outbreak of muttering at this.\\n\\n \u0027What for?\u0027 said Harry angrily.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you get involved!\u0027 Hermione whispered urgently to him.\\n\\n \u0027For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \u0027I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence, but as none of them--with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects--would have passed a Ministry inspection--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\u0027 said Harry loudly, \u0027there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\u0027\\n\\n This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then--\\n\\n \u0027I think another week\u0027s detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\u0027 said Umbridge sleekly.\\n\\n The cut on the back of Harry\u0027s hand had barely healed and, by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening\u0027s detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.\\n\\n The very worst part of this second week\u0027s worth of detentions v/as, just as George had predicted, Angslina\u0027s reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Professor-- he\u0027s gone and landed himself in detention again--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s this, Potter?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \u0027Detention? From whom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027From Professor Umbridge,\u0027 muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall\u0027s beady, square-framed eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Are you telling me,\u0027 she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge\u0027s class again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry muttered, speaking to the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But--what--? Professor, no!\u0027 Harry said, furious at this injustice, \u0027I\u0027m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever!\u0027 said Professor McGonagall tartly. \u0027No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy!\u0027\\n\\n Professor McGonagall strode back towards the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside Ron, fuming.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s taken points off Gryffindor because I\u0027m having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know, mate,\u0027 said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon on to Harry\u0027s plate, \u0027she\u0027s bang out of order.\u0027\\n\\n Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027You think McGonagall was right, do you?\u0027 said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione\u0027s face.\\n\\n \u0027I wish she hadn\u0027t taken points from you, but I think she\u0027s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\u0027 said Hermione\u0027s voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.\\n\\n Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her. Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head.\\n\\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \u0027Let\u0027s see Umbridge get what she deserves.\u0027\\n\\n Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there.\\n\\n \u0027That will do,\u0027 she said and silence fell immediately. \u0027Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework--Miss Brown, please take this box of mice--don\u0027t be silly, girl, they won\u0027t hurt you--and hand one to each student--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hem, hem,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry\u0027s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an \u0027A\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Right then, everyone, listen closely--Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention--most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell. Today, we shall be--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hem, hem,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.\\n\\n \u0027I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \u0027As I was saying: today, we shall be practising the altogether more difficult Vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hem, hem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \u0027how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\u0027\\n\\n Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously.\\n\\n Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.\\n\\n \u0027As I was saying: the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be Vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So-- you know the incantation, let me see what you can do ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\u0027 Harry muttered to Ron under his breath, but he was grinning--his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while sitting in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, she rose with a grim expression on her face.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s a start,\u0027 said Ron, holding up a long wriggling mouse-tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.\\n\\n As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbndge approach the teachers desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\u0027 Professor Umbridge asked.\\n\\n \u0027Thirty-nine years this December,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.\\n\\n Professor Umbridge made a note.\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 she said, \u0027you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days\u0027 time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can hardly wait,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off towards the door. \u0027Hurry up, you three,\u0027 she added, sweeping Harry, Ron and Hermione before her.\\n\\n Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return.\\n\\n He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns towards the Forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank.\\n\\n \u0027You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\u0027 Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive Bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs.\\n\\n \u0027Quite correct,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \u0027I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\u0027\\n\\n Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.\\n\\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly. \u0027I wonder--the Headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter--can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid\u0027s very extended leave of absence?\u0027\\n\\n Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly and watch Umbridge and Grubbly-Plank closely.\\n\\n \u0027 \u0027Fraid I can\u0027t,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \u0027Don\u0027t know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks\u0027 teaching work. I accepted. That\u0027s as much as I know. Well ... shall I get started then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, please do,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard.\\n\\n Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry\u0027s spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down.\\n\\n \u0027Overall,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank\u0027s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \u0027how do you, as a temporary member of staff--an objective outsider, I suppose you might say--how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes, Dumbledore\u0027s excellent,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\u0027\\n\\n Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \u0027And what are you planning to cover with this class this year--assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in OWL,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \u0027Not much left to do--they\u0027ve studied unicorns and Nifflers, I thought we\u0027d cover Porlocks and Kneazles, make sure they can recognise Crups and Knarls, you know ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you seem to know what you\u0027re doing, at any rate,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \u0027you\u0027 and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle. \u0027Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\u0027\\n\\n Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question.\\n\\n \u0027That was me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I was slashed by a hippogriff.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A hippogriff?\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.\\n\\n \u0027Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\u0027 said Harry angrily.\\n\\n Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry\u0027s direction.\\n\\n \u0027Another night\u0027s detention, I think,\u0027 she said softly. \u0027Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that\u0027s all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jolly good,\u0027 said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.\\n\\n It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge\u0027s office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him, \u0027soak your hand in that, it\u0027s a solution of strained and pickled Murtlap tentacles, it should help.\u0027\\n\\n Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, then leapt into his lap and settled down.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks\u0027s ears with his left hand.\\n\\n \u0027I still reckon you should complain about this,\u0027 said Ron in a low voice.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry flatly.\\n\\n \u0027McGonagall would go nuts if she knew--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, she probably would,\u0027 said Harry dully. \u0027And how long do you reckon it\u0027d take Umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\u0027\\n\\n Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and, after a moment, he closed it again, defeated.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s an awful woman,\u0027 said Hermione in a small voice. \u0027Awful.You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in ... we\u0027ve got to do something about her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suggested poison,\u0027 said Ron grimly.\\n\\n \u0027No ... I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we\u0027re not going to learn any Defence from her at all,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Well, what can we do about that?\u0027 said Ron, yawning. \u0027 \u0027S too late, isn\u0027t it? She\u0027s got the job, she\u0027s here to stay. Fudge\u0027ll make sure of that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Hermione tentatively. \u0027You know, I was thinking today ...\u0027 she shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \u0027I was thinking that-- maybe the time\u0027s come when we should just--just do it ourselves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do what ourselves?\u0027 said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of Murtlap tentacles.\\n\\n \u0027Well--learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves, said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Come off it,\u0027 groaned Ron. \u0027You want us to do extra work? D\u0027you realise Harry and I are behind on homework again and it\u0027s only the second week?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But this is much more important than homework!\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n Harry and Ron goggled at her.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t think there was anything in the universe more important than homework!\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, of course there is,\u0027 said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that SPEW usually inspired in her. \u0027It\u0027s about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge\u0027s first lesson, for what\u0027s waiting for us out there. It\u0027s about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don\u0027t learn anything for a whole year--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t do much by ourselves,\u0027 said Ron in a defeated voice. \u0027I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them, I suppose--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I agree, we\u0027ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we\u0027re going wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027re talking about Lupin ...\u0027 Harry began.\\n\\n \u0027No, no, I\u0027m not talking about Lupin,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027He\u0027s too busy with the Order and, anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that\u0027s not nearly often enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who, then?\u0027 said Harry, frowning at her.\\n\\n Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it obvious?\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m talking about you,Harry.\u0027\\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron, and the fire guttered.\\n\\n \u0027About me what?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m talking about you teaching us Defence Against the Dark Arts.\u0027\\n\\n Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like SPEW. To Harry\u0027s consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated.\\n\\n He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \u0027That\u0027s an idea.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s an idea?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027You,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Teaching us to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.\\n\\n \u0027But I\u0027m not a teacher, I can\u0027t--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry, you\u0027re the best in the year at Defence Against the Dark Arts,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027Me?\u0027 said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever. \u0027No, I\u0027m not, you\u0027ve beaten me in every test--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Actually I haven\u0027t,\u0027 said Hermione coolly. \u0027You beat me in our third year--the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I\u0027m not talking about test results, Harry. Think what you\u0027ve done!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How d\u0027you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what, I\u0027m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\u0027 Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s think,\u0027 he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \u0027Uh ... first year--you saved the Philosopher\u0027s Stone from You-Know-Who.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that was luck,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027it wasn\u0027t skill--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Second year,\u0027 Ron interrupted, \u0027you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn\u0027t turned up, I--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Third year,\u0027 said Ron, louder still, \u0027you fought off about a hundred dementors at once--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn\u0027t--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Last year,\u0027 Ron said, almost shouting now, \u0027you fought off You-know-Who again--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen to me!\u0027 said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \u0027Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck--I didn\u0027t know what I was doing half the time, I didn\u0027t plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help--\u0027\\n\\n Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn\u0027t even sure why he was feeling so angry.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn\u0027t I?\u0027 he said heatedly. \u0027I know what went on, all right? And I didn\u0027t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defence Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because-- because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right--but I just blundered through it all, I didn\u0027t have a clue what I was doing--STOP LAUGHING!\u0027\\n\\n The bowl of Murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn\u0027t remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa. Ron and Hermione\u0027s smiles had vanished.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like!You--neither of you--you\u0027ve never had to face him, have you? You think it\u0027s just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you\u0027re in class or something? The whole time you\u0027re sure you know there\u0027s nothing between you and dying except your own--your own brain or guts or whatever--like you can think straight when you know you\u0027re about a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die-- they\u0027ve never taught us that in their classes, what it\u0027s like to deal with things like that--and you two sit there acting like I\u0027m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up--you just don\u0027t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn\u0027t needed me--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We weren\u0027t saying anything like that, mate,\u0027 said Ron, looking aghast. \u0027We weren\u0027t having a go at Diggory, we didn\u0027t--you\u0027ve got the wrong end of the--\u0027\\n\\n He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken.\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 she said timidly, \u0027don\u0027t you see? This ... this is exactly why we need you ... we need to know what it\u0027s r-really like ... facing him ... facing V-Voldemort.\u0027\\n\\n It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort\u0027s name and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of Murtlap essence.\\n\\n \u0027Well ... think about it,\u0027 said Hermione quietly. \u0027Please?\u0027\\n\\n Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to.\\n\\n Hermione stood up.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m off to bed,\u0027 she said, in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \u0027Erm ... night.\u0027\\n\\n Ron had got to his feet, too.\\n\\n \u0027Coming?\u0027 he said awkwardly to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027In ... in a minute. I\u0027ll just clear this up.\u0027\\n\\n He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left.\\n\\n \u0027Reparo,\u0027 Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the Murtlap essence to the bowl.\\n\\n He was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-15.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
