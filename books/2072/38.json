{"id":111701,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED RETURNS \u0027In a brief statement on Friday night, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this country and is once more active. \u0027\"It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord--well, you know who I mean--is alive and among us again,\" said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters. \"It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry\u0027s employ. We believe the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord-- Thingy. \u0027\"We urge the magician population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month.\" \u0027The Minister\u0027s statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was \"no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more.\" \u0027Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that He Who Must Not Be Named and a select band of followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening. \u0027Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, has so far been unavailable for comment. He has insisted over the past year that You-Know-Who is not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power. Meanwhile, the \"Boy Who Lived\"--\u0027 \u0027There you are, Harry, I knew they\u0027d drag you into it somehow,\u0027 said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him. They were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of Ron\u0027s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione\u0027s bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit, clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside-down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying. \u0027He\u0027s the \"boy who lived\" again now, though, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 said Ron darkly. \u0027Not such a deluded show-off any more, eh?\u0027 He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain\u0027s tentacles had wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly\u0027s Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement. \u0027Yes, they\u0027re very complimentary about you now, Harry,\u0027 said Hermione, scanning down the article. \u0027\"A lone voice of truth ... perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story ... forced to bear ridicule and slander ...\"Hmmm,\u0027 she said, frowning, \u0027I notice they don\u0027t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the Prophet ...\u0027 She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey\u0027s words, \u0027quite enough damage to be going on with\u0027. Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day, was improving greatly, and was already bored with the hospital wing. \u0027You-Know-Who\u0027s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to Jour, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine ...Well,\u0027 said Hermione, folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside, \u0027it\u0027s certainly given them lots to write about. And that interview with Harry isn\u0027t exclusive, it\u0027s the one that was in The Quibbler months ago ...\u0027 \u0027Daddy sold it to them,\u0027 said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The Quibbler.\u0027He got a very good price for it, too, so we\u0027re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer to see if we can catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack.\u0027 \u0027Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said, That sounds lovely.\u0027 Ginny caught Harry\u0027s eye and looked away quickly, grinning. \u0027So, anyway,\u0027 said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, \u0027what\u0027s going on in school?\u0027 \u0027Well, Flitwick\u0027s got rid of Fred and George\u0027s swamp,\u0027 said Ginny, \u0027he did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he\u0027s roped it off--\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 said Hermione, looking startled. \u0027Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,\u0027 said Ginny, shrugging. \u0027I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,\u0027 said Ron, through a mouthful of chocolate. \u0027They sent me all these, you know,\u0027 he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. \u0027Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?\u0027 Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked, \u0027So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore\u0027s back?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Neville, \u0027everything\u0027s settled right back to normal.\u0027 \u0027I s\u0027pose Filch is happy, is he?\u0027 asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog Card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug. \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027He\u0027s really, really miserable, actually ...\u0027 She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u0027He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts ...\u0027 All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the Forest to rescue her from the centaurs; how he had done it--how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him--nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her, either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed. \u0027Madam Pomfrey says she\u0027s just in shock,\u0027 whispered Hermione. \u0027Sulking, more like,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,\u0027 said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly. \u0027Anything wrong, Professor?\u0027 called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door. \u0027No ... no ...\u0027 said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows. \u0027No, I must have been dreaming ...\u0027 Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes. \u0027Speaking of centaurs,\u0027 said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, \u0027who\u0027s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s got to,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027the other centaurs won\u0027t take him back, will they?\u0027 \u0027It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027Bet Dumbledore wishes he could\u0027ve got rid of Trelawney for good,\u0027 said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. \u0027Mind you, the whole subject\u0027s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn\u0027t a lot better ...\u0027 \u0027How can you say that?\u0027 Hermione demanded. \u0027After we\u0027ve just found out that there are real prophecies?\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way ... \u0027It is a pity it broke,\u0027 said Hermione quietly, shaking her head. \u0027Yeah, it is,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Still, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either-- where are you going?\u0027 he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up. \u0027Er--Hagrid\u0027s,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You know, he just got back and I promised I\u0027d go down and see him and tell him how you two are.\u0027 \u0027Oh, all right then,\u0027 said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. \u0027Wish we could come.\u0027 \u0027Say hello to him for us!\u0027 called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. \u0027And ask him what\u0027s happening about ... about his little friend!\u0027 Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory. The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went; he could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid. He was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not; whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though, as he had not talked to him properly since he\u0027d returned ... Harry had just descended the last marble step into the Entrance Hall when Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. The only sounds were the shouts, laughter and splashes drifting into the Hall from the grounds through the open front doors. Malfoy glanced around--Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers--then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, \u0027You\u0027re dead, Potter.\u0027 Harry raised his eyebrows. \u0027Funny.\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027d think I\u0027d have stopped walking around ...\u0027 Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him; he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage. \u0027You\u0027re going to pay,\u0027 said Malfoy, in a voice barely louder than a whisper. \u0027I\u0027m going to make you pay for what you\u0027ve done to my father ...\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m terrified now,\u0027 said Harry sarcastically. \u0027I s\u0027pose Lord Voldemort\u0027s just a warm-up act compared to you three--what\u0027s the matter?\u0027 he added, for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. \u0027He\u0027s a mate of your dad, isn\u0027t he? Not scared of him, are you?\u0027 \u0027You think you\u0027re such a big man, Potter,\u0027 said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. \u0027You wait. I\u0027ll have you. You can\u0027t land my father in prison--\u0027 \u0027I thought I just had,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027The dementors have left Azkaban,\u0027 said Malfoy quietly. \u0027Dad and the others\u0027ll be out in no time ...\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I expect they will,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Still, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now--\u0027 Malfoy\u0027s hand flew towards his wand, but Harry was too quick for him; he had drawn his own wand before Malfoy\u0027s fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes. \u0027Potter!\u0027 The voice rang across the Entrance Hall. Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards Malfoy ... whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . . . never ... \u0027What are you doing, Potter?\u0027 said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them. \u0027I\u0027m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,\u0027 said Harry fiercely. Snape stared at him. \u0027Put that wand away at once,\u0027 he said curtly. \u0027Ten points from Gryff--\u0027 Snape looked towards the giant hour-glasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile. \u0027Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hour-glass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to--\u0027 \u0027Add some more?\u0027 Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone, steps into the castle; she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well. \u0027Professor McGonagall!\u0027 said Snape, striding forwards. \u0027Out of St. Mungo\u0027s, I see!\u0027 \u0027Yes, Professor Snape,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. shrugging off her travelling cloak, \u0027I\u0027m quite as good as new. You two--Crabbe--Goyle--\u0027 She beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward. \u0027Here,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe\u0027s chest and her cloak into Goyle\u0027s, \u0027take these up to my office for me.\u0027 They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase. \u0027Right then,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall. \u0027Well, I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who! What say you, Professor Snape?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well. \u0027Oh--well--I suppose ...\u0027 \u0027So that\u0027s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom and Miss Granger,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor s hour-glass as she spoke. \u0027Oh--and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,\u0027 she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw\u0027s glass. \u0027Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape--so there we are ...\u0027 A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless. \u0027Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,\u0027 Professor McGonagall continued briskly. Harry did not need telling twice; he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy. The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards Hagrid\u0027s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets, looked up at him as he passed; some called out to him, or else waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way. He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid\u0027s cabin door that he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden. \u0027All righ\u0027, Harry!\u0027 he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. \u0027Come in, come in, we\u0027ll have a cup o\u0027 dandelion juice ... \u0027How\u0027s things?\u0027 Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. \u0027Yeh--er--feelin\u0027 all righ\u0027, are yeh?\u0027 Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid\u0027s face that he was not referring to Harry\u0027s physical well-being. \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid\u0027s mind. \u0027So, where\u0027ve you been?\u0027 \u0027Bin hidin\u0027 out in the mountains,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Up in a cave, like Sirius did when he--\u0027 Hagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice. \u0027Anyway, back now,\u0027 he said feebly. \u0027You--you look better,\u0027 said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius. \u0027Wha?\u0027 said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face. \u0027Oh--oh yeah. Well, Grawpy\u0027s loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. He\u0027s a good lad, really ... Ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend, actually ...\u0027 Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once; the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the Forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half-emptying his glass. \u0027Ev\u0027ryone knows yeh\u0027ve bin tellin\u0027 the truth now, Harry\u0027 said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. He was watching Harry closely. \u0027Tha\u0027s gotta be better, hasn\u0027 it?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027Look ...\u0027 Hagrid leaned towards him across the table, \u0027I knew Sirius longer \u0027n yeh did ... he died in battle, an tha\u0027s the way he\u0027d\u0027ve wanted ter go--\u0027 \u0027He didn\u0027t want to go at all!\u0027 said Harry angrily. Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head. \u0027Nah, I don\u0027 reckon he did,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027But still, Harry ... he was never one ter sit aroun\u0027 at home an\u0027 let other people do the fightin\u0027. He couldn\u0027ve lived with himself if he hadn\u0027 gone ter help--\u0027 Harry leapt up. \u0027I\u0027ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,\u0027 he said mechanically. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Hagrid, looking rather upset. \u0027Oh ... all righ\u0027 then, Harry ... take care o\u0027 yerself then, an\u0027 drop back in if yeh\u0027ve got a mo ...\u0027 \u0027Yeah ... right ...\u0027 Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open; he was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye, and walking away across the lawn. Once again, people called out to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds ... A few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back, and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however ... He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passers-by behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking ... Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was--he had always been--a marked man. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant ... And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny, and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder ... He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors ... The sun had set before he realised he was cold. He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went. Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term. Hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make \u0027hushing\u0027 noises every time she mentioned his name. Harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He knew one thing, though: unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days\u0027 time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more. Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed, and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the Entrance Hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only half-heartedly to restrain them. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick. Their last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term leaving feast, but Harry had not even started. \u0027Just do it tomorrow!\u0027 said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. \u0027Come on, I\u0027m starving.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t be long ... look, you go ahead ...\u0027 But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the Leaving Feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort\u0027s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all ... Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it. He realised what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve Grimmauld Place. \u0027Use it if you need me, all right?\u0027 Harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him. He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius. This is a two-way mirror, I\u0027ve got the other one of the pair. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you\u0027ll appear in my mirror and I\u0027ll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions. Harry\u0027s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it-- He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said, loudly and clearly, \u0027Sirius.\u0027 His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own. He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room: \u0027Sirius Black!\u0027 Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own ... Sirius didn\u0027t have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry\u0027s head. That\u0027s why it\u0027s not working ... Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again ... Disappointment was burning in his throat; he got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror-- But then an idea struck him ... a better idea than a mirror ... a much bigger, more important idea ... how had he never thought of it before--why had he never asked? He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing; he hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him: \u0027The feast is about to start, you know, you\u0027re cutting it very fine!\u0027 But Harry had no intention of going to the feast ... How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn\u0027t need one, yet now ... He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast ... But just as he had given up hope, he saw it--a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor. \u0027Hey--hey, Nick! NICK!\u0027 The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. \u0027Good evening,\u0027 he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. \u0027I am not the only one who is late, then? Though,\u0027 he sighed, \u0027in a rather different sense, of course ...\u0027 \u0027Nick, can I ask you something?\u0027 A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick\u0027s face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely. \u0027Er--now, Harry?\u0027 said Nick, looking discomfited. \u0027Can\u0027t it wait until after the feast?\u0027 \u0027No--Nick-- please,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027I really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?\u0027 Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed. \u0027Oh, very well,\u0027 he said, looking resigned. \u0027I can\u0027t pretend I haven\u0027t been expecting it.\u0027 Harry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead. \u0027Expecting what?\u0027 Harry asked, as he closed the door. \u0027You to come and find me,\u0027 said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. \u0027It happens, sometimes ... when somebody has suffered a ... loss.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Harry, refusing to be deflected. \u0027You were right, I\u0027ve--I\u0027ve come to find you.\u0027 Nick said nothing. \u0027It\u0027s--\u0027 said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, \u0027it\u0027s just-- you\u0027re dead. But you\u0027re still here, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds. \u0027That\u0027s right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Harry urged him. \u0027You died, but I\u0027m talking to you ... you can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, \u0027I walk and talk, yes.\u0027 \u0027So, you came back, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 said Harry urgently. \u0027People can come back, right? As ghosts. They don\u0027t have to disappear completely. Well?\u0027 he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing. Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, \u0027Not everyone can come back as a ghost.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 said Harry quickly. \u0027Only ... only wizards.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. \u0027Well, that\u0027s OK then, the person I\u0027m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?\u0027 Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry. \u0027He won\u0027t come back.\u0027 \u0027Who?\u0027 \u0027Sirius Black,\u0027 said Nick. \u0027But you did!\u0027 said Harry angrily. \u0027You came back--you\u0027re dead and you didn\u0027t disappear--\u0027 \u0027Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,\u0027 said Nick miserably. \u0027But very few wizards choose that path.\u0027 \u0027Why not?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Anyway--it doesn\u0027t matter--Sirius won\u0027t care if it\u0027s unusual, he\u0027ll come back, I know he will!\u0027 And so strong was his belief, Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly-white and transparent but beaming, walking through it towards him. \u0027He will not come back,\u0027 repeated Nick. \u0027He will have ... gone on.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean, \"gone on\"?\u0027 said Harry quickly. \u0027Gone on where? Listen--what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn\u0027t everyone come back? Why isn\u0027t this place full of ghosts? Why--?\u0027 \u0027I cannot answer,\u0027 said Nick. \u0027You\u0027re dead, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 said Harry exasperatedly. \u0027Who can answer better than you?\u0027 \u0027I was afraid of death,\u0027 said Nick softly. \u0027I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn\u0027t to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact, I am neither here nor there ...\u0027 He gave a small sad chuckle. \u0027I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries--\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me about that place!\u0027 said Harry fiercely. \u0027I am sorry not to have been more help,\u0027 said Nick gently. \u0027Well ... well, do excuse me ... the feast, you know ...\u0027 And he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared. Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again. He had turned the corner towards the Fat Lady\u0027s corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him it was Luna. There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment. \u0027Hello,\u0027 said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice. \u0027How come you\u0027re not at the feast?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027Well, I\u0027ve lost most of my possessions,\u0027 said Luna serenely. \u0027People take them and hide them, you know. But as it\u0027s the last night, I really do need them back, so I\u0027ve been putting up signs.\u0027 She gestured towards the noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return. An odd feeling rose in Harry; an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius\u0027s death. It was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for Luna. \u0027How come people hide your stuff?\u0027 he asked her, frowning. \u0027Oh ... well ...\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I think they think I\u0027m a bit odd, you know. Some people call me \"Loony\" Lovegood, actually.\u0027 Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully. \u0027That\u0027s no reason for them to take your things,\u0027 he said flatly. \u0027D\u0027you want help finding them?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 she said, smiling at him. \u0027They\u0027ll come back, they always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway ... why aren\u0027t you at the feast?\u0027 Harry shrugged. \u0027Just didn\u0027t feel like it.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. \u0027I don\u0027t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn\u0027t he? Ginny told me.\u0027 Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she, too, could see Thestrals. \u0027Have you ...\u0027 he began. \u0027I mean, who ... has anyone you known ever died?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Luna simply, \u0027my mother. She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Harry mumbled. \u0027Yes, it was rather horrible,\u0027 said Luna conversationally. \u0027I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I\u0027ve still got Dad. And anyway, it\u0027s not as though I\u0027ll never see Mum again, is it?\u0027 \u0027Er--isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Harry uncertainly. She shook her head in disbelief. \u0027Oh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027You mean ...\u0027 \u0027In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that\u0027s all. You heard them.\u0027 They looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to think; Luna believed so many extraordinary things ... yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil, too. \u0027Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to help you look for your stuff?\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 said Luna. \u0027No, I think I\u0027ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up ... it always does in the end ... well, have a nice holiday, Harry.\u0027 \u0027Yeah ... yeah, you too.\u0027 She walked away from him and, as he watched her go, he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly. The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of DA members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry\u0027s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot, had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniform as Harry, Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze. \u0027I must say, I\u0027m looking forward to seeing Malfoy\u0027s mother\u0027s face when he gets off the train,\u0027 said Ernie, with some satisfaction, as he watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. \u0027Goyle\u0027s mum\u0027ll be really pleased, though,\u0027 said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. \u0027He\u0027s loads better-looking now ... anyway, Harry, the food trolley\u0027s just stopped if you want anything ...\u0027 Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched. Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet.It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning ... \u0027It hasn\u0027t really started yet,\u0027 sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. \u0027But it won\u0027t be long now ...\u0027 \u0027Hey, Harry,\u0027 said Ron softly, nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor. Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho\u0027s eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron\u0027s knight. \u0027What\u0027s--er-- going on with you and her, anyway?\u0027 Ron asked quietly. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Harry truthfully. \u0027I--er--heard she\u0027s going out with someone else now,\u0027 said Hermione tentatively. Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him; so much of what he had wanted before Sirius\u0027s death felt that way these days ... the week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer; it stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without. \u0027You\u0027re well out of it, mate,\u0027 said Ron forcefully. \u0027I mean, she\u0027s quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s probably cheerful enough with someone else,\u0027 said Harry, shrugging. \u0027Who\u0027s she with now, anyway?\u0027 Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered. \u0027Michael Corner,\u0027 she said. \u0027Michael--but-- \u0027 said Ron, craning around in his seat to state at her. \u0027But you were going out with him!\u0027 \u0027Not any more,\u0027 said Ginny resolutely. \u0027He didn\u0027t like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch, and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.\u0027 She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside-down and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted. \u0027Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,\u0027 he said, prodding his queen forwards towards Harry\u0027s quivering castle. \u0027Good for you. Just choose someone--better--next time.\u0027 He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it. \u0027Well, I\u0027ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he\u0027s better?\u0027 asked Ginny vaguely. \u0027WHAT?\u0027 shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead. As the train slowed down in the approach to King\u0027s Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig\u0027s cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual. When the ticket inspector signalled to Harry, Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all. There was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend The Weird Sisters.Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair greying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material. \u0027Ron, Ginny!\u0027 called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly. \u0027Oh, and Harry dear--how are you?\u0027 \u0027Fine,\u0027 lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins\u0027 new clothes. \u0027What are they supposed to be?\u0027 he asked, pointing at the jackets. \u0027Finest dragonskin, little bro\u0027,\u0027 said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. \u0027Business is booming and we thought we\u0027d treat ourselves.\u0027 \u0027Hello, Harry,\u0027 said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione. \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I didn\u0027t expect ... what are you all doing here?\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lupin with a slight smile, \u0027we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.\u0027 \u0027I dunno if that\u0027s a good idea,\u0027 said Harry at once. \u0027Oh, I think it is,\u0027 growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. \u0027That\u0027ll be them, will it, Potter?\u0027 He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry\u0027s reception committee. \u0027Ah, Harry!\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione\u0027s parents, who he had just greeted enthusiastically, and who were now taking it in turns to hug Hermione. \u0027Well-- shall we do it, then?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I reckon so, Arthur,\u0027 said Moody. He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station towards the Dursleys, who were apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group. \u0027Good afternoon,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him. \u0027You might remember me, my name\u0027s Arthur Weasley.\u0027 As Mr. Weasley had single-handedly demolished most of the Dursleys\u0027 living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed; she kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly. \u0027We thought we\u0027d just have a few words with you about Harry,\u0027 said Mr. Weasley, still smiling. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027About how he\u0027s treated when he\u0027s at your place.\u0027 Uncle Vernon\u0027s moustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody. \u0027I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house--\u0027 \u0027I expect what you\u0027re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027Anyway, that\u0027s not the point,\u0027 interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. \u0027The point is, if we find out you\u0027ve been horrible to Harry-- \u0027 \u0027--And make no mistake, we\u0027ll hear about it,\u0027 added Lupin pleasantly. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mr Weasley, \u0027even if you won\u0027t let Harry use the felly-tone--\u0027 \u0027Telephone,\u0027 whispered Hermione. \u0027--Yeah, if we get any hint that Potter\u0027s been mistreated in any way, you\u0027ll have us to answer to,\u0027 said Moody. Uncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs. \u0027Are you threatening me, sir?\u0027 he said, so loudly that passers-by actually turned to stare. \u0027Yes, I am,\u0027 said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly. \u0027And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?\u0027 barked Uncle Vernon. \u0027Well ...\u0027 said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. \u0027Yes, I\u0027d have to say you do, Dursley.\u0027 He turned away from Uncle Vernon to survey Harry. \u0027So, Potter ... give us a shout if you need us. If we don\u0027t hear from you for three days in a row, we\u0027ll send someone along ...\u0027 Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path. \u0027Bye, then, Potter,\u0027 said Moody, grasping Harry\u0027s shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand. \u0027Take care, Harry,\u0027 said Lupin quietly. \u0027Keep in touch.\u0027 \u0027Harry, we\u0027ll have you away from there as soon as we can,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley whispered, hugging him again. \u0027We\u0027ll see you soon, mate,\u0027 said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry\u0027s hand. \u0027Really soon, Harry,\u0027 said Hermione earnestly. \u0027We promise.\u0027 Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-38.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
