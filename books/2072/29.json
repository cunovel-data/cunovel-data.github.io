{"id":111692,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u0027But why haven\u0027t you got Occlumency lessons any more?\u0027 said Hermione, frowning. \u0027I\u0027ve told you,\u0027 Harry muttered. \u0027Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I\u0027ve got the basics.\u0027 \u0027So you\u0027ve stopped having funny dreams?\u0027 said Hermione sceptically. \u0027Pretty much,\u0027 said Harry, not looking at her. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t think Snape should stop until you\u0027re absolutely sure you can control them!\u0027 said Hermione indignantly. \u0027Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask-- \u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry forcefully. \u0027Just drop it, Hermione, OK?\u0027 It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful. Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams. \u0027How can that come as a shock?\u0027 Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron\u0027s timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject. \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027there\u0027s been a lot going on.\u0027 \u0027Well, there you are,\u0027 she said, handing him his timetable, \u0027if you follow that you should do fine.\u0027 Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened. \u0027You\u0027ve given me an evening off every week!\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s for Quidditch practice,\u0027 said Hermione. The smile faded from Ron\u0027s face. \u0027What\u0027s the point?\u0027 he said dully. \u0027We\u0027ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad\u0027s got of becoming Minister for Magic.\u0027 Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched. \u0027What\u0027s wrong, Harry?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 he said quickly. \u0027Nothing.\u0027 He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione\u0027s chair. \u0027I saw Cho earlier,\u0027 said Hermione tentatively. \u0027She looked really miserable, too ... have you two had a row again?\u0027 \u0027Wha--oh, yeah, we have,\u0027 said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse. \u0027What about?\u0027 \u0027That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Yeah, well, I don\u0027t blame you!\u0027 said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. \u0027If it hadn\u0027t been for her ...\u0027 Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say \u0027Yeah\u0027 and That\u0027s right\u0027 whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve. He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father\u0027s character. Hadn\u0027t people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry\u0027s head ... he was as bad, wasn\u0027t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it ... not unless they really loathed them ... perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it . Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James\u0027s hands: but hadn\u0027t Lily asked, \u0027What\u0027s he done to you?\u0027 And hadn\u0027t James replied, \u0027It\u0027s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.\u0027 Hadn\u0027t James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius ... but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen ... Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it ... For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now ... now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him. The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged. \u0027Harry, I\u0027m talking to you, can you hear me?\u0027 \u0027Huh?\u0027 He looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice. \u0027Oh, hi,\u0027 said Harry, pulling his books towards him. \u0027How come you\u0027re not at practice?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s over,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Well, we\u0027re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat.\u0027 She sighed heavily. \u0027Anyway ... a package just arrived, it\u0027s only just got through Umbridge\u0027s new screening process.\u0027 She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor. \u0027It\u0027s Easter eggs from Mum,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027There\u0027s one for you ... there you go.\u0027 She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat. \u0027Are you OK, Harry?\u0027 Ginny asked quietly. \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m fine,\u0027 said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this. \u0027You seem really down lately,\u0027 Ginny persisted. \u0027You know, I\u0027m sure if you just talked to Cho ...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not Cho I want to talk to,\u0027 said Harry brusquely. \u0027Who is it, then?\u0027 asked Ginny, watching him closely. \u0027I ...\u0027 He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile cf books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott. \u0027I wish I could talk to Sirius,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027But I know I can\u0027t.\u0027 Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, \u0027if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.\u0027 \u0027Come on,\u0027 said Harry dully. \u0027With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?\u0027 \u0027The thing about growing up with Fred and George,\u0027 said Ginny thoughtfully, \u0027is that you sort of start thinking anything\u0027s possible if you\u0027ve got enough nerve.\u0027 Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate--Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors--or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. \u0027WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?\u0027 \u0027Oh damn,\u0027 whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. \u0027I forgot--\u0027 Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled face contorted with rage. \u0027Chocolate in the library!\u0027 she screamed. \u0027Out--out--OUT!\u0027 And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry\u0027s books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran. As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read: CAREERS ADVICE All fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first week of the summer term to discuss their future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below. Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall\u0027s office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t fancy Healing,\u0027 said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo\u0027s on its front. \u0027It says here you need at least \"E\" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I mean ... blimey ... don\u0027t want much, do they?\u0027 \u0027Well, it\u0027s a very responsible job, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Hermione absently. She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, \u0027SO YOU THINK YOU\u0027D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!\u0027 \u0027You\u0027d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,\u0027 said Harry darkly. \u0027Good sense of when to duck, more like.\u0027 He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. \u0027Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad ...They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t much fancy banking,\u0027 said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: \u0027HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?\u0027 \u0027Hey,\u0027 said a voice in Harry\u0027s ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. \u0027Ginny\u0027s had a word with us about you,\u0027 said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. \u0027She says you need to talk to Sirius?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up \u0027MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES\u0027. \u0027Yeah ...\u0027 said Harry, trying to sound casual, \u0027yeah, I thought I\u0027d like--\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be so ridiculous,\u0027 said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. \u0027With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?\u0027 \u0027Well, we think we can find a way around that,\u0027 said George, stretching and smiling. \u0027It\u0027s a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?\u0027 \u0027What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?\u0027 continued Fred. \u0027No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we\u0027d have messed up people\u0027s revision, too, which would be the very last thing we\u0027d want to do.\u0027 He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness. \u0027But it\u0027s business as usual from tomorrow,\u0027 Fred continued briskly. \u0027And if we\u0027re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?\u0027 \u0027Yes, but still,\u0027 said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, \u0027even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?\u0027 \u0027Umbridge\u0027s office,\u0027 said Harry quietly. He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own. \u0027Are--you-- insane?\u0027 said Hermione in a hushed voice. Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily. \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Harry, shrugging. \u0027And how are you going to get in there in the first place?\u0027 Harry was ready for this question. \u0027Sirius\u0027s knife,\u0027 he said. \u0027Excuse me?\u0027 \u0027Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that\u0027ll open any lock,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027So even if she\u0027s bewitched the door so Alahomora won\u0027t work, which I bet she has-- \u0027 \u0027What do you think about this?\u0027 Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry\u0027s first dinner in Grimmauld Place. \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. \u0027If Harry wants to do it, it\u0027s up to him, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,\u0027 said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. \u0027Right, then. We\u0027re thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact in everybody\u0027s in the corridors--Harry, we\u0027ll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office--I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?\u0027 he said, looking at George. \u0027Easy,\u0027 said George. \u0027What sort of diversion is it?\u0027 asked Ron. \u0027You\u0027ll see, little bro\u0027, said Fred, as he and George got up again. \u0027At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy\u0027s corridor round about five o\u0027clock tomorrow.\u0027 Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge\u0027s office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office. After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville\u0027s bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius\u0027s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his father\u0027s behaviour ... Something caught Harry\u0027s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress. With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge\u0027s office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione\u0027s almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o\u0027clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore. \u0027... and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she\u0027ll be able to guess you\u0027ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she\u0027ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions ...\u0027 \u0027Hermione,\u0027 said Ron in a low and indignant voice, \u0027are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?\u0027 \u0027You take notes for a change, it won\u0027t kill you!\u0027 By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks. Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon\u0027s favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape\u0027s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an \u0027E\u0027. He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure. \u0027Whoops,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Another zero, then, Potter.\u0027 Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished. \u0027I\u0027m sorry!\u0027 said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. \u0027I\u0027m really sorry, Harry. I thought you\u0027d finished, so I cleared up!\u0027 Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge\u0027s office. He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn\u0027t in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late. \u0027Sorry, Professor,\u0027 he panted, as he closed the door. \u0027I forgot.\u0027 \u0027No matter, Potter,\u0027 she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round. Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face. \u0027Sit down, Potter,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk. Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard. \u0027Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. \u0027Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?\u0027 \u0027Er--\u0027 said Harry. He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting. \u0027Yes?\u0027 Professor McGonagall prompted Harry. \u0027Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,\u0027 Harry mumbled. \u0027You\u0027d need top grades for that,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. \u0027They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \"Exceeds Expectations\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It\u0027s a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don\u0027t think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.\u0027 At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her. \u0027You\u0027ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?\u0027 she went on, talking a little louder than before. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027Naturally,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u0027I would also advise--\u0027 Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened. \u0027I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \"Exceeds Expectations\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I\u0027d say you\u0027re averaging \"Acceptable\" at the moment, so you\u0027ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,\u0027 she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. \u0027Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \"Outstanding\" in their OWLs, so --\u0027 Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet. \u0027May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?\u0027 Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge. \u0027Oh, no, thank you very much,\u0027 said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. \u0027I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?\u0027 \u0027I daresay you\u0027ll find you can,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth. \u0027I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?\u0027 said Professor Umbridge sweetly. \u0027Were you?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall haughtily. \u0027Well, Potter,\u0027 she continued, as though there had been no interruption, \u0027if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \"Acceptable\" and \"Exceeds Expectations\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you--are you quite sure you wouldn\u0027t like a cough drop, Dolores?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,\u0027 simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. \u0027I was just concerned that you might not have Harry\u0027s most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I\u0027m quite sure I slipped in a note.\u0027 \u0027What, this thing?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry\u0027s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment. \u0027Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror--\u0027 \u0027Did you not understand my note, Minerva?\u0027 asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough. \u0027Of course I understood it,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled. \u0027Well, then, I am confused ... I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that--\u0027 \u0027False hope?\u0027 repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. \u0027He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests--\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me--\u0027 \u0027I should have made my meaning plainer,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. \u0027He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.\u0027 Professor Umbridge\u0027s smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning. \u0027Any questions, Potter?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, \u0027perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you\u0027ve left school, so unless you\u0027re prepared to--\u0027 \u0027I think you\u0027ll also find,\u0027 said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, \u0027that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.\u0027 \u0027--unless you\u0027re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another--\u0027 \u0027Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.\u0027 \u0027A very good chance, then,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall. \u0027Potter has a criminal record,\u0027 said Umbridge loudly. \u0027Potter has been cleared of all charges,\u0027 said McGonagall, even more loudly. Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister. \u0027Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!\u0027 Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge. \u0027Potter,\u0027 she said in ringing tones, \u0027I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!\u0027 \u0027The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!\u0027 said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously. \u0027There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!\u0027 shouted Professor McGonagall. \u0027Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. \u0027Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you\u0027ll be where I am, don\u0027t you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!\u0027 \u0027You are raving,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. \u0027Potter, that concludes our careers consultation.\u0027 Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor. Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon. \u0027I hope you\u0027ve thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,\u0027 Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to \u0027Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation\u0027. \u0027Umbridge looks like she\u0027s in a really bad mood already ...\u0027 Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking ... He could just imagine Professor McGonagall\u0027s reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge\u0027s office mere hours after she had vouched for him ... there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve ... nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach ... and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father\u0027s old Invisibility Cloak. But the fact remained that if he was caught ... \u0027Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!\u0027 whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge. \u0027And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!\u0027 He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer\u0027s day more than twenty years ago ... And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room ... You\u0027re less like your father than I thought ... the risk would\u0027ve been what made it fun for James ... But did he want to be like his father any more? \u0027Harry, don\u0027t do it, please don\u0027t do it!\u0027 Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class. He did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, \u0027Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully-- Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never. \u0027Harry--please!\u0027 Hermione pleaded weakly. But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing. Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge\u0027s office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius\u0027s knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge\u0027s door. He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around. Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks. Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder. He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames. \u0027Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!\u0027 Harry said loudly and clearly. It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge\u0027s office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire ... And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment. \u0027Sirius?\u0027 The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin. \u0027Harry!\u0027 he said, looking thoroughly shocked. \u0027What are you--what\u0027s happened, is everything all right?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I just wondered--I mean, I just fancied a--a chat with Sirius.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll call him,\u0027 said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, \u0027he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again ...\u0027 And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge\u0027s hard stone floor. Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later. \u0027What is it?\u0027 said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. \u0027Are you all right? Do you need help?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027it\u0027s nothing like that ... I just wanted to talk ... about my dad.\u0027 They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve. When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen--\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m fifteen,\u0027 said Harry heatedly. \u0027Look, Harry\u0027 said Sirius placatingly, \u0027James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can\u0027t you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be--he was popular, he was good at Quidditch--good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James--whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry--always hated the Dark Arts.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because--well, just because you said you were bored,\u0027 he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice. \u0027I \u0027m not proud of it,\u0027 said Sirius quickly. Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, \u0027Look, Harry, what you\u0027ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did-- everyone thought they were the height of cool--if they sometimes got a bit carried away--\u0027 \u0027If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,\u0027 said Sirius. Lupin smiled. \u0027He kept messing up his hair,\u0027 said Harry in a pained voice. Sirius and Lupin laughed. \u0027I\u0027d forgotten he used to do that,\u0027 said Sirius affectionately. \u0027Was he playing with the Snitch?\u0027 said Lupin eagerly. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. \u0027Well ... I thought he was a bit of an idiot.\u0027 \u0027Of course he was a bit of an idiot!\u0027 said Sirius bracingly, \u0027we were all idiots! Well-- not Moony so much,\u0027 he said fairly, looking at Lupin. But Lupin shook his head. \u0027Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?\u0027 he said. \u0027Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, well,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes ... that was something ...\u0027 \u0027And,\u0027 said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, \u0027he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!\u0027 \u0027Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,\u0027 said Sirius, shrugging, \u0027he couldn\u0027t stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.\u0027 \u0027How come she married him?\u0027 Harry asked miserably. \u0027She hated him!\u0027 \u0027Nah, she didn\u0027t,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027She started going out with him in seventh year,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027Once James had deflated his head a bit,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027Even Snape?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Lupin slowly, \u0027Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn\u0027t really expect James to take that lying down, could you?\u0027 \u0027And my mum was OK with that?\u0027 \u0027She didn\u0027t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027I mean, James didn\u0027t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?\u0027 Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced. \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, \u0027your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, OK,\u0027 said Harry heavily. \u0027I just never thought I\u0027d feel sorry for Snape.\u0027 \u0027Now you mention it,\u0027 said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, \u0027how did Snape react when he found you\u0027d seen all this?\u0027 \u0027He told me he\u0027d never teach me Occlumency again,\u0027 said Harry indifferently, \u0027like that\u0027s a big disappoint--\u0027 \u0027He WHAT?\u0027 shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes. \u0027Are you serious, Harry?\u0027 said Lupin quickly. \u0027He\u0027s stopped giving you lessons?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. \u0027But it\u0027s OK, I don\u0027t care, it\u0027s a bit of a relief to tell you the--\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m coming up there to have a word with Snape!\u0027 said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again. \u0027If anyone\u0027s going to tell Snape it will be me!\u0027 he said firmly. \u0027But Harry, first of all, you\u0027re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons--when Dumbledore hears--\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t tell him that, he\u0027d kill me!\u0027 said Harry, outraged. \u0027You didn\u0027t see him when we got out of the Pensieve.\u0027 \u0027Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!\u0027 said Lupin sternly. \u0027Do you understand me? Nothing!\u0027 \u0027OK, OK,\u0027 said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. \u0027I\u0027ll ... I\u0027ll try and say something to him ... but it won\u0027t be--\u0027 He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps. \u0027Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Sirius, glancing behind him. \u0027It must be somebody your end.\u0027 Harry\u0027s heart skipped several beats. \u0027I\u0027d better go!\u0027 he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge\u0027s fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die. \u0027Quickly, quickly!\u0027 he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. \u0027Ah, she\u0027s left it open--\u0027 Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge\u0027s desk and began rifling through the papers inside it. \u0027Approval for Whipping ... Approval for Whipping ... I can do it at last ... they\u0027ve had it coming to them for years ...\u0027 He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest. Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go. One landing down from Umbridge\u0027s office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there. It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered. \u0027So!\u0027 said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. \u0027So--you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?\u0027 \u0027Pretty amusing, yeah,\u0027 said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear. Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness. \u0027I\u0027ve got the form, Headmistress,\u0027 he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. \u0027I\u0027ve got the form and I\u0027ve got the whips waiting ... oh, let me do it now ...\u0027 \u0027Very good, Argus,\u0027 she said. \u0027You two,\u0027 she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, \u0027are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.\u0027 \u0027You know what?\u0027 said Fred. \u0027I don\u0027t think we are.\u0027 He turned to his twin. \u0027George,\u0027 said Fred, \u0027I think we\u0027ve outgrown full-time education.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I\u0027ve been feeling that way myself,\u0027 said George lightly. \u0027Time to test our talents in the real world, d\u0027you reckon?\u0027 asked Fred. \u0027Definitely,\u0027 said George. And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together: \u0027Accio brooms!\u0027 Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George\u0027s broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor. \u0027We won\u0027t be seeing you,\u0027 Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick. \u0027Yeah, don\u0027t bother to keep in touch,\u0027 said George, mounting his own. Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd. \u0027It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley--Weasley\u0027s Wizarding Wheezes,\u0027 he said in a loud voice. \u0027Our new premises!\u0027 \u0027Special discounts to Hogwart\u0027s students who swear they\u0027re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,\u0027 added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge. \u0027STOP THEM!\u0027 shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd. \u0027Give her hell from us, Peeves.\u0027 And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-29.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
