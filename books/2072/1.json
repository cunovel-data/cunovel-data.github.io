{"id":111669,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing--for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.\\n\\n He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter\u0027s appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.\\n\\n On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.\\n\\n Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry\u0027s uncle, suddenly spoke.\\n\\n \u0027Glad to see the boy\u0027s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. \u0027Not in the house.\u0027\\n\\n Uncle Vernon grunted.\\n\\n \u0027Watching the news...\u0027 he said scathingly. \u0027I\u0027d like to know what he\u0027s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what\u0027s on the news-- Dudley hasn\u0027t got a clue what\u0027s going on; doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it\u0027s not as if there\u0027d be anything about his lot on our news--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vernon, shh!\u0027 said Aunt Petunia. \u0027The window\u0027s open!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh--yes-- sorry, dear.\u0027\\n\\n The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit \u0027n\u0027 Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon\u0027s voice floated out of the window again.\\n\\n \u0027Dudders out for tea?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027At the Polkisses\u0027,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia fondly. \u0027He\u0027s got so many little friends, he\u0027s so popular...\u0027\\n\\n Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.\\n\\n The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o\u0027clock news reached Harry\u0027s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight--after a month of waiting--would be the night.\\n\\n \u0027Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers\u0027 strike reaches its second week--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Give \u0027em a lifelong siesta, I would,\u0027 snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader\u0027s sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry\u0027s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers.\\n\\n He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again ... and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet....\\n\\n He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles--an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident ... but the baggage-handlers\u0027 strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast (\u0027I hope he\u0027s listening next door!\u0027 bellowed Uncle Vernon. \u0027Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!\u0027), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress\u0027s divorce from her famous husband (\u0027As if we\u0027re interested in their sordid affairs,\u0027 sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).\\n\\n Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, \u0027--and finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more.\u0027\\n\\n Harry opened his eyes. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there would be nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.\\n\\n He had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.\\n\\n A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys\u0027 living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword--but before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys\u0027 open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.\\n\\n Harry felt as though his head had been split in two. Eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.\\n\\n \u0027Put--it--away!\u0027 Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry\u0027s ear. \u0027Now! Before--anyone--sees!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get--off--me!\u0027 Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle\u0027s sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand; then, as the pain in the top of Harry\u0027s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock. Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.\\n\\n Panting, Harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush, straightened up and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.\\n\\n \u0027Lovely evening!\u0027 shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number Seven opposite, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. \u0027Did you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!\u0027\\n\\n He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back towards him.\\n\\n Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon\u0027s outstretched hands could resume their strangling.\\n\\n \u0027What the devil do you mean by it, boy?\u0027 asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury.\\n\\n \u0027What do I mean by what?\u0027 said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.\\n\\n \u0027Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t make that noise,\u0027 said Harry firmly.\\n\\n Aunt Petunia\u0027s thin, horsy face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon\u0027s wide, purple one. She looked livid.\\n\\n \u0027Why were you lurking under our window?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes--yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listening to the news,\u0027 said Harry in a resigned voice.\\n\\n His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\\n\\n \u0027Listening to the news! Again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it changes every day, you see,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you\u0027re really up to--and don\u0027t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Careful, Vernon!\u0027 breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him,\u0027--that your lot don\u0027t get on our news!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all you know,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, \u0027You\u0027re a nasty little liar. What are all those--\u0027 she, too, lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, \u0027--owls doing if they\u0027re not bringing you news?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aha!\u0027 said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. \u0027Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn\u0027t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!\u0027\\n\\n Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting it.\\n\\n \u0027The owls ... aren\u0027t bringing me news,\u0027 he said tonelessly.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe it,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia at once.\\n\\n \u0027No more do I,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\\n\\n \u0027We know you\u0027re up to something funny,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not stupid, you know,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s news to me,\u0027 said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the street.\\n\\n He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.\\n\\n Harry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible.\\n\\n He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia\u0027s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn\u0027t they spoken to him, why hadn\u0027t they made contact, why were they hiding now?\\n\\n And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away.\\n\\n Perhaps it hadn\u0027t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be sure it hadn\u0027t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbour\u0027s house?\\n\\n Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again.\\n\\n Tomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five o\u0027clock so he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet--but was there any point continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.\\n\\n If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he\u0027d had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t say much about you-know-what, obviously....\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray....\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re quite busy but I can\u0027t give you details here....\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s a fair amount going on, we\u0027ll tell you everything when we see you....\u0027\\n\\n But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled I expect we\u0027ll be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron\u0027s parents\u0027 house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at The Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry with them he had thrown away, unopened, the two boxes of Honeydukes chocolates they\u0027d sent him for his birthday. He\u0027d regretted it later, after the wilted salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.\\n\\n And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn\u0027t he, Harry, busy? Hadn\u0027t he proved himself capable of handling much more than them? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn\u0027t it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered, and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed?\\n\\n Don\u0027t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too.\\n\\n He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling. Admittedly, his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione\u0027s, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints:\\n\\n \u0027I know this must be frustrating for you....\u0027 \u0027Keep your nose clean and everything will be OK....\u0027 \u0027Be careful and don\u0027t do anything rash....\u0027\\n\\n Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff....\\n\\n Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys\u0027 flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected ... nothing to worry about ... old news...\\n\\n The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn\u0027t been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And. his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These curious thoughts whirled around in Harry\u0027s head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass, and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings. He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.\\n\\n Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin, Dudley Dursley wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.\\n\\n Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year\u0027s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-school Boxing Champion of the Southeast. \u0027The noble sport\u0027, as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in their primary school days when he had served as Dudley\u0027s first punchball. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didn\u0027t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him--even more terrified than they were of \u0027that Potter boy\u0027, who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan and attended St. Brutus\u0027s Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys.\\n\\n Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. Come on ... look round... I\u0027m sitting here all alone... Come and have a go...\\n\\n If Dudley\u0027s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn\u0027t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he\u0027d be terrified of provoking Harry.... It would be really fun to watch Dudley\u0027s dilemma, to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond ... and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, he was ready--he had his wand. Let them try ... he\u0027d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell--\\n\\n But they didn\u0027t turn around, they didn\u0027t see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.... Seeking a fight was not a smart move.... He must not use magic.... He would be risking expulsion again.\\n\\n The voices of Dudley\u0027s gang died away; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.\\n\\n There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you\u0027d have done...\\n\\n He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and any time after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley ever again, so, stifling a yawn, and still scowling, Harry set off toward the park gate.\\n\\n Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon\u0027s. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his \u0027delinquent\u0027 appearance when he passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley\u0027s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.\\n\\n \u0027...squealed like a pig, didn\u0027t he?\u0027 Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.\\n\\n \u0027Nice right hook, Big D,\u0027 said Piers.\\n\\n \u0027Same time tomorrow?\u0027 said Dudley.\\n\\n \u0027Round at my place, my parents will be out,\u0027 said Gordon.\\n\\n \u0027See you then,\u0027 said Dudley.\\n\\n \u0027Bye, Dud!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027See ya, Big D!\u0027\\n\\n Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Big D!\u0027\\n\\n Dudley turned.\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027It\u0027s you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been \"Big D\" then?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Shut it,\u0027 snarled Dudley, turning away.\\n\\n \u0027Cool name,\u0027 said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside is cousin. \u0027But you\u0027ll always be \"Ickle Diddykins\" to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said, SHUT IT!\u0027 said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t the boys know that\u0027s what your mum calls you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut your face.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t tell her to shut her face. What about \"Popkin\" and \"Dinky Diddydums\", can I use them then?\u0027\\n\\n Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to demand all his self-control.\\n\\n \u0027So who\u0027ve you been beating up tonight?\u0027 Harry asked, his grin fading. \u0027Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was asking for it,\u0027 snarled Dudley.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yeah?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He cheeked me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that\u0027s been taught to walk on its hind legs? \u0027Cause that\u0027s not cheek, Dud, that\u0027s true...\u0027\\n\\n A muscle was twitching in Dudley\u0027s jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.\\n\\n They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a short cut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.\\n\\n \u0027Think you\u0027re a big man carrying that thing, don\u0027t you?\u0027 Dudley said after a few seconds.\\n\\n \u0027What thing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That--that thing you are hiding.\u0027\\n\\n Harry grinned again.\\n\\n \u0027Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s\u0027pose, if you were, you wouldn\u0027t be able to walk and talk at the same time....\u0027\\n\\n Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not allowed,\u0027 Dudley said at once. \u0027I know you\u0027re not. You\u0027d get expelled from that freak school you go to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How d\u0027you know they haven\u0027t changed the rules, Big D?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They haven\u0027t,\u0027 said Dudley, though he didn\u0027t sound completely convinced.\\n\\n Harry laughed softly.\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?\u0027 Dudley snarled.\\n\\n \u0027Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten year old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was sixteen, for your information,\u0027 snarled Dudley, \u0027and he was out cold for twenty minutes after I\u0027d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry\u0027s wand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not this brave at night, are you?\u0027 sneered Dudley.\\n\\n \u0027This is night, Diddykins. That\u0027s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean when you\u0027re in bed!\u0027 Dudley snarled.\\n\\n He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.\\n\\n From the little he could see of Dudley\u0027s large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean, I\u0027m not brave when I\u0027m in bed?\u0027 said Harry, Completely nonplussed. \u0027What--am I supposed to be frightened of, pillows or something?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I heard you last night,\u0027 said Dudley breathlessly. \u0027Talking in your sleep. Moaning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.\\n\\n Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice.\\n\\n \u0027\"Don\u0027t kill Cedric! Don\u0027t kill Cedric!\" Who\u0027s Cedric--your boyfriend?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I--you\u0027re lying,\u0027 said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn\u0027t lying--how else would he know about Cedric?\\n\\n \u0027\"Dad! Help me, Dad! He\u0027s going to kill me, Dad! Boo hoo!\" \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 said Harry quietly. \u0027Shut up, Dudley, I\u0027m warning you!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He\u0027s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He\u0027s going to--\" Don\u0027t you point that thing at me!\u0027\\n\\n Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley\u0027s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years\u0027 hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins--what wouldn\u0027t he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he\u0027d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers--\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t ever talk about that again,\u0027 Harry snarled. \u0027D\u0027you understand me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Point that thing somewhere else!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said, do you understand me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Point it somewhere else!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027GET THAT THING AWAY FROM--\u0027\\n\\n Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water.\\n\\n Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless--the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.\\n\\n For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he\u0027d been resisting as hard as he could--then his reason caught up with his senses--he didn\u0027t have the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil.\\n\\n Dudley\u0027s terrified voice broke in Harry\u0027s ear.\\n\\n \u0027W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not doing anything! Shut up and don\u0027t move!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I c-can\u0027t see! I\u0027ve g-gone blind! I--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said shut up!\u0027\\n\\n Harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up--he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing.\\n\\n It was impossible.... They couldn\u0027t be here.... Not in Little Whinging.... He strained his ears.... He would hear them before he saw them....\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll t-tell Dad!\u0027 Dudley whimpered. \u0027W-where are you? What are you d-do--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you shut up?\u0027 Harry hissed, \u0027I\u0027m trying to lis--\u0027\\n\\n But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading.\\n\\n There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.\\n\\n \u0027C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I\u0027ll h-hit you, I swear I will!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dudley, shut--\u0027\\n\\n WHAM!\\n\\n A fist made contact with the side of Harry\u0027s head, lifting him off his feet. Small white lights popped in front of his eyes. For the second time in an hour Harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; next moment, he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand.\\n\\n \u0027You moron, Dudley!\u0027 Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees, feeling around frantically in the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling.\\n\\n \u0027DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU\u0027RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!\u0027\\n\\n There was a horrible squealing yell and Dudley\u0027s footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.\\n\\n \u0027DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!\u0027 Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. \u0027Where\u0027s--wand--come on--Lumos!\u0027\\n\\n He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search--and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand--the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet and turned around.\\n\\n His stomach turned over.\\n\\n A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.\\n\\n Stumbling backwards, Harry raised his wand.\\n\\n \u0027Expecto patronum!\u0027\\n\\n A silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the Dementor slowed, but the spell hadn\u0027t worked properly; tripping over his own feet, Harry retreated further as the Dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain--concentrate--\\n\\n A pair of grey, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the Dementor\u0027s robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry\u0027s ears.\\n\\n \u0027Expecto patronum!\u0027\\n\\n His voice sounded dim and distant.... Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand--he couldn\u0027t do it any more, he couldn\u0027t work the spell.\\n\\n There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter.... He could smell the Dementor\u0027s putrid, death-cold breath filling his own lungs, drowning him-- Think ... something happy....\\n\\n But there was no happiness in him ... the Dementor\u0027s icy fingers were closing on his throat--the high-patched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head: \u0027Bow to death, Harry.... It might even be painless.... I would not know.... I have never died....\u0027\\n\\n He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again--\\n\\n And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath.\\n\\n \u0027EXPECTO PATRONUM!\u0027\\n\\n An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry\u0027s wand; it\u0027s antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated.\\n\\n \u0027THIS WAY!\u0027 Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. \u0027DUDLEY? DUDLEY!\u0027\\n\\n He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley\u0027s face as though about to kiss him....\\n\\n \u0027GET IT!\u0027 Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor\u0027s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley\u0027s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.\\n\\n Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again.\\n\\n Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a moment, he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.\\n\\n He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging.\\n\\n Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then he heard loud, running footsteps behind him. Instinctively raising his wand again, he span on his heel to face the newcomer.\\n\\n Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbour, came panting into sight. Her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but--\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t put it away, idiot boy!\u0027 she shrieked. \u0027What if there are more of them around? Oh, I\u0027m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-1.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
