{"id":111677,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Harry had a troubled night\u0027s sleep. His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over Kreacher\u0027s dead body, watched by Ron and Hermione who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him. \u0027...better hurry up, Mums going ballistic, she says we\u0027re going to miss the train....\u0027 There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices. \u0027--COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS--\u0027 \u0027--FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS--\u0027 Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered, just as Harry was putting on his trainers. Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms. \u0027Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back\u0027--the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage--\u0027are you ready yet?\u0027 \u0027Nearly--Ginny all right?\u0027 Harry asked, shoving on his glasses. \u0027Mrs. Weasley\u0027s patched her up,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027But now Mad-Eye\u0027s complaining that we can\u0027t leave unless Sturgis Podmore\u0027s here, otherwise the guard will be one short.\u0027 \u0027Guard?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027We have to go to King\u0027s Cross with a guard?\u0027 \u0027You have to go to King\u0027s Cross with a guard,\u0027 Hermione corrected him. \u0027Why?\u0027 said Harry irritably. \u0027I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he\u0027s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s just what Mad-Eye says,\u0027 said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch, \u0027but if we don\u0027t leave soon we\u0027re definitely going to miss the train ....\u0027 \u0027WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!\u0027 Mrs. Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging his trunk. Mrs. Black\u0027s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again, anyway. \u0027Harry, you\u0027re to come with me and Tonks,\u0027 shouted Mrs. Weasley over the repeated screeches of \u0027MUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES OF DIRT!\u0027 \u0027Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor\u0027s going to deal with the luggage.... Oh, for heavens sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!\u0027 A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry\u0027s side as he was clambering over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley. \u0027Oh honestly...\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, \u0027well, on your own head be it!\u0027 She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door slammed behind them and Mrs. Black\u0027s screeches were cut off instantly. \u0027Where\u0027s Tonks?\u0027 Harry said, looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the pavement. \u0027She\u0027s waiting for us just up here,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry. An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork pie. \u0027Wotcher, Harry,\u0027 she said, winking. \u0027Better hurry up, hadn\u0027t we, Molly?\u0027 she added, checking her watch. \u0027I know, I know,\u0027 moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride, \u0027but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis.... If only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again ... but Fudge won\u0027t let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days... How Muggles can stand travelling without magic...\u0027 But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them, snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn\u0027t help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way. It took them twenty minutes to reach King\u0027s Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry\u0027s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and three-quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar.... He was really going back ... \u0027I hope the others make it in time,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come. \u0027Nice dog, Harry!\u0027 called a tall boy with dreadlocks. \u0027Thanks, Lee,\u0027 said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically. \u0027Oh good,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, \u0027here\u0027s Alastor with the luggage, look...\u0027 A porter\u0027s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks. \u0027All okay,\u0027 he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks, \u0027don\u0027t think we were followed....\u0027 Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged on to the platform with Ron and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody\u0027s luggage trolley when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin. \u0027No trouble?\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027I\u0027ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,\u0027 said Moody, \u0027that\u0027s the second time he\u0027s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus.\u0027 \u0027Well, look after yourselves,\u0027 said Lupin, shaking hands all round. He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. \u0027You too, Harry. Be careful.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,\u0027 said Moody, shaking Harry\u0027s hand too. \u0027And don\u0027t forget, all of you--careful what you put in writing. If in doubt, don\u0027t put it in a letter at all.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s been great meeting all of you,\u0027 said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny. \u0027We\u0027ll see you soon, I expect.\u0027 A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train. \u0027Quick, quick,\u0027 said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random and catching Harry twice, \u0027Write.... Be good.... If you\u0027ve forgotten anything we\u0027ll send it on.... Onto the train, now, hurry....\u0027 For one brief moment, the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on Harry\u0027s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved Harry away towards the train door, hissing, \u0027For heaven\u0027s sake, act more like a dog, Sirius!\u0027 \u0027See you!\u0027 Harry called out of the open window as the train began to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, then they rounded a bend, and Sirius was gone. \u0027He shouldn\u0027t have come with us,\u0027 said Hermione in a worried voice. \u0027Oh, lighten up,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027he hasn\u0027t seen daylight for months, poor bloke.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 said Fred, clapping his hands together, \u0027can\u0027t stand around chatting all day, we\u0027ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,\u0027 and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right. The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside the window flashed past, and they swayed where they stood. \u0027Shall we go and find a compartment, then?\u0027 Harry asked. Ron and Hermione exchanged looks. \u0027Er,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027We\u0027re--well--Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,\u0027 Hermione said awkwardly. Ron wasn\u0027t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Right. Fine.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll have to stay there all journey,\u0027 said Hermione quickly. \u0027Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.\u0027 \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Harry again. \u0027Well, I--I might see you later, then.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, definitely,\u0027 said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. \u0027It\u0027s a pain having to go down there, I\u0027d rather--but we have to--I mean, I\u0027m not enjoying it, I\u0027m not Percy,\u0027 he finished defiantly. \u0027I know you\u0027re not,\u0027 said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never travelled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron. \u0027Come on,\u0027 Ginny told him, \u0027if we get a move on we\u0027ll be able to save them places.\u0027 \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry, picking up Hedwig\u0027s cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-panelled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out. After he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories. In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry\u0027s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor. \u0027Hi, Harry,\u0027 he panted. \u0027Hi, Ginny.... Everywhere\u0027s full.... I can\u0027t find a seat....\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. \u0027There\u0027s room in this one, there\u0027s only Loony Lovegood in here--\u0027 Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone. \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 said Ginny, laughing, \u0027she\u0027s all right.\u0027 She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside. Harry and Neville followed. \u0027Hi, Luna,\u0027 said Ginny, \u0027is it okay if we take these seats?\u0027 The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blonde hair, very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of Butterbeer corks, or that she was reading a magazine upside-down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Ginny, smiling at her. Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig\u0027s cage in the luggage rack and sat down. Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadn\u0027t. \u0027Had a good summer, Luna?\u0027 Ginny asked. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. \u0027Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You\u0027re Harry Potter,\u0027 she added. \u0027I know I am,\u0027 said Harry. Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes on him instead. \u0027And I don\u0027t know who you are.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m nobody,\u0027 said Neville hurriedly. \u0027No you\u0027re not,\u0027 said Ginny sharply. \u0027Neville Longbottom--Luna Lovegood. Luna\u0027s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.\u0027 \u0027Wit beyond measure is man\u0027s greatest treasure,\u0027 said Luna in a singsong voice. She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle. The train rattled onwards, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds. \u0027Guess what I got for my birthday?\u0027 said Neville. \u0027Another Remembrall?\u0027 said Harry, remembering the marble-like device Neville\u0027s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory. \u0027No,\u0027 said Neville. \u0027I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago.... No, look at this....\u0027 He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines. \u0027Mimbulus mimbletonia,\u0027 he said proudly. Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ. \u0027It\u0027s really, really rare,\u0027 said Neville, beaming. \u0027I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can\u0027t wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My Great Uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I\u0027m going to see if I can breed from it.\u0027 Harry knew that Neville\u0027s favourite subject was Herbology, but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant. \u0027Does it--er--do anything?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Loads of stuff!\u0027 said Neville proudly. \u0027It\u0027s got an amazing defensive mechanism. Here, hold Trevor for me....\u0027 He dumped the toad into Harry\u0027s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood\u0027s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill. Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant; thick, stinking, dark green jets of it. They hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood\u0027s magazine; Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing Trevor\u0027s escape, received a faceful. It smelled like rancid manure. Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes. \u0027Sosorry,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027I haven\u0027t tried that before.... Didn\u0027t realise it would be quite so... Don\u0027t worry, though, Stinksap\u0027s not poisonous,\u0027 he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful on to the floor. At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open. \u0027Oh ... hello, Harry,\u0027 said a nervous voice. \u0027Um ... bad time?\u0027 Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. \u0027Oh ... hi,\u0027 said Harry blankly. \u0027Um...\u0027 said Cho. \u0027Well ... just thought I\u0027d say hello ... \u0027bye then.\u0027 Rather pink in the face, she closed the door and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap. \u0027Never mind,\u0027 said Ginny bracingly. \u0027Look, we can easily get rid of all this.\u0027 She pulled out her wand. \u0027Scourgify!\u0027 The Stinksap vanished. \u0027Sorry.\u0027 said Neville again, in a small voice. Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog Cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage. \u0027I\u0027m starving,\u0027 said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the frog\u0027s head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning. \u0027Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each house,\u0027 said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \u0027Boy and girl from each.\u0027 \u0027And guess who\u0027s a Slytherin prefect?\u0027 said Ron, still with his eyes closed. \u0027Malfoy,\u0027 replied Harry at once, certain his worst fear would be confirmed. \u0027 \u0027Course,\u0027 said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another. \u0027And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,\u0027 said Hermione viciously. \u0027How she got to be a prefect when she\u0027s thicker than a concussed troll...\u0027 \u0027Who are Hufflepuff\u0027s?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,\u0027 said Ron thickly. \u0027And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,\u0027 said a vague voice. Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his mouthful of Frog. \u0027Yeah, I know I did,\u0027 he said, looking mildly surprised. \u0027She didn\u0027t enjoy it very much,\u0027 Luna informed him. \u0027She doesn\u0027t think you treated her very well, because you wouldn\u0027t dance with her. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have minded,\u0027 she added thoughtfully, \u0027I don\u0027t like dancing very much.\u0027 She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head, bemused, then checked his watch. \u0027We\u0027re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,\u0027 he told Harry and Neville, \u0027and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving. I can\u0027t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something....\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!\u0027 said Hermione sharply. \u0027Yeah, right, because Malfoy won\u0027t abuse it at all,\u0027 said Ron sarcastically. \u0027So you\u0027re going to descend to his level?\u0027 \u0027No, I\u0027m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine.\u0027 \u0027For heavens sake, Ron--\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll make Goyle do lines, it\u0027ll kill him, he hates writing,\u0027 said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle\u0027s low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. \u0027I ... must ... not ... look ... like ... a ... baboon\u0027s ... backside.\u0027 Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing. Luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor. \u0027That was funny!\u0027 Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron\u0027s face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backwards and forwards, clutching her sides. \u0027Are you taking the mickey?\u0027 said Ron, frowning at her. \u0027Baboon\u0027s ... backside!\u0027 she choked, holding her ribs. Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it. Upside-down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but Harry now realised it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; Harry only recognised him because of the lime-green bowler hat. One of Fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts? Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine. CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:How the Tornados are Taking Control SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUINS REVEALED SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim? \u0027Can I have a look at this?\u0027 Harry asked Luna eagerly. She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter. Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index. Until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler. He found the page, and turned excitedly to the article. This, too, was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn\u0027t been captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out. The headline on the article said: SIRIUS--Black As He\u0027s Painted Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation? Harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation? For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. Black\u0027s audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors. BUT DOES HE? Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azhaban. In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may not even have been present at the killings. \u0027What people don\u0027t realise is that Sirius Black is a false name,\u0027 says Mrs. Purkiss. \u0027The man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognised him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn\u0027t possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I have written to the Minister for Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now.\u0027 Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge. Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister for Magic jive years ago. Fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to \u0027cooperate peacefully\u0027 with the guardians of our gold. BUT DOES HE? Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudge\u0027s dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t be the first time, either,\u0027 said a Ministry insider. \u0027Cornelius \"Goblin-Crusher\" Fudge, that\u0027s what his friends call him. If you could hear him when he thinks no one\u0027s listening, oh, he\u0027s always talking about the goblins he\u0027s had done in; he\u0027s had them drowned, he\u0027s had them dropped off buildings, he\u0027s had them poisoned, he\u0027s had them cooked in pies....\u0027 Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing every few pages, he read: an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside-down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy\u0027s ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible. \u0027Anything good in there?\u0027 asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine. \u0027Of course not,\u0027 said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer. \u0027The Quibbler\u0027s rubbish, everyone knows that.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. \u0027My father\u0027s the editor.\u0027 \u0027I--oh,\u0027 said Hermione, looking embarrassed. \u0027Well ... it\u0027s got some interesting ... I mean, it\u0027s quite...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll have it back, thank you,\u0027 said Luna coldly, and leaning forwards she snatched it out of Harry\u0027s hands. Riffling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it resolutely upside-down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time. Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable. \u0027What?\u0027 he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth. \u0027Manners, Potter, or I\u0027ll have to give you a detention,\u0027 drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father\u0027s. \u0027You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.\u0027 Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy\u0027s lip curled. \u0027Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Shut up, Malfoy,\u0027 said Hermione sharply. \u0027I seem to have touched a nerve,\u0027 said Malfoy, smirking. \u0027Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I\u0027ll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.\u0027 \u0027Get out!\u0027 said Hermione, standing up. Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, with Crabbe and Goyle lumbering along in his wake. Hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it. \u0027Chuck us another Frog,\u0027 said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing. Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione, then stared out of the window. He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous.... Hermione had been right.... Sirius should not have come. What if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco? What if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy\u0027s use of the word \u0027dogging\u0027 been a coincidence? The weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows in a half-hearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead. Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy. \u0027We\u0027d better change,\u0027 said Hermione at last, and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes. She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking his reflection in the black window. At last, the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon. \u0027I\u0027ll carry that owl, if you like,\u0027 said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket. \u0027Oh--er--thanks,\u0027 said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig\u0027s more securely into his arms. They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly, they moved towards the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down on to the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of \u0027firs\u0027 years over \u0027ere ... firs\u0027 years...\u0027 But it did not come. Instead, a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling out, \u0027First years line up over here, please! All first years to me!\u0027 A lantern came swinging towards Harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid\u0027s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year. \u0027Where\u0027s Hagrid?\u0027 he said out loud. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Ginny, \u0027but we\u0027d better get out of the way, we\u0027re blocking the door.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yeah...\u0027 Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it--seeing Hagrid again was one of the things he\u0027d been looking forward to most. But there was no sign of him. He can\u0027t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd. He\u0027s just got a cold or something.... He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade Station. Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double-take. The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts. If he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither--vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves. \u0027Where\u0027s Pig?\u0027 said Ron\u0027s voice, right behind Harry. \u0027That Luna girl was carrying him,\u0027 said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid. \u0027Where d\u0027you reckon--\u0027 \u0027--Hagrid is? I dunno,\u0027 said Ron, sounding worried. \u0027He\u0027d better be okay....\u0027 A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second-years out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves. Seconds later, Hermione emerged panting from the crowd. \u0027Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first-year back there. I swear I\u0027m going to report him, he\u0027s only had his badge three minutes and he\u0027s using it to bully people worse than ever.... Where\u0027s Crookshanks?\u0027 \u0027Ginny\u0027s got him,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027There she is....\u0027 Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. \u0027Come on, let\u0027s get a carriage together before they all fill up....\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t got Pig yet!\u0027 Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron. \u0027What are those things, d\u0027you reckon?\u0027 he asked Ron, nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them. \u0027What things?\u0027 \u0027Those horse--\u0027 Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon\u0027s cage in her arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual. \u0027Here you are,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s a sweet little owl, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 \u0027Er ... yeah ... he\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Ron gruffly. \u0027Well, come on then, let\u0027s get in.... What were you saying, Harry?\u0027 \u0027I was saying, what are those horse things?\u0027 Harry said, as he, Ron, and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting. \u0027What horse things?\u0027 \u0027The horse things pulling the carriages!\u0027 said Harry impatiently. They were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look. \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m talking about--look!\u0027 Harry grabbed Ron\u0027s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry. \u0027What am I supposed to be looking at?\u0027 \u0027At the--there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It\u0027s right there in front--\u0027 But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry. \u0027Can\u0027t ... can\u0027t you see them?\u0027 \u0027See what?\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t you see what\u0027s pulling the carriages?\u0027 Ron looked seriously alarmed now. \u0027Are you feeling all right, Harry?\u0027 \u0027I ... yeah...\u0027 Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them, vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet, unless Ron was faking--and it was a very feeble joke if he was--Ron could not see it at all. \u0027Shall we get in, then?\u0027 said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Yeah, go on...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach\u0027s dark interior. \u0027You\u0027re not going mad or anything. I can see them, too.\u0027 \u0027Can you?\u0027 said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Luna, \u0027I\u0027ve been able to see them ever since my first day here. They\u0027ve always pulled the carriages. Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027re just as sane as I am.\u0027 Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-10.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
