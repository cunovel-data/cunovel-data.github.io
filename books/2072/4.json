{"id":111672,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027What\u0027s the Order of the--?\u0027 Harry began. \u0027Not here, boy!\u0027 snarled Moody. \u0027Wait till we\u0027re inside!\u0027 He pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry\u0027s hand and set fire to it with his wand-tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen. \u0027But where\u0027s--?\u0027 \u0027Think about what you\u0027ve just memorised,\u0027 said Lupin quietly. Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn\u0027t felt anything. \u0027Come on, hurry,\u0027 growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back. Harry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialised door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or letterbox. Lupin, pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked open. \u0027Get in quick, Harry,\u0027 Lupin whispered, \u0027but don\u0027t go far inside and don\u0027t touch anything.\u0027 Harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwig\u0027s cage. Moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete. \u0027Here--\u0027 He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted. \u0027Now stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,\u0027 Moody whispered. The others\u0027 hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents. There were hurried footsteps and Ron\u0027s mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her. \u0027Oh, Harry, it\u0027s lovely to see you!\u0027 she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm\u0027s length and examining him critically. \u0027You\u0027re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you\u0027ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I\u0027m afraid....\u0027 She turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, \u0027He\u0027s just arrived, the meeting\u0027s started.\u0027 The wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come. Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held him back. \u0027No, Harry, the meeting\u0027s only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meetings over, then we\u0027ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,\u0027 she added in an urgent whisper. \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want anything to wake up.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you--?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll explain later, I\u0027ve got to hurry, I\u0027m supposed to be at the meeting-- I\u0027ll just show you where you\u0027re sleeping.\u0027 Pressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll\u0027s leg, they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snout-like nose. Harry\u0027s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards? \u0027Mrs. Weasley, why--?\u0027 \u0027Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I\u0027ve really got to dash,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. \u0027There\u0027--they had reached the second landing--\u0027you\u0027re the door on the right. I\u0027ll call you when it\u0027s over.\u0027 And she hurried off downstairs again. Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent\u0027s head, and opened the door. He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room; then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair-- Hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron\u0027s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads. \u0027HARRY! Ron, he\u0027s here, Harry\u0027s here! We didn\u0027t hear you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our letters were useless--but we couldn\u0027t tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn\u0027t, oh, we\u0027ve got so much to tell you, and you\u0027ve got things to tell us--the dementors! When we heard--and that Ministry hearing--it\u0027s just outrageous, I\u0027ve looked it all up, they can\u0027t expel you, they just can\u0027t, there\u0027s provision in the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations--\u0027 \u0027Let him breathe, Hermione,\u0027 said Ron, grinning as he closed the door behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long nose, bright red hair and freckles were the same. Still beaming, Hermione let go of Harry, but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Hedwig!\u0027 The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers. \u0027She\u0027s been in a right state,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this--\u0027 He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut. \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know....\u0027 \u0027We wanted to give them to you, mate,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Hermione was going spare, she kept saying you\u0027d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us--\u0027 \u0027--swear not to tell me,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Yeah, Hermione\u0027s already said.\u0027 The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden--after yearning to see them for a solid month--he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone. There was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others. \u0027He seemed to think it was best,\u0027 said Hermione rather breathlessly. \u0027Dumbledore, I mean.\u0027 \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry. He noticed that her hands, too, bore the marks of Hedwig\u0027s beak and found that he was not at all sorry. \u0027I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles--\u0027 Ron began. \u0027Yeah?\u0027 said Harry, raising his eyebrows. \u0027Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?\u0027 \u0027Well, no--but that\u0027s why he\u0027s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time--\u0027 Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed, except him. \u0027Didn\u0027t work that well, though, did it?\u0027 said Harry, doing his utmost to keep his voice even. \u0027Had to look after myself after all, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027He was so angry,\u0027 said Hermione, in an almost awestruck voice. \u0027Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m glad he left,\u0027 Harry said coldly. \u0027If he hadn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.\u0027 \u0027Aren\u0027t you ... aren\u0027t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?\u0027 said Hermione quietly. \u0027No,\u0027 Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls, and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight snigger. \u0027So why\u0027s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?\u0027 Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. \u0027Did you--er--bother to ask him at all?\u0027 He glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper. \u0027We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027We did, mate. But he\u0027s really busy now, we\u0027ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn\u0027t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted--\u0027 \u0027He could still\u0027ve kept me informed if he\u0027d wanted to,\u0027 Harry said shortly. \u0027You\u0027re not telling me he doesn\u0027t know ways to send messages without owls.\u0027 Hermione glanced at Ron and then said, \u0027I thought that, too. But he didn\u0027t want you to know anything.\u0027 \u0027Maybe he thinks I can\u0027t be trusted,\u0027 said Harry, watching their expressions. \u0027Don\u0027t be thick,\u0027 said Ron, looking highly disconcerted. \u0027Or that I can\u0027t take care of myself.\u0027 \u0027Of course he doesn\u0027t think that!\u0027 said Hermione anxiously. \u0027So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys\u0027 while you two get to join in everything that\u0027s going on here?\u0027 said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word. \u0027How come you two are allowed to know everything that\u0027s going on?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not!\u0027 Ron interrupted. \u0027Mum won\u0027t let us near the meetings, she says we\u0027re too young--\u0027 But before he knew it, Harry was shouting. \u0027SO YOU HAVEN\u0027T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU\u0027VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN\u0027T YOU? YOU\u0027VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I\u0027VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS\u0027 FOR A MONTH! AND I\u0027VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO\u0027VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT-- WHO SAVED THE PHILOSOPHER\u0027S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?\u0027 Every bitter and resentful thought Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him: his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads. \u0027WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM\u003e COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!\u0027 Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, whilst Hermione looked on the verge of tears. \u0027BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT\u0027S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT\u0027S BEEN HAPPENING?\u0027 \u0027Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did--\u0027 Hermione began. \u0027CAN\u0027T\u0027VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU\u0027D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR--\u0027 \u0027Well, he did--\u0027 \u0027FOUR WEEKS I\u0027VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT\u0027S BEEN GOING ON--\u0027 \u0027We wanted to-- \u0027I SUPPOSE YOU\u0027VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN\u0027T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER--\u0027 \u0027No, honest--\u0027 \u0027Harry, we\u0027re really sorry!\u0027 said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. \u0027You\u0027re absolutely right, Harry-- I\u0027d be furious if it was me!\u0027 Harry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry\u0027s feet. \u0027What is this place, anyway?\u0027 he shot at Ron and Hermione. \u0027Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,\u0027 said Ron at once. \u0027Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix--?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a secret society,\u0027 said Hermione quickly. \u0027Dumbledore\u0027s in charge, he founded it. It\u0027s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.\u0027 \u0027Who\u0027s in it?\u0027 said Harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets. \u0027Quite a few people--\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve met about twenty of them,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027but we think there are more.\u0027 Harry glared at them. \u0027Well?\u0027 he demanded, looking from one to the other. \u0027Er,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Well what?\u0027 \u0027Voldemort!\u0027 said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced. \u0027What\u0027s happening? What\u0027s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve told you, the Order don\u0027t let us in on their meetings,\u0027 said Hermione nervously. \u0027So we don\u0027t know the details--but we\u0027ve got a general idea--\u0027 she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry\u0027s face. \u0027Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027They\u0027re really useful.\u0027 \u0027Extendable--?\u0027 \u0027Ears, yeah. Only we\u0027ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realised what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know--\u0027 \u0027--some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order--\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027--and some of them are standing guard over something,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027They\u0027re always talking about guard duty.\u0027 \u0027Couldn\u0027t have been me, could it?\u0027 said Harry sarcastically. \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension. Harry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. \u0027So, what have you two been doing, if you\u0027re not allowed in meetings?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027You said you\u0027d been busy.\u0027 \u0027We have,\u0027 said Hermione quickly. \u0027We\u0027ve been decontaminating this house, it\u0027s been empty for ages and stuff\u0027s been breeding in here. We\u0027ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms and I think we\u0027re doing the drawing room tomo--AARGH!\u0027 With two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron\u0027s elder twin brothers, had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe. \u0027Stop doing that!\u0027 Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter. \u0027Hello, Harry\u0027 said George, beaming at him. \u0027We thought we heard your dulcet tones.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,\u0027 said Fred, also beaming. \u0027There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn\u0027t hear you.\u0027 \u0027You two passed your Apparation tests, then?\u0027 asked Harry grumpily. \u0027With distinction,\u0027 said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-coloured string. \u0027It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Time is Galleons, little brother,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027Anyway, Harry, you\u0027re interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,\u0027 he added in response to Harry\u0027s raised eyebrows, and held up the string which Harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing. \u0027We\u0027re trying to hear what\u0027s going on downstairs.\u0027 \u0027You want to be careful,\u0027 said Ron, staring at the Ear, \u0027if Mum sees one of them again...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s worth the risk, that\u0027s a major meeting they\u0027re having,\u0027 said Fred. The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared. \u0027Oh, hello, Harry!\u0027 said Ron\u0027s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. \u0027I thought I heard your voice.\u0027 Turning to Fred and George, she said, \u0027It\u0027s no-go with the Extendable Ears, she\u0027s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.\u0027 \u0027How d\u0027you know?\u0027 said George, looking crestfallen. \u0027Tonks told me how to find out,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can\u0027t make contact the door\u0027s been Imperturbed. I\u0027ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there\u0027s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.\u0027 Fred heaved a deep sigh. \u0027Shame. I really fancied finding out what old Snape\u0027s been up to.\u0027 \u0027Snape!\u0027 said Harry quickly. \u0027Is he here?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. \u0027Giving a report. Top secret.\u0027 \u0027Git,\u0027 said Fred idly. \u0027He\u0027s on our side now,\u0027 said Hermione reprovingly. Ron snorted. \u0027Doesn\u0027t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees us....\u0027 \u0027Bill doesn\u0027t like him, either,\u0027 said Ginny, as though that settled the matter. Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank on to the bed opposite the others. \u0027Is Bill here?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I thought he was working in Egypt?\u0027 \u0027He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027He says he misses the tombs, but,\u0027 he smirked, \u0027there are compensations....\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 \u0027Remember old Fleur Delacour?\u0027 said George. \u0027She\u0027s got a job at Gringotts to eemprove \u0027er Eeenglish--\u0027 \u0027--and Bill\u0027s been giving her a lot of private lessons,\u0027 sniggered Fred. \u0027Charlie\u0027s in the Order, too,\u0027 said George, \u0027but he\u0027s still in Romania. Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie\u0027s trying to make contacts on his days off.\u0027 \u0027Couldn\u0027t Percy do that?\u0027 Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Co-operation at the Ministry of Magic. At Harry\u0027s words, all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks. \u0027Whatever you do, don\u0027t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,\u0027 Ron told Harry in a tense voice. \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027Because every time Percy\u0027s name\u0027s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he\u0027s holding and Mum starts crying,\u0027 Fred said. \u0027It\u0027s been awful,\u0027 said Ginny sadly. \u0027I think we\u0027re well shot of him,\u0027 said George, with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face. \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Percy and Dad had a row,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It\u0027s normally Mum who shouts....\u0027 \u0027It was the first week back after term ended,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027We were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he\u0027d been promoted.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re kidding?\u0027 said Harry. Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry\u0027s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed it--they all thought Mr. Crouch had gone mad). \u0027Yeah, we were all surprised,\u0027 said George, \u0027because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn\u0027t going to complain....\u0027 \u0027So how come they promoted him?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s exactly what we wondered,\u0027 said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. \u0027He came home really pleased with himself--even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that--and told Dad he\u0027d been offered a position in Fudge\u0027s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts--Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.\u0027 \u0027Only Dad wasn\u0027t,\u0027 said Fred grimly. \u0027Why not?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody\u0027s having any contact with Dumbledore,\u0027 said George. \u0027Dumbledore\u0027s name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027They all think he\u0027s just making trouble saying You-Know-Who\u0027s back.\u0027 \u0027Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who\u0027s in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,\u0027 said George. \u0027Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he\u0027s friendly with Dumbledore, and he\u0027s always thought Dad\u0027s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession.\u0027 \u0027But what\u0027s that got to do with Percy?\u0027 asked Harry, confused. \u0027I\u0027m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family--and Dumbledore.\u0027 Harry let out a low whistle. \u0027Bet Percy loved that.\u0027 Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. \u0027He went completely berserk. He said--well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he\u0027s been having to struggle against Dad\u0027s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad\u0027s got no ambition and that\u0027s why we\u0027ve always been--you know--not had a lot of money, I mean--\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat. \u0027I know,\u0027 said Ron in a low voice. \u0027And it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he--Percy--knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn\u0027t belong to our family any more. And he packed his bags the same night and left. He\u0027s living here in London now.\u0027 Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ron\u0027s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr. Weasley. \u0027Mum\u0027s been in a right state,\u0027 said Ron dully. \u0027You know--crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work--ignores him, I s\u0027pose.\u0027 \u0027But Percy must know Voldemort\u0027s back,\u0027 said Harry slowly. \u0027He\u0027s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn\u0027t risk everything without proof--\u0027 \u0027Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,\u0027 said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. \u0027Percy said the only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... he didn\u0027t think it was good enough.\u0027 \u0027Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,\u0027 said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded. \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 Harry asked, looking around at them all. They were all regarding him warily. \u0027Haven\u0027t--haven\u0027t you been getting the Daily Prophet?\u0027 Hermione asked nervously. \u0027Yeah, I have!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Have you--er-- been reading it thoroughly?\u0027 Hermione asked, still more anxiously. \u0027Not cover to cover,\u0027 said Harry defensively. \u0027If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, \u0027Well, you\u0027d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they--um--they mention you a couple of times a week.\u0027 \u0027But I\u0027d have seen--\u0027 \u0027Not if you\u0027ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Hermione, shaking her head. \u0027I\u0027m not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you\u0027re a standing joke.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you--?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s quite nasty, actually,\u0027 said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. \u0027They\u0027re just building on Rita\u0027s stuff.\u0027 \u0027But she\u0027s not writing for them any more, is she?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no, she\u0027s kept her promise--not that she\u0027s got any choice,\u0027 Hermione added with satisfaction. \u0027But she laid the foundation for what they\u0027re trying to do now.\u0027 \u0027Which is what?\u0027 said Harry impatiently. \u0027OK, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter\u0027s stories about him in a hurry. \u0027Well, they\u0027re writing about you as though you\u0027re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he\u0027s a great tragic hero or something,\u0027 said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. \u0027They keep slipping in snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, \"A tale worthy of Harry Potter\", and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it\u0027s, \"Let\u0027s hope he hasn\u0027t got a scar on his forehead or we\u0027ll be asked to worship him next\"--\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to worship--\u0027 Harry began hotly. \u0027I know you don\u0027t,\u0027 said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. \u0027I know, Harry. But you see what they\u0027re doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I\u0027ll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you\u0027re just some stupid boy who\u0027s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t ask-- I didn\u0027t want-- Voldemort killed my parents!\u0027 Harry spluttered. \u0027I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn\u0027t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don\u0027t they think I\u0027d rather it\u0027d never--\u0027 \u0027We know, Harry,\u0027 said Ginny earnestly. \u0027And of course, they didn\u0027t report a word about the dementors attacking you,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Someone\u0027s told them to keep that quiet. That should\u0027ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven\u0027t even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy. We thought they would, it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off. We think they\u0027re biding their time until you\u0027re expelled, then they\u0027re really going to go to town-- I mean, if you\u0027re expelled, obviously,\u0027 she went on hastily. \u0027You really shouldn\u0027t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there\u0027s no case against you.\u0027 They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. \u0027Uh oh.\u0027 Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway. \u0027The meeting\u0027s over, you can come down and have dinner now. Everyone\u0027s dying to see you, Harry. And who\u0027s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?\u0027 \u0027Crookshanks,\u0027 said Ginny unblushingly. \u0027He loves playing with them.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Mrs Weasley, \u0027I thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don\u0027t forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please....\u0027 Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione. Both of them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed. \u0027Look...\u0027 he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, \u0027We knew you\u0027d be angry, Harry, we really don\u0027t blame you, but you\u0027ve got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore--\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I know,\u0027 said Harry grudgingly. He cast around for a topic that didn\u0027t involve his headmaster, because the very thought of Dumbledore made Harry\u0027s insides burn with anger again. \u0027Who\u0027s Kreacher?\u0027 he asked. \u0027The house-elf who lives here,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Nutter. Never met one like him.\u0027 Hermione frowned at Ron. \u0027He\u0027s not a nutter, Ron--\u0027 \u0027His life\u0027s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother,\u0027 said Ron irritably. \u0027Is that normal, Hermione?\u0027 \u0027Well--well, if he is a bit strange, it\u0027s not his fault--\u0027 Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. \u0027Hermione still hasn\u0027t given up on spew.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not \"spew\"!\u0027 said Hermione heatedly. \u0027It\u0027s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. And it\u0027s not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too--\u0027 \u0027Yeah, yeah,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027C\u0027mon, I\u0027m starving.\u0027 He led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but before they could descend the stairs-- \u0027Hold it!\u0027 Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any further. \u0027They\u0027re still in the hall, we might be able to hear something--\u0027 The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry\u0027s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very centre of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leant further over the banisters. He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix.... A thin piece of flesh-coloured string descended in front of Harry\u0027s eyes. Looking up, he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below. A moment later, however, they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight. \u0027Dammit,\u0027 Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again. They heard the front door open, then close. \u0027Snape never eats here,\u0027 Ron told Harry quietly. \u0027Thank God. C\u0027mon.\u0027 \u0027And don\u0027t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,\u0027 Hermione whispered. As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left. \u0027We\u0027re eating down in the kitchen,\u0027 Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. \u0027Harry, dear, if you\u0027ll just tiptoe across the hall it\u0027s through this door here--\u0027 CRASH. \u0027Tonks!\u0027 cried Mrs. Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her. \u0027I\u0027m sorry!\u0027 wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. \u0027It\u0027s that stupid umbrella stand, that\u0027s the second time I\u0027ve tripped over--\u0027 But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech. The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured--then he realised it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life. The old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell, too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears. Lupin and Mrs Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces. \u0027Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers--\u0027 Tonks apologised over and over again, dragging the huge, heavy troll\u0027s leg back off the floor; Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand; and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry. \u0027Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!\u0027 he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned. The old woman\u0027s face blanched. \u0027Yoooou!\u0027 she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. \u0027Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!\u0027 \u0027I said--shut--UP!\u0027 roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again. The old woman\u0027s screeches died and an echoing silence tell. Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Harry\u0027s godfather Sirius turned to face him. \u0027Hello, Harry,\u0027 he said grimly, \u0027I see you\u0027ve met my mother.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-4.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
