{"id":111699,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\u0027He hasn\u0027t gone!\u0027 Harry yelled. He did not believe it; he would not believe it; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had. Lupin did not understand; people hid behind that curtain; Harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room. Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight-- \u0027SIRIUS!\u0027 he bellowed. \u0027SIRIUS!\u0027 \u0027He can\u0027t come back, Harry,\u0027 said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry. \u0027He can\u0027t come back, because he\u0027s d-- \u0027HE--IS--NOT-- DEAD!\u0027 roared Harry. \u0027SIRIUS!\u0027 There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin should stop pretending that Sirius--who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain--was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to re-enter the battle. Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais. Harry still staring at the archway, was angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting-- But some part of him realised, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before ... Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry to help him ... if Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back ... that he really was-- Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilised by invisible ropes; Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay, and was attempting to revive her; behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts and cries--Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius\u0027s duel with Bellatrix. \u0027Harry?\u0027 Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless. \u0027Harry ... I\u0027b really sorry ...\u0027 said Neville. His legs were still dancing uncontrollably. \u0027Was dad man--was Sirius Black a--a friend of yours?\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Here,\u0027 said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville\u0027s legs he said, \u0027Finite.\u0027 The spell was lifted: Neville\u0027s legs fell back to the floor and remained still. Lupin\u0027s face was pale. \u0027Let\u0027s--let\u0027s find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\u0027 Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as though every word was causing him pain. \u0027Dey\u0027re all back dere,\u0027 said Neville. \u0027A brain addacked Ron bud I dink he\u0027s all righd--and Herbione\u0027s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse--\u0027 There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain: Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it; she was halfway up the steps now -- \u0027Harry--no!\u0027 cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin\u0027s slackened grip. \u0027SHE KILLED SIRIUS!\u0027 bellowed Harry. \u0027SHE KILLED HIM--I\u0027LL KILL HER!\u0027 And he was off, scrambling up the stone benches; people were shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix\u0027s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming ... She aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within: the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long coloured tentacles, but he shouted, \u0027Wingardium Leviosa!\u0027 and they flew off him up into the air. Slipping and sliding, he ran on towards the door; he leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, \u0027Harry--what--?\u0027, past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room; beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts. He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating. Once more, he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra. \u0027Where\u0027s the exit?\u0027 he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. \u0027Where\u0027s the way out?\u0027 The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran ... He could hear a lift clattering ahead; he sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked \u0027Atrium\u0027. The doors slid shut and he was rising ... He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren: the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought-gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening. \u0027Come out, come out, little Harry!\u0027 she called in her mock baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. \u0027What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!\u0027 \u0027I am!\u0027 shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry\u0027s seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room. \u0027Aaaaaah ... did you love him, little baby Potter?\u0027 Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, \u0027Crucio!\u0027 Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had--she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor. \u0027Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?\u0027 she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. \u0027You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain--to enjoy it--righteous anger won\u0027t hurt me for long--I\u0027ll show you how it is done, shall I? I\u0027ll give you a lesson--\u0027 Harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed, \u0027Crucio!\u0027 and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur\u0027s arm, holding its bow, span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard\u0027s head. \u0027Potter, you cannot win against me!\u0027 she cried. He could hear her moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur\u0027s legs, his head level with the house-elf\u0027s. \u0027I was and am the Dark Lord\u0027s most loyal servant. I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete-- \u0027 \u0027Stupefy!\u0027 yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain. She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck. \u0027Protego!\u0027 The jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin\u0027s ears went flying across the room. \u0027Potter, I\u0027m going to give you one chance!\u0027 shouted Bellatrix. \u0027Give me the prophecy--roll it out towards me now--and I may spare your life!\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re going to have to kill me, because it\u0027s gone!\u0027 Harry roared and, as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead; his scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage. \u0027And he knows!\u0027 said Harry, with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix\u0027s own. \u0027Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it\u0027s gone! He\u0027s not going to be happy with you, is he?\u0027 \u0027What? What do you mean?\u0027 she cried, and for the first time there was fear in her voice. \u0027The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think Voldemort\u0027ll say about that, then?\u0027 His scar seared and burned ... the pain of it was making his eyes stream ... \u0027LIAR!\u0027 she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now. \u0027YOU\u0027VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME! Accio prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!\u0027 Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him. \u0027Nothing there!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that!\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 she screamed. \u0027It isn\u0027t true, you\u0027re lying! MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED--DO NOT PUNISH ME--\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t waste your breath!\u0027 yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. \u0027He can\u0027t hear you from here!\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t I, Potter?\u0027 said a high, cold voice. Harry opened his eyes. Tall, thin and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupilled eyes staring ... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move. \u0027So, you smashed my prophecy?\u0027 said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. \u0027No, Bella, he is not lying ... I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind ... months of preparation, months of effort ... and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again ...\u0027 \u0027Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!\u0027 sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort\u0027s feet as he paced slowly nearer. \u0027Master, you should know--\u0027 \u0027Be quiet, Bella,\u0027 said Voldemort dangerously. \u0027I shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your snivelling apologies?\u0027 \u0027But Master--he is here--he is below--\u0027 Voldemort paid no attention. \u0027I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!\u0027 Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor. But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry. \u0027What--?\u0027 cried Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, \u0027Dumbledore!\u0027 Harry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates. Voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak. Next second, he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain. The other statues sprang to life. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backwards, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both. \u0027It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,\u0027 said Dumbledore calmly. \u0027The Aurors are on their way--\u0027 \u0027By which time I shall be gone, and you will be dead!\u0027 spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard\u0027s desk, which burst into flame. Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gong-like note reverberated from it--an oddly chilling sound. \u0027You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\u0027 called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. \u0027Above such brutality, are you?\u0027 \u0027We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,\u0027 Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk towards Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. \u0027Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit--\u0027 \u0027There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\u0027 snarled Voldemort. \u0027You are quite wrong,\u0027 said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless; he wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it. \u0027Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness--\u0027 Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold on Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore. Voldemort vanished; the snake reared from the floor, ready to strike-- There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood. \u0027Look out!\u0027 Harry yelled. But even as he shouted, another jet of green light flew at Dumbledore from Voldemort\u0027s wand and the snake struck-- Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole: he burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long, fluid movement--the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; and the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass. For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass-- Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor. \u0027MASTER!\u0027 screamed Bellatrix. Sure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed: \u0027Stay where you are, Harry!\u0027 For the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why: the hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue, and the baby phoenix Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor--\u0027 Then Harry\u0027s scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance-- He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape-- And when the creature spoke, it used Harry\u0027s mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move ... \u0027Kill me now, Dumbledore ...\u0027 Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again ... \u0027If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy ...\u0027 Let the pain stop, thought Harry ... let him kill us ... end it, Dumbledore ... death is nothing compared to this ... And I\u0027ll see Sirius again ... And as Harry\u0027s heart filled with emotion, the creatures coils loosened, the pain was gone; Harry was lying face down on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood ... And there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been ... Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and raised his head a little to find Dumbledore\u0027s crooked nose inches from his own. \u0027Are you all right, Harry?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly. \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m --where\u0027s Voldemort, where--who are all these--what\u0027s--\u0027 The Atrium was full of people; the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall; and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them. As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin, leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward. \u0027He was there!\u0027 shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before. \u0027I saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!\u0027 \u0027I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!\u0027 gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles. \u0027Merlin\u0027s beard--here--here!-- in the Ministry of Magic!--great heavens above--it doesn\u0027t seem possible--my word--how can this be--?\u0027 \u0027If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,\u0027 said Dumbledore-- apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands; others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor)--\u0027you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.\u0027 \u0027Dumbledore!\u0027 gasped Fudge, beside himself with amazement. \u0027You--here--I--I--\u0027 He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, \u0027Seize him!\u0027 \u0027Cornelius, I am ready to fight your men--and win, again!\u0027 said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. \u0027But a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!\u0027 \u0027I--don\u0027t--well --\u0027 blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody did, he said, \u0027Very well--Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see ... Dumbledore, you--you will need to tell me exactly--the Fountain of Magical Brethren--what happened?\u0027 he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard and centaur now lay scattered. \u0027We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027Harry--Harry Potter?\u0027 Fudge wheeled around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during Dumbledore and Voldemort\u0027s duel. \u0027He--here?\u0027 said Fudge, goggling at Harry. \u0027Why--what\u0027s all this about?\u0027 \u0027I shall explain everything,\u0027 repeated Dumbledore, \u0027when Harry is back at school.\u0027 He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard\u0027s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, \u0027Portus.\u0027 The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more. \u0027Now see here, Dumbledore!\u0027 said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. \u0027You haven\u0027t got authorisation for that Portkey! You can\u0027t do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you--you--\u0027 His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles. \u0027You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you ...\u0027 Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it...\u0027half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the Headmaster will find me.\u0027 Fudge goggled worse than ever; his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair. \u0027I--you--\u0027 Dumbledore turned his back on him. \u0027Take this Portkey, Harry.\u0027 He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand on it, past caring what he did next or where he went. \u0027I shall see you in half an hour,\u0027 said Dumbledore quietly. \u0027One ... two ... three ...\u0027 Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of colour and sound ...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-36.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
