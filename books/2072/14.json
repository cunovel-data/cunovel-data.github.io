{"id":111681,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster\u0027s hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.\\n\\n Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room.\\n\\n Making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione\u0027s elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard ... but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.\\n\\n He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have?\\n\\n He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment.\\n\\n Dear Snuffles,\\n\\n Hope you\u0027re OK, the first week back here\u0027s been terrible, I\u0027m really glad it\u0027s the weekend.\\n\\n We\u0027ve got a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She\u0027s nearly as nice as your mum. I\u0027m writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.\\n\\n We\u0027re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he\u0027ll be back soon.\\n\\n Please write back quickly.\\n\\n Best,\\n\\n Harry\\n\\n Harry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about--or who he was talking to--just from reading this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back. Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.\\n\\n Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully, he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.\\n\\n \u0027I would not go that way if I were you,\u0027 said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of Harry as he walked down the passage. \u0027Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person\u0027s head?\u0027 asked Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Funnily enough, it does,\u0027 said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. \u0027Subtlety has never been Peeves\u0027s strong point. I\u0027m off to try and find the Bloody Baron ... he might be able to put a stop to it ... see you, Harry ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, bye,\u0027 said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last.\\n\\n Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker\u0027s skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not doing anything wrong,\u0027 Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.\\n\\n The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.\\n\\n \u0027There you are,\u0027 he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. \u0027Get down here, I\u0027ve got a letter for you.\u0027\\n\\n With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,\u0027 he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, \u0027but it\u0027s for Sirius, OK?\u0027\\n\\n She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.\\n\\n \u0027Safe flight, then,\u0027 said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid\u0027s hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.\\n\\n The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later ... then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl\u0027s, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.\\n\\n The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Harry automatically.\\n\\n \u0027Oh ... hi,\u0027 she said breathlessly. \u0027I didn\u0027t think anyone would be up here this early ... I only remembered five minutes ago, it\u0027s my mum\u0027s birthday\u0027\\n\\n She held up the parcel.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind.\\n\\n \u0027Nice day,\u0027 he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the weather ...\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. \u0027Good Quidditch conditions. I haven\u0027t been out all week, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.\\n\\n \u0027Hey has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027It\u0027s my friend Ron Weasley, d\u0027you know him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Tornados-hater?\u0027 said Cho rather coolly. \u0027Is he any good?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027I think so. I didn\u0027t see his tryout, though, I was in detention.\u0027\\n\\n Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl\u0027s legs.\\n\\n \u0027That Umbridge woman\u0027s foul,\u0027 she said in a low voice. \u0027Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how--how--how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. You were really brave standing up to her like that.\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s insides re-inflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he had been really brave. For a moment, he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl ... but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.\\n\\n Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.\\n\\n \u0027Aha!\u0027 said Filch, taking a flat-footed step towards Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. \u0027I\u0027ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!\u0027\\n\\n Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.\\n\\n \u0027Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?\u0027\\n\\n Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.\\n\\n \u0027I have my sources.\u0027 said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. \u0027Now hand over whatever it is you\u0027re sending.\u0027\\n\\n Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, \u0027I can\u0027t, it\u0027s gone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gone?\u0027 said Filch, his face contorting with rage.\\n\\n \u0027Gone,\u0027 said Harry calmly.\\n\\n Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry\u0027s robes with his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027How do I know you haven\u0027t got it in your pocket?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saw him send it,\u0027 said Cho angrily.\\n\\n Filch rounded on her.\\n\\n \u0027You saw him--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, I saw him,\u0027 she said fiercely.\\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ...\u0027\\n\\n He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him.\\n\\n Harry and Cho looked at each other.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Harry said.\\n\\n \u0027No problem,\u0027 said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl\u0027s other leg, her face slightly pink. \u0027You weren\u0027t ordering Dungbombs, were you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027I wonder why he thought you were, then?\u0027 she said as she carried the owl to the window.\\n\\n Harry shrugged. He was quite as mystified by that as she was, though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment.\\n\\n They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, \u0027I\u0027m going this way.Well, I\u0027ll ... I\u0027ll see you around, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah ... see you.\u0027\\n\\n She smiled at him and departed. Harry walked on, feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once ... you were really brave standing up to her like that ...Cho had called him brave ... she did not hate him for being alive ...\\n\\n Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that ... though if he\u0027d only asked her to the Ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently ... she had seemed sincerely sorry that she\u0027d had to refuse when Harry asked her ...\\n\\n \u0027Morning,\u0027 Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.\\n\\n \u0027What are you looking so pleased about?\u0027 said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027Erm ... Quidditch later,\u0027 said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him.\\n\\n \u0027Oh ... yeah ...\u0027 said Ron. He put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, \u0027Listen ... you don\u0027t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to--er--give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, OK,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Look, I don\u0027t think you should,\u0027 said Hermione seriously. \u0027You\u0027re both really behind on homework as it--\u0027\\n\\n But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg. Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off.\\n\\n \u0027Anything interesting?\u0027 said Ron. Harry grinned, knowing Ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she sighed, \u0027just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married.\u0027\\n\\n Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon. Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.\\n\\n \u0027Wait a moment,\u0027 said Hermione suddenly. \u0027Oh no ... Sirius!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 said Harry, snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle, with him and Hermione each holding one half.\\n\\n \u0027 \"The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer ... blah blah blah ...is currently hiding in London!\"\u0027Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.\\n\\n \u0027Lucius Malfoy, I\u0027ll bet anything,\u0027 said Harry in a low, furious voice. \u0027He did recognise Sirius on the platform ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Ron, looking alarmed. \u0027You didn\u0027t say--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh!\u0027 said the other two.\\n\\n \u0027... \"Ministry warns wizarding community that Black is very dangerous ... killed thirteen people ... broke out of Azkaban ...\" the usual rubbish,\u0027 Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. \u0027Well, he just won\u0027t be able to leave the house again, that\u0027s all,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Dumbledore did warn him not to.\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madam Malkin\u0027s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.\\n\\n \u0027Hey!\u0027 he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could see it. \u0027Look at this!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got all the robes I want,\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Look ... this little piece here ...\u0027\\n\\n Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was headlined:\\n\\n TRESPASS AT MINISTRY\\n\\n Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o\u0027clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak, in his own defence, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.\\n\\n \u0027Sturgis Podmore?\u0027 said Ron slowly. \u0027He\u0027s that bloke who looks like his head\u0027s been thatched, isn\u0027t he? He\u0027s one of the Ord--\\n\\n \u0027Ron, shh!\u0027 said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.\\n\\n \u0027Six months in Azkaban!\u0027 whispered Harry, shocked. \u0027Just for trying to get through a door!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, it wasn\u0027t just for trying to get through a door. What on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o\u0027clock in the morning?\u0027 breathed Hermione.\\n\\n D\u0027you reckon he was doing something for the Order?\u0027 Ron muttered.\\n\\n \u0027Wait a moment ...\u0027 said Harry slowly. \u0027Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember?\u0027\\n\\n The other two looked at him.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King\u0027s Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn\u0027t turn up; so he couldn\u0027t have been on a job for them, could he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, maybe they didn\u0027t expect him to get caught,\u0027 said Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027It could be a frame-up!\u0027 Ron exclaimed excitedly. \u0027No--listen!\u0027 he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione\u0027s face. \u0027The Ministry suspects he\u0027s one of Dumbledore\u0027s lot so--I dunno--they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn\u0027t trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they\u0027ve just made something up to get him!\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. Harry thought it seemed far-fetched. Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know, I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if that were true.\u0027\\n\\n She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. As Harry laid down his knife and fork, she seemed to come out of a reverie.\\n\\n \u0027Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on self-fertilising shrubs first and if we\u0027re lucky we\u0027ll be able to start McGonagall\u0027s Inanimatus Conjurus Spell before lunch ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week ...\\n\\n \u0027I mean, we can do it tonight,\u0027 said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, and with Hermione\u0027s dire warnings that they would fail all their OWLs still ringing in their ears. \u0027And we\u0027ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that\u0027s her trouble ...\u0027 There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, \u0027D\u0027you think she meant it when she said we weren\u0027t copying from her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I do,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Still, this is important, too, we\u0027ve got to practise if we want to stay on the Quidditch team ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Ron, in a heartened tone. \u0027And we have got plenty of time to do it all ...\u0027\\n\\n As they approached the Quidditch pitch, Harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn\u0027t doing him any harm; he pushed it out of his mind.\\n\\n They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised. After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunch--during which Hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsible--then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Ron?\u0027 said George, winking at him.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch.\\n\\n \u0027Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?\u0027 said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face.\\n\\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood\u0027s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027OK, everyone,\u0027 said Angelina, entering from the Captain\u0027s office, already changed. \u0027Let\u0027s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring out the ball crate for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?\u0027\\n\\n Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that Weasley\u0027s riding?\u0027 Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. \u0027Why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that?\u0027\\n\\n Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.\\n\\n \u0027Ignore them,\u0027 he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron, \u0027we\u0027ll see who\u0027s laughing after we play them ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,\u0027 said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. \u0027OK, everyone, we\u0027re going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Johnson, what\u0027s with that hairstyle, anyway?\u0027 shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. \u0027Why would anyone want to look like they\u0027ve got worms coming out of their head?\u0027\\n\\n Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, \u0027Spread out, then, and let\u0027s see what we can do ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back towards the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.\\n\\n The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted towards the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful.\\n\\n \u0027Pass it on, Ron,\u0027 called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.\\n\\n Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George ...\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Potter, how\u0027s your scar feeling?\u0027 called Malfoy. \u0027Sure you don\u0027t need a lie down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that\u0027s a record for you, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n George passed to Angelina; she reverse-passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.\\n\\n \u0027Come on now, Ron,\u0027 said Angelina crossly, as he dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle. \u0027Pay attention.\u0027\\n\\n It would have been hard to say whether Ron\u0027s face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.\\n\\n On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight though Katie\u0027s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry!\u0027 Ron groaned, zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage.\\n\\n \u0027Get back in position, she\u0027s fine!\u0027 barked Angelina. \u0027But as you\u0027re passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won\u0027t you? We\u0027ve got Bludgers for that!\u0027\\n\\n Katie\u0027s nose was bleeding. Down below, the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.\\n\\n \u0027Here, take this,\u0027 Fred told her, handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket, \u0027it\u0027ll clear it up in no time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 called Angelina, \u0027Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger. Ron, get up to the goalposts. Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We\u0027re going to aim for Ron\u0027s goal, obviously.\u0027\\n\\n Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.\\n\\n \u0027Ron\u0027s making a right pig\u0027s ear of things, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s just nervous,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027he was fine when I was practising with him this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well, I hope he hasn\u0027t peaked too soon,\u0027 said Fred gloomily.\\n\\n They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger. From that moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker\u0027s team and doing so required enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face, and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears ... but too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again.\\n\\n \u0027Stop--stop-- STOP!\u0027 screamed Angelina. \u0027Ron--you\u0027re not covering your middle post!\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked round at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.\\n\\n \u0027Oh ... sorry ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You keep shifting around while you\u0027re watching the Chasers!\u0027 said Angelina. \u0027Either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don\u0027t drift vaguely off to one side, that\u0027s how you let in the last three goals!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry ...\u0027 Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky.\\n\\n \u0027And Katie, can\u0027t you do something about that nosebleed?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just getting worse!\u0027 said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve.\\n\\n Harry glanced round at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it for a second and then look round at Katie, evidently horror-struck.\\n\\n \u0027Well, let\u0027s try again,\u0027 said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of \u0027Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,\u0027 but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless.\\n\\n This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelinas whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.\\n\\n \u0027What now?\u0027 he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.\\n\\n \u0027Katie,\u0027 she said shortly.\\n\\n Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred and George all flying as fast as they could towards Katie. Harry and Alicia sped towards her, too. It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood.\\n\\n \u0027She needs the hospital wing,\u0027 said Angelina.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll take her,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027She--er--might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,\u0027 said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off towards the castle supporting Katie between them. \u0027Come on, let\u0027s go and get changed.\u0027\\n\\n The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms.\\n\\n \u0027How was practice?\u0027 asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.\\n\\n \u0027It was--\u0027 Harry began.\\n\\n \u0027Completely lousy,\u0027 said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frost mess seemed to melt.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it was only your first one,\u0027 she said consolingly, \u0027it\u0027s bound to take time to--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who said it was me who made it lousy?\u0027 snapped Ron.\\n\\n \u0027No one,\u0027 said Hermione, looking taken aback, \u0027I thought--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You thought I was bound to be rubbish?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, of course I didn\u0027t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to get started on some homework,\u0027 said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys\u0027 dormitories and vanished from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Was he lousy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry loyally.\\n\\n Hermione raised her eyebrows.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I suppose he could\u0027ve played better,\u0027 Harry muttered, \u0027but it was only the first training session, like you said ...\u0027\\n\\n Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the \u0027Gryffindor are losers\u0027 chant out of his head.\\n\\n They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in ! heir books while the room around them filled up, then emptied. It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening, Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.\\n\\n \u0027You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\u0027 Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall\u0027s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra\u0027s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter\u0027s many moons.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. \u0027Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she\u0027s done?\u0027\\n\\n Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said heavily, \u0027you know she won\u0027t let us.\u0027\\n\\n And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker. Slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.\\n\\n \u0027Nearly done?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Ron shortly.\\n\\n \u0027Jupiter\u0027s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,\u0027 she said, pointing over Ron\u0027s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, \u0027and it\u0027s Io that\u0027s got the volcanoes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, I only-- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well, if you\u0027ve just come over here to criticise--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ron--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I\u0027m up to my neck in it here-- \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No--look!\u0027\\n\\n Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t that Hermes?\u0027 said Hermione, sounding amazed.\\n\\n \u0027Blimey, it is!\u0027 said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet. \u0027What\u0027s Percy writing to me for?\u0027\\n\\n He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed on Ron\u0027s essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron\u0027s drawing of the moon Io.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s definitely Percy\u0027s handwriting,\u0027 said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other two. \u0027What d\u0027you reckon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Open it!\u0027 said Hermione eagerly, and Harry nodded.\\n\\n Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The further clown the parchment his eyes travelled, the more pronounced became his scowl. When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned towards each other to read it together:\\n\\n Dear Ron,\\n\\n I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister for Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.\\n\\n I was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the \u0027Fred and George\u0027 route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.\\n\\n But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully, you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions.\\n\\n From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this-- no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore\u0027s favourite--but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different--and probably more accurate--view of Potter\u0027s behaviour. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing--and see if you can spot yours truly!\\n\\n Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school, too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality, if you ask me, and many of the people I\u0027ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.\\n\\n It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter--I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent--but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter\u0027s behaviour that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you.\\n\\n This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore\u0027s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that, so far, Professor Umbridge is encountering very little co-operation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week-- again, see the Daily Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this--a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well-placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years!\\n\\n I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticise our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore. (If you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore\u0027s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders.) I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people--the Minister really could not be more gracious to me--and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents\u0027 beliefs and actions, either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realise how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.\\n\\n Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect.\\n\\n Your brother,\\n\\n Percy\\n\\n Harry looked up at Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke, \u0027if you want to--er --what is it?\u0027--he checked Percy\u0027s letter--\u0027Oh yeah--\"sever ties\" with me, I swear I won\u0027t get violent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Give it back,\u0027 said Ron, holding out his hand. \u0027He is--\u0027 Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy\u0027s letter in half \u0027the world\u0027s--\u0027 he tore it into quarters \u0027biggest--\u0027 he tore it into eighths \u0027git.\u0027 He threw the pieces into the fire.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, we\u0027ve got to get this finished sometime before dawn,\u0027 he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra\u0027s essay back towards him.\\n\\n Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, give them here,\u0027 she said abruptly.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Give them to me, I\u0027ll look through them and correct them,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you\u0027re a life-saver,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027what can I--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What you can say is, \"We promise we\u0027ll never leave our homework this late again,\" \u0027 she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly amused all the same.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks a million, Hermione,\u0027 said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.\\n\\n It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermione\u0027s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.\\n\\n He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy\u0027s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the summer holidays, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent.\\n\\n And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation. Nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years ...\\n\\n Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No ... it could not have been ... he had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius ...\\n\\n \u0027OK, write that down,\u0027 Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, \u0027then add this conclusion I\u0027ve written for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I\u0027ve ever met,\u0027 said Ron weakly, \u0027and if I\u0027m ever rude to you again--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--I\u0027ll know you\u0027re back to normal,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Harry, yours is OK except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa\u0027s covered in ice, not mice--Harry?\u0027\\n\\n Harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.\\n\\n \u0027Er--Harry?\u0027 said Ron uncertainly. \u0027Why are you down there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because I\u0027ve just seen Sirius\u0027s head in the fire,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius\u0027s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it, too; nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time ... it had vanished so quickly ...\\n\\n \u0027Sirius\u0027s head?\u0027 Hermione repeated. \u0027You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn\u0027t do that now, it would be too--Sirius!\u0027\\n\\n She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius\u0027s head, long dark hair failing around his grinning face.\\n\\n \u0027I was starting to think you\u0027d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve been checking every hour.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve been popping into the fire every hour?\u0027 Harry said, half-laughing.\\n\\n \u0027Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what if you\u0027d been seen?\u0027 said Hermione anxiously.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I think a girl--first-year, by the look of her--might\u0027ve get a glimpse of me earlier, but don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth, \u0027I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I\u0027ll bet she just thought I was an oddly-shaped log or something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But, Sirius, this is taking an awful risk--\u0027 Hermione began.\\n\\n \u0027You sound like Molly,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry\u0027s letter without resorting to a code--and codes are breakable.\u0027\\n\\n At the mention of Harry\u0027s letter, Hermione and Ron both turned to stare at him.\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t say you\u0027d written to Sirius! said Hermione accusingly.\\n\\n \u0027I forgot,\u0027 said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind. \u0027Don\u0027t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, it was very good,\u0027 said Sirius, smiling. \u0027Anyway, we\u0027d better be quick, just in case we\u0027re disturbed--your scar.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about--?\u0027 Ron began, but Hermione interrupted him.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll tell you afterwards. Go on, Sirius.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I know it can\u0027t be fun when it hurts, but we don\u0027t think its anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,\u0027 said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione\u0027s winces. \u0027So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, now he\u0027s back it\u0027s bound to hurt more often,\u0027 said Sirius.\\n\\n \u0027So you don\u0027t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her?\u0027 Harry asked.\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027I know her by reputation and I\u0027m sure she\u0027s no Death Eater--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s foul enough to be one,\u0027 said Harry darkly, and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but the world isn\u0027t split into good people and Death Eaters,\u0027 said Sirius with a wry smile. \u0027I know she\u0027s a nasty piece of work, though--you should hear Remus talk about her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does Lupin know her?\u0027 asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge\u0027s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first lesson.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.\u0027\\n\\n Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s she got against werewolves?\u0027 said Hermione angrily.\\n\\n \u0027Scared of them, I expect,\u0027 said Sirius, smiling at her indignation. \u0027Apparently, she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year, too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose.\u0027\\n\\n Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.\\n\\n \u0027Sirius!\u0027 she said reproachfully. \u0027Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d respond. After all, you are the only member of his family he\u0027s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, what are Umbridge\u0027s lessons like?\u0027 Sirius interrupted. \u0027Is she training you all to kill half-breeds?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, ignoring Hermione\u0027s affronted look at being cut off in her defence of Kreacher. \u0027She\u0027s not letting us use magic at all!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All we do is read the stupid textbook,\u0027 said Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, well, that figures,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn\u0027t want you trained in combat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trained in combat!\u0027 repeated Harry incredulously. \u0027What does he think we\u0027re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s exactly what he thinks you\u0027re doing,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027or, rather, that\u0027s exactly what he\u0027s afraid Dumbledore\u0027s doing--forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause at this, then Ron said, That\u0027s the most stupid thing I\u0027ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So we\u0027re being prevented from learning Defence Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we\u0027ll use spells against the Ministry?\u0027 said Hermione, looking furious.\\n\\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Sirius. \u0027Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. He\u0027s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It\u0027s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge.\u0027\\n\\n This reminded Harry of Percy\u0027s letter.\\n\\n \u0027D\u0027you know if there\u0027s going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Ron\u0027s brother Percy reckons there will be--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027I haven\u0027t seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they\u0027re all busy. It\u0027s just been Kreacher and me here.\u0027\\n\\n There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \u0027So you haven\u0027t had any news about Hagrid, either?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah ...\u0027 said Sirius, \u0027well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one\u0027s sure what\u0027s happened to him.\u0027 Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, \u0027But Dumbledore\u0027s not worried, so don\u0027t you three get yourselves in a state; I\u0027m sure Hagrid\u0027s fine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if he was supposed to be back by now ...\u0027 said Hermione in a small, anxious voice.\\n\\n \u0027Madame Maxime was with him, we\u0027ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home--but there\u0027s nothing to suggest he\u0027s hurt or--well, nothing to suggest he\u0027s not perfectly OK.\u0027\\n\\n Unconvinced, Harry, Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks.\\n\\n \u0027Listen, don\u0027t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,\u0027 said Sirius hastily, \u0027it\u0027ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he\u0027s not back and I know Dumbledore doesn\u0027t want that. Hagrid\u0027s tough, he\u0027ll be OK.\u0027 And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, \u0027When\u0027s your next Hogsmeade weekend, anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn\u0027t we? I thought I could--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027NO!\u0027 said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.\\n\\n \u0027Sirius, didn\u0027t you see the Daily Prophet?\u0027 said Hermione anxiously.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that,\u0027 said Sirius, grinning, \u0027they\u0027re always guessing where I am, they haven\u0027t really got a clue--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but we think this time they have,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius-- you know, Lucius Malfoy--so don\u0027t come up here, whatever you do. If Malfoy recognises you again--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right, I\u0027ve got the point,\u0027 said Sirius. He looked most displeased. \u0027Just an idea, thought you might like to get together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I would, I just don\u0027t want you chucked back in Azkaban!\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re less like your father than I thought,\u0027 he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. \u0027The risk would\u0027ve been what made it fun for James.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,\u0027 said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. \u0027I\u0027ll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?\u0027\\n\\n There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius\u0027s head had been was flickering flame once more. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-14.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
