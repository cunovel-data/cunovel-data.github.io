{"id":111686,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Harry sprinted up to the boys\u0027 dormitories to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder\u0027s Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls\u0027 dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats. \u0027Well, it\u0027s cold out there!\u0027 she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently. They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak--Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing--then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check on the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Morris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027. They crept across the Entrance Hall and out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid\u0027s chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him. They crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door. When Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside. \u0027Hagrid, it\u0027s us!\u0027 Harry called through the keyhole. \u0027Shoulda known!\u0027 said a gruff voice. They beamed at each other under the Cloak; they could tell by Hagrid\u0027s voice that he was pleased. \u0027Bin home three seconds ... out the way, Fang ... out the way, yeh dozy dog ...\u0027 The bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open and Hagrid\u0027s head appeared in the gap. Hermione screamed. \u0027Merlin\u0027s beard, keep it down!\u0027 said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \u0027Under that Cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry!\u0027 Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them. \u0027I just--oh, Hagrid!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s nuthin\u0027, it\u0027s nuthin\u0027!\u0027 said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror. Hagrid\u0027s hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple and black bruising. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home: a thick black travelling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it. \u0027What happened to you?\u0027 Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces. \u0027Told yeh, nuthin\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid firmly. \u0027Want a cuppa?\u0027 \u0027Come off it,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027you\u0027re in a right state!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m tellin\u0027 yeh, I\u0027m fine,\u0027 said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \u0027Blimey, it\u0027s good ter see yeh three again--had good summers, did yeh?\u0027 \u0027Hagrid, you\u0027ve been attacked!\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Fer the las\u0027 time, it\u0027s nuthin\u0027!\u0027 said Hagrid firmly. \u0027Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\u0027 Ron demanded. \u0027You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\u0027 said Hermione anxiously, \u0027some of those cuts look nasty.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m dealin\u0027 with it, all righ?\u0027 said Hagrid repressively. He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tyre. \u0027You\u0027re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\u0027 said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \u0027It looks poisonous.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s s\u0027posed ter look like that, it\u0027s dragon meat,\u0027 Hagrid said. \u0027An\u0027 I didn\u0027 get it ter eat.\u0027 He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction. \u0027Tha\u0027s better. It helps with the stingin\u0027, yeh know.\u0027 \u0027So, are you going to tell us what\u0027s happened to you?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027Can\u0027t, Harry. Top secret. More\u0027n me job\u0027s worth ter tell yeh that.\u0027 \u0027Did the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\u0027 asked Hermione quietly. Hagrid\u0027s fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily on to his chest. \u0027Giants?\u0027 said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face, \u0027who said anythin\u0027 abou\u0027 giants? Who yeh bin talkin\u0027 to? Who\u0027s told yeh what I\u0027ve--who\u0027s said I\u0027ve bin--eh?\u0027 \u0027We guessed,\u0027 said Hermione apologetically. \u0027Oh, yeh did, did yeh?\u0027 said Hagrid, surveying her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak. \u0027It was kind of ... obvious,\u0027 said Ron. Harry nodded. Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak back on to the table and strode over to the kettle, which was now whistling. \u0027Never known kids like you three fer knowin\u0027 more\u0027n yeh oughta,\u0027 he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \u0027An\u0027 I\u0027m not complimentin\u0027 yeh, neither. Nosy, some\u0027d call it. Interferin\u0027.\u0027 But his beard twitched. \u0027So you have been to look for giants?\u0027 said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table. Hagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face. \u0027Yeah, all righ\u0027,\u0027 he grunted, \u0027I have.\u0027 \u0027And you found them?\u0027 said Hermione in a hushed voice. \u0027Well, they\u0027re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest, said Hagrid. \u0027Pretty big, see.\u0027 \u0027Where are they?\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Mountains,\u0027 said Hagrid unhelpfully. \u0027So why don\u0027t Muggles--?\u0027 \u0027They do,\u0027 said Hagrid darkly. \u0027On\u0027y their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin\u0027 accidents, aren\u0027 they?\u0027 He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising. \u0027Come on, Hagrid, tell us what you\u0027ve been up to!\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors--\u0027 Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, on to the floor. \u0027Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\u0027 growled Hagrid. \u0027Didn\u0027t you know?\u0027 Hermione asked him, wide-eyed. \u0027I don\u0027 know any thin\u0027 that\u0027s bin happenin\u0027 since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn\u0027 I, didn\u0027 wan\u0027 owls followin\u0027 me all over the place--ruddy dementors! Yeh\u0027re not serious?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me--\u0027 \u0027WHAT?\u0027 \u0027--and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\u0027 \u0027You were expelled!\u0027 \u0027Tell us about your summer and I\u0027ll tell you about mine.\u0027 Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face. \u0027Oh, all righ\u0027,\u0027 Hagrid said in a resigned voice. He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang\u0027s mouth. \u0027Oh, Hagrid, don\u0027t, it\u0027s not hygien--\u0027 Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea, then said, \u0027Well, we set off righ\u0027 after term ended--\u0027 \u0027Madame Maxime went with you, then?\u0027 Hermione interjected. \u0027Yeah, tha\u0027s righ\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \u0027Yeah, it was jus\u0027 the pair of us. An\u0027 I\u0027ll tell yeh this, she\u0027s not afraid of roughin\u0027 it, Olympe. Yeh know, she\u0027s a fine, well-dressed woman, an\u0027 knowin\u0027 where we was goin\u0027 I wondered \u0027ow she\u0027d feel abou\u0027 clamberin\u0027 over boulders an\u0027 sleepin\u0027 in caves an\u0027 tha\u0027, bu\u0027 she never complained once.\u0027 \u0027You knew where you were going?\u0027 Harry repeated. \u0027You knew where the giants were?\u0027 \u0027Well, Durnbledore knew, an\u0027 he told us,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Are they hidden?\u0027 asked Ron. \u0027Is it a secret, where they are?\u0027 \u0027Not really,\u0027 said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \u0027It\u0027s jus\u0027 that mos\u0027 wizards aren\u0027 bothered where they are, \u0027s\u0027long as it\u0027s a good long way away. But where they are\u0027s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore\u0027s instructions. Took us abou\u0027 a month ter get there--\u0027 \u0027A month?\u0027 said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \u0027But--why couldn\u0027t you just grab a Portkey or something?\u0027 There was an odd expression in Hagrid\u0027s unobscured eye as he surveyed Ron; it was almost pitying. \u0027We\u0027re bein\u0027 watched, Ron,\u0027 he said gruffly. \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 \u0027Yeh don\u0027 understand,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027The Ministry\u0027s keepin\u0027 an eye on Dumbledore an\u0027 anyone they reckon\u0027s in league with \u0027im, an\u0027--\u0027 \u0027We know about that,\u0027 said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid\u0027s story, \u0027we know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore--\u0027 \u0027So you couldn\u0027t use magic to get there?\u0027 asked Ron, looking thunderstruck, \u0027you had to act like Muggles all the way?\u0027 \u0027Well, not exactly all the way,\u0027 said Hagrid cagily. \u0027We jus\u0027 had ter be careful, \u0027cause Olympe an\u0027 me, we stick out a bit--\u0027 Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea. \u0027--so we\u0027re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin\u0027 we was goin\u0027 on holiday together, so we got inter France an\u0027 we made like we was headin\u0027 fer where Olympe\u0027s school is, \u0027cause we knew we was bein\u0027 tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, \u0027cause I\u0027m not really s\u0027posed ter use magic an\u0027 we knew the Ministry\u0027d be lookin\u0027 fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin\u0027 us the slip round abou\u0027 Dee-John--\u0027 \u0027Ooooh, Dijon?\u0027 said Hermione excitedly. \u0027I\u0027ve been there on holiday, did you see--?\u0027 She fell silent at the look on Ron\u0027s face. \u0027We chanced a bit o\u0027 magic after that an\u0027 it wasn\u0027 a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o\u0027 mad trolls on the Polish border an\u0027 I had a sligh\u0027 disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, bu\u0027 apart from tha\u0027 couldn\u0027t\u0027a bin smoother. \u0027An\u0027 then we reached the place, an\u0027 we started trekkin\u0027 up through the mountains, lookin\u0027 fer signs of \u0027em ... \u0027We had ter lay off the magic once we got near \u0027em. Partly \u0027cause they don\u0027 like wizards an\u0027 we didn\u0027 want ter put their backs up too soon, an\u0027 partly \u0027cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an\u0027 all. Said it was odds on he\u0027d sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin\u0027 attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\u0027 Hagrid paused for a long draught of tea. \u0027Go on!\u0027 said Harry urgently. \u0027Found \u0027em,\u0027 said Hagrid baldly. \u0027Went over a ridge one nigh\u0027 an\u0027 there they was, spread ou\u0027 underneath us. Little fires burnin\u0027 below an\u0027 huge shadows ... it was like watchin\u0027 bits o\u0027 the mountain movin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027How big are they?\u0027 asked Ron in a hushed voice. \u0027 \u0027Bout twenty feet,\u0027 said Hagrid casually. \u0027Some o\u0027 the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\u0027 \u0027And how many were there?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027I reckon abou\u0027 seventy or eighty,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Is that all?\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Hagrid sadly, \u0027eighty left, an\u0027 there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff\u0027rent tribes from all over the world. Bu\u0027 they\u0027ve bin dyin\u0027 out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o\u0027 course, bu\u0027 mostly they killed each other, an\u0027 now they\u0027re dyin\u0027 out faster than ever. They\u0027re not made ter live bunched up together like tha\u0027. Dumbledore says it\u0027s our fault, it was the wizards who forced \u0027em to go an\u0027 made \u0027em live a good long way from us an\u0027 they had no choice bu\u0027 ter stick together fer their own protection.\u0027 \u0027So,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027you saw them and then what?\u0027 \u0027Well, we waited till morning, didn\u0027 want ter go sneakin\u0027 up on \u0027em in the dark, fer our own safety,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027 \u0027Bout three in the mornin\u0027 they fell asleep jus\u0027 where they was sittin\u0027. We didn\u0027 dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of \u0027em woke up an\u0027 came up where we were, an\u0027 fer another, the snorin\u0027 was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin\u0027. \u0027Anyway once it was light we wen\u0027 down ter see \u0027em.\u0027 \u0027Just like that?\u0027 said Ron, looking awestruck. \u0027You just walked right into a giant camp?\u0027 \u0027Well, Dumbledore\u0027d told us how ter do it,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\u0027 \u0027Give the what gifts?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027Oh, the Gurg-- means the chief.\u0027 \u0027How could you tell which one was the Gurg?\u0027 asked Ron. Hagrid grunted in amusement. \u0027No problem,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was the biggest, the ugliest and the laziest. Sittin\u0027 there waitin\u0027 ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an\u0027 such like. Name o\u0027 Karkus. I\u0027d put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet an\u0027 the weight o\u0027 a couple o\u0027 bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an\u0027 all.\u0027 \u0027And you just walked up to him?\u0027 said Hermione breathlessly. \u0027Well ... down ter him, where he was lyin\u0027 in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an\u0027 Karkus was lyin\u0027 by the lake roarin\u0027 at the others ter feed him an\u0027 his wife. Olympe an\u0027 I went down the mountainside--\u0027 \u0027But didn\u0027t they try and kill you when they saw you?\u0027 asked Ron incredulously. \u0027It was def\u0027nitely on some o\u0027 their minds,\u0027 said Hagrid, shrugging, \u0027but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an\u0027 keep our eyes on the Gurg an\u0027 ignore the others. So tha\u0027s what we did. An\u0027 the rest of \u0027em went quiet an\u0027 watched us pass an\u0027 we got right up ter Karkuss leet an we bowed an\u0027 put our present down in front o\u0027 him.\u0027 \u0027What do you give a giant?\u0027 asked Ron eagerly. \u0027Food?\u0027 \u0027Nah, he can get food all righ\u0027 fer himself,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027We took him magic. Giants like magic, jus\u0027 don\u0027 like us usin\u0027 it against \u0027em. Anyway, that firs\u0027 day we gave \u0027im a branch o\u0027 Gubraithian fire.\u0027 Hermione said, \u0027Wow!\u0027 softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement. \u0027A branch of--?\u0027 \u0027Everlasting fire,\u0027 said Hermione irritably, \u0027you ought to know that by now. Professor Flitwick\u0027s mentioned it at least twice in class!\u0027 \u0027Well, anyway,\u0027 said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \u0027Dumbledore\u0027d bewitched this branch to burn fer evermore, which isn\u0027 somethin\u0027 any wizard could do, an\u0027 so I lies it down in the snow by Karkuss feet and says, \"A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.\" \u0027 \u0027And what did Karkus say?\u0027 asked Harry eagerly. \u0027Nothin\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Didn\u0027 speak English.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re kidding!\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027 matter,\u0027 said Hagrid imperturbably, \u0027Dumbledore had warned us tha\u0027 migh\u0027 happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o\u0027 giants who knew our lingo an\u0027 they translated fer us.\u0027 \u0027And did he like the present?\u0027 asked Ron. \u0027Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\u0027 said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye. \u0027Very pleased. So then I said, \"Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.\" \u0027 \u0027Why couldn\u0027t you speak to them that day?\u0027 asked Hermione. \u0027Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Let \u0027em see we kept our promises. We\u0027ll come back tomorrow with another present, an\u0027 then we do come back with another present--gives a good impression, see? An\u0027 gives them time ter test out the firs\u0027 present an\u0027 fnd out it\u0027s a good one, an\u0027 get \u0027em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus--overload \u0027em with information an\u0027 they\u0027ll kill yeh jus\u0027 to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an\u0027 went off an\u0027 found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an\u0027 the followin\u0027 mornin\u0027 we went back an\u0027 this time we found Karkus sittin\u0027 up waitin\u0027 fer us lookin\u0027 all eager.\u0027 \u0027And you talked to him?\u0027 \u0027Oh yeah. Firs\u0027 we presented him with a nice battle helmet--goblin-made an\u0027 indestructible, yeh know--an\u0027 then we sat down an\u0027 we talked.\u0027 \u0027What did he say?\u0027 \u0027Not much,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Listened mostly. Bu\u0027 there were good signs. He\u0027d heard o\u0027 Dumbledore, heard he\u0027d argued against the killin\u0027 o\u0027 the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int\u0027rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An\u0027 a few o\u0027 the others, \u0027specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an\u0027 listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next mornin\u0027 with another present. \u0027Bu\u0027 that night it all wen\u0027 wrong.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 said Ron quickly. \u0027Well, like I say, they\u0027re not meant ter live together, giants,\u0027 said Hagrid sadly. \u0027Not in big groups like that. They can\u0027 help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an\u0027 the women fight each other; the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an\u0027 that\u0027s even without squabbles over food an\u0027 the best fires an\u0027 sleepin\u0027 spots. Yeh\u0027d think, seein\u0027 as how their whole race is abou\u0027 finished, they\u0027d lay off each other, bu\u0027 ...\u0027 Hagrid sighed deeply. \u0027That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin\u0027 down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn\u0027 believe the noise. An\u0027 when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an\u0027 his head was lyin\u0027 at the bottom o\u0027 the lake.\u0027 \u0027Whose head?\u0027 gasped Hermione. \u0027Karkus\u0027s,\u0027 said Hagrid heavily. \u0027There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\u0027 He sighed deeply. \u0027Well, we hadn\u0027 bargained on a new Gurg two days after we\u0027d made friendly contact with the firs\u0027 one, an\u0027 we had a funny feelin\u0027 Golgomath wouldn\u0027 be so keen ter listen to us, bu\u0027 we had ter try.\u0027 \u0027You went to speak to him?\u0027 asked Ron incredulously. \u0027After you\u0027d watched him rip off another giant\u0027s head?\u0027 \u0027Course we did,\u0027 said Hagrid, \u0027we hadn\u0027 gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen\u0027 down with the next present we\u0027d meant ter give ter Karkus. \u0027I knew it was no go before I\u0027d opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin\u0027 Karkus\u0027s helmet, leerin\u0027 at us as we got nearer. He\u0027s massive, one o\u0027 the biggest ones there. Black hair an\u0027 matchin\u0027 teeth an\u0027 a necklace o\u0027 bones. Human-lookin\u0027 bones, some of \u0027em. Well, I gave it a go--held out a great roll o\u0027 dragon skin--an\u0027 said, \"A gift fer the Gurg of the giants--\u0027\" Nex\u0027 thing I knew, I was hangin\u0027 upside-down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\u0027 Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth. \u0027How did you get out of that?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027Wouldn\u0027ta done if Olympe hadn\u0027 bin there,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027She pulled out her wand an\u0027 did some o\u0027 the fastes\u0027 spellwork I\u0027ve ever seen. Ruddy marvellous. Hit the two holdin\u0027 me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an\u0027 they dropped me straightaway--\u0027bu\u0027 we were in trouble then, \u0027cause we\u0027d used magic against \u0027em, an\u0027 that\u0027s what giants hate abou\u0027 wizards. We had ter leg it an\u0027 we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter the camp again.\u0027 \u0027Blimey, Hagrid,\u0027 said Ron quietly. \u0027So, how come it\u0027s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\u0027 asked Hermione. \u0027We didn\u0027 leave after three days!\u0027 said Hagrid, looking outraged. \u0027Dumbledore was relyin\u0027 on us!\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027ve just said there was no way you could go back!\u0027 \u0027Not by daylight we couldn\u0027, no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o\u0027 days lyin\u0027 low up in the cave an\u0027 watchin\u0027. An\u0027 wha\u0027 we saw wasn\u0027 good.\u0027 \u0027Did he rip off more heads?\u0027 asked Hermione, sounding squeamish. \u0027No,\u0027 said Hagrid, \u0027I wish he had.\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean?\u0027 \u0027I mean we soon found out he didn\u0027 object ter all wizards--\u0027just us.\u0027 \u0027Death Eaters?\u0027 said Harry quickly. \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Hagrid darkly. \u0027Couple oi \u0027em were visitin\u0027 him ev\u0027ry day, bringin\u0027 gifts ter the Gurg, an\u0027 he wasn\u0027 dangling them upside-down.\u0027 \u0027How d\u0027you know they were Death Eaters?\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Because I recognised one of \u0027em,\u0027 Hagrid growled. \u0027Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin\u0027 as much as Golgomath; no wonder they were gettin\u0027 on so well.\u0027 \u0027So Macnair\u0027s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\u0027 said Hermione desperately. \u0027Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven\u0027 finished me story yet!\u0027 said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \u0027Me an\u0027 Olympe talked it over an\u0027 we agreed, jus\u0027 \u0027cause the Gurg looked like favourin\u0027 You-Know-Who didn\u0027 mean all of \u0027em would. We had ter try an\u0027 persuade some o\u0027 the others, the ones who hadn\u0027 wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\u0027 \u0027How could you tell which ones they were?\u0027 asked Ron. \u0027Well, they were the ones bein\u0027 beaten to a pulp, weren\u0027 they?\u0027 said Hagrid patiently. \u0027The ones with any sense were keepin\u0027 outta Golgomath\u0027s way, hidin\u0027 out in caves roun\u0027 the gully jus\u0027 like we were. So we decided we\u0027d go pokin\u0027 round the caves by night an\u0027 see if we couldn\u0027 persuade a few o\u0027 them.\u0027 \u0027You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\u0027 said Ron, with awed respect in his voice. \u0027Well, it wasn\u0027 the giants who worried us most,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027We were more concerned abou\u0027 the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen\u0027 not ter tangle with \u0027em if we could avoid it, an\u0027 the trouble was they knew we was around--\u0027spect Golgomath told \u0027em abou\u0027 us. At night, when the giants were sleepin\u0027 an\u0027 we wanted ter be creepin\u0027 inter the caves, Macnair an\u0027 the other one were sneakin\u0027 round the mountains lookin\u0027 fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin\u0027 out at \u0027em,\u0027 said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard, \u0027she was rarin\u0027 ter attack \u0027em ... she\u0027s somethin\u0027 when she\u0027s roused, Olympe ... fiery, yeh know ...\u0027spect it\u0027s the French in her ...\u0027 Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. \u0027So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\u0027 \u0027What? Oh ... oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we\u0027d bin hidin\u0027 in an\u0027 headed back down inter the gully, keepin\u0027 our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o\u0027 the caves, no go-- then, in abou\u0027 the sixth one, we found three giants hidin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027Cave must\u0027ve been cramped,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Wasn\u0027 room ter swing a Kneazle,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027Didn\u0027t they attack you when they saw you?\u0027 asked Hermione. \u0027Probably woulda done if they\u0027d bin in any condition,\u0027 said Hagrid, \u0027but they was badly hurt, all three o\u0027 them; Golgomath\u0027s lot had beaten \u0027em unconscious; they\u0027d woken up an\u0027 crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o\u0027 them had a bit of English an\u0027 \u0027e translated fer the others, an\u0027 what we had ter say didn\u0027 seem ter go down too badly. So we kep\u0027 goin\u0027 back, visitin\u0027 the wounded ... I reckon we had abou\u0027 six or seven o\u0027 them convinced at one poin\u0027.\u0027 \u0027Six or seven?\u0027 said Ron eagerly. \u0027Well that\u0027s not bad--are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\u0027 But Hermione said, \u0027What do you mean \"at one point\", Hagrid?\u0027 Hagrid looked at her sadly. \u0027Golgomath\u0027s lot raided the caves. The ones tha\u0027 survived didn\u0027 wan\u0027 no more ter to do with us after that.\u0027 \u0027So ... so there aren\u0027t any giants coming?\u0027 said Ron, looking disappointed. \u0027Nope,\u0027 said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, \u0027but we did wha\u0027 we meant ter do, we gave \u0027em Dumbledore\u0027s message an\u0027 some o\u0027 them heard it an\u0027 I spect some o\u0027 them\u0027ll remember it. Jus\u0027 maybe, them that don\u0027 want ter stay around Golgomath\u0027ll move outta the mountains, an\u0027 there\u0027s gotta be a chance they\u0027ll remember Dumbledore\u0027s friendly to \u0027em ... could be they\u0027ll come.\u0027 Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry\u0027s lap. \u0027Hagrid?\u0027 said Hermione quietly after a while. \u0027Mmm?\u0027 \u0027Did you ... was there any sign of ... did you hear anything about your ... your ... mother while you were there?\u0027 Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared. \u0027I\u0027m sorry ... I ... forget it--\u0027 \u0027Dead,\u0027 Hagrid grunted. \u0027Died years ago. They told me.\u0027 \u0027Oh ... I\u0027m ... I\u0027m really sorry,\u0027 said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \u0027No need,\u0027 he said shortly. \u0027Can\u0027t remember her much. Wasn\u0027 a great mother.\u0027 They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. \u0027But you still haven\u0027t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\u0027 Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid\u0027s bloodstained face. \u0027Or why you\u0027re back so late,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago--\u0027 \u0027Who attacked you?\u0027 said Ron. \u0027I haven\u0027 bin attacked!\u0027 said Hagrid emphatically. \u0027I--\u0027 But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. \u0027It\u0027s her!\u0027 Ron whispered. \u0027Get under here!\u0027 Harry said quickly, seizing the Invisibility Cloak, he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well. Huddled together, they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused. \u0027Hagrid, hide our mugs!\u0027 Hagrid seized Harry and Ron\u0027s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang\u0027s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid\u0027s face; she barely reached his navel. \u0027So,\u0027 she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \u0027You\u0027re Hagrid, are you?\u0027 Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \u0027Get away,\u0027 she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \u0027Er--I don\u0027 want ter be rude,\u0027 said Hagrid, staring at her, \u0027but who the ruddy hell are you?\u0027 \u0027My name is Dolores Umbridge.\u0027 Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. \u0027Dolores Umbridge?\u0027 Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \u0027I thought you were one o\u0027 them Ministry--don\u0027 you work with Fudge?\u0027 \u0027I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\u0027 said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak. \u0027I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher--\u0027 \u0027Tha\u0027s brave of yeh,\u0027 said Hagrid, \u0027there\u0027s not many\u0027d take tha\u0027 job any more.\u0027 \u0027--and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\u0027 said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him. \u0027Wha\u0027s that?\u0027 said Hagrid, frowning. \u0027Precisely what I was going to ask,\u0027 said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione\u0027s mug. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, \u0027oh, tha\u0027 was ... was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\u0027 Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins. \u0027I heard voices,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027I was talkin\u0027 ter Fang,\u0027 said Hagrid stoutly. \u0027And was he talking back to you?\u0027 \u0027Well ... in a manner o\u0027 speakin\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \u0027I sometimes say Fang\u0027s near enough human--\u0027 \u0027There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\u0027 said Umbridge sleekly. Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge\u0027s robes and she did not appear to have heard. \u0027Well, I on\u0027y jus\u0027 got back,\u0027 said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \u0027Maybe someone came ter call earlier an\u0027 I missed \u0027em.\u0027 \u0027There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\u0027 \u0027Well, I ... I don\u0027 know why that\u0027d be ...\u0027 said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \u0027Erm ...\u0027 Umbridge wheeled round and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid\u0027s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking, she wheeled round again and said, \u0027What has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\u0027 Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry\u0027s opinion was a mistake, because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \u0027Oh, I ... had a bit of an accident,\u0027 he said lamely. \u0027What sort of accident?\u0027 \u0027I--I tripped.\u0027 \u0027You tripped,\u0027 she repeated coolly. \u0027Yeah, tha\u0027s right. Over ... over a friends broomstick. I don\u0027 fly, meself. Well, look at the size o\u0027 me, I don\u0027 reckon there\u0027s a broomstick that\u0027d hold me. Friend o\u0027 mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you ve ever seen em, big beasts, winged, yer know, I\u0027ve had a bit of a ride on one o\u0027 them an\u0027 it was--\u0027 \u0027Where have you been?\u0027 asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid\u0027s babbling. \u0027Where\u0027ve I--?\u0027 \u0027Been, yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027Term started two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\u0027 There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously. \u0027I--I\u0027ve been away for me health,\u0027 he said. \u0027For your health,\u0027 repeated Professor Umbridge. Her eyes travelled over Hagrid\u0027s discoloured and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently and silently on to his waistcoat. \u0027I see.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid, \u0027bit o\u0027--o\u0027 fresh air, yeh know--\u0027 \u0027Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by\u0027 said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid\u0027s face that was not black or purple, flushed. \u0027Well--change o\u0027 scene, yeh know--\u0027 \u0027Mountain scenery?\u0027 said Umbridge swiftly. She knows, Harry thought desperately. \u0027Mountains?\u0027 Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \u0027Nope, South o\u0027 France fer me. Bit o\u0027 sun an\u0027 ... an\u0027 sea.\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 said Umbridge. \u0027You don\u0027t have much of a tan.\u0027 \u0027Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin,\u0027 said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \u0027I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\u0027 \u0027Righ\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid, nodding. \u0027You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\u0027 She turned sharply and marched back to the door. \u0027You\u0027re inspectin\u0027 us?\u0027 Hagrid repeated blankly, looking after her. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \u0027The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Goodnight.\u0027 She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist. \u0027Not yet,\u0027 she breathed in his ear. \u0027She might not be gone yet.\u0027 Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so. \u0027She\u0027s goin\u0027 back ter the castle,\u0027 he said in a low voice. \u0027Blimey ... inspectin\u0027 people, is she?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, pulling off the Cloak. \u0027Trelawney\u0027s on probation already ...\u0027 \u0027Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\u0027 asked Hermione. \u0027Oh, don\u0027 you worry abou\u0027 that, I\u0027ve got a great load o\u0027 lessons planned,\u0027 said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \u0027I\u0027ve bin keepin\u0027 a couple o\u0027 creatures saved fer yer OWL year; you wait, they\u0027re somethin\u0027 really special.\u0027 \u0027Erm ... special in what way?\u0027 asked Hermione tentatively. \u0027I\u0027m not sayin\u0027,\u0027 said Hagrid happily. \u0027I don\u0027 want ter spoil the surprise.\u0027 \u0027Look, Hagrid,\u0027 said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretence, \u0027Professor Umbridge won\u0027t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that\u0027s too dangerous.\u0027 \u0027Dangerous?\u0027 said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \u0027Don\u0027 be silly, I wouldn\u0027 give yeh anythin\u0027 dangerous! I mean, all righ\u0027, they can look after themselves--\u0027 \u0027Hagrid, you\u0027ve got to pass Umbridge\u0027s inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after Porlocks, how to tell the difference between Knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\u0027 said Hermione earnestly. \u0027But tha\u0027s not very interestin\u0027, Hermione,\u0027 said Hagrid. \u0027The stuff I\u0027ve got\u0027s much more impressive. I\u0027ve bin bringin\u0027 \u0027em on fer years, I reckon I\u0027ve got the on\u0027y domestic herd in Britain.\u0027 \u0027Hagrid ... please ...\u0027 said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \u0027Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that\u0027s bound to come up in our OWL.\u0027 But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in the corner. \u0027Lis\u0027en, it\u0027s bin a long day an\u0027 it\u0027s late,\u0027 he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \u0027Oh--sorry--\u0027 He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \u0027Look, don\u0027 you go worryin\u0027 abou\u0027 me, I promise yeh I\u0027ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I\u0027m back ... now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an\u0027 don\u0027 forget ter wipe yer tootprints out behind yeh!\u0027 \u0027I dunno if you got through to him,\u0027 said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went. \u0027Then I\u0027ll go back again tomorrow,\u0027 said Hermione determinedly. \u0027I\u0027ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don\u0027t care if she throws out Trelawney but she\u0027s not getting rid of Hagrid!\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-20.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
