{"id":111685,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u0027Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There\u0027s no other explanation.\u0027 \u0027You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?\u0027 he said, outraged. \u0027I\u0027m almost certain of it,\u0027 said Hermione grimly. \u0027Watch your frog, it\u0027s escaping.\u0027 Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the table--\u0027Accio!\u0027-- and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand. Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione\u0027s whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed. \u0027I\u0027ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,\u0027 Hermione whispered. \u0027I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren\u0027t ordering them, so you wouldn\u0027t have been in trouble at all--it\u0027s a bit of a feeble joke, isn\u0027t it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it --tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it--I don\u0027t think Filch would object, when\u0027s he ever stuck up for a student\u0027s rights? Harry, you\u0027re squashing your frog.\u0027 Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk. \u0027It was a very, very close call last night,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio.\u0027 The bullfrog on which she was practising her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully. \u0027If she\u0027d caught Snuffles--\u0027 Harry finished the sentence for her. \u0027--He\u0027d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.\u0027 He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle. \u0027Silencio!\u0027 said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry\u0027s frog, which deflated silently before them. \u0027Well, he mustn\u0027t do it again, that\u0027s all. I just don\u0027t know how we\u0027re going to let him know. We can\u0027t send him an owl.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t reckon he\u0027ll risk it again,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027He\u0027s not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio.\u0027 The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw. \u0027Silencio. SILENCIO!\u0027 The raven cawed more loudly. \u0027It\u0027s the way you\u0027re moving your wand,\u0027 said Hermione, watching Ron critically, \u0027you don\u0027t want to wave it, it\u0027s more a sharp jab.\u0027 \u0027Ravens are harder than frogs,\u0027 said Ron through clenched teeth. \u0027Fi ne, let\u0027s swap,\u0027 said Hermione, seizing Ron\u0027s raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. \u0027Silencio!\u0027 The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out. \u0027Very good, Miss Granger!\u0027 said Professor Flitwick\u0027s squeaky little voice, making Harry, Ron and Hermione all jump. \u0027Now, let me see you try, Mr. Weasley\u0027 \u0027Wha--? Oh--oh, right,\u0027 said Ron, very flustered. \u0027Er--silencio!\u0027 He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye: the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk. It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework. They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody\u0027s head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students. \u0027I\u0027ve got permission!\u0027 she said. \u0027To re-form the Quidditch team!\u0027 \u0027Excellent!\u0027 said Ron and Harry together. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Angelina, beaming. \u0027I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore. Anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o\u0027clock tonight, all right, because we\u0027ve got to make up time. You realise we\u0027re only three weeks away from our first match?\u0027 She squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first-year instead, and vanished from sight. Ron\u0027s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain. \u0027Hope this clears up. What\u0027s up with you, Hermione?\u0027 She, too, was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face. \u0027Just thinking ...\u0027 she said, still frowning at the rain-washed window. \u0027About Siri-- Snuffles?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027No ... not exactly ...\u0027 said Hermione slowly. \u0027More ... wondering ... I suppose we\u0027re doing the right thing ... I think ... aren\u0027t we?\u0027 Harry and Ron looked at each other. \u0027Well, that clears that up,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027It would\u0027ve been really annoying if you hadn\u0027t explained yourself properly.\u0027 Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there. \u0027I was just wondering,\u0027 she said, her voice stronger now, \u0027whether we\u0027re doing the right thing, starting this Defence Against the Dark Arts group.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry and Ron together. \u0027Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!\u0027 said Ron indignantly. \u0027I know,\u0027 said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. \u0027But after talking to Snuffles ...\u0027 \u0027But he\u0027s all for it,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hermione, staring at the window again. \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what made me think maybe it wasn\u0027t a good idea after all ...\u0027 Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed. \u0027Let\u0027s get this straight,\u0027 said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, \u0027Sirius agrees with us, so you don\u0027t think we should do it any more?\u0027 Hermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her own hands, she said, \u0027Do you honestly trust his judgement?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I do!\u0027 said Harry at once. \u0027He\u0027s always given us great advice!\u0027 An ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully. \u0027You don\u0027t think he has become ... sort of ... reckless ... since he\u0027s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don\u0027t think he\u0027s ... kind of ... living through us?\u0027 \u0027What d\u0027you mean, \"living through us\"?\u0027 Harry retorted. \u0027I mean ... well, I think he\u0027d love to be forming secret Defence societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry ... I think he\u0027s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is ... so I think he\u0027s keen to kind of ... egg us on.\u0027 Ron looked utterly perplexed. \u0027Sirius is right,\u0027 he said, \u0027you do sound just like my mother.\u0027 Hermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down on Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head. The weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o\u0027clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary. They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying. \u0027... but I bet she\u0027d know what we\u0027d done,\u0027 Fred said out of the corner of his mouth. \u0027If only I hadn\u0027t offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday.\u0027 \u0027We could try the Fever Fudge,\u0027 George muttered, \u0027no one\u0027s seen that yet--\u0027 \u0027Does it work?\u0027 enquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building. \u0027Well, yeah,\u0027 said Fred, \u0027your temperature\u0027ll go right up.\u0027 \u0027But you get these massive pus-filled boils, too,\u0027 said George, \u0027and we haven\u0027t worked out how to get rid of them yet.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t see any boils,\u0027 said Ron, staring at the twins. \u0027No, well, you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Fred darkly, \u0027they\u0027re not in a place we generally display to the public.\u0027 \u0027But they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the--\u0027 \u0027All right, everyone, listen up,\u0027 said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain\u0027s office. \u0027I know it\u0027s not ideal weather, but there\u0027s a chance we\u0027ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it\u0027s a good idea to work out how we\u0027re going to cope with them. Harry, didn\u0027t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?\u0027 \u0027Hermione did it,\u0027 said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped his glasses and said, \u0027Impervius!\u0027 \u0027I think we all ought to try that,\u0027 said Angelina. \u0027If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility--all together, come on--Impervius!OK. Let\u0027s go.\u0027 They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms. They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds. \u0027All right, on my whistle,\u0027 shouted Angelina. Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upwards, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practising; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately, Angelina did not see this. In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake. Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat. She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry. \u0027I think a few of mine have ruptured,\u0027 said Fred in a hollow voice. \u0027Mine haven\u0027t,\u0027 said George, through clenched teeth, \u0027they\u0027re throbbing like mad ... feel bigger if anything.\u0027 \u0027OUCH!\u0027 said Harry. He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than it had in weeks. \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 said several voices. Harry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses, but he could still tell that everyone\u0027s face was turned towards him. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he muttered, \u0027I--poked myself in the eye, that\u0027s all.\u0027 But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low over their ears. \u0027What happened?\u0027 said Ron, the moment Alicia had disappeared through the door. \u0027Was it your scar?\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027But ...\u0027 looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, \u0027he--he can\u0027t be near us now, can he?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Harry muttered, sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead. \u0027He\u0027s probably miles away. It hurt because ... he\u0027s ... angry.\u0027 Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them--yet knew at once that they were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper. \u0027Did you see him?\u0027 said Ron, looking horrified. \u0027Did you ... get a vision, or something?\u0027 Harry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain. A confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices ... \u0027He wants something done, and it\u0027s not happening fast enough,\u0027 he said. Again, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth, and yet was quite certain they were true. \u0027But ... how do you know?\u0027 said Ron. Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him. \u0027Is this what it was about last time?\u0027 said Ron in a hushed voice. \u0027When your scar hurt in Umbridge\u0027s office? You-Know-Who was angry?\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027What is it, then?\u0027 Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge\u0027s face ... his scar had hurt ... and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach ... a strange, leaping feeling ... a happy feeling ... but of course, he had not recognised it for what it was, as he had been feeling so miserable himself ... \u0027Last time, it was because he was pleased,\u0027 he said. \u0027Really pleased. He thought ... something good was going to happen. And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ...\u0027 he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron\u0027s bedroom in Grimmauld Place ... he was furious. He looked round at Ron, who was gaping at him. \u0027You could take over from Trelawney, mate,\u0027 he said in an awed voice. \u0027I\u0027m not making prophecies,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027No, you know what you\u0027re doing?\u0027 Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed. \u0027Harry, you\u0027re reading You-Know-Who\u0027s mind!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head. \u0027It\u0027s more like ... his mood, I suppose. I\u0027m just getting flashes of what mood he\u0027s in. Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I\u0027m feeling it when he\u0027s pleased, too ...\u0027 There was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building. \u0027You\u0027ve got to tell someone,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027I told Sirius last time.\u0027 \u0027Well, tell him about this time!\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t, can I?\u0027 said Harry grimly. \u0027Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember?\u0027 \u0027Well then, Dumbledore.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve just told you, he already knows,\u0027 said Harry shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him. \u0027There\u0027s no point telling him again.\u0027 Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully. \u0027Dumbledore\u0027d want to know,\u0027 he said. Harry shrugged. \u0027C\u0027mon ... we\u0027ve still got Silencing Charms to practise.\u0027 They hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough? \u0027... he\u0027s got other plans ... plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed ... stuff he can only get by stealth ... like a weapon. Something he didn\u0027t have last time.\u0027 Harry had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry interference ... but now they came back to him and made him wonder ... Voldemort\u0027s anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon, whatever it was. Had the Order thwarted him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now? \u0027Mimbulus mimbletonia,\u0027 said Ron\u0027s voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room. It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not around, because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore, too. Ron kept throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Charms books and set to work on finishing his essay, though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time Ron said he was going up to bed, too, he had written hardly anything. Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it. These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness ... ... Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place ... ... moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used ... ... the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling ... ... therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts ... ... confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Voldemort was feeling? What was this weird connection between them, which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily? ... where the wizard is desirous ... ... how Harry would like to sleep ... ... of producing hot-headedness ... ... it was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes, Crookshanks purring, and the crackling of the flames ... The book slipped from Harry\u0027s slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug. His head lolled sideways ... He was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his footsteps echoing in the silence. As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger, his heart beat fast with excitement ... if he could only open it ... enter beyond ... He stretched out his hand ... his fingertips were inches from it ... \u0027Harry Potter, sir!\u0027 He awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the common room, but there was something moving close by. \u0027Whozair?\u0027 said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was almost out, the room very dark. \u0027Dobby has your owl, sir!\u0027 said a squeaky voice. \u0027Dobby?\u0027 said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice. Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats. His large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured. \u0027Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter\u0027s owl,\u0027 said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face, \u0027Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir.\u0027 He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of Harry\u0027s chair. \u0027Thanks, Dobby!\u0027 said Harry, stroking Hedwig\u0027s head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream ... it had been very vivid. Surveying Dobby more closely, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body. \u0027Er ... have you been taking all the clothes Hermione\u0027s been leaving out?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no, sir,\u0027 said Dobby happily. \u0027Dobby has been taking some for Winky, too, sir.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, how is Winky?\u0027 asked Harry. Bobby\u0027s ears drooped slightly. \u0027Winky is still drinking lots, sir,\u0027 he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. \u0027She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower any more, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!\u0027 Dobby sank into a deep bow again. \u0027But Harry Potter does not seem happy,\u0027 Dobby went on, straightening up again and kicking timidly at Harry. \u0027Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?\u0027 \u0027Not really bad,\u0027 said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve had worse.\u0027 The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orb-like eyes. Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, \u0027Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now.\u0027 Harry smiled. \u0027You can\u0027t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer.\u0027 He bent and picked up his Potions book. He\u0027d have to try to finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand--the result of his detentions with Umbridge ... \u0027Wait a moment-- there is something you can do for me, Dobby,\u0027 said Harry slowly. The elf looked round, beaming. \u0027Name it, Harry Potter, sir!\u0027 \u0027I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practise Defence Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,\u0027 Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, \u0027Professor Umbridge.\u0027 He expected the elf\u0027s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say it was impossible, or else that he would try to find somewhere, but his hopes were not high. What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling cheerfully, and clap his hands together. \u0027Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!\u0027 he said happily. \u0027Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 said Harry curiously. \u0027Because it is a room that a person can only enter,\u0027 said Dobby seriously, \u0027when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker\u0027s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,\u0027 said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, \u0027when Winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir ... and Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and--\u0027 \u0027And if you really needed a bathroom,\u0027 said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, \u0027would it fill itself with chamber pots?\u0027 \u0027Dobby expects so, sir,\u0027 said Dobby, nodding earnestly. \u0027It is a most amazing room, sir.\u0027 \u0027How many people know about it?\u0027 said Harry, sitting up straight er in his chair. \u0027Very few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.\u0027 \u0027It sounds brilliant,\u0027 said Harry, his heart racing. \u0027It sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?\u0027 \u0027Any time, Harry Potter, sir,\u0027 said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry\u0027s enthusiasm. \u0027We could go now, if you like!\u0027 For a moment Harry was tempted to go with Dobby. He was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione\u0027s whispered in his ear: reckless.It was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had Snape\u0027s essay to finish. \u0027Not tonight, Dobby,\u0027 said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. \u0027This is really important ... I don\u0027t want to blow it, it\u0027ll need proper planning. Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is, and how to get in there?\u0027 Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon\u0027s Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was cancelled. \u0027Good,\u0027 said Harry quietly, when she. told him, \u0027because we\u0027ve found somewhere to have our first Defence meeting. Tonight, eight o\u0027clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?\u0027 She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him. \u0027What?\u0027 he said thickly. \u0027Well ... it\u0027s just that Dobby\u0027s plans aren\u0027t always that safe. Don\u0027t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?\u0027 \u0027This room isn\u0027t just some mad idea of Dobby\u0027s; Dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.\u0027 Hermione\u0027s expression cleared. \u0027Dumbledore told you about it?\u0027 \u0027Just in passing,\u0027 said Harry, shrugging. \u0027Oh, well, that\u0027s all right then,\u0027 said Hermione briskly and raised no more objections. Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog\u0027s Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry\u0027s disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog\u0027s Head. At half past seven Harry, Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o\u0027clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor. \u0027Hold it,\u0027 Harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand and muttering, \u0027I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\u0027 A map of Hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots, labelled with names, showed where various people were. \u0027Filch is on the second floor,\u0027 said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes, \u0027and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.\u0027 \u0027And Umbridge?\u0027 said Hermione anxiously. \u0027In her office,\u0027 said Harry, pointing. \u0027OK, let\u0027s go.\u0027 They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy\u0027s foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet. \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch them. \u0027Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.\u0027 They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; Hermione was whispering something under her breath; Harry\u0027s fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him. We need somewhere to learn to fight ... he thought. Just give us a place to practise ... somewhere they can\u0027t find us ... \u0027Harry!\u0027 said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past. A highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below. The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody\u0027s office. \u0027These will be good when we\u0027re practising Stunning,\u0027 said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot. \u0027And just look at these books!\u0027 said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. \u0027A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions ... The Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self-Defensive Spellwork ... wow ...\u0027 She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. \u0027Harry, this is wonderful, there\u0027s everything we need here!\u0027 And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read. There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived. \u0027Whoa,\u0027 said Dean, staring around, impressed. \u0027What is this place?\u0027 Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o\u0027clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Harry, slightly nervously. \u0027This is the place we\u0027ve found for practice sessions, and you\u0027ve--er--obviously found it OK.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s fantastic!\u0027 said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement. \u0027It\u0027s bizarre,\u0027 said Fred, frowning around at it. \u0027We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then.\u0027 \u0027Hey, Harry, what\u0027s this stuff?\u0027 asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass. \u0027Dark detectors,\u0027 said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. \u0027Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don\u0027t want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled ...\u0027 He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognisable. He turned his back on it. \u0027Well, I\u0027ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and--er--\u0027 He noticed a raised hand. \u0027What, Hermione?\u0027 \u0027I think we ought to elect a leader,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Harry\u0027s leader,\u0027 said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad. Harry\u0027s stomach did yet another back-flip. \u0027Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,\u0027 said Hermione, unperturbed. \u0027It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So--everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?\u0027 Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly. \u0027Er--right, thanks,\u0027 said Harry, who could feel his face burning. \u0027And--what,Hermione?\u0027 \u0027I also think we ought to have a name,\u0027 she said brightly, her hand still in the air. \u0027It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don\u0027t you think?\u0027 \u0027Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?\u0027 said Angelina hopefully. \u0027Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group?\u0027 suggested Fred. \u0027I was thinking,\u0027 said Hermione, frowning at Fred, \u0027more of a name that didn\u0027t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.\u0027 \u0027The Defence Association?\u0027 said Cho. \u0027The DA for short, so nobody knows what we\u0027re talking about?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, the DA\u0027s good,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027Only let\u0027s make it stand for Dumbledore\u0027s Army, because that\u0027s the Ministry\u0027s worst fear, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this. \u0027All in favour of the DA?\u0027 said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. \u0027That\u0027s a majority--motion passed!\u0027 She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters: DUMBLEDORE\u0027S ARMY \u0027Right,\u0027 said Harry, when she had sat down again, \u0027shall we get practising then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it\u0027s pretty basic but I\u0027ve found it really useful--\u0027 \u0027Oh, please,\u0027 said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. \u0027I don\u0027t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve used it against him,\u0027 said Harry quietly. \u0027It saved my life in June.\u0027 Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet. \u0027But if you think it\u0027s beneath you, you can leave,\u0027 Harry said. Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, \u0027I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise.\u0027 It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless. \u0027You can practise with me,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027Right--on the count of three, then--one, two, three--\u0027 The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus.Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them. \u0027Expelliarmus!\u0027 said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand. \u0027I DID IT!\u0027 said Neville gleefully. \u0027I\u0027ve never done it before--I DID IT!\u0027 \u0027Good one!\u0027 said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville\u0027s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. \u0027Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?\u0027 Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back. \u0027Sorry Harry,\u0027 said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. \u0027Couldn\u0027t resist.\u0027 Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end. \u0027OK, stop!\u0027 Harry shouted. \u0027Stop. STOP!\u0027 I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands. \u0027That wasn\u0027t bad,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but there\u0027s definite room for improvement.\u0027 Zacharias Smith glared at him. \u0027Let\u0027s try again.\u0027 He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions. Slowly, the general performance improved. He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer. \u0027Oh no,\u0027 said Cho rather wildly as he approached. \u0027Expelliarmious!I mean, Expellimellius! I--oh, sorry, Marietta!\u0027 Her curly-haired friend\u0027s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault. \u0027You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!\u0027 Cho told Harry ruefully. \u0027That was quite good,\u0027 Harry lied, but when she raised her eyebrows he said, \u0027Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there.\u0027 She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away. \u0027Don\u0027t mind her,\u0027 Cho muttered. \u0027She doesn\u0027t really want to be here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge. You see--her mum works for the Ministry.\u0027 \u0027What about your parents?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027Well, they\u0027ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,\u0027 said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. \u0027But if they think I\u0027m not going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric--\u0027 She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot\u0027s wand went whizzing past Harry\u0027s ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose. \u0027Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!\u0027 said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch--\u0027Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head. \u0027He\u0027s always saying he\u0027d believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there\u0027s his Umgubular Slashkilter--\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t ask,\u0027 Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled. \u0027Hey, Harry,\u0027 Hermione called from the other end of the room, \u0027have you checked the time?\u0027 He looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out of bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody stopped shouting \u0027Expelliarmus\u0027 and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor. \u0027Well, that was pretty good,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but we\u0027ve overrun, we\u0027d better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?\u0027 \u0027Sooner!\u0027 said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement. Angelina, however, said quickly, \u0027The Quidditch season\u0027s about to start, we need team practices too!\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s say next Wednesday night, then,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027we can decide on additional meetings then. Come on, we\u0027d better get going.\u0027 He pulled out the Marauder\u0027s Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady\u0027s portrait. \u0027That was really, really good, Harry,\u0027 said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left. \u0027Yeah, it was!\u0027 said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. \u0027Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?\u0027 \u0027Only once,\u0027 said Hermione, stung. \u0027I got you loads more than you got me--\u0027 \u0027I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times--\u0027 \u0027Well, if you\u0027re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand--\u0027 They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder\u0027s Map, but he was also thinking of Cho saying he made her nervous.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-18.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
