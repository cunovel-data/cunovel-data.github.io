{"id":111696,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge\u0027s office, knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing.\\n\\n Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall--it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world ...\\n\\n Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass--Umbridge jogging to keep up--their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s hidden in Hagrid\u0027s hut, is it?\u0027 said Umbridge eagerly in Harry\u0027s ear.\\n\\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 said Hermione scathingly. \u0027Hagrid might have set it off accidentally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. \u0027Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf.\u0027\\n\\n She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill.\\n\\n \u0027Th en ... where is it? asked Umbridge, with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest.\\n\\n \u0027In there, of course,\u0027 said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. \u0027It had to be somewhere that students weren\u0027t going to find it accidentally, didn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now. \u0027Of course ... very well, then ... you two stay ahead of me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can we have your wand, then, if we\u0027re going first?\u0027 Harry asked her.\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so, Mr. Potter,\u0027 said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it. \u0027The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\\n\\n As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione\u0027s eye; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.\\n\\n \u0027Is it very far in?\u0027 Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Hermione, \u0027yes, it\u0027s well hidden.\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.\\n\\n \u0027Er--are you sure this is the right way?\u0027 he asked her pointedly.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, \u0027It\u0027s a bit further in!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hermione, keep your voice down,\u0027 Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her. \u0027Anything could be listening in here--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want us heard,\u0027 she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. \u0027You\u0027ll see ...\u0027\\n\\n They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes.\\n\\n \u0027How much further?\u0027 demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him.\\n\\n \u0027Not far now!\u0027 shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. \u0027Just a little bit --\u0027\\n\\n An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield--\\n\\n He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant smile.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 said a voice.\\n\\n Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle: his bow, like those of the others, was raised. On Harry\u0027s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.\\n\\n \u0027I asked you who are you, human,\u0027 said Magorian roughly.\\n\\n \u0027I am Dolores Umbridge!\u0027 said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terrified voice. \u0027Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are from the Ministry of Magic?\u0027 said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right!\u0027 said Umbridge, in an even higher voice, \u0027so be very careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did you call us?\u0027 shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognised as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t call them that!\u0027 Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, \u0027Law Fifteen \"B\" states clearly that \"any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"Near-human intelligence\"?\u0027 repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. \u0027We consider that a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you doing in our Forest?\u0027 bellowed the hard-faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest. \u0027Why are you here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your Forest?\u0027 said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. \u0027I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land--\u0027\\n\\n An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing: she let out an ear-splitting scream and threw her hands over her head, while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.\\n\\n \u0027Whose Forest is it now, human?\u0027 bellowed Bane.\\n\\n \u0027Filthy half-breeds!\u0027 she screamed, her hands still tight over her head. \u0027Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet!\u0027 shouted Hermione, but it was too late: Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, \u0027Incarcerous!\u0027\\n\\n Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur\u0027s torso and trapping his arms: he gave a cry of rage and reared on to his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged.\\n\\n Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground; face down on the Forest floor, he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage.\\n\\n \u0027Nooooo!\u0027 he heard Umbridge shriek. \u0027Noooooo ... I am Senior Undersecretary ... you cannot--Unhand me, you animals ... nooooo!\u0027\\n\\n Harry saw a flash of red light and knew she had attempted to Stun one of them; then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the ground, and Harry\u0027s heart leapt. If he could just reach it--\u0027\\n\\n But as he stretched out a hand towards it, a centaur\u0027s hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.\\n\\n \u0027Now!\u0027 roared a voice in Harry\u0027s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright. Hermione, too, had been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-coloured backs and heads of the centaurs, Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane. Screaming non-stop, her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.\\n\\n \u0027And these?\u0027 said the hard-faced, grey centaur holding Hermione.\\n\\n \u0027They are young,\u0027 said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. \u0027We do not attack foals.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They brought her here, Ronan,\u0027 replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry. \u0027And they are not so young ... he is nearing manhood, this one.\u0027\\n\\n He shook Harry by the neck of his robes.\\n\\n \u0027Please,\u0027 said Hermione breathlessly, \u0027please, don\u0027t attack us, We don\u0027t think like her, we aren\u0027t Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because we hoped you\u0027d drive her off for us.\u0027\\n\\n Harry knew at once, from the look on the face of the grey centaur holding Hermione, that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this. The grey centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, \u0027You see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we, human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. \u0027Please--I didn\u0027t mean that! I just hoped you\u0027d be able to--to help us--\u0027\\n\\n But she seemed to be going from bad to worse.\\n\\n \u0027We do not help humans!\u0027 snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry\u0027s feet left the ground momentarily. \u0027We are a race apart and proud to be so. We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we did your bidding!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not going to say anything like that!\u0027 Harry shouted. \u0027We know you didn\u0027t do what you did because we wanted you to--\u0027\\n\\n But nobody seemed to be listening to him.\\n\\n A bearded centaur towards the back of the crowd shouted, \u0027They came here unasked, they must pay the consequences!\u0027\\n\\n A roar of approval met these words and a dun-coloured centaur shouted, \u0027They can join the woman!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said you didn\u0027t hurt the innocent!\u0027 shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her face now. \u0027We haven\u0027t done anything to hurt you, we haven\u0027t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!\u0027 shouted the grey centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows. \u0027Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognise your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are--\u0027\\n\\n But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them, Harry, Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing, looked around. Harry\u0027s centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows. Hermione had been dropped, too, and Harry hurried towards her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.\\n\\n The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind; the clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upwards at the enormous greyish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp\u0027s lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly; they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-coloured eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from both ankles.\\n\\n He opened his mouth even wider.\\n\\n \u0027Hagger.\u0027\\n\\n Harry did not know what \u0027hagger\u0027 meant, or what language it was from, nor did he much care; he was watching Grawp\u0027s feet, which were almost as long as Harry\u0027s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.\\n\\n \u0027Hagger!\u0027 he said again, more insistently.\\n\\n \u0027Get away from here, giant!\u0027 called Magorian. \u0027You are not welcome among us!\u0027\\n\\n These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. He stooped a little (the centaurs\u0027 arms tensed on their bows), then bellowed, \u0027HAGGER!\u0027\\n\\n A few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however, gave a gasp.\\n\\n \u0027Harry!\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I think he\u0027s trying to say \"Hagrid\"!\u0027\\n\\n At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so, staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, \u0027Hermy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goodness,\u0027 said Hermione, gripping Harry\u0027s arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, \u0027he--he remembered!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027HERMY!\u0027 roared Grawp. \u0027WHERE HAGGER?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know!\u0027 squealed Hermione, terrified. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Grawp, I don\u0027t know!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027GRAWP WANT HAGGER!\u0027\\n\\n One of the giants massive hands reached down. Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backwards and fell over. Devoid of a wand, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite or whatever else it took as the hand swooped towards him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs.\\n\\n It was what the centaurs had been waiting for--Grawp\u0027s outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows soared through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up, rubbing his face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the arrowheads in still deeper.\\n\\n He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaur; scattered out of the way; pebble-sized droplets of Grawp\u0027s blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked back; Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. Harry and Hermione watched Grawp give another roar of fury and plunge after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.\\n\\n \u0027Oh no,\u0027 said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. \u0027Oh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not that fussed, to be honest,\u0027 said Harry bitterly.\\n\\n The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant grew fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them, his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.\\n\\n They had wasted so much time--they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.\\n\\n \u0027Smart plan,\u0027 he spat at Hermione, having to release some of his fury. \u0027Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We need to get back up to the castle,\u0027 said Hermione faintly.\\n\\n \u0027By the time we\u0027ve done that, Sirius\u0027ll probably be dead!\u0027 said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper. A high-pitched chattering started up overhead and he looked up to see an angry Bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we can\u0027t do anything without wands,\u0027 said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again. \u0027Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, we were just wondering that.\u0027 said a familiar voice from behind her.\\n\\n Harry and Hermione moved together instinctively and peered through the trees.\\n\\n Ron came into sight, closely followed by Ginny, Neville and Luna. All of them looked a little the worse for wear--there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny\u0027s cheek; a large purple lump was swelling above Neville\u0027s right eye; Ron\u0027s lip was bleeding worse than ever--but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry\u0027s wand, \u0027had any ideas?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you get away?\u0027 asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.\\n\\n \u0027Couple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,\u0027 said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione\u0027s wand, too. \u0027But Ginny was best, she got Malfoy--Bat Bogey Hex--it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things. Anyway, we saw you out of the window heading into the Forest and followed. What\u0027ve you done with Umbridge?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She got carried away,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027By a herd of centaurs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they left you behind?\u0027 asked Ginny, looking astonished.\\n\\n \u0027No, they got chased off by Grawp,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s Grawp?\u0027 Luna asked interestedly.\\n\\n \u0027Hagrid\u0027s little brother,\u0027 said Ron promptly. \u0027Anyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or--?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, \u0027and I\u0027m sure Sirius is still alive, but I can\u0027t see how we\u0027re going to get there to help him.\u0027\\n\\n They all fell silent, looking rather scared; the problem facing them seemed insurmountable.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we\u0027ll have to fly, won\u0027t we?\u0027 said Luna, in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry irritably, rounding on her. \u0027First of all, \"we\" aren\u0027t doing anything if you\u0027re including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron\u0027s me only one with a broomstick that isn\u0027t being guarded by a security troll, so--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a broom!\u0027 said Ginny.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but you\u0027re not coming,\u0027 said Ron angrily.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!\u0027 said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re too--\u0027 Harry began, but Ginny said fiercely, \u0027I\u0027m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Philosophers Stone, and it\u0027s because of me that Malfoy\u0027s stuck back in Umbridge\u0027s office with giant flying bogies attacking him--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We were all in the DA together,\u0027 said Neville quietly. \u0027It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn\u0027t it? And this is the first chance we\u0027ve had to do something real--or was that all just a game or something?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No--of course it wasn\u0027t--\u0027 said Harry impatiently.\\n\\n \u0027Then we should come too,\u0027 said Neville simply. \u0027We want to help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Luna, smiling happily.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s eyes met Ron\u0027s. He knew Ron was thinking exactly what he was: if he could have chosen any members of the DA, in addition to himself, Ron and Hermione, to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville or Luna.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it doesn\u0027t matter, anyway,\u0027 said Harry through gritted teeth, \u0027because we still don\u0027t know how to get there--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought we\u0027d settled that,\u0027 said Luna maddeningly. \u0027We\u0027re flying!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 said Ron, barely containing his anger, \u0027you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can\u0027t sprout wings whenever we--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There are ways of flying other than with broomsticks,\u0027 said Luna serenely.\\n\\n \u0027I s\u0027pose we\u0027re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?\u0027 Ron demanded.\\n\\n \u0027The Crumple-Horned Snorkack can\u0027t fly,\u0027 said Luna in a dignified voice, \u0027but they can, and Hagrid says they\u0027re very good at finding places their riders are looking for.\u0027\\n\\n Harry whirled round. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 he whispered, moving towards them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one\u0027s shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?\\n\\n \u0027Is it those mad horse things?\u0027 said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. \u0027Those ones you can\u0027t see unless you\u0027ve watched someone snuff it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027How many?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just two.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, we need three,\u0027 said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\\n\\n \u0027Four, Hermione,\u0027 said Ginny, scowling.\\n\\n \u0027I think there are six of us, actually,\u0027 said Luna calmly, counting.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid, we can\u0027t all go!\u0027 said Harry angrily. \u0027Look, you three--\u0027 he pointed at Neville, Ginny and Luna, \u0027you\u0027re not involved in this, you\u0027re not--\u0027\\n\\n They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.\\n\\n \u0027OK, fine, it\u0027s your choice,\u0027 he said curtly, \u0027but unless we can find more Thestrals you\u0027re not going to be able--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, more of them will come,\u0027 said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.\\n\\n \u0027What makes you think that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,\u0027 she said coolly, \u0027and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That\u0027s probably why these two turned up in the first place.\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp\u0027s blood.\\n\\n \u0027OK, then,\u0027 he said, a bright idea occurring, \u0027Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she\u0027ll attract more Thestrals--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not staying behind!\u0027 said Hermione furiously.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no need,\u0027 said Luna, smiling. \u0027Look, here come more now ... you two must really smell ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said angrily, \u0027pick one and get on, then.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-33.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
