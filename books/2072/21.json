{"id":111687,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Hermione ploughed her way back to Hagrid\u0027s cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, Tying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.\n \u0027Oi!\u0027 bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, \u0027I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window--OUCH!\u0027\n He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.\n \u0027It\u0027s Fred and George,\u0027 he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him. \u0027Gits ...\u0027\n Hermione returned from Hagrid\u0027s just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees.\n \u0027So?\u0027 said Ron, looking up when she entered. \u0027Got all his lessons planned for him?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I tried,\u0027 she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. \u0027He wasn\u0027t even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the Forest--\u0027\n Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. \u0027What\u0027s he keeping in there? Did he say?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hermione miserably. \u0027He says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn\u0027t get it. He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study Knarls than Chimaeras--oh, I don\u0027t think he\u0027s got a Chimaera,\u0027 she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron\u0027s faces, \u0027but that\u0027s not for lack of trying, from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. I don\u0027t know how many times I told him he\u0027d be better off following Grubbly-Plank\u0027s plan, I honestly don\u0027t think he listened to half of what I said. He\u0027s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won\u0027t say how he got all those injuries.\u0027\n Hagrid\u0027s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid\u0027s enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-Planks lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank\u0027s idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.\n It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrid\u0027s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them.\n However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow towards Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the Forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.\n \u0027We\u0027re workin\u0027 in here today!\u0027 Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him. \u0027Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark.\u0027\n \u0027What prefers the dark?\u0027 Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. \u0027What did he say prefers the dark--did you hear?\u0027\n Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now; he had not been very brave then, either. He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.\n \u0027Ready?\u0027 said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. \u0027Right, well, I\u0027ve bin savin\u0027 a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we\u0027d go an\u0027 see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we\u0027re studyin\u0027 today is pretty rare, I reckon I\u0027m probably the on\u0027y person in Britain who\u0027s managed ter train \u0027em.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re sure they\u0027re trained, are you?\u0027 said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced. \u0027Only it wouldn\u0027t be the first time you\u0027d brought wild stuff to class, would it?\u0027\n The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too.\n \u0027Course they\u0027re trained,\u0027 said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.\n \u0027So what happened to your face, then?\u0027 demanded Malfoy.\n \u0027Mind yer own business!\u0027 said Hagrid, angrily. \u0027Now, if yeh\u0027ve finished askin\u0027 stupid questions, follow me!\u0027\n He turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.\n They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.\n \u0027Gather roun\u0027, gather roun\u0027,\u0027 Hagrid encouraged. \u0027Now, they\u0027ll be attracted by the smell \u0027o the meat but I\u0027m going ter give em a call anyway, \u0027cause they\u0027ll like ter know it\u0027s me.\u0027\n He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound.\n Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.\n A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.\n A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, \u0027Why doesn\u0027t Hagrid call again?\u0027\n Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron\u0027s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.\n \u0027Oh, an\u0027 here comes another one!\u0027 said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. \u0027Now ... put yer hands up, who can see \u0027em?\u0027\n Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.\n \u0027Yeah ... yeah, I knew you\u0027d be able ter, Harry,\u0027 he said seriously. \u0027An\u0027 you too, Neville, eh? An\u0027--\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Malfoy in a sneering voice, \u0027but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?\u0027\n For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed.\n \u0027What\u0027s doing it?\u0027 Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. \u0027What\u0027s eating it?\u0027\n \u0027Thestrals,\u0027 said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft \u0027Oh!\u0027 of comprehension at Harry\u0027s shoulder. \u0027Hogwarts has got a whole herd of \u0027em in here. Now, who knows --?\u0027\n \u0027But they\u0027re really, really unlucky!\u0027 interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed. \u0027They\u0027re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once--\u0027\n \u0027No, no, no,\u0027 said Hagrid, chuckling, \u0027tha\u0027s jus\u0027 superstition, that is, they aren\u0027 unlucky, they\u0027re dead clever an\u0027 useful! Course, this lot don\u0027 get a lot o\u0027 work, it\u0027s mainly jus\u0027 pullin\u0027 the school carriages unless Dumbledore\u0027s takin\u0027 a long journey an\u0027 don\u0027 want ter Apparate--an\u0027 here\u0027s another couple, look--\u0027\n Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, \u0027I think I felt something, I think it\u0027s near me!\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027 worry, it won\u0027 hurt yeh,\u0027 said Hagrid patiently. \u0027Righ\u0027, now, who can tell me why some o\u0027 yeh can see \u0027em an\u0027 some can\u0027t?\u0027\n Hermione raised her hand.\n \u0027Go on then,\u0027 said Hagrid, beaming at her.\n \u0027The only people who can see Thestrals,\u0027 she said, \u0027are people who have seen death.\u0027\n \u0027Tha\u0027s exactly right,\u0027 said Hagrid solemnly, \u0027ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, Thestrals--\u0027\n \u0027Hem, hem.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at the ready. Hagrid. who had never heard Umbridge\u0027s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.\n \u0027Hem, hem.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, hello!\u0027 Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise.\n \u0027You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?\u0027 said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. \u0027Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid brightly. \u0027Glad yeh found the place all righ\u0027! Well, as you can see-- or, I dunno--can you? We\u0027re doin\u0027 Thestrals today--\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027 said Professor Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her ear and frowning. \u0027What did you say?\u0027\n Hagrid looked a little confused.\n \u0027Er--Thestrals!\u0027 he said loudly. \u0027Big--er--winged horses, yeh know!\u0027\n He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard: \u0027Has ... to ... resort ... to ... crude ... sign ... language.\u0027\n \u0027Well ... anyway ...\u0027 said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered, \u0027erm ... what was I sayin?\u0027\n \u0027Appears ... to ... have ... poor ... short ... term ... memory,\u0027 muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.\n \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge\u0027s clipboard, but ploughing on valiantly. \u0027Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an\u0027 five females. This one,\u0027 he patted the first horse to have appeared, \u0027name o\u0027 Tenebrus, he\u0027s my special favourite, firs\u0027 one born here in the Forest--\u0027\n \u0027Are you aware,\u0027 Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, \u0027that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as \"dangerous\"?\u0027\n Harry\u0027s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.\n \u0027Thestrals aren\u0027 dangerous! All righ\u0027, they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them --\u0027\n \u0027Shows ... signs ... of... pleasure ... at ... idea ... of... violence,\u0027 muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again.\n \u0027No--come on!\u0027 said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. \u0027I mean, a dog\u0027ll bite if yeh bait it, won\u0027 it--but Thestrals have jus\u0027 got a bad reputation because o\u0027 the death thing--people used ter think they were bad omens, didn\u0027 they? Jus\u0027 didn\u0027 understand, did they?\u0027\n Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, \u0027Please continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk,\u0027 she mimed walking (Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter) \u0027among the students\u0027 (she pointed around at individual members of the class) \u0027and ask them questions.\u0027 She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking.\n Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.\n \u0027You hag, you evil hag!\u0027 she whispered, as Umbridge walked towards Pansy Parkinson. \u0027I know what you\u0027re doing, you awiul, twisted, vicious--\u0027\n \u0027Erm ... anyway,\u0027 said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, \u0027so --Thestrals. Yeah. Well, there\u0027s loads o\u0027 good stuff abou\u0027 them ...\u0027\n \u0027Do you find,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, \u0027that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?\u0027\n Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles.\n \u0027No ... because ... well ... it sounds ... like grunting a lot of the time ...\u0027\n Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrid\u0027s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy\u0027s answer.\n \u0027Er ... yeah ... good stuff abou\u0027 Thestrals. Well, once they\u0027re tamed, like this lot, yeh\u0027ll never be lost again. \u0027Mazin\u0027 sense o\u0027 direction, jus\u0027 tell \u0027em where yeh want ter go--\u0027\n \u0027Assuming they can understand you, of course,\u0027 said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.\n \u0027You can see the Thestrals, Longbottom, can you?\u0027 she said.\n Neville nodded.\n \u0027Who did you see die?\u0027 she asked, her tone indifferent.\n \u0027My ... my grandad,\u0027 said Neville.\n \u0027And what do you think of them?\u0027 she said, waving her stubby hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.\n \u0027Erm,\u0027 said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. \u0027Well, they\u0027re ... er ... OK ...\u0027\n \u0027Students ... are ... too ... intimidated ... to ... admit ... they ... are ... frightened,\u0027 muttered Umbridge, making another note on her clipboard.\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Neville, looking upset. \u0027No, I\u0027m not scared of them!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s quite all right,\u0027 said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to Harry. \u0027Well, Hagrid,\u0027 she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, \u0027I think I\u0027ve got enough to be getting along with. You will receive\u0027 (she mimed taking something from the air in front of her) \u0027the results of your inspection\u0027 (she pointed at the clipboard) \u0027in ten days\u0027 time.\u0027 She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset.\n \u0027That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!\u0027 stormed Hermione half an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow. \u0027You see what she\u0027s up to? It\u0027s her thing about half-breeds all over again--she\u0027s trying to make out Hagrid\u0027s some kind of dimwitted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother--and oh, it\u0027s not fair, that really wasn\u0027t a bad lesson at all--I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but Thestrals are fine--in fact, for Hagrid, they\u0027re really good!\u0027\n \u0027Umbridge said they\u0027re dangerous,\u0027 said Ron.\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,\u0027 said Hermione impatiently, \u0027and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn\u0027t usually show them to us before NEWT level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren\u0027t they? The way some people can see them and some can\u0027t! I wish I could.\u0027\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 Harry asked her quietly.\n She looked suddenly horrorstruck.\n \u0027Oh, Harry--I\u0027m sorry--no, of course I don\u0027t--that was a really stupid thing to say.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s OK,\u0027 he said quickly, \u0027don\u0027t worry\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m surprised so many people could see them,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Three in a class--\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,\u0027 said a malicious voice. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them. \u0027D\u0027you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you\u0027d be able to see the Quaffle better?\u0027\n He, Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle, then broke into a chorus of \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027. Ron\u0027s ears turned scarlet.\n \u0027Ignore them, just ignore them,\u0027 intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.\n December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth-years. Ron and Hermione\u0027s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (\u0027You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,\u0027 said Ron), to watch over first- and second-years spending their break-times inside because of the bitter cold (\u0027And they\u0027re cheeky little snot-rags, you know, we definitely weren\u0027t that rude when we were in first year,\u0027 said Ron) and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (\u0027He\u0027s got dung for brains, that one,\u0027 said Ron furiously). They were so busy that Hermione had even stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three.\n \u0027All those poor elves I haven\u0027t set free yet, having to stay here over Christmas because there aren\u0027t enough hats!\u0027\n Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful towards the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the DA meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the DA would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood on to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron was going home to The Burrow. Harry endured several days of envy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking him how he was going to get home for Christmas: \u0027But you\u0027re coming too! Didn\u0027t I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!\u0027\n Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry\u0027s spirits soared: the thought of Christmas at The Burrow was truly wonderful, though slightly marred by Harry\u0027s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities. Even though he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place anyway, he could not help but think Mrs. Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother\u0027s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.\n Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last DA meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the torches burst into flame he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry\u0027s face and bearing the legend: \u0027HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!\u0027\n Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking as dreamy as usual.\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. \u0027These are nice, did you put them up?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027it was Dobby the house-elf.\u0027\n \u0027Mistletoe,\u0027 said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry\u0027s head. He jumped out from under it. \u0027Good thinking,\u0027 said Luna very seriously. \u0027It\u0027s often infested with Nargles.\u0027\n Harry was saved the necessity of asking what Nargles are by the arrival of Angelina, Katie and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, \u0027we\u0027ve finally replaced you.\u0027\n \u0027Replaced me?\u0027 said Harry blankly.\n \u0027You and Fred and George,\u0027 she said impatiently. \u0027We\u0027ve got another Seeker!\u0027\n \u0027Who?\u0027 said Harry quickly.\n \u0027Ginny Weasley,\u0027 said Katie.\n Harry gaped at her.\n \u0027Yeah, I know,\u0027 said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm, \u0027but she\u0027s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,\u0027 she said, throwing him a very dirty look, \u0027but as we can\u0027t have you ...\u0027\n Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?\n \u0027And what about the Beaters? he asked, trying to keep his voice even.\n \u0027Andrew Kirke,\u0027 said Alicia without enthusiasm, \u0027and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up ...\u0027\n The arrival of Ron, Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end, and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent Harry seeing Angelina\u0027s burning, reproachful looks.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said, calling them all to order. \u0027I thought this evening we should just go over the things we\u0027ve done so far, because it\u0027s the last meeting before the holidays and there\u0027s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break--\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not doing anything new?\u0027 said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. \u0027If I\u0027d known that, I wouldn\u0027t have come.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re all really sorry Harry didn\u0027t tell you, then,\u0027 said Fred loudly.\n Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\n \u0027--we can practise in pairs,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027We\u0027ll start with the Impediment Jinx, for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.\u0027\n They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of intermittent cries of \u0027Impedimenta!\u0027 People froze for a minute or so, during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.\n Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times.\n After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practising Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over.\n Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.\n At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.\n \u0027You\u0027re getting really good,\u0027 he said, beaming around at them. \u0027When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff--maybe even Patronuses.\u0027\n There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a \u0027Happy Christmas\u0027 as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027 from her.\n \u0027No, you go on,\u0027 he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam\u0027s apple.\n He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.\n He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.\n \u0027Wha--?\u0027\n He didn\u0027t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying silently.\n \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 he said, feebly.\n She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.\n \u0027I\u0027m--sorry,\u0027 she said thickly. \u0027I suppose ... it\u0027s just ... learning all this stuff ... it just makes me ... wonder whether ... if he\u0027d known it all ... he\u0027d still be alive.\u0027\n Harry\u0027s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk about Cedric.\n \u0027He did know this stuff,\u0027 Harry said heavily. \u0027He was really good at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don\u0027t stand a chance.\u0027\n She hiccoughed at the sound of Voldemort\u0027s name, but stared at Harry without flinching.\n \u0027You survived when you were just a baby,\u0027 she said quietly.\n \u0027Yeah, well,\u0027 said Harry wearily, moving towards the door, \u0027I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it\u0027s nothing to be proud of.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t go!\u0027 said Cho, sounding tearful again. \u0027I\u0027m really sorry to get all upset like this ... I didn\u0027t mean to ...\u0027\n She hiccoughed again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He\u0027d have been so pleased with just a \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027.\n \u0027I know it must be horrible for you,\u0027 she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. \u0027Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die ... I suppose you just want to forget about it?\u0027\n Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt heartless saying it.\n \u0027You\u0027re a r-really good teacher, you know,\u0027 said Cho, with a watery smile. \u0027I\u0027ve never been able to Stun anything before.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Harry awkwardly.\n They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.\n \u0027Mistletoe,\u0027 said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. His mouth was very dry. \u0027It\u0027s probably full of Nargles, though.\u0027\n \u0027What are Nargles?\u0027\n \u0027No idea,\u0027 said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to have been Stunned. \u0027You\u0027d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.\u0027\n Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer to him now. He could have counted the freckles on her nose.\n \u0027I really like you, Harry.\u0027\n He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading through him, paralysing his arms, legs and brain.\n She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes ...\n He returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his Transfiguration homework.\n \u0027What kept you?\u0027 he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione\u0027s.\n Harry didn\u0027t answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.\n \u0027Are you all right, Harry?\u0027 Hermione asked, peering at him over the tip of her quill.\n Harry gave a half-hearted shrug. In truth, he didn\u0027t know whether he was all right or not. \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027\n Harry didn\u0027t quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn\u0027t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.\n \u0027Is it Cho?\u0027 she asked in a businesslike way. \u0027Did she corner you after the meeting?\u0027\n Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.\n \u0027So--er--what did she want?\u0027 he asked in a mock casual voice.\n \u0027She--\u0027 Harry began, rather hoarsely, he cleared his throat and tried again. \u0027She--er--\u0027\n \u0027Did you kiss?\u0027 asked Hermione briskly.\n Ron sat up so fast he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug. Disregarding this completely, he stared avidly at Harry.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 he demanded.\n Harry looked from Ron\u0027s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione\u0027s slight frown, and nodded.\n \u0027HA!\u0027\n Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second-years over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry\u0027s face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug.\n Hermione gave Ron a look or deep disgust and returned to her letter.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. \u0027How was it?\u0027\n Harry considered for a moment.\n \u0027Wet,\u0027 he said truthfully.\n Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.\n \u0027Because she was crying,\u0027 Harry continued heavily.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Ron, his smile fading slightly. \u0027Are you that bad at kissing?\u0027\n \u0027Dunno,\u0027 said Harry, who hadn\u0027t considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. \u0027Maybe I am.\u0027\n \u0027Of course you\u0027re not,\u0027 said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter.\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027 said Ron very sharply.\n \u0027Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,\u0027 said Hermione vaguely. \u0027She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,\u0027 said Ron, grinning.\n \u0027Ron,\u0027 said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her inkpot, \u0027you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\u0027 said Ron indignantly. \u0027What sort of person cries while someone\u0027s kissing them?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, slightly desperately, \u0027who does?\u0027\n Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you understand how Cho\u0027s feeling at the moment?\u0027 she asked.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry and Ron together.\n Hermione sighed and laid down her quill.\n \u0027Well, obviously, she\u0027s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she\u0027s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can\u0027t work out who she likes best. Then she\u0027ll be feeling guilty, thinking it\u0027s an insult to Cedric\u0027s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she\u0027ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can\u0027t work out what her feelings towards Harry are, anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that\u0027s all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she\u0027s afraid she\u0027s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she\u0027s been flying so badly.\u0027\n A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, \u0027One person can\u0027t feel all that at once, they\u0027d explode.\u0027\n \u0027Just because you\u0027ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn\u0027t mean we all have,\u0027 said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.\n \u0027She was the one who started it,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve--she just sort of came at me--and next thing she\u0027s crying all over me--I didn\u0027t know what to do--\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t blame you, mate,\u0027 said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.\n \u0027You just had to be nice to her,\u0027 said Hermione, looking up anxiously. \u0027You were, weren\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, \u0027I sort of--patted her on the back a bit.\u0027\n Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty.\n \u0027Well, I suppose it could have been worse,\u0027 she said. \u0027Are you going to see her again?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll have to, won\u0027t I?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027We\u0027ve got DA meetings, haven\u0027t we?\u0027\n \u0027You know what I mean,\u0027 said Hermione impatiently.\n Harry said nothing. Hermione\u0027s words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho--Hogsmeade, perhaps--and being alone with her for hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened ... the thought made his stomach clench painfully.\n \u0027Oh well,\u0027 said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, \u0027you\u0027ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her.\u0027\n \u0027What if he doesn\u0027t want to ask her?\u0027 said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 said Hermione vaguely, \u0027Harry\u0027s liked her for ages, haven\u0027t you, Harry?\u0027\n He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.\n \u0027Who\u0027re you writing the novel to, anyway?\u0027 Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight.\n \u0027Viktor.\u0027\n \u0027Krum?\u0027\n \u0027How many other Viktors do we know?\u0027\n Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius\u0027s head would appear there and give him some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last ones in the common room.\n \u0027Well, night,\u0027 said Hermione, yawning widely as she set off up the girls\u0027 staircase.\n \u0027What does she see in Krum?\u0027 Ron demanded, as he and Harry climbed the boys\u0027 stairs.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Harry, considering the matter, \u0027I s\u0027pose he\u0027s older, isn\u0027t he ... and he\u0027s an international Quidditch player ...\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, but apart from that,\u0027 said Ron, sounding aggravated. \u0027I mean, he\u0027s a grouchy git, isn\u0027t he?\u0027\n \u0027Bit grouchy, yeah,\u0027 said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.\n They pulled off their robes and put on pyjamas in silence; Dean, Seamus and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four-poster; instead, he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville\u0027s bed. If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours\u0027 time he would have kissed Cho Chang ...\n \u0027Night,\u0027 grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.\n \u0027Night,\u0027 said Harry.\n Maybe next time ... if there was a next time ... she\u0027d be a bit happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him ... or was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think. Hermione\u0027s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.\n That\u0027s what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over on to his side, how girls\u0027 brains work ... it\u0027d be more useful than Divination, anyway ...\n Neville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the night.\n Harry dreamed he was back in the DA room. Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretences; she said he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog Cards if she showed up. Harry protested ... Cho shouted, \u0027Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog Cards, look!\u0027 And she pulled out fistfuls of Cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air. Then she turned into Hermione, who said, \u0027You did promise her, you know, Harry ... I think you\u0027d better give her something else instead ... how about your Firebolt?\u0027 And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt, because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he\u0027d only come to the DA room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby\u0027s head ...\n The dream changed ...\n His body felt smooth, powerful and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone ... he was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly ... it was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colours ... he was turning his head ... at first glance the corridor was empty ... but no ... a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping on to his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark ...\n Harry put out his tongue ... he tasted the man\u0027s scent on the air ... he was alive but drowsy ... sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor ..\n Harry longed to bite the man ... but he must master the impulse ... he had more important work to do ...\n But the man was stirring ... a silver Cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt ... he had no choice ... he reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man\u0027s flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood ...\n The man was yelling in pain ... then he fell silent ... he slumped backwards against the wall ... blood was splattering on to the floor ...\n His forehead hurt terribly ... it was aching fit to burst ...\n \u0027Harry! HARRY!\u0027\n He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat; his bed covers were twisted all around him like a strait-jacket; he felt as though a white-hot poker were being applied to his forehead.\n \u0027Harry!\u0027\n Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened. There were more figures at the foot of Harry\u0027s bed. He clutched his head in his hands; the pain was blinding him ... he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress.\n \u0027He\u0027s really ill,\u0027 said a scared voice. \u0027Should we call someone?\u0027\n \u0027Harry! Harry!\u0027\n He had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him ... taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him.\n \u0027Your dad,\u0027 he panted, his chest heaving. \u0027Your dad\u0027s ... been attacked ...\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Ron uncomprehendingly.\n \u0027Your dad! He\u0027s been bitten, it\u0027s serious, there was blood everywhere ...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m going for help,\u0027 said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory.\n \u0027Harry, mate,\u0027 said Ron uncertainly, \u0027you ... you were just dreaming--\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand.\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t a dream ... not an ordinary dream ... I was there, I saw it ... I did it ...\u0027\n He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backwards out of the way.\n \u0027Harry, you\u0027re not well,\u0027 he said shakily. \u0027Neville\u0027s gone for help.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m fine!\u0027 Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pyjamas and shaking uncontrollably. \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with me, it\u0027s your dad you\u0027ve got to worry about--we need to find out where he is--he\u0027s bleeding like mad--I was--it was a huge snake.\u0027\n He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar ... then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Neville\u0027s voice again.\n \u0027Over here, Professor.\u0027\n Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.\n \u0027What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?\u0027\n He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions.\n \u0027It\u0027s Ron\u0027s dad,\u0027 he said, sitting up again. \u0027He\u0027s been attacked by a snake and it\u0027s serious, I saw it happen.\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean, you saw it happen?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know ... I was asleep and then I was there ...\u0027\n \u0027You mean you dreamed this?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Harry angrily; would none of them understand? \u0027I was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid ... and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn\u0027t imagine it. Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone\u0027s got to find out where he is ...\u0027\n Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.\n \u0027I\u0027m not lying and I\u0027m not mad!\u0027 Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout. \u0027I tell you, I saw it happen!\u0027\n \u0027I believe you, Potter,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall curtly. \u0027Put on your dressing gown--we\u0027re going to see the Headmaster.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-21.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
