{"id":111679,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry had even put on his socks.\n \u0027Does he think he\u0027ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long?\u0027 asked Harry loudly as the hem of Seamus\u0027s robes wnipped out of sight.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it, Harry,\u0027 Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder, \u0027he\u0027s just ...\u0027\n But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room.\n Neville and Ron both gave Harry an it\u0027s-his-problem-not-yours look, but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this would he have to take?\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast. \u0027You look absolutely--Oh for heavens sake.\u0027\n She was staring at the common-room noticeboard, where a large new sign had been put up.\n GALLONS OF GALLEONS!\n Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?\n Like to earn a little extra gold?\n Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room,\n for simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs.\n (We regret that all work is undertaken at applicant\u0027s own risk.)\n \u0027They are the limit,\u0027 said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend, which was to be in October. \u0027We\u0027ll have to talk to them, Ron.\u0027\n Ron looked positively alarmed.\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Because we\u0027re prefects!\u0027 said Hermione, as they climbed out through the portrait hole. \u0027It\u0027s up to us to stop this kind of thing!\u0027\n Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting.\n \u0027Anyway, what\u0027s up, Harry?\u0027 Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. \u0027You look really angry about something.\u0027\n \u0027Seamus reckons Harry\u0027s lying about You-Know-Who,\u0027 said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond.\n Hermione, who Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.\n \u0027Yes, Lavender thinks so too,\u0027 she said gloomily.\n \u0027Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I\u0027m a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?\u0027 Harry said loudly.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hermione calmly. \u0027I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven\u0027t noticed, Ron and I are on your side.\u0027\n There was a short pause.\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Harry in a low voice.\n \u0027That\u0027s quite all right,\u0027 said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. \u0027Don\u0027t you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?\u0027\n Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly and Hermione sighed again.\n \u0027About You-Know-Who. He said his \"gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust--\" \u0027\n \u0027How do you remember stuff like that?\u0027 asked Ron, looking at her in admiration.\n \u0027I listen, Ron,\u0027 said Hermione, with a touch of asperity.\n \u0027So do I, but I still couldn\u0027t tell you exactly what--\u0027\n \u0027The point,\u0027 Hermione pressed on loudly, \u0027is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who\u0027s only been back two months and we\u0027ve already started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat\u0027s warning was the same: stand together, be united--\u0027\n \u0027And Harry got it right last night,\u0027 retorted Ron. \u0027If that means we\u0027re supposed to get matey with the Slytherins--fat chance.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I think it\u0027s a pity we\u0027re not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,\u0027 said Hermione crossly.\n They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the Entrance Hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.\n \u0027Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,\u0027 said Harry sarcastically.\n They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry\u0027s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud grey.\n \u0027Dumbledore didn\u0027t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman\u0027s staying,\u0027 he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.\n \u0027Maybe ...\u0027 said Hermione thoughtfully.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said both Harry and Ron together.\n \u0027Well ... maybe he didn\u0027t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here.\u0027\n \u0027What d\u0027you mean, draw attention to it?\u0027 said Ron, half-laughing. \u0027How could we not notice?\u0027\n Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to Harry.\n \u0027Hi, Angelina.\u0027\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 she said briskly, \u0027good summer?\u0027 And without waiting for an answer, \u0027Listen, I\u0027ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.\u0027\n \u0027Nice one,\u0027 said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina\u0027s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood\u0027s had been, which could only be an improvement.\n \u0027Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver\u0027s left. Tryouts are on Friday at five o\u0027clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new person\u0027ll fit in.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Harry.\n Angelina smiled at him and departed.\n \u0027I\u0027d forgotten Wood had left,\u0027 said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her. \u0027I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?\u0027\n \u0027I s\u0027pose,\u0027 said Harry, taking the bench opposite. \u0027He was a good Keeper ...\u0027\n \u0027Still, it won\u0027t hurt to have some new blood, will it?\u0027 said Ron.\n With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.\n \u0027What are you still getting that for?\u0027 said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl\u0027s leg and it took off again. \u0027I\u0027m not bothering ... load of rubbish.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s best to know what the enemy is saying,\u0027 said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate. \u0027Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.\u0027\n Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables.\n \u0027Look at today!\u0027 groaned Ron. \u0027History of Magic, double Potions, Divination and double Defence Against the Dark Arts ... Binns, Snape, Trelawney and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George\u0027d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted ...\u0027\n \u0027Do mine ears deceive me?\u0027 said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry. \u0027Hogwarts prefects surely don\u0027t wish to skive off lessons?\u0027\n \u0027Look what we\u0027ve got today,\u0027 said Ron grumpily, shoving his timetable under Fred\u0027s nose. \u0027That\u0027s the worst Monday I\u0027ve ever seen.\u0027\n \u0027Fair point, little bro,\u0027 said Fred, scanning the column. \u0027You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.\u0027\n \u0027Why\u0027s it cheap?\u0027 said Ron suspiciously.\n \u0027Because you\u0027ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven\u0027t got an antidote yet,\u0027 said George, helping himself to a kipper.\n \u0027Cheers,\u0027 said Ron moodily, pocketing his timetable, \u0027but I think I\u0027ll take the lessons.\u0027\n \u0027And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,\u0027 said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, \u0027you can\u0027t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard.\u0027\n \u0027Says who?\u0027 said George, looking astonished.\n \u0027Says me,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027And Ron.\u0027\n \u0027Leave me out of it,\u0027 said Ron hastily.\n Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.\n \u0027You\u0027ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,\u0027 said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. \u0027You\u0027re starting your fifth year, you\u0027ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.\u0027\n \u0027And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?\u0027 asked Hermione.\n \u0027Fifth year\u0027s OWL year,\u0027 said George.\n \u0027So?\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027ve got your exams coming up, haven\u0027t you? They\u0027ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they\u0027ll be rubbed raw,\u0027 said Fred with satisfaction.\n \u0027Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs,\u0027 said George happily. \u0027Tears and tantrums ... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint ...\u0027\n \u0027Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d\u0027you remember?\u0027 said Fred remmiscently.\n \u0027That\u0027s \u0027cause you put Bulbadox powder in his pyjamas,\u0027 said George.\n \u0027Oh yeah,\u0027 said Fred, grinning. \u0027I\u0027d forgotten ... hard to keep track sometimes, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Anyway, it\u0027s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,\u0027 said George. \u0027If you care about exam results, anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our peckers up somehow.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah ... you got, what was it, three OWLs each?\u0027 said Ron.\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Fred unconcernedly. \u0027But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement.\u0027\n \u0027We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,\u0027 said George brightly, \u0027now that we\u0027ve got--\u0027\n He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.\n \u0027--now that we\u0027ve got our OWLs,\u0027 George said hastily. \u0027I mean, do we really need NEWTs? But we didn\u0027t think Mum could take us leaving school early not on top of Percy turning out to be the world\u0027s biggest prat.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not going to waste our last year here, though,\u0027 said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. \u0027We\u0027re going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, then produce products to fit the demand.\u0027\n \u0027But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?\u0027 Hermione asked sceptically. \u0027You\u0027re going to need all the ingredients and materials--and premises too, I suppose ...\u0027\n Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, \u0027Ask us no questions and we\u0027ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C\u0027mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.\u0027\n Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast.\n \u0027What did that mean?\u0027 said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. \u0027\"Ask us no questions ...\" Does that mean they\u0027ve already got some gold to start a joke shop?\u0027\n \u0027You know, I\u0027ve been wondering about that,\u0027 said Ron, his brow furrowed. \u0027They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and I couldn\u0027t understand where they got the Galleons ...\u0027\n Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.\n \u0027D\u0027you reckon it\u0027s true this year\u0027s going to be really tough? Because of the exams?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027Bound to be, isn\u0027t it? OWLs are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice, too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what NEWTs you want to do next year.\u0027\n \u0027D\u0027you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?\u0027 Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom.\n \u0027Not really,\u0027 said Ron slowly. \u0027Except ... well ...\u0027\n He looked slightly sheepish.\n \u0027What?\u0027 Harry urged him.\n \u0027Well, it\u0027d be cool to be an Auror,\u0027 said Ron in an off-hand voice.\n \u0027Yeah, it would,\u0027 said Harry fervently.\n \u0027But they\u0027re, like, the elite,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027You\u0027ve got to be really good. What about you, Hermione?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said. \u0027I think I\u0027d like to do something really worthwhile.\u0027\n \u0027An Auror\u0027s worthwhile!\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Yes, it is, but it\u0027s not the only worthwhile thing,\u0027 said Hermione thoughtfully, \u0027I mean, if I could take SPEW further ...\u0027\n Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.\n History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione\u0027s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns\u0027s voice.\n Today, they suffered an hour and a half\u0027s droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher\u0027s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.\n \u0027How would it be,\u0027 she asked them coldly, as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), \u0027if I refused to lend you my notes this year?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027d fail our OWL, said Ron. \u0027If you want that on your conscience, Hermione ...\u0027\n \u0027Well, you\u0027d deserve it,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027You don\u0027t even try to listen to him, do you?\u0027\n \u0027We do try,\u0027 said Ron. \u0027We just haven\u0027t got your brains or your memory or your concentration-- you\u0027re just cleverer than we are--is it nice to rub it in?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t give me that rubbish,\u0027 said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.\n A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner towards them.\n \u0027Hello, Harry!\u0027\n It was Cho Chang and, what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you\u0027re not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.\n \u0027You got that stuff off, then?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. \u0027So, did you ... er ... have a good summer?\u0027\n The moment he had said this he wished he hadn\u0027t--Cedric had been Cho\u0027s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry\u0027s. Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, \u0027Oh, it was all right, you know ...\u0027\n \u0027Is that a Tornados badge?\u0027 Ron demanded suddenly, pointing to the front of Cho\u0027s robes, where a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold \u0027T\u0027 was pinned. \u0027You don\u0027t support them, do you?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, I do,\u0027 said Cho.\n \u0027Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?\u0027 said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.\n \u0027I\u0027ve supported them since I was six,\u0027 said Cho coolly. \u0027Anyway ... see you, Harry.\u0027\n She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.\n \u0027You are so tactless!\u0027\n \u0027What? I only asked her if--\u0027\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?\u0027\n \u0027So? She could\u0027ve done, I wasn\u0027t stopping--\u0027\n \u0027Why on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team?\u0027\n \u0027Attacking? I wasn\u0027t attacking her, I was only--\u0027\n \u0027Who cares if she supports the Tornados?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season--\u0027\n \u0027But what does it matter?\u0027\n \u0027It means they\u0027re not real fans, they\u0027re just jumping on the bandwagon--\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the bell,\u0027 said Harry dully, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snapes dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.\n And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape\u0027s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn\u0027t she? She had been Cedric\u0027s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric\u0027s death ... yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days ... and at this thought, Harry\u0027s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape\u0027s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, where he sat down between Ron and Hermione and ignored the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.\n \u0027Settle down,\u0027 said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.\n There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape\u0027s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class\u0027s silence.\n \u0027Before we begin today\u0027s lesson,\u0027 said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all, \u0027I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an \"Acceptable\" in your OWL, or suffer my ... displeasure.\u0027\n His gaze lingered this time on Neville, who gulped.\n \u0027After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,\u0027 Snape went on. \u0027I take only the very best into my NEWT Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye.\u0027\n His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.\n \u0027But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,\u0027 said Snape softly, \u0027so, whether or not you are intending to attempt NEWT, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level I have come to expect from my OWL students.\n \u0027Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be warned: if you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.\u0027 On Harry\u0027s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of utmost attention. The ingredients and method--\u0027 Snape flicked his wand \u0027--are on the blackboard--(they appeared there) \u0027--you will find everything you need--\u0027 he flicked his wand again \u0027--in the store cupboard--\u0027 (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) \u0027--you have an hour and a half ... start.\u0027\n Just as Harry, Ron and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in anti-clockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added.\n \u0027A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,\u0027 called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.\n Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam; Ron\u0027s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they seemed to be going out. The surface of Hermione\u0027s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapour, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant he could find nothing to criticise.\n At Harry\u0027s cauldron, however, Snape stopped, and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face.\n \u0027Potter, what is this supposed to be?\u0027\n The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.\n \u0027The Draught of Peace,\u0027 said Harry tensely.\n \u0027Tell me, Potter,\u0027 said Snape softly, \u0027can you read?\u0027\n Draco Malfoy laughed.\n \u0027Yes, I can,\u0027 said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.\n \u0027Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.\u0027\n Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multi-coloured steam now filling the dungeon.\n \u0027\"Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counter-clockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.\" \u0027\n His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes.\n \u0027Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry very quietly.\n \u0027I beg your pardon?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, more loudly. \u0027I forgot the hellebore.\u0027\n \u0027I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. Evanesce.\u0027\n The contents of Harry\u0027s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron.\n \u0027Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing,\u0027 said Snape. \u0027Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.\u0027\n While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron\u0027s, which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs; or Neville\u0027s, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron; yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for the day\u0027s work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape\u0027s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.\n \u0027That was really unfair,\u0027 said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd\u0027s pie. \u0027Your potion wasn\u0027t nearly as bad as Goyle\u0027s; when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, well,\u0027 said Harry, glowering at his plate, \u0027since when has Snape ever been fair to me?\u0027\n Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry\u0027s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.\n \u0027I did think he might be a bit better this year,\u0027 said Hermione in a disappointed voice. \u0027I mean ... you know ...\u0027 she looked around carefully; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table \u0027 ... now he\u0027s in the Order and everything.\u0027\n \u0027Poisonous toadstools don\u0027t change their spots,\u0027 said Ron sagely. \u0027Anyway, I\u0027ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked to trust Snape. Where\u0027s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?\u0027\n \u0027I think Dumbledore\u0027s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn\u0027t share it with you, Ron,\u0027 snapped Hermione.\n \u0027Oh, shut up, the pair of you,\u0027 said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. \u0027Can\u0027t you give it a rest?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027You\u0027re always having a go at each other, it\u0027s driving me mad.\u0027 And abandoning his shepherd\u0027s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there.\n He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione\u0027s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction. Serve them right, he thought, why can\u0027t they give it a rest ... bickering all the time ... it\u0027s enough to drive anyone up the wall ...\n He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him.\n \u0027Come back, you scurvy dog! Stand fast and fight!\u0027 yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.\n Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower. Consequently, he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney\u0027s classroom when the bell rang.\n After Potions, Divination was Harry\u0027s least favourite class, which was due mainly to Professor Trelawney\u0027s habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy putting copies of battered leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables, chairs and overstuffed pouffes.\n \u0027Hermione and me have stopped arguing,\u0027 he said, sitting down beside Harry.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 grunted Harry.\n \u0027But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,\u0027 said Ron.\n \u0027I \u0027m not--\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m just passing on the message,\u0027 said Ron, talking over him. \u0027But I reckon she\u0027s right. It\u0027s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you.\u0027\n \u0027I never said it --\u0027\n \u0027Good-day,\u0027 said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself. \u0027And welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely--as, of course, I knew you would.\n \u0027You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your OWL. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little. However, the Headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so ...\u0027\n Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations.\n \u0027Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation. Then, divide into pairs. Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each other\u0027s most recent dreams. Carry on.\u0027\n The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother\u0027s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.\n \u0027I never remember my dreams,\u0027 said Ron, \u0027you say one.\u0027\n \u0027You must remember one of them,\u0027 said Harry impatiently.\n He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Proiessor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him.\n \u0027Well, I dreamed I was playing Quidditch the other night,\u0027 said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. \u0027What d\u0027you reckon that means?\u0027\n \u0027Probably that you\u0027re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,\u0027 said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest. It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.\n \u0027D\u0027you realise how much homework we\u0027ve got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we\u0027ve got a month\u0027s dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren\u0027t wrong about OWL year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any ...\u0027\n When they entered the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teachers desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.\n The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.\n \u0027Well, good afternoon!\u0027 she said, when finally the whole class had sat down.\n A few people mumbled \u0027good afternoon\u0027 in reply.\n \u0027Tut, tut,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge. \u0027That won\u0027t do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply \"Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge\". One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!\u0027\n \u0027Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\u0027 they chanted back at her.\n \u0027There, now,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge sweetly. That wasn\u0027t too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.\u0027\n Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order \u0027wands away\u0027 had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill, ink and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:\n Defence Against the Dark Arts\n A Return to Basic Principles\n \u0027Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn\u0027t it?\u0027 stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your OWL year.\n \u0027You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centred, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.\u0027\n She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by:\n Course Aims:\n 1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.\n 2. Learning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally be used\n 3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.\n For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge\u0027s three course aims she asked, \u0027Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\u0027\n There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.\n \u0027I think we\u0027ll try that again,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge. \u0027When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply, \"Yes, Professor Umbridge\", or \"No, Professor Umbridge\". So: has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Professor Umbridge,\u0027 rang through the room.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge. \u0027I should like you to turn to page five and read \"Chapter One, Basics for Beginners\". There will be no need to talk.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher\u0027s desk, observing them all closely with those pouchy toad\u0027s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.\n It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory.She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.\n Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her enquiringly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.\n After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione\u0027s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge\u0027s eye rather than struggle on with \u0027Basics for Beginners\u0027.\n When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.\n \u0027Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?\u0027 she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.\n \u0027Not about the chapter, no,\u0027 said Hermione.\n \u0027Well, we\u0027re reading just now,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, showing her small pointed teeth. \u0027If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a query about your course aims,\u0027 said Hermione.\n Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.\n \u0027And your name is?\u0027\n \u0027Hermione Granger,\u0027 said Hermione.\n \u0027Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.\n \u0027Well, I don\u0027t,\u0027 said Hermione bluntly. \u0027There\u0027s nothing written up there about using defensive spells.\u0027\n There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.\n \u0027Using defensive spells?\u0027 Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. \u0027Why, I can\u0027t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren\u0027t expecting to be attacked during class?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re not going to use magic?\u0027 Ron exclaimed loudly.\n \u0027Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr.--?\u0027\n \u0027Weasley,\u0027 said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.\n Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge\u0027s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.\n \u0027Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Surely the whole point of Defence Against the Dark Arts is to practise defensive spells?\u0027\n \u0027Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?\u0027 asked Professor Umbridge, in her falsely sweet voice.\n \u0027No, but--\u0027\n \u0027Well then, I\u0027m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the \"whole point\" of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new programme of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way--\u0027\n \u0027What use is that?\u0027 said Harry loudly. \u0027If we\u0027re going to be attacked, it won\u0027t be in a--\u0027\n \u0027Hand,Mr Potter!\u0027 sang Professor Umbridge.\n Harry thrust his fist in the air. Again, Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him, but now several other people had their hands up, too.\n \u0027And your name is?\u0027 Professor Umbridge said to Dean.\n \u0027Dean Thomas.\u0027\n \u0027Well, Mr Thomas?\u0027\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s like Harry said, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Dean. \u0027If we\u0027re going to be attacked, it won\u0027t be risk free.\u0027\n \u0027I repeat,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, \u0027do you expect to be attacked during my classes?\u0027\n \u0027No, but--\u0027\n Professor Umbridge talked over him. \u0027I do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school,\u0027 she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, \u0027but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed--not to mention,\u0027 she gave a nasty little laugh, \u0027extremely dangerous half-breeds.\u0027\n \u0027If you mean Professor Lupin,\u0027 piped up Dean angrily, \u0027he was the best we ever--\n \u0027Hand,Mr Thomas! As I was saying--you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day--\u0027\n \u0027No we haven\u0027t,\u0027 Hermione said, \u0027we just--\u0027\n \u0027Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!\u0027\n Hermione put up her hand. Professor Umbridge turned away from her.\n \u0027It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you.\u0027\n \u0027Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn\u0027t he?\u0027 said Dean hotly. \u0027Mind you, we still learned loads.\u0027\n \u0027Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!\u0027 trilled Professor Umbridge. \u0027Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?\u0027 she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.\n \u0027Parvati Patil, and isn\u0027t there a practical bit in our Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL? Aren\u0027t we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter-curses and things?\u0027\n \u0027As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge dismissively.\n \u0027Without ever practising them beforehand?\u0027 said Parvati incredulously. \u0027Are you telling us that the first time we\u0027ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?\u0027\n \u0027I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough--\u0027\n \u0027And what good\u0027s theory going to be in the real world?\u0027 said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again.\n Professor Umbridge looked up.\n \u0027This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,\u0027 she said softly.\n \u0027So we\u0027re not supposed to be prepared for what\u0027s waiting for us out there?\u0027\n \u0027There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yeah?\u0027 said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.\n \u0027Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?\u0027 enquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.\n \u0027Hmm, let\u0027s think ...\u0027 said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice. \u0027Maybe ... Lord Voldemort?\u0027\n Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.\n \u0027Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.\u0027\n The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.\n \u0027Now, let me make a few things quite plain.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned towards them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk.\n \u0027You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead--\u0027\n \u0027He wasn\u0027t dead,\u0027 said Harry angrily, \u0027but yeah, he\u0027s returned!\u0027\n \u0027Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him. \u0027As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.\u0027\n \u0027It is NOT a lie!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I saw him, I fought him!\u0027\n \u0027Detention, Mr Potter!\u0027 said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. \u0027Tomorrow evening. Five o\u0027clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie.The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, \"Basics for Beginners\".\u0027\n Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated.\n \u0027Harry, no!\u0027 Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.\n \u0027So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?\u0027 Harry asked, his voice shaking.\n There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died. They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.\n \u0027Cedric Diggory\u0027s death was a tragic accident,\u0027 she said coldly.\n \u0027It was murder,\u0027 said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. \u0027Voldemort killed him and you know it.\u0027\n Professor Umbridge\u0027s face was quite blank. For a moment, Harry thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, \u0027Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.\u0027\n He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher\u0027s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.\n Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it.\n \u0027Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him.\n He took it from her without saying a word, turned on his heel and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, slamming the classroom door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the poltergeist, a wide-mouthed little man floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells.\n \u0027Why, it\u0027s Potty Wee Potter!\u0027 cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl.\n \u0027Get out of it, Peeves.\u0027\n \u0027Oooh, Crackpot\u0027s feeling cranky,\u0027 said Peeves, pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. \u0027What is it this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in--\u0027 Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry \u0027-- tongues?\u0027\n \u0027I said, leave me ALONE!\u0027 Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him.\n \u0027Oh, most think he\u0027s barking, the potty wee lad,\n But some are more kindly and think he\u0027s just sad,\n But Peevesy knows better and says that he\u0027s mad--\u0027\n \u0027SHUT UP!\u0027\n A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed.\n \u0027What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?\u0027 she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. \u0027Why aren\u0027t you in class?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been sent to see you,\u0027 said Harry stiffly.\n \u0027Sent? What do you mean, sent?\u0027\n He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower.\n \u0027Come in here, Potter.\u0027\n He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically behind him.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. \u0027Is this true?\u0027\n \u0027Is what true?\u0027 Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended. \u0027Professor?\u0027 he added, in an attempt to sound more polite.\n \u0027Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027You called her a liar?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, watching Harry closely. Then she said, \u0027Have a biscuit, Potter.\u0027\n \u0027Have--what?\u0027\n \u0027Have a biscuit,\u0027 she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. \u0027And sit down.\u0027\n There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion.\n Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge\u0027s note and looked very seriously at Harry.\n \u0027Potter, you need to be careful.\u0027\n Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.\n \u0027Misbehaviour in Dolores Umbridge\u0027s class could cost you much more than house points and a detention.\u0027\n \u0027What do you--?\u0027\n \u0027Potter, use your common sense,\u0027 snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her usual manner. \u0027You know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.\u0027\n The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.\n \u0027It says here she\u0027s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,\u0027 Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge\u0027s note again.\n \u0027Every evening this week!\u0027 Harry repeated, horrified. \u0027But, Professor, couldn\u0027t you--?\u0027\n \u0027No, I couldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Professor McGonagall flatly.\n \u0027But--\u0027\n \u0027She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o\u0027clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.\u0027\n \u0027But I was telling the truth!\u0027 said Harry, outraged. \u0027Voldemort is back, you know he is; Professor Dumbledore knows he is--\u0027\n \u0027For heaven\u0027s sake, Potter!\u0027 said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort\u0027s name). \u0027Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It\u0027s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!\u0027\n She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too.\n \u0027Have another biscuit,\u0027 she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.\n \u0027No, thanks,\u0027 said Harry coldly.\n \u0027Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\u0027 she snapped.\n He took one.\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 he said grudgingly.\n \u0027Didn\u0027t you listen to Dolores Umbridge\u0027s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Yeah ... she said ... progress will be prohibited or ... well, it meant that ... that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.\u0027\n Professor McGonagall eyed him closely for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her desk and held open the door for him.\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,\u0027 she said, pointing him out of her office. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-12.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
