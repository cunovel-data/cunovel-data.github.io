{"id":111670,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u0027What?\u0027 said Harry blankly.\n \u0027He left!\u0027 said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. \u0027Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! I told him I\u0027d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It\u0027s just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we haven\u0027t got time to stand around! Hurry, now, we\u0027ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!\u0027\n \u0027But--\u0027\n The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway. \u0027You\u0027re--you\u0027re a witch?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely without cover when I\u0027d warned him--\u0027\n \u0027This Mundungus has been following me? Hang on--it was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I\u0027d stationed Mr. Tibbles under a car just in case, and Mr Tibbles came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house you\u0027d gone-- and now--oh, what\u0027s Dumbledore going to say? You!\u0027 she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor. \u0027Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!\u0027\n \u0027You know Dumbledore?\u0027 said Harry, staring at her.\n \u0027Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn\u0027t know Dumbledore? But come on-- I\u0027ll be no help if they come back, I\u0027ve never so much as Transfigured a teabag.\u0027\n She stooped down, seized one of Dudley\u0027s massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged.\n \u0027Get up, you useless lump, get up!\u0027\n But Dudley either could not or would not move. He remained on the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.\n \u0027I\u0027ll do it.\u0027 Harry took hold of Dudley\u0027s arm and heaved. With an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting. His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.\n \u0027Hurry up!\u0027 said Mrs. Figg hysterically.\n Harry pulled one of Dudley\u0027s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road, sagging slightly under the weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously around the corner.\n \u0027Keep your wand out,\u0027 she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. \u0027Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there\u0027s going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... This was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of--what\u0027s that at the end of the street? Oh, it\u0027s just Mr. Prentice... Don\u0027t put your wand away, boy, don\u0027t I keep telling you I\u0027m no use?\u0027\n It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He was slumped on Harry\u0027s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground.\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me you\u0027re a Squib, Mrs. Figg?\u0027 asked Harry, panting with the effort to keep walking. \u0027All those times I came round your house--why didn\u0027t you say anything?\u0027\n \u0027Dumbledore\u0027s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I\u0027m sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they\u0027d thought you enjoyed it. It wasn\u0027t easy, you know ... but oh my word,\u0027 she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, \u0027when Dumbledore hears about this--how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight--where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what\u0027s happened? I can\u0027t Apparate--\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve got an owl, you can borrow her,\u0027 Harry groaned, wondering whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley\u0027s weight.\n \u0027Harry, you don\u0027t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they\u0027ll know already, you mark my words--\u0027\n \u0027But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic--they\u0027re going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, surely?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, my dear, I wish it were so, but I\u0027m afraid-- MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!\u0027\n There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them. He had short, bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound. He was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognised at once as an Invisibility Cloak.\n \u0027 \u0027S\u0027 up, Figgy?\u0027 he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. \u0027What \u0027appened to staying undercover?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll give you undercover!\u0027 cried Mrs. Figg. \u0027Dementors, you useless, skiving sneak thief!\u0027\n \u0027Dementors?\u0027 repeated Mundungus, aghast. \u0027Dementors, here?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!\u0027 shrieked Mrs. Figg. \u0027Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!\u0027\n \u0027Blimey,\u0027 said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to Harry, and back again. \u0027Blimey, I...\u0027\n \u0027And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn\u0027t I tell you not to go? Didn\u0027t I?\u0027\n \u0027I--well, I--\u0027 Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. \u0027It ... it was a very good business opportunity, see...\u0027\n Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.\n \u0027Ouch--gerroff-- gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone\u0027s gotta tell Dumbledore!\u0027\n \u0027Yes--they-- have!\u0027 yelled Mrs. Figg, swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. \u0027And--it--had--better--be--you--and--you--can--tell-- him--why--you--weren\u0027t--there--to--help!\u0027\n \u0027Keep your \u0027airnet on!\u0027 said Mundungus, his arms over his head, cowering. \u0027I\u0027m going, I\u0027m going!\u0027\n And with another loud crack, he vanished.\n \u0027I hope Dumbledore murders him!\u0027 said Mrs. Figg furiously. \u0027Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?\u0027\n Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley\u0027s bulk. He gave the semi-conscious Dudley a heave and staggered onwards.\n \u0027I\u0027ll take you to the door,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet Drive. \u0027Just in case there are more of them around.... Oh my word, what a catastrophe ... and you had to fight them off yourself ... and Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs.... Well, it\u0027s no good crying over spilt potion, I suppose ... but the cat\u0027s among the pixies now...\u0027\n \u0027So,\u0027 Harry panted, \u0027Dumbledore\u0027s ... been having ... me followed?\u0027\n \u0027Of course he has,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg impatiently. \u0027Did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent.... Right ... get inside and stay there,\u0027 she said, as they reached number four. \u0027I expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.\u0027\n \u0027What are you going to do?\u0027 asked Harry quickly.\n \u0027I\u0027m going straight home,\u0027 said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark street and shuddering. \u0027I\u0027ll need to wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. Goodnight.\u0027\n \u0027Hang on, don\u0027t go yet! I want to know--\u0027\n But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking.\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Harry shouted after her. He had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four\u0027s garden path.\n The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell and watched Aunt Petunia\u0027s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.\n \u0027Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite--quite-- Diddy, what\u0027s the matter?\u0027\n Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time. Dudley swayed on the spot for a moment, his face pale green ... then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat.\n \u0027DIDDY! Diddy, what\u0027s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!\u0027\n Harry\u0027s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated. He hurried forwards to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.\n \u0027He\u0027s ill, Vernon!\u0027\n \u0027What is it, son? What\u0027s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you something foreign for tea?\u0027\n \u0027Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on the ground?\u0027\n \u0027Hang on--you haven\u0027t been mugged, have you, son?\u0027\n Aunt Petunia screamed.\n \u0027Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy! What did they do to you?\u0027\n In all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and, while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs.\n \u0027Who did it, son? Give us names. We\u0027ll get them, don\u0027t worry.\u0027\n \u0027Shh! He\u0027s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!\u0027\n Harry\u0027s foot was on the bottom-most stair when Dudley found his voice.\n \u0027Him.\u0027\n Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the explosion.\n \u0027BOY! COME HERE!\u0027\n With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.\n The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammy-looking. Uncle Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.\n \u0027What have you done to my son?\u0027 he said in a menacing growl.\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn\u0027t believe him.\n \u0027What did he do to you, Diddy?\u0027 Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley\u0027s leather jacket. \u0027Was it--was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use--his thing?\u0027\n Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t!\u0027 Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists. \u0027I didn\u0027t do anything to him, it wasn\u0027t me, it was--\u0027\n But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon\u0027s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry\u0027s feet, turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.\n \u0027OWLS!\u0027 bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. \u0027OWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!\u0027\n But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam\u0027s apple.\n Dear Mr. Potter,\n We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.\n The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.\n As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks\u0027 Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on the twelfth of August.\n Hoping you are well,\n Yours sincerely,\n Mafalda Hopkirk\n Improper Use of Magic Office\n Ministry of Magic\n Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking. Inside his head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back.\n He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley who was retching again.\n Harry\u0027s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run--now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn\u0027t know but he was certain of one thing: at Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen.\n \u0027Where d\u0027you think you\u0027re going?\u0027 yelled Uncle Venon. When Harry didn\u0027t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. \u0027I haven\u0027t finished with you, boy!\u0027\n \u0027Get out of the way,\u0027 said Harry quietly.\n \u0027You\u0027re going to stay here and explain how my son--\u0027\n \u0027If you don\u0027t get out of the way I\u0027m going to jinx you,\u0027 said Harry, raising the wand.\n \u0027You can\u0027t pull that one on me!\u0027 snarled Uncle Vernon. \u0027I know you\u0027re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!\u0027\n The madhouse has chucked me out,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027So I can do whatever I like. You\u0027ve got three seconds. One--two--\u0027\n A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen. Aunt Petunia screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He spotted it at once: a dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed window.\n Ignoring Uncle Vernon\u0027s anguished yell of \u0027OWLS!\u0027 Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open. The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had taken the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.\n Harry--\n Dumbledore\u0027s just arrived at the Ministry and he\u0027s trying to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE\u0027S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.\n Arthur Weasley\n Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out ... what did that mean? how much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry\u0027s chest, almost immediately strangled by panic--how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic? He\u0027d have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he\u0027d be lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion.\n His mind was racing.... He could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here. He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart ... and, after all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before....\n \u0027Right,\u0027 Harry said, \u0027I\u0027ve changed my mind, I\u0027m staying.\u0027\n He flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever.\n \u0027Who are all these ruddy owls from?\u0027 he growled.\n \u0027The first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,\u0027 said Harry calmly. He was straining his ears to catch any noises outside, in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon\u0027s questions than to have him start raging and bellowing. The second one was from my friend Ron\u0027s dad, who works at the Ministry.\u0027\n \u0027Ministry of Magic?\u0027 bellowed Uncle Vernon. \u0027People like you in government? Oh, this explains everything, everything, no wonder the country\u0027s going to the dogs....\u0027\n When Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then spat out, \u0027And why have you been expelled?\u0027\n \u0027Because I did magic.\u0027\n \u0027AHA!\u0027 roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley\u0027s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. \u0027So you admit it! What did you do to Dudley?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 said Harry, slightly less calmly. \u0027That wasn\u0027t me--\u0027\n \u0027Was,\u0027 muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quieten him while they both bent low over Dudley.\n \u0027Go on, son,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, \u0027what did he do?\u0027\n \u0027Tell us, darling,\u0027 whispered Aunt Petunia.\n \u0027Pointed his wand at me,\u0027 Dudley mumbled.\n \u0027Yeah, I did, but I didn\u0027t use--\u0027 Harry began angrily, but...\n \u0027SHUT UP!\u0027 roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison.\n \u0027Go on, son,\u0027 repeated Uncle Vernon, moustache blowing about furiously.\n \u0027All dark,\u0027 Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. \u0027Everything dark. And then I h-heard ... things. Inside m-my head...\u0027\n Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favourite thing in the world was magic, closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.\n \u0027What sort of things did you hear, popkin?\u0027 breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.\n But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life.... What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear?\n \u0027How come you fell over, son?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person.\n \u0027T-tripped,\u0027 said Dudley shakily. \u0027And then--\u0027\n He gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.\n \u0027Horrible,\u0027 croaked Dudley. \u0027Cold. Really cold.\u0027\n \u0027OK,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley\u0027s forehead to feel his temperature. \u0027What happened then, Dudders?\u0027\n \u0027Felt ... felt ... felt ... as if ... as if...\u0027\n \u0027As if you\u0027d never be happy again,\u0027 Harry supplied dully.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Dudley whispered, still trembling.\n \u0027So!\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up. \u0027You put some crackpot spell on my on so he\u0027d hear voices and believe he was--was doomed to misery, or something, did you?\u0027\n \u0027How many times do I have to tell you?\u0027 said Harry, temper and voice both rising. \u0027It wasn\u0027t me! It was a couple of dementors!\u0027\n \u0027A couple of--what\u0027s this codswallop?\u0027\n \u0027De--men--tors,\u0027 said Harry slowly and clearly. \u0027Two of them.\u0027\n \u0027And what the ruddy hell are dementors?\u0027\n \u0027They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia.\n Two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry\u0027s brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing--butAunt Petunia?\n \u0027How d\u0027you know that?\u0027 he asked her, astonished.\n Aunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth.\n \u0027I heard--that awful boy--telling her about them--years ago,\u0027 she said jerkily.\n \u0027If you mean my mum and dad, why don\u0027t you use their names?\u0027 said Harry loudly but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.\n Harry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry\u0027s mother had been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn\u0027t exist.\n Uncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, \u0027So--so--they--er--they--er--they actually exist, do they--er-- Dementy-whatsits?\u0027\n Aunt Petunia nodded.\n Uncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout \u0027April Fool!\u0027 When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening. It zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannon-ball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl\u0027s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night.\n \u0027Enough--effing--owls...\u0027 muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.\n Dear Mr. Potter,\n Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of August, at which time an official decision will be taken.\n Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries.\n With best wishes,\n Yours sincerely,\n Mafalda Hopkirk\n Improper Use of Magic Office\n Ministry of Magic\n Harry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings. \u0027What now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?\u0027 he added as a hopeful afterthought.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to go to a hearing,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027And they\u0027ll sentence you there?\u0027\n \u0027I suppose so.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t give up hope, then,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon nastily.\n \u0027Well, if that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione or Sirius.\n \u0027NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!\u0027 bellowed Uncle Vernon. \u0027SIT BACK DOWN!\u0027\n \u0027What now?\u0027 said Harry impatiently.\n \u0027DUDLEY!\u0027 roared Uncle Vernon. \u0027I want to know exactly what happened to my son!\u0027\n \u0027FINE!\u0027 yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.\n \u0027Dudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,\u0027 said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper. \u0027Dudley thought he\u0027d be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but didn\u0027t use it. Then two dementors turned up--\u0027\n \u0027But what ARE Dementoids?\u0027 asked Uncle Vernon furiously. \u0027What do they DO?\u0027\n \u0027I told you--they suck all the happiness out of you,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027and if they get the chance, they kiss you--\u0027\n \u0027Kiss you?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. \u0027Kiss you?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.\u0027\n Aunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.\n \u0027His soul? They didn\u0027t take--he\u0027s still got his--\u0027\n She seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.\n \u0027Of course they didn\u0027t get his soul, you\u0027d know if they had,\u0027 said Harry, exasperated.\n \u0027Fought \u0027em off, did you, son?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood. \u0027Gave \u0027em the old one-two, did you?\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t give a Dementor the old one-two,\u0027 said Harry through clenched teeth.\n \u0027Why\u0027s he all right, then?\u0027 blustered Uncle Vernon. \u0027Why isn\u0027t he all empty, then?\u0027\n \u0027Because I used the Patronus--\u0027\n WHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.\n \u0027FOR GOD\u0027S SAKE!\u0027 roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache, something he hadn\u0027t been driven to do in a long time. \u0027I WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!\u0027\n But Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl\u0027s leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything--the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out--that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius\u0027s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernons ongoing rant about owls, and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius\u0027s message.\n Arthur has just told us what\u0027s happened. Don\u0027t leave the house again, whatever you do.\n Harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing else.\n And now his temper was rising again. Wasn\u0027t anybody going to say \u0027well done\u0027 for fighting off two dementors single-handed? Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he\u0027d misbehaved, and were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.\n \u0027--a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house. I won\u0027t have it, boy, I won\u0027t--\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t stop the owls coming,\u0027 Harry snapped, crushing Sirius\u0027s letter in his fist.\n \u0027I want the truth about what happened tonight!\u0027 barked Uncle Vernon. \u0027If it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you\u0027ve been expelled? You did you-know-what, you\u0027ve admitted, it!\u0027\n Harry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, and away from the Dursleys.\n \u0027I did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,\u0027 he said, forcing himself to remain calm. \u0027It\u0027s the only thing that works against them.\u0027\n \u0027But what were Dementoids doing in Little Whinging?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon in an outraged tone.\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t tell you,\u0027 said Harry wearily. \u0027No idea.\u0027\n His head was pounding in the glare of the strip-lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.\n \u0027It\u0027s you,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \u0027It\u0027s got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You\u0027ve got to be the only--the only--\u0027 Evidently, he couldn\u0027t bring himself to say the word \u0027wizard\u0027. The only you-know-what for miles.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know why they were here.\u0027\n But at Uncle Vernon\u0027s words, Harry\u0027s exhausted brain had ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors? Had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?\n \u0027These demembers guard some weirdo prison?\u0027 asked Uncle Vernon, lumbering along in the wake of Harry\u0027s train of thought.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry.\n If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think....\n \u0027Oho! They were coming to arrest you!\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. \u0027That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it, boy? You\u0027re on the run from the law!\u0027\n \u0027Of course I\u0027m not,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now.\n \u0027Then why--?\u0027\n \u0027He must have sent them,\u0027 said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.\n \u0027What\u0027s that? Who must have sent them?\u0027\n \u0027Lord Voldemort,\u0027 said Harry.\n He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced and squawked if they heard words like \u0027wizard\u0027, \u0027magic\u0027 or \u0027wand\u0027, could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.\n \u0027Lord--hang on,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes. \u0027I\u0027ve heard that name ... that was the one who...\u0027\n \u0027Murdered my parents, yes,\u0027 Harry said dully.\n \u0027But he\u0027s gone,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry\u0027s parents might be a painful topic. \u0027That giant bloke said so. He\u0027s gone.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s back,\u0027 said Harry heavily.\n It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia\u0027s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have breached the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry\u0027s two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside-down; the Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world, and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging, and he might never return to Hogwarts. Harry\u0027s head throbbed more painfully.\n \u0027Back?\u0027 whispered Aunt Petunia.\n She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother\u0027s sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sisters) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry\u0027s life--that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon--seemed to have fallen away.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. He came back a month ago. I saw him.\u0027\n Her hands found Dudley\u0027s massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.\n \u0027Hang on,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. \u0027Hang on. This Lord Voldything\u0027s back, you say.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027The one who murdered your parents.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And now he\u0027s sending dismembers after you?\u0027\n \u0027Looks like it,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry\u0027s eyes. \u0027Well, that settles it,\u0027 he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, \u0027you can get out of this house, boy!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027You heard me--OUT!\u0027 Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped. \u0027OUT! OUT! I should\u0027ve done this years ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudley\u0027s tail, Marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying Ford Anglia--OUT! OUT! You\u0027ve had it! You\u0027re history! You\u0027re not staying here if some loony\u0027s after you, you\u0027re not endangering my wife and son, you\u0027re not bringing trouble down on us, if you\u0027re going the same way as your useless parents, I\u0027ve had it! OUT!\u0027\n Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr. Weasley and Sirius were all crushed in his left hand. Don\u0027t leave the house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE\u0027S HOUSE.\n \u0027You heard me!\u0027 said Uncle Vernon, bending forwards now, his massive purple face coming so close to Harry\u0027s, he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face. \u0027Get going! You were all keen to leave half an hour ago! I\u0027m right behind you! Get out and never darken our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place, I don\u0027t know, Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage. We were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you\u0027ve been rotten from the beginning and I\u0027ve had enough--OWLS!\u0027\n The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight back up the chimney.\n Harry darted forwards to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him to it.\n \u0027You can open it if you like,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but I\u0027ll hear what it says anyway. That\u0027s a Howler.\u0027\n \u0027Let go of it, Petunia!\u0027 roared Uncle Vernon. \u0027Don\u0027t touch it, it could be dangerous!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s addressed to me,\u0027 said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. \u0027It\u0027s addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive--\u0027\n She caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to smoke.\n \u0027Open it!\u0027 Harry urged her. \u0027Get it over with! It\u0027ll happen anyway.\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n Aunt Petunia\u0027s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late--the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.\n An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.\n \u0027REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.\u0027\n Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence.\n \u0027What is this?\u0027 Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. \u0027What--I don\u0027t--Petunia?\u0027\n Aunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiralled horribly. Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst.\n \u0027Petunia, dear?\u0027 said Uncle Vernon timidly. \u0027P-Petunia?\u0027\n She raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.\n \u0027The boy--the boy will have to stay, Vernon,\u0027 she said weakly.\n \u0027W-what?\u0027\n \u0027He stays,\u0027 she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her feet again.\n \u0027He ... but Petunia...\u0027\n \u0027If we throw him out, the neighbours will talk,\u0027 she said. She was rapidly regaining her usual brisk, snappish manner, though she was still very pale. \u0027They\u0027ll ask awkward questions, they\u0027ll want to know where he\u0027s gone. We\u0027ll have to keep him.\u0027\n Uncle Vernon was deflating like an old tyre.\n \u0027But Petunia, dear--\u0027\n Aunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.\n \u0027You\u0027re to stay in your room,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re not to leave the house. Now get to bed.\u0027\n Harry didn\u0027t move.\n \u0027Who was that Howler from?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t ask questions,\u0027 Aunt Petunia snapped.\n \u0027Are you in touch with wizards?\u0027\n \u0027I told you to get to bed!\u0027\n \u0027What did it mean? Remember the last what?\u0027\n \u0027Go to bed!\u0027\n \u0027How come--?\u0027\n \u0027YOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GO UP TO BED!\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-2.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \n \n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
