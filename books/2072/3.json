{"id":111671,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I\u0027ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from Hogwarts. I want to know what\u0027s going on and when I\u0027m going to get out of here.\\n\\n Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His back ached from hauling Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.\\n\\n Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic--and still no one was telling him what was going on.\\n\\n And what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?\\n\\n Why was he still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don\u0027t do any more magic, stay in the house...\\n\\n He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.\\n\\n Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.\\n\\n \u0027About time!\u0027 Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage. \u0027You can put that down, I\u0027ve got work for you!\u0027\\n\\n Hedwig\u0027s large, round, amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak.\\n\\n \u0027Come here,\u0027 said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. \u0027Take these straight to Sirius, Ron and Hermione and don\u0027t come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they\u0027ve written decent-length answers if you\u0027ve got to. Understand?\u0027\\n\\n Hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, her beak still full of frog.\\n\\n \u0027Get going, then,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n She took off immediately. The moment she\u0027d gone, Harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he\u0027d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he\u0027d make it up to her when she came back with the answers from Sirius, Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn\u0027t possibly ignore a Dementor attack. He\u0027d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.\\n\\n But Hedwig didn\u0027t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn\u0027t see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he\u0027d perform more illegal magic.\\n\\n So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.\\n\\n What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged.... Might he be able to move into Sirius\u0027s house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.\\n\\n On the fourth night after Hedwig\u0027s departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going out,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We--that is to say, your aunt, Dudley and I--are going out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.\\n\\n \u0027You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are not to steal food from the fridge.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am going to lock your door.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do that.\u0027\\n\\n Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon\u0027s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.\\n\\n Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.\\n\\n The empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.\\n\\n Then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.\\n\\n He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn\u0027t be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn\u0027t heard their car.\\n\\n There was silence for a few seconds, then voices.\\n\\n Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed on to his feet--but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so.\\n\\n He snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment, he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.\\n\\n Harry stood motionless, staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a moment, then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs.\\n\\n His heart shot upwards into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.\\n\\n \u0027Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone\u0027s eye out,\u0027 said a low, growling voice.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.\\n\\n \u0027Professor Moody?\u0027 he said uncertainly.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know so much about \"Professor\",\u0027 growled the voice, \u0027never got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.\u0027\\n\\n Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody\u0027s company only to find out that it wasn\u0027t Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Harry. We\u0027ve come to take you away.\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s heart leapt. He knew that voice, too, though he hadn\u0027t heard it for over a year.\\n\\n \u0027P-Professor Lupin?\u0027 he said disbelievingly. \u0027Is that you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why are we all standing in the dark?\u0027 said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman\u0027s. \u0027Lumos.\u0027\\n\\n A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing up at him intently, some craning their heads for a better look.\\n\\n Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more grey hairs than when Harry had last said good-bye to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back despite his state of shock.\\n\\n \u0027Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,\u0027 said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet. \u0027Wotcher, Harry!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,\u0027 said a bald black wizard standing furthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear. \u0027He looks exactly like James.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Except the eyes,\u0027 said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back. \u0027Lily\u0027s eyes.\u0027\\n\\n Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. One eye was small, dark and beady, the other large, round and electric blue--the magical eye that could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody\u0027s own head.\\n\\n \u0027Are you quite sure it\u0027s him, Lupin?\u0027 he growled. \u0027It\u0027d be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry, what form does your Patronus take?\u0027 Lupin asked.\\n\\n \u0027A stag,\u0027 said Harry nervously.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s him, Mad-Eye,\u0027 said Lupin.\\n\\n Very conscious of everybody still staring at him, Harry descended the stairs, stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t put your wand there, boy!\u0027 roared Moody. \u0027What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who d\u0027you know who\u0027s lost a buttock?\u0027 the violet-haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly.\\n\\n \u0027Never you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!\u0027 growled Mad-Eye. \u0027Elementary wand-safety, nobody bothers about it any more.\u0027 He stumped off towards the kitchen. \u0027And I saw that,\u0027 he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling.\\n\\n Lupin held out his hand and shook Harry\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027How are you?\u0027 he asked, looking closely at Harry.\\n\\n \u0027F-fine...\u0027\\n\\n Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as though this was a long-standing arrangement. He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m--you\u0027re really lucky the Dursleys are out...\u0027 he mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027Lucky, ha!\u0027 said the violet-haired woman. \u0027It was me who lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they\u0027d been short-listed for the All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. They\u0027re heading off to the prize-giving right now.... Or they think they are.\u0027\\n\\n Harry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon\u0027s face when he realised there was no All-England Best Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.\\n\\n \u0027We are leaving, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Soon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Almost at once,\u0027 said Lupin, \u0027we\u0027re just waiting for the all-clear.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are we going? The Burrow?\u0027 Harry asked hopefully.\\n\\n \u0027Not The Burrow, no,\u0027 said Lupin, motioning Harry towards the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. \u0027Too risky. We\u0027ve set up Headquarters somewhere un-detectable. It\u0027s taken a while....\u0027\\n\\n Mad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys\u0027 many labour-saving appliances.\\n\\n \u0027This is Alastor Moody, Harry,\u0027 Lupin continued, pointing towards Moody.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I know,\u0027 said Harry uncomfortably. It felt odd to be introduced to somebody he\u0027d thought he\u0027d known for a year.\\n\\n \u0027And this is Nymphadora--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t call me Nymphadora, Remus,\u0027 said the young witch with a shudder, \u0027it\u0027s Tonks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,\u0027 finished Lupin.\\n\\n \u0027So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora,\u0027 muttered Tonks.\\n\\n \u0027And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt\u0027--he indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed--\u0027Elphias Doge\u0027--the wheezy-voiced wizard nodded--\u0027Dedalus Diggle--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve met before,\u0027 squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his violet-coloured top hat.\\n\\n \u0027--Emmeline Vance\u0027--a stately-looking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her head--\u0027Sturgis Podmore\u0027--a square-jawed wizard with thick straw-coloured hair winked--\u0027and Hestia Jones.\u0027 A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.\\n\\n Harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it was as though he had suddenly been ushered on-stage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.\\n\\n \u0027A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,\u0027 said Lupin, as though he had read Harry\u0027s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well, the more the better,\u0027 said Moody darkly. \u0027We\u0027re your guard, Potter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re just waiting for the signal to tell us it\u0027s safe to set off,\u0027 said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. \u0027We\u0027ve got about fifteen minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very clean, aren\u0027t they, these Muggles?\u0027 said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. \u0027My dad\u0027s Muggle-born and he\u0027s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just as it does with wizards?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er--yeah,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Look\u0027--he turned back to Lupin--\u0027what\u0027s going on, I haven\u0027t heard anything from anyone, what\u0027s Vol--?\u0027\\n\\n Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, \u0027Shut up!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not discussing anything here, it\u0027s too risky,\u0027 said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry. His magical eye remained focused on the ceiling. \u0027Damn it,\u0027 he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, \u0027it keeps getting stuck--ever since that scum wore it--\u0027\\n\\n And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.\\n\\n \u0027Mad-Eye, you do know that\u0027s disgusting, don\u0027t you?\u0027 said Tonks conversationally.\\n\\n \u0027Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,\u0027 requested Moody.\\n\\n Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.\\n\\n \u0027Cheers,\u0027 said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. \u0027I want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027re we getting--wherever we\u0027re going?\u0027 Harry asked.\\n\\n \u0027Brooms,\u0027 said Lupin. \u0027Only way. You\u0027re too young to Apparate, they\u0027ll be watching the Floo Network and it\u0027s more than our life\u0027s worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Remus says you\u0027re a good flier,\u0027 said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s excellent,\u0027 said Lupin, who was checking his watch. \u0027Anyway, you\u0027d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll come and help you,\u0027 said Tonks brightly.\\n\\n She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest.\\n\\n \u0027Funny place,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s a bit too clean, d\u0027you know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,\u0027 she added, as they entered Harry\u0027s bedroom and he turned on the light.\\n\\n His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he\u0027d tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside; Hedwig\u0027s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell; and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards\u0027 robes that had spilled on to the floor around it.\\n\\n Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.\\n\\n \u0027You know, I don\u0027t think violet\u0027s really my colour,\u0027 she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. \u0027D\u0027you think it makes me look a bit peaky?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er--\u0027 said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, it does,\u0027 said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.\\n\\n \u0027How did you do that?\u0027 said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a Metamorphmagus,\u0027 she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. \u0027It means I can change my appearance at will,\u0027 she added, spotting Harry\u0027s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. \u0027I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re an Auror?\u0027 said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark-wizard-catcher was the only career he\u0027d ever considered after Hogwarts.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Tonks, looking proud. \u0027Kingsley is as well; he\u0027s a bit higher up than me, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking. I\u0027m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?\u0027 Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.\\n\\n Tonks chuckled.\\n\\n \u0027Bet you wouldn\u0027t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry\u0027s forehead.\\n\\n \u0027No, I wouldn\u0027t mind,\u0027 Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like people staring at his scar.\\n\\n \u0027Well, you\u0027ll have to learn the hard way, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 said Tonks. \u0027Metamorphmagi are really rare, they\u0027re born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand, or potions, to change their appearance. But we\u0027ve got to get going, Harry, we\u0027re supposed to be packing,\u0027 she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Oh--yeah,\u0027 said Harry, grabbing a few more books.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid, it\u0027ll be much quicker if I--pack!\u0027 cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.\\n\\n Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not very neat,\u0027 said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. \u0027My mum\u0027s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly--she even gets the socks to fold themselves--but I\u0027ve never mastered how she does it--it\u0027s a kind of flick--\u0027 She flicked her wand hopefully.\\n\\n One of Harry\u0027s socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, well,\u0027 said Tonks, slamming the trunk\u0027s lid shut, \u0027at least it\u0027s all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too.\u0027 She pointed her wand at Hedwig\u0027s cage. \u0027Scourgify.\u0027 A few feathers and droppings vanished. \u0027Well, that\u0027s a bit better-- I\u0027ve never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells. Right--got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A Firebolt!\u0027\\n\\n Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry\u0027s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international-standard broomstick.\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,\u0027 said Tonks enviously. \u0027Ah well ... wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? OK, let\u0027s go. Locomotor trunk.\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a conductors baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig\u0027s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.\\n\\n Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick to look at it. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys.\\n\\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. \u0027We\u0027ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we\u0027re ready. Harry, I\u0027ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They won\u0027t,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027--that you\u0027re safe--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027ll just depress them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027--and you\u0027ll see them next summer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do I have to?\u0027\\n\\n Lupin smiled but made no answer.\\n\\n \u0027Come here, boy,\u0027 said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand. \u0027I need to Disillusion you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You need to what?\u0027 said Harry nervously.\\n\\n \u0027Disillusionment Charm,\u0027 said Moody, raising his wand. \u0027Lupin says you\u0027ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won\u0027t stay on while we\u0027re flying; this\u0027ll disguise you better. Here you go--\u0027\\n\\n He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.\\n\\n \u0027Nice one, Mad-Eye,\u0027 said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry\u0027s midriff.\\n\\n Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn\u0027t look anything like his any more. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.\\n\\n They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernon\u0027s beautifully kept lawn.\\n\\n \u0027Clear night,\u0027 grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. \u0027Could\u0027ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,\u0027 he barked at Harry, \u0027we\u0027re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks\u0027ll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin\u0027ll be covering you from below. I\u0027m going to be behind you. The rest\u0027ll be circling us. We don\u0027t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that likely?\u0027 Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him.\\n\\n \u0027--the others keep flying, don\u0027t stop, don\u0027t break ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they\u0027ll join you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he\u0027ll think we\u0027re not taking this seriously,\u0027 said Tonks, as she strapped Harry\u0027s trunk and Hedwig\u0027s cage into a harness hanging from her broom.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m just telling the boy the plan,\u0027 growled Moody. \u0027Our job\u0027s to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt--\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No one\u0027s going to die,\u0027 said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice.\\n\\n \u0027Mount your brooms, that\u0027s the first signal!\u0027 said Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky.\\n\\n Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars. Harry recognised them at once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.\\n\\n \u0027Second signal, let\u0027s go!\u0027 said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them.\\n\\n Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he\u0027d been fantasising about all summer, he was going home.... For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.\\n\\n \u0027Hard left, hard left, there\u0027s a Muggle looking up!\u0027 shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. \u0027We need more height.... Give it another quarter of a mile!\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards: he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon\u0027s car.... The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition ... and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy.\\n\\n \u0027Bearing south!\u0027 shouted Mad-Eye. \u0027Town ahead!\u0027\\n\\n They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below.\\n\\n \u0027Bear southeast and keep climbing, there\u0027s some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!\u0027 called Moody.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re not going through clouds!\u0027 shouted Tonks angrily, \u0027we\u0027ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!\u0027\\n\\n Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt\u0027s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.\\n\\n They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye\u0027s instructions. Harry\u0027s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least.\\n\\n \u0027Turning southwest!\u0027 yelled Moody. \u0027We want to avoid the motorway!\u0027\\n\\n Harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of travelling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames.... Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight.... Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right ... then she, too, swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore....\\n\\n \u0027We ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we\u0027re not being followed!\u0027 Moody shouted.\\n\\n \u0027ARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?\u0027 Tonks screamed from the front. \u0027We\u0027re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off-course we\u0027re not going to get there until next week! Besides, we\u0027re nearly there now!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Time to start the descent!\u0027 came Lupin\u0027s voice. \u0027Follow Tonks, Harry!\u0027\\n\\n Harry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys and television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.\\n\\n \u0027Here we go!\u0027 called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.\\n\\n Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry\u0027s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.\\n\\n \u0027Where are we?\u0027 Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, \u0027In a minute.\u0027\\n\\n Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold.\\n\\n \u0027Got it,\u0027 he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it.\\n\\n The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out; he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.\\n\\n \u0027Borrowed it from Dumbledore,\u0027 growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer. \u0027That\u0027ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now come on, quick.\u0027\\n\\n He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road and on to the pavement; Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry\u0027s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with their wands out, flanking them.\\n\\n The muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment towards Harry\u0027s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. \u0027Read quickly and memorise.\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said:\\n\\n The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-3.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) \\n \\n Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
