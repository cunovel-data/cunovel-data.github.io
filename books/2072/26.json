{"id":111691,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita\u0027s interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, \u0027--and of course, that\u0027ll be a very important story, so Harry\u0027s might have to wait for the following issue,\u0027 said Luna. Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned. Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He wondered how people would react to the story. He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether or not it worked ... \u0027Can\u0027t wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,\u0027 said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on Dean\u0027s other side, but Harry knew he was listening. \u0027It\u0027s the right thing to do, Harry,\u0027 said Neville, who was sitting opposite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, \u0027It must have been ... tough ... talking about it ... was it?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 mumbled Harry, \u0027but people have got to know what Voldemort\u0027s capable of, haven\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Neville, nodding, \u0027and his Death Eaters, too ... people should know ...\u0027 Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry\u0027s eye he looked quickly back at his plate again. After a while, Dean, Seamus and Neville departed for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice. Cho Chang walked into the Hall with her friend Marietta. Harry\u0027s stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table, and sat down with her back to him. \u0027Oh, I forgot to ask you,\u0027 said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, \u0027what happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early?\u0027 \u0027Er ... well, it was ...\u0027 said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds, \u0027a complete fiasco, now you mention it.\u0027 And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot\u0027s teashop. \u0027... so then,\u0027 he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, \u0027she jumps up, right, and says, \"I\u0027ll see you around, Harry,\" and runs out of the place!\u0027 He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione. \u0027I mean, what was all that about? What was going on?\u0027 Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho\u0027s head and sighed. \u0027Oh, Harry,\u0027 she said sadly. \u0027Well, I\u0027m sorry but you were a bit tactless.\u0027 \u0027Me, tactless?\u0027 said Harry, outraged. \u0027One minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid teashop--how was I supposed to feel about that?\u0027 \u0027Well, you see,\u0027 said Hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an over-emotional toddler, \u0027you shouldn\u0027t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.\u0027 \u0027But, but,\u0027 spluttered Harry, \u0027but--you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her?\u0027 \u0027You should have told her differently,\u0027 said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air. \u0027You should have said it was really annoying, but I\u0027d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn\u0027t want to go, you\u0027d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you and hopefully you\u0027d be able to get away more quickly. And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am, too,\u0027 Hermione added as an afterthought. \u0027But I don\u0027t think you\u0027re ugly,\u0027 said Harry, bemused. Hermione laughed. \u0027Harry, you\u0027re worse than Ron ... well, no, you\u0027re not,\u0027 she sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. \u0027Look--you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.\u0027 \u0027Is that what she was doing?\u0027 said Harry, as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him. \u0027Well, wouldn\u0027t it have been easier if she\u0027d just asked me whether I liked her better than you?\u0027 \u0027Girls don\u0027t often ask questions like that,\u0027 said Hermione. \u0027Well, they should!\u0027 said Harry forcefully. \u0027Then I could\u0027ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn\u0027t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not saying what she did was sensible,\u0027 said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled. \u0027I\u0027m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time.\u0027 \u0027You should write a book,\u0027 Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, \u0027translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table. Cho had just got up, and, still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall. Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny. \u0027So, how was Quidditch practice?\u0027 \u0027It was a nightmare,\u0027 said Ron in a surly voice. \u0027Oh come on,\u0027 said Hermione, looking at Ginny, \u0027I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t that--\u0027 \u0027Yes, it was,\u0027 said Ginny. \u0027It was appalling. Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it.\u0027 Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a new star-chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up. \u0027Ron and Ginny not here?\u0027 asked Fred, looking around as he pulled up a chair, and when Harry shook his head, he said, \u0027Good. We were watching their practice. They\u0027re going to be slaughtered. They\u0027re complete rubbish without us.\u0027 \u0027Come on, Ginny\u0027s not bad,\u0027 said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. \u0027Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren\u0027t looking,\u0027 said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said George, looking mildly impressed. \u0027Well--that\u0027d explain it.\u0027 \u0027Has Ron saved a goal yet?\u0027 asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms. \u0027Well, he can do it if he doesn\u0027t think anyone\u0027s watching him,\u0027 said Fred, rolling his eyes. \u0027So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday.\u0027 He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds. \u0027You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for.\u0027 Hermione cast him a stern look. \u0027You\u0027ve got exams coming!\u0027 \u0027Told you already, we\u0027re not fussed about NEWTs,\u0027 said Fred. \u0027The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us on to it.\u0027 George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky. \u0027I dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself.\u0027 \u0027Kill him, more like,\u0027 said Fred firmly. \u0027That\u0027s the trouble with Quidditch,\u0027 said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her Runes translation, \u0027it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses.\u0027 She looked up to find her copy of Spellman\u0027s Syllabary, and caught Fred, George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces. \u0027Well, it does!\u0027 she said impatiently. \u0027It\u0027s only a game, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Hermione,\u0027 said Harry, shaking his head, \u0027you\u0027re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don\u0027t understand about Quidditch.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not,\u0027 she said darkly, returning to her translation, \u0027but at least my happiness doesn\u0027t depend on Ron\u0027s goalkeeping ability.\u0027 And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either. The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron\u0027s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby\u0027s nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty. \u0027Good catch,\u0027 Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. \u0027I was lucky,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027It wasn\u0027t a very fast Snitch and Summerby\u0027s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once you\u0027re back on the team--\u0027 \u0027Ginny, I\u0027ve got a lifelong ban.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,\u0027 Ginny corrected him. \u0027There\u0027s a difference. Anyway, once you\u0027re back, I think I\u0027ll, try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway\u0027 Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of Butlerbeer clutched in his hand. \u0027Angelina still won\u0027t let him resign,\u0027 Ginny said, as though reading Harry\u0027s mind. \u0027She says she knows he\u0027s got it in him.\u0027 Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of \u0027Weasley is our King\u0027 sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favourites to win the Quidditch Cup. Fred and George wandered over. \u0027I haven\u0027t even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,\u0027 said Fred, looking over at Ron\u0027s crumpled figure. \u0027Mind you ... when he missed the fourteenth--\u0027 He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle. \u0027--well, I\u0027ll save it for parties, eh?\u0027 Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible. Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite impressed by Ginny\u0027s performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner ... there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke\u0027s ankle; if Ginny hadn\u0027t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her wide toad\u0027s mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson. He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron\u0027s snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down. He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the DA. But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door. He walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it ... he was feet from it, and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side ... the door was ajar ... he stretched out his hand to push it wide and-- Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen the door, but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron ... if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute. They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught. She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire year, he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake. \u0027Who\u0027re you after?\u0027 he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the recipient\u0027s name and address: Harry Potter Great Hall Hogwarts School Frowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first. \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting and flapping their wings. \u0027Harry!\u0027 said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. \u0027I think I know what this means--open this one first!\u0027 Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition of The Quibbler.He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across this picture were the words: HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN \u0027It\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron. \u0027It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,\u0027 she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, \u0027are letters from readers.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what I thought,\u0027 said Hermione eagerly. \u0027Harry, d\u0027you mind if we--?\u0027 \u0027Help yourself,\u0027 said Harry, feeling slightly bemused. Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes. \u0027This one\u0027s from a bloke who thinks you\u0027re off your rocker,\u0027 said Ron, glancing down his letter. \u0027Ah well ...\u0027 \u0027This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo\u0027s,\u0027 said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second. \u0027This one looks OK, though,\u0027 said Harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley. \u0027Hey she says she believes me!\u0027 \u0027This one\u0027s in two minds,\u0027 said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm. \u0027Says you don\u0027t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn\u0027t want to believe You-Know-Who\u0027s back so he doesn\u0027t know what to think now. Blimey, what a waste of parchment.\u0027 \u0027Here\u0027s another one you\u0027ve convinced, Harry!\u0027 said Hermione excitedly. \u0027Having read your side of the story, I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly ... little though I want to think that He Who Must Not Be Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth ...Oh, this is wonderful!\u0027 \u0027Another one who thinks you\u0027re barking,\u0027 said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder \u0027... but this one says you\u0027ve got her converted and she now thinks you\u0027re a real hero--she\u0027s put in a photograph, too--wow!\u0027 \u0027What is going on here?\u0027 said a falsely sweet, girlish voice. Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad\u0027s eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry. Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly. \u0027Why have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter?\u0027 she asked slowly. \u0027Is that a crime now?\u0027 said Fred loudly. \u0027Getting mail?\u0027 \u0027Be careful, Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention,\u0027 said Umbridge. \u0027Well, Mr Potter?\u0027 Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridge\u0027s attention. \u0027People have written to me because I gave an interview,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027About what happened to me last June.\u0027 For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick. \u0027An interview?\u0027 repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Here--\u0027 And he threw the copy of The Quibbler to her. She caught it and stared down at the cover. Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet. \u0027When did you do this?\u0027 she asked, her voice trembling slightly. \u0027Last Hogsmeade weekend,\u0027 said Harry. She looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers. \u0027There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027How you dare ... how you could ...\u0027 She took a deep breath. \u0027I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week\u0027s worth of detentions.\u0027 She stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of many students following her. By mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on house noticeboards, but in the corridors and classrooms too. BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibblerwill be expelled. The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven. Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure. \u0027What exactly are you so happy about?\u0027 Harry asked her. \u0027Oh, Harry, don\u0027t you see?\u0027 Hermione breathed. \u0027If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it!\u0027 And it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of the day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other. Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls\u0027 toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes. \u0027Then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they bombarded me with questions,\u0027 Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, \u0027and Harry, I think they believe you, I really do. I think you\u0027ve finally got them convinced!\u0027 Meanwhile, Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets: Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her. The pages carrying Harry\u0027s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it. The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms, said, \u0027Shh!\u0027 and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister for Magic and have twelve children. But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew what had happened, her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, \u0027I\u0027m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.\u0027 He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And unbelievably, no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him. \u0027I just wanted to say,\u0027 he mumbled, squinting at Harry\u0027s left knee, \u0027I believe you. And I\u0027ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.\u0027 If anything more was needed to complete Harry\u0027s happiness, it was the reaction he got from Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library; they were with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott. They looked round at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment. Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: he had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters. \u0027And the best bit,\u0027 whispered Hermione gleefully, as they left the library, \u0027is they can\u0027t contradict you, because they can\u0027t admit they\u0027ve read the article!\u0027 To cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no issue of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster. \u0027Dad\u0027s reprinting!\u0027 she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. \u0027He can\u0027t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!\u0027 Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night. Daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry\u0027s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like \u0027THE MINISTRY ARE MORONS\u0027 and \u0027EAT DUNG, UMBRIDGE\u0027 in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like \u0027DUNG\u0027 and \u0027UMBRIDGE\u0027 at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact, it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night. The dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick. He rolled over on to his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once ... He was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair. Beyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes. \u0027I have been badly advised, it seems,\u0027 said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger. \u0027Master, I crave your pardon,\u0027 croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling. \u0027I do not blame you, Rookwood,\u0027 said Harry in that cold, cruel voice. He relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering on the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual. \u0027You are sure of your facts, Rookwood?\u0027 asked Harry. \u0027Yes, My Lord, yes ... I used to work in the Department aftet--after all ...\u0027 \u0027Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.\u0027 \u0027Bode could never have taken it, Master ... Bode would have known he could not ... undoubtedly, that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy\u0027s Imperius Curse ...\u0027 \u0027Stand up, Rookwood,\u0027 whispered Harry. The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry\u0027s face. \u0027You have done well to tell me this,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Very well ... I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems ... but no matter ... we begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort\u0027s gratitude, Rookwood ...\u0027 \u0027My Lord ... yes, My Lord,\u0027 gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief. \u0027I shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.\u0027 \u0027Of course, My Lord, of course ... anything ...\u0027 \u0027Very well ... you may go. Send Avery to me.\u0027 Rookwood scurried backwards, bowing, and disappeared through a door. Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned towards the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved towards it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness ... a face whiter than a skull ... red eyes with slits for pupils ... \u0027NOOOOOOOOO!\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 yelled a voice nearby. Harry Hailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced he was about to see the white, skull-like lace looming at him out of the dark again, then very near to him Ron\u0027s voice spoke. \u0027Will you stop acting like a maniac so I can get you out of here!\u0027 Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes. \u0027Has someone been attacked again?\u0027 asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet. \u0027Is it Dad? Is it that snake?\u0027 \u0027No--everyone\u0027s fine--\u0027 gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it were on fire. \u0027Well ... Avery isn\u0027t ... he\u0027s in trouble ... he gave him the wrong information ... Voldemort\u0027s really angry ...\u0027 Harry groaned and sank, shaking, on to his bed, rubbing his scar. \u0027But Rookwood\u0027s going to help him now ... he\u0027s on the right track again ...\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 said Ron, sounding scared. \u0027D\u0027you mean ... did you just see You-Know-Who?\u0027 \u0027I was You-Know-Who,\u0027 said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face, to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. \u0027He was with Rookwood, he\u0027s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwood\u0027s just told him Bode couldn\u0027t have done it.\u0027 \u0027Done what?\u0027 \u0027Remove something ... he said Bode would have known he couldn\u0027t have done it ... Bode was under the Imperius Curse ... I think he said Malfoy\u0027s dad put it on him.\u0027 \u0027Bode was bewitched to remove something?\u0027 Ron said. \u0027But--Harry, that\u0027s got to be--\u0027 \u0027The weapon,\u0027 Harry finished the sentence for him. \u0027I know.\u0027 The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter. \u0027Did you say,\u0027 murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry\u0027s on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, \u0027that you were You-Know-Who?\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Harry quietly. Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water; Harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest. \u0027Harry,\u0027 he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes and talking, \u0027you\u0027ve got to tell--\u0027 \u0027I haven\u0027t got to tell anyone,\u0027 said Harry shortly. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I\u0027m supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. That\u0027s what they want.\u0027 By \u0027they\u0027 he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron\u0027s mattress creak as he, too, lay back down. Harry\u0027s scar began to burn; he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished. Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened; they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard. \u0027So that\u0027s why they killed him,\u0027 she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last. \u0027When Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people touching it. That\u0027s why he was in St. Mungos, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn\u0027t talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn\u0027t risk him getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he\u0027d got his voice back, he\u0027d explain what he\u0027d been doing, wouldn\u0027t he? They would have known he\u0027d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is he?\u0027 \u0027He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027In the--hang on ...\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if--\u0027 \u0027Sturgis!\u0027 gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck. \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said Ron, looking bewildered. \u0027Sturgis Podmore --\u0027 said Hermione breathlessly, \u0027arrested for trying to get through a door! Lucius Malfoy must have got him too! I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody\u0027s Invisibility Cloak, right? So, what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move--or guessed someone was there--or just did the Imperius Curse on the off-chance there\u0027d be a guard there? So, when Sturgis next had an opportunity--probably when it was his turn on guard duty again--he tried to get into the Department to steal the weapon for Voldemort--Ron, be quiet--but he got caught and sent to Azkaban ...\u0027 She gazed at Harry. \u0027And now Rookwood\u0027s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t hear all the conversation, but that\u0027s what it sounded like,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Rookwood used to work there ... maybe Voldemort\u0027ll send Rookwood to do it?\u0027 Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she said, \u0027But you shouldn\u0027t have seen this at all, Harry.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 he said, taken aback. \u0027You\u0027re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,\u0027 said Hermione, suddenly stern. \u0027I know I am,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But--\u0027 \u0027Well, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,\u0027 said Hermione firmly. \u0027And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.\u0027 Harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day, which proved to be another bad one. When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors, they were laughing at Gryffindor\u0027s abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff; the Slytherins were singing Weasley is our King\u0027 so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation. The week did not improve as it progressed. Harry received two more \u0027Ds in Potions; he was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack; and he couldn\u0027t stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been Voldemort--though he didn\u0027t bring it up with Ron and Hermione again; he didn\u0027t want another telling-off from Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind. Unfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been. \u0027Get up, Potter.\u0027 A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape\u0027s office, trying to clear his head. He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school. \u0027That last memory,\u0027 said Snape. \u0027What was it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. \u0027You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Snape softly. \u0027I mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room ...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s ... nothing,\u0027 said Harry. Snape\u0027s dark eyes bored into Harry\u0027s. Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away. \u0027How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?\u0027 said Snape. \u0027It--\u0027 said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, \u0027it was--just a dream I had.\u0027 \u0027A dream?\u0027 repeated Snape. There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid. \u0027You do know why we are here, don\u0027t you, Potter?\u0027 said Snape, in a low, dangerous voice. \u0027You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry stiffly. \u0027Remind me why we are here, Potter.\u0027 \u0027So I can learn Occlumency, said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel. \u0027Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be--\u0027 Harry looked back at Snape, hating him \u0027--I would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?\u0027 \u0027Just that one,\u0027 lied Harry. \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, \u0027perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special-- important?\u0027 \u0027No, they don\u0027t,\u0027 said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand. That is just as well, Potter,\u0027 said Snape coldly, \u0027because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.\u0027 \u0027No--that\u0027s your job, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Harry shot at him. He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on Snape\u0027s face when he answered. \u0027Yes, Potter,\u0027 he said, his eyes glinting. \u0027That is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again.\u0027 He raised his wand: \u0027One--two--three--Legilimens!\u0027 A hundred dementors were swooping towards Harry across the lake in the grounds ... he screwed up his face in concentration ... they were coming closer ... he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods ... yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him, his eyes fixed on Harry\u0027s face, muttering under his breath ... and somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter ... Harry raised his own wand. \u0027Protego!\u0027 Snape staggered-- his wand flew upwards, away from Harry--and suddenly Harry\u0027s mind was teeming with memories that were not his: a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner ... a greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies ... a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick-- \u0027ENOUGH!\u0027 Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he staggered several steps backwards, hit some of the shelves covering Snape\u0027s walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly, and was very white in the face. The back of Harry\u0027s robes was damp. One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion. \u0027Reparo,\u0027 hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself at once. \u0027Well, Potter ... that was certainly an improvement ...\u0027 Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though he was checking they were still there. \u0027I don\u0027t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm ... but there is no doubt that it was effective ...\u0027 Harry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape\u0027s memories, that he had just seen scenes from Snape\u0027s childhood. It was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes. \u0027Let\u0027s try again, shall we?\u0027 said Snape. Harry felt a thrill of dread; he was about to pay for what had just happened, he was sure of it. They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time. \u0027On the count of three, then,\u0027 said Snape, raising his wand once more. \u0027One--two--\u0027 Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before Snape cried, \u0027Legilimens!\u0027 He was hurtling along the corridor towards the Department of Masteries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches--the plain black door was growing ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it, he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light-- The door had flown open! He was through it at last, inside a black-walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and there were more doors all around him--he needed to go on--but which door ought he to take--? \u0027P OTTER!\u0027 Harry opened his eyes. He was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there; he was also panting as though his really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room. \u0027Explain yourself!\u0027 said Snape, who was standing over him, looking furious. \u0027I ... dunno what happened,\u0027 said Harry truthfully, standing up. There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen that before. I mean, I told you, I\u0027ve dreamed about the door ... but it\u0027s never opened before ...\u0027 \u0027You are not working hard enough!\u0027 For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen into his teacher\u0027s memories. \u0027You are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord--\u0027 \u0027Can you tell me something, sir?\u0027 said Harry, firing up again. \u0027Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord? I\u0027ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that.\u0027 Snape opened his mouth in a snarl--and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room. Snape\u0027s head jerked upwards; he was gazing at the ceiling. \u0027What the--?\u0027 he muttered. Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the Entrance Hall. Snape looked round at him, frowning. \u0027Did you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?\u0027 Harry shook his head. Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again. Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed. The screams were indeed coming from the Entrance Hall; they grew louder as Harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons. When he reached the top he found the Entrance Hall packed; students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in progress, to see what was going on; others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase. Harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry en the other side of the Hall; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick. Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the Entrance Hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside-down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her. Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs. \u0027No!\u0027 she shrieked. \u0027NO! This cannot be happening ... it cannot ... I retuse to accept it!\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t realise this was coming?\u0027 said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, saw that Trelawney\u0027s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge. \u0027Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather, you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable that you would be sacked?\u0027 \u0027You c--can\u0027t!\u0027 howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses, \u0027you c--can\u0027t sack me! I\u0027ve b--been here sixteen years! H-- Hogwarts is m--my h--home!\u0027 \u0027It was your home,\u0027 said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, on to one of her trunks, \u0027until an hour ago, when the Minister for Magic countersigned your Order of Dismissal. Now kindly remove yourself from this Hall. You are embarrassing us.\u0027 But she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both crying quietly, their arms round each other. Then he heard footsteps. Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes. \u0027There, there, Sybill ... calm down ... blow your nose on this ... it\u0027s not as bad as you think, now ... you are not going to have to leave Hogwarts ...\u0027 \u0027Oh really, Professor McGonagall?\u0027 said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward. \u0027And your authority for that statement is ... ?\u0027 \u0027That would be mine,\u0027 said a deep voice. The oaken front doors had swung open. Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards Professor Trelawney, tear-stained and trembling, on her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her. \u0027Yours, Professor Dumbledore?\u0027 said Umbridge, with a singularly unpleasant little laugh. \u0027I\u0027m afraid you do not understand the position. I have here--\u0027 she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes \u0027--an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister for Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon probation and sack any teacher she--that is to say, I--feel is not performing to the standards required by the Ministry of Magic. I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dismissed her.\u0027 To Harry\u0027s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, \u0027You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid,\u0027 he went on, with a courteous little bow, \u0027that the power to do that still resides with the Headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.\u0027 At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden. \u0027No--no, I\u0027ll g --go, Dumbledore! I sh--shall--leave Hogwarts and s--seek my fortune elsewhere--\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Dumbledore sharply. \u0027It is my wish that you remain, Sybill.\u0027 He turned to Professor McGonagall. \u0027Might I ask you to escort Sybill back upstairs, Professor McGonagall?\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 said McGonagall. \u0027Up you get, Sybill ...\u0027 Professor Sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney\u0027s other arm. Together, they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked \u0027Locomotor trunks!\u0027 and Professor Trelawney\u0027s luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear. Professor Umbridge was standing stock still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly. \u0027And what,\u0027 she said, in a whisper that carried all around the Eintrance Hall, \u0027are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?\u0027 \u0027Oh, that won\u0027t be a problem,\u0027 said Dumbledore pleasantly. \u0027You see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve found-- ?\u0027 said Umbridge shrilly. \u0027You\u0027ve found? Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Number Twenty-two--\u0027 \u0027The Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if--and only if--the Headmaster is unable to find one,\u0027 said Dumbledore. \u0027And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded. May I introduce you?\u0027 He turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur around the Hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer. Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes; the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse. \u0027This is Firenze,\u0027 said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge. \u0027I think you\u0027ll find him suitable.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5/page-26.html","bookId":2072,"book":{"id":2072,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter #5) Grade 4 Up-Harry has just returned to Hogwarts after a lonely summer. Dumbledore is uncommunicative and most of the students seem to think Harry is either conceited or crazy for insisting that Voldemort is back and as evil as ever. Angry, scared, and unable to confide in his godfather, Sirius, the teen wizard lashes out at his friends and enemies alike. The head of the Ministry of Magic is determined to discredit Dumbledore and undermine his leadership of Hogwarts, and he appoints nasty, pink-cardigan-clad Professor Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and High Inquisitor of the school, bringing misery upon staff and students alike. This bureaucratic nightmare, added to Harry\u0027s certain knowledge that Voldemort is becoming more powerful, creates a desperate, Kafkaesque feeling during Harry\u0027s fifth year at Hogwarts. The adults all seem evil, misguided, or simply powerless, so the students must take matters into their own hands. Harry\u0027s confusion about his godfather and father, and his apparent rejection by Dumbledore make him question his own motives and the condition of his soul. Also, Harry is now 15, and the hormones are beginning to kick in. There are a lot of secret doings, a little romance, and very little Quidditch or Hagrid (more reasons for Harry\u0027s gloom), but the power of this book comes from the young magician\u0027s struggles with his emotions and identity. Particularly moving is the unveiling, after a final devastating tragedy, of Dumbledore\u0027s very strong feelings of attachment and responsibility toward Harry. Children will enjoy the magic and the Hogwarts mystique, and young adult readers will find a rich and compelling coming-of-age story as well.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-potter-5.jpg","author":"J.K.
