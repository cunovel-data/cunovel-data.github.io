{"id":26000,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X A MISSION","content":"\"I WISH that we had trustworthy news of what Dost Mahomed is doing,\" Sir Alexander Burnes said one morning when he and his assistants were talking over the work for the day. \"Of course one hears from the Hindoo merchants what rumours are circulating, but these are so contradictory that they are not to be relied upon. One day it is said that Dost has retired to Bokhara, another that he has already gathered a formidable force. It is certain that if he does not recross the Bamian soon he will not give us any trouble till the spring, for I doubt whether even the Afghans, hardy as they are, could traverse the passes when winter has fairly set in. Still, it would be very useful to us to obtain some sort of inkling as to what his movements and intentions are. He may intend to make a bold stroke to recover his kingdom, he may wait until[Pg 162] there is a popular rising here. In the first case, our force here must be maintained at the present strength, and it would be well to warn Lord Auckland as soon as possible that next spring its strength must be increased rather than diminished. If, on the other hand, Dost depends upon a rising here rather than upon any force he may himself gather, there will be no occasion for more troops than we have, for these should suffice to crush any tribal rising.\" \"I should be happy to undertake the mission if you would confide it to me, sir,\" Angus said. \"I travelled as a Persian without exciting suspicion, and I can do the same again. I might obtain a couple of horse-loads of Indian silk and cashmere goods, and travel as a Persian trader who has been settled here, but who, fearing that fresh disturbances might occur, had decided to make a trip himself to Bokhara with a view of establishing himself there. I see all trade is at present at a stand-still, as the northern traders dare not venture down here. The fact that I can also speak Pushtoo will, of course, be an advantage, and would seem to show that I had, as I gave out, resided here for some time.\" \"It would be a dangerous enterprise, Mr. Campbell.\" \"There would be a certain amount of danger in it, sir, but not, it seems to me, excessive—not more than I met in my journey from Herat. There is danger, as you have frequently said, even here; and at any rate, I am ready to take all risks if you think that the mission would be of utility.\" \"That it would certainly be, and I admit that no one would be more likely to carry it to a successful conclusion, but I fear that it would be impossible for you to return before the spring.\" \"I do not think that I could return across the mountains, but I might dispose of my goods to the Turkomans.[Pg 163] From what we hear, Dost Mahomed is either at Balkh or Kunduz, or possibly Tashkurgan, half-way between them. Balkh would, of course, be more convenient, for it is but a couple of days\u0027 journey to Kilif, on the other side of the Oxus. There I might dispose of my goods, and buy carpets and shawls of Bokhara; and then travel across the plains to Herat; thence, by the trade route, to Candahar; and so back through Ghuznee. That would, of course, be a long journey, but there would be no very lofty passes to traverse. I need hardly say that I should not enter Herat, as I might be recognized there; but there would be no fear of recognition elsewhere. As my servant is really a Persian, and has also picked up Pushtoo, he would greatly aid me in preserving my disguise. At any rate, I would rather be doing something than remaining here idle through the winter.\" \"Then I accept your offer, Mr. Campbell. The information you would give as to the feeling of the people on the other side of the mountains would be invaluable. I will myself question one or two of the Hindoo merchants as to the goods that are generally sent to Bokhara. I know, of course, that the bulk of that trade with India is carried on through Candahar and Herat, but it would be natural that a trader residing here and wishing to leave should prefer the direct route, however toilsome it might be. I should say easy loads for three animals would be sufficient, and as the merchandise would be of light materials, a considerable value could be carried by three horses. You will need a fourth for a small stock of provisions, for you will have to depend on yourselves until you are on the other side of the passes. You will require two men to look after the four horses. I will obtain two soldiers from one of the Pathan regiments. It would be dangerous for you to hire a man in the city; I will get a couple of men of approved fidelity.[Pg 164] They will, of course, be in native dress, and will pass as peasants hired for the journey by you. Four of you, well armed, should be able to give a good account of yourselves if you should fall in with any small party of freebooters, though that is more likely to happen on your return journey than on your way across the hills.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Well, to-day is Monday; it will take two or three days to make all the preparations and get the sort of men you require. Would you be ready to start on Thursday?\" \"Certainly, sir. As far as I and my man are concerned, we should be ready to start at a moment\u0027s notice, as there will be no difficulty in buying the clothes we require.\" \"Very well, then, it shall be settled for Thursday. I know I need not tell you to warn your servant to maintain absolute secrecy as to the fact that you are leaving the town.\" Azim was greatly pleased when Angus told him of the intended expedition, for, having few duties to perform, he had found the time hang heavily on his hands, and was glad to hear that he was not to spend the long winter at Cabul. He purchased in the bazaars all the garments for his master and himself—high boots lined with fur, and cloaks of thick cloth similarly lined, and Afghan hats of black lamb\u0027s wool. rock THERE, LYING CLOSE UNDER A ROCK, WAS A YOUNG AFGHAN. On Wednesday evening Sir Alexander Burnes said to Angus: \"It is just as well that you did not make your start this morning, for there has been a sharp skirmish on the road ten miles off between a squadron of our cavalry and a party of Afghan horse. I hear the fellows fought well, but were driven off with considerable loss. I have seen the two men who have been selected to accompany you, they have both been some time in our service. Their colonel spoke highly to me of them. I explained to them the nature[Pg 165] of the duty on which they were going, and gave them the option of declining it, but said that if they carried it through successfully they would on their return receive a present of six months\u0027 pay and would at once be promoted. They accepted without hesitation, and I feel certain that you can rely upon them. They were recruited from the border tribes, which have ever held themselves independent of the Afghan factions, and have no sympathy whatever either with the Kuzzilbashes or Soojah himself, and care not a snap who rules over Afghanistan. If questioned, their story will be that they came up as camp followers with Colonel Wade\u0027s force, and that on arriving at Cabul their work with the army was at an end, and they took service with the Persian trader. All the goods and packs have been marked in Persian characters, with the prices they would fetch in Persia, and those at which they would probably sell at Bokhara; so that you will know how to carry on your trading without exciting suspicion either by asking too little or by demanding an unusual price. Each man will lead two horses, and I have provided rough ponies for them to ride. I think you will find that no detail has been neglected. I have had a thousand rupees sewn up in the saddle of your horse. I sent for one of the cavalry saddlers, and your man showed him which was your saddle. Another five hundred are sewn in the saddle of your servant in case of mishap. Here is a letter to Lieutenant Mackenzie, who commands the troop of horse artillery which is at Bamian with the Ameer\u0027s Ghoorka regiment. You may be questioned there, so without giving him any details I have simply requested him to allow the bearer and his party to pass on without question or interference.\" The start was not made from the house of Sir Alexander Burnes, but from that of the Hindoo merchant from whom goods had been purchased. As there was nothing unusual in[Pg 166] a trader starting with some horse-loads of merchandise, no attention was attracted, and the party crossed the plain four miles farther up, and skirted the foot of the mountains until they reached the gorge through which the track—for it could not be called a road—led over the mountains to Bamian. They had decided to camp here, but they found that it was the scene of the previous day\u0027s combat. Dead horses and men were scattered about, and it was evident that the Afghans had been lying in ambush here, aware that at times parties of our cavalry rode some distance up the pass. They determined to go half a mile farther up the gorge, as there was no danger of disturbance by the Afghans, who, after their defeat on the previous day, were not likely to be in the neighbourhood. After proceeding a quarter of a mile Angus, who was riding ahead, suddenly stopped his horse, hearing a deep groan. As the ground was strewn with rocks on either side of the track, he concluded at once that some poor fellow had crawled away to die, unnoticed by our cavalry returning from pursuit. Knowing what tortures he must be suffering from thirst he dismounted, and filling a pannikin from one of the skins, he bade Azim bring some fruit, and then made his way to the spot from which the sound proceeded. There, lying close under a rock, was a young Afghan, whose clothes showed that he was a chief of some rank. His eyes were closed, his face pallid and drawn, his lips black and cracked with thirst. Angus knelt beside him, and poured a few drops of water between his lips. This he repeated again and again. The wounded man opened his eyes with a deep exclamation of thankfulness. Then his face darkened, and he said: \"You meant kindly, good friend, but you have done me a cruel service. The worst had passed; I had sunk into un[Pg 167]consciousness, and should have passed into Paradise without more pain.\" \"Where are you wounded?\" Angus asked. \"Perhaps we can do something for you.\" The Afghan slightly shook his head. \"Nothing can be done for me,\" he said. \"I have a musket-ball in my shoulder, and my right leg is broken above the knee.\" \"At any rate we can make you comfortable. We were going to camp a short way ahead, but we will now do so here.\" \"May Allah bless you, but it would be better to leave me to die at once.\" \"That I cannot do. Now, have a good drink of water, and then I will cut a melon into pieces for you to suck while we are preparing our camp.\" The horses\u0027 loads were removed and the animals turned loose to graze on the grass growing among the rocks. Then the tent was erected and the Afghan carried into the shade of a high rock close by. By this time he was able to speak more strongly, and said: \"You are Persian, I see, by your dress. How comes it that you have entered this lonely gorge with your pack-horses and your goods?\" \"We are going to make our road to Bokhara. There are rumours of disaffection in Cabul, and if there is fighting the houses of the traders will be looted. Therefore I resolved to leave while I could, and am taking my Indian goods for sale there.\" \"It will be a terrible journey,\" the young chief said. \"There is already snow in the upper passes. I wish you success. I shall think of your kindness as I lie here, and pray Allah to protect you. Before you go I pray you to carry me down to the edge of this stream, so that I may drink when I will.\" [Pg 168] \"We will certainly do that, and give you a supply of fruit if we can do no better. Now we must look and see to your wounds. I can at least bandage them, and make you somewhat easier.\" To his surprise Angus found no wounds in the leg. \"I see no bullet mark,\" he said. \"No, the leg was broken in my fall. My men had fought well, but the Feringees were too strong for them, and we fled. I was riding in their rear, when a shot struck me in the shoulder. I fell from my horse, and when I found that my leg was broken I felt my end was at hand; but I heard no more shots nor any further sound of galloping horses, and I knew that by Allah\u0027s mercy they had ceased their pursuit. My horse had galloped on after the others, and my men might not notice that I had fallen until they had gone some distance, when they would probably conclude that I had been killed. I managed to crawl out of the road to the shelter of that rock where you found me, as the infidels might come up in the morning, and I would rather die quietly there than be shot down.\" \"They would not have injured you,\" Angus said. \"They kill many in battle, but it is a rule with them never to touch an injured man; and had they come along they would have taken you back to their camp and have done all they could for you.\" \"I have heard that they were strange in that respect; but I did not think of it—my only wish was to die quietly and alone. I tried several times to crawl to the stream, but the agony was so great that I could not do it.\" Angus while he was speaking was feeling the limb. \"The first thing to do,\" he said, \"is to bring the ends of the bone together; the operation will be painful, but it will greatly relieve your sufferings.\" [Pg 169] \"Do as you will, stranger; Allah has sent you to my side, and what you do must be right.\" \"In the first place, I must prepare some splints to keep it in its place.\" Leaving the Afghan, Angus searched among the bushes until he found a shrub which was thick enough for the purpose. He and Azim with their knives cut this down near the root, and then divided it into lengths, split each of these and smoothed the pieces until they were perfectly even. He then tore off several long strips of cloth to form bandages, and calling to the two men, he returned to the wounded Afghan. The patient was lifted into another position, where he could place his left foot against a rock. \"Now, chief,\" Angus said, \"you must with that leg prevent yourself from being pulled forward; my servant will hold you round the body, so as to aid you; the other two men will take hold of your right leg and pull it, while as soon as it is sufficiently stretched I shall press the broken ends into their position. I am afraid that the pain will be very severe, but you will be much easier afterwards. At present the ends of the bones are tearing your flesh.\" \"An Afghan can bear pain,\" the chief said quietly; \"do as you will.\" \"Now,\" Angus said to the soldiers, \"take a firm hold above the ankle, and draw as steadily and quietly as you can, but with all your strength.\" The resistance of the muscles was so great that it was only by exercising their utmost power that the men got them to yield. At last Angus felt the end of the bone on which he was pressing suddenly slip into its place. Then for the first time he looked round. No sound had escaped the Afghan\u0027s lips, but the agony had been so intense that he had fainted. [Pg 170] \"Now, give me a long bandage, Azim; you need not hold him any longer. Double up a cloak or something and lift him and put it under him, so that I can pass the bandage round and round.\" First a wad of thick material soaked in water was placed round the leg at the point of the fracture, and then bandage was added to bandage, until the limb down to the knee was surrounded by a casing half an inch thick; then the splints were applied, some reaching only down to the knee, others to the ankle. These were held in their place by the three assistants, while Angus again firmly bandaged them. The operation being completed, he dashed some water on the Afghan\u0027s face. The latter soon opened his eyes. \"It is all over, chief; the bones are in their place again, and if all goes well, in time the ends may knit firmly together.\" \"It is easier already,\" the chief said gratefully. \"I no longer feel as if an evil spirit from Eblis were torturing me with a hot iron.\" \"I will now see to your shoulder. The wound has ceased bleeding; therefore I shall but sponge it with cold water and put a bandage on in case it should break out afresh.\" This was soon done. Some cloths soaked in water were laid over the bandage, then some more fruit was given to the wounded man, and he was left in the shade, and the men set about cooking a meal. Angus from time to time went across to see him, and had the satisfaction in the evening of finding that he had fallen asleep. \"Now, Azim,\" he said when he returned, \"the next thing to do is to settle what is to be done with him.\" \"I have been wondering that ever since we found him, master.\" \"There is a choice of two things: one is that I mount my horse, ride back to Cabul, report having found a wounded man, and ask that a party with a stretcher may be sent[Pg 171] out to fetch him in early in the morning; the other is to take him on with us.\" Azim looked in surprise. \"That would be very difficult, master.\" \"No doubt it would be difficult, but I think it might be done. There is no doubt that from his dress and appearance, and from the fact that he speaks excellent Persian, he is a chief of considerable standing. In that case his friendship might be invaluable to us, both on our way down to the frontier, and possibly in the future, which Sir Alexander Burnes regards as very threatening. It would be worth while, therefore, to make some sacrifice to carry him down to his friends. I would not do it if I thought the journey would harm him, but I believe the cold air of the mountains would be vastly better for him than the heat of the plains round Cabul. He may suffer somewhat from jolting, but I think that we can obviate that if we cut two strong poles about fifteen feet long, attach them to the pack-saddles of two horses, and by securely fastening a blanket between them make a hammock, in which he can ride comfortably. The poles would be elastic enough to save sudden jolts; we can only go at a foot\u0027s pace in these passes, and these native horses are so sure-footed that I think the chance of any accident is extremely slight. The horses are but lightly weighted, and as the provisions are consumed we can move a portion of the weight they carry to the one who takes our food.\" \"Yes, that would be a good plan, master.\" \"Another advantage of it would be,\" Angus went on, \"that whereas he would chafe at being in a hospital in care of the people he hates, his spirits would naturally rise as he felt that he was returning to his friends, and this would hasten his recovery. However, I will put the question to him in the morning. If he decides upon being kept in camp,[Pg 172] I will send you back with a letter to Sir Alexander Burnes for stretcher-bearers, and you will easily overtake us at our camping-place to-morrow evening.\" In the morning the young chief was better than Angus had even hoped for. Once or twice during the night fresh water had been poured gently over the bandages on the wounded shoulder. Like all people living chiefly in the open air, accustomed to climbing, and to hard exercise, the Afghans suffer less from wounds than Europeans do. Abstemious in their habits, comparatively small meat-eaters, lithe and sinewy in their figures, they speedily recover from wounds unless of a mortal nature. Angus found that the chief\u0027s forehead and hands were cool, and there were no signs of fever setting in. \"I have been thinking over what would be best for you, and decided to leave the choice to yourself. I am acquainted with Burnes Sahib, and if I send my servant with a letter I know that he will at once send out a party to carry you into hospital, where you will be well cared for.\" \"I would rather die than accept kindness at their hands,\" the Afghan said firmly. \"In that case there seems no other course but for me to construct a litter between two of my pack-horses, and to carry you over the mountains to Kundur.\" \"And would you thus burden yourself with a stranger?\" the Afghan asked in a tone of great surprise. \"Certainly I would for a wounded stranger,\" Angus said; \"but I do not think that there will be any great trouble, and I will try to make the journey as easy for you as possible.\" He then explained how he intended to carry him. The face of the wounded man lit up. He had permitted Angus to set his limb because he believed it was destiny that had sent him to his aid. He felt sure that the man who had taken such trouble with him would leave a store of[Pg 173] provisions within his reach, and that possibly some of the natives might come along and carry him to their village, and so tend him until his strength was restored. It was but a faint hope, for now that winter was approaching the men from the upper villages would have come down into the plain, and the chances were but slight that any would enter the gorge. His hope rested chiefly in the belief that, as he had been so unexpectedly saved from death, his final deliverance would also be effected; but that this kind trader should offer to carry him up the passes had never entered his mind, and his pale cheek flushed with pleasure. \"Certainly I will go with you if you will take me,\" he said joyfully; \"nobly indeed do you carry out the precept of the Prophet, to be compassionate to all those who need it.\" \"Let us say no more about it, chief. It will be a pleasure to me to see you grow stronger, and I doubt not that the mountain air will benefit you greatly, and I shall have my reward in seeing you regaining your strength. We have meat with us, but it will be better for you to take fruit and a little bread.\" Two soldiers were sent out, and presently returned with poles of the desired length and thickness. Breakfast was then eaten. Afterwards the poles, a long blanket having been firmly lashed between them, were securely fastened against the horses\u0027 flanks under their burdens. In this way a hammock was formed in which, while the body and legs were below the level of the poles, the head was somewhat above them. A cloak was rolled up to make a pillow, and the chief was then gently lifted and laid in it. They started at daybreak, rested in the shade for three or four hours in the middle of the day, and then continued their journey till late in the evening. After two days\u0027 travel the halt was no longer necessary, for they were now far[Pg 174] above the level of the plain. The air was fresh during the day, and at night all were glad to cover themselves with their long coats lined with sheep-skin. Angus had made no attempt to discover the position of the ball in the shoulder of the wounded chief. Even if he found it, he had neither the instruments nor the skill necessary for its removal. The only thing he could do was to keep the cloths bathed with cold water to prevent inflammation setting in. The track they were following sometimes disappeared altogether, and Angus often congratulated himself upon having the young chief with him, for the latter had twice before crossed the mountains, and was able to tell him which line to take. The day\u0027s journey varied much in length, being from fifteen to twenty-five miles, according as they found a suitable halting-place. They always camped where there was water, emptying the skins and filling them afresh as often as possible. At times the ground was covered with snow. This they thawed in a pot over a fire of brushwood, of which they were careful to gather some at every opportunity on the day\u0027s march. The chief and Angus occupied the little tent, while Azim slept with the two soldiers in a shelter composed of blankets. Every day there was a visible improvement in the state of the wounded man; the cool air acted as a tonic to his system. The first two or three days his arm pained him a good deal, though he had never once complained of it. It was kept bound to his side, and by means of splints and bandages the shoulder was held in its natural position; more than this Angus had not attempted. He believed that the shoulder was broken, but even of this he was not sure, and could only hope that the bone would knit together itself. One day, however, in reply to his questions the Afghan admitted that he felt a burning pain just over the left shoulder,[Pg 175] and feeling, Angus perceived a hard substance apparently but a short distance under the skin. \"There is no doubt that this is the ball,\" he said. \"A surgeon would cut down upon it, and get it out easily enough.\" \"Then why do you not do it? you seem very skilful.\" \"I have had no practice,\" he said. \"My father was a trader of Tabriz. He was a good man and very much respected. The poor often came to him in cases of accidents, and I have many a time seen him bandage broken limbs, that is why I was able to do it; but of bullet wounds I know nothing.\" \"Take my dagger and cut down to it at once; the pain of a cut is nothing. Cut fearlessly and deeply, so that you can take hold of the ball with your fingers.\" After some hesitation Angus agreed to do so, for, by the pain it was causing, the bullet might set up inflammation. \"It is a mere nothing,\" the Afghan said. \"I have frequently cut out bullets from my tribesmen.\" The chief\u0027s dagger was as keen as a razor, and seeing that his patient really wished it, Angus performed the operation. He had to cut three times before he could manage to get hold of the bullet. The Afghan himself did not once flinch. \"That is well,\" he said, when the ball was extracted. \"Now, bring the edges together again, put a piece of wet rag over them, and then tie a bandage tightly round me; by the end of a week there will be nothing but a scar remaining.\" Two days later they arrived at Bamian. As they entered the little town a native officer of a Ghoorka regiment came out and demanded their business. For the first time Angus was unable to give an answer in the language in which he was addressed. Knowing, however, the purport of the[Pg 176] question, he showed his letter to Lieutenant Mackenzie. The native was unable to read English, but called to an English artilleryman, who at once came up. On seeing the letter he motioned to the pretended trader to follow him, and conducted him to the house where Lieutenant Mackenzie lodged. \"There is a man outside who has a letter for you, sir,\" he said saluting. \"An Englishman?\" \"No, sir, one of these traders, I think. He has some horses with packs, and he has a wounded or dead man in a litter.\" \"Show him in.\" Angus on entering said in Persian, \"My orders are to deliver this letter to you when alone, sir.\" The lieutenant signed to two orderlies, to whom he had at the time been giving orders, and Angus then went on in English: \"You do not remember me, Lieutenant Mackenzie. I am Angus Campbell, on the staff of Sir Alexander Burnes.\" \"Oh, yes, I remember you now,\" the officer said, rising and shaking him by the hand. \"Of course we have met many times, but in that Persian dress I did not know you again. I suppose you have come to see how we are getting on?\" \"No. I am on a mission across the mountains to see what Dost Mahomed is really doing there, as you will see by this letter.\" The officer glanced through it. \"I see you do not want the natives here—there are not many of them—to be asking any questions. Let me see. We are pretty closely packed, as you may imagine. I could give you a room here, but that would hardly do.\" \"No, it would not do at all,\" Angus said. \"It would appear strange indeed to the natives if you were to so[Pg 177] honour a travelling merchant. I can do very well without a room, for I have a tent that I have used on my journey. All I wish is that you give an order that we shall not be in any way interfered with.\" \"That I can do easily enough, and will put a sentry over your encampment with orders that no one is to enter into conversation with your followers.\" \"Thank you; that is just what I desire.\" \"I hear that one of your men is ill, can anything be done for him? We have a doctor with us, and you could leave the man in hospital, and he could either make his way back when cured, or follow you—though I doubt whether that would be possible, as the passes will soon be completely blocked with snow. As soon as we are sure of this we shall return to Cabul, so we are looking forward eagerly, as you may imagine, for the news that they have become impassable.\" \"Thank you. The man met with an accident by falling from his horse, but I doctored him as well as I could, and I think in another day or two he will be able to sit a horse; and as he knows the passes, I must keep him with me, for already the paths are in many cases obliterated by snow, and I should fare badly indeed without him.\" \"Yes, I see that. How long are you going to stay here?\" \"I shall start again the day after to-morrow. It is most important that I should push on, for the passes may be closed any day. I will give the horses and men one day\u0027s rest, that is all that I can afford now. I will say good-bye, for it would not do for you to be seen speaking to me again.\" \"No, I suppose it would not do for you to come here, but I will after dark to-night come down and have a chat with you. I have had no news from Cabul for the last fortnight. There would be no harm in that, would there?\" [Pg 178] \"No; I should be very glad if you would come in that way.\" Half an hour later the tents were erected, and two sentries were placed near them to warn off all intruders. Angus went into the little town, and made some purchases from three small traders who had remained there, and had been well rewarded for doing so by the prices they obtained from the troops for their stores. Lieutenant Mackenzie, on his arrival, had ordered them to send all the liquor they had to his quarters, telling them that unless they agreed to this they would not be allowed to remain, and promising that the liquor should be returned to them when the troops left. Their stores were almost exhausted, but Angus was able to purchase some rice, a pot of ghee, and a sack of grain for the horses. At eight o\u0027clock Mackenzie came down. Sadut Khan had been apprised of the intended visit, and had willingly consented to be carried for the time into the other tent, so that Angus had his to himself. \"It is a snug little tent,\" Mackenzie said when he entered it; \"not much head room, but that is of no consequence, as it is only a place for sleeping in. I am ashamed to come empty-handed, but I only brought a couple of bottles of spirits with me, and they are both empty long ago. I can\u0027t drink this beastly native stuff. And besides, the room in which I stored all there was in the place when I got here is locked up. I made the traders put their seals to it so that there could be no dispute about the quantities when I handed them over.\" \"Thank you,\" Angus said; \"I don\u0027t touch spirits. Whatever may be the case in other places, I am convinced that men are better off without them in a country like this. Certainly they are best avoided in hot weather; and I think even in the cold weather coffee is infinitely better, and I have brought a good store of that with me. Now, make[Pg 179] yourself as comfortable as you can. Fill your pipe from that jar, it is the best Persian tobacco. Then when the coffee comes in I will give you the news from Cabul.\" A large jug of coffee, with two silver horns which Angus had bought before starting, was soon brought in, and then Angus told what had happened at Cabul since the last letter Mackenzie had received. \"Then you don\u0027t think things are going on well?\" Mackenzie said when he had concluded. \"No, there is much disaffection among the lower class in the city. The tribesmen are restless and discontented. It was a great mistake to allow Shah Soojah the entire control of all civilian matters; the consequence is that the people are grievously oppressed by the tax-gatherers. The Ameer himself is impatient at the slightest attempt to control him. He renders himself intensely unpopular by hardly ever appearing in public, by his refusal to grant audiences, and by his haughtiness and arrogance to those whom he does admit to his presence. I am certain that he could not maintain himself for a day if we were to march away, and I don\u0027t see how we can leave him to his fate. Altogether the situation is very difficult, and I am afraid it will end badly. They want a strong man at the head of affairs. I do not think that Macnaghten is a strong man. Keane is a good soldier, but it is said that he will return to England in the spring.\" \"And how about Burnes?\" \"Burnes is my chief,\" Angus said with a smile; \"but I can say this, I believe that if he were in Macnaghten\u0027s place things would go on better. At present, however, he has no authority of any kind. He differs from Macnaghten on almost every point, and any advice he gives is almost contemptuously neglected.\" \"It is a queer state of affairs,\" Mackenzie said. \"How[Pg 180]ever, I suppose we shall get out all right in the end. It is a way we have. We generally make a muddle in the beginning, but our fighting power has pulled us through. Well, I will be going now; it is eleven o\u0027clock. I think that it would be better that I should not come again to-morrow.\" \"I think so too. If the Afghans here entertained the smallest suspicion that you were visiting me, they would feel sure that I was not the trader I pretended to be, and would find means of sending a message across the mountains, which would result in the failure of my mission and my own certain death.\" After a hearty farewell, and an expression of the best wishes for the success of his mission, Mackenzie said good-bye and left the tent.
