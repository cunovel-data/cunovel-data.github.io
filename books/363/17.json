Anderton immediately approached the blond-haired young man.\n \"You\u0027ve got what you wanted,\" he told him. \"You can lock me up, and send me to the detention camp. But that won\u0027t be enough.\"\n Witwer\u0027s blue eyes were pale with uncertainty. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t understand—\"\n \"It\u0027s not my fault. I should never have left the police building. Where\u0027s Wally Page?\"\n \"We\u0027ve already clamped down on him,\" Witwer replied. \"He won\u0027t give us any trouble.\"\n Anderton\u0027s face was grim.\n \"You\u0027re holding him for the wrong reason,\" he said. \"Letting me into the monkey block was no crime. But passing information to Army is. You\u0027ve had an Army plant working here.\" He corrected himself, a little lamely, \"I mean, I have.\"\n \"I\u0027ve called back the order on you. Now the teams are looking for Kaplan.\"\n \"Any luck?\"\n \"He left here in an Army truck. We followed him, but the truck got into a militarized Barracks. Now they\u0027ve got a big wartime R-3 tank blocking the street. It would be civil war to move it aside.\"\n Slowly, hesitantly, Lisa made her way from the ship. She was still pale and shaken and on her throat an ugly bruise was forming.\n \"What happened to you?\" Witwer demanded. Then he caught sight of Fleming\u0027s inert form lying spread out inside. Facing Anderton squarely, he said: \"Then you\u0027ve finally stopped pretending this is some conspiracy of mine.\"\n \"I have.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m—\" He made a disgusted face. \"Plotting to get your job.\"\n \"Sure you are. Everybody is guilty of that sort of thing. And I\u0027m plotting to keep it. But this is something else—and you\u0027re not responsible.\"\n \"Why do you assert,\" Witwer inquired, \"that it\u0027s too late to turn yourself in? My God, we\u0027ll put you in the camp. The week will pass and Kaplan will still be alive.\"\n \"He\u0027ll be alive, yes,\" Anderton conceded. \"But he can prove he\u0027d be just as alive if I were walking the streets. He has the information that proves the majority report obsolete. He can break the Precrime system.\" He finished, \"Heads or tails, he wins—and we lose. The Army discredits us; their strategy paid off.\"\n \"But why are they risking so much? What exactly do they want?\"\n \"After the Anglo-Chinese War, the Army lost out. It isn\u0027t what it was in the good old AFWA days. They ran the complete show, both military and domestic. And they did their own police work.\"\n \"Like Fleming,\" Lisa said faintly.\n \"After the war, the Westbloc was demilitarized. Officers like Kaplan were retired and discarded. Nobody likes that.\" Anderton grimaced. \"I can sympathize with him. He\u0027s not the only one. But we couldn\u0027t keep on running things that way. We had to divide up the authority.\"\n \"You say Kaplan has won,\" Witwer said. \"Isn\u0027t there anything we can do?\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to kill him. We know it and he knows it. Probably he\u0027ll come around and offer us some kind of deal. We\u0027ll continue to function, but the Senate will abolish our real pull. You wouldn\u0027t like that, would you?\"\n \"I should say not,\" Witwer answered emphatically. \"One of these days I\u0027m going to be running this agency.\" He flushed. \"Not immediately, of course.\"\n Anderton\u0027s expression was somber. \"It\u0027s too bad you publicized the majority report. If you had kept it quiet, we could cautiously draw it back in. But everybody\u0027s heard about it. We can\u0027t retract it now.\"\n \"I guess not,\" Witwer admitted awkwardly. \"Maybe I—don\u0027t have this job down as neatly as I imagined.\"\n \"You will, in time. You\u0027ll be a good police officer. You believe in the status quo. But learn to take it easy.\" Anderton moved away from them. \"I\u0027m going to study the data tapes of the majority report. I want to find out exactly how I was supposed to kill Kaplan.\" Reflectively, he finished: \"It might give me some ideas.\"\n The data tapes of the precogs \"Donna\" and \"Mike\" were separately stored. Choosing the machinery responsible for the analysis of \"Donna,\" he opened the protective shield and laid out the contents. As before, the code informed him which reels were relevant and in a moment he had the tape-transport mechanism in operation.\n It was approximately what he had suspected. This was the material utilized by \"Jerry\"—the superseded time-path. In it Kaplan\u0027s Military Intelligence agents kidnapped Anderton as he drove home from work. Taken to Kaplan\u0027s villa, the organization GHQ of the International Veterans\u0027 League. Anderton was given an ultimatum: voluntarily disband the Precrime system or face open hostilities with Army.\n In this discarded time-path, Anderton, as Police Commissioner, had turned to the Senate for support. No support was forthcoming. To avoid civil war, the Senate had ratified the dismemberment of the police system, and decreed a return to military law \"to cope with the emergency.\" Taking a corps of fanatic police, Anderton had located Kaplan and shot him, along with other officials of the Veterans\u0027 League. Only Kaplan had died. The others had been patched up. And the coup had been successful.\n This was \"Donna.\" He rewound the tape and turned to the material previewed by \"Mike.\" It would be identical; both precogs had combined to present a unified picture. \"Mike\" began as \"Donna\" had begun: Anderton had become aware of Kaplan\u0027s plot against the police. But something was wrong. Puzzled, he ran the tape back to the beginning. Incomprehensibly, it didn\u0027t jibe. Again he relayed the tape, listening intently.\n The \"Mike\" report was quite different from the \"Donna\" report. An hour later, he had finished his examination, put away the tapes, and left the monkey block. As soon as he emerged, Witwer asked. \"What\u0027s the matter? I can see something\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"No,\" Anderton answered slowly, still deep in thought. \"Not exactly wrong.\" A sound came to his ears. He walked vaguely over to the window and\n peered out.\n The street was crammed with people. Moving down the center lane was a four-column line of uniformed troops. Rifles, helmets ... marching soldiers in their dingy wartime uniforms, carrying the cherished pennants of AFWA flapping in the cold afternoon wind.\n \"An Army rally,\" Witwer explained bleakly. \"I was wrong. They\u0027re not going to make a deal with us. Why should they? Kaplan\u0027s going to make it public.\"\n Anderton felt no surprise. \"He\u0027s going to read the minority report?\"\n \"Apparently. They\u0027re going to demand the Senate disband us, and take away our authority. They\u0027re going to claim we\u0027ve been arresting innocent men—nocturnal police raids, that sort of thing. Rule by terror.\"\n \"You suppose the Senate will yield?\"\n Witwer hesitated. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to guess.\"\n \"I\u0027ll guess,\" Anderton said. \"They will. That business out there fits with what I learned downstairs. We\u0027ve got ourselves boxed in and there\u0027s only one direction we can go. Whether we like it or not, we\u0027ll have to take it.\" His eyes had a steely glint.\n Apprehensively, Witwer asked: \"What is it?\"\n \"Once I say it, you\u0027ll wonder why you didn\u0027t invent it. Very obviously, I\u0027m going to have to fulfill the publicized report. I\u0027m going to have to kill Kaplan. That\u0027s the only way we can keep them from discrediting us.\"\n \"But,\" Witwer said, astonished, \"the majority report has been superseded.\"\n \"I can do it,\" Anderton informed him, \"but it\u0027s going to cost. You\u0027re familiar with the statutes governing first-degree murder?\"\n \"Life imprisonment.\"\n \"At least. Probably, you could pull a few wires and get it commuted to exile. I could be sent to one of the colony planets, the good old frontier.\"\n \"Would you—prefer that?\"\n \"Hell, no,\" Anderton said heartily. \"But it would be the lesser of the two evils. And it\u0027s got to be done.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see how you can kill Kaplan.\"\n Anderton got out the heavy-duty military weapon Fleming had tossed to him. \"I\u0027ll use this.\"\n \"They won\u0027t stop you?\"\n \"Why should they? They\u0027ve got that minority report that says I\u0027ve changed my mind.\"\n \"Then the minority report is incorrect?\"\n \"No,\" Anderton said, \"it\u0027s absolutely correct. But I\u0027m going to murder Kaplan anyhow.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/7413.html","bookId":363,"book":{"id":363,"title":"少数派报告 The Minority Report","description":"简介： The Minority Report is a 1956 science fiction short story by Philip K.
