{"id":35491,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Between noon and one o\u0027clock the rubbish-littered streets swarmed with people. He chose that time, the busiest part of the day, to make his call. Selecting a phonebooth in a patron-teeming super drugstore, he dialed the familiar police number and stood holding the cold receiver to his ear. Deliberately, he had selected the aud, not the vid line: in spite of his second-hand clothing and seedy, unshaven appearance, he might be recognized. The receptionist was new to him. Cautiously, he gave Page\u0027s extension. If Witwer were removing the regular staff and putting in his satellites, he might find himself talking to a total stranger. \"Hello,\" Page\u0027s gruff voice came. Relieved, Anderton glanced around. Nobody was paying any attention to him. The shoppers wandered among the merchandise, going about their daily routines. \"Can you talk?\" he asked. \"Or are you tied up?\" There was a moment of silence. He could picture Page\u0027s mild face torn with uncertainty as he wildly tried to decide what to do. At last came halting words. \"Why—are you calling here?\" Ignoring the question, Anderton said, \"I didn\u0027t recognize the receptionist. New personnel?\" \"Brand-new,\" Page agreed, in a thin, strangled voice. \"Big turnovers, these days.\" \"So I hear.\" Tensely, Anderton asked, \"How\u0027s your job? Still safe?\" \"Wait a minute.\" The receiver was put down and the muffled sound of steps came in Anderton\u0027s ear. It was followed by the quick slam of a door being hastily shut. Page returned. \"We can talk better now,\" he said hoarsely. \"How much better?\" \"Not a great deal. Where are you?\" \"Strolling through Central Park,\" Anderton said. \"Enjoying the sunlight.\" For all he knew, Page had gone to make sure the line-tap was in place. Right now, an airborne police team was probably on its way. But he had to take the chance. \"I\u0027m in a new field,\" he said curtly. \"I\u0027m an electrician these days.\" \"Oh?\" Page said, baffled. \"I thought maybe you had some work for me. If it can be arranged, I\u0027d like to drop by and examine your basic computing equipment. Especially the data and analytical banks in the monkey block.\" After a pause, Page said: \"It—might be arranged. If it\u0027s really important.\" \"It is,\" Anderton assured him. \"When would be best for you?\" \"Well,\" Page said, struggling. \"I\u0027m having a repair team come in to look at the intercom equipment. The acting-Commissioner wants it improved, so he can operate quicker. You might trail along.\" \"I\u0027ll do that. About when?\" \"Say four o\u0027clock. Entrance B, level 6. I\u0027ll meet you.\" \"Fine,\" Anderton agreed, already starting to hang up. \"I hope you\u0027re still in charge, when I get there.\" He hung up and rapidly left the booth. A moment later he was pushing through the dense pack of people crammed into the nearby cafeteria. Nobody would locate him there. He had three and a half hours to wait. And it was going to seem a lot longer. It proved to be the longest wait of his life before he finally met Page as arranged. The first thing Page said was: \"You\u0027re out of your mind. Why in hell did you come back?\" \"I\u0027m not back for long.\" Tautly, Anderton prowled around the monkey block, systematically locking one door after another. \"Don\u0027t let anybody in. I can\u0027t take chances.\" \"You should have quit when you were ahead.\" In an agony of apprehension, Page followed after him. \"Witwer is making hay, hand over fist. He\u0027s got the whole country screaming for your blood.\" Ignoring him, Anderton snapped open the main control bank of the analytical machinery. \"Which of the three monkeys gave the minority report?\" \"Don\u0027t question me—I\u0027m getting out.\" On his way to the door Page halted briefly, pointed to the middle figure, and then disappeared. The door closed; Anderton was alone. The middle one. He knew that one well. The dwarfed, hunched-over figure had sat buried in its wiring and relays for fifteen years. As Anderton approached, it didn\u0027t look up. With eyes glazed and blank, it contemplated a world that did not yet exist, blind to the physical reality that lay around it. \"Jerry\" was twenty-four years old. Originally, he had been classified as a hydrocephalic idiot but when he reached the age of six the psych testers had identified the precog talent, buried under the layers of tissue corrosion. Placed in a government-operated training school, the latent talent had been cultivated. By the time he was nine the talent had advanced to a useful stage. \"Jerry,\" however, remained in the aimless chaos of idiocy; the burgeoning faculty had absorbed the totality of his personality. Squatting down, Anderton began disassembling the protective shields that guarded the tape-reels stored in the analytical machinery. Using schematics, he traced the leads back from the final stages of the integrated computers, to the point where \"Jerry\u0027s\" individual equipment branched off. Within minutes he was shakily lifting out two half-hour tapes: recent rejected data not fused with majority reports. Consulting the code chart, he selected the section of tape which referred to his particular card. A tape scanner was mounted nearby. Holding his breath, he inserted the tape, activated the transport, and listened. It took only a second. From the first statement of the report it was clear what had happened. He had what he wanted; he could stop looking. \"Jerry\u0027s\" vision was misphased. Because of the erratic nature of precog-nition, he was examining a time-area slightly different from that of his companions. For him, the report that Anderton would commit a murder was an event to be integrated along with everything else. That assertion—and Anderton\u0027s reaction—was one more piece of datum. Obviously, \"Jerry\u0027s\" report superseded the majority report. Having been informed that he would commit a murder, Anderton would change his mind and not do so. The preview of the murder had cancelled out the murder; prophylaxis had occurred simply in his being informed. Already, a new time-path had been created. But \"Jerry\" was outvoted. Trembling, Anderton rewound the tape and clicked on the recording head. At high speed he made a copy of the report, restored the original, and removed the duplicate from the transport. Here was the proof that the card was invalid: obsolete. All he had to do was show it to Witwer.... His own stupidity amazed him. Undoubtedly, Witwer had seen the report; and in spite of it, had assumed the job of Commissioner, had kept the police teams out. Witwer didn\u0027t intend to back down; he wasn\u0027t concerned with Anderton\u0027s innocence. What, then, could he do? Who else would be interested? \"You damn fool!\" a voice behind him grated, wild with anxiety. Quickly, he turned. His wife stood at one of the doors, in her police uniform, her eyes frantic with dismay. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he told her briefly, displaying the reel of tape. \"I\u0027m leaving.\" Her face distorted, Lisa rushed frantically up to him. \"Page said you were here, but I couldn\u0027t believe it. He shouldn\u0027t have let you in. He just doesn\u0027t understand what you are.\" \"What am I?\" Anderton inquired caustically. \"Before you answer, maybe you better listen to this tape.\" \"I don\u0027t want to listen to it! I just want you to get out of here! Ed Witwer knows somebody\u0027s down here. Page is trying to keep him occupied, but—\" She broke off, her head turned stiffly to one side. \"He\u0027s here now! He\u0027s going to force his way in.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got any influence? Be gracious and charming. He\u0027ll probably forget about me.\" Lisa looked at him in bitter reproach. \"There\u0027s a ship parked on the roof. If you want to get away....\" Her voice choked and for an instant she was silent. Then she said, \"I\u0027ll be taking off in a minute or so. If you want to come—\" \"I\u0027ll come,\" Anderton said. He had no other choice. He had secured his tape, his proof, but he hadn\u0027t worked out any method of leaving. Gladly, he hurried after the slim figure of his wife as she strode from the block, through a side door and down a supply corridor, her heels clicking loudly in the deserted gloom. \"It\u0027s a good fast ship,\" she told him over her shoulder. \"It\u0027s emergency-fueled—ready to go. I was going to supervise some of the teams.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/7411.html","bookId":363,"book":{"id":363,"title":"少数派报告 The Minority Report","description":"简介： The Minority Report is a 1956 science fiction short story by Philip K.
