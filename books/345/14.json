{"id":9743,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. — ELECTION OF A NEW CAPTAIN.","content":"The excitement among the bushrangers was intense. Simultaneously they started forward, and two of them, bending over, lifted the body of their prostrate leader. But he was already dead. The bullet had reached his heart, and probably he never knew what hurt him. Robert Graham, the man who had caused his death, stood erect and unflinching. He threw his weapon upon the ground, folded his arms, and said, in a tone devoid of fear: \"Comrades, do with me what you will. I could not help doing what I did. It was either my brother\u0027s life or his. Sandy was innocent of the crime charged against him. He had no thought of treachery, though he did mean to leave your ranks. Is there anyone among you that would stand by and see his brother murdered before his eyes when he had the means of preventing it?\" The bushrangers looked at each other in doubt. They had at first accepted the captain\u0027s statement that Sandy Graham was a traitor. His brother\u0027s explanation of his attempted desertion put a new face on the matter. Then, again, there was not one among them that had not tired of their despotic leader. Alive, he had impressed them with fear, and held them in strict subordination, but he was far from popular, and had no real friend among them. So, though they were startled and shocked, there was no one to shed a tear over the dead. It was a moment of doubt when a leader was wanted. \"Well,\" said Robert Graham, after a pause, \"what are you going to do with me? I wait your pleasure.\" \"He ought to be served as he served the captain,\" said Fletcher, who disliked Graham, and had always been a toady to Captain Stockton. \"I say no,\" rejoined Rupert Ring, a man of medium height, but of great muscular development. \"It was a terrible deed, but had my brother—I have a brother in England, whom I have not seen for fifteen years—been in Sandy Graham\u0027s shoes, I would have done the same.\" There was a half murmur, which seemed like approval. \"And after all,\" continued Ring, \"though Sandy Graham was in fault, he is not the first man that has been beguiled by a fair face.\" \"No, no!\" was heard from several of the bushrangers. \"I don\u0027t wish to speak ill of the dead, but he drew the reins too tight at times. He forgot that we have rights.\" Again there was a murmur of assent. It was evident that he was carrying his comrades with him. \"I move, therefore, that we pass over Robert Graham\u0027s deed as one to which he was impelled by brotherly affection, and that we restore Sandy Graham to his place in our ranks, on condition that he does not repeat the offence. Those who agree with me, hold up their right hands.\" All hands were raised except that of Fletcher. \"Release the prisoner,\" said Ring, turning to the two attendants. Instantly the rope was cut, the dark cloth was removed, and Sandy Graham, a tall, athletic, good-looking fellow, stepped forth, his face pale from the terrible strain to which he had been subjected. \"Comrades, brothers,\" he said, in a voice indicating deep emotion, \"I thank you for giving me back my life. It shall be devoted to your service.\" The first to press forward, and grasp his hand convulsively was his brother, Robert Graham. \"Robert,\" said Sandy, \"but for your brave act I should have been lying dead instead of him,\" and he pointed, with a shudder, to the dead captain. \"For your sake, Sandy,\" said Robert solemnly, \"I have shed human blood. To save your life, I have become a murderer.\" \"No, Robert, you cannot be called that any more than if you had shed blood in self-defence.\" Their conversation was interrupted by Rupert Ring. \"Comrades,\" he said, \"the captain is dead. We can do nothing without a leader. We should appoint one at once.\" Here Fletcher pushed forward. \"I am the oldest in service among you,\" he said. \"I was the trusted friend of Captain Stockton. I submit that I have the best claim to be your leader.\" But among bushrangers, as in other communities, the man who is the most anxious to secure office is very apt to be left in the lurch. Now, it happened that Fletcher was by no means a favorite in the band. He was sly and sneaking in his methods, currying favor with the captain, even at the expense of manliness and self-respect, and there were serious doubts as to his courage. If he had been wiser, he would not have made a boast of his standing with the late leader, for the men were heartily tired of his tyranny, and resolved to elect someone in his place who bore no similarity to him. Rupert Ring smiled slightly as he heard Fletcher\u0027s modest claim. \"Comrades,\" he said, \"you have heard Fletcher\u0027s appeal. It is true that he is the oldest in service among you. It is for you to consider whether that entitles him to the post of leader. Those of you who are in favor of Dick Fletcher as your leader will signify it by raising your right hands.\" Fletcher\u0027s eye wandered anxiously around the circle. To his chagrin not a single hand was raised save his own. There was a cheer of derision which brought an angry flush to his cheek. Then a clear voice was heard. It was that of the young man, Wyman, whose conversation with the two boys has already been recorded. \"I nominate Rupert Ring for our leader,\" he said. There was a chorus of approval, which emboldened Wyman to add: \"As he can\u0027t very well put the question on his own nomination, I will do so. Those of you who want Ring for your captain, please hold up your right hands.\" All hands were raised except that of Fletcher. \"That settles it,\" said Wyman, who was unversed in parliamentary language. \"I call for three cheers for Captain Ring!\" The woods echoed to the lusty cheers of the bushrangers. It was evident, from the general expression of satisfaction, that the choice was a popular one. \"Comrades,\" said the new captain modestly, \"I did not look for this promotion, as you may have thought from my taking the lead just now, but I saw that it was necessary for somebody to act. I don\u0027t know whether you have made a wise choice or not, but I will do my best to make you think so. Since I am your captain, it is my duty first to see that proper honor is paid to the remains of your late captain, whom sudden death has overtaken. You two lift the body and carry it into yonder cabin.\" The two attendants did so. \"Prepare a coffin, and at daybreak we will commit him to the earth. Whatever else may be said of him, he was a brave man, and knew not fear.\" \"That is true,\" said Robert Graham in a low voice. \"As to his faults, those we have no further concern with. All of us have faults and no doubt grave ones.\" Fletcher, till now, had sulked in silence. He was terribly disappointed that he had been passed over and Rupert Ring promoted to the place of chief, but since it was so he felt that it was politic to stand well with the new administration. \"Captain Ring,\" he said, extending his hand, \"let me be the first to congratulate you on your election as our captain.\" Ring smiled slightly. He had never liked Fletcher. \"I accept your congratulations, Fletcher,\" he said, \"and condole with you on your own disappointment. We can\u0027t all be leaders.\" \"I hope to enjoy your favor, as I did that of Captain Stockton,\" continued Fletcher smoothly. \"That will depend on yourself,\" said Ring shortly. \"I would like to suggest that the two boys\"—here Fletcher turned in the direction where Harry and Jack had been standing, and ejaculated in dismay, \"I don\u0027t see them. What has become of them?\" \"They have taken advantage of the excitement and confusion to run away, I fancy,\" said the new captain quietly. This was quite true. Just after the fatal shot had been fired, and the attention of all had been taken up by the tragedy, Harry had whispered to Jack, \"Now\u0027s our time to escape, Jack. Follow me!\" \"I\u0027m with you,\" responded Jack promptly, and no one noticed the two as they vanished among the trees. \"Shall I go after them, Captain Ring?\" asked Fletcher in excitement. \"I\u0027ll take another man, and scour the woods for them.\" \"It is not necessary,\" said Ring indifferently. \"Let them go! They would only be in our way.\" \"But,\" protested Fletcher, \"Captain Stockton meant to take them into the band. They are bright and smart boys, and would grow up into useful members.\" \"Heaven forbid!\" said Ring earnestly. \"Our lives are spoiled already, and we have no chance but to continue. Leave them to grow up innocent.\" \"This is strange talk for a captain of bushrangers,\" said Fletcher, disappointed. \"Remember that I am your captain,\" retorted Ring sharply, \"and don\u0027t attempt to interfere with me! Go, I would be alone.\" Fletcher slunk away, mortified and disappointed. It was well for the two boys that he had not been elected captain.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82090.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
