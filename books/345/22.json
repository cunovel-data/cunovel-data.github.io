{"id":9751,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. — STRIKING LUCK.","content":"\"Now, boys,\" said Obed, \"we have some hard work before us. Mining isn\u0027t like standing behind a counter, or measuring off calico. It takes considerable more muscle.\" \"I am used to hard work,\" said Jack, \"but you\u0027ll have to show me how.\" \"I\u0027ll keep up with Jack,\" said Harry manfully. \"You won\u0027t have to charge either of us with laziness.\" \"I believe you, boys. There isn\u0027t a lazy bone in either of you. As I have experience, I\u0027ll boss the job, and all you\u0027ll have to do will be to obey orders.\" \"All right, captain!\" said Jack, touching his cap, with a smile. This, then, was the understanding between the three, and it was faithfully adhered to. The two boys, sensible of their ignorance, were very ready to obey Obed, and he found them willing workers. They installed themselves in a cabin which had been occupied by the man they bought out. He gave them the use of it, having no further occasion for it himself, and they began to keep house as one family. They lived roughly enough, and yet, so high were all articles of food, on account of the trouble and expense of transportation from Melbourne, that it cost them as much as would have paid for living at a respectable hotel in the States. All three entered upon their labors with high hopes. The first day and the second day yielded no results, but, as Obed reminded them, a miner needs to be patient. But when one week—two weeks—passed, and the amount of gold found amounted to less than ten dollars, all three began to look sober. \"This is beginning to look serious, boys,\" said Obed thoughtfully, as they set about their work on the first day of the third week. \"Our claim aint pannin\u0027 out very rich.\" \"My store of money is panning out very fast,\" said Harry, with a faint smile. \"I\u0027ve got less than two pounds left,\" said Jack. \"What are we going to do when it\u0027s all gone?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Obed, \"unless we catch another murderer.\" The boys smiled, but not hilariously. They felt, as Obed expressed it, that matters were indeed becoming serious. To run short of money nearly ten thousand miles from home was no light thing. \"We might sell the claim,\" suggested Harry. Obed shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think we could,\" he replied. \"Everybody would understand our reason for selling—that we despaired of finding any gold—and instead of getting twenty-five pounds, I doubt if you could get twenty-five shillings for it. You know about how long twenty-five shillings would last us.\" \"I suppose there is nothing to do but to keep on,\" said Harry. Obed nodded. \"You\u0027ve said it,\" he returned. \"Let us keep up good heart, my boys. Don\u0027t borrow trouble. When things come to the worst, we\u0027ll decide what to do then.\" By way of setting the example of cheerfulness, Obed began to whistle \"Yankee Doodle,\" and the boys joined in. It was not altogether a successful effort, but it made them feel a little more cheerful. At all events it attracted a listener—a tall, shabby-looking tramp, who had been wandering about for a day or two, visiting one claim after another, trying to raise a loan. \"I say, you\u0027re uncommon jolly, you chaps,\" he began, as he stood in a lounging attitude watching the little party at their work. \"If we are it\u0027s a credit to us,\" returned Obed dryly, \"for there isn\u0027t much to be jolly about.\" \"Isn\u0027t your claim a good one?\" \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to find out. Where\u0027s yours, stranger?\" The tramp returned an evasive answer and shambled off. \"Do you think he\u0027s got a claim, Obed?\" asked Jack. \"No; but he\u0027s prowling around to see what he can pick up.\" \"Do you think he\u0027s a thief?\" \"I think he\u0027s willing to be. He heard us whistling, and thought we\u0027d found something.\" \"We are safe from robbery for the present.\" said Harry. \"Yes, there\u0027s that advantage about being poor. It reminds me of old Jack Pierce in our village.\" \"What about him?\" asked Harry. \"He read in the paper one day that a certain bank had burst. So he went home in a hurry to see if he had any bills on that bank. He found that he had no bills on that bank or any other—and then he felt better.\" Harry laughed. \"It was a poor consolation, I think,\" he said. \"I remember hearing a sermon from our minister at home in which he said that riches were a great responsibility, but I don\u0027t think I should mind taking the responsibility.\" \"That\u0027s my idee, Harry. I am afraid there isn\u0027t much chance of our having that responsibility, but there\u0027s one thing we can do if we don\u0027t make the claim pay.\" \"What\u0027s that, Obed?\" \"We can join the bushrangers.\" \"Will you set us the example?\" asked Harry, smiling. \"I\u0027m not quite desperate enough yet. We\u0027ll try the claim a little longer. But I\u0027m gettin\u0027 tuckered out. We\u0027ll go and get some dinner and then start diggin\u0027 again.\" They repaired to their cabin, and solaced themselves with food. Then they threw themselves down in the shadow of the cabin to rest, and Obed pulled out his pipe. This was a solace which the boys didn\u0027t enjoy. They were sensible enough to know, that, whatever may be said of men, boys only receive injury from the use of tobacco. In the resolution to abstain, they were upheld and encouraged by Obed, who, veteran smoker as he was, did not approve of smoking. \"You\u0027re better off without it, boys,\" he said. \"It won\u0027t do you no good. I wish I could leave it off.\" \"Why don\u0027t you?\" asked Harry. \"Easier said than done, my boy. Let me see, I was only turned of thirteen when I used to slink off to the barn and smoke, for I knew father wouldn\u0027t let me if he knew it. It made me sick at first, but I thought it was makin\u0027 a man of me, and I kept on. Well, the habit\u0027s on me now, and it\u0027s hard to break. It don\u0027t hurt a man as much as a boy, but it don\u0027t do him any good, either. Jack, did you ever smoke?\" \"No, Obed; but one of the sailors gave me a piece of tobacco to chew once. I didn\u0027t like it and spit it out.\" \"The best thing you could do. I wish all boys were as sensible.\" In their hours of rest the three often chatted of home. Their conversation was generally of one tenor. They liked to fancy themselves returning with plenty of money, and planned how they would act under such pleasant circumstances. Instead of the barren hills among which they were encamped, familiar scenes and faces rose before them, and the picture was so attractive that it was hard to come back to the cheerless reality. \"Well, boys,\" said Obed, at the end of an hour, \"we may as well go to work again. The gold\u0027s waitin\u0027 for us.\" It was an old joke, and scarcely elicited a smile now. In fact, the boys felt that they had waited a long time for the gold. It was not, therefore, with a very hopeful feeling that they obeyed the summons and returned to the claim. Though of a sanguine disposition, they began to doubt seriously whether their efforts would ever be rewarded. They had pretty much lost the stimulus of hope. About four o\u0027clock, when Jack was at work with the pick, something curious happened. Instead of sinking into the earth it glanced off, as from something hard. \"What is it, Jack?\" asked Obed quickly. \"I must have struck a rock, Obed.\" \"Here, give me the pick,\" said Obed eagerly. He struck, and lo! a yellow streak became plainly visible. \"Boys,\" said he in an agitated voice, \"I believe our luck has come.\" \"What do you mean, Obed?\" \"I believe we\u0027ve found a nugget;\" and to the boys\u0027 intense surprise he immediately began to cover it up with dirt. \"What\u0027s that for?\" asked Harry. \"Hush! we mustn\u0027t take it out now. Somebody might be looking. We\u0027ll wait till it\u0027s darker.\" Just then the tramp before mentioned strolled up. \"What luck, friends?\" he asked. \"Same as usual,\" answered Obed, shrugging his shoulders. \"Don\u0027t you want to buy the claim?\" \"Not I,\" and the tramp, quite deceived by his manner, kept on his round. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82098.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
