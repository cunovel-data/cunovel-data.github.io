{"id":9747,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. — A DANGEROUS ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"Though the boys were very much fatigued they were up in time for an early breakfast the next morning. It consisted of muttonchops, potatoes, bread, and coffee, and they were prepared, notwithstanding their hearty supper of the night before to do full justice to it. The shepherd had got over his first impression, and nothing could be more friendly than his manner toward them. He gave a still stronger proof of his confidence and friendship. \"So you think of going to the mines, my lads,\" he said. \"Yes, sir.\" \"I don\u0027t know about the wisdom of your plans. It isn\u0027t all that find the gold they look for. Are you expecting to come back with fortunes?\" \"They would not be unwelcome, sir,\" said Harry, \"but we shall at any rate like the advantage of it, and we are young enough to try experiments.\" \"That\u0027s true; but about the gold I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 you\u0027ll be disappointed. At any rate I\u0027ll make you an offer—the two of you. Stay here and help me tend sheep. I\u0027ll give you your living and clothes, and when you are twenty-one, I will make you a present of a hundred sheep each to start in business for yourselves.\" The proposal took Harry and Jack by surprise. They could not but observe that Lucy\u0027s face brightened with hope, as she awaited their answer. It was clear that she hoped it would be favorable. It must be acknowledged that this made a considerable impression upon them. Lucy was a pretty girl, and they felt flattered by her desire that they should remain. But their resolution was only shaken, not changed. They had but to look about them at the unbroken solitude to feel that life under such circumstances would be unendurable. Both of them had led lives of activity and excitement, and neither felt prepared to settle down, but they felt grateful. \"Jack and I thank you for your kindness, Mr. Campbell,\" said Harry, \"and consider your offer a good one. But it would be lonely for us here, and, though we may change our minds, we would like to try the gold-fields first.\" \"It\u0027s only natural, lads,\" said the shepherd. \"You are young, and you crave excitement. When you are as old as I am, you won\u0027t mind the quiet. Go, then, to Bendigo, but if you have bad luck, come back here, and you shall be welcome to stay as long as you like, and to accept my offer if you feel like it then.\" \"I am sorry you won\u0027t stay,\" said Lucy, with a shade of sadness. \"I wish we could be contented to do so,\" said Harry. \"You may be sure we won\u0027t forget your kindness, Miss Campbell.\" \"Do you mean me?\" asked Lucy, smiling. \"I never was called Miss Campbell before.\" \"I will say Lucy, if you will allow me.\" \"I would rather you did.\" \"Then good-by, Lucy. We shall always remember you.\" \"And you will come back some day?\" \"If we can.\" \"Then good-by, and don\u0027t forget your promise.\" There was a suspicious moisture in the girl\u0027s eyes, for she knew that when the young visitors were gone she would feel lonelier than ever. \"That\u0027s a nice girl, Jack,\" said Harry after a pause. \"That\u0027s so, Harry. I never saw a girl so nice before,\" responded Jack emphatically. \"Do you know, Jack,\" said Harry, turning to him with a smile, \"it is just as well we are going away.\" \"What do you mean, Harry?\" \"If we stayed here till we were both young men, we might both fall in love with Lucy, and quarrel over her.\" \"I might fall in love with her, but I would never quarrel with you, Harry,\" said Jack affectionately. \"No, Jack, I don\u0027t think you would. Nothing shall ever divide us.\" \"You are very kind to a poor sailor boy,\" said Jack. \"You know a great deal more than I, and I am not fit to be your friend.\" \"Take care, Jack, I may quarrel with you if you say anything against yourself. Fit or unfit, you are my chosen friend, and I should not be willing to exchange you for anyone else I have ever met.\" \"Not even for Montgomery Clinton?\" said Jack archly. \"Not even for him, with all his stock of trousers.\" Reference was made to a young man from Brooklyn, a fellow passenger on the ship Nantucket, who had acquired the reputation of a dude, and had afforded much amusement to all on board. He will be remembered by the readers of the preceding volume, \"Facing the World.\" The boys did not set out on their journey empty-handed. Lucy, by direction of her father, had packed a basket with provisions enough to last them two or three days. The shepherd wished also to lend them some money, but this Harry declined. \"We might not be able to pay it back,\" he said. \"I shan\u0027t miss it, lads, if you don\u0027t,\" urged the shepherd. \"We might be robbed of it as we were of our other money, sir. We thank you all the same.\" But they gladly accepted the basket of provisions, without which, indeed, they might have fared badly in that uninhabited wilderness. \"How far is it to Bendigo?\" Harry had asked the shepherd. \"Twenty-five miles, or thereabouts,\" was the answer. \"If it were a straight road and good travelling we might be there by night.\"! \"But it is neither. You will be fortunate if you reach there in three or four days.\" \"Give us the direction, and we will try it, sir.\" The two young travellers, refreshed by their night\u0027s sleep and two substantial meals, made good progress, and by noon found themselves, despite the difficulties of the way, seven miles distant from the station where they had received such hospitable treatment. By this time they were hungry, and were glad to sit down at the base of a gigantic gum-tree and attack the provisions they had brought with them. They were in good spirits and chatted cheerfully. Many thousands of miles away from home, without a penny in their pockets, and with only a basket of provisions between them and starvation, they did not allow themselves to be depressed by their uncertain prospects, but looked forward hopefully. \"Jack,\" said Harry, \"it seems so lonely here, I could easily believe that we two are alone in the world.\" \"It does seem so,\" said Jack. \"I feel a little like Robinson Crusoe on his island.\" \"Am I to be Friday?\" asked Jack, with a smile. Jack had read very few books, but who is there who has not read Robinson Crusoe? \"I don\u0027t think you are of the right color, Jack, but I would a good deal rather have you than Friday.\" They were not so far away from human companionship as they supposed, as they soon learned to their dismay. Suddenly they heard a crunching as of steps upon the brush, and turning, they saw, with alarm, a tall muscular man with matted locks unprotected by a hat, a long untrimmed beard, and a suit hanging in tatters over his gaunt, bony figure. His eyes were fixed with a famished look upon the open basket of provisions. The boys started to their feet in affright. \"Give me food!\" said the stranger in a hoarse voice. Harry took some bread and meat from the basket, and handed them to the stranger, who devoured them in silence. His appetite seemed enormous, and the boys saw in dismay that if he kept on there would be very little left. It was necessary, in self-defence, to limit the man\u0027s rapacity. \"More, more!\" he cried, when he had eaten all that had been given him. \"We have given you all we can spare,\" said Harry firmly. \"Give me the basket, or I will kill you both!\" exclaimed the tramp, his eyes suffused with blood, and gleaming with fierce anger. As he spoke, he raised a knotted stick which had served him as a cane, and swung it menacingly above his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82094.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
