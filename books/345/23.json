{"id":9752,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. — RAISING THE NUGGET.","content":"\"It\u0027s lucky we covered up the gold,\" said Obed, in a low voice. \"That\u0027s the last man I wanted to discover our good luck.\" \"Shan\u0027t we keep on working?\" asked Harry, in excitement. \"I will just probe a little to form some idea of the size of the nugget,\" answered Obed. \"Then you think it is a nugget?\" asked Jack eagerly. \"Yes, I think our luck has come at last, boys. I think we will be able to pull up stakes and go back to America. But about keeping on now, we shall need to be cautious. Someone might come by, and see what we are about.\" Then Harry made a suggestion. \"Let Jack go up to the top, and if anyone comes he can whistle. That will put us on our guard.\" \"A good idea!\" said Obed. So Jack threw himself on the ground in a listless posture, and the other two continued their explorations. They dug all about the boulder, which proved to be about a foot in diameter. It was embedded in clay, from which it was separated with some difficulty. It was encased in quartz, but the interior was bright, glittering gold. \"It\u0027s a regular beauty,\" said Obed in a low tone, his eyes glittering with excitement. \"It isn\u0027t once in a dog\u0027s age that so big a nugget is discovered.\" \"How much do you call it worth, Obed?\" asked Harry in the same low tone. \"That\u0027s hard tellin\u0027, Harry; but it\u0027s worth ten thousand dollars easy.\" \"Thank God!\" ejaculated Harry fervently. \"That will release us from our imprisonment, and enable us to go back to America.\" \"You are right, Harry, but the hardest job lies before us.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"To get it out without observation, and keep it secure from thieves.\" \"We\u0027ll do our best. Only you give the orders, Obed.\" \"Then, first and foremost, we\u0027ll cover it up again, and go up till evening, when we will secure it, and carry it to our cabin.\" So said, so done. They joined Jack at the limit of the excavation. \"Is it all right?\" asked the young sailor eagerly. \"Yes,\" answered Harry. \"Is it really a big one?\" \"Yes; we can all go back to America, Jack.\" \"And I can once more be a sailor?\" \"Yes, if you like it.\" Jack was told of their plan of removing the nugget by night, and saw at once that it was a wise one. \"Shall we go to the cabin now?\" he asked. \"No, Jack; it won\u0027t do to leave our treasure unguarded. We will lounge here and make sure that no one robs us of our discovery.\" So they sat down, and Obed lighted his pipe once more. A neighbor strolled up and sat down beside them. \"You are leaving off work early,\" he said. \"Yes,\" answered Obed with a yawn, \"we might as well take it easy. It\u0027s hard work—this mining.\" \"What luck?\" \"Our luck is to come,\" said our Yankee friend. \"How is it with you?\" \"I have got out seventy-five dollars this week,\" answered the other complacently. \"Whew! that\u0027s good! What do you say to swapping claims?\" \"Oh, no,\" answered the neighbor, wagging his head jocosely. \"I\u0027m not so green. The fact is, Mr. Stackpole, I don\u0027t want to discourage you, but I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ll ever see the money you put into this hole. Come now, what did you pay?\" \"Five and twenty pounds.\" \"If you can get five pounds for it, my advice is, sell.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you\u0027re right,\" said Stackpole in a rueful tone. \"Will you give me five pounds for it?\" \"Ho, ho! I might give you five shillings, though it would be a risk.\" \"Then I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll sell, eh, Harry?\" \"We had better give it away than take that sum,\" said Harry, carefully veiling his inward exultation. They went to their cabin at the usual time and indulged themselves in a better supper than usual, feeling that they could afford to do so. It is wonderful how success stimulates the appetite. \"I don\u0027t know when I have been so hungry, Obed,\" said Harry. \"I feel the same way,\" chimed in Jack. \"A light heart increases the appetite, boys, but sometimes I\u0027ve felt wolfish when my heart was heavy. Fifteen months ago I was in Californy, and down on my luck. Things had been goin\u0027 contrary, and I hadn\u0027t money enough to buy a square meal. I didn\u0027t like to tell my friends, bein\u0027 a bit proud. One day when I was feelin\u0027 so hungry that I wouldn\u0027t have turned up my nose at a Chinaman\u0027s diet—rat pie—an old acquaintance met me and asked me to dine with him. Did I accept? Well, I should smile. I did smile all over my face, as I sat down to the table. You\u0027d better calculate that I made my knife and fork fly. Finally my friend remarked, looking kind of queer, \u0027You\u0027ve got a healthy appetite, Stackpole.\u0027 I answered, \u0027It sort of runs in our family to eat whenever we get a chance.\u0027 \u0027Good joke!\u0027 said he, laughing. But it was no joke when he came to pay the bill, I tell you.\" \"I\u0027ll remember that, Obed,\" said Harry, smiling, \"and when I invite you to dinner, I\u0027ll first inquire whether you\u0027ve had anything to eat for a week back.\" \"I generally eat for a weak stomach,\" returned Obed, venturing on a little joke at which the boys felt bound to laugh. As they sat at the door of their cabin, they kept a good lookout in the direction of their claim. They could not afford, now that success was in their grasp, to have it snatched away. But they discovered no suspicious movements on the part of anyone. In fact, no one suspected that they had \"struck it rich.\" So poor was the general opinion of their claim, that they would have found it hard to obtain a purchaser at any price. Had there been the least suspicion, the camp would have been greatly excited. As a rule, the miners retired early. They became fatigued during the day, and sleep was welcome. There was, indeed, a gambling saloon at some distance, frequented by the more reckless, but generally good hours were observed in the camp. About half past eleven, Obed nudged Harry and Jack, who had fallen asleep. \"What is it?\" asked Harry, in a drowsy tone. \"Hush!\" whispered Obed. \"Don\u0027t make any more noise than you can help. I think it will be safe to go and secure the nugget now.\" This was enough. Harry was wide awake in an instant, and he in turn roused Jack. There was no elaborate toilet to make, for they had thrown themselves down in their day attire. They left the cabin, and by the faint light of the moon, which was just ready to retire for the night, they found their way to the claim without being observed. Fifteen minutes\u0027 work, and the task was accomplished. The nugget was raised, and wrapped in a red bandanna handkerchief, which Obed had brought all the way from his New England home. \"It must weigh seventy-five pounds,\" whispered Obed exultantly. \"Boys, we\u0027re in tall luck. It was worth coming out to Australy for. We\u0027ll keep it in the cabin over night, and to-morrow we\u0027ll put it where it will be safe.\" They gained the cabin without having been seen so far as they knew. Of the hundreds of men sleeping within a furlong\u0027s distance, not one dreamed of a discovery which was to draw the attention of the whole colony to Bendigo. But they had not wholly escaped observation. One pair of eyes had detected them in their midnight walk.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82099.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
