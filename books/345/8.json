{"id":9737,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. — A VICTIM OF TREACHERY.","content":"All the party felt relieved to be rid of Fletcher. Without being able to prove anything against him, all believed him to be unworthy of confidence. Now they were a united party, and whatever might be the hardships of the trip they were ready to sympathize and co-operate with each other. They had already learned that it was no holiday trip they had undertaken. The bogs have already been referred to. In addition the heat was oppressive in the middle of the day. Then the numerous insects that infest Australia—the ants, flies, and scorpions—were most troublesome. They had to be very careful to avoid being bitten, for the bite of any these is severe and dangerous. On the day succeeding their parting from Fletcher they accomplished but six miles, the road being unusually swampy. \"I feel about tuckered out,\" said Obed, about the middle of the afternoon, just after he had extricated the team, by great personal effort, from a morass. \"If I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 known as much of the country before startin\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t have started at all.\" \"It\u0027s a long road that has no ending,\" said Harry, smiling. He, too, was very tired, but youth is hopeful. \"It\u0027s the worst country I ever travelled in, by a long shot. If I ever make my pile, I\u0027ll take the first steamer back to Frisco.\" \"Who\u0027s that?\" suddenly exclaimed Jack. Obed and Harry, looking up, saw a forlorn-looking figure approaching them. It was a man of middle age, and emaciated in appearance, looking the image of despair. He tottered rather than walked, from exceeding weakness. \"For Heaven\u0027s sake give me something to eat! I am almost famished,\" he cried. \"Why, certainly, friend,\" answered Obed, rising and advancing to meet the stranger. \"We don\u0027t keep a first-class hotel, but you\u0027re welcome to what we\u0027ve got. Are you travellin\u0027 alone?\" \"Yes, if you call it travelling. I\u0027ve been dragging myself along for several days, hoping to find somebody that would give me aid.\" \"Well, you\u0027ve found somebody. Here, sit down, for you don\u0027t seem able to stand, and we\u0027ll provide for you. Harry, bring some biscuit and cold meat, won\u0027t you, and Jack had better build a fire. A cup of tea will put new life into you, my friend.\" The biscuit were soaked in water and given to the stranger. He devoured them like a man in the last stages of hunger. \"Go slow, my friend. Your stomach must be weak,\" said Obed. \"If you only knew the gnawing at my vitals,\" said the new-comer. \"I have not tasted food for three days.\" \"I never was in that fix, though I did go hungry for twenty-four hours once in Californy. You\u0027d better believe I pitched in when I got to where victuals were.\" \"How did that happen, Mr. Stackpole?\" asked Harry. \"I was lost in the mountains,\" answered Obed, \"and couldn\u0027t find any trace of a livin\u0027 creature except an old miser, who pointed a musket at me, and didn\u0027t dare to let me into his hut. I don\u0027t think I could have stood it three days.\" \"That goes to the right spot,\" said the stranger, after he had gulped down two cups of tea. \"Now I\u0027m ready to die without complaining.\" \"If it\u0027s all the same to you, I think you\u0027d better get ready to live,\" said Obed. \"I\u0027d rather die now than suffer as I have done in the last three days,\" \"You won\u0027t have to. We\u0027ve got plenty and to spare.\" \"But I have no money. I have been robbed of everything.\" \"Robbed! How is that?\" \"It\u0027s rather a long story. You may not have patience to hear it.\" \"We\u0027ve got time enough, and patience enough, but perhaps you don\u0027t feel strong enough to talk.\" \"I didn\u0027t before you relieved my hunger. The food and the tea have put new life into me, as you predicted they would.\" \"Then go ahead, stranger. We\u0027re all anxious to hear your story.\" \"I am an Englishman,\" began the unknown, \"and my name is Ralph Granger. When the report reached England of the richness of the Australian gold-fields, I sold out my business, and was among the first to come out here. By the sale of my business I realized about five hundred pounds. Three hundred I left with my wife—I have no children—to keep her while I was gone. It is very fortunate that I took this precaution and left her so well provided for, since, had I brought all my money with me, it would all have been lost.\" The three adventurers looked at each other soberly. The ill fortune of their new acquaintance did not augur very well for their good fortune. \"Then you had bad luck,\" said Harry inquiringly. \"On the contrary I had good luck,\" replied the stranger. \"Good luck!\" repeated Harry in surprise. \"Then how——\" \"How did I come into this plight? That is what you were about to ask?\" \"Yes.\" \"You will soon learn. On reaching this country I was in doubt whether to go to Ballarat or Bendigo, but finally decided upon the latter.\" \"We are bound for Bendigo,\" said Jack. \"So I inferred. Ballarat is in a different direction. Very well, I reached Bendigo three months since. For a time I was unlucky. I found next to no gold, and the prices of living used up about all the money I had left after the expense of getting there. Just when I was on the point of giving up in despair my luck turned. I made a strike, and during the next six weeks I unearthed gold to the value of a thousand pounds.\" \"That certainly wasn\u0027t bad luck.\" \"It was extraordinarily good luck, and naturally drew the attention of the rest of the camp. This was unfortunate, for in such a settlement, as may well be supposed, there are many reckless adventurers, ex-convicts, and men utterly destitute of principle.\" \"Then you were robbed at the camp?\" \"Not then nor there. I took the precaution to send the greater part of my money to Melbourne by experts. Destitute and lost, I have six hundred pounds in Melbourne awaiting my arrival, but for all that, I should probably have starved to death but for my opportune meeting with you.\" \"Come, then, you\u0027ve got something to live for, after all,\" said Obed. \"Yes, you are right. Let me once get to Melbourne and I am all right. I shall buy a passage ticket to Liverpool, and carry with me the balance of my money. With all that I have lost I shall go home richer than I came.\" \"But how did you lose your money?\" asked Jack, who was eager to have his curiosity gratified. \"When I got ready to leave the gold-fields, there was no party which I could join. I did not like to go alone. In this emergency a man who had been working an adjoining claim offered to go with me. He professed to have been fortunate, and to be ready to go back to the city. I saw no reason to distrust him, and accepted his proposal. We bought each a horse, made other preparations, and set out together. He won upon my confidence, and I told him everything. He was very comfortably fixed himself, he told me, and was glad he had fallen in with me, as he had been afraid of being robbed on the journey. All went pleasantly for three days, but on the morning of the fourth day when I awoke I found myself alone. A little startled, I felt for my gold, which I carried in a belt around my waist. It was gone, and so was my horse. Of course you guess how it happened. My companion had robbed me during the night, and left me in the woods utterly destitute.\" \"What was the name of your companion?\" asked Obed quickly. \"He called himself Fletcher.\" \"I thought so!\" exclaimed Obed, slapping his leg with emphasis. \"We know the gentleman a little ourselves.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82084.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
