{"id":9761,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. — OBED IN A TIGHT PLACE.","content":"It must be confessed that the reflections of Obed and the two boys were far from pleasant. The cup of happiness had been dashed from their lips just as they had begun to taste it. Then again it was very mortifying to watch the exultation of Fletcher and Colson, who had finally triumphed over them after being successfully baffled. \"The worst of it is,\" said Obed to Harry, who was walking alongside of him, \"that them skunks have got the best of it. It\u0027s their time to crow now.\" \"That\u0027s the way I feel,\" said Harry soberly. \"I believe I would rather have lost twice as much to anybody else.\" \"We haven\u0027t lost all, that\u0027s a comfort. They will take the money we have with us, but if ever we escape to Melbourne, there is the nugget money waiting for us.\" Just then Colson stepped up with a smile on his face. \"It strikes me I\u0027ve got about even with you, friend Stackpole,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t call me friend, Colson; I don\u0027t own any man as friend who acts like you. So you\u0027re a bushranger, are you?\" \"Certainly not,\" answered Colson, amazed. \"It looks like it,\" remarked Obed significantly. \"I am merely in the company of the bushrangers just at present.\" \"Aiding and abetting them in their scheming. That\u0027s so, isn\u0027t it?\" \"No.\" \"You haven\u0027t any interest in the plunder, then?\" Now, one of the bushrangers was within hearing, and Colson didn\u0027t venture to say \"No,\" or it would be virtually giving up his share of the money taken from Obed and the boys. \"I don\u0027t care to answer any of your questions,\" he said stiffly. \"I don\u0027t wonder—not a mite, Colson. Still I\u0027d like to ask one.\" \"What is it? I don\u0027t promise to answer it, though.\" \"Didn\u0027t you find that nugget rather heavy?\" asked Obed slyly. Colson didn\u0027t answer, but frowned, for the subject was a sore one. \"How many miles did you carry it, if I may be so bold?\" \"I don\u0027t care to discuss the subject.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t if I were you. It makes me laugh when I think how you must have looked when you found out it was nothing but common rock.\" \"How much does it weigh?\" inquired Colson, in a tone of curiosity. \"Somewhere between fifty and five hundred pounds. Are you thinking of attacking the guard? I wouldn\u0027t if I were you. They are prepared for gentlemen of your kind. You\u0027d be more likely to carry off lead than gold.\" \"Confound the fellow!\" thought Colson. \"He looks as if he had the best of me—I must worry him a little.\" \"Do you know that you are in a very ticklish position?\" he asked. \"I can\u0027t say it\u0027s a position I fancy much. Did you put our friends here on the track?\" \"Yes, I did,\" answered Colson in a tone of satisfaction. \"I thought so. That identifies you with them, Colson. You may find it used against you in a court of justice.\" \"I am no more a bushranger than you are,\" said Colson uneasily. \"I would respect you more if you was, Colson. They\u0027re open and aboveboard, anyway. You want to profit by the same means, but sneak out of it and say you\u0027re not a bushranger. It\u0027ll be hard to persuade the courts of that.\" \"I have nothing to do with courts.\" \"You may have yet. Let me give you a piece of advice.\" \"What is it?\" demanded Colson suspiciously. \"Join the band permanently. You\u0027re a man after Fletcher\u0027s own heart. You and he will make a good match.\" \"Who is that mentioning my name?\" asked Fletcher, who happened to be within hearing. \"I took that liberty, squire. I\u0027ve been advisin\u0027 Colson here to join your band.\" \"What is that for?\" \"I think it\u0027s a business that will suit him. His talents all lie in that direction. He\u0027ll be like a brother to you, Fletcher.\" \"What did he say?\" \"He don\u0027t like the idea. He seems to feel above you. He says he is only keepin\u0027 company with you for a short time.\" \"Is that true?\" demanded Fletcher, eying Colson with displeasure. \"I never said any such thing,\" said Colson eagerly. \"He twists my words. I have the greatest respect for the bushrangers, whom I regard as gentlemen.\" \"Perhaps that is the reason you don\u0027t feel gratified to join them, Colson?\" Fletcher laughed at this palpable hit, but Colson looked annoyed. \"I don\u0027t expect to remain in this section of the country long,\" said Colson deprecatingly, for he was very much afraid of offending Fletcher. \"Of course I can\u0027t form any permanent ties.\" \"It might be better for you to leave, Colson. I\u0027ve an idee that it isn\u0027t good for your health to stay around here very long. You haven\u0027t made a shinin\u0027 success so far. Now, as to that nugget which you stole——\" \"Do you mean to insult me? I never took any nugget.\" \"That\u0027s so. You\u0027re right there, Colson. But you thought you had, all the same. Fortunately, it\u0027s where you can\u0027t get at it.\" \"I have something to say on that point,\" said Fletcher. \"I understand the nugget is very valuable.\" \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. You\u0027re a judge. I have an idee of that sort myself.\" \"About how much does it weigh?\" \"About seventy-five pounds. I don\u0027t mind gratifying your innocent curiosity, Fletcher.\" Fletcher\u0027s eyes sparkled. \"It must be very valuable,\" he said. \"I reckon it is.\" \"At what do you estimate it—twenty thousand dollars?\" \"Not as much as that.\" \"It ought to come pretty near it, though.\" Obed did not answer. \"It\u0027s a great prize. You were very lucky.\" \"So I thought at the time. I don\u0027t feel so certain, now,\" said Obed dryly. \"I think half of it will be enough for you.\" \"What do you mean, Fletcher?\" \"I mean that we shall want half of it.\" \"How are you going to get it?\" \"We mean to hold you prisoner till half the proceeds are brought in from Melbourne.\" Obed\u0027s countenance fell. He had not thought of this. Colson\u0027s eyes glistened with pleasure. Till that lucky suggestion was made he saw no way of securing a share of the great prize. \"That\u0027s a nice scheme, Fletcher,\" said Obed, regaining his composure. \"So I think. You and the boys would still have a good sum of money. What do you say? Shall we make a little friendly arrangement to that effect? You could give me an order for half the sum realized, and on my securing it you would be released.\" \"I shall have to talk it over with my partners here,\" returned Obed. \"They\u0027re equally interested with me.\" \"Better do so now.\" \"I won\u0027t till evenin\u0027, when we have more time.\" Fletcher rode away under the impression that Obed was favorably disposed to his plan. \"When I get the money,\" he said to himself, \"I can decide whether to let the fellow go or not. I don\u0027t care for the boys, but I\u0027d like to give this Yankee a good flogging, he\u0027s so confoundedly sarcastic. Plague take it, the fellow doesn\u0027t know when he\u0027s down, but talks as if he was on equal terms with me.\" Meanwhile, though Fletcher did not know it, the train of bushrangers had steadily advanced to the neighborhood of the place where the government escort were encamped. In fact, he was ignorant that they were so near. But Obed knew it, and he was watching his opportunity to apprise his friends of his situation. Harry had noticed the same thing. Lest he should make a premature revelation, Obed placed his hand to his lips, as a sign of silence. Harry understood, and seemed indifferent, but his heart was beating fast with excitement. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82108.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
