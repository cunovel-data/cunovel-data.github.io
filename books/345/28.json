{"id":9757,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. — THE NUGGET IN SAFETY.","content":"Fatigued by their exertions of the previous days and the late hours they had kept, Obed and the boys rose at a later hour than usual. About eight o\u0027clock Obed opened his eyes, and noticed that his two young companions were fast asleep. \"It\u0027s time to get up, boys,\" he said, giving them a gentle shake. The boys opened their eyes, and realized, by the bright sunshine entering the cabin, that the day was already well advanced. \"What time is it, Obed?\" asked Harry. \"Past eight o\u0027clock. We shall be late at our work.\" He smiled, and his smile was reflected on the faces of the boys. Their success of the day before made it a matter of indifference whether they accomplished a good day\u0027s work or not. \"What are we going to do about the nugget, Obed?\" asked Harry. \"After breakfast we will carry it to the office of the commissioner, and get his receipt for it.\" \"I shall be glad to get it out of our hands,\" said Jack. \"If that is the case, Jack, suppose you give your share to me,\" said Harry, in joke. \"I didn\u0027t mean to get rid of it in that way,\" said the young sailor. \"You would be as ready to give it as I to accept it,\" said Harry. \"No, Jack, I want you to have your share. I am sure you will have a use for it.\" After breakfast the three emerged from the cabin, bearing the precious nugget with them. They did not meet anyone on their way to the office of the commissioner, for all the miners had gone to their work. This suited them, for until they had disposed of the nugget, they did not care to have their good luck made public. The royal commissioner was a stout Englishman with a red face and abundant whiskers of the same color. He chanced to be at the door of the office as the party appeared. \"Well, can I do anything for you?\" he asked. \"Yes, sir; you can give us a receipt for this nugget.\" \"Nugget!\" ejaculated the commissioner, fixing his eyes for the first time on the burden which Mr. Stackpole carried. \"Bless my soul! you don\u0027t mean to say that you have found a nugget of that size!\" \"That\u0027s just what we\u0027ve done,\" answered Obed. \"When did you find it?\" \"Well, we took it from the mine about midnight. We found it in the afternoon, but calculated we\u0027d better take possession when there wasn\u0027t so many lookin\u0027 on. I say, Mr. Commissioner, I don\u0027t think it would agree with me to be a rich man. I got broken of my rest last night, from havin\u0027 the nugget in the cabin.\" \"You ran very little risk. No one could have found out that you had it in your possession,\" remarked the commissioner. \"That\u0027s where you are mistaken, commissioner. We came near being robbed of it only an hour after we brought it home.\" \"Bless my soul! How did that happen?\" \"A pesky thief sneaked in, and carried it off, as he thought.\" \"How could he think he carried it off when he did not?\" Upon this Obed explained the trick to which he had resorted, and the commissioner laughed heartily. \"Do you know the man—the thief, I mean?\" he asked. \"Yes, it is, a man that has been prowlin\u0027 round the camp for some weeks, not doin\u0027 anything, but watchin\u0027 for a chance to appropriate the property of some lucky miner. I\u0027d like to see the fellow\u0027s face when he opens the handkerchief this morning, and finds the rock.\" \"It appears you have lost a handkerchief, at any rate,\" said the commissioner, with a smile. \"He\u0027s welcome to it,\" answered Obed, \"if it will comfort him any. I brought it away from home two years ago, and now I can afford to buy another.\" By this time the nugget had been carried into the office and exposed to view. \"It is a splendid specimen,\" said the commissioner admiringly. \"It is certainly the largest that has ever been found in this camp.\" \"Has any been found before?\" asked Harry. \"Yes; six months ago a Scotch miner, named Lindsay, found one weighing twenty-two pounds and some ounces.\" \"Is he here now?\" \"Yes, and without a shilling.\" \"Didn\u0027t his nugget benefit him any then?\" asked Harry. \"It became a curse to him. He obtained some thousands of dollars for it, and all went in three months.\" \"How did he get rid of it?\" \"In drinking and gambling. Two months since he drifted back to the camp in rags. He did not have money enough to buy a claim, but being a good practical miner he got a chance to work a claim on shares for another man, who had just come out from Melbourne, and who knew very little of mining. I hope you will make better use of your money. Are these boys your partners?\" \"Yes, Mr. Commissioner, they are equal partners. What\u0027s one\u0027s luck, is the luck of all.\" Meanwhile the commissioner was weighing the nugget on a pair of scales. The three awaited the result with great interest. \"It weighs seventy-four pounds and four ounces,\" he announced. \"My friend, it will be famous in the annals of Australia. If I am not mistaken, when it is known it will create a stampede to our mines.\" \"About how much do you think it will realize?\" asked Obed. \"At a rough guess, I should say fifteen thousand dollars. It may be more and it may be less.\" Obed Stackpole\u0027s rough face was fairly radiant. \"I say, boys,\" he remarked, turning to Harry and Jack, \"that\u0027s a pretty good day\u0027s work, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I should say so, Obed.\" The commissioner made out a receipt, which Obed put away carefully in his pocket. \"That\u0027s better than carrying the nugget round,\" he said. \"I suppose you will go to Melbourne,\" said the commissioner. \"Yes, we shall start in a day or two.\" Here Obed paused, for it occurred to him that there were practical difficulties in the way of carrying out his plan. \"That is,\" he added slowly, \"if we can raise the money. I suppose we can\u0027t borrow on the nugget?\" \"No, but I can suggest a way out of your difficulties. You can sell your claim. It will realize a good round sum, as the one from which the nugget has been taken.\" \"That\u0027s so, Mr. Commissioner. Thank you for the suggestion. Boys, there is still some business before us. We\u0027ll realize something extra, it seems. I don\u0027t care how much, if it\u0027s only enough to take us to Melbourne.\" Just then a miner entered the office, and seeing the nugget instantly made it his purpose to report the lucky find throughout the camp. The effect was instant and electrical. Every miner stopped work, and there was a rush to the commissioner\u0027s office to see the nugget. All were cheered up. If there was one nugget, there must be more. Confidence was restored to many who had been desponding. Obed and the two boys were the heroes of the hour, and the crowd came near lifting them on their shoulders, and bearing them off in triumph. Obed felt that this was a good time to sell the claim. \"Boys,\" he said, \"we struck it rich and no mistake. How rich I don\u0027t know. There may be other nuggets where this came from. But I and my partners want to go back to America. The claim\u0027s for sale. Who wants it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82104.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
