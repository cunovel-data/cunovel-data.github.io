{"id":9754,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. — THE MIDNIGHT ROBBERY.","content":"The thief had little difficulty in entering the cabin. No one in the mining settlement thought of locking the outer door or closing the windows. In many cases the doors were left ajar; in some cases there were none. It was not necessary, therefore, to become a housebreaker. Entrance then was the least difficulty. The tramp, however, was not quite easy in his mind. He didn\u0027t care for the two boys, but he glanced with apprehension at the reclining figure of the tall gaunt Yankee, who was thin but wiry, and possessed of more than ordinary physical strength. \"If he should tackle me,\" thought the midnight visitor with a shudder, \"it would be all up with me. He could shake the life out of me.\" But the stake was a valuable one—it would in all probability make him comfortable for life, if judiciously husbanded—and Obed\u0027s slumber seemed so profound that there appeared to be no risk. Nevertheless the tramp trembled, and his heart was in his mouth as he stealthily got in through the open window, and moved toward the nugget, or what he supposed to be such. He had one eye on Obed as he reached for the bundle. It was with difficulty that he could lift it, so heavy was it, but this only encouraged him, and made his eyes sparkle covetously. The heavier it was, the more valuable it must be. Were it twice as heavy, he would be willing to carry it ten miles, enduring cheerfully all the fatigue it might entail. No thought of the rightful owners or of their disappointment disturbed him. That greed of gain which hardens the heart and banishes all scruples, held firm dominion over him. He lifted the bundle, and as noiselessly as he entered he made his egress through the window. He thought he was unobserved, but he was mistaken. Harry Vane was usually a heavy sleeper. He had slept through many a thunder-storm at home, and under ordinary circumstances he would have slept through this entire night. But the thought of the nugget, even in his sleeping hours, weighed upon him and entered into his dreams. Singularly, he was dreaming at this very moment that it was being stolen, and in the intensity of his excitement all at once he became broad awake, just as the thief was disappearing through the window. With a startled look he glanced toward the place where the false nugget had been placed. It was gone! Evidently the thief had been taken in, and the thought amused him so much that he almost unconsciously laughed aloud. The sound fell on the ears of the receding thief, and filled his heart with apprehension, though he fancied it was a sound emitted in sleep. Still, it might precede awakening. Once out of the window he did not stand upon the order of his going, but fled with a speed remarkable considering the weight of the bundle he carried. Harry rose from his bed, and though he felt sure the thief had been deceived, he still, in order to make sure, opened the trunk and felt for the lump of gold. With a thrill of joy he found it still there. Then he could give way to his sense of amusement, and laughed long and loud. He did not, however, arouse Jack and Obed, who, like himself, were sound sleepers. He didn\u0027t like, however, to have all the amusement to himself, so he shook the Yankee till he awoke. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Obed, in a drowsy tone. \"We\u0027ve been robbed,\" answered Harry. \"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Stackpole in dismay, bounding from his pallet, now thoroughly awake. \"What is that you say?\" \"The nugget is gone!\" said Harry. \"Confusion!\" ejaculated Obed. \"When? Who took it?\" \"Don\u0027t be alarmed, Obed,\" said Harry quietly. \"It\u0027s only the bogus nugget. The real one is safe where we hid it.\" \"Tell me all about it, Harry. What skunk has been in here?\" \"You know the man that was spying about our claim—the tramp.\" \"Did you see him?\" \"Not till he was just getting out of the window.\" Harry recounted briefly his sudden awakening, and the sight that greeted him as he opened his eyes. \"I wish I\u0027d been awake. I\u0027d have boosted him out of that window,\" said Obed grimly. \"I have no doubt you would, Obed,\" said Harry, laughing, \"but I think we needn\u0027t feel much of a grudge against the poor fellow. When he comes to examine his booty by daylight, it\u0027s my impression he\u0027ll feel sick enough.\" Obed laughed too. \"I\u0027d like to be looking on when he makes the discovery,\" he said. \"He\u0027ll look green enough, I guess.\" \"How could the fellow have found out that we had found it?\" said Harry, with a puzzled expression. \"He must have been out late and seen us coming from the mine.\" \"It is lucky we thought of hiding it, and leaving the rock in its place, Obed.\" \"That\u0027s so. The rock came in handy for once.\" \"Do you think there is any danger of another visit to-night?\" \"No; he probably won\u0027t discover how he has been tricked till morning.\" \"And even if he does he may suppose that this rock is what we brought with us.\" \"Possibly. Still, Harry, I think we\u0027d better keep awake and watch to-night. It will only be for one night, as to-morrow we can make arrangements to send the nugget by express to Melbourne.\" \"I thought we should be carrying it there ourselves.\" \"No, it would not be safe. To-morrow everybody will know that we have found a nugget, and if we attempted to carry it ourselves we should not get ten miles away without being attacked, and perhaps killed.\" \"Then we can send it by express?\" queried Harry. \"Yes, I have inquired into this—not that I thought we would be lucky enough to need the information. The government escorts charge one per cent., and besides the Crown exacts a royalty of ten per cent.\" \"That\u0027s pretty steep, isn\u0027t it, Obed?\" \"I will cheerfully bear my part of it,\" said Obed. \"I remember there was an old fellow in our place who owned considerable property—at any rate he was taxed for fifteen thousand dollars. Whenever taxes became due he was always groanin\u0027 and predictin\u0027 that he\u0027d end his days in the poorhouse. My father, who was only taxed for fifteen hundred, said to him one day, \u0027Mr. Higgins, if you\u0027ll give me half of your property, I\u0027ll agree to pay taxes on the whole, so that you\u0027ll have nothing to pay.\u0027\" \"Did he accept?\" asked Harry, with a smile. \"Not much, but he stopped growlin\u0027. It may have given him a new idea of the matter.\" \"How soon do you think of getting away, Obed?\" \"As soon as we have sold the claim,\" answered the Yankee. \"When it gets reported round the camp what we\u0027ve found there\u0027ll be plenty that\u0027ll want to buy it on speculation, you may be sure of that.\" \"I didn\u0027t think of that,\" said Harry, his eyes brightening. \"We\u0027re luckier than I thought.\" \"Yes,\" answered Obed jocularly, \"we\u0027re men of property now. I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll have to pay taxes ourselves when we get home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82101.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
