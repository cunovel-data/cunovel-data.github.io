{"id":9763,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. — FAREWELL TO MELBOURNE.","content":"No further adventures or dangers befell the party on their way to Melbourne. It was thought possible that Captain Ring, in charge of the main body of the bushrangers, might attempt a rescue of his companions. No such attack took place. It might have been that he feared the issue of the conflict, but it is also possible that he experienced no poignant regret at the capture of Fletcher, who, he well knew, would have been glad to succeed him in command. At first Fletcher was buoyed up by the hope of a rescue. Then, when that hope faded out, he sought for an opportunity to escape. In one case he would have succeeded but for the vigilance of Obed Stackpole. The latter, awakening suddenly, saw Fletcher, who in some way had got out of his fetters, stealing quietly away. He sprang to his feet and intercepted the fugitive. \"What, Fletcher! you don\u0027t mean to say you are goin\u0027 to leave us without sayin\u0027 goodby? We can\u0027t spare you, really.\" Fletcher tried to shake himself free from the Yankee\u0027s detaining grasp. \"Let me alone, you scarecrow!\" he exclaimed fiercely. \"Thank you for the compliment, Fletcher,\" said Obed. \"I aint so han\u0027some as you are, that\u0027s a fact, but I guess I\u0027m a good deal better.\" As he spoke his grip became stronger, and Fletcher found his efforts to escape absolutely futile. \"I should like to choke you,\" he said fiercely. \"I\u0027ve no doubt you would, Fletcher. It would be a nice amusement for you, but I\u0027m not quite ready for the operation just yet. When I am I\u0027ll let you know.\" \"But for you, I would have got away,\" said Fletcher, in bitter disappointment. \"I guess you would. It\u0027s lucky I opened my eyes in time. There\u0027d have been mournin\u0027 in this camp if you\u0027d got away, Fletcher. You\u0027re wastin\u0027 yourself in the woods. You\u0027re fitted to adorn Melbourne society, and it won\u0027t be my fault if you don\u0027t arrive there.\" At that moment Captain Forbush awoke. \"What\u0027s happened?\" he asked anxiously. \"One of our friends was takin\u0027 French leave, that\u0027s all,\" said Obed. \"I woke just in time to persuade him to stay a little longer.\" \"Ha! so Fletcher was trying to escape, was he? I am indebted to you, Mr. Stackpole, for frustrating his plan. We can\u0027t spare him at all events. I would rather lose any two of his companions.\" \"You see, Fletcher, how much we value your society,\" said Obed. \"It was cruel in you to leave us.\" \"You\u0027re a fool!\" exclaimed Fletcher, darting a look of hate at Obed. \"You never did appreciate me, Fletcher. All I want is your good.\" Fletcher was secured in such a way that escape was no longer possible. In due time he and his comrades reached Melbourne as captives, and were transferred to the civil authorities. It may be well to add here that they were tried, and sentenced to a prolonged term of imprisonment. Colson and Ropes fared a little better, their term being only half as long. They submitted sullenly to their fate, but singularly seemed more embittered against Obed Stackpole than against any of the officers through whose hands they passed. Obed would have fared badly had he fallen unprotected into their hands. It was a joyful day for our young hero, as well as his three companions, when they saw rising before them the roofs and spires of Melbourne. During the weeks that had elapsed since their departure, they had not only \"roughed it,\" but they had met with a series of adventures which were pleasanter to remember than to pass through. Twice they had been captives, but each time they had been providentially rescued. Harry felt that God had watched over him, and delivered him from danger and the schemes of wicked men, and his confidence and trust in an Overruling Power were stronger than ever. It was some days before they secured the money resulting from the disposal of the nugget. When the matter was finally arranged, they found themselves in possession of about sixteen thousand dollars. This included the sum realized from the sale of the mining claim. \"That gives us about five thousand three hundred dollars apiece,\" said Harry, after a brief calculation. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" said Jack, who really seemed bewildered by his good fortune. \"Why, it\u0027s wonderful!\" \"So it is, Jack. I dare say you are the richest young sailor of your age in the world.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that, but I feel as rich as a Vanderbilt.\" \"When does the next steamer start, Obed?\" \"In four days. Can you be ready in that time?\" \"I would get ready to start to-morrow if necessary.\" \"So would I. Melbourne is a nice city, but I\u0027d rather be on dad\u0027s farm, eatin\u0027 supper in the old kitchen, than in the best hotel here.\" \"After all, there\u0027s no place like home, Obed.\" \"That\u0027s a fact, but perhaps Jack doesn\u0027t feel so.\" \"My home isn\u0027t what it was once,\" said Jack soberly. \"If mother hadn\u0027t married again it would have been different, but I never can like or respect my step-father.\" \"There\u0027s one place you ought to visit before you start for home, Harry,\" suggested Obed. \"I mean to see the city pretty thoroughly before I go, as I don\u0027t imagine I shall ever come this way again.\" \"That\u0027s all right, but it isn\u0027t what I mean.\" \"What then?\" \"Do you remember the old gentleman you saved from a ruffian the night before you started for the mines?\" \"Mr. Woolson, yes.\" \"You ought to call, you and Jack.\" \"I\u0027ll go this morning. Will you come too, Jack?\" \"I\u0027ll go with you anywhere, Harry,\" said the young sailor, whose affection and admiration for Harry were very strong. About ten o\u0027clock the boys entered the office of Mr. Woolson. It was situated in one of the handsomest blocks in Little Collins Street, and they learned that he was a wholesale merchant and importer. \"Is Mr. Woolson in?\" Harry asked of a clerk. \"He is in the inner office. Have you business with him?\" \"Yes.\" Admitted into the inner office, the boys saw the old gentleman seated at a large desk with a pile of papers and letters before him. They were by no means certain that he would recognize them, but he did so instantly. \"I am glad to see you, my young friends,\" he said, rising and shaking hands with them. \"I have thought of you often, and of the great service you did me. Have you just returned from the mines?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I hope you have had good luck.\" \"Wonderful luck. Jack and I are worth over five thousand dollars apiece.\" \"Bless my soul! Why it only seems a week since you went away.\" \"It is nearly three months, and seems longer to us, for we have passed through a great deal.\" \"I shall be glad to hear a full account, but I have not time in business hours. Will you do me the favor to dine with me at my house to-night and spend the evening?\" \"With pleasure, sir.\" \"Then I shall expect you. The hour is six o\u0027clock sharp.\" The boys met the engagement, and passed the time most agreeably. Jack felt a little bashful, for Mr. Woolson lived in fine style, and Jack was not used to an elegant house or table. When the cloth was removed, Mr. Woolson asked the boys their plans. \"We intend to sail for New York next Saturday,\" said Harry. \"That is as far as we have got.\" \"If you were willing to stay in Melbourne, I would give you a place in my counting-room.\" \"Thank you, sir, but I prefer to live in America.\" \"Then I will give you a letter to my nephew and business correspondent in New York. He will further any business views you may have.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"And I will do the same for your friend, if he desires.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Jack, \"but I mean to keep on as a sailor; I hope some day to be a captain.\" \"I will give you a place on one of our ships, and you shall be promoted as rapidly as you are qualified to rise.\" Jack looked gratified, for he knew the value of so powerful a friend. Late in the evening the boys took leave of the hospitable merchant, and three days afterward they embarked for New York. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82110.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
