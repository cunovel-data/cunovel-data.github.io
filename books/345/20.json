{"id":9749,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. — THE BOYS ARRIVE AT BENDIGO.","content":"\"You are entitled to half the reward offered for the apprehension of this man,\" said the leader of the police to Obed Stackpole. \"I congratulate you. Fifty pounds is a sum not to be despised.\" \"Especially when a man has been robbed of all he possesses by bushrangers,\" said Obed. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, captain, why does your government allow them rascals to roam round the country, plundering and killing honest men?\" The captain of police shrugged his shoulders. \"We can\u0027t help it, my good man. We do all we can,\" he answered. \"In my country we would soon put a stop to it.\" \"You mean America?\" \"Yes; the land of the Stars and the Stripes,\" said Obed proudly. \"It is more difficult here,\" observed the police captain. \"The nature of the country makes pursuit difficult. Besides, we have had so many convicts sent out here in past years that there is a large proportion of lawless men in the colony. Some of these men have made themselves very formidable. There is Captain Stockton, for instance.\" \"Was, you mean, captain.\" \"I don\u0027t understand you.\" \"Captain Stockton is dead.\" \"Do you mean this? How do you know?\" inquired the captain of police eagerly. \"He was killed yesterday by one of his men.\" \"What evidence have you of this?\" demanded the captain incredulously. \"Them two boys saw him shot,\" said Obed, indicating Harry and Jack. \"Tell me all about it, young man,\" said the captain to Harry. \"It will be good news at Bendigo. Returning miners are always in fear of this famous bushranger, Stockton. He doesn\u0027t care so much to attack parties bound to the mines, for they are not supposed to have much with them, but those returning to Melbourne generally carry more or less gold, and are worth capturing.\" Harry gave a succinct account of his adventures while in the power of the bushrangers, and the scene of which he had been a witness. The captain of police listened attentively. \"This is good news,\" he remarked. \"There will be a new captain appointed, of course, but there is not another man connected with the gang who can take Stockton\u0027s place or do as much mischief as he has done.\" \"How far are we from Bendigo, captain?\" asked Obed. \"Two days\u0027 journey, or perhaps more.\" \"A long distance, considering we have no money.\" \"You will have half the reward. Your share will be fifty pounds.\" \"That won\u0027t do us any good now, unless you\u0027ll be kind enough to advance us a part of that sum.\" \"I would if I were able, but I am not provided with any money beyond what I need. You and the boys may come with us, however, if you wish.\" \"I should like nothing better, captain. Once at Bendigo, and we\u0027ll manage to shift for ourselves.\" \"Very well, so let it be.\" I pass over the events of the next two days. Obed and the boys, after all their troubles, found themselves provided with an official escort, and on the morning of the third day arrived at the famous gold-fields of Bendigo. Ballarat and Mount Alexander preceded Bendigo in point of time, but Bendigo has been far more productive. As the little party descended a hill made white by the sandy dirt thrown out of the mines, they saw below them Bendigo Creek, yellow as the Tiber, running sluggishly through the valley, which on either side had been dug up by prospectors for gold. All about on the slopes of the hills and in the valley were rude huts, hastily put together, the homes of the miners. Some of them were built of solid trunks of trees laid horizontally, after the American backwoods order of architecture. The interstices were generally daubed with clay to make them water-tight, and the roofs were covered with sheets of bark, kept down by logs laid upon them. There were tents, also, made of slabs, and covered with canvas. Still others were covered with bullock hides. To Harry and Jack the sight was a novel one, and they regarded the extemporized village with interest. Obed\u0027s eyes glistened, and he rubbed his hands with delight. \"This seems like home,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just like Shantytown in Californy, where I worked three months last year. I say, boys, how do you like it?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t like to live here very long,\" said Harry. \"I like shipboard better,\" said Jack. \"I agree with you, boys,\" said Obed, \"but it\u0027ll suit me well enough if I can find enough gold here. When I\u0027ve made my pile, Australy won\u0027t hold me long. I shall make tracks for America. We have no bushrangers there.\" \"But you have Indians,\" retorted the police captain, who did not quite relish the strictures upon the colony of which he was an official. \"I would rather be captured by a bushranger than scalped by an Indian.\" \"I agree with you, captain, but the Indians won\u0027t scalp you unless you go where they are. I never saw one till I was past twenty-one.\" \"Indeed!\" said the captain in evident surprise. \"I thought they were all over the country. Why, one of your countrymen told me they would sometimes surprise families within ten miles of your great city of New York, and scalp them all. He said he was brought up—raised, he called it—twenty miles away, and was obliged to barricade the doors and windows every night, and keep a supply of loaded muskets by the side of his bed, to resist the Indians in case they made a night attack.\" Obed laughed till the tears came to his eyes, and the two boys also looked amused. \"Did you believe all this, captain?\" he asked. \"Why not?\" asked the captain, looking offended. \"My informant was a countryman of yours.\" \"He was stuffing you, captain.\" \"Stuffing me! I don\u0027t understand,\" said the captain, puzzled. \"He saw that you knew very little of America, and he practised a little on your credulity—isn\u0027t that the word?\" \"How do I know but you are doing the same now? Probably you want to give me a favorable idea of your country.\" \"I only want you to judge it correctly, captain. Why, there aint no more danger of being scalped in New York than in London.\" \"I presume not, in New York, but I am speaking of the neighborhood of New York.\" \"So am I. I\u0027ll tell you what, captain, if you can find me a case of a man that\u0027s been scalped within five hundred miles of New York within the last fifty years, I\u0027ll give you my share of the reward. Of course if it\u0027s in Canada, it don\u0027t count.\" \"I can\u0027t accept any such wager. I have no means of proving it, even if it is so.\" \"That\u0027s true, squire; but I\u0027ll give you an idea. Harry, how many Indians have you ever seen in your life?\" \"About half a dozen,\" answered Harry, after a pause for reflection. \"And you, Jack?\" \"I never saw one that I can remember.\" \"And yet you were both born in the States. You see, captain, Indians are not so abundant in our country as you supposed. Jack has never seen an Indian, but he has seen a bushranger; eh, Jack?\" \"I have seen more than I wanted to,\" answered Jack, smiling. By this time they had descended the hill, and were on the borders of the mining settlement. They had now attracted the attention of the miners, and when the prisoner was recognized there went up an angry shout, and a band of swarthy, bearded men advanced menacingly to meet them. \"Give him to us!\" they cried. \"Give up the murderer! We will make short work of him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82096.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
