{"id":9748,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. — A RUFFIAN FOILED.","content":"Harry and Jack were brave boys, and not easily daunted, but the attitude of the stranger was so menacing, and his frame so indicative of strength, that they were both alarmed. Had their need of the provisions been less urgent they would have surrendered them without a struggle, but they felt that it was a question possibly of continued life or starvation, and this inspired them to resistance. Holding the basket in his hand, Harry retreated behind a tree, and began to parley. \"You are asking too much,\" he said. \"We have given you a meal. We need the rest for ourselves.\" \"No palavering, boy!\" said the tramp roughly. \"I need it more than you do. Give it to me, or I will kill you.\" \"If I only had some weapon,\" thought Harry. While he was hesitating, the tramp with a quick movement sprang to where he stood, clutched him by the collar, and flinging him on his back put his knee on his breast, saying between his closed teeth, \"Now I will kill you, young jackanapes! I\u0027ll teach you to interfere with me.\" Poor Harry thought his last moment had come. He was powerless against his enemy, whose wild rage, shown in his distorted features, seemed capable of anything. His sole helper was Jack, who flung himself on the giant, and sought with his boyish strength to pull him away, but in vain. \"I\u0027ll choke the life out of you, you young beast!\" exclaimed the tramp, preparing to clutch Harry by the throat. The moment was a critical one for the poor boy, whose career came near ending then and there. But assistance came when least expected. A man who had approached, unseen by either of the three, jumped from the underbrush and with one powerful blow sent the tramp sprawling on the ground beside his intended victim. \"You\u0027re rather out of your reckoning, you mean skunk!\" he exclaimed. \"If there\u0027s any killin\u0027 to be done round here, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do it.\" \"Obed Stackpole!\" ejaculated the boys in heartfelt delight, and they were rushing forward to greet him, but he waved them back. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it\u0027s Obed himself. I\u0027ll talk to you in a minute, after I\u0027ve got through with this consarned villain.\" By this time the tramp, though startled and dazed, was on his feet, and preparing to make a desperate assault on the Yankee. But though quite as strong, and possibly stronger than Obed Stackpole, he had now to encounter a foe by no means to be despised. Moreover, he had laid down his knotted stick, and Obed had secured it. It was a formidable weapon, and Mr. Stackpole was quite ready to make use of it. \"Give me my stick!\" shouted the tramp hoarsely. \"I mean to,\" responded the Yankee coolly. \"Where will you have it?\" He stepped back warily, as the other advanced, holding the stick in a strong grasp, while he kept his eyes steadily fixed on his opponent. He was cool, but his enemy was enraged, and rage made him incautious. He made a desperate clutch at the stick, but with a powerful sweep Obed struck him on the side of the head, and he fell like an ox, stunned and insensible. \"That settles you, my friend, I guess,\" said Obed. \"You brought it upon yourself, and you\u0027ve got no one else to blame. Watch him, Harry, to see that he doesn\u0027t come to himself, while I tie his hands.\" Obed whipped a strong cord from his pockets, and secured the wrists of the prostrate enemy, tying them securely together. \"Will you tie his feet, too?\" asked Jack. \"No, it is not necessary. He can\u0027t do any harm now. I came in the nick of time, boys, didn\u0027t I?\" \"Indeed you did!\" said Harry earnestly. \"He was beginning to choke me.\" \"What was it all about?\" \"We had given him a meal, but he wanted to make off with the basket besides. As this would have left us utterly without food, I objected.\" \"The mean skunk! I\u0027m glad I came up in time to settle him.\" \"Won\u0027t you have something to eat yourself, Mr. Stackpole?\" asked Harry, bethinking himself that his deliverer might need refreshment. \"I don\u0027t mind if I do,\" answered Obed. \"The fact is, I\u0027m feeling kinder hollow. I feel a gnawin\u0027 at my vitals that isn\u0027t pleasant. This is prime fodder; where did you raise it?\" While Obed was eating—with hearty relish, it may be added—Harry related briefly what had befallen Jack and himself since they had parted company. \"You\u0027re in luck, boys,\" was Obed\u0027s comment. \"You fared better than I, for you\u0027ve had your square meals, while I\u0027ve had only one besides this.\" \"Where was that?\" asked Harry. \"At the same place where you passed the night. I got there about an hour after you left, as well as I can make out. The gal was very kind, and gave me a tip-top breakfast. I ate till I was ashamed, and then left off hungry. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve got such an appetite now. Yesterday I didn\u0027t have but one meal, and I\u0027ve had to make up for that.\" \"Did Lucy tell you we had passed the night at her father\u0027s house?\" \"Lucy! Seems to me you got mighty familiar,\" said Obed in a jocular tone. \"She didn\u0027t tell me what her name was. I suppose she looked upon me as a dried-up old bach.\" \"She\u0027s a nice girl,\" said Harry emphatically. \"So she is. I\u0027m with you there. But about your question—I asked her if she had seen anything of two chaps about your size, and she told me enough to show me I was on your track. She told me which way you went, and I follered. She was a little shy at first, not knowin\u0027 but I might be an enemy of yours, but when she\u0027d made up her mind to the contrary she up and told me everything. Well, I struck your trail, and here I am.\" \"I for one am delighted to see you, Obed,\" said Harry cordially. \"And I for two,\" added Jack, smiling. Mr. Stackpole seemed gratified by the pleasure evinced by the boys. \"Well,\" he said, \"we\u0027re together once more, and now we must hold a council of war, and decide what\u0027s to be done.\" \"With him?\" asked Jack, pointing to the tramp. \"With him first of all; I take it you don\u0027t want me to invite him to join our party?\" \"His room is better than his company,\" said Harry. \"I agree with you. According to my idea, we may as well leave him where he lies.\" \"But won\u0027t he starve?\" \"He can get his hands free after awhile,\" said Obed, \"but not till after we are at a safe distance. You needn\u0027t be afraid about him. Anyhow the world wouldn\u0027t lose much if he did take passage for another.\" \"That\u0027s so, Obed, but I wouldn\u0027t like to feel that we were responsible for his death.\" At this moment the prostrate man opened his eyes, and as his glance lighted on Obed, they gleamed with the old look of rage. He tried to get up, and of course discovered that his hands were tied. \"Loosen my hands, you scoundrel!\" he exclaimed. \"If you mean me by that pet name, my esteemed friend,\" said Obed, \"I respectfully decline. I\u0027d rather look at you with your hands tied.\" \"Do you want me to kill you?\" demanded the tramp furiously. \"Not at present! when I do I\u0027ll let you know. Come, boys, we may as well be going. This gentleman would rather be left alone.\" \"Unloose me first, and I won\u0027t harm you,\" said the other, trying to struggle to his feet. \"I don\u0027t mean you shall. Good-by, my friend. I can\u0027t say I wish to meet you again. I will take the liberty to carry off your stick, as you won\u0027t need it with your hands tied.\" Obed and the boys started off, followed by the most fearful execrations from their late acquaintance. They had scarcely gone a quarter of a mile when they met two mounted police, who halted their horses and inquired: \"Have you seen anything of a man, tall and spare, dark hair and eyes. We have traced him to this neighborhood, and think he must be near.\" \"What has he done?\" asked Obed curiously. \"Murdered a man at the mines, in a drunken brawl.\" \"We\u0027ve just parted company with him,\" said Obed. \"I found him experimentin\u0027 on my young friend here, but come up in time to block his game.\" \"Put us on his track, and we will share the reward of a hundred pounds with you.\" \"I\u0027ll do it. Boys, stay here and I\u0027ll go back with these gentlemen. I\u0027ll join you in an hour.\" Obed was as good as his word. Within an hour he was back again, with the two policemen, followed by the man whom we have called the tramp. His hands were more securely fastened now by a pair of handcuffs. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82095.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
