{"id":9745,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. — THE SHEPHERD\u0027S HUT.","content":"Not feeling their fatigue so much now that they were buoyed up by the hope of shelter and food, the two boys plodded on. The way was at times difficult, and there was no glimpse of the light which Jack had seen from the tree-top. \"Do you think you are on the right track, Jack?\" asked Harry anxiously. \"Yes, I feel sure of it,\" answered the young sailor. \"It would be very unlucky if we had wandered from the right direction.\" \"Yes, I should feel like lying down and giving up, but I am sure I am right.\" Events proved that Jack was right. They came to an open place, from which they could distinctly see the light gleaming from a dwelling only forty rods away. \"There, what did I tell you?\" demanded Jack triumphantly. \"You are right, Jack. I am glad enough to admit it. Now the question is, will the people who occupy the house let us in?\" \"They can\u0027t be so inhuman as to refuse. Pass on, Harry.\" They were not long in reaching the hut. It was one of those slab huts which are used by shepherds. They are lonely enough, the stations being in some instances twenty miles from the nearest dwelling. This was a single dwelling, the home of one of the out keepers. The chief stations are usually an aggregation of dwellings. In the yard was a pile of wood for fuel. Close at hand was a paddock surrounded by a rail fence, over which hung a number of sheepskins. All these evidences of habitation cheered the hearts of the lonely boys. Harry went up to the door and knocked. His knock appeared to create some commotion inside. A voice was heard, and then there was audible the barking of a dog, but no one came to the door. \"Suppose you knock again, Harry,\" said Jack. \"They must have heard my first knock. Perhaps they don\u0027t want to let us in.\" However, Harry knocked again. Again the dog inside barked, this time with fierce emphasis. \"Is there no one inside but the dog?\" thought Harry anxiously. Having no weapon with him, he took a piece of a broken rail, so that in case of necessity he might have a means of defence. He was about to venture on a third knock when a tremulous voice, which the boys at once recognized as that of a girl, was heard from within. \"Who are you? What do you want?\" \"We are two boys who have lost our way, and are almost starved,\" answered Harry. \"For Heaven\u0027s sake let us in, and give us something to eat.\" There was a pause, the girl being evidently undecided. \"Are there only two of you?\" she asked. \"Only two.\" \"You are sure there is no one with you?\" \"No one.\" \"And you are boys?\" \"Yes.\" \"What brings you here—in this lonely place, at this hour?\" \"We are on our way to the gold-fields of Bendigo.\" \"But this is off the road.\" \"I know it. The fact is, we were captured by the bushrangers, and have made our escape. We plunged into the woods, thinking we were less likely to be caught and carried back.\" There was a change in the girl\u0027s tone as she said: \"Is this really true? You are not bushrangers yourselves?\" \"No, I hope not,\" answered Harry with a boyish laugh. This laugh, which sounded natural and genuine, evidently inspired the girl with confidence. \"If I let you in, will you promise to do no mischief?\" she asked. \"You shall have no cause to regret admitting us, we promise that.\" There was still a little pause of indecision, and then a bolt was drawn, and the door opened. The two boys saw in the doorway a pleasant-faced girl of fourteen, whose eyes fell upon them not without a shade of anxiety. But when she saw that the two visitors were boys not much older than herself, there was a look of relief, and she said: \"I will trust you. Come in if you like. Hush, Bruno!\" This was addressed to a large shepherd dog that stood beside her, eying them suspiciously. A weight seemed lifted from the hearts of the two boys, as they caught sight of the comfortable interior of the hut. On the one side of the room was a large open fireplace, on which a good fire was burning. The flickering flames helped illumine the apartment, and diffused a home-like air, which was most grateful to the two tired wanderers. \"You are very kind to admit us,\" said Harry. \"You have no idea how great a favor it is.\" \"I would have let you in before, but I thought you might be bushrangers,\" said the girl. \"We don\u0027t look much like bushrangers, do we?\" said Harry with a smile. The girl smiled too. She was evidently pleased with the appearance of her two visitors. \"No; if I had seen you, I should have known better than to think you belonged to their band. Come in and sit down by the fire.\" \"Thank you.\" Harry and Jack seated themselves on a settle near the fire, and the girl continued to eye them curiously. \"I suppose you are boys,\" she said. \"We don\u0027t call ourselves men yet,\" answered Harry. \"I never saw a boy before,\" was the unexpected remark of their young hostess. \"WHAT!\" ejaculated the two boys in concert. \"I scarcely ever saw anybody,\" explained the girl. \"My father and I live here alone, and have lived here for years. He has a flock of fifteen hundred sheep to watch and tend. Sometimes another shepherd calls here, and we had a visit from the bushrangers last year.\" \"It must be very lonely for you,\" said Harry in a sympathetic tone. \"Yes, it is; but I am used to it. Father is away all day, but he leaves Bruno to keep me company.\" \"Come here, Bruno!\" said Jack in a coaxing tone. Bruno eyed Jack dubiously, and finally walked up to him deliberately, and allowed himself to be stroked. \"Bruno doesn\u0027t think we are bushrangers,\" said Jack, smiling. \"He did at first, though,\" the girl replied with an answering smile. \"Have you been walking all day?\" \"Yes; the greater part of the day.\" \"Then you must be hungry.\" \"We are almost starved!\" said Harry tragically. \"Are we not, Jack?\" \"I am quite starved,\" said the young sailor. \"Then I must get you some supper,\" said the girl in a hospitable tone. \"Thank you,\" said Harry earnestly. \"Will you let me know your name?\" he asked. \"My name is Lucy.\" \"My grandmother\u0027s name was Lucy,\" said Jack. \"Then you may look upon me as your grandmother,\" said the girl demurely. Of course all three laughed heartily at this absurdity. Then Lucy moved about with quick steps, and soon a goodly supper of mutton-chops was fizzling in the frying-pan, sending forth savory odors that made their mouths water. Presently Lucy drew out a table, and placed upon it the chops and some cold bread. \"I would boil some potatoes,\" she said, \"but you might not like to wait so long.\" \"I think we won\u0027t wait, Lucy.\" \"You haven\u0027t told me your name,\" said Lucy as they drew up to the table. \"My name is Harry Vane,\" said the possessor of that name. \"And mine is Jack Pendleton.\" \"Harry and Jack,\" repeated Lucy, nodding. \"Yes.\" \"And where do you come from?\" \"From America.\" \"Isn\u0027t that a long way off?\" \"Yes, thousands of miles off; seven or eight, I think.\" \"You are very young to walk so far,\" said Lucy, \"but perhaps you rode. Did the bushrangers steal your horses?\" \"We came over the sea,\" said Harry. \"Jack is a sailor.\" Lucy looked at Jack curiously, as if a sailor were a strange species of animal. At this point Bruno raised his head, looked toward the door, and began to bark. \"I think my father must be close by,\" said Lucy. \"Bruno is always the first to hear him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82092.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
