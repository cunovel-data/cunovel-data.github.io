{"id":9731,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. — PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.","content":"The two boys returned to the Crown Hotel in time for dinner, of which they partook with the zest to be expected of boys thoroughly healthy. When the meal was over they repaired to the public room. \"Now, Jack,\" said Harry, \"it is necessary for us to settle on our plans.\" \"All right,\" said Jack. \"Have you anything to propose?\" \"No, Harry, you are smarter than I am, and I leave it to you.\" \"Thank you, Jack, for your confidence, but we are on a par here. Neither of us knows much about Australia. We have a great deal to learn.\" \"Then you had better decide for us both.\" \"Very well, I accept the responsibility, but I prefer to talk over my plans with you. First of all, then, shall we stay in Melbourne, or strike for the mines?\" \"Just as you say, Harry, but I would prefer the mines.\" \"I feel that way myself, and for that reason I have been making some inquiries. There are three principal localities, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Ovens. We might try one of the three, and if we don\u0027t have good luck make our-way to another.\" \"Which shall we try first?\" \"I have thought of Bendigo. I hear of one party that cleared two thousand pounds out of one hole.\" \"How much is that?\" asked Jack, who was not very well acquainted with any but United States currency. \"It is equal to ten thousand dollars,\" answered Harry. \"That\u0027s a big pile of money,\" said Jack, his eyes sparkling. \"True, but we mustn\u0027t expect to be so fortunate. It isn\u0027t everybody who succeeds as well as that.\" \"I should be satisfied with a thousand, Harry.\" \"And what would you do with it, Jack?\" \"Convey it home to my mother, Harry. But I would fix it so that my step-father couldn\u0027t get hold of it.\" \"You are a good boy, Jack, for thinking so much of your mother. I wish I had a mother to provide for,\" and Harry Vane looked sober. \"Do you know how far off Bendigo is, Harry?\" \"About a hundred miles. That is, it is seventy-five miles to Mount Alexander, and the mines are twenty-five miles to the north of that.\" \"It won\u0027t take us long to travel a hundred miles,\" said Jack hopefully. \"On the contrary, it will be a long and difficult journey, as far as I can find out. The country is full of bogs, swamps, and moist land.\" \"Then we can\u0027t walk?\" \"No; the custom is to charter a cart, drawn by oxen, which will give a chance to carry a stock of provisions. The roads are not very well marked, and are often impassable.\" This description rather discouraged Jack, who was more used to the sea and its dangers than to land travel. \"I wish we could go by water,\" he said. \"So do I, Jack, but unfortunately Bendigo happens to be inland. However, you\u0027ve got good stout legs, and can get along as well as the thousands that do go. Besides, it will give us a fine chance to see the country.\" \"Ye-es,\" said Jack doubtfully, for he had very little of the traveller\u0027s curiosity that prompts so many to visit strange lands. \"There\u0027s another difficulty besides the mud,\" continued Harry thoughtfully. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"The bushrangers.\" \"Who are they?\" \"Haven\u0027t you heard of them?\" asked Harry in surprise. \"I heard two men speaking of them last night, but I didn\u0027t take much notice.\" \"They are highwaymen—robbers, who wander about and attack parties of miners and travellers, and unless successfully resisted, strip them of all their property.\" \"Are we likely to meet them?\" said Jack eagerly. \"I hope not; but we stand a chance of doing so.\" \"When are we going to start?\" asked Jack with alacrity. \"Do you want to meet these gentlemen, Jack?\" inquired Harry with a smile. \"There\u0027ll be some fun about it,\" responded Jack. Harry shrugged his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be much fun about being robbed,\" he said. \"I would rather they would give us a wide berth, for my part.\" Jack did not answer, but from that time he was eager to set out for the mines. The hint of danger invested the journey with a charm it had not hitherto possessed in his eyes. While the boys were conversing, a tall man, with heavy black whiskers and wearing a rough suit and a slouch hat, appeared to listen attentively. At this point he rose from his seat, and lounged over to where Harry and Jack were seated. \"Young gentlemen,\" he said, \"do I understand that you are thinking of going to the mines?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Harry, surveying his inquirer with some attention. \"And you talk of going to Bendigo?\" \"Yes; do you know anything about the place?\" \"I ought to. I only came from there last month.\" \"What luck did you have there, may I ask?\" \"Pretty fair. I brought back about a hundred and fifty pounds in gold dust:\" \"And how long were you there?\" \"Four weeks.\" \"That is pretty good pay for the time.\" \"That\u0027s so, especially as I made little or nothing the first three weeks. I struck it rich the last week.\" \"What do you say to that, Jack?\" said Harry, turning to his companion; \"nearly eight hundred dollars in a month.\" \"That pays better than being a sailor,\" answered Jack, smiling. \"I should say it did.\" \"When do you expect to start?\" asked the stranger. \"As soon as we can get ready,\" Harry replied. \"You are right there. Have you got money?\" \"Why?\" asked Harry rather suspiciously. \"It will cost something for an outfit.\" \"Yes; we have a moderate sum with us.\" \"That is well,\" said the stranger approvingly. \"Do you know,\" he continued meditatively, \"I have a great mind to go with you?\" \"Then you are not satisfied with your pile?\" said Harry. \"There\u0027s very little left of it,\" said their new acquaintance. \"You haven\u0027t spent a hundred and fifty pounds in a month?\" said Harry in surprise. \"Pretty much. I may have twenty pounds left.\" \"You must have been living high, then.\" \"No. I have lived plainly, but the faro table has taken most of it. I\u0027m so near broke that I may as well go back to the mines for a fresh supply before my money is all gone.\" \"We shall be glad of your company, sir. May I ask if you are an Australian?\" \"I was born in England, but I have been out here half a dozen years.\" \"And have not made your fortune yet?\" \"It is my own fault. I have been unable to keep money after I got it.\" \"We are from America.\" \"I surmised it,\" said the stranger. \"That is a country I want to visit before I die. You have mines there, too.\" \"Yes, but they are a long way from where we live.\" \"My name is Fletcher—Dick Fletcher my friends call me.\" \"I am Harry Vane, and my friend is Jack Pendleton.\" \"We will drink to our better acquaintance. Here, John,\" addressing the barkeeper, \"three glasses of ale here.\" \"If you won\u0027t mind, Jack and I will take sarsaparilla.\" Fletcher stared at them in amazement. \"You don\u0027t drink ale?\" he said. \"We belong to the temperance society,\" said Harry, smiling. \"You won\u0027t keep that up long at the mines,\" said Fletcher, shrugging his shoulders. Harry did not reply, but quietly resolved that he would disprove that statement. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82078.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
