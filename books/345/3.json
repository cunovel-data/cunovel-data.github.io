{"id":9732,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. — FLETCHER ACTS SUSPICIOUSLY.","content":"One circumstance led Harry to hurry his intended departure. He found to his dismay that the hotel charge for their very plain accommodations was a pound a day for each of them. The Crown inn was what would be called in an American city a one-horse hotel. There are plenty such to be found in the United States where the rate charged is but a dollar a day. But Melbourne was full of strangers, drawn thither by flaming accounts of the richness of the mines and the bright prospects of acquiring sudden fortunes, and war prices were prevalent everywhere. \"Five dollars a day!\" exclaimed Jack in open-eyed amazement. \"Do they take us for millionaires?\" \"I began to think they were imposing upon us,\" said Harry, \"till I made inquiries elsewhere. I find a pound a day is about the usual tariff for such accommodations as we have.\" \"But we have only a small bedroom, and the meals are very common.\" \"That is true, but it seems to make no difference.\" \"Our money will soon be gone at that rate,\" said Jack soberly. \"Mine is already gone.\" \"No, it isn\u0027t, Jack. We are going to share and share alike, you know.\" \"But that is imposing on you, Harry,\" protested the young sailor earnestly. \"Let me judge of that, Jack; I\u0027d a good deal rather have your company and half of the money than be alone and have the whole.\" \"Thank you, Harry. You are a true friend. I can\u0027t do much for you, but I\u0027ll do what I can.\" \"If I had known of the high prices, I would have drawn more money from the professor,\" continued Harry. \"However, I can make this do. But I want to start to-morrow, if possible. We shall then be owing four days\u0027 board each, and that will make forty dollars.\" At this point Fletcher joined them. \"By the way,\" said he nonchalantly, \"I want to ask a little favor.\" \"What is it?\" asked Harry unsuspiciously. \"I am rather short of money. Can you lend me five pounds?\" Jack looked at Harry in alarm. He was afraid Harry would grant the favor, knowing his obliging disposition. But he didn\u0027t know our hero. Harry was ready to do anything for a near friend, but he was too prudent to waste his money on acquaintances who had no sort of claim on him. \"I am sorry to refuse, Mr. Fletcher,\" he said, \"but Jack and I are ourselves very poorly provided with money, and just before you came in we were considering how we could manage to pay for the necessary outfit.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got five pounds?\" asked Fletcher quickly. \"Of course we have, or we should be unable to get to the mines.\" \"Then I think you might oblige me,\" he continued, looking very much displeased. \"I am the best judge of my circumstances,\" said Harry shortly. Fletcher looked hard at him, and saw that the boy he had to deal with had a mind of his own, and was not to be imposed upon easily. Still he made a farther effort. \"Then I think,\" he said coldly, \"I shall not be able to assist you in your preparations.\" \"Just as you please,\" answered Harry promptly. \"As you volunteered, I accepted your proposal. Now I will act for myself. I have heard of a party about to start, and I will arrange to join it.\" Fletcher felt that he was outgeneralled. He did not mean to let Harry and Jack slip through his fingers, for he had an idea, notwithstanding Harry\u0027s disclaimer, that he had a large sum of money, and thought he would be a good party to hang on to. He saw that he had made a false move, and hastened to repair it. \"Excuse me,\" he said, assuming a hearty tone; \"I was hasty, and I apologize. You are right, and I like you too well to cut up rough, just because you can\u0027t do me a favor. There, take my hand, and we will make it all up.\" \"With pleasure,\" answered Harry, as he accepted the proffered hand, and Jack followed his example. Nevertheless Fletcher\u0027s demand had produced an unpleasant effect upon him. The coarse-grained selfishness of the man had shown through his outward varnish of good-fellowship, and he felt that henceforth he must be on his guard. \"I may have to ask for some money, however,\" continued Fletcher, in an off-hand manner, \"for it is necessary to buy supplies for our journey. You know we shan\u0027t be able to put up at hotels on our way, but must furnish our own meals.\" \"So I have heard,\" answered Harry. \"What is it customary to take?\" \"Well, it will be best to buy a bag of coffee, a sack of flour, some ship biscuits, potatoes, and sugar. That will do to start on, and we shall vary our diet by what we are able to kill on the way.\" \"What can we kill?\" \"Well, kangaroo meat isn\u0027t bad, and we can bring down a few birds occasionally.\" \"Then we shall need guns?\" \"Yes, it will be well to have them.\" This was another expense upon which Harry had not calculated. He began to think that he had been very improvident. The professor would readily have left him a hundred dollars more, and as it would have been repaid with his own money, he was sorry he had not availed himself of it. \"How much do you think the supplies will cost?\" asked Harry. \"Well, you had better let me have ten pounds. I think that will be sufficient.\" \"For the whole or for our share?\" asked Harry pointedly. \"For your share,\" answered Fletcher after a pause. \"It seems to me you are very suspicious.\" Really he had intended to make the two boys pay for the whole stock of provisions and save his own purse, for he had in reality as much money as they. \"I only wanted to understand clearly,\" said Harry quietly. \"As we are in some sort partners, that is fair, is it not?\" \"Oh, yes,\" returned Fletcher, but he did not respond with any alacrity. \"I\u0027m always fair and above board, I am. No man can say that Dick Fletcher ever tried to get the best of him. Why, if I was better fixed I wouldn\u0027t let you two boys pay a cent. I\u0027d shoulder the whole thing myself.\" \"Your offer is a very kind one, Mr. Fletcher——\" \"Don\u0027t say Mr. Fletcher; call me Dick,\" interrupted their new acquaintance. \"I will if you wish it, though as you are so much older, it hardly seems proper. What I was going to say was that Jack and myself are determined to pay our share. We couldn\u0027t accept any such favor as you mention.\" \"That\u0027s all right. Now, if you let me have the ten pounds I\u0027ll take all the trouble off your hands, and have everything ready for a start to-morrow morning.\" \"I would prefer to go with you and help select the articles.\" Fletcher looked disconcerted. \"Oh, well, if you think I aint capable——\" he began. \"I think nothing of the kind, but I want to learn as much as I can. I may have to do it alone some time.\" It was well Harry adhered to his determination. It saved him three pounds, and Fletcher was forced to pay his share, as he had not intended to do. While they were making purchases they were accosted by a tall loose-jointed man, whom it was easy to recognize as a Yankee. \"Goin\u0027 to the mines, boys?\" he asked in a strong nasal tone. \"Yes,\" answered Harry. \"So am I. I\u0027d like to hook on to your party if you aint no objections.\" For some reason Dick Fletcher did not appear to relish the proposal. \"I don\u0027t think we can accommodate you,\" he said abruptly. \"I think we can,\" said Harry, who was beginning to be distrustful of Fletcher, and felt safer in adding another to the party. \"There are but three of us, and we shall be glad of your company.\" Dick Fletcher looked angry, but did not venture to oppose the plan further.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82079.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
