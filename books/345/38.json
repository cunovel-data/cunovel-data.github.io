{"id":9767,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII. — THE BOYS SECURE POSITIONS.","content":"Before leaving New York, Harry Vane decided to call upon the nephew to whom Mr. Woolson of Melbourne had given him a letter of introduction. Upon inquiry, he found that John Woolson \u0026 Co. (the style of the firm) were large importers in the lower part of the city. Accompanied by Jack, he called one morning. Mr. John Woolson, a courteous gentleman, about forty years of age, received him with politeness, which changed to cordiality when he had read his uncle\u0027s letter. \"My uncle writes here that you two young gentlemen recently rendered him an important service.\" \"We were fortunate enough to save him from being robbed,\" said Harry modestly. \"And maltreated, also, I presume,\" said the nephew. \"When did you arrive in New York?\" \"Last Thursday, sir.\" \"Did you leave my uncle well?\" \"He looked in excellent health.\" \"How long do you remain in the city? What are your plans?\" \"We think of leaving to-morrow. We wish to see friends from whom we have long been parted.\" \"My uncle wishes me to offer you a position in my establishment, Mr. Vane. If that will meet your views, I shall be happy to receive you.\" \"I should like nothing better, sir,\" replied Harry, his eyes sparkling. \"Will fifteen dollars a week satisfy you to begin with?\" \"But, sir, I can\u0027t hope to earn as much as that.\" \"Well perhaps not, just at first,\" said the merchant, smiling; \"but if your looks don\u0027t belie you, it will not be long before your services will be worth that sum. At any rate I am ready to pay it.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Harry gratefully. \"When would you wish me to commence?\" \"When you please. You had better take a vacation of a month to visit your friends. Then come to the city, and enter my employment.\" Harry renewed his thanks, and Mr. Woolson turned to Jack. \"Yon have been trained as a sailor, I believe,\" he said. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Do you wish to follow the sea?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jack promptly. \"I love the sea.\" \"Then I will find you a good position on one of my ships, commend you specially to the captain as a young friend of mine, and promote you as fast as your progress in seamanship will warrant my doing so.\" Now it was Jack\u0027s turn to look jubilant, for nothing could have suited him better. \"You too will want a vacation. Take as long as you like, and then come to me. By the way, I don\u0027t know how you are situated as regards money. If either of you desires an advance, I shall be glad to accommodate you.\" \"We met with good luck at the mines,\" said Harry, \"and are both well supplied with money. We thank you, however, for your kind offer.\" The boys left the office in high spirits. \"I don\u0027t see but our prospects are bright, Jack,\" said Harry. \"I didn\u0027t think so when we were on the island,\" said Jack, \"or when we were captives among the bushrangers.\" \"No; we have certainly seen some hard times. Let us hope that we have had our share, and may look forward now to happier days.\" Now that their future was arranged, the boys were in a hurry to leave the city and visit their friends. Obed sympathized with them. \"Boys,\" said he, \"I\u0027m gettin\u0027 kinder homesick. There\u0027s an old man and a girl I want to see, and tell \u0027em of my good luck.\" \"Your father and——\" \"Suke Stanwood. Suke has been waitin\u0027 for me five years, and there aint no need of waitin\u0027 any longer. If all goes well she\u0027ll be Mrs. Obed Stackpole within a month.\" \"She may not be able to get her wedding things so soon, Obed.\" \"She don\u0027t need any wedding things. Any dress\u0027ll do to be married in.\" \"You will send us some cards and cake, I hope, Obed.\" \"Better\u0027n that: I\u0027ll send you an invite to the weddin\u0027.\" \"Then it\u0027ll have to come soon, Obed. I shall be gone to the city, and Jack to sea within a month.\" \"Then we\u0027ll hurry it up. It\u0027ll give me a good excuse. But there\u0027s one thing I\u0027m going to do before I get married.\" \"What is that?\" \"Pay off the mortgage on dad\u0027s farm. It\u0027s only a thousand dollars, but dad couldn\u0027t lift it if he lived to a hundred.\" \"And what are you going to do, Obed?\" \"There\u0027s a farm alongside I can buy for twenty-five hundred dollars, with a comfortable house thrown in. I can buy it, and have more than enough money left to furnish the house and stock the farm.\" \"I wish you happiness, Obed; but don\u0027t you think you\u0027ll ever pine to be back in Australia?\" \"I may hanker after a sight of Fletcher and his two cronies, Colson and Ropes,\" returned Obed with dry humor, \"but we can\u0027t have everything in this world, and I\u0027ll try to rub along with the blessings I have.\" Let me add here that Obed carried out his programme. He paid the mortgage, bought the farm, and in less than three weeks he was a married man. Harry and Jack were at the wedding, and received great attention from all Obed\u0027s friends. To the inhabitants of the little village it seemed wonderful that boys so young should have traveled so far, and passed through such varied experiences. \"I expect an invite to each of your weddings, boys,\" said Obed, as they were on the point of leaving him. \"One good turn deserves another.\" \"You will have to exercise a little patience, Obed,\" said Harry, smiling. \"Don\u0027t wait as long as I did,\" said Obed. \"I got to be a cranky old bachelor before I hitched horses.\" \"Mrs. Stackpole will soon cure you of that,\" said Harry, with a smile. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82114.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
