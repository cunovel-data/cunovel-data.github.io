{"id":9742,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. — A TRIAL AND ITS TRAGIC FINALE.","content":"Harry was very much disturbed by the communication of his new acquaintance, whose name he ascertained to be Wyman. It was not very pleasant, of course, to be a prisoner, but this he could have borne, being confident, sooner or later, of escaping. But to be forced to join these lawless men, and render himself, like them, an outlaw and outcast from respectable society, seemed terrible. He determined that, come what would, he would preserve his integrity and his honest name. He might be ill-treated, but they could not force him to become a bushranger. He talked the matter over with Jack, and the young sailor agreed with him. Presently the meal was ready, and the two boys were served with the rest. Notwithstanding their precarious position, each ate heartily It takes a good deal to spoil the appetite of a growing boy. After eating, the captain, clearing his throat, addressed the band: \"My men,\" he said, \"we have refreshed ourselves by eating, and now a less pleasant scene awaits us. I am your captain, and to me you have sworn implicit obedience. Is it not so?\" \"Yes, yes!\" answered the bushrangers. \"It is a necessity of our position. We have withdrawn from the world, and we lead a free, untrammelled life in the bush. We scorn the laws that the colonists have made, and prefer to govern ourselves. Is this so?\" There was a hoarse murmur of assent. \"As a consequence,\" the captain proceeded, \"we are hunted like wild beasts. Our enemies have laid plots to ensnare us, but thus far they have not succeeded. While we stand together we are safe.\" Again there were signs of assent and approval as Captain Stockton paused. \"But one thing is essential. There must be no traitor, no malcontents among us. A large reward has been offered for my apprehension—five thousand pounds! It shows how much they are afraid of us,\" and he raised his head with unconscious pride. \"Against open enemies we can hold our own, but not against the secret foe who sits beside us as a friend, and eats and drinks with us. When such a one is found, what shall be his fate?\" He paused for a reply, and it came from the lips of all in one stern word—\"Death!\" \"I am answered,\" said the captain. \"The sentence has been pronounced, not by my lips but by your own.\" Here he turned to two attendants, who were stationed near at hand. \"Bring forth the traitor,\" he said. The two men disappeared within one of the huts, and immediately reappeared, leading behind them a third, with his hands tied behind him. His face was covered by a black cloth, which effectually screened his features from the general observation. All eyes were turned on the unhappy man. Harry and Jack regarded the scene with painful interest. They guessed what was coming. \"Complete your task!\" said the captain with a wave of his hand. The two guards set the offender with his back to a tree, and producing a rope, quickly passed it round his waist and tied him securely, with his screened face toward the band. \"Wretch!\" said the captain in a terrible voice, \"you thought to betray us, and expose us to punishment and death, but the doom which you were ready to bring upon us has recoiled upon yourself. You would have sold your captain and comrades for gold. They have pronounced your doom, and it is Death! Have you anything to say?\" The victim did not speak, but slowly inclined his head in hopeless submission to his fate. \"You have nothing to say for yourself. Is there anyone to speak for you?\" One of the bushrangers sprang forward impetuously. \"Yes, captain, I will speak for him.\" Captain Stockton frowned fiercely, but uttered one word, \"Speak!\" The daring outlaw, who had stepped forward a little from the line, commenced: \"This man is my brother. We were nursed by the same mother, we played together by the same fireside, we grew into manhood together, and together we joined this band of brothers.\" He paused a moment, and the captain said briefly, \"Well?\" \"Now,\" continued the brother, \"you would condemn him to a shameful death, which he does not deserve.\" \"What!\" exclaimed the captain, his face becoming pale with anger; \"what do you dare to say? Do you question the justice of our sentence? Would you excuse a traitor?\" \"He is no traitor!\" said the brother boldly. \"Was he not caught attempting to escape? Answer me instantly.\" \"Yes, but he had no intention of betraying any of us.\" \"What then was his object?\" demanded Captain Stockton sternly. \"He meant to leave you. He had become tired of the life of a bushranger. He wished to return to the paths of honesty, and live by labor at some respectable trade.\" \"And why was this? Why, after so many years, had he become tired of our noble independence?\" \"In one of his missions, undertaken in the interest of the fraternity, he had made the acquaintance of a young girl, modest and attractive. He wished to marry her, but as a bushranger he knew this was impossible. Therefore, he resolved to leave our band, and enter upon a new life. He would never have uttered a word to imperil the safety of his captain or his comrades.\" \"And you expect us to believe this?\" said the captain with a sneer. \"I do. I swear it is true.\" \"And what do you expect me to do, Robert Graham?\" \"To consider his temptations, and to show mercy upon him.\" \"Perhaps also you expect me to release him, and bid him go his way to the maiden who is waiting for him.\" \"It would be a generous act.\" \"But I am not so generous,\" said the captain. \"Your plea is ingenious, but I put no faith in it. It is utterly improbable. You and your brother have been with us for seven years. You have become accustomed to our ways. He was faithful and loyal till the love of gold made him a traitor. What he sought was blood money.\" \"No, a thousand times, no!\" exclaimed the brother earnestly. \"I say it is so,\" said Captain Stockton harshly. \"It is plain to every member of the band. Yet, because you have never transgressed, I have been willing to listen to you, remembering that he is your brother.\" \"Spare his life at least; even if you are convinced that he is guilty. He has not lived his life half out. Be merciful!\" \"I cannot,\" answered the captain in an inflexible tone. \"If I yielded to such a weakness all discipline would be at an end. If treachery is to be pardoned, who knows which one among you might be the next to imitate the example of this man. No! justice is stern, and punishment must be inflicted. The guilty must be punished though the heavens fall. Men, stand aside!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82089.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
