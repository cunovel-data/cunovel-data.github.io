{"id":9758,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. — SELLING THE CLAIM.","content":"\"Let\u0027s adjourn to the mine,\" said Tom Lewis, a short, sturdy Englishman. \"Yes, let\u0027s see the place where the nugget was found,\" echoed another. \"All right! I\u0027m agreeable,\" said Obed. Followed by a crowd of miners, Obed Stackpole strode to the claim where he had \"struck it rich.\" In spite of his homely face and ungainly form there was more than one who would have been willing to stand in his shoes, homeliness and all. The day before little notice was taken of him. Now he was a man who had won fame at a bound. They soon stood around the lucky claim. \"It isn\u0027t much to look at, gentlemen,\" said Obed, \"but looks is deceptive, as my old grandmother used to tell me. \u0027Handsome is as handsome does,\u0027 and this \u0027ere hole\u0027s done the handsome thing for me and my partners, and I venture to say it hasn\u0027t got through doin\u0027 handsome things. It\u0027s made three of us rich, and it\u0027s ready to make somebody else rich. Who\u0027ll be the lucky man? Do I hear a bid!\" \"Fifty pounds,\" said Tom Lewis. \"That\u0027ll do to start on, but it won\u0027t do to take. Fifty pounds I am offered. Who says a hundred?\" A German miner offered a hundred, and Tom Lewis raised ten pounds. A Scotch miner, Aleck Graham, offered a hundred and twenty-five. From that time the bids rose slowly. Obed showed himself an excellent auctioneer—indeed he had had some experience at home—and by his dry and droll remarks stimulated the bidding when it became dull, and did not declare the claim sold till it was clear no higher bid could be obtained. \"Three hundred pounds, and sold to Frank Scott,\" he concluded. \"Mr. Scott, I congratulate you. I calculate you\u0027ve made a pretty good investment, and I shouldn\u0027t wonder if you\u0027d find another nugget within a week. \u0027Birds of a feather flock together,\u0027 as my writing-book says, and \u0027it never rains but it pours.\u0027\" Frank Scott came forward and made arrangements for the payment of the sum he had offered. Within five minutes he was offered an advance of twenty-five pounds for his bargain, which put him in good humor, though he declined it. I may as well say here, since we are soon to bid farewell to Bendigo, that the claim yielded him double the amount of his investment, and though this was not up to his expectations, he had no reason to regret his purchase. The little crowd of miners were just separating when two new-comers appeared on the scene. They were the well-matched pair who had met earlier in the morning at the deserted cabin. For convenience\u0027 sake we will call them Colson and Ropes, the former being the man who had stolen the nugget, as he supposed. \"What\u0027s all this crowd?\" said Colson in a tone of curiosity. Ropes put the question to Tom Lewis, who chanced to be passing. \"Haven\u0027t you heard about the nugget?\" asked Lewis. \"What nugget?\" asked Colson innocently. \"That slab-sided Yankee, Obed Stackpole, found a nugget last night—a regular monster—and he\u0027s been selling his claim. I bid for it, but I didn\u0027t bid high enough.\" \"Where\u0027s the nugget?\" asked Colson eagerly. \"In charge of the commissioner, who will send it under escort to Melbourne.\" Colson expected this intelligence. Still he looked downcast. The chance of getting hold of it under such circumstances seemed very small. \"What did the claim go for?\" questioned Ropes. \"Three hundred pounds. Frank Scott bought it.\" \"That\u0027s a pretty steep price.\" \"Yes, but there may be another nugget.\" \"And there may not.\" \"Then he\u0027ll be a loser. Of course there\u0027s a risk.\" \"Is the Yankee going to stay around here?\" asked Colson. \"No; he and the two boys are going to Melbourne. I believe they are going back to America.\" \"It\u0027s a shame that such a prize should go to Americans,\" said Colson, in a discontented tone. He would have been very glad to head a movement for robbing Obed and the boys of the proceeds of their lucky discovery, on this flimsy ground. But Tom Lewis was a fair-minded man. \"I don\u0027t see what that has to do with it,\" said he. \"They found it, and they have a right to it. Of course, I\u0027d rather it had been me; but it wasn\u0027t, and there\u0027s an end of it.\" \"Some people are born lucky!\" grumbled Colson, as Lewis walked away. \"I never had any luck.\" \"The nugget you found wasn\u0027t quite so valuable,\" returned Ropes grimly. \"No; I tugged away for nothing. My arms and shoulders are stiff enough this morning. And now the nugget is out of our reach.\" \"But not the three hundred pounds,\" said Ropes significantly. \"The price of the claim?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s true, but it won\u0027t do us any good.\" \"The Yankee will carry that with him. It\u0027s worth trying for.\" The suggestion seemed to strike Colson favorably. The two held a whispered consultation, which seemed to yield mutual satisfaction. They were, indeed, congenial spirits, and agreed upon one point, that it was better to make a living by knavery than by doing honest work for honest wages. Yet there is no harder or more unsatisfactory way of living than this. Ill-gotten gains seldom benefit the possessor, and the plans of wicked men often fail altogether. Gradually the two had drawn near to the claim, and at last drew the attention of Obed and the boys. Obed\u0027s thin face lighted up with satisfaction as he recognized the man who had attempted to steal the nugget. \"Good-mornin\u0027, squire,\" he said politely. \"You look kind of tired, as if you was up late last night.\" Colson eyed him sharply. \"Does he suspect?\" thought he. \"Yes,\" he answered, in an indifferent tone, \"I didn\u0027t rest very well.\" \"Where did you pass the night?\" \"\u0027Round here,\" he answered vaguely. \"You look as if you had been taking a long walk.\" \"You are very observing,\" said Colson, not over pleased. \"I always was. It pays a man—sometimes.\" \"I hear you\u0027ve struck it rich,\" said Colson, not caring to take notice of the other\u0027s significant tone. \"Found a nugget, they tell me,\" interpolated Ropes. \"How big was it?\" \"Weighs about seventy-five pounds!\" \"That is luck!\" said Colson, with a sickly smile. He could scarcely help groaning as he thought of his loss. \"Well, yes, it is tolerable hefty. I reckon me and the boys will be able to take it easy for a few years. But we came near losin\u0027 it, after all.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" Colson asked, but he did not venture to meet Obed\u0027s glance. \"Some skunk saw us bringin\u0027 back the nugget, and prowled round till he thought we was all asleep. Then he got into the cabin and carried it off. That is, he thought he did, but we was a little too sharp for him. We tied up a big rock in my handkerchief, and I guess he had a sweet time carryin\u0027 it off.\" \"Ha, ha! A good joke!\" said Colson, but his laughter was mirthless. \"I thought you\u0027d enjoy the joke, squire,\" said Obed. \"How I pity the poor fellow! His arms must ache with luggin\u0027 the old rock. The best of it is we know the fellow that took it.\" \"You do?\" ejaculated Colson, his jaw dropping. \"Yes, Harry woke up just in the nick of time and saw him scootin\u0027 out of the cabin. If I should tell the boys \u0027round here, I reckon they\u0027d lynch him!\" added Obed quietly. \"Just so,\" assented Colson, but his face was of a sickly hue, and taking Ropes by the arm he hurried him away. \"That fellow\u0027s well scared,\" said Obed, turning to his two young companions. \"I reckon he\u0027ll make himself scarce till we\u0027re out of the way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82105.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
