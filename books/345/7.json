{"id":9736,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. — PARTING COMPANY.","content":"\"I mistrust that man Fletcher,\" said Obed to Harry Vane the next day, taking the opportunity when, at one of their rests, the man referred to had sauntered into the woods. \"I don\u0027t like him myself,\" said Harry. \"Have you any particular reason for mistrusting him?\" \"He was searchin\u0027 my pockets last night when he thought I was asleep,\" answered Obed, and he related the incident of the night before. \"It looks suspicious,\" said Harry. \"I have not much money, but I don\u0027t care to lose what I have.\" \"I should like to shake him, but I don\u0027t see how we can very well. He\u0027s a reg\u0027lar member of the party.\" \"We can be on our guard at any rate,\" said Harry. \"I\u0027ll tell Jack, and advise him to be careful also.\" At this point Dick Fletcher returned. He looked suspiciously from one to the other, under the impression that something had been said about him. He asked no questions, however, and no information was volunteered. He could not but observe, however, that there was more or less restraint in the manner of his companions toward him, and that they were not disposed to be social. That day they made nine miles, the road being slightly better than the day before. About five o\u0027clock they reached a rude wayside inn, over the door of which was a swinging sign, on which was printed: TRAVELLERS\u0027 REST. \"We might as well stop here, instead of camping out,\" said Fletcher. \"I\u0027m agreeable,\" said Obed, \"if the tax isn\u0027t too high.\" \"Oh, Linton is moderate in his charges,\" said Fletcher. \"I\u0027ve known him a good while. He\u0027s a good fellow.\" This was not a very valuable recommendation in the opinion of Obed and the two boys, but they had no objection to becoming guests of the establishment. It was a rude building, and the accommodations were very limited. In fact, there were but two sleeping rooms. One of these Fletcher occupied, and the other was given up to the other members of the party, there being two beds. \"I\u0027d rather bunk in with you, if you don\u0027t mind,\" said Stackpole to Harry. \"I don\u0027t feel easy in the same room with Fletcher.\" \"We shall be very glad of your company, Mr. Stackpole.\" \"If I snore, just come and turn me over. I don\u0027t want to disturb nobody.\" \"I think Jack and I will be too sound asleep to be disturbed by your snoring,\" said Harry with a laugh. \"However, if there is any occasion, I will follow your directions.\" The landlord was a broad-shouldered man of moderate stature, who had lost the sight of one eye. The other, being covered with a green shade, gave him an ill look. His manner, however, was hearty, and showed a bluff, off-hand cordiality, as he welcomed the party to the hospitalities of the Travellers\u0027 Rest. He was familiarly called \"Larry,\" by Fletcher, who greeted him like an old comrade. The supper consisted in part of their own supplies, with some small additions from the larder of the inn. It was, at any rate, an improvement upon their camp fare, and the boys enjoyed it. After supper they sat down on a settle in front of the inn, but presently Fletcher strayed away into the woods at the back of the house. Some fifteen minutes later Larry Linton also got up, but ostentatiously went in a different direction. \"I\u0027m going a little ways to a squatter\u0027s to speak about some vegetables,\" he said. \"If you don\u0027t mind company, I\u0027ll go along too,\" said Obed. \"Better not,\" answered Larry. \"There\u0027s a boggy spot which a stranger is likely to fall into.\" \"I\u0027ve had enough of bogs,\" said Obed, shrugging his shoulders. \"Seems to me you haven\u0027t got much besides bogs out in Australy.\" So Linton went off by himself. After he was fairly out of the way, Obed said, turning to the two boys. \"Did you think I wanted to go off with Linton?\" \"I supposed so, as you made the proposal.\" \"I only wanted to find out if he wanted me or not. I have my suspicions.\" \"What kind of suspicions?\" Harry was the speaker, as usual, for Jack never took the lead when Harry was present. \"Fletcher and Linton are too thick together to suit me,\" answered the Yankee. \"Looks as if they was in league together.\" \"Do you think they have arranged a meeting?\" \"That\u0027s just what I do think.\" \"But they have gone in different directions,\" objected Jack. \"Bless your simple heart, my boy, that\u0027s done on purpose,\" said Obed. \"Can\u0027t they fetch round together without our knowing it?\" \"I didn\u0027t think of that,\" Jack admitted. \"Mr. Stackpole,\" said Harry after a moment\u0027s thought, \"if you and Jack will keep each other company, I will explore a little myself. I may happen to be at the conference.\" \"Be careful if you do, Harry,\" said Obed. \"Don\u0027t run no risk.\" \"I\u0027ll look out for that.\" In the rear of the house, and almost reaching to it, was a forest of eucalyptus trees. It was unfavorable to Harry\u0027s purpose that these trees rise straight from the ground, and are not encumbered by underbrush. It was very pleasant walking though, and Harry sauntered along at his leisure. He almost forgot the object of his enterprise, until some half an hour later, in the stillness of the woods, his quick ear caught the sound of voices. He was instantly on the alert. The voices, he doubted not, were those of Dick Fletcher and Larry Linton. He moved forward cautiously, and soon espied the speakers. They were sitting on the ground, under the overreaching boughs of a gigantic tree. Harry managed to get near enough to listen to the conversation, being himself concealed from view behind the trunk of a neighboring tree. \"Is there much money in the party?\" he heard Linton ask. \"I can\u0027t tell you. The boys haven\u0027t got much, but that long-legged Yankee has probably got considerable.\" \"What sort of a man is he?\" \"He\u0027s likely to prove a troublesome customer. He is muscular, as you can see, and not easily scared.\" \"Has he any suspicion of you?\" \"Yes; I put my foot in it the other night.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"I saw him sleeping like a boy, and thought there was no danger of his waking up, so I took the liberty to explore his pockets. Before I could say Jack Robinson he had me by the throat, and wanted to know what I was after.\" \"That was awkward. How did you get out of it?\" \"Lied out! Told him I was looking for matches, as I wanted a smoke.\" \"Did he swallow it down?\" \"He didn\u0027t contradict me, but it has made him watchful and suspicious. If I\u0027d got the money, I was ready to make tracks, and leave them to find their way as they could.\" At this point the two rose and walked away, leaving Harry in his position behind the tree. As soon as he thought it was safe he came out, and made the best of his way to the inn, getting there about fifteen minutes before Fletcher appeared, but without the landlord. During that interval he had time to communicate what he had heard to Obed Stackpole. \"Just what I expected!\" said Obed. \"The treacherous skunk! So he\u0027s in league with the landlord, is he? I\u0027ll fix him.\" He cautioned the two boys not to show by their manner that they had made any discovery, but to appear as usual. The next morning the party started as usual. They plodded on for almost a mile, when Obed, turning quickly to Fletcher, said: \"Let me look at that weapon of yours a minute.\" Fletcher unsuspiciously handed it over. \"I think I shall keep this, Fletcher,\" said Obed, eying him steadily. \"I\u0027m pained to have to bid you good-by.\" \"What does all this mean?\" blustered Fletcher. \"It means that your room is better than your company. We\u0027d better part.\" \"Would you rob me? That revolver is mine, and I paid for a share of the things in the cart.\" \"I\u0027ll allow you the vally of them and pay you on the spot, but we can\u0027t go on together.\" Suiting the action to the word, Mr. Stackpole handed over a handsome sum of money. \"But I don\u0027t want to sell my revolver,\" repeated Fletcher. \"What am I to do out here alone, and unarmed.\" \"You\u0027d better go back to your friend Larry Linton. He\u0027ll look out for you.\" \"You will regret this high-handed proceeding!\" exclaimed Fletcher angrily. \"Maybe I shall, and maybe I shan\u0027t,\" answered Obed indifferently. \"I\u0027ll risk it.\" Fletcher halted a moment as if undecided, then turned back, and was soon out of sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82083.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
