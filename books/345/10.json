{"id":9739,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. — FLETCHER TURNS UP AGAIN.","content":"Harry didn\u0027t need to be told that bushrangers in Australia correspond to bandits in Italy and highwaymen in other countries. The escaped convicts and desperate characters who are naturally attracted to a new country, readily adopted the wild and lawless life of the bushrangers. Stories of their outrages were common enough, and among the dangers apprehended in a journey to or from the mines, that of meeting with a party of this gentry was perhaps the most dreaded. Though Obed Stackpole betrayed no emotion, but was outwardly quiet, his heart sank within him when he saw the bushrangers strung along the road. \"I guess our trip to the mines must be given up,\" said he in a low voice to Harry. Meanwhile Harry had been scanning the faces of the men who confronted them, and made a surprising discovery. \"Look, Obed,\" he said eagerly, \"at that man on the extreme right.\" Mr. Stackpole did look. \"Dick Fletcher, as I\u0027m a living sinner!\" he ejaculated. But at this point the leader of the bushrangers broke silence. \"Do you surrender?\" he asked in brief, commanding accents. \"I think we shall have to, squire,\" answered Obed, to whom the demand was naturally addressed. \"But I would like to ask a question or two if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"Go on.\" \"Are we prisoners of war? I didn\u0027t know for my part that there was any war in this country.\" \"I have no time for foolish discussion,\" was the stern reply. \"You must give up what money you have about you.\" \"It\u0027s mighty inconvenient, squire. I\u0027m a good many thousand miles away from home, and——\" \"Peace, fool! Produce whatever you have of value.\" \"I haven\u0027t got much. You\u0027ve tackled the wrong man, squire.\" \"Fletcher, search that man!\" said the captain of the band. Dick Fletcher dismounted from his horse, and with evident alacrity advanced to the side of the Yankee. \"I think we\u0027ve met before,\" said Obed significantly. \"I think we have,\" said the outlaw, showing his teeth. \"I told you we should meet again.\" \"I can\u0027t say I\u0027m overjoyed at the meeting. However, I respect you more now, when you show yourself in your true colors, than when you sneaked up to me at night, and searched my pockets, pretending all the while to be a friend.\" \"Take care how you talk!\" said Fletcher, frowning. \"Yesterday you were three to one, now you are in my power.\" \"So you\u0027re a highway robber, are you, Fletcher? Well, I can\u0027t say I\u0027m very much surprised. I guess that\u0027s what you\u0027re most fit for.\" \"Do you want me to kill you?\" said Fletcher, touching his hip pocket. \"It isn\u0027t safe for you to insult me.\" \"Just so! You have a right to be brave with all them men at your side.\" \"What are you doing there, Dick Fletcher? Why don\u0027t you proceed to business?\" demanded the leader impatiently. \"Empty your pockets, Stackpole!\" said Fletcher in a peremptory tone. \"All right.\" The Yankee plunged his hands into his pockets, and produced in succession a jackknife, a plug of tobacco, a bunch of keys, and a couple of buttons. \"Take them, Fletcher,\" he said, \"if you want \u0027em more than I do.\" \"What do you mean with this tomfoolery?\" demanded Fletcher, perceiving an impatient frown on the face of his chief. \"Hand over your money.\" \"I guess you\u0027ll have to search me, Fletcher. You\u0027ve done it before,\" answered Obed imperturbably. \"I\u0027ve mislaid my money, and you may know where it is better than I do.\" Fletcher took him at his word, and proceeded to search, using some roughness about it. \"Be careful, Fletcher,\" said Obed. \"I\u0027m a tender plant, and mustn\u0027t be roughly handled.\" Every pocket was searched, but no money was found. Dick Fletcher looked puzzled. \"I can\u0027t find anything,\" he said to the captain. \"Rip open his clothes,\" said the leader impatiently. \"He has some place of concealment for his gold, but it won\u0027t avail. We shall find it.\" Fletcher whipped out a knife and was about to obey directions, but Obed anticipated him. \"I\u0027ll save you the trouble, Fletcher,\" he said. \"As you\u0027re bound to have the money, I may as well give it up. Just hand over that jack-knife, won\u0027t you?\" Fletcher hesitated, not understanding his meaning. \"Oh, I\u0027ll give it back to you if you want it, but I need it to get the money.\" Upon this the knife was given back to him. Obed cut open the lining of his pantaloons, and drew out four five-pound bank-notes. They were creased and soiled, but this did not impair their value. \"I guess that\u0027s what you were after,\" said Obed. \"I can\u0027t say you\u0027re welcome to them, but that doesn\u0027t make any difference to you, I take it.\" \"Is that all you\u0027ve got?\" demanded the chief of the bushrangers, looking very much disappointed. \"Every cent, squire.\" The leader turned to Fletcher. \"Didn\u0027t you tell us this man was well fixed?\" he asked. \"I thought so,\" answered Fletcher, crestfallen. \"I thought you knew it. Why, this is a contemptibly small sum, and doesn\u0027t pay for our trouble.\" \"You\u0027re right, squire,\" said Obed. \"It aint worth carryin\u0027 away. You may as well give it back, Fletcher.\" \"That\u0027s a different matter,\" continued the captain. \"Once more, is that all the money you have about you?\" \"It is, squire.\" \"Be careful what you say, for if we catch you in a lie, we\u0027ll string you up to the nearest tree.\" \"It\u0027s as true as preachin\u0027, squire. I never lie. I\u0027m like Washington. I dare say you\u0027ve heard of him.\" A further search was made, but no money was found, luckily for Obed, since there is reason to believe that the outlaw would have carried out his threat. \"The fellow here fooled you, Fletcher,\" said the captain sternly. \"Take care how you bring us any more false reports.\" \"There are the boys,\" suggested Fletcher, uncomfortable under the rebuke. \"Search them also.\" This was done, or rather it would have been done, had not Harry and Jack, fully realizing the futility of resistance, produced promptly all the money they had. So much, however, had been spent on the outfit, that between them they could only muster about seven pounds. \"Humph!\" said the captain contemptuously, \"that\u0027s a big haul, upon my word!\" \"There are the cattle and supplies,\" said Fletcher. \"They will be of use. Here, Peter, do you and Hugh drive the team into the woods, and prepare some dinner for the band. We will be there directly.\" Two men, unmounted, who seemed to be servants, came forward, and proceeded to obey orders. \"Hold on, squire!\" exclaimed Obed in alarm. \"You aint goin\u0027 to take our team, are you?\" \"Most certainly I am. If you had had a large sum in money, we would have spared you this. As it is, we must have them.\" \"But we shall starve, without money or food.\" \"That is nothing to me.\" \"Well, boys, come along,\" said Obed in a despondent tone. \"Our prospects aint over bright, but something may turn up.\" Meanwhile there was a quiet conference among the bushrangers. \"Hold!\" said the captain, as Harry and Jack were about to leave the scene with their older companion. \"You can go,\" turning to Obed, \"but the boys remain with us.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82086.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
