When the excitement produced by the fatal shot was at its height, it had flashed upon Harry like an inspiration that then, if ever, was the time to escape. He knew that it would be at the risk of their lives, and but for one consideration it is doubtful if he would have been willing to incur the peril of the attempt. But he felt that to stay was to run a risk as great that of being compelled to join the ranks of the bushrangers, and of that he had a great dread. The boys never stopped running till they had set half a mile between them and the camp of the bushrangers. Jack was the first to show distress. \"Hold on, Harry,\" he said, panting, \"I am all out of breath.\" Harry instantly slackened his speed. \"Look back, Jack,\" he said anxiously; \"see if you can discover anyone pursuing us.\" \"I see no one,\" answered Jack after a prolonged look. \"They have other things to think of,\" said Harry. \"The murder of their captain has put all thoughts of us out of their heads. When the excitement has subsided a little, I am afraid they will look for us. How terrible it was!\" he added with a shudder. \"Yes,\" returned Jack. \"I saw that man—the captive\u0027s brother—lift his weapon and point it at the captain. Almost before I could speak it was discharged and the captain fell. He must have been killed instantly.\" \"I little thought what lay before me when I left home,\" said Harry. \"I wish I knew what lies before us now,\" said Jack. \"I am afraid our prospects are rather dark. We must take care at any rate not to fall again into the hands of the bushrangers. I am most afraid of that man Fletcher. If he could have his way, he would show us no mercy.\" \"Let us go on again,\" said Jack. \"I only stopped to catch my breath.\" \"You are right, Jack. The farther we get away from the bushrangers the better.\" Before them was a densely wooded hill. The way had become difficult with the scrub bushes that filled up the distance between the trees. The latter were no longer the same which they had hitherto encountered, the tall and stately eucalyptus, but were smaller and wider branched. \"We can\u0027t make our way here, Harry,\" said Jack despondently. \"Oh, yes, we can. Besides, don\u0027t you see, the rougher and more difficult the way, the less are we likely to be followed. I am willing to go through a good deal to save capture.\" \"So am I,\" answered Jack. \"You are always right. Push ahead, and I\u0027ll follow.\" For three or four hours the boys kept on their way. They surmounted the hill, and found a clearer country. Finally, turning to the right they came upon an open tract. By this time it was growing dark, and the boys were feeling both fatigued and hungry. \"I think we can rest now, Jack,\" said Harry. With a sigh of relief Jack threw himself on the ground. \"This is worse than any work I did on shipboard,\" he said. Harry smiled. \"I don\u0027t think it is likely to cure you of your love for the sea, Jack,\" he said. \"Though I haven\u0027t your fondness for sea life, I confess I would rather be on the deck of a good stanch ship than here.\" \"Harry,\" said Jack anxiously, \"when do you think we shall find something to eat? I am terribly hungry.\" \"So am I, Jack. It\u0027s the hard walk that has increased our appetite.\" \"I have often thought I might be afloat in an open boat without anything to eat, but I never expected to be caught in such a pickle on land.\" \"A good many things have happened to us to-day that we didn\u0027t expect,\" said Harry. \"Do you know, Jack, it seems the longest day I ever spent?\" \"I can say the same.\" \"This morning we set out with Obed, free from care. We have been captured by bushrangers, taken to their camp, seen the murder of their leader, escaped, and after walking for miles through a rough wilderness here we are, tired out and in danger of starvation.\" \"Don\u0027t say any more, Harry,\" said Jack faintly. \"I can realize it without your description.\" \"I wish Obed were with us,\" said Harry, after a pause. \"Perhaps he could think of some way out of our trouble. He is an experienced man, and is used to roughing it. As for me, I feel helpless.\" \"Do you think there is likely to be any house near at hand?\" \"It doesn\u0027t look like it,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"I don\u0027t think I should mind much being caught and carried back by the bushrangers, if they would give me a good supper,\" said Jack ruefully. \"Poor Jack!\" said Harry compassionately; \"I do believe you are suffering for food.\" \"I told you so, Harry.\" \"My appetite no doubt will come later. At present I am not very uncomfortable. Well, Jack, there is only one thing to do. We must explore further and see if we can find any trace of a human habitation. Suppose you go to yonder knoll, and climb the tree at the top. Then use your eyes for all they are worth. They are better than mine, at any rate, for you are accustomed to use them at sea. All sailors, I have heard, are farsighted.\" Jack was ready to obey Harry, feeling much more confidence in his judgment and discretion than in his own. He accordingly followed his advice, and with a sailor\u0027s agility mounted the tree. Then shading his eyes with his hand, he looked earnestly, first in one direction, then in another. \"Well, Jack?\" inquired Harry anxiously, for he, too, appreciated the gravity of their situation. There was a pause; then Jack called out joyfully: \"I see a light: yes, I am sure I see a light.\" \"Whereaway?\" \"Straight ahead, or a little to the left.\" \"Take a good look, Jack, so as to be sure of your bearings. Then we will make our way toward it with the best speed we can muster.\" Jack scrambled down from the tree with his face actually cheerful. The prospect of a meal had put new life into him. \"Follow me!\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think it can be more than a mile away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2978/82091.html","bookId":345,"book":{"id":345,"title":"In A New World or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia","description":"简介： A stout gentleman of middle age and two boys were sitting in the public room of a modest inn in Melbourne.
