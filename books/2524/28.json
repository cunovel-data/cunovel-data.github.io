Beauregard was amused.\\n\\n In the cab on the way back to Whitechapel, she was close beside him. Clayton, engaged for the night, knew where they were going. After his unexpected trip to Limehouse, Beauregard was happy to be driven about London by someone he knew to be in the employ of the Diogenes Club.\\n\\n \u0027Many brilliant men struck their contemporaries as mad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have any contemporaries,\u0027 she said. \u0027Except Vlad Tepes, and I\u0027ve never met him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You follow my reasoning, though?\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve\u0027s eyes flashed. \u0027Of course Charles...\u0027\\n\\n She had the habit of using his Christian name. In another that might be unseemly, but it was absurd to insist on arbitrary rules of address with a woman old enough to be his ten-times great grandmother.\\n\\n \u0027It is possible the murders are experiments,\u0027 she continued. \u0027Dr Knox needed dead bodies, and wasn\u0027t too scrupulous where he got them; Dr Jekyll and Dr Moreau need un-dead bodies, and could quite conceivably not be above harvesting them from the streets of Whitechapel.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Moreau was mixed up in a vivisection scandal a few years ago. Something particularly revolting involving a skinned dog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can believe it. Inside his white coat, he\u0027s a cave-dweller.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And he is a man of some strength. Expert with the bullwhip, they say. He\u0027s knocked about the world a great deal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you don\u0027t think he\u0027s our murderer?\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard was mildly surprised to be so anticipated. \u0027I do not. For one thing, he is reckoned a surgeon of genius.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And Jack the Ripper knows his way about the insides of a body, but trawls through entrails with the finesse of a drunken pork butcher.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\\n\\n He was used to having to explain his reasoning. It was refreshing, if not a little alarming, to be with someone who could keep up with him.\\n\\n \u0027Could he deliberately botch the job to throw off suspicion?\u0027 she asked, then answering herself, \u0027No, if Moreau were stark mad enough to murder for an experiment, he wouldn\u0027t jeopardise his findings with intentional carelessness. If he were our Ripper, he\u0027d abduct the victims and remove them to a private place where he could operate at his leisure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The girls were all killed where they were found.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And swiftly, in a frenzy. No \"scientific method\".\u0027\\n\\n The vampire bit her lip, and was for an instant the image of a serious sixteen-year-old in a dress made for an older and more frivolous sister. Then the ancient mind was back.\\n\\n \u0027So Dr Jekyll is your suspect?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is a biological chemist, not an anatomist. I\u0027m not at all up on the field, but I\u0027ve been wrestling with his articles. He has some odd ideas. \"On the Composition of Vampire Tissue\" was his last piece.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve considered the possibilities. \u0027It\u0027s hard to imagine, though. Next to Moreau, he seems so... so harmless. He reminds me of a clergyman. And he is old. I can\u0027t picture him dashing about the streets by night, much less possessing the sheer strength the Ripper must have.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there\u0027s something there.\u0027\\n\\n She thought a moment. \u0027Yes, you\u0027re right. There is something there. I don\u0027t think Henry Jekyll is Jack the Ripper. But there is an indefinably peculiar quality about him.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard was grimly pleased to have his suspicions confirmed.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll bear watching.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Charles, are you employing me as a bloodhound?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I am. Do you mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Woof woof,\u0027 she said, giggling. When she laughed, her upper lip drew back ferociously from sharp teeth. \u0027Remember not to trust me. I used to say the war would be over by winter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which war?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Hundred Years\u0027 War.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One year, I was right. By then, I didn\u0027t care any more. I think I was in Spain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were French originally. Why don\u0027t you live there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027France was English then. That was what they said the war was about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So you were on our side?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Most definitely not. But it was a long time ago, and in another country, and that girl is long gone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whitechapel is a strange place to find you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not the only French girl in Whitechapel. Half the filles de joie on the streets call themselves \"Fifi La Tour\".\u0027\\n\\n He laughed again.\\n\\n \u0027Your family must have been French too, Monsieur Beauregard, and you reside in Cheyne Walk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was good enough for Carlyle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I met Carlyle once. And many others. The great and the good, the mad and the bad. I used to fear someone would track me down by correlating all the mentions of me in memoirs through the ages. Track me down and destroy me. That used to be the worst that could happen. My friend Carmilla was tracked down and destroyed. She was a soppy girl, fearfully dependent on her warm lovers, but she didn\u0027t deserve to be speared and beheaded, then left to float in a coffin full of her own blood. I suppose I don\u0027t have to worry about that dread dark fate any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What have you been doing all these years?\u0027\\n\\n She shrugged. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Running? Waiting? Trying to do the right thing? Am I a good person, do you think? Or a bad person?\u0027\\n\\n She did not expect an answer. Her mix of melancholy and bitter came out as amusing. He supposed being amusing was her way of coping. She must be as weighted with centuries as Jacob Marley was with chains.\\n\\n \u0027Cheer up, old girl,\u0027 he said. \u0027Henry Jekyll thinks you\u0027re perfect.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old girl?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just an expression.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve hummed sadly. \u0027It\u0027s me exactly, isn\u0027t it though? An old girl.\u0027\\n\\n What was it she made him feel? He was nervous near her, but excited. It was much like being in danger, and he had trained himself to be cool under fire. When he was with Genevieve, it was like sharing a secret. What would Pamela have thought of his vampire? She had been perceptive: even with agony knifing into her, she could not be lied to. To the end, he told her that she would be all right, that she would see home again. Pamela shook away his assurances and demanded he listen. For Pamela, dying was hard: she was angry, not with the fool doctor, but with herself, angry that her body had failed her, was failing their baby. Her fury burned like a fever. Gripping her hand, he could feel it. She died with something unsaid; ever since, he had been picking at the scab, wondering if there was anything to understand, wondering what the urgent thought was, the thought Pamela was not able at the last to force into words.\\n\\n \u0027\"I love you.\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve\u0027s cheeks were dewed with tears. For once, she seemed younger than her face.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what she was saying, Charles. \"I love you.\" That\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n Angered, he gripped the handle of his cane and thumbed the catch. An inch of silver shone. Genevieve gasped.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m so sorry,\u0027 she said, leaning against him. \u0027I\u0027m not like that, really. I don\u0027t pry. It\u0027s...\u0027 She was weeping freely, tears spotting her velvet collar. \u0027It was so clear, Charles,\u0027 she insisted, shaking her head and smiling at the same time. \u0027It came spilling from your mind. Usually, impressions are vague. For once, I had a perfect picture. I knew. What you felt... oh Lord, Charles, I\u0027m so sorry, I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, please forgive me... and what she felt. It was a voice, cutting like a knife. What was her name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pen...\u0027 he swallowed. \u0027Pamela. My wife, Pamela.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pamela. Yes, Pamela. I could hear her voice.\u0027\\n\\n Her cold hands latched upon his, forcing his cane shut. Genevieve\u0027s face was close. Red specks swam in the corners of her eyes.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a medium?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no, no. You\u0027ve carried the moment around with you, nurturing the hurt. It\u0027s in you, there to be read.\u0027\\n\\n He knew she was right. He should have known what Pamela was saying. He had not let himself hear. Beauregard had taken Pamela to India. He knew the risk. He should have sent her home when they found she was with child. But a crisis arose and she insisted on staying. She insisted, but he let her insist; he did not force her back to England. He was weak to let her stay. He did not deserve to understand her at the last. He did not deserve to be loved.\\n\\n Genevieve was smiling through tears. \u0027There was no blame, Charles. She was angry. But not with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never thought...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Charles...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I never consciously thought...\u0027\\n\\n She raised a finger and laid it against his face. Taking it away, she held it up before him. A tear stood out. He took a handkerchief, and wiped his eyes.\\n\\n \u0027I know what she was angry with, Charles. Death. Of all people, I understand. I think I would have liked, would have loved, your wife.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve touched her finger to her tongue, and shuddered slightly. Vampires could drink tears.\\n\\n What Pamela would have thought of Genevieve hardly mattered. What was important, he realised with a gaping in his stomach, was what Penelope would think...\\n\\n \u0027I really didn\u0027t mean for all this to happen,\u0027 she said. \u0027You must think me fearfully wet.\u0027\\n\\n She took his handkerchief, and dabbed her own eyes dry. She looked at the damp-spotted cloth.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 she said. \u0027Salt water.\u0027\\n\\n He was puzzled.\\n\\n \u0027Usually, I cry blood. It\u0027s not very attractive. All teeth and rat-tails, like a proper nosferatu.\u0027\\n\\n Now, he took her hand. The pain of memory was passing; somehow, he was stronger.\\n\\n \u0027Genevieve, you consistently underestimate yourself. Remember, I know for a fact that you don\u0027t know what you look like.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can remember a girl with feet like a duck\u0027s, and lips that don\u0027t match. Pretty eyes, though. I\u0027m not sure, but I hope that was my sister. Her name was Cirielle; she married the brother of a Marshal of France and died a grandmother.\u0027\\n\\n She was sharp again, in control of herself. Only the slight flush on her neck betrayed any emotion, and that was fading like ice in sunlight.\\n\\n \u0027By now my family must have spread over the globe, like Christianity. I expect everybody alive is related to me somehow.\u0027\\n\\n He tried to laugh but she was serious again.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like myself when I gush, Charles. I apologise for having embarrassed you.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard shook his head. Something had broken between them, but he was not sure whether it had been a bond or a barrier. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-28.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \\n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
