{"id":109221,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"DR JEKYLL AND DR MOREAU \u0027My dear Mlle Dieudonne,\u0027 read the note, delivered by the estimable Ned, \u0027I have a call to make in connection with our enquiries, and should like a vampire with me. Could you make yourself available this evening? A cab will be sent to Whitechapel for your use. More later. Beauregard.\u0027 As it eventuated, the cab contained Charles Beauregard himself, freshly shaved and dressed, hat in his lap, cane at his side. He was becoming accustomed to vampire hours, she realised, sleeping by day and thriving by night. He gave the cabby an address across in the city. The hansom shifted pleasantly on its springs as it made its way out of the East End. \u0027Nothing is so reassuring as the interior of a hansom cab,\u0027 Charles declared. \u0027It is a miniature fortress on wheels, a womb of comfort in the dark.\u0027 Considering her companion\u0027s evident inclination towards poetic thought, Genevieve was thankful she had taken care with her attire. She would not pass at the Palace, but her costume was at least not designed to radiate hostility to the male sex. She had bothered with a velvet cape and matching choker. She had spent some extra time brushing her hair, and now wore it loose about her shoulders. Jack Seward told her the arrangement was pleasing, and, denied the vain pleasures of a looking-glass, she would have to take his word. \u0027You seem different this evening?\u0027 Charles noticed. She smiled, trying to keep her teeth from showing. \u0027It\u0027s this dress, I\u0027m afraid. I can hardly breathe.\u0027 \u0027I thought you didn\u0027t need to breathe.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a common fallacy. Somehow, those who know nothing are able to maintain entirely irreconcilable beliefs. On the one hand, vampires can be detected because they do not breathe. On the other, vampires have the rankest breath imaginable.\u0027 \u0027You are right, of course. That had never occurred to me.\u0027 \u0027We are natural beings, like any others,\u0027 she explained. \u0027There\u0027s no magic.\u0027 \u0027What about the business with mirrors?\u0027 That was the thing they always came down to, the business with mirrors. No one had an explanation for that. \u0027Maybe a little magic,\u0027 she said, holding her thumb and forefinger nearly together. \u0027Just a touch.\u0027 Charles smiled, a thing he did rarely. It improved his looks. There was something closed in the back of Charles Beauregard\u0027s mind. She could not truly read thoughts, but she was sensitive. Charles was intent on keeping his mind private. Not a trick that came naturally; his life in the service of the Diogenes Club must have taught it him. Her impression was that this courteous gentleman was an old hand at keeping secrets. \u0027Have you seen the newspapers?\u0027 he asked. \u0027There has been another communique from Jack the Ripper. A postcard.\u0027 \u0027\"Double event this time\",\u0027 she quoted. \u0027Quite. \"Had not time to get ears for police\".\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t he try to sever Cathy\u0027s ear?\u0027 Beauregard had obviously memorised Dr Gordon Brown\u0027s report. \u0027There was some such injury, but it was probably incidental. Her face was extensively mutilated. Even if our letter-writer is not the murderer, he may have an inside source of information.\u0027 \u0027Like whom? A journalist?\u0027 \u0027That is a possibility. The fact that the letters were sent to the Central News Agency, and therefore available to all the newspapers, is unusual. Few outside the press even know what a news agency is. If the letters had been sent to a specific periodical, then individual journalists would benefit from the \"scoop\".\u0027 \u0027And also fall under suspicion?\u0027 \u0027Precisely.\u0027 They were in the city now. Wide, well-lit streets, houses far enough apart to allow for grassy spaces and trees. Everything was so much cleaner here. Although in one square Genevieve noticed three bodies spitted on stakes. Children played hide-and-seek in the bushes around the impaled, red-eyed little vampires seeking out their plump playfellows and giving them affectionate nips with sharpening teeth. \u0027Upon whom are we calling?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Someone of whom you will approve. Dr Henry Jekyll.\u0027 \u0027The research scientist? He was at Lulu Sch?n\u0027s inquest.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the fellow. He has no gods but Darwin and Huxley. No magic at all is admitted past his doorstep. And, speaking of Dr Jekyll\u0027s doorstep, I should hope that this is it.\u0027 The cab stopped. Charles climbed out and helped her down. She remembered to gather her dress and steady herself as she was extricated from the hansom. He told the cabby to wait. They were in a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men: map-engravers, architects, Carpathians, shady lawyers, and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort though it was now in darkness except for the fan-light, Charles knocked. An elderly servant opened the door. Charles presented his card, which Genevieve gathered was a free pass to every dwelling or institution in the country. \u0027And this is Miss Dieudonne,\u0027 Charles explained, \u0027the elder.\u0027 The servant took note, and admitted the visitors into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with flags, warmed after the fashion of a country house by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \u0027Dr Jekyll is in his laboratory with the other gentleman, sir,\u0027 the servant said. \u0027I shall announce you.\u0027 He vanished into another part of the house, leaving Genevieve and Charles in the hall. In the dark, she could see more clearly. There were strange shapes in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the ceiling. \u0027Dr Jekyll obviously doesn\u0027t believe in the incandescent lamp,\u0027 she commented. \u0027It\u0027s an old house.\u0027 \u0027I expected a man of science to live among the shining apparatus of the future, not lurk in the dark of the past.\u0027 Charles shrugged, and leaned on his cane. The servant returned, and led them to the back of the house. They passed through a covered courtyard, and came to a well-lit building which abutted Jekyll\u0027s house back-to-back. A red-baize door hung open and voices came from within. Charles stood aside, and let her enter. The laboratory was a high-ceilinged space like an operating theatre, its walls covered with bookshelves and charts, tables and benches set up all around with intricate arrangements of retorts, tubes and burners. The place smelled strongly of soap, but other scents were not quite obliterated by regular scrubbing-down. \u0027Poole, thank you,\u0027 said Jekyll, dismissing his servant, who retreated to the main house with what Genevieve fancied was relief. The master had been in conversation with a broad-shouldered, prematurely white-haired man. \u0027Mr Beauregard, welcome,\u0027 Jekyll said. \u0027And Miss Dieudonne.\u0027 He bowed slightly and wiped his hands on his leather apron, leaving smears of some substance. \u0027This is my colleague, Dr Moreau.\u0027 The white-haired man raised a hand in greeting. Genevieve\u0027s impression was that she would not care for Dr Moreau. \u0027We have been talking of blood.\u0027 \u0027A subject of much interest,\u0027 Charles ventured. \u0027Indeed. Of paramount interest. Moreau has radical notions on the classification of blood.\u0027 The two scientists had been standing by a bench upon which was unrolled a length of oilcoth. Spread on the cloth was an arrangement of dust and bone fragments roughly in the shape of a man: a curved piece that might have been a forehead, some yellow teeth, a few staves that suggested ribs, and a great quantity of crumbly red-grey matter which she regretted that she had cause to recognise. \u0027This was a vampire,\u0027 she said. \u0027An elder?\u0027 A new-born would not decay so completely. Chandagnac had turned to ashes like these. He had been over four hundred at the time of his destruction. \u0027We were lucky,\u0027 Jekyll explained. \u0027Count Vardalek committed an offence against the Prince Consort and was executed. As soon as I had word of the case, I made an application for his remains. The opportunity has proved invaluable.\u0027 \u0027Vardalek?\u0027 Jekyll waved away the name. \u0027A Carpathian, I believe.\u0027 \u0027I knew him.\u0027 Jekyll, for a moment, was jarred out of his scientific enthusiasm. \u0027I am profoundly sorry, you must forgive me my lack of tact...\u0027 \u0027It is perfectly all right,\u0027 she said, imagining the Hungarian\u0027s painted face stretched over the skull remnants. \u0027We were not intimates.\u0027 \u0027We must study vampire physiology,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027There are numerous points of interest.\u0027 Charles was looking around the laboratory, peering casually at experiments in process. Sludge dripped into a beaker in front of his face, and fizzed into purple foam. \u0027You see,\u0027 Jekyll said to Moreau. \u0027The precipitate reacts normally.\u0027 The white-haired scientist made no reply. Evidently, a point had been scored against him. \u0027Our concerns,\u0027 Charles began, \u0027are not so much scientific as criminal. We have been following the Whitechapel murders. The Jack the Ripper affair.\u0027 Jekyll gave nothing away. \u0027You have yourself taken an interest? Attended inquests, and so forth?\u0027 Jekyll conceded that he had, but volunteered no more. \u0027Have you formed conclusions?\u0027 \u0027About the murderer? Very few. It is my contention that we are all of us, if freed from the restraints of civilised behaviour, capable of any extreme.\u0027 \u0027Man is inherently a brute,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027It is his secret strength.\u0027 Moreau made hairy fists. It occurred to Genevieve that the scientist was physically enormously strong. There was something almost of the ape about his physique. It would be nothing to him to cut a throat or perform a swift dissection, dragging a silver blade through resisting meat, sawing apart bones. \u0027My concern,\u0027 Jekyll continued, \u0027is with the victims. The new-borns. Most of them are dying, you know.\u0027 Genevieve did. \u0027Vampires are potentially immortal. But they are fragile immortals. Something inside drives them to self-destruction.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s the shape-shifters,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027They are evolution run backwards, an atavism. Mankind stands atop of the parabola of life on earth; the vampire represents the step over the prow, the first footfall on the path of regression to savagery.\u0027 \u0027Dr Moreau,\u0027 she said, \u0027if I understand you, I might be offended.\u0027 Jekyll cut in, \u0027ah, but Miss Dieudonne, you should not be. You are the most interesting case imaginable. By your continued existence, you demonstrate that vampires need not be retrograde steps on the evolutionary ladder. I should like to examine you properly. It is conceivable that you could be humanity perfected.\u0027 \u0027I do not feel like anyone\u0027s ideal.\u0027 \u0027Nor will you until you have a perfect world about you. If we could determine the factors that differentiate an elder from a new-born, we might eliminate much wastage of life.\u0027 \u0027New-borns are like young turtles,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027Hundreds hatch, but only a few crawl from sand to sea without being picked off by sea-birds.\u0027 Charles was listening intently, allowing her to quiz the scientists. She wished she knew what he wanted to learn from them. \u0027Without wanting to contradict the pleasing suggestion that I might be the culmination of a divine scheme, surely general scientific opinion is that vampires do not constitute a separate species of humanity but rather are a parasitical outgrowth of our family tree, existing only by virtue of sustenance stolen from our warm cousins?\u0027 Jekyll looked almost angry beneath his mildness. \u0027I find it disappointing that you entertain such outdated notions.\u0027 \u0027I merely entertain them, doctor. I should not ask them to move into my house.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s just drawing an argument out of you, Harry,\u0027 Moreau explained. \u0027Of course, forgive me. To answer simply: vampires are no more parasites for feeding off the blood of human beings than human beings are parasites for feeding off the flesh of beef cattle.\u0027 Genevieve\u0027s red thirst tickled the back of her throat. She had slept the last few days away, and must feed soon or grow weak. \u0027Some of us call you \"cattle\". This dusty gentleman here was known to employ the term.\u0027 \u0027It is understandable.\u0027 \u0027Vardalek was an arrogant Carpathian swine, doctor. I assure you I hold the warm in no such contempt.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad to hear it,\u0027 put in Charles. \u0027Neither of you have chosen to seek the Dark Kiss?\u0027 she said. \u0027Surely, in the name of research, that would be a logical step.\u0027 Jekyll shook his head. \u0027We wish to study the phenomenon at greater length. The vampire condition may be a cure for death, but in nine out of ten cases it is also a deadly poison.\u0027 \u0027Considering the vital import of the field, it has been shockingly neglected,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027Dom Augustin Calmet is still cited as the standard reference...\u0027 Calmet was the author of A Treatise on the Vampires of Hungary and the Surrounding Regions, first published in 1746, a collection of half-confirmed incidents and roughly embroidered folk tales. \u0027Even the late and ill-remembered Professor Van Helsing was at bottom a follower of Calmet,\u0027 Jekyll said. \u0027You gentlemen wish to be the Galileo and Newton of the study of vampirism?\u0027 \u0027Reputation is not important,\u0027 Moreau said. \u0027Any buffoon can buy one. Look at the Royal Society, and recognise them, warm or un-dead, for a pack of bald-pate baboons. In science, proof is vital. And soon we shall have proof.\u0027 \u0027Proof of what?\u0027 \u0027Of the human potential for perfection, Miss Dieudonne,\u0027 said Jekyll. \u0027You are well-named. You might indeed be God-given. If we could all be as you...\u0027 \u0027If we were all vampires, upon whom would vampires feed?\u0027 \u0027Why, we would import Africans or South Sea Islanders,\u0027 Moreau said, as if pointing out to a dunderhead that the sky was blue. \u0027Or raise lesser beasts to human form. If vampires can shift their shapes, so can other creatures.\u0027 \u0027There are African vampires, Dr Moreau. Prince Mamuwalde is much respected. Even in the South Seas, I have kin and kind...\u0027 Genevieve saw an unhealthy light behind Jekyll\u0027s eyes. Its twin could be observed in the eager look of Moreau: the lust of Prometheus, the desire for a consuming flame of knowledge. \u0027What a cold, dark, silence perfection would be,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027I imagine an ultimate universal improvement would be something very like death.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-27.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
