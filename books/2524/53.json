Beauregard understood that since her turning, the celebrated authoress\u0027s prose had further deteriorated. Vampires were rarely creative, all energies diverted into the simple prolonging of life.\n \u0027Where is Mademoiselle Dieudonne?\u0027\n \u0027She is filling in for the director, sir. She should be in Dr Seward\u0027s office. Shall you be wanting to be announced?\u0027\n \u0027No need to bother, thank you.\u0027\n The matron frowned and mentally added another complaint to a list she was keeping of Things Wrong With That Vampire Girl. He was briefly surprised to be party to her clear and vinegary thoughts, but swept the passing distraction aside as he made his way to the director\u0027s first floor office. The door was open. Genevieve was not surprised to see him. His heart skipped as he remembered her, close to him, body white, mouth red.\n \u0027Charles,\u0027 she said.\n She stood by Seward\u0027s desk, papers strewn about her. He found himself embarrassed. After what had passed between them, he did not quite know how to act in her presence. Should he kiss her? She was behind the desk, and the embrace would be awkward unless she made room for it. Looking about for a distraction, his attention was drawn to a device in a glass dust-case, an affair of brass boxes with a large trumpet-like attachment.\n \u0027This is an Edison-Bell phonograph, is it not?\u0027\n \u0027Jack uses it for medical notes. He has a passion for tricks and toys.\u0027\n He turned. \u0027Genevieve...\u0027\n She was near now. He had not heard her come out from behind the desk. She kissed him lightly on the lips and he felt her inside him again, a presence in his mind. He was weak in the legs. Loss of blood, he supposed.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Charles,\u0027 she said, smiling. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to bewitch you. The symptoms will recede in a week or two. Believe me, I have experience with your condition.\u0027\n \u0027Nunc scio quid sit Amor,\u0027 he quoted from Virgil. At last I know what Love is like. He could not think along a straight line of reasoning. Butterfly insights fluttered in the back of his mind, never quite caught.\n \u0027Charles, this might be important,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s something Colonel Moran said, about the Ripper.\u0027\n By an effort of will, he concentrated on the pressing matter.\n \u0027Why Whitechapel?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Why not Soho or Hyde Park or anywhere. Vampirism is not limited to this district, nor prostitution. The Ripper hunts here because it is most convenient, because he is here. Somewhere near...\u0027\n He understood at once. His weakness washed away.\n \u0027I\u0027ve just pulled out our records,\u0027 she said, tapping one of the piles on the desk. \u0027The victims were all brought in at one time or another.\u0027\n He remembered Moran\u0027s reasoning.\n \u0027It all comes back to Toynbee Hall by so many routes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Druitt and you work here, Stride was brought here, the killings are in a ring about the address. You say all the dead women were here...\u0027\n \u0027Yes, and in the last year or so. Could Moran have been right? Could it have been Druitt? There have been no more murders.\u0027\n Beauregard shook his head. \u0027It\u0027s not over yet.\u0027\n \u0027If only Jack were here.\u0027\n He made a fist. \u0027We\u0027d have the murderer then.\u0027\n \u0027No, I mean Jack Seward. He treated all the women. He might know if they had something in common.\u0027\n Genevieve\u0027s words sank into his brain and lightning swarmed behind his eyes. Suddenly, he knew...\n \u0027They had Seward in common.\u0027\n \u0027But...\u0027\n \u0027Jack Seward.\u0027\n She shook her head but he could tell she was seeing what he saw, coming quickly to a realisation. Together, their minds raced. He knew her thoughts and she knew his. They both remembered Elizabeth Stride grasping Seward\u0027s ankle. She had been trying to tell them something. She had been reaching out to identify her murderer.\n \u0027A doctor,\u0027 she said. \u0027They\u0027d trust a doctor. That\u0027s how he got close enough to them, even when the scare was in full flood...\u0027\n She was thinking back, a thousand tiny details leaping at her. Many small mysteries were solved. Things Seward had said, had done. Absences, attitudes. All were explained.\n \u0027\"Something is wrong with Dr Seward\", I was told,\u0027 she said. \u0027Damn me for a fool, damn me for not listening, damn me, damn me...\u0027 She made fists against her forehead. \u0027I\u0027m supposed to see into men\u0027s minds and hearts, and I even ignored Arthur Morrison. I\u0027m the worst fool that ever lived.\u0027\n \u0027Are there diaries around here?\u0027 Beauregard asked, trying to draw her out of her fit of self-recrimination. \u0027Private records, notes, anything? These maniacs are often compelled to keep memorabilia.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been through his files. They contain only the usual material.\u0027\n \u0027Locked drawers?\u0027\n \u0027Only the phonograph cabinet. The wax cylinders are delicate and have to be protected from dust.\u0027\n Beauregard took a good hold and wrenched the cover off the contraption. He pulled open the drawer of the stand. Its fragile lock splintered. The cylinders were ranked in tubes, with neatly inked labels.\n \u0027Chapman,\u0027 he read aloud, \u0027Nichols, Sch?n, Stride/Eddowes, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Lucy...\u0027\n Genevieve was by him, delving deeper into the drawer. \u0027And these... Lucy, Van Helsing, Renfield, Lucy\u0027s Tomb.\u0027\n Everyone remembered Van Helsing; Beauregard even knew Renfield was the Prince Consort\u0027s first disciple in London. But...\n \u0027Kelly and Lucy. Who are they? Unknown victims?\u0027\n Genevieve was going again through the papers on the desk. She talked as she sorted. \u0027Lucy, at a guess, was Lucy Westenra, Vlad Tepes\u0027 first English get. Dr Van Helsing destroyed her, and Jack Seward was in with Van Helsing. He was always expecting the Carpathian Guards to come for him. It is almost as if he has been in hiding.\u0027\n Beauregard snapped his fingers. \u0027Art was in that group, too. Lord Godalming. He\u0027ll be able to fill in details. It comes to me now. Lucy Westenra. I met her once, when she was warm, at the Stokers\u0027. She was part of that set.\u0027\n A pretty, silly-ish girl, not unlike a young Florence. All the men mooned around her. Pamela had not liked her, but Penelope, a child then, doted on the girl. He realised that his former fiancee styled her hair like Lucy\u0027s. It made her look less like her cousin.\n \u0027Jack loved her,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027That was what drew him in with the Van Helsing circle. What happened must have driven him out of his wits. I should have realised. He calls her Lucy.\u0027\n \u0027Her?\u0027\n \u0027His vampire mistress. It\u0027s not her real name, but it\u0027s what he calls her.\u0027\n Genevieve was sorting through the extended drawer of a stout filing cabinet, flicking past individual files with a nimble finger.\n \u0027As for Kelly,\u0027 she said, \u0027we have lots of Kellys on our books. But only one who fits Jack\u0027s requirements.\u0027\n She handed him a sheet of paper, the details of a patient\u0027s treatment. Kelly, Mary Jane. 13 Miller\u0027s Court.\n Genevieve\u0027s face was ash-grey.\n \u0027That\u0027s the name,\u0027 she said. \u0027Mary Jane Kelly.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-53.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
