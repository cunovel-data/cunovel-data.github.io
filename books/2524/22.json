{"id":109216,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"GOOD-BYE, LITTLE YELLOW BIRD The director had left her in charge of the night shift, which put Montague Druitt in a black mood. When Genevieve wanted to stay by Lily\u0027s bedside, Druitt harrumphed about the inconvenience, unsubtly indicating she should delegate the general authority if she wished to devote herself to this specific case. In the small downstairs room where the child\u0027s cot was, Genevieve dispensed instructions. Druitt stood at his ease, and affected not to notice the sawing of Lily\u0027s lungs. Long, agonising down-cut rasps came with every exhalation. Amworth, the newly-engaged nurse, fussed around the patient, rearranging the blankets. \u0027I want you or Morrison in the foyer at all times,\u0027 she told him. \u0027The last few nights, there has been a stream of people coming through. I don\u0027t want anyone in who has no business here.\u0027 Druitt\u0027s brow wrinkled. \u0027You perplex me. Surely, we are for all...\u0027 \u0027Of course, Mr Druitt. However there are those who would exploit us. We have medicines, other items of value. Thefts have been heard of. Also, should a tall Chinese gentleman present himself, I would be grateful if you could refuse him admission.\u0027 He did not understand; she hoped he would not be made to. She did not really think the man could keep the hopping creature out when it resumed its persecution of her. The elder was yet another of the problems pressing around her, jostling for solutions. \u0027Very well,\u0027 Druitt said, and left. She noticed his one good coat was trailing strands along the bottom, and was almost through at the elbows. With these people, good clothes were armour. They separated the genteel from the abyss. Montague John Druitt, she thought, had more than a passing acquaintance with the depths. He was polite to Genevieve but something behind his reserve worried her. He had been a schoolmaster, then half-heartedly embarked on a law career, before coming to Toynbee Hall. He had achieved no distinction in any of his chosen professions. His special project was the raising of public subscriptions to fund a Whitechapel Cricket Club. He would run the side, recruiting likely players from the street, instilling in them the values and skills of the game he, not alone of his countrymen, regarded as almost a religion. Lily began coughing up a red-black substance. The new nurse - a vampire with some experience - wiped clean the child\u0027s mouth, and pressed on her chest, trying to get the blockage cleared. \u0027Mrs Amworth? What is it?\u0027 The nurse shook her head. \u0027The bloodline, ma\u0027m,\u0027 she said. \u0027Nothing much we can do about it.\u0027 Lily was dying. One of the warm nurses had given a little blood but it was no use. The animal she had tried to become was taking over, and that animal was dead. Living tissue was transforming inch by inch into leathery dead flesh. \u0027It\u0027s a trick of the mind,\u0027 Amworth said. \u0027Shape-shifting. To become another thing you must be able to imagine that other thing down to the smallest detail. It\u0027s like making a drawing: you have to get every little working thing right. The raw ability is in the bloodline, but the knack doesn\u0027t come easy.\u0027 Genevieve was glad that those of the bloodline of Chandagnac could not shape-shift. Amworth smoothed Lily\u0027s wing like a blanket. Genevieve saw the disproportionate growth as a child\u0027s crayon drawing, bending the wrong way, not fitting together. Lily yelled, a stabbing pain inside her. She had gone blind on the streets, the sun burning out her new-born\u0027s eyes. The dead wing was leeching substance out of the bones of her legs, which crumbled and cracked in their sheaths of muscle. Amworth had put on splints, but that was just a delaying action. \u0027It would be a mercy,\u0027 Amworth said, \u0027to ease her passing.\u0027 Sighing, Genevieve agreed. \u0027We should have a Silver Knife of our own.\u0027 \u0027Silver Knife?\u0027 \u0027Like the murderer, Mrs Amworth.\u0027 \u0027I heard this evening from one of the reporters that he has sent a letter to the newspapers. He wants to be called Jack the Ripper, he says.\u0027 \u0027Jack the Ripper?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Silly name. No one will ever remember it. Silver Knife he was, and Silver Knife he\u0027ll always be.\u0027 Amworth stood up and brushed off the knees of her long apron. The floor in the room was unswept. It was a constant struggle to keep dirt out of the Hall. It had not been meant for a hospital. \u0027There\u0027s nothing more to be done, ma\u0027m. I must see to the others. I think we can save the Chelvedale boy\u0027s eye.\u0027 \u0027You go, I\u0027ll stay with her. Someone has to.\u0027 \u0027Yes ma\u0027m.\u0027 The nurse left and Genevieve took her place, kneeling by the cot. She took Lily\u0027s human hand and gripped tight. There was still un-dead strength in the child\u0027s fingers, and she responded. Genevieve talked to the girl softly, reverting to languages Lily could not possibly understand. Nestling in the back of her skull was a Medieval French mind that broke through sometimes. Trailing around with her true father, she had learned, even in her short lifetime, to attend the dying. Her father, the physician, tried to save men their commanders would as soon have buried half-alive to get out of the way. The battlefield stink was in this room now, flesh gone rotten. She remembered the Latin droning of the priests and wondered whether Lily had any religion. She had not thought to call a pastor to the deathbed. The nearest clergyman must be John Jago and the Christian Crusader would not consent to attend a vampire of any stripe. There was Reverend Samuel Barnett, Rector of St Jude\u0027s and founder-patron of Toynbee Hall, a tireless committee-member and social reformer, agitating for the cleaning-out of the vice dens of the \u0027wicked quarter-mile\u0027. She remembered him spluttering red-faced with fury when preaching against the practice of women stripping to the waist to fight each other. Barnett, even without the unreasoning prejudice of Jago, disapproved of Genevieve and was openly suspicious of her motives for joining the East End Settlement Movement. She did not blame the Warriors of God for their distrust of her. Centuries before Huxley coined the term, she had been an agnostic. When Dr Seward had interviewed her for this position, he had asked: \u0027you\u0027re not Temperance, you\u0027re not Church, what are you?\u0027 \u0027Guilty,\u0027 she had thought. She sang the songs of her long-ago childhood. She did not know if Lily could hear. The waxy red discharge from her ears suggested she might be deaf as well as blind. Still, the sound - maybe the vibrations in the air, or the scent of her breath - soothed the patient. \u0027Toujours gai,\u0027 Genevieve sang, voice breaking, hot bloody tears welling, \u0027toujours gai...\u0027 Lily\u0027s throat swelled up like a toad\u0027s and brackish blood, brown streaks in the scarlet, gulped out of her mouth. Genevieve pressed the swelling down, holding breath still in her nostrils to fend off the taste and smell of death. She pressed urgently, song and memory and prayer babbled together in her mind, leaking out of her mouth. Knowing she would lose, she fought. She had defied death for centuries; now the great darkness took its revenge. How many of Lily had died before their time to compensate for the long life of Genevieve Dieudonne? \u0027Lily, my love,\u0027 she incanted, \u0027my child, Lily, my dearest darling, my Lily, my Lily...\u0027 The child\u0027s boiled eyes burst open. One milky pupil shrunk minutely, reacting to the light. Through the pain, there was something close to a smile. \u0027Ma-ma,\u0027 she said, first and last word. \u0027Mma...\u0027 Rose Mylett or whoever was the child\u0027s human mother, was not here. The sailor or market porter who spent his fourpence to become her father probably didn\u0027t even know she had lived. And the murgatroyd from the West End - whom Genevieve would track down and hurt - was passed on to other pleasures. Only Genevieve was here. Lily shook in a fit. Drops of sweated blood stood out all over her face. \u0027Mma...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s mother, child,\u0027 Genevieve said. She had no children and no get. A virgin when turned, she had never passed on the Dark Kiss. But she was more this child\u0027s mother than warm Rosie, more her parent-in-darkness than the murgatroyd... \u0027It\u0027s mama, Lily. Mama loves you. You\u0027re safe and warm...\u0027 She took Lily from her cot, and hugged her close, hugged her tight. Bones moved inside the girl\u0027s thin chest. Genevieve held Lily\u0027s tiny, fragile head against her bosom. \u0027Here...\u0027 Pulling her chemise apart, Genevieve thumbnail-sliced a thin cut on her breast, wincing as her blood seeped. \u0027Drink, my child, drink...\u0027 Genevieve\u0027s blood, of the pure bloodline of Chandagnac, might heal Lily, might wash out the taint of Dracula\u0027s grave-mould, might make her whole again... Might, might, might. She held Lily\u0027s head to her breast, guiding the girl\u0027s mouth to the wound. It hurt as if her heart were pierced by a silver ice needle. To love was to hurt. Her blood, bright scarlet, was on Lily\u0027s lips. \u0027I love you, little yellow bird...\u0027 Genevieve sang. In the back of her throat, Lily made a throttling sound. \u0027Goodbye, little yellow bird, I\u0027d rather brave the cold...\u0027 Lily\u0027s head fell away from Genevieve\u0027s breast. Her face was smeared with blood. \u0027... on a leafless tree...\u0027 The child\u0027s wing flapped once, a convulsive jerking-out that unbalanced Genevieve. \u0027... than a prisoner be...\u0027 She could see the gaslight glowing like a blue moon through the thin membrane of the wing, outlining a tracery of disconnected veins. \u0027... in a cage... of... gold.\u0027 Lily was dead. With a spasm of heart-sickness, Genevieve dropped the bundled corpse on the cot and howled. Her front was soaked with her own useless blood. Her damp hair was stuck to her face, her eyes gummed with clotted blood-tears. She wished she did believe in God, so she could curse Him. Suddenly cold, she stood away. She rubbed the obstruction from her eyes and wiped back her hair. There was a basin of water on a stand. She washed her face clean, looking at the clean grain of the wooden frame which had once held a looking-glass. Turning from the basin, she realised there were people in the room. She must have made enough commotion to excite considerable alarm. Arthur Morrison stood by the open door with Amworth behind him. There were others outside in the hall. People from outside, from the streets, nosferatu and warm alike. Morrison\u0027s face was dumbstruck. She knew she must be hideous. In anger, her face changed. \u0027We thought you should know, Genevieve,\u0027 Morrison said. \u0027There\u0027s been another murder. Another new-born.\u0027 \u0027In Dutfield\u0027s Yard,\u0027 said someone with the hot news, \u0027off Berner Street.\u0027 \u0027Lizzie Stride, \u0027er as only turned last week.
