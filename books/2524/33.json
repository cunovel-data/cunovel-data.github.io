Compared to Bloody Sunday it had been a minor skirmish. Godalming, dragged along by Sir Charles, could scarcely tell there had been a riot in St James\u0027s Park. Inspector Mackenzie, a dour Scot, was with them, trying to keep out of the Commissioner\u0027s way. During the hour of excitement just after nightfall, Sir Charles had been a changed person. The ground-down, persecuted bureaucrat whose foolish subordinates could not catch Jack the Ripper disappeared; he was again the military commander with lightning judgement under fire. \u0027These are Englishmen and women,\u0027 Mackenzie had muttered, \u0027not bloody Hottentots.\u0027\n It appeared the Christian Crusade had held an unannounced rally, intending to present a petition to Parliament. They demanded that the taking of another\u0027s blood without consent be considered a capital crime. Sundry vampires mixed in with the crusaders, and violence was exchanged. An unknown person had taken a shot at John Jago, who was now recuperating in a prison hospital. Several well-connected new-borns alleged that they had been assaulted by warm mobs, and a murgatroyd named Lioncourt was put out because a broken flagpole had been shoved through his best suit.\n General Iorga, a commander of the Carpathian Guard, had been caught in the fighting. Now he stood with Sir Charles and Godalming, surveying the aftermath. Iorga was an elder, swanning about in his cuirass and long black cloak as if he owned the earth on which he walked. He was attended by Rupert of Hentzau, a young-seeming Ruritanian blood who thought a good deal of his gold-braided uniform and seemed as skilled at toadying as he was reputed to be with his rapier.\n Sir Charles smiled grimly to himself as he handed out compliments to the men he thought of as his troops.\n \u0027We have won a significant victory here,\u0027 he told Godalming and Iorga. \u0027With no loss of life, we have routed the enemy.\u0027\n It had all blown up and dissipated so suddenly there had been no opportunity for the incident to develop. Iorga had ridden around doing damage but Hentzau and his comrades had not arrived on the scene in time to turn a scuffle into a massacre.\n \u0027The ringleaders must be found and impaled,\u0027 Iorga said. \u0027And their families.\u0027\n \u0027That isn\u0027t how we do things in England,\u0027 Sir Charles said, without thinking.\n The Carpathian\u0027s eyes blazed with hypnotic fury. According to General Iorga, this was no longer England, this was some Balkan pocket kingdom.\n \u0027Jago will be charged with unlawful assembly and sedition,\u0027 Sir Charles said. \u0027And his thugs will find themselves breaking rocks on Dartmoor for some years.\u0027\n \u0027Jago should get Devil\u0027s Dyke,\u0027 Godalming put in.\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n Devil\u0027s Dyke was partially Sir Charles\u0027s invention, an adaptation of a system devised for making use of native prisoners-of-war, for concentrating civilian populations to prevent them from giving succour to their soldiery. Godalming understood the conditions in the camps made what was usually understood by penal servitude seem a breeze on the Brighton promenade.\n \u0027What about the fellow who started it?\u0027 asked Mackenzie.\n \u0027Jago? I\u0027ve just said.\u0027\n \u0027No, sir. I mean the bloody fool with the pistol.\u0027\n \u0027Give him a medal,\u0027 Hentzau said, \u0027then cut off his ears as punishment for bad marksmanship.\u0027\n \u0027He must be found, of course,\u0027 Sir Charles said. \u0027We can\u0027t have Christian martyrs hanging around our necks.\u0027\n \u0027Our honour has been challenged,\u0027 said Iorga. \u0027We must exact reprisals.\u0027\n Even Sir Charles was less a hothead than the General. Godalming was surprised by the elder\u0027s dimwittedness. Long life did not mean a continual growth of intelligence. He understood why Ruthven spoke of the Prince Consort\u0027s entourage in such contemptuous terms. Iorga was tubby around the middle and his face was painted. Once, for a moment only, Godalming had seen the rage-filled face of the Prince himself. Ever since, he had held the Carpathians in undue reverence, imposing the ferocity and stature of their leader on to the image of each of them. That was ridiculous. No matter how brutes like Iorga or blades like Hentzau might try to imitate Dracula, they were never more than feeble copies of the great original, essentially as trifling as the floppiest murgatroyd in Soho.\n He pardoned himself and left the Commissioner and the General to continue mopping-up. Both intended to stand around giving Mackenzie contradictory orders. As he passed Buckingham Palace, he tipped his hat to the Carpathians at the gates. The flag flew, indicating that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness were in residence. Godalming wondered if the Prince Consort ever thought of Lucy Westenra.\n At the Victoria Station boundary of the park were several horse-drawn wagons, penned full of sorry-looking crusaders. Godalming understood that as riots went, tonight\u0027s affair had been strictly third-class.\n He whistled, red thirst pricking the back of his throat. It was good to be young, rich and a vampire. All London was his, more than it was Dracula\u0027s or Ruthven\u0027s. They might be elders, but as he was realising, that actually put them at a disadvantage. No matter how they tried, they could not be of the age. They were historical characters and he was contemporary.\n When he first turned, he had been in a continual funk. He thought the Prince Consort would come for him any night, and serve him as he had served Van Helsing or Jonathan Harker. But he now had to assume he was forgiven. He might have destroyed Lucy Westenra, but Dracula had more important warm wenches to pursue. It was not inconceivable that he was grateful to Godalming for disposing of the get of his first dalliance in England. He would presumably not have wanted an un-dead Lucy for a bridesmaid, looking red daggers at the radiant Victoria as she was led down the aisle of Westminster Abbey by her devoted Prime Minister. That wedding had been the culmination of last year\u0027s Jubilee celebrations. The union of the Widow of Windsor and the Prince of Wallachia bound together a nation which, shaking as it changed, could as easily have flown apart.\n He was expected at Downing Street at two o\u0027clock tomorrow morning. Business was conducted through the night now. Then, before dawn, he was to attend a reception at the Cafe Royal, as Lady Adeline Ducayne welcomed a distinguished visitor, the Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Lady Adeline was taking such care to cosy up to the Countess because the Bathorys were distantly connections of the Draculas. Ruthven described the Countess Elizabeth as \u0027an elegantly revolting alley-cat\u0027 and Lady Adeline as \u0027a wizened skeleton one generation out of the swamp\u0027, but he insisted Godalming be present at the affair in case matters of importance were discussed.\n For the next six hours, he was at liberty. His red thirst grew. It was good to let the need gather, for it gave an edge to feeding. After a brief return to his town house in Cadogan Square to change into evening clothes, Godalming would go out on the razzle. He understood the pleasures of the hunt. He had several possibles picked out and would make one of those ladies his prey this evening.\n His fangs were sharp against his lower lip. The prospect of the chase excited familiar changes in his body. His tastes were sharper, his palate more varied. His swollen teeth malformed his whistling. \u0027Barbara Allen\u0027 became a queer new tune no one would recognise.\n In Cadogan Square, a woman approached him. She had two little girls with her, on leads like dogs. They smelled of warm blood.\n \u0027Kind sir,\u0027 the woman said, hand out, \u0027would you care...\u0027\n Godalming was disgusted that anyone would stoop to selling the blood of their own children. He had seen the woman before, cadging coins off inexperienced new-borns, offering up the scabby throats of her smelly ragamuffins. It was inconceivable that any vampire past his first week could be interested in their thin blood.\n \u0027Go away, or I shall summon a constable.\u0027\n The woman departed, cringing. She dragged her children with her. Both little girls looked back as they were pulled off, hollow eyes round and moist. When they were all used up, would the woman find more children? He thought one of the girls might be new, and considered the possibility that the woman was not their mother but some horrid new species of pimp. He would bring the matter up with Ruthven. The Prime Minister was very perturbed by the exploitation of children.\n He was admitted to his house by the manservant he had brought with him from Ring, the Holmwood country seat. His hat and coat were taken.\n \u0027There\u0027s a lady for you in the drawing room, my lord,\u0027 the valet informed him. \u0027A Miss Churchward. She has been waiting.\u0027\n \u0027Penny? What on earth could she want?\u0027\n \u0027She didn\u0027t say, my lord.\u0027\n \u0027Very well. Thank you. I shall attend to her.\u0027\n He left the man in the hall and entered the drawing room. Penelope Churchward was perched primly on a stiff-backed chair. She had taken a piece of fruit - a dusty old apple, since he only kept food for his infrequent warm guests - and was flaying it with a small paring knife.\n \u0027Penny,\u0027 he said, \u0027what a pleasant surprise.\u0027\n As he spoke, he nicked his lip with a razor-tooth. When the red thirst was upon him, he had to watch his words. She set aside her apple and knife, and arranged herself to address him.\n \u0027Arthur,\u0027 she said, standing up, and extending her arm.\n He carefully kissed her hand. She was different tonight, he knew with an instant intuition. Something in her attitude to him had been budding; now it was in full bloom. The chase had come to him.\n \u0027Arthur, I wish...\u0027\n Her sentence trailed off, but she had made her wish clear. Her collar was open, her throat exposed. He saw the blue vein in her white skin, and imagined it throbbing. A loose strand of her hair hung on her neck.\n Steadily and with considered resolve, she allowed him to embrace her. She moved her head out of his way and he kissed her throat. Usually, his prey moaned as he first bit, gently piercing the skin. Penelope was relaxed and compliant, but made no sound. He clutched her tight to him as blood swelled into his mouth. In the moment of communion, he tasted not only her blood but her head. He understood her measured anger and sensed the rearrangement of the ordered paths of her thinking.\n He gulped, taking more than he should. It was hard to draw away from the fountain. No wonder many new-borns killed their first fancies. Penelope\u0027s blood was of the finest. With no impurities, it slipped down his throat like honeyed liqueur.\n She laid her hand on his cheek and pushed him away. The flow ceased, and he found himself sucking cold air. He would not be stopped. He swept her up in his arms and threw her on to the settee. Growling, he held her down and pulled at her collar. Her chemise tore. He mumbled an apology and fell upon her, his mouth gathering a fold of the flesh of her upper bosom. Her blood thrilled him. His teeth caught in bitemarks, blood seeping around them as he worried at the wound. She did not resist. Blood bubbled into his mouth, and there were violet sunbursts behind his eyes. There was no warm sensation to compare. It was more than food, more than a drug, more than love. Never did he feel more alive than in this moment...\n ... he found himself kneeling by the settee, prostrate on her chest, silently sobbing. Minutes had been burned from his memory. His chin and shirtfront were soaked with blood. Electrical charges coursed through his veins. His heart burned as it filled with Penelope\u0027s blood. For a moment, he was almost insensible. She eased herself into a sitting position and lifted his head. He stared at her with dazed eyes. Angry purple wounds stood out on her neck and breast.\n Penelope smiled a tight, quiet smile at him. \u0027So that is what all the fuss was about,\u0027 she commented.\n She helped him up on to the settee like a mother posing a child for a photograph. He sat, still tasting her in his mouth and head. His shudders subsided. She dabbed her bites clean with a kerchief, wincing in minor irritation. Then she buttoned her jacket up over her ripped chemise. Her hair had come undone, and she fussed with it for a moment.\n \u0027There now, Arthur,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027ve had your satisfaction of me...\u0027\n He could not speak. He was glutted, helpless as a snake digesting a mongoose.\n \u0027... now, I shall complete the exchange and have my satisfaction of you.\u0027\n The paring knife was in her hand, shining.\n \u0027I understand this is quite simple,\u0027 she said. \u0027Be a dear and don\u0027t struggle.\u0027\n Her knife was at his throat, slicing. It was sharp enough to slit his tough skin, but he felt no pain. The knife was not silvered. The gash would heal over almost instantly.\n \u0027Ugh,\u0027 she said.\n Penelope swallowed her distaste and put her tiny mouth over the cut she had made. Shocked, he realised immediately what she was about. Her tongue kept apart the lips of the wound as she sucked blood from him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-33.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
