He was face-down in a pillow, wrists and ankles loosely tied with scarves to brass bedposts. The nice white cotton sheets were spotted and stained.\n Mary Jane was preoccupied with dressing. It was hard to set a bonnet without a mirror.\n \u0027Mary Jane?\u0027\n \u0027Marie Jeanette,\u0027 she corrected, loving the sound like music. She had tried to be rid of her brogue, until she realised men found it pleasing. \u0027I\u0027ve been tellin\u0027 you for close on a year. \u0027Tis Marie Jeanette. Marie Jeanette Kelly.\u0027\n \u0027Yer Kelly don\u0027t go with yer \"Marie Jeanette\", Duchess.\u0027\n \u0027Tish-tush. And pish-posh too.\u0027\n \u0027That bloke what took yer to Paree didn\u0027t do the rest of us no favours.\u0027\n \u0027Any favours.\u0027\n \u0027Pardon me fer suckin\u0027, Duchess.\u0027\n \u0027And don\u0027t you be talkin\u0027 unkindly of my \"Uncle Henry\". He was very distinguished. Probably still is very distinguished.\u0027\n \u0027Unless \u0027e\u0027s a-rottin\u0027 from the pox yer give \u0027im,\u0027 Nell said, without real meanness.\n \u0027Be away with the cheek of you, now.\u0027\n Mary Jane was finally happy with her hat. She was careful about her appearance. She might have turned vampire and she might be a cocotte, but she wasn\u0027t going to let herself go and become a fox-face horror like Nell Coles.\n The other woman sat on the bed, and felt around the poet\u0027s neck, still sticky with his own blood.\n \u0027We done \u0027im, Mary Jane. \u0027E\u0027s bleedin\u0027 dead, an\u0027 \u0027e\u0027ll turn for certain.\u0027\n \u0027Marie Jeanette.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, an\u0027 I\u0027m Contessa Eleanora Francesca Muckety-Muck. Come \u0027ave a butchers.\u0027\n Mary Jane looked Algernon up and down. There were tiny bites, old and new, all over his body. His back and bottom were striped with purple welts. He had provided his own rods and encouraged them to put their backs into the whipping.\n \u0027He\u0027s an old hand at this, Nell. It\u0027d take more than a flogging and a few love-bites to finish off this old cocker.\u0027\n Nell dipped a finger into the blood pooling in the small of Algernon\u0027s back and touched her rough lips. She got hairier with every moonrise. She had to brush her cheeks and forehead now, sweeping her thick red hair back into a flaring mane. She stood out in a crowd, which had been good for business. Customers were peculiar. She wrinkled her wide nose as she tasted the blood. Nell was one of those who got \u0027feelings\u0027 with her food. Mary Jane was glad that didn\u0027t happen to her.\n Nell made a face. \u0027That\u0027s bitter,\u0027 she said. \u0027Who is the cove, anyway?\u0027\n \u0027His friend said he was a poet.\u0027\n A square-rigged gent had sought them out, and paid for a carriage from Whitechapel to Putney. The house was almost in the country. Mary Jane understood Algernon had been sick and was taking the air for his health.\n \u0027Got enough books, ain\u0027t \u0027e?\u0027\n Nell couldn\u0027t read or write, but Mary Jane had her letters. The small bedroom was lined with bookshelves.\n \u0027Did \u0027e write \u0027em all?\u0027\n Mary Jane took a beautifully bound book down from a shelf, and let it fall open.\n \u0027\"Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath,\"\u0027 she read aloud. \u0027\"We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.\"\u0027\n \u0027Sounds lovely. Yer reckon it\u0027s about us?\u0027\n \u0027Doubt it. I think \u0027tis about Our Lord Jesus.\u0027\n Nell made a face. She cringed if someone showed her a crucifix, and couldn\u0027t bear to hear the name of Christ. Mary Jane still went to church when she could. She had been told God was forgiving. After all, the Lord returned from the grave and encouraged folk to drink His blood. Just like Miss Lucy.\n Mary Jane put the book back. Algernon started gulping and Mary Jane held his head up. There was something in his throat. She burped him like a baby and let his head drop. A reddish stain seeped into his pillow.\n \u0027Come down and relieve us from virtue, Our Lady of Pain,\u0027 he said, clearly. Then he slumped insensible again, and started snoring.\n \u0027Don\u0027t sound dead, does he?\u0027\n Nell laughed. \u0027Garn, yer Irish cow.\u0027\n \u0027Silver and stake my heart will break, but names\u0027ll never hurt me.\u0027\n The other woman fastened her chemise over furry breasts.\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t all that hair tickle?\u0027\n \u0027Never \u0027ad any complaints.\u0027\n The poet had just wanted a whipping. When his back was bloody, he had let them bite him. It had been enough to finish him off. After that he had been as harmless as a baby.\n Since she turned, Mary Jane had been opening her legs less. Some men wanted the old-fashioned mixed in, but a lot only liked to be bitten and bled. She remembered with a thrill of nasty pleasure what it had been like when Miss Lucy was at her throat, tiny teeth worrying at the wound. Then the taste of Lucy\u0027s blood, and the fire running through her, turning her.\n \u0027Ladies of Pain, are we?\u0027 Nell said, belting her dress around thick red flanks.\n Mary Jane\u0027s warm life was hazy in her mind. She had been to Paris with Henry Wilcox; that she knew. But she remembered nothing of Ireland, of her brothers and sisters. She knew from what folk who knew her said that she had come to London from Wales, that she had buried a husband, that she had been kept in a house in the West End. Once in a while she would have a glimpse of memory, seeing a face she knew or coming across an old keepsake, but her old life was a chalk picture in the rain, running and blurring. She had been seeing clearly since her turning, as if a dirty window had been wiped clean. Occasionally, when she was full of someone else\u0027s ginny blood, her former self would flood back, and she\u0027d find herself puking in a gutter.\n Nell was bending over Algernon, mouth to a bite on his shoulder, sucking quietly. Mary Jane wondered if the poet\u0027s blood was richer than a normal man\u0027s. Perhaps Nell would start spouting verses and rhymes. That\u0027d be something to hear.\n \u0027Leave him be now,\u0027 Mary Jane said. \u0027He\u0027s had his guinea\u0027s-worth.\u0027\n Nell straightened up, smiling. Her teeth were yellowing, and her gums were black. She\u0027d have to go to Africa and live in the jungle soon.\n \u0027I can\u0027t believe \u0027e\u0027s payin\u0027 a guinea. There ain\u0027t that much tin in the world.\u0027\n \u0027Not in our world, Nell. But he\u0027s bein\u0027 a gentleman.\u0027\n \u0027I knows gentlemen, Mary Jane. They is, as a rule, cheap as week-old pigsblood. And tight as a rat\u0027s arse-hole.\u0027\n They left the room arm in arm and went downstairs. Theodore, Algernon\u0027s friend, was waiting. He must be a good friend, to bring Mary Jane and Nell all the way out to Putney and to stand by all this time. A lot of folk would be disgusted. Of course, Theodore was a new-born and must be broad in the mind.\n \u0027How is Swinburne?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll live,\u0027 she said. Most girls had a fierce sort of contempt for customers like Algernon. They liked to look at a perfectly dressed gent and think of him wriggling naked in pain, sneering at them for preferring a whipping to a good shag. Mary Jane felt different. Maybe her turn had changed the way she felt about what folk did with each other. Sometimes she dreamed of opening the throats of angels as they sang, then straddling them as they died.\n \u0027How he loves you women,\u0027 Theodore said. \u0027He talks about your \"cold immortal hands\". Strange.\u0027\n \u0027He knows what he likes,\u0027 Mary Jane said. \u0027No shame in bein\u0027 partial to something out of the ordinary.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Theodore agreed, unsure. \u0027No shame at all.\u0027\n They stood in the reception room. There were portraits of famous men on the walls and still more books. Mary Jane had a picture of the Champs-Elysees, cut out of an illustrated paper, pasted to the wall of her room in Miller\u0027s Court. She saved up for a frame once when she was warm, but Joe Barnett, her man at the time, found the pennies in a mug and drank them away. He\u0027d blacked her eye for holding back on him. When she turned, she\u0027d thrown Joe out, but not before she had repaid him with interest for the bruises.\n Theodore gave them a guinea apiece and escorted them out to the carriage. Mary Jane tucked her guinea safe into her poke, but Nell had to hold her coin up to catch the moonlight.\n Mary Jane remembered to bid Theodore a good night and to curtsey as Uncle Henry had taught her. Some gentlemen had inquisitive neighbours, and it was only polite to act like a proper lady caller. Theodore didn\u0027t notice and turned back into the house before she had straightened up.\n \u0027A guinea, blimey,\u0027 Nell exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027d \u0027a bitten \u0027is balls fer a guinea.\u0027\n \u0027Get in the coach with you, you embarrassin\u0027 tart,\u0027 Mary Jane said. \u0027I don\u0027t know of what you\u0027re thinkin\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027I do believe I will, Duchess,\u0027 she said, squeezing through the door, wiggling her rump from side to side.\n Mary Jane followed and settled down.\n \u0027Oi you,\u0027 Nell shouted to the driver, \u0027\u0027ome, an\u0027 don\u0027t spare the \u0027orses.\u0027\n The carriage lurched into motion. Nell was still playing with her gold coin. She had tried to bite it. Now she was shining it against her shawl.\n \u0027I\u0027ll be off the streets fer a month,\u0027 she said, licking her fangs. \u0027I\u0027ll go up West an\u0027 find myself a guardsman with a knob like a firehose, an\u0027 suck the bastard dry.\u0027\n \u0027But you\u0027ll be back in the alleys when the money\u0027s gone, on your back in the muck while some drunkard wobbles all over you.\u0027\n Nell shrugged. \u0027I \u0027ardly think I\u0027ll be marryin\u0027 royalty. Yer neither, Marie Jeanette de Kelly.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not on the streets any more.\u0027\n \u0027Just \u0027cos there\u0027s a roof over the bed yer shag in don\u0027t make it a church, girl.\u0027\n \u0027No strangers, that\u0027s my rule now. Just familiar gentlemen.\u0027\n \u0027Very familiar.\u0027\n \u0027You should be listenin\u0027 to me, you know. It\u0027s not healthy on the streets these nights. Not with the Ripper.\u0027\n Nell was unimpressed. \u0027In Whitechapel, \u0027e\u0027d \u0027ave to kill an \u0027ore a night til kingdom come til \u0027e got to me. There\u0027s thousands of us, an\u0027 there will be long after \u0027e\u0027s rottin\u0027 in Hell.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s killin\u0027 them two at a time.\u0027\n \u0027Garn!\u0027\n \u0027You know \u0027tis true, Nell. \u0027Tis over a week since he did for Cathy Eddowes and the Stride woman. He\u0027ll be out and about again.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like to see \u0027im try anythin\u0027 with me,\u0027 Nell said. She snarled, a mouthful of wolf-teeth glistening. \u0027I\u0027d rip \u0027is \u0027eart out, an\u0027 eat the blighter.\u0027\n Mary Jane had to laugh. But she was being serious. \u0027The only safe thing is familiar gentlemen, Nell. Customers you know, and are sure of. The best thing would be to find a gentleman to keep you. Especially if he wants to keep you outside Whitechapel.\u0027\n \u0027Only place that\u0027d keep me is the zoo.\u0027\n Mary Jane had been kept once. In Paris, by Henry Wilcox. He was a banker, a colossus of finance. He had gone abroad without his wife, and Mary Jane had travelled with him. He told everyone she was his niece, but the French understood the arrangement all too well. When he travelled on to Switzerland, he left her behind with an old frog rakehell to whom she did not take. \u0027Uncle Henry\u0027, it turned out, had lost her on a hand of cards. Paris had been lovely but she still came back to London, where she knew what folk were saying and she was the only person gambling with her life.\n It was almost dawn when they got to Whitechapel. She\u0027d not known enough at first to stay out of the sun, and her skin had burned to painful crackling. She had ripped dogs open for their juice. It had taken her months to catch up with the other new-borns.\n She gave directions to the warm driver, realising with a nice hot surge that the man was petrified of his vampire passengers. She rented a room just off Dorset Street, from McCarthy the chandler for four and six a week. Some of the guinea would have to pay the arrears and keep McCarthy off her back. But the rest would be for her. Perhaps she could find a picture-framer?\n Once they were out of the coach, it trundled off quickly, leaving them on the pavement. Nell gestured after the departing driver and howled like a comical animal. She even had fur growing around her eyes and up behind her pointed ears.\n \u0027Marie Jeanette,\u0027 croaked a voice from the shadows. Someone was standing under the Miller\u0027s Court archway. A gentleman, by his clothes.\n She smiled, recognising the voice. Dr Seward stepped out of the dark.\n \u0027I\u0027ve been waiting most of the night for you,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027d like...\u0027\n \u0027She knows what yer\u0027d like,\u0027 Nell said, \u0027an\u0027 yer orter be shamed of yerself.\u0027\n \u0027Shush, furface,\u0027 she said. \u0027That\u0027s no way to be talkin\u0027 to a gentleman.\u0027\n Nell stuck her snout in the air, rearranged her shawl, and trotted off, sniffing like a music hall queen. Mary Jane apologised for her.\n \u0027Do you want to come in, Dr Seward?\u0027 she asked. \u0027It\u0027s nearly sunup. I have to have my beauty sleep.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like that very much,\u0027 he said. He was fidgeting with his neck. She had seen her customers do that before. Once bitten, they always came back for more.\n \u0027Well, follow me.\u0027\n She led him to her room and let him in. Early sun fell through the dusty window on to the unwrinkled bedspread. She drew the curtains against the light. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-31.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
