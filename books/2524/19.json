{"id":109213,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"THE POSEUR\\n\\n Lord Ruthven stood at a podium, one hand fisted sternly on his extravagantly ruffled breast, the other resting upon an imposing stack of books. The Prime Minister\u0027s Carlyle, Godalming noticed, still had uncut pages. Ruthven wore a midnight black frock coat, frogged at the collar and on the pockets. A curly-brimmed top hat perched on his head; his face was a thoughtful blank. The portrait would be called The Great Man, or some such imposing title. My Lord Ruthven, the Vampire Statesman.\\n\\n Several times Godalming had sat for painters; he had been possessed of a series of sudden, urgent needs to scratch or blink or twitch. Ruthven was uniquely able to stand motionless all afternoon, as patient as a lizard waiting on a rock for a morsel to crawl within range of a darting tongue.\\n\\n \u0027It is a shame we are denied the miracle of photography,\u0027 he declared, lips apparently unmoving. Godalming had seen attempted photographs of vampires. They developed in a blurred manner, the subjects appearing, if at all, as fuzzy silhouettes with corpselike features. The laws that affected mirrors somehow thwarted the photographic process.\\n\\n \u0027But only a painter can capture the inner man,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027Human genius shall always be superior to mechanical-chemical trickery.\u0027\\n\\n The artist at hand was Basil Hallward, the society portraitist. He deftly sketched a series of studies, a preliminary to the full-length picture. Although more fashionable than inspired, Hallward had his moments. Even Whistler doled out a few kind words for his early work.\\n\\n \u0027Godalming, what do you know about the Silver Knife business?\u0027 Ruthven asked, suddenly.\\n\\n \u0027The murders in Whitechapel? Three so far, I believe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good, you\u0027re up on it. Excellent man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just glance at the newspapers.\u0027\\n\\n Hallward released the Prime Minister and Ruthven sprang from his spot, eager to see the sketches, which the painter clutched to his heart.\\n\\n \u0027Come now, just a peep,\u0027 coaxed Ruthven, exerting considerable charm. At times, he was quite the larkish lad.\\n\\n Hallward showed his pad and Ruthven flicked through, uttering approval.\\n\\n \u0027Very fine, Hallward,\u0027 he commented. \u0027I do believe you\u0027ve caught me. Godalming, look here, look at this expression. Is this not me?\u0027\\n\\n Godalming agreed with Ruthven. The Prime Minister was delighted.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re too much the new-born to have forgotten your own face, Godalming,\u0027 Ruthven said, fingers at his own cheek. \u0027When I was as barely-cool as you, I swore it would never happen. Ah, the resolutions of youth. Gone, gone, gone.\u0027\\n\\n From philosophy, Ruthven switched to natural science. \u0027Actually, it is untrue that vampires lack a reflection. It is just that the reflection invariably does not reflect, as it were, what is out here in the world.\u0027\\n\\n Godalming, like every new-born, had stared at a shaving glass for a few hours, wondering. Some disappeared completely, while others saw an apparently empty suit of clothes. Godalming\u0027s image was a black fudge like the photographs Ruthven had mentioned. The matter of mirrors was uniformly considered the most impenetrable of the mysteries of the un-dead.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, Godalming... Silver Knife? This beastly murderer. He preys only on our kind, does he not? Slits throats and stabs hearts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is what they say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A fearless vampire killer, like your old associate Van Helsing?\u0027\\n\\n Godalming\u0027s face burned; if still capable of blushing, he was doing so.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 the Prime Minister said with patent sincerity, \u0027I did not intend to raise that matter. It must be painful for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Things have changed, my lord.\u0027\\n\\n Ruthven fluttered his hand. \u0027You lost your fiancee to this Van Helsing. Having suffered more at his hand than even Prince Dracula, you have been pardoned and forgiven your ignorance.\u0027\\n\\n Godalming remembered hammering at the stake, and Lucy\u0027s hissing, blood-spitting death. A death that need never have been. Lucy would have been one of the first ladies of the court; like Wilhelmina Harker or the Prince Consort\u0027s Carpathian mistresses. He would have lost her anyway.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve cause to curse the Dutchman\u0027s memory. For that reason, I wish you to represent my interests in the matter of Silver Knife.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see what you mean.\u0027\\n\\n Ruthven was back at his podium, exactly in his former pose. Hallward\u0027s quick fingers filled in detail on a large sketch.\\n\\n \u0027The Palace has taken an interest. Our dear Queen is most upset. I have a personal note from Vicky. \"This murderer is certainly not an Englishman,\" she deduces, \"and if he is, he is certainly not a gentleman.\" Very astute.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whitechapel is a notorious nest of foreigners, my lord. The Queen may be right.\u0027\\n\\n Ruthven smiled ironically. \u0027Rot, Godalming. We should all like to believe the English incapable of atrocious conduct, but such is not the case. Sir Francis Varney, after all, is an Englishman. The point is that our murderer is very choosy about his midnight surgical experiments.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think he\u0027s a doctor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s hardly a fresh theory. It\u0027s of no importance. No, the thing is that he is a vampire killer. An homicidal lunatic, almost certainly, but also a vampire killer. Given the delicacy of the situation, he is treading a knife-edge with the public. No matter how they may disapprove and cry \"monster\", there is another view, a view which upholds the Silver Knife as an outlaw hero, a Robin Hood of the gutters.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Surely no Englishman could believe so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you forgotten what it was like to be warm, Godalming? How did you feel when you were following Van Helsing about Kingstead Cemetery with hammer and stake?\u0027\\n\\n Godalming understood.\\n\\n \u0027The best thing would be, and I am not commissioning such an act by any means, if our madman were to take his silver knife to some warm tart, and thus display an all-inclusive mania. If there is any sympathy for him, such a step would cause it to evaporate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But even this exalted office does not give me power over the minds of mad murderers. A pity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What would you have me do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Poke around, Godalming. We are late off the mark. Many interested parties have been tracking our man. Carpathians have been seen attending inquests and loitering in vile places. And a connection of yours, one Charles Beauregard, has been acting on behalf of our more secret services.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Beauregard? He\u0027s a quill-pusher...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is a member of the Diogenes Club, and the Diogenes Club is well-placed.\u0027\\n\\n Finding a tiny fold of lip caught between his teeth, Godalming bit down, swallowing the brief tang of his own blood. It was becoming a habit.\\n\\n \u0027Beauregard has been haring around mysteriously. I have seen something of his fiancee. She is put out by his neglect.\u0027\\n\\n Ruthven laughed. \u0027Ever the curly-haired roue, Godalming?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Godalming said, lying.\\n\\n \u0027At any rate, watch Beauregard. I\u0027ve no reports of him beyond the most basic; which suggests to me that he is a shiny little tool Admiral Messervy and his crew wish to keep all to themselves.\u0027\\n\\n He could not imagine Beauregard even knowing where Whitechapel was. But he had been in India. Godalming had heard odd hints from Penelope, hints that now formed a wavering picture of a man very different from the dull companion of Florence Stoker\u0027s after-darks.\\n\\n \u0027At any rate, we are expecting Sir Charles Warren within the half-hour. I shall breathe fire in his face and impress upon him the importance of bringing this affair to a speedy and happy conclusion. Then I intend to saddle the Commissioner with you.\u0027\\n\\n Godalming was quietly proud. A clever new-born might advance himself by doing such a service to his Prime Minister.\\n\\n \u0027Godalming, this is an opportunity for you to erase forever that question mark by your name. Bring us Silver Knife and it\u0027ll be as if you had never met Abraham Van Helsing. Few have a chance to change their past.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Prime Minister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And remember, our interests are singular. If the murderer is brought to book, then that will be good and just. But the most important aspect of the case is far removed from the fates of a few eviscerated demi-mondaines. When this is finished, the murderer must be reviled not revered.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe I fully understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let me illustrate. In New Mexico, ten years ago, a new-born ran riot, killing without thought. A warm man, Patrick Garrett, loaded a shotgun with sixteen silver dollars and peppered his heart with razor-shards. The new-born was Henry Antrim or William Bonney, a cretin leech who deserved his fate. Soon after, stories began to circulate. Dime novels elaborated upon his youth and romantic appeal. Billy the Kid, they call him now, Billy Blood. Squalid murder and pathetic crime are forgotten and the American West has a a range-riding vampire demi-god. You can read in the penny press how he rescued fair maidens and was rewarded with their freely-bestowed favours, how he stood up for poor farmers against cattle kings, how he only became a killer to avenge the death of his father-in-darkness. It\u0027s all bunkum, Godalming, all a pretty lie for the newspapers. Billy Bonney was so low he\u0027d bleed his own horse, but now he is a true hero. That will not happen in this case. When Silver Knife is hoisted to the stake, I want a dead madman not an unkillable legend.\u0027\\n\\n Godalming understood.\\n\\n \u0027Warren and the others merely wish to finish Silver Knife for 1888. I want you to make sure he is destroyed for all time.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-19.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \\n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
