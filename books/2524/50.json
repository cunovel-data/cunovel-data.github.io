Not that any driver would dare venture into the Old Jago, for fear his brass would be tarnished, his fare stolen and his horse exsanguinated. The last time Godalming had been in Whitechapel, dogging Sir Charles\u0027s heels, he had gathered how teeming the quarter was. It might take weeks of patient work to find his Sergeant but find the man he would. With Mackenzie dead and Kostaki imprisoned, he had no rivals on this track. Only he knew the face of the quarry.\\n\\n As he strolled up Commercial Street, Godalming whistled \u0027The Ghost\u0027s High Noon\u0027, from Ruddigore. Not politically a sound tune for an intimate of Lord Ruthven, it was hard to work out of the head. Besides, when he had unshakable evidence that the Diogenes Club conspired against the Prince Consort, he would be forgiven anything. His long-ago warm association with Van Helsing would be wiped from the record. He could name his own position. Arthur Holmwood was on his way up.\\n\\n His nocturnal vision had improved markedly. The entire quality of his perceptions shifted with each night. The fog that shrouded the people on the street was to him merely a faint fuzziness. He could distinguish an infinite variety of tiny sounds, scents and tastes.\\n\\n Even if Ruthven lived forever, it was unlikely he could keep eternally on the right side of the Prince Consort. He was too temperamental for his position. Eventually, he would fall from grace. When that happened, Godalming would be in a position to dissociate himself from his patron. Perhaps even to replace him.\\n\\n Some time tonight, he must feed. His appetites grew with the increase of his sensitivities. What was once a fumbling business - wrestling some tart before ripping into her with swollen, painful teeth - became easier as he found himself more able to impose his will upon the warm. He merely had to issue mental orders to his chosen conquest and she would come to him, baring her neck for his satisfaction. It was smooth and peculiarly delightful. His approach became delicate and he was able more to relish the pleasures of feeding.\\n\\n It was time he made more vampires, like Penelope Churchward. He would need concubines, catspaws, maidservants. Each powerful elder had his retinue, adoring get who served their master\u0027s interests. For the first time, he wondered what had happened to the new-born Penny. She had stolen a suit of his clothes. He must seek her out and bend her to his purpose.\\n\\n \u0027Art?\u0027 came an educated girl\u0027s voice. \u0027I say, it\u0027s Lord Godalming, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n He looked at the girl and his thoughts crawled down. It was like being dragged from a mountain peak into a muddy trough; forced to consider petty pursuits after having had the prospect of things colossal.\\n\\n \u0027Miss Reed,\u0027 he purred, \u0027how pleasant to find you.\u0027\\n\\n Kate Reed looked at him strangely, almost shocked. He considered feeding off her, but was not ready. Vampire blood was heady. Only true elders could survive a diet of the stuff, exhorting tribute from their vassals. He was not yet strong enough, but Kate might make a suitable vassal in the new century. Doubtless weak, she could be easily shaped into a pliable devotee.\\n\\n The girl looked taken aback; disgust leaked out of her head. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said, \u0027I see I was mistaken.\u0027\\n\\n Since turning, she had changed. Godalming had badly underestimated Kate Reed. She had found him entirely transparent. His thoughts had been written on his face, or so boldly in his head that even a poor new-born could distinguish them. He would have to be more careful. The girl retreated swiftly, almost running. She would not welcome his attentions in the near future. Still, he had time. Eventually, he would claim her. He would make a project of it.\\n\\n He resumed his whistling, but the tune was shrill and erratic to his own ears. With considerable irritation, he realised Kate Reed had rattled him. He was so taken with his new abilities and perceptions that he had neglected the mask that had been a part of him long before he left his warm days behind. He had let another see him as he truly was, which was unforgivable. His father, his human father, would have thrashed him soundly for showing his hand in such a blatant fashion.\\n\\n He wanted to be among people, hidden in a crowd. There was a public house, the Ten Bells, on the other side of the road. He might find a woman there. He crossed the street, dodging out of the path of a cart, and pushed into the pub...\\n\\n ... there were a few warm folks scattered in the crowd, but mostly the Ten Bells was a vampire pub. Godalming resisted the meagre temptations of a pint of pig\u0027s blood, but found company with a pair of new-born whores. To everyone but his quarry, he would seem a slumming murgatroyd from the West End. He wore his frilliest shirt and his tightest jacket, and looked the part of a bloodthirsty, empty-headed poseur.\\n\\n The whores were called Nell and Marie Jeanette; they were lightly sozzled on gin and pig\u0027s blood. Nell was remarkably hirsute with a striking faceload of stiff red bristles. Marie Jeanette was Irish with absurd pretensions and new clothes. Marie Jeanette, who was almost pretty, had an appointment later, presumably with a deep-pocketed admirer. She was just passing the time but Nell was seriously on the prowl and took elaborate care to seem intrigued, often commenting on his general good appearance and obvious sharpness. He did his best to seem a drunken, affected idiot.\\n\\n Nell was outlining a supposedly tempting scheme, involving a warm third party. She was proposing that they get together in her nearby room, and he could have his pleasure of the two of them, satisfying all his interests in one bed. She kept rubbing her whiskered cheek against him, letting him sniff her animal musk.\\n\\n \u0027Yer has to rub me the right way, Artie,\u0027 she said, smoothing the fur on her arm, then ruffling it up. \u0027Depending on what yer likes.\u0027\\n\\n He looked across the pub and saw a man at the bar, back to the room. Godalming, with a rush of excitement, knew. He pressed close to Nell\u0027s neck, making sure his face was in shadow. A pint of pig in his hand, the man turned, one heel up on the bar-rail, and looked about him. It was the Sergeant. He took a deep draught of his drink, then wiped the gory residue out of his moustache with the back of his hand. He was in a check suit not a constable\u0027s uniform, but there was no mistaking him.\\n\\n \u0027That man at the bar,\u0027 he said, \u0027with the extravagant moustache. Do you know him? Don\u0027t be obvious about looking.\u0027\\n\\n If Nell noticed he was suddenly twice as intelligent and half as interested in her, she accepted the change without complaint. She was used to the requirements of her gentleman friends. Like a good little spy, she took a neatly surreptitious look and whispered to him, \u0027He\u0027s a regular. Danny Dravot.\u0027\\n\\n The name meant nothing but hearing it gave him a ticklish thrill in his stomach. His quarry had a face and a name. Dravot was almost in Godalming\u0027s power.\\n\\n \u0027I thought I might have known him in the army,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027He was in India, I hears. Or maybe Afghanistan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A sergeant, I\u0027ll wager.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Some does call him that.\u0027\\n\\n Marie Jeanette was listening to them. She must be feeling left out, awaiting her tardy suitor.\\n\\n \u0027Does yer want me to invite him over,\u0027 Nell asked.\\n\\n Godalming looked at Dravot\u0027s glittering red eyes. Though sharp and clever, they did not seem to notice him.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he told the whore. \u0027He\u0027s not the fellow I thought he was.\u0027\\n\\n Dravot finished his pint and left the Ten Bells. Godalming let him get entirely out and stood up, leaving the two whores cold. They would be puzzled but go on to the next customer. Whores were no threat.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027Ere, where yer goin\u0027?\u0027 Nell protested.\\n\\n He lurched away from the table, pretending to be drunk.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027E\u0027s a rum \u0027un,\u0027 Nell told Marie Jeanette.\\n\\n The doors were pulled open just as he reached them and he slipped out into the street, shoving aside a new-comer. Dravot was briskly marching away, towards the Old Jago. He made as if to follow but a hand was laid on his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Art?\u0027\\n\\n ... of all the people in the Empire, he had run into Jack Seward! The doctor was much changed. Still warm, he seemed ten years older, face weathered, hair streaked grey, colour bad. His clothes had been good once, but were missing a few buttons and none the better for dusty stains.\\n\\n \u0027Good God, Art, what...?\u0027\\n\\n Dravot stopped to talk with a knife-grinder. Godalming thanked providence, and wondered how he might get rid of his unwanted old friend.\\n\\n \u0027You look...\u0027 Unable to complete a sentence, Seward shook his head and grinned. \u0027I don\u0027t know what to say.\u0027\\n\\n Godalming could tell Seward was sick in his head. When last he had seen him - in Purfleet when, as a warm fool, Godalming had dared defy Dracula and wound up fleeing for his life, leaving behind his companions to face the Count - Seward had been nervous but in command of himself. Now he was a broken man. Still ticking but completely broken, like a watch that skips hours and sometimes runs backwards for the odd minute.\\n\\n Dravot was deep in conversation with the knife-grinder. The man must be one of his confederates.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a vampire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Obviously.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like him. Like Lucy.\u0027\\n\\n He remembered Lucy, screeching as he pounded the stake into her. The dreadful grinding of the saw against her neckbone as Van Helsing and Seward removed her garlic-stuffed head. The old anger came back. \u0027No, not like Lucy.\u0027\\n\\n Dravot started walking off again. Godalming stepped around Seward and hesitated. If he broke into a run, the Sergeant would know he was pursued and take steps to evade the huntsman. Coldly ignoring Seward, he began to walk, pretending to amble, but actually moving at a measured pace, fixing Dravot in his eye. The doctor caught up and trotted at his side, giving out little yelps to get his attention like an overly-insistent mendicant. Behind them, someone else had come out of the Ten Bells. She shouted after Seward. It was Marie Jeanette. Seward had certainly changed his habits since Godalming last knew him.\\n\\n \u0027Art, why did you turn? After all he did to us, why...?\u0027\\n\\n Dravot slipped into a side-street. Godalming thought the Sergeant had been alerted by the commotion.\\n\\n \u0027Art, why...?\u0027\\n\\n Seward was near hysteria. Godalming shoved him away, and hissed. He must be rid of this nuisance. The doctor fell back against a lamp-post, appalled and shocked.\\n\\n \u0027Leave me be, Jack.\u0027\\n\\n The doctor shook, old fears returning. Godalming heard the rapid clip of Marie Jeanette\u0027s boots as she ran towards them. Good. The whore would distract Seward. He turned away and followed Dravot. The Sergeant had doubled back away from the Jago, walking around the market towards Aldgate. Damn. It was in the open now. Godalming would have to outpace the new-born and bring him down. He had a revolver loaded with silver. He needed Dravot alive but he was ready to cripple the Sergeant to bring him in. The more he was hurt, the keener he would be to expose his confederates. Dravot was the key. If he could be turned properly, the future was laid out to Godalming\u0027s advantage. He was sure of his own faculties, of his strength. His curved fangs were comfortable in the grooves they had worked inside his mouth. He no longer chewed himself.\\n\\n Through the warren-like maze of streets around the market, Godalming hunted Sergeant Danny Dravot. Even when the quarry got out of his sight, he seemed to leave a glowing trail in the fog. Godalming could hear the distinctive quality of his boot-steps streets away. This could be dangerous. The Sergeant had shown consummate cool in his assassination of Inspector Mackenzie. Remembering Kate Reed, he checked his confidence. He would not be brought low by overestimating his own powers.\\n\\n Cautiously, he followed Dravot. They were past the market now and straggling back towards Commercial Street. Godalming rounded a corner into Dorset Street and could not see the Sergeant. Off this road was a series of tiny residential courts. The fox must have slipped into one of them. The fog eddied by an arched opening. Godalming was sure he had his man cornered. The only other egress from the court would be through one of the dwellings.\\n\\n Whistling again, light-headed with incipient victory, he strolled towards the court. His step was nimble and he was ready for a great test of his strength. First, he would batter the new-born with his fists, pulling out the revolver only to settle the matter at the end. It was important that he prove his dominance over the lesser vampire.\\n\\n A couple appeared at the end of Dorset Street, moving towards him. It was Seward and his whore. They did not matter. It would be useful to have witnesses to this business. Jack Seward would serve the cause of Arthur Holmwood after all.\\n\\n \u0027Jack,\u0027 he said, \u0027I have a criminal trapped. Stay by this court and summon a constable if one happens to pass.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A criminal,\u0027 exclaimed Marie Jeanette. \u0027Faith, in Miller\u0027s Court?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A desperate man,\u0027 he told them. \u0027I am an agent of the Prime Minister, on urgent official business.\u0027\\n\\n Seward\u0027s face was dark. Marie Jeanette could not keep up with the developments.\\n\\n \u0027I live in Miller\u0027s Court,\u0027 the whore said.\\n\\n \u0027Who is the man?\u0027 Seward asked.\\n\\n Godalming was peering into the fog. He thought he could see the Sergeant, standing in the courtyard, awaiting him.\\n\\n \u0027What has he done?\u0027\\n\\n Godalming knew what would most impress these fools. \u0027He\u0027s the Ripper.\u0027\\n\\n Marie Jeanette gasped and held her hand to her mouth. Seward looked as if he had been stomach-punched.\\n\\n \u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said, a hand inside his coat, \u0027stand back.\u0027\\n\\n A chink appeared in Godalming\u0027s confidence. Dravot dared him to enter Miller\u0027s Court. Seward and Marie Jeanette were pestering fleas and should be brushed off. He had a destiny to fulfil. But something tiny was wrong.\\n\\n \u0027You called her Lucy,\u0027 he said. \u0027Her name isn\u0027t Lucy.\u0027\\n\\n He turned to Seward, who pressed close against him, arm moving fast. Godalming felt a silver shock in his chest. Something sharp was stuck into him, sliding swiftly and smoothly between his ribs.\\n\\n \u0027And that man in there,\u0027 Seward said, nodding into the courtyard...\\n\\n Great pain spread through Godalming\u0027s chest. He was packed in ice, but a white-hot needle transfixed him. His vision blurred, his hearing was a fuzzy jangle, all senses were stripped from him.\\n\\n \u0027... his name isn\u0027t Jack.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-50.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \\n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
