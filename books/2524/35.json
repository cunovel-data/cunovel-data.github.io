It is good, no?\u0027\n Von Klatka was enjoying himself too much. The Carpathian Guard had been called into the park too late to do much more than gloat. It was the best kind of victory, Kostaki reflected, with spoils but no losses. The police had already rounded up and penned most of the trouble-makers.\n A row of worried faces peered through the bar-like slats of the nearest wagon. It held the women. Most wore white vestments with red crosses on the front.\n \u0027Christian Crusaders!\u0027 von Klatka sneered, \u0027fools!\u0027\n \u0027We were the Christians once,\u0027 Kostaki said. \u0027When we followed Prince Dracula against the Turk.\u0027\n \u0027An old battle, my comrade. There are new enemies to be conquered.\u0027\n He approached the wagon. The prisoners whimpered, cringing away from the slats. Von Klatka grinned and snarled. Some woman stifled screams and von Klatka laughed. Was there honour in this?\n Kostaki saw a familiar face among the milling policemen.\n \u0027Scotsman,\u0027 he shouted, \u0027hail and well met.\u0027\n Inspector Mackenzie turned from his conversation with a turnkey and saw Kostaki bearing down on him. \u0027Captain Kostaki,\u0027 Mackenzie acknowledged, tapping the brim of his hat. \u0027You\u0027ve missed the merriment.\u0027\n Von Klatka prodded between the bars of the wagon, a naughty child in the zoo. One of the prisoners fainted and her comrades called for God or John Jago to protect them.\n \u0027Merriment?\u0027\n Mackenzie snorted bitterly. \u0027You might think it so. Not enough blood spilled for your tastes, I imagine. No one killed.\u0027\n \u0027I am sure the omission will be remedied. There must be ringleaders.\u0027\n \u0027Examples will be made, Captain.\u0027\n Kostaki sensed the warm policeman\u0027s discomfort, his swallowed anger. Few alliances truly lasted. It must be difficult for this man to reconcile his duties with his loyalties. \u0027I respect you, Inspector.\u0027\n The Scotsman was surprised.\n \u0027Have a care,\u0027 Kostaki continued. \u0027These are awkward times. All positions are precarious.\u0027\n Von Klatka reached into the wagon and tickled a shrinking girl\u0027s ankle. He enjoyed his sport. He turned to Kostaki, grinning for approval.\n A vampire emerged from the shadows of the park. Kostaki immediately saluted. General Iorga - a blusterer if ever there was - had been caught in the rioting; now, he strode about, with that arrogant devil Hentzau in tow, as if fresh from winning the Battle of Austerlitz. Iorga grunted to get von Klatka\u0027s attention and was rewarded with another salute. He was one of those officers, as common in the armies of the living as of the un-dead, who need constant reassurance of their importance. What of his time was not spent snivelling to his superiors was taken up with being beastly to his subordinates. For four hundred years, Iorga had vowed eternal fealty to the cause of Dracula, and for as long he had secretly hoped someone would hoist the impaler on one of his own stakes. The General saw himself as King of the Vampires. In this, he was alone: set beside the Prince, General Iorga was a featherweight.\n \u0027There will be a celebration in the barracks tonight,\u0027 Iorga told them. \u0027The Guard has triumphed.\u0027\n Mackenzie shifted his hat to shade his disgusted face, but did not contradict the General in his poaching of credit for the rout of the rioters.\n \u0027Von Klatka,\u0027 Iorga said. \u0027Cut out half a dozen of those warm women and escort them to our barracks.\u0027\n \u0027Yes sir,\u0027 von Klatka replied.\n The prisoners cried and prayed. Von Klatka made a great show of leering at each of the prisoners, rejecting this one as too old and fat, that one as too thin and stringy. He called Kostaki over for an added opinion but he pretended not to hear.\n Iorga and Hentzau strode off, capes flapping behind them. The General aped the Prince\u0027s dress, though he was too plump to carry it off properly.\n \u0027He reminds me of Sir Charles Warren,\u0027 Mackenzie said. \u0027Struts around spitting orders with no idea what it\u0027s like out here at the sharp end.\u0027\n \u0027The General is a fool. Most above the rank of Captain are.\u0027\n The policeman chuckled. \u0027As are most above the rank of Inspector.\u0027\n \u0027We can agree on that.\u0027\n Von Klatka made his choices and the turnkey helped him haul the girls - for they tended to be the youngest - out of the wagon. They clung together, shivering. Their vestments were unsuitable for a chilly night.\n \u0027Good fat martyrs they make,\u0027 said von Klatka, pinching the nearest cheek.\n The turnkey produced handcuffs and chains from the wagon and began to bind the chosen together. Von Klatka slapped one on the rear and laughed like a gay devil. The girl fell to her knees and prayed for deliverance. Von Klatka bent over and poked his red tongue into her ear. She reacted with comic disgust and the Captain was seized by convulsions of laughter.\n \u0027You, sir,\u0027 one of the women said to Mackenzie, \u0027you\u0027re warm, help us, save us...\u0027\n Mackenzie was uncomfortable. He looked away, putting his face in the dark again.\n \u0027I apologise,\u0027 Kostaki said. \u0027This is an absurdity. Azzo, get those women to the barracks. I shall join you later.\u0027\n Von Klatka saluted and dragged the girls off. He sang a shepherd\u0027s song as he led his flock away. The Guard were quartered near the Palace.\n \u0027You should not be asked to stand by for such things,\u0027 Kostaki told the policeman.\n \u0027No one should.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps not.\u0027\n The wagons trundled off, the prisoners to be distributed around London\u0027s jails. Kostaki assumed most would end up on stakes at Tyburn or put to hard labour in Devil\u0027s Dyke.\n He was alone with Mackenzie. \u0027You should become one of us, Scotsman.\u0027\n \u0027An unnatural thing?\u0027\n \u0027What is more unnatural? To live, or to die?\u0027\n \u0027To live off others.\u0027\n \u0027Who can say they do not live off others?\u0027\n Mackenzie shrugged. He had out a pipe and filled it with tobacco.\n \u0027We have much in common, you and I,\u0027 Kostaki said. \u0027Our countries have been devoured. You, a Scotsman, serve the Queen of England, and I, a Moldavian, follow a Prince of Wallachia. You are a policeman, I a soldier.\u0027\n Mackenzie lit his pipe and sucked in smoke. \u0027Are you a soldier before or after you\u0027re a vampire?\u0027\n Kostaki considered.\n \u0027I should like to think I am a soldier. Which are you first, policeman or warm?\u0027\n \u0027Alive, of course.\u0027 His pipe-bowl glowed.\n \u0027So, you have more kinship with this Jack the Ripper than with, say, Inspector Lestrade?\u0027\n Mackenzie sighed. \u0027You have me there, Kostaki. I confess it. I\u0027m a copper first and a living man second.\u0027\n \u0027Then, I repeat myself: join us. Would you leave our gift to braggarts like Iorga and Hentzau?\u0027\n Mackenzie considered. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, at last. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. Maybe when I\u0027m near death, I\u0027ll see things differently. But the Lord God didn\u0027t make us vampires.\u0027\n \u0027I believe the contrary.\u0027\n There was noise in the near distance. Shouts of men, screams of women. Steel on steel. Something breaking. Kostaki began to run. Mackenzie tried hard to keep pace. The din came from the direction von Klatka had taken. Mackenzie clutched his chest and gasped. Kostaki left him behind and covered the distance in moments.\n After sprinting through bushes, he found the scuffle. The girls were loose and von Klatka was on the ground. Five or six men in black coats, scarves tied over their faces, held him down, and one white-hooded fellow sawed at his chest with a shining dagger. Von Klatka yelled his defiance. Stuck in the ground was a stick from which hung the flag of the Christian Crusade. One of the masked men pointed a pistol. Kostaki saw the puff of smoke and prepared to shrug off yet another bullet. Then he felt a burst of pain in his knee. He had been shot with a silver ball.\n \u0027Back, vampire,\u0027 said the gunman, voice muffled.\n Mackenzie was with them now. Kostaki was ready to lunge forwards but the policeman held him back. His leg was numb. The bullet was lodged in his bones, poisoning him.\n One of the freed women kicked von Klatka in the head, doing no damage at all. The man straddling the vampire had wrenched free his cuirass. With slices from a silver knife, he exposed von Klatka\u0027s beating heart. He was handed something like a candle by one of his comrades, and thrust it into von Klatka\u0027s rib-cage.\n \u0027For Jago,\u0027 the crusader shouted, mouth moving behind his cloth mask.\n A lucifer flared and the crusaders scattered away from their handiwork. There was a circle of blood around von Klatka. He held his chest together, wounds closing. The candle stuck out from his ribs, a hissing flame at its end.\n \u0027Dynamite,\u0027 Mackenzie shouted.\n Ezzelin von Klatka grasped at the burning fuse. But too late. His fist closed around the flame just as it expanded. A flash of white light turned night to day. Then a strong wind and a roar lifted Kostaki and Mackenzie off their feet. Mixed in with the blast were gobbets of vampire-flesh and scraps of von Klatka\u0027s armour and clothes.\n Kostaki scrambled to his feet. First he made sure Mackenzie, who was holding his abused ears, was not seriously hurt. Then he turned to his fallen comrade. The whole of von Klatka\u0027s torso was blown to fragments. His head was burning, his flesh putrefying fast. A gaseous stench burst from his remains and Kostaki choked on it.\n The Christian Crusade flag was fallen, dotted with burning specks.\n \u0027A reprisal for the attempt on Jago,\u0027 Kostaki said.\n Mackenzie, shaking his head to try and get the ringing out of his ears, paid attention. \u0027Most likely. Dynamite\u0027s an old Fenian trick and there are a lot of Irish in with Jago\u0027s crew. Still...\u0027 His thought trailed off. There were people running towards them. Carpathians, roused from the barracks, breastplates hastily misbuckled, swords drawn.\n \u0027Still what, Scotsman?\u0027\n Mackenzie shook his head.\n \u0027The fellow who spoke, the one with the dynamite...\u0027\n \u0027What of him?\u0027\n \u0027I could have sworn he was a vampire.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-35.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
