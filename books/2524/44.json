{"id":109237,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"ON THE WATERFRONT The body had washed up on Cuckold\u0027s Point, at the curve of Limehouse Reach. It had taken three men to drag it out of the sucking mud and deposit it on the nearest wharf. Before Genevieve and Morrison arrived, someone took the trouble to lay the corpse out into a semblance of dignity, untangling the limbs and arranging the water- and dirt-clogged clothes. A length of sailcloth was draped over the dead man to protect the sensibilities of dock-workers and waterfront idlers who happened by. He had already been identified by an inscription in his watch and, surprisingly, a cheque made out to his name. Nevertheless, they were formally to confirm the corpse\u0027s identity. As the constable lifted the sailcloth, several on-lookers made exaggerated sounds of disgust. Morrison flinched and turned away. Druitt\u0027s face had been eaten by the fish, exposing empty eye-sockets and a devil\u0027s-grin of bare teeth, but she knew him by his hairline and chin. \u0027It\u0027s him,\u0027 she said. The constable dropped the cloth and thanked them. Morrison seconded her statement. A wagon was ready to receive the body. \u0027I think he had family in Bournemouth,\u0027 Morrison told the policeman. The constable took a dutiful note. The Colonel had kept his word. Druitt\u0027s pockets were stuffed with stones; no suicide note had been manufactured, but the inference was inescapable. Another unpunished murderer was at liberty: the police would mount no campaign against him, there would be no special investigators from the Diogenes Club. What was so extraordinary about the Ripper? Within fifty yards of the river, there would be a dozen as cruel, as profligate. The Whitechapel Murderer was presumably a madman; Moran and his kind had not even that excuse. Their murders were simply stock-in-trade. With Druitt hoisted on to the wagon, the show was over. The idlers drifted off to the next spectacle and the policeman returned to his duties. She was left with Morrison, at the edge of the wharf. They walked towards Rotherhithe Street, a row of rope-merchants, public houses, sailors\u0027 lodgings, shipping offices and bawdy houses. This was the Arabian Nights quarter of London, a bazaar in the thin fog. A hundred different languages mingled. It was a heavily Chinese district and the rustle of silks still touched her with dread. At once, a veiled figure was in her way. A vampire in black pyjamas. She bowed an apology and her veil parted. Genevieve recognised the Chinese girl from the Old Jago, who had spoken for the Lord of Strange Deaths. \u0027There will be reparation for this wrong;\u0027 she said, \u0027you have the word of my master.\u0027 Then, the girl was gone. \u0027What was that about?\u0027 Morrison asked. Genevieve shrugged. The girl had spoken in Mandarin. If Charles was to be credited, she could guarantee that Colonel Moran would not avoid the consequences of his actions. But if punished, it would not be for brutal murder but for unnecessary brutal murder. The girl had disappeared into the crowds. Genevieve did not intend to return immediately to the Hall. She wanted to seek out Charles, not so much for himself but to enquire after the condition of his unfortunate fiancee. Penelope Churchward, whom she had met once and hardly warmed to, was the latest of her concerns. With multitudes shovelled into the furnace, how many could she save? Not Druitt, certainly. Not Lily Mylett. Not Cathy Eddowes. Morrison was talking to her, confiding in her. Having heard nothing, she begged his pardon. \u0027It\u0027s Dr Seward,\u0027 he repeated himself. \u0027I\u0027m worried that he\u0027s making a fool of himself with this Lucy of his.\u0027 \u0027Lucy?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what she calls herself.\u0027 Morrison was one of the rare individuals who had met Jack Seward\u0027s mysterious lady-love, and he had not been impressed. \u0027Personally, I think we\u0027ve seen her before. Under another name and in shabbier clothes.\u0027 \u0027Jack has always ridden himself too hard. Perhaps this amour is the cure for his habitual exhaustion.\u0027 Morrison shook his head. He was finding it hard to express his exact thoughts. \u0027Surely, you can have no social objection to this girl? I had thought those concerns well behind us,\u0027 said Genevieve. Morrison looked sheepish. Himself of modest birth, his work should have given him an understanding of the situations of even the meanest and most degraded. \u0027There\u0027s something wrong with Dr Seward,\u0027 he insisted. \u0027He is calm and even-tempered on the surface, more so than of late. But underneath he is losing his grasp. He forgets our names sometimes. He misremembers which year it is. I believe he is retreating to some Arcadian time, before the coming of the Prince Consort.\u0027 Genevieve pondered the notion. Recently, she found Jack hard to read. He had never been as open to her as others - as Charles, for instance, or even Arthur Morrison - but in the past few weeks he had given away almost nothing, as if his mind were behind lead shutters as stout as the cabinet in which he locked his precious wax cylinders. They stopped walking and she took Morrison\u0027s hand. At the touch of his skin, tiny memories burst. She still had Charles\u0027s blood in her; with it came fly-blown specks of faraway lands. She kept seeing a face in pain, which she assumed to be his late wife. \u0027Arthur,\u0027 she said, \u0027madness is epidemic with us. It is everywhere, like evil. There is little we can do to ease the condition, so we must learn to live with it, to make it serve us. Love is always a species of insanity. If Jack can find some purpose in this spinning world, what harm can it do?\u0027 \u0027Her name isn\u0027t Lucy. I think it\u0027s something Irish... Mary Jean, Mary Jane?\u0027 \u0027Hardly proof of direst perfidy.\u0027 \u0027She is a vampire.\u0027 Morrison stopped, realising what he had said. Embarrassed, he tried to smooth over his prejudice. \u0027I mean... you know...\u0027 \u0027I appreciate that you are concerned,\u0027 she told him, \u0027and to an extent I share your misgivings. But I don\u0027t see what we can honourably do.\u0027 Morrison was plainly torn inside. \u0027Still,\u0027 he said, \u0027something is wrong with Dr Seward. Something should be done. Something.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-44.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
