{"id":109231,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"DOWNING STREET, BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\n Godalming was late for his appointment. His neatly bandaged cut throbbed, the pain unlike anything since his turning. His head was fogged by Penelope; the old, warm Penelope who was no more, not the new-born he had left in Cadogan Square. In the cab, he slumped into a daze, reliving the passing of his bloodline. At once bloated and drained, he remembered the Dark Kiss. As himself and as Penelope. This would pass.\n In Downing Street, he was ushered quietly into the cabinet. In an instant, he was shocked sober. The room was filled, his private audience with Lord Ruthven superseded by what was obviously an important gathering. General Iorga and Sir Charles Warren were there. Also, Henry Matthews, the Home Secretary, and several other, equally distinguished vampires. Sir Danvers Carew, wearing his customary scowl, chewed an unlit cigar.\n \u0027Godalming,\u0027 Ruthven said, \u0027sit down. Lady Ducayne will have to excuse you. We are discussing the evening\u0027s atrocities.\u0027\n Godalming, befuddled, found a chair. He had missed the second act, and would have to pick up the thread.\n \u0027The Carpathian Guard has been grossly insulted,\u0027 Iorga said, \u0027and must be avenged.\u0027\n \u0027Quite, quite, quite,\u0027 mumbled Matthews. Not generally reckoned to be among the Government\u0027s ablest men, he was sometimes unkindly likened to \u0027a French dancing master\u0027. \u0027But it would be unwise to fly off the handle, what with the current delicate situation.\u0027\n Iorga thumped with a mailed fist, cracking the table. \u0027Our blood must have blood!\u0027\n Ruthven looked with distaste at the damage the Carpathian had done. The fine finish was ruined.\n \u0027Malefactors will not be allowed to escape unpunished,\u0027 the Prime Minister told the General.\n \u0027Indeed,\u0027 put in Sir Charles. \u0027We confidently expect arrests within twenty-four hours.\u0027\n \u0027Just as you have confidently expected at every opportunity for the last few months in this Ripper case,\u0027 snorted Matthews.\n The Home Secretary had quarrelled with the Commissioner before, notably in a bitter jurisdictional dispute over who was finally responsible for the newly formed Criminal Investigation Department of the Metropolitan Police. At first, each had claimed the dynamic detectives as their own, but, of late, both had been less keen; especially with the Whitechapel murders still unsolved.\n Sir Charles was angered by the needling. \u0027As you well know, Home Secretary, the police failures in this matter owe more to your refusal to allot adequate funds than to any...\u0027\n \u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 said Ruthven, quietly. \u0027This is not under discussion.\u0027\n The Home Secretary and the Commissioner slumped, each glaring at the other.\n \u0027Warren,\u0027 Ruthven addressed himself to Sir Charles, \u0027you are best placed to give an account of the position of the police force. Do so.\u0027\n Godalming listened intently. He might find out what this was about.\n Sir Charles consulted his notebook like an ordinary constable in court, and cleared his throat. \u0027At about midnight, an incident took place in St James\u0027s Park...\u0027\n \u0027... within a few hundred yards of the Palace!\u0027 Matthews put in.\n \u0027... Indeed, in the immediate environs of Buckingham Palace, although at no time were the Royal Family endangered. An officer of the Carpathian Guard was escorting a group of insurrectionists arrested earlier, during the riots.\u0027\n \u0027Dangerous criminals!\u0027 Iorga blustered.\n \u0027That is conjecture. Reports vary. Inspector Mackenzie, a witness, describes the prisoners as \"a group of frightened young women\".\u0027\n Iorga grunted.\n \u0027A band of men cornered the officer, Ezzelin von Klatka, and destroyed him. In a particularly revolting manner.\u0027\n \u0027How, exactly?\u0027 Godalming put in, intrigued.\n \u0027They stuck a stick of dynamite into his heart and set it off,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027An innovation, at least.\u0027\n \u0027It was a fine pretty mess,\u0027 Sir Charles said.\n \u0027As our American cousins might have it, that\u0027s the Carpathian Guard all over,\u0027 Ruthven remarked.\n Iorga\u0027s head was on the point of exploding, angry red swelling around his eyes. \u0027Captain von Klatka died bravely,\u0027 he snarled, \u0027a hero.\u0027\n \u0027Come, come, Iorga,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027A little levity is always welcome.\u0027\n \u0027What of the culprits?\u0027 Carew asked.\n \u0027Men in masks,\u0027 Matthews said. \u0027A cross of St George was left by the body. Obviously, Sir Charles\u0027s previous reports on the disorganisation of the Christian Crusade have been sorely in error.\u0027\n \u0027Some see this as retaliation for the attack on John Jago,\u0027 Ruthven explained. \u0027Someone has painted thin red crosses all over the city.\u0027\n \u0027Mackenzie says the murderer of von Klatka was a vampire,\u0027 Sir Charles said.\n \u0027Absurd,\u0027 Matthews shouted. \u0027You all cling together, you policemen. You cover your mistakes with lies.\u0027\n \u0027Hold fire, Matthews,\u0027 Sir Charles responded. \u0027I merely repeat the claim of an observant man at the scene. For myself, I agree with you. It is unlikely that any vampire should wish harm to the Carpathian Guard. That would be practically the same as lifting a hand against our beloved Prince Consort.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027It would, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s been done?\u0027 Carew said, his habitual angry look turning to black-faced fury.\n Sir Charles sighed. \u0027I have issued orders for the arrest of the Crusade ringleaders still at liberty after this afternoon\u0027s disturbances.\u0027\n \u0027Their heads should be on poles by sunrise.\u0027\n \u0027General Iorga, we operate under the rule of law. We must first establish the guilt of the felons.\u0027\n Iorga waved the irrelevance away. \u0027Punish them all and let God decide who is guilty.\u0027\n Sir Charles continued. \u0027We know the churches and chapels where Jago\u0027s followers gather. All are being raided. In one night, we shall put an end to the Christian Crusade.\u0027\n Ruthven thanked the Commissioner. \u0027Excellent, Warren. I am myself arranging for the Archbishop to condemn the crusaders as heretics. They will no longer have even the notional support of the Church.\u0027\n \u0027There must be further reprisals,\u0027 Iorga insisted. \u0027To stop the rot of rebellion. For von Klatka, a hundred must die.\u0027\n Ruthven considered the matter, before he took charge again. \u0027We now come to our larger purpose. Even without this fresh outrage I should have convened this meeting within a few nights. This is not an isolated incident. It has not been released to the public, but a week ago an assassin tossed a bomb at Sir Francis Varney during an official visit to Lahore. It failed to explode, but the villain escaped into the crowds. Also, there was this morning an organised mutiny in Devil\u0027s Dyke. That has been suppressed but several dangerous insurrectionists are being tracked on the Sussex Downs.\u0027\n Sir Charles looked stricken. This reflected badly on Scotland Yard. On his administration.\n Ruthven continued. \u0027Silent enim leges inter arma, as Cicero has it. Laws are dumb in the time of war. It may be necessary to suspend Habeas Corpus. The Prince Consort has already taken the title of Lord Protector, assuming the constitutional burden formerly shouldered by our dear Queen. He may yet find it useful to extend his personal powers. In that event, we in this room would most likely constitute the entire government of Great Britain and its Empire. We would be king\u0027s ministers.\u0027\n Matthews was about to protest but fell silent. Still a new-born, like Sir Charles, he was in this room only on sufferance. Their seats could easily be filled by vampire elders. Or un-dead of the new breed, who had completely abandoned their warm ways. Godalming realised how close he was to power. He might soon learn what Ruthven was grooming him for.\n A dour and silent vampire beside the Prime Minister gave him a ribbon-tied folder of papers. Godalming thought he was connected with the Secret Service.\n \u0027Thank you, Mr Croft,\u0027 Ruthven said, ripping the ribbon. He extracted a paper with finger and thumb and casually whirled it across the table to Sir Charles. \u0027This is a list of prominent people suspected of conspiracy against the Crown. They are to be arrested before the sun sets tomorrow.\u0027\n Sir Charles\u0027s lips moved as he read the list. He put it down and Godalming was able to glance over it.\n Most of the names were familiar: George Bernard Shaw, W.T. Stead, Cunningham-Grahame, Annie Besant, Lord Tennyson. Others meant little: Marie Spartali Stilman, Adam Adamant, Olive Schreiner, Alfred Waterhouse, Edward Carpenter, C.L. Dodgson. There were some surprises.\n \u0027Gilbert?\u0027 Sir Charles asked. \u0027Why? The man\u0027s as much a vampire as you or I.\u0027\n \u0027As much as you, maybe. He has lampooned us constantly. Many cannot see a vampire elder without sniggering. Not, I think, an attitude we wish to foster.\u0027\n It was hardly a coincidence that the bad baronet in Ruddigore, whose name was a byword for a certain kind of vampire, was called Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd.\n Matthews was looking over the list now, shaking his head. \u0027And Gilbert is not the only vampire here,\u0027 the Home Secretary said. \u0027You have down Soames Forsyte, my own banker.\u0027\n For once, Ruthven did not seem silly and trifling. Godalming saw cold steel claws inside the murgatroyd\u0027s velvet glove.\n \u0027Vampires are as capable of treason as the warm,\u0027 Ruthven explained. \u0027Every man and woman on that list has won their place in Devil\u0027s Dyke fair and square.\u0027\n Sir Charles was concerned. \u0027Devil\u0027s Dyke was not constructed with vampires in mind.\u0027\n \u0027Then let us be thankful that we maintain the Tower of London. It shall be converted into a prison for vampires. General Iorga, have you under your command some officer whom you have had cause to reprimand for the severity of his treatment of underlings?\u0027\n Iorga grinned, a row of jagged beast-teeth flashing. \u0027I can think of several. Graf Orlok is well-known for excess.\u0027\n \u0027Excellent. Orlok shall be made Governor of the Tower of London.\u0027\n \u0027But the man\u0027s a maniacal brute,\u0027 Matthews protested. \u0027He is no longer welcome at half the houses in London. He looks barely human.\u0027\n \u0027Just the vampire for the job,\u0027 Ruthven commented. \u0027This is statesmanship, Matthews. There are positions for all. It is simply a matter of matching personality to the task.\u0027\n Mr Croft took a note, either of the Graf \u0027s appointment or of the Home Secretary\u0027s protest. Godalming would not care to be listed in Mr Croft\u0027s notebook.\n \u0027Now, to other business. Warren, here is a draft of your new promotion policy.\u0027\n Sir Charles gasped as the paper was given him.\n \u0027Only vampires are to be advanced,\u0027 Ruthven said. \u0027This is to be a general rule in all branches of civil and military service. The warm may turn or stay where they are. It is of no consequence. And remember, Warren, only the right sort of vampires are to be promoted. I shall expect you to clean your house.\u0027\n Ruthven turned his attention to the Home Secretary and gave him another document. \u0027Matthews, this is a draft of the Emergency Powers Act which will pass in the house tomorrow evening. I consider it vital that we order the affairs of the daytime world rather more than under the haphazard system we have tolerated until the present. There will be restrictions on travel, assembly and commerce. Public houses will only open during the hours of darkness. It is time we rearranged the clock and calendar for our convenience, rather than bowed in everything to the wishes of the warm.\u0027\n Matthews swallowed the medicine. Sir Danvers Carew growled with something approaching pleasure. He was in line to replace Matthews when Ruthven made him resign.\n \u0027We are being forced to act swiftly,\u0027 Ruthven declared to the room in general. \u0027But this is no bad thing. We must keep to our decided course, whatever resistance we might meet. These are exciting nights, and we have a chance to lead the world. We are the wind from the East. We are the fury of the storm. In our wake, we will leave this country changed and tempered. Those who hesitate or stay their hands will be whisked away in the torrent. Like the Prince Consort, I intend to stand fast. Many will be destroyed utterly as the moon rises on our Empire. Mr Darwin was quite correct: only the fit shall survive. We must ensure that we are among the fittest of the fit.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-37.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
