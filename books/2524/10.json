In Beauregard\u0027s experience, the district\u0027s evil reputation was well-deserved. More nameless corpses washed up on the mudflats in a typical night than Silver Knife could account for in three months. With much creaking, rattling and shuffling, the hansom manoeuvred through an archway then came to a dead halt. The cabby must have had to bend double to scrape under the arch.\n He gripped the hilt of his sword-cane. The doors were opened for him, and red eyes glittered in the dark.\n \u0027Sorry for the inconvenience, Beauregard,\u0027 purred a silky voice, male but not entirely masculine, \u0027but I trust you\u0027ll understand. It\u0027s a sticky wicket...\u0027\n He stepped down from the cab and found himself in a yard off one of the warren of streets near the docks. The fog here was wispy, hanging like undersea fronds of yellow gauze. There were people all about. The one who spoke was an Englishman, a vampire with a good coat and soft hat, face in darkness. His posture, studied in its langour, suggested an athlete in repose; Beauregard would not care to go four rounds with him. The others were Chinese, pigtailed and bowed, hands in their sleeves. Most were warm but a massive fellow by the cab-door was new-born, naked to the waist to show off his dragon tattoos and an un-dead indifference to autumn\u0027s chill.\n As the Englishman stepped forward, moonlight caught his youthful face. He had pretty eyelashes like a woman\u0027s, and Beauregard recognised him.\n \u0027I saw you get six sixes from six balls in \u002785,\u0027 he said. \u0027In Madras. Gentlemen and Players.\u0027\n The sportsman shrugged modestly. \u0027You play what\u0027s chucked at you, I always say.\u0027\n He had heard the new-born\u0027s name in the Star Chamber, tentatively linked with daring but somehow amusing jewel robberies. He supposed the sportsman\u0027s involvement in this evident kidnapping confirmed that he was indeed the author of those criminal feats. Beauregard believed even a gentleman should have a profession, and always backed the Players against the Gentlemen.\n \u0027This way,\u0027 said the amateur cracksman, indicating a wet stretch of stone wall. The new-born Chinese pressed a brick and a section of the wall tilted upwards, forming a hatch-like door. \u0027Duck down or you\u0027ll bash your bean. Deuced small, these chinks.\u0027\n He followed the new-born, who could see in the dark better than he, and was in turn followed by the rest of the party. As the vampire stooped, dragons on his shoulder-blades silently roared and flapped. They proceeded down a sloping passageway, and he realised they were below street level. The surfaces were damp and glistening, the air cold and bad: these chambers must be close to the river. As they passed a chute from which could be dimly heard rippling water, Beauregard was reminded of the nameless cadavers, supposing this place the source of quite a few of their number. The passage widened and he deduced this part of the labyrinth dated back centuries. Objets d\u0027art, mostly of undoubted antiquity and oriental appearance, stood at significant junctures. After many turns and descents and doors, his kidnappers were sure he could never find his way unescorted to the surface. He was pleased to be underestimated.\n Something chattered behind a wall and he flinched. He could not identify the animal din. The new-born turned to the noise and yanked the head of a jade caterpillar. A door opened and Beauregard was ushered into a dimly-lit, richly furnished drawing room. There were no windows, just chinoiserie screens. The centrepiece was a large desk, behind which sat an ancient Chinaman. Long, hard fingernails tapped like knifepoints on his blotter. There were others, in comfortable armchairs arranged in a half-circle about the desk. The unseen chattering thing quieted.\n One man turned his head, red cigar-end making a Devil\u0027s mask of his face. He was a vampire, but the Chinaman was not.\n \u0027Mr Charles Beauregard,\u0027 began the Celestial, \u0027you are so kind to join our wretched and unworthy selves.\u0027\n \u0027You are so kind to invite me.\u0027\n The Chinaman clapped his hands, and nodded to a cold-faced servant, a Burmese.\n \u0027Take our visitor\u0027s hat, cloak and cane.\u0027\n Beauregard was relieved of his burdens. When the Burmese was close enough, Beauregard observed the singular earring, and the ritual tattooing about his neck.\n \u0027A dacoit?\u0027 he enquired.\n \u0027You are so very observant,\u0027 affirmed the Chinaman.\n \u0027I have some little experience of the world of secret societies.\u0027\n \u0027Indeed you have, Mr Beauregard. Our paths have crossed three times: in Egypt, in the Kashmir, and in Shanghai. You caused me some little inconvenience.\u0027\n Beauregard realised to whom he was talking, and tried to smile. He assumed he was a dead man.\n \u0027My apologies, Doctor.\u0027\n The Chinaman leaned forward, face emerging into the light, fingernails clacking. He had the brow of a Shakespeare and a smile that put Beauregard in mind of a smug Satan.\n \u0027Think nothing of it.\u0027 He brushed away apologies. \u0027Those were trivial matters, of no import beyond the ordinary. I shall not prosecute any personal business in this instance.\u0027\n Beauregard tried not to show his relief. Whatever else he was, the criminal mandarin was known to be a man of his word. This was the person they called \u0027the Devil Doctor\u0027 or \u0027the Lord of Strange Deaths\u0027. He was one of the Council of Seven, the ruling body of the Si-Fan, a tong whose influence extended to all the quarters of the Earth. Mycroft reckoned the Celestial among the three most dangerous men in the world.\n \u0027Although,\u0027 the Chinaman added, \u0027were this meeting to take place very far to the East, I fancy its agenda would not be so pleasant for you and, I confess, for myself. You understand me?\u0027\n Beauregard did, all too well. They met under a flag of truce, but it would be lowered as soon as the Diogenes Club again required him to work against the Si-Fan.\n \u0027Those affairs are not of interest to us at this moment.\u0027\n The amateur cracksman turned up the gaslight and faces became clear. The chattering thing burst into its screech and was quelled only by a mild glance from the Devil Doctor. In one corner was a large golden cage, built as if for a parrot with a six-foot wingspan, containing a long-tailed ape. It bared yellow teeth in bright pink gums that took up two-thirds of its face. The Chinaman was renowned for a strange taste in pets, as Beauregard had cause to recall whenever he used his snakeskin-handled boot scraper.\n \u0027Business,\u0027 snorted a military-looking vampire, \u0027time is money, remember...\u0027\n \u0027A thousand pardons, Colonel Moran. In the East, things are different. Here, we must bow to your Western ways, hurry and bustle, haste and industry.\u0027\n The cigar-smoker stood up, unbending a lanky figure from which hung a frock coat marked around the pockets with chalk. The Colonel deferred to him and sat back, eyes falling. The smoker\u0027s head oscillated from side to side like a lizard\u0027s, eye-teeth protruding over his lower lip.\n \u0027My associate is a businessman,\u0027 he explained between puffs, \u0027our cricketing friend is a dilettante, Griffin over there is a scientist, Captain Macheath - who, by the way, sends his apologies - is a soldier, Sikes is continuing his family business, I am a mathematician, but you, my dear doctor, are an artist.\u0027\n \u0027The Professor flatters me.\u0027\n Beauregard had heard of the Professor too. Mycroft\u0027s brother, the consulting detective, had a craze of sorts for him. He might well be the worst Englishman unhanged.\n \u0027With two of the three most dangerous men in the world in one room,\u0027 he observed, \u0027I have to ask myself where the third might be?\u0027\n \u0027I see our names and positions are not unknown to you, Mr Beauregard,\u0027 said the Chinaman. \u0027Dr Nikola is unavailable for our little gathering. I believe he may be found investigating some sunken ships off the coast of Tasmania. He no longer concerns us. He has his own interests.\u0027\n Beauregard looked at the others in the meeting, those still unaccounted for. Griffin, whom the Professor had mentioned, was an albino who seemed to fade into the background. Sikes was a pig-faced man, warm, short, burly and brutal. With a loud striped jacket and cheap oil on his hair, he looked out of place in such a distinguished gathering. Alone in the company, he was the image of a criminal.\n \u0027Professor, if you would care to explain to our honoured guest...\u0027\n \u0027Thank you, Doctor,\u0027 replied the man sometimes called \u0027the Napoleon of Crime\u0027. \u0027Mr Beauregard, as you are aware none of us - and I include you among our number - has what we might call common cause. We pursue our own furrows. If they happen to intersect... well, that is often unfortunate. Lately there have been the changes, but, whatever personal metamorphoses we might welcome, our calling has remained essentially the same. We are, as we always have been, a shadow community. To an extent, we have reached an accommodation. We pit our wits against each other, but when the sun comes up we draw a line. We let well enough alone. It grieves me greatly to have to say this, but that line seems not to be holding...\u0027\n \u0027There was police raids all over the East End,\u0027 Sikes interrupted. \u0027Balmy Charlie Warren\u0027s sent in another bleedin\u0027 cavalry charge. Years of bloody work overturned in a single night. \u0027Ouses smashed. Gamblin\u0027, opium, girls: nuffin\u0027 sacred. Our business \u0027as been bought \u0027n\u0027 paid for, an\u0027 the filthy peelers done us dirty when they went back on the deal.\u0027\n \u0027I have no connection with the police,\u0027 Beauregard said.\n \u0027Do not think us na?ve,\u0027 said the Professor. \u0027Like all agents of the Diogenes Club, you have no official position at all. But what is official and what is effective are separate things.\u0027\n \u0027This persecution of our interests will continue,\u0027 the Doctor said, \u0027so long as the gentleman known as Silver Knife is at liberty.\u0027\n Beauregard nodded. \u0027I suppose so. There\u0027s always a chance the murderer will be turned up by the raids.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s not one of us,\u0027 snorted Colonel Moran.\n \u0027\u0027E\u0027s a ravin\u0027 nutter, that\u0027s what \u0027e is. Listen, none of us is \u0027zactly squeamish - know what I mean? - but this bloke is takin\u0027 it too far. If an \u0027ore gets too rorty, you takes a razor to \u0027er fyce not \u0027er bleedin\u0027 froat.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s never been any suggestion, so far as I know, that any of you are involved in the murders.\u0027\n \u0027That is not the point, Mr Beauregard,\u0027 the Professor continued. \u0027Our shadow empire is like a spider-web. It extends throughout the world but it concentrates here, in this city. Thick and complicated and surprisingly delicate. If enough threads are severed, it will fall. And threads are being severed left and right. We have all suffered since Mary Ann Nichols was killed, and the inconvenience will redouble with each fresh atrocity. Every time this murderer strikes at the public, he stabs at us also.\u0027\n \u0027My \u0027ores don\u0027t wanna go on the streets wiv \u0027im out there. It\u0027s \u0027urtin\u0027 me pockets. I\u0027m seriously out of the uxter.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure the police will catch the man. There\u0027s a reward of fifty pounds for information.\u0027\n \u0027And we have posted a reward of a thousand guineas but nothing has come of it.\u0027\n \u0027Forget what they say about us on the screw stickin\u0027 together like Ikeys. If we tumbled old Silver Knife, \u0027e\u0027d be narked to the esclop quicker\u0027n an Irish dipper can flimp a drunkard\u0027s pogue.\u0027\n \u0027I beg your pardon?\u0027\n \u0027Mr Beauregard,\u0027 said the Doctor. \u0027What our associate is venturing to suggest is that we should like to add our humble efforts to those of your most estimable police. We pledge that any intimate knowledge which comes into our possession - as knowledge on so many matters so often does - shall be passed directly to you. In return we ask that the personal interest in this matter, which we know the Diogenes Club has required you take, be persecuted with the utmost vigour.\u0027\n He tried not to show it, but was deeply shocked that the innermost workings of the ruling cabal were somehow known to the Lord of Strange Deaths. And yet the Chinaman evidently knew in detail of the briefing he had been given barely two days earlier. The briefing at which it had been assumed no more would be heard from the Si-Fan for some years.\n \u0027This bounder is letting the side down,\u0027 the amateur cracksman said, \u0027and it\u0027d be best if he stripped his whites and slunk back to the bally pavilion.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ve put up a thousand guineas for information,\u0027 the Colonel said, \u0027and two thousand for his rotten head.\u0027\n \u0027Unlike the police, we have no trouble with mendacious individuals coming forward offering false information in the hope of swindling us out of a reward. Such individuals do not long survive in our spider-web world. Do we have an understanding, Mr Beauregard?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Professor.\u0027\n The new-born smiled a thin smile. One murderer meant very little to these men, but a loose cannon of crime was an inconvenience they would not brook.\n \u0027And when the Whitechapel Murderer is caught?\u0027\n \u0027Then it\u0027s business as usual,\u0027 said Moran.\n The Doctor nodded sagely, and Sikes spat out \u0027too bloody right, pal.\u0027\n \u0027Once our agreement is at an end,\u0027 the Chinaman announced, \u0027we shall revert to our former positions. And I should advise you to settle down with your Miss Churchward and leave the affairs of my countrymen to other hands. You have been unlucky with wives and you deserve your few years of contentment.\u0027\n Beauregard contained his anger. The threat to Penelope was beyond the boundaries.\n \u0027For myself,\u0027 said the Professor, eyes gleaming, \u0027I hope to disengage, and hand over the everyday running of my organisation to Colonel Moran. I now have the opportunity to live for centuries, which will give me the time I need to refine my model of the universe. I intend to undertake a voyage into pure mathematics, a voyage which will take me beyond the dull geometries of space.\u0027\n The Doctor smiled, crinkling his eyes and lifting his thin moustaches. Only he seemed to appreciate the Professor\u0027s grandiose schemes. Everyone else in the ring looked as if they had eaten bad eggs while the Professor\u0027s eyes glowed with the thought of an infinity of multiplying theorems, expanding to fill all space.\n \u0027Conceive of it,\u0027 the Professor said, \u0027one theorem encompassing everything.\u0027\n \u0027A cab will take you to Cheyne Walk,\u0027 the Celestial explained. \u0027This meeting is at an end. Serve our purpose, and you will be rewarded. Fail us, and the consequences will be... not so pleasant.\u0027\n With a wave, Beauregard was dismissed.\n \u0027Our regards to your Miss Churchward,\u0027 said Moran, leering nastily. Beauregard fancied he detected a moue of distaste on the Chinaman\u0027s proverbially inscrutable face.\n As the sportsman took him back up through the passages, Beauregard wondered how many Devils he would have to ally himself with to discharge his duty. He resisted the urge to demonstrate bravado by forging ahead and leading his guide to the entrance. He could have pulled off the stunt, but it might be as well to remain in the underestimation of the ring.\n When they reached the surface, it was near dawn. The first streaks of blue-grey crept upwards from the East, and the seagulls drawn inland by the Thames squawked for breakfast.\n The cab still stood in the yard, the driver perched on the box, swaddled in black blankets. Beauregard\u0027s hat, cloak and cane were waiting for him inside.\n \u0027Toodle-oo,\u0027 said the cricketer, red eyes shining. \u0027See you at Lords.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-10.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
