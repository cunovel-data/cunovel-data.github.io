{"id":109214,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"NEW GRUB STREET\n September was nearly done. It was the morning of the 28th. Silver Knife had not murdered since Lulu Sch?n, on the 17th. Of course, Whitechapel was now so crowded with policemen and reporters that the killer might be overcome with shyness. Unless, as some had theorised, he was a policeman or a reporter.\n With the sun up, the streets were sparsely populated. The fog had blown away for the moment, giving him a cold, clear look at the place that had become his second home. Beauregard had to admit he did not much care for it, by day or night. After another fruitless shift with resentful detectives, he was tired to the point of exhaustion. Professional feeling was that the trail was cooling fast. The murderer might have succumbed to his own mania and turned his knife against himself. Or simply hopped on a steamer for America or Australia. Soon, everywhere in the world you could go, there would be vampires.\n \u0027Maybe he\u0027s just stopped,\u0027 Sergeant Thick had suggested. \u0027They do sometimes. He could spend the rest of his life sniggering every time he passes a copper. Maybe he doesn\u0027t get his jollies with the knife, maybe the thing is that he wants to have a secret all to himself.\u0027\n That had not sounded right to Beauregard. From the autopsies, he believed Silver Knife got his jollies cutting up vampire women. Although the victims were not conventionally violated, it was obvious the crimes were sexual in nature. Privately, Dr Phillips, the H Division Police Surgeon, theorised that the murderer might practice the sin of Onan at the site of his crimes. Little connected with this case was not utterly repulsive to decent sensibilities.\n \u0027Mr Beauregard,\u0027 a female voice interrupted his thoughts. \u0027Charles?\u0027\n A young person with a black bonnet and smoked glasses crossed the street to talk to him. Although it was not raining, she had up a black umbrella, shading her face. The wind caught and it tilted, swinging back the shadow.\n \u0027Why, it\u0027s Miss Reed,\u0027 Beauregard exclaimed, surprised. \u0027Kate?\u0027\n The girl smiled to be remembered.\n \u0027What brings you to these unsavoury parts?\u0027\n \u0027Journalism, Charles. Remember, I scribble.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. Your essay on the consequences of the match-girl strike in Our Corner was exemplary. Radical, of course, but exceedingly fair.\u0027\n \u0027That is probably the first and only time the expression \"exceedingly fair\" will be used in connection with me, but I thank you for the compliment.\u0027\n \u0027You underrate yourself, Miss Reed.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 she mused, before proceeding to her current business. \u0027I\u0027m looking for Uncle Diarmid. Have you seen him?\u0027\n Beauregard knew Kate\u0027s uncle was one of the head men at the Central News Agency. The police thought highly of him, rating him one of the few scrupulous pressmen on the crime circuit.\n \u0027Not recently. Is he here? On a story?\u0027\n \u0027The story. Silver Knife.\u0027\n Kate was fidgety, holding close a mannish document folder which seemed to have some totemic value. Her umbrella was larger than she could easily manage.\n \u0027There\u0027s something different about you, Miss Reed. Have you perhaps changed the style of your hair?\u0027\n \u0027No, Mr Beauregard.\u0027\n \u0027Odd. I could have sworn...\u0027\n \u0027Maybe you haven\u0027t seen me since I turned.\u0027\n It hit him at once that she was nosferatu. \u0027I beg your pardon.\u0027\n She shrugged. \u0027That\u0027s all right. A lot of the girls are turning, you know. My - what do they call them? - father-in-darkness has many get. He is Mr Frank Harris, the editor.\u0027\n \u0027I have heard of him. He is a friend of Florence Stoker\u0027s, isn\u0027t he?\u0027\n \u0027He used to be, I think.\u0027\n Her patron, famous for championing people then breaking with them, was notoriously profligate with his affections. Kate was a direct young woman; Beauregard could see why she might appeal to Mr Frank Harris, the editor.\n She must have some important mission to venture out by day, even heavily shrouded from the sun, so soon after turning.\n \u0027There is a cafe nearby where the reporters gather. It\u0027s not quite the place for an unaccompanied young lady, but...\u0027\n \u0027Then, Mr Beauregard, you must accompany me, for I have something Uncle Diarmid must see immediately. I hope you do not think me forward or presumptuous. I would not ask if it were not important.\u0027\n Kate Reed had always been pale and thin. The turn actually made her complexion seem healthier. Beauregard felt the force of her will, and was not inclined to resist.\n \u0027Very well, Miss Reed. This way...\u0027\n \u0027Call me Kate. Charles.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. Kate.\u0027\n \u0027How is Penny? I have not seen her since...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m rather afraid that neither have I. My guess is that she is in something of a pet.\u0027\n \u0027Not the first time.\u0027\n Beauregard frowned.\n \u0027Oh, I am sorry, Charles. I didn\u0027t mean to say that. I can be a fearful twit at times.\u0027\n She made him smile.\n \u0027Here,\u0027 he said.\n The Cafe de Paris was on Commercial Street, near the police station. A pie-and-eels-and-pitchers-of-tea establishment, formerly catering to market porters and police constables, it was now full of men with curly moustaches and check suits, arguing about bylines and headlines. The reason the place was such a hit with the press was that the proprietor had installed one of the new telephone devices. He allowed reporters, for a penny a time, to place calls to their head offices, even to the extent of dictating stories over the wire.\n \u0027Welcome to futurity,\u0027 he said, holding open the door for Kate.\n She saw what he meant. \u0027Oh, how wonderful.\u0027\n An angry little American in a rumpled white suit and a straw hat from the last decade was holding the mouth- and ear-pieces of the apparatus, and yelling at an unseen editor.\n \u0027I\u0027m telling you,\u0027 he shouted, loud enough to render the miracle of modern science superfluous, \u0027I\u0027ve a dozen witnesses who swear the Silver Knife is a were-wolf.\u0027\n The man at the other end shouted, giving the exasperated reporter a chance to draw breath. \u0027Anthony,\u0027 he said, \u0027this is news. We work for a newspaper, we are supposed to print news!\u0027\n The reporter wrestled with the device, shutting off the call, and passed it on to the next man, a startled new-born, in the queue for the device.\n \u0027Over to you, LeQueux,\u0027 the American said. \u0027Better luck with your runaway steam-driven automaton theory.\u0027\n LeQueux, whom Beauregard had read in the Globe, rattled the telephone, and began whispering to the operator.\n A small group of urchins played marbles in a corner, while Diarmid Reed held court by an open fire. He sucked on a pipe as he lectured a circle of Grub Street toilers.\n \u0027A story is like a woman, lads,\u0027 he said, \u0027you can chase her and catch her, but you can\u0027t make her stay longer than she wants to. Sometimes, you come down to a kipper breakfast and she\u0027s upped stakes.\u0027\n Beauregard coughed to attract Reed\u0027s attention lest he embarrass himself before his niece. Reed looked up, and grinned.\n \u0027Katie,\u0027 he said, without a speck of regret for his indecent metaphor. \u0027Come in and have some tea. And Beauregard, isn\u0027t it? Where did you find my benighted niece? Not in some house hereabouts, I hope. Her poor mother always said she\u0027d be the ruin of the family.\u0027\n \u0027Uncle, this is important.\u0027\n He looked benignly sceptical. \u0027Just as your women\u0027s suffrage story was important?\u0027\n \u0027Uncle, whether or not you agree with my views on that question, you must concede that a mass expression of them, involving many of the greatest and wisest in the land, is news. Especially when the Prime Minister responds by sending in the Carpathians.\u0027\n \u0027Tell \u0027em girl,\u0027 said the man in the straw hat.\n Kate gave Beauregard her umbrella and unbuckled her document case. She laid a paper on the table, between teacups and ashtrays.\n \u0027This came in yesterday. Remember, you had me opening letters as a punishment.\u0027\n Reed was examining the paper closely. It was covered in a spidery red hand.\n \u0027You have brought this straight to me?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been looking for you all night.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a good little vampire,\u0027 said a stripe-shirted new-born newsman with waxed moustache points.\n \u0027Shut up, D\u0027Onston,\u0027 Reed said. \u0027My niece drinks printers\u0027 ink, not blood. She\u0027s got news in her veins just where you\u0027ve got warm water.\u0027\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 LeQueux asked, breaking his telephone connection to catch up with the development.\n Reed ignored the question. He found a penny in his waistcoat pocket and summoned one of the urchins.\n \u0027Ned, go to the police station and find someone above the rank of sergeant. You know what that means.\u0027\n The sharp-eyed child made a face that suggested he knew all about the varieties and habits of policemen.\n \u0027Tell them the Central News Agency has received a letter, purporting to be from Silver Knife. Just those words, exactly.\u0027\n \u0027Pr\u0027porten?\u0027\n \u0027Purporting.\u0027\n The barefoot Mercury snatched the tossed penny out of the air and dashed off.\n \u0027I tell you,\u0027 he began, \u0027kids like Ned will inherit the earth. The twentieth century will be beyond our imagining.\u0027\n No one wanted to listen to social theories. Everyone wanted a look at the letter.\n \u0027Careful,\u0027 Beauregard said. \u0027That is evidence, I believe.\u0027\n \u0027Well said. Now, back off boys, and give me some room.\u0027\n Reed held the letter carefully, rereading it.\n \u0027One thing,\u0027 he said when he had finished. \u0027This is an end for Silver Knife.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said LeQueux.\n \u0027\"Don\u0027t mind me giving the trade name,\" it says in the postscript.\u0027\n \u0027Trade name?\u0027 D\u0027Onstan asked.\n \u0027\"Jack the Ripper\". He signs himself \"Yours truly, Jack the Ripper\".\u0027\n D\u0027Onstan whispered the name, rolling it around his mouth. Others joined in the chorus. The Ripper. Jack the Ripper. Jack. The Ripper. Beauregard felt a chill.\n Kate was pleased, and looked modestly at her boot-toes.\n \u0027Beauregard, would you care?\u0027\n Reed gave him the letter, exciting grumbles of envy from the rival newspapermen.\n \u0027Read it out,\u0027 the American suggested. Feeling a touch self-conscious, Beauregard tried to recite.\n \u0027\"Dear Boss,\"\u0027 the letter began. \u0027The hand is hurried and spiky, but suggests an education, a man used to writing.\u0027\n \u0027Cut the editorial,\u0027 LeQueux said, \u0027give it us straight.\u0027\n \u0027\"I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont\" - no apostrophe - \"they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track...\"\u0027\n \u0027Bright boy,\u0027 D\u0027Onstan said. \u0027He\u0027s got Lestrade and Abberline bang to rights there.\u0027\n Everyone shushed the interruptor.\n \u0027\"That joke about Silver Knife gave me real fits. I am down on leeches and shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled. Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal. How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again. You will soon hear of me with my funny little games.\"\u0027\n \u0027Degenerate filth,\u0027 spluttered D\u0027Onstan. Beauregard had to agree.\n \u0027\"I saved some of the proper red stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it. Red ink is fit enough I hope. Ha ha. The next job I do I shall clip the ladys ears off and send to the police officers just for jolly wouldnt you...\"\u0027\n \u0027Jolly wouldn\u0027t you? What is that, a joke?\u0027\n \u0027Our man\u0027s a comedian,\u0027 said LeQueux. \u0027Grimaldi reborn.\u0027\n \u0027\"Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work, then give it out straight.\"\u0027\n \u0027Sounds like my editor,\u0027 said the American.\n \u0027\"My knife\u0027s so nice and silver and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance. Good luck.\" And, as Reed said, \"Yours truly, jack the Ripper. Dont mind me giving the trade name.\" There\u0027s another postscript. \"Wasnt good enough to post this before I got all the red ink off my hands, curse it. No luck yet. They say I\u0027m a doctor now, ha ha.\"\u0027\n \u0027Ha ha,\u0027 said an angry elderly man from the Star. \u0027Ha bloody ha. I\u0027d give him a ha-ha if he were here.\u0027\n \u0027How do we know he isn\u0027t?\u0027 said D\u0027Onstan, rolling his eyes, wiping his moustache like a melodrama villain.\n Ned was back, with Lestrade and a couple of constables, puffing as if they had been told the murderer himself, not merely a communication from him, were in the Cafe de Paris.\n Beauregard handed the letter to the Inspector. As he read, his lips forming the words, the journalists discussed it.\n \u0027It\u0027s a ruddy hoax,\u0027 someone said. \u0027Some joker making trouble for us all.\u0027\n \u0027I think it\u0027s genuine,\u0027 opined Kate. \u0027There\u0027s a creepiness about it that sounds authentic to me. All that fake funny. The perverse relish drips off the page. When I first opened it, even before reading, I had a profound sense of evil, of loneliness, of purpose.\u0027\n \u0027Whatever it is,\u0027 the American said, \u0027it\u0027s news. They can\u0027t stop us printing this.\u0027\n Lestrade put up his hand as if he might have some objection, but let it fall before he said anything.\n \u0027Jack the Ripper, eh,\u0027 said Reed. \u0027We couldn\u0027t have done better ourselves. The old Silver Knife monicker was wearing thin. Now, we\u0027ve a proper name for the blighter.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-20.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
