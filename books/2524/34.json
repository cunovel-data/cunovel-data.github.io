{"id":109228,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"CONFIDENCES\n \u0027You should be upstairs, resting,\u0027 Amworth told her. \u0027You\u0027ll mend sooner.\u0027\n \u0027Why should I get well?\u0027 Genevieve asked. \u0027The hopping toad will only return and finish me off.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know that.\u0027\n \u0027Yes I do. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s going to destroy me, but I know it will. I\u0027ve been in China. Those creatures don\u0027t give up of their own accord. They can\u0027t be reasoned with and they can\u0027t be stopped. I might as well go out in the street and wait for it to come for me. At least that way, no one else would be in the way.\u0027\n Amworth was impatient. \u0027You hurt it last time.\u0027\n \u0027And it hurt me worse.\u0027\n She was not entirely better. She often found herself moving her head around, to test her broken and re-set neck. Her head had not fallen off yet, but sometimes it felt about to.\n Genevieve looked around the lecture hall that had become a makeshift infirmary. \u0027No Chinese callers?\u0027\n The nurse shook her head. She was listening to the chest of a little new-born girl. For a moment, Genevieve thought it was Lily. Then, she remembered. The patient was Rebecca Kosminski.\n \u0027I wish I knew which of the enemies I\u0027ve cultivated was responsible.\u0027\n The Chinese vampire was a hireling. All over the East, such creatures were employed as assassins.\n \u0027I expect I\u0027ll be told. It would seem a waste not to let me know why my head is being torn off.\u0027\n \u0027Shush,\u0027 Amworth said. \u0027You\u0027re frightening the girl.\u0027\n With a squirt of guilt, she saw the nurse was right. Rebecca looked thoughtful but her eyes had shrunk to tiny points.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she apologised. \u0027Rebecca, I was just being silly, making up stories.\u0027\n Rebecca smiled. In a few years, she would never believe a lie that transparent. But now she was still a child inside.\n Feeling useless - all her duties had been reassigned for a specified period of convalescence - Genevieve loitered in the infirmary for a few minutes then drifted out to the corridor.\n The director\u0027s office was locked; Montague Druitt lurked outside. Genevieve bade him a good evening.\n \u0027Where\u0027s Dr Seward?\u0027 she asked.\n Druitt was reluctant to talk to her but got the words out. \u0027He\u0027s off somewhere, with no explanation. It\u0027s most inconvenient.\u0027\n \u0027Can I be of assistance? As you know, I have the director\u0027s confidence.\u0027\n Druitt shook his head, lips pressed tight. It was business for warm men, he was thinking. Genevieve could not tell what the man wanted. He was another of the Hall\u0027s scorched souls; she had no hope of making common cause with him, much less of being any help.\n She left him in the corridor and traipsed out to the foyer, where an unfriendly warm nurse directed a stream of malingerers back into the fog, occasionally deigning to admit someone obviously suffering mortal injury.\n Dr Seward had been much absent recently. She supposed he had some private grief. Like everyone else. Through all the pain of her broken bones, she still could not get the death of Pamela Beauregard out of her mind. Everyone lost people. She had been losing people for hundreds of years. But in Charles, the loss still burned.\n \u0027Miss Dieudonne?\u0027\n It was a new-born woman. She had come in from outside. She was dressed well, but not expensively.\n \u0027Do you remember me? Kate Reed?\u0027\n \u0027Miss Reed, the journalist?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right. The Central News Agency.\u0027 She stuck out her hand to be shaken; Genevieve responded weakly in kind.\n \u0027What can be done for you, Miss Reed?\u0027\n The new-born let go Genevieve\u0027s hand.\n \u0027I was hoping I could talk to you? It\u0027s about the other night. That Chinese thing. The butterflies.\u0027\n Genevieve shrugged.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s anything I can tell you that you don\u0027t know. It was an elder. Evidently the butterflies are a quirk of its bloodline. Some German nosferatu have a similar affinity for rats, and you must have heard of the Carpathians and their pet wolves.\u0027\n \u0027Why were you singled out for persecution?\u0027\n \u0027I wish I knew. I have passed blamelessly through life doing nought but good deeds, and am beloved by all whose path I have crossed. It is beyond conception that anyone could nurture in their heart hostile feelings for me.\u0027\n Miss Reed did not appear to notice the irony. \u0027Do you think the assault has anything to do with your interest in the Whitechapel murders?\u0027\n That had not occurred to Genevieve. She considered a moment. \u0027I doubt it. Whatever you might have heard, I am scarcely an important figure in the investigation. The police have talked to me about the effects of the murders on this community, but that is the extent of my involvement...\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027ve been consulted by Charles... by Mr Beauregard. The other night...\u0027\n \u0027Again, he has spoken with me but nothing more. I understand I owe him a debt of gratitude for distracting the elder.\u0027\n Miss Reed was rather intent on digging out something. Genevieve had the impression that the lady journalist was more interested in Charles than in the Ripper.\n \u0027And what is Mr Beauregard\u0027s actual involvement in the investigation?\u0027\n \u0027That, you would have to ask him.\u0027\n \u0027I shall,\u0027 Miss Reed said. \u0027When he can be found.\u0027\n \u0027He can be found here, Kate,\u0027 Charles said.\n He had come into the foyer a few minutes ago. Genevieve had not noticed him standing quietly in the corner. Miss Reed\u0027s eyes narrowed and she slipped on a pair of smoked glasses. She had the new-born\u0027s pallor, but Genevieve discerned the ghost of a blush on her cheeks.\n \u0027Um,\u0027 Miss Reed said. \u0027Charles, good evening.\u0027\n \u0027I come to call upon an invalid, but I find her quite recovered.\u0027\n Charles bowed to Genevieve. Miss Reed\u0027s line of questioning had petered out.\n \u0027Thank you for your time, Miss Dieudonne,\u0027 she said. \u0027I shall leave you to entertain your caller. Charles, good night.\u0027\n The new-born flitted out into the night.\n \u0027What was all that about?\u0027\n She shrugged, and her neck hurt. \u0027I don\u0027t know, Charles. Are you familiar with Miss Reed?\u0027\n \u0027Kate\u0027s a friend of my... a friend of Penelope\u0027s.\u0027 At his own mention of his fiancee - whose veiled face and guardedly hostile eyes Genevieve had cause to remember - Charles\u0027s face fell, and he shook his head. \u0027Maybe she has been talking with Penelope,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027It is more than I have been.\u0027\n Despite herself, Genevieve was interested. She should be beyond such things, but in her weakness she reverted to a silly gossip.\n \u0027I had the impression that you were required to call upon Miss Churchward this afternoon.\u0027\n Charles half-smiled. \u0027You were not alone in that impression but circumstances intervened. There was trouble in St James\u0027s Park.\u0027\n She found Charles holding her hands as if feeling the bones for damage.\n \u0027Forgive me for being overly inquisitive but there is something about your domestic arrangements that puzzles me.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, really,\u0027 he said, cooling.\n \u0027Yes. Am I correct in assuming that Miss Churchward, Penelope, is a connection of Mrs Beauregard, Pamela, your former wife...\u0027\n Charles\u0027s face betrayed nothing.\n \u0027I would assume them sisters were it not for the fact, demonstrated by Mr Holman Hunt and Miss Waugh, that if such were so, your engagement would constitute incest under English law.\u0027\n \u0027Penelope is Pamela\u0027s cousin. They were brought up in the same household. As sisters, if you will.\u0027\n \u0027So you intend to marry the pseudo-sister of your late wife?\u0027\n He picked his words carefully. \u0027That was indeed my intent.\u0027\n \u0027Does this not strike you as a peculiar arrangement?\u0027\n Charles let go of her hands and turned away with a suspiciously casual aspect. \u0027No stranger than any other, surely...\u0027\n \u0027Charles, I do not wish to embarrass you, but you must remember... the other night in the cab... through no fault of mine, I have some, uh, some understanding of your feelings, for Pamela, for Penelope...\u0027\n Sighing, Charles said, \u0027Genevieve, I appreciate your concern but I assure you it is quite needless. Whatever the motives for my engagement might have been, they now mean nothing. It is my understanding that, through no action of my own, I am released from my promise to Penelope.\u0027\n \u0027My condolences.\u0027 She put her hand on his shoulder and turned him so she could see his eyes.\n \u0027Condolences are unnecessary.\u0027\n \u0027I was flippant about Penelope the other night. I was light-headed, you understand. Close to hysterical.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d nearly been killed,\u0027 Charles said, with feeling. \u0027You were not responsible.\u0027\n \u0027Nevertheless, I regret what I said, what I implied...\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Charles said, looking at her straight-on. \u0027You were exactly right. I was being unfair to Penelope. I do not feel for her as a man should for his wife. I was merely using her to replace the irreplaceable. She is better off without me. Just recently, I\u0027ve been feeling... I don\u0027t know, feeling as if I\u0027d lost an arm. As if I were not complete without Pamela.\u0027\n \u0027You mean Penelope?\u0027\n \u0027I mean Pamela, that\u0027s the terrible thing.\u0027\n \u0027What will you do now?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll have eventually to see Penelope and clear things between us. She\u0027ll find a far better catch than me. As for myself, I have more important affairs to consider.\u0027\n \u0027Such as?\u0027\n \u0027Such as the Whitechapel Murders. Also, I want to see what I can do about saving your life.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-34.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
