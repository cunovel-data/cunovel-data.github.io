{"id":109238,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"DRINK, PRETTY CREATURE, DRINK Her touch had changed him. For two days, Beauregard had been troubled by dreams. Dreams in which Genevieve, sometimes herself and sometimes a needle-fanged cat, lapped at his blood. It had always been in his stars. The way things were, he would sooner or later have been tapped by a vampire. He was luckier than most, to have given blood freely rather than be drained by force. He had certainly been more fortunate than Penelope. \u0027Charles,\u0027 Florence Stoker said, \u0027I\u0027ve been running on for close to an hour, and I declare you\u0027ve not heard a single word. It\u0027s plain from your face that your thoughts are in the sickroom. With Penelope.\u0027 Oddly guilty, he let Florence continue in her belief. After all, he should be thinking of his fiancee. They were in the drawing room, awkwardly superfluous. Florence consumed cup after tiny cup of tea. Mrs Churchward occasionally darted in with a noncommittal report and Mrs Yeovil, the housekeeper, would regularly appear with more tea. But, absorbed in his own thoughts, he paid them no mind. Genevieve had taken blood from him, but given something of herself in return. She ran and turned about like quicksilver in his mind. Penelope was attended by Dr Ravna, the specialist in nervous disorders. A vampire, he had a reputation in the field of diseases of the un-dead. Dr Ravna was with the invalid now, attempting some treatment. Beauregard had been in his daze for two nights and had neglected his duties in Whitechapel. Penelope\u0027s infirmity provided an excuse but an excuse was all it was. He could not stop thinking of Genevieve. He was afraid he wanted her to drink from him again. Not the simple thirst-slaking of an opened wrist but the full embrace of the Dark Kiss. Genevieve was an extraordinary woman by the standards of any age. Together, they could live through the centuries. It was a temptation. \u0027I suppose the wedding will have to be cancelled,\u0027 Florence said. \u0027A great pity.\u0027 There had been no possibility of a formal discussion, but Beauregard assumed his engagement to Penelope was now at an end. It would be best if lawyers could be kept out of it. There was no real fault on either part, he hoped, but neither he nor Penelope was the person they had been when they entered into their understanding. With all the other troubles, the last thing he needed was a suit for breach of promise. It was hardly likely, but Mrs Churchward was old-fashioned and might consider that her daughter had been insulted. Genevieve\u0027s lips had been cool, her touch gentle, her tongue roughly pleasant as a cat\u0027s. The draining of his blood, so slow and so tender, had been an exquisite sensation, instantly addictive. He wondered what she was doing just now. \u0027I cannot understand what Lord Godalming was thinking of,\u0027 Florence continued. \u0027He has acted most peculiarly.\u0027 \u0027How unlike Art.\u0027 A screech sounded through the ceiling, barely human, followed by a whimper. Florence cringed and Beauregard\u0027s heart contracted. Penelope was in pain. The Jack the Ripper business was dragging on without fruit. The faith expressed in his abilities as an investigative agent by the Diogenes Club and the Limehouse Ring might well be misplaced. He had, after all, accomplished little. A personal note of apology had arrived from the Professor, informing him that Colonel Moran had been severely reprimanded for his interference. Also there had been a peculiar missive in green ink on thin parchment, informing him that Mr Yam, whom he took to be the Chinese elder, would no longer be inconveniencing Mlle Dieudonne. Apparently, a commission had been undertaken, but the Lord of Strange Deaths no longer felt obliged to carry it out. Beauregard made a connection with a news item buried in the pages of The Times. A singular invasion, a burglary-in-reverse, had occurred at the home of Dr Jekyll. Apparently, an unknown person effected an entry into his laboratory and scattered fifty gold sovereigns over the ashes of the elder vampire that the scientist had been examining. \u0027Sometimes I wish I had never heard of vampires,\u0027 Florence said. \u0027I told Bram as much.\u0027 Beauregard mumbled some assent. The doorbell rang and he heard Mrs Yeovil scuttling past the room to admit the caller. \u0027Another well-wisher, I should think.\u0027 Yesterday, Kate Reed, Penelope\u0027s new-born journalist friend, had come by and loitered in embarrassed impotence for half an hour, mumbling sympathetically, then found an excuse to dash off somewhere. She had hardly set Penelope a good example. The front door was pulled open, and a familiar voice explained: \u0027I don\u0027t have a card, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 Genevieve. He was on his feet and in the hallway before he could think, Florence trailing after him. She stood on the doorstep. \u0027Charles,\u0027 she said. \u0027I assumed I would find you here.\u0027 She stepped past Mrs Yeovil and slipped off her green cloak. The housekeeper hung it up. \u0027Charles,\u0027 Florence prompted. \u0027You are being remiss.\u0027 He apologised and made an introduction. Genevieve, on her best behaviour, touched Florence\u0027s hand and made a passable curtsey. Mrs Churchward was in the hallway now, come down to investigate the new arrival. Beauregard made a further introduction. \u0027I understand you are in need of a doctor familiar with infirmities of the un-dead,\u0027 Genevieve explained to Penelope\u0027s mother. \u0027I have not a little experience.\u0027 \u0027Dr Ravna of Harley Street is with us, Miss Dieudonne. I should think his services sufficient.\u0027 \u0027Ravna?\u0027 Her face betrayed her opinion. \u0027Genevieve?\u0027 he asked. \u0027There\u0027s no polite way of saying it, Charles. Ravna is a crank and a buffoon. He\u0027s been a vampire six months, and already he\u0027s declared himself the Calmet of the age. You\u0027d be better off with Jekyll or Moreau, and I wouldn\u0027t trust them to lance a boil.\u0027 \u0027Dr Ravna comes most highly recommended,\u0027 Mrs Churchward insisted. \u0027He is welcome in all the best houses.\u0027 Genevieve waved that aside. \u0027Society has been known to make mistakes.\u0027 \u0027I hardly think...\u0027 \u0027Mrs Churchward, you must let me see your daughter.\u0027 She fixed her eyes on Penelope\u0027s mother. Beauregard felt the persuasive force of her glance. The wound on his wrist tickled. He was sure everyone noticed how often he fidgeted with his cuff. \u0027Very well,\u0027 Mrs Churchward said. \u0027Think of it as a second opinion,\u0027 Genevieve said. Leaving Florence and Mrs Yeovil behind, Genevieve and Beauregard followed Mrs Churchward upstairs. When Mrs Churchward opened the sick-room door, a dreadful odour seeped out. It was the smell of things dead and forgotten. The room was heavily-curtained, a single fishtail gaslight casting a pale half-circle on the bed. Dr Ravna, sleeves rolled up, was bending over the patient, taking a set of tongs to a wriggling black thing fastened to her chest. The bedclothes were rolled back, and Penelope\u0027s chemise was open. A half-dozen black streaks were fixed to her breast and belly. \u0027Leeches,\u0027 Genevieve exclaimed. Beauregard swallowed his nausea. \u0027You damned fool!\u0027 Genevieve pushed the specialist aside and laid her hand on Penelope\u0027s brow. The patient\u0027s skin was yellowish and shiny. She was red around the eyes and angry marks dotted her exposed body. \u0027The impure blood must be drawn out,\u0027 Dr Ravna explained. \u0027She has drunk from a poison well.\u0027 Genevieve pulled off her gloves. She plucked a leech from Penelope\u0027s chest and dropped it into a basin. Working methodically and without distaste, she detached all the sluglike things. Bloodspots welled where their mouths had been. Dr Ravna began to protest, but Genevieve stared him silent. When the job was done, she rolled up the bedspread, and tucked it around Penelope\u0027s neck. \u0027Fools like you have much to answer for,\u0027 she told Dr Ravna. \u0027My credentials are of the finest, young lady.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not young,\u0027 she said. Penelope was conscious but apparently unable to speak. Her eyes darted and her hand took Genevieve\u0027s. Even ignoring the obvious symptoms of her illness, Penelope was different. Her face had changed subtly, her hairline shifted. She looked like Pamela. \u0027I just hope your leeches haven\u0027t destroyed her mind utterly,\u0027 Genevieve told Dr Ravna. \u0027She was already sick and you\u0027ve dangerously weakened her.\u0027 \u0027Is there anything that can be done?\u0027 Mrs Churchward asked. \u0027She needs blood,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027If she\u0027s drunk tainted blood, she needs good blood to counteract it. Draining her veins is worse than useless. Without blood, the brain is starved. Maybe irreparably injured.\u0027 Charles unfastened his cuff. \u0027No,\u0027 Genevieve said, waving his unspoken offer away. \u0027Your blood won\u0027t do.\u0027 She was firm on the point. Beauregard wondered whether her motives were entirely medical. \u0027She needs her own blood, or something close. What Moreau says is true. There are differing types of blood. Vampires have known that for centuries.\u0027 \u0027Her own blood?\u0027 Mrs Churchward said. \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027Or something close, the blood of a relative. Mrs Churchward, would you be willing...\u0027 Mrs Churchward could not conceal her disgust. \u0027You nursed her once,\u0027 Genevieve explained. \u0027Now you must do it again.\u0027 Penelope\u0027s mother was horror-struck. Her hands were held to her face, wrists crossed over her throat. \u0027If Lord Godalming were truly a gentleman, this would not be necessary,\u0027 Genevieve told Beauregard. Penelope hissed, eye-teeth bared. She sucked at the air, tongue out to catch whatever sustenance there was. \u0027Your daughter will live,\u0027 Genevieve told Mrs Churchward. \u0027But everything that makes her who she is could be washed away and you would be left with a blank, a creature of appetites but no mind.\u0027 \u0027She looks like Pamela,\u0027 Beauregard said. Genevieve was concerned. \u0027Damn, that\u0027s bad. Penelope is shrinking inside, reshaping herself, losing herself.\u0027 Penelope whimpered and Beauregard blinked away tears. The smell, the stifling heat of the room, the cowed doctor, the patient in pain. All were too familiar. Mrs Churchward approached the bed. Genevieve beckoned her and took her hand. She brought mother and daughter together, and slipped away from them. Penelope reached up and embraced her mother. Mrs Churchward pulled her collar away from her throat, quivering with distaste. The patient sat up in bed and attached her mouth to her mother\u0027s neck. A shock froze Mrs Churchward. A red trickle coursed down Penelope\u0027s chin on to her night-dress. Genevieve sat on the bed and stroked Penelope\u0027s hair, cooing encouragement. \u0027Careful,\u0027 she said, \u0027not too much.\u0027 Dr Ravna retreated, leaving behind his leeches. Beauregard felt like an intruder, but remained. Mrs Churchward\u0027s expression softened and a certain dreaminess crept into her eyes. Beauregard understood how she felt. He gripped his wrist tight, sliding the stiff linen of his cuff over the bitemarks. Genevieve eased Penelope away from her mother\u0027s neck and settled her back on to her pillows. Her lips were scarlet, her face ruddy. She seemed fuller, more like her old self. \u0027Charles,\u0027 Genevieve said sharply. \u0027Stop dreaming.\u0027 Mrs Churchward was tottering on the verge of a faint. Beauregard caught her and helped her into a chair. \u0027I never... thought...\u0027 she said. \u0027Poor, poor Penny.\u0027 She understood her daughter better now, Beauregard knew. \u0027Penelope,\u0027 Genevieve said, trying to get the invalid\u0027s attention. Penelope\u0027s eyes wandered and her mouth trembled. She licked away the last of the blood. \u0027Miss Churchward, can you hear me?\u0027 Penelope purred an answer. \u0027You must rest,\u0027 Genevieve told her. Penelope nodded, smiled and allowed her eyes to flutter shut. Genevieve turned to Mrs Churchward and snapped her fingers in front of her face. Penelope\u0027s mother was jolted from her daydream. \u0027Two days from now, the same, you understand? With supervision. You must not let your daughter take too much blood from you. And that must be the last time. She must not become dependent on you. Another feeding will bring her up to strength. Then, she must fend for herself.\u0027 \u0027Will she live?\u0027 Mrs Churchward asked. \u0027I can\u0027t promise an eternity, but if she\u0027s careful she should survive the century. Perhaps the millennium.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-45.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
