Even the short stroll from Caversham Street to Cheyne Walk had chilled him to the bone. Bairstow had set the fire earlier and the room was warm and welcoming.\\n\\n Genevieve wandered around the room like a cat getting acquainted with a new home, alighting on this and that and examining, almost tasting, an object, before replacing it, sometimes making a slight adjustment to a position.\\n\\n \u0027This was Pamela?\u0027 she said, holding up the last photograph. \u0027She was beautiful.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard agreed.\\n\\n \u0027Many women wouldn\u0027t care to be photographed when they were with child,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027It might seem indecent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pamela was not like many women.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t doubt it, to judge by her influence on her survivors.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard remembered.\\n\\n \u0027She didn\u0027t wish you to give up the rest of your life, though,\u0027 she said, setting the picture down. \u0027And she certainly did not want her cousin to reshape herself in her image.\u0027\\n\\n Beauregard had no answer. Genevieve made him see his late engagement in an unhealthy light. Neither Penelope nor he had been honest with themselves or each other. But he could not blame Penelope, or Mrs Churchward, or Florence Stoker. It had all been his own fault.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s gone is gone,\u0027 Genevieve continued. \u0027I should know. I\u0027ve buried centuries.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment she bent over and did a comic impersonation of a shaking dowager. Then she straightened and brushed a wave of hair away from her forehead.\\n\\n \u0027What will happen to Penelope?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n She shrugged. \u0027There are no guarantees. I believe she will survive, and I think she will be herself again. Maybe she will be herself for the first time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t like her, do you?\u0027\\n\\n She stopped her wandering and cocked her head in thought. \u0027Perhaps I\u0027m jealous.\u0027 Her tongue passed over her bright teeth and he realised she was closer to him than modesty recommended. \u0027Then again, perhaps she isn\u0027t very nice. That night in Whitechapel, after I had been hurt, she didn\u0027t strike me as entirely sympathetic. Lips too thin, eyes too sharp.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you realise how great a thing it was for her to come to such a quarter? To seek me out. It ran against everything she had been taught, everything she believed about herself.\u0027\\n\\n He still found it hard to credit that the old Penelope had ventured out by herself, let alone travelled to a place she must have viewed as in the neighbourhood of the pits of Abaddon.\\n\\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t want you any more,\u0027 she said, bluntly.\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027ll be incapable of being a good little wife now she\u0027s new-born. She\u0027ll have to find her own way in the night. She might have the makings of a very fine vampire, for what that\u0027s worth.\u0027 Her hand was on his lapel, sharp nails resting against the material. The heat from the fire made him almost uncomfortable. \u0027Come on and kiss me, Charles.\u0027\\n\\n He hesitated.\\n\\n She smiled, her even teeth almost normal. \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 she said. \u0027I won\u0027t bite.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Liar.\u0027\\n\\n She giggled and he touched his mouth to hers. Her arms slipped tight around him. Her tongue ran over his lips. They moved away from the fire, and, not without some awkwardness, settled on a divan. His hand slid into her hair.\\n\\n \u0027Are you seducing me, or am I seducing you?\u0027 she said. \u0027I forget which.\u0027\\n\\n She was amusing at the strangest times, he noticed. His thumb felt the nap of her cheek. She kissed his wrist, touching her tongue to the healed-over bites. A jolt ran through him. He felt it most in the soles of his feet.\\n\\n \u0027Does it matter?\u0027\\n\\n She pressed his head down into a cushion, so he could see the ceiling, and kissed his neck.\\n\\n \u0027This may not be the love-making you are used to,\u0027 she said. Her teeth were sharper now, and longer.\\n\\n Her chemise was free of her skirt and undone. She had a pretty, slim shape. His clothes were loose, too.\\n\\n \u0027I could say as much to you.\u0027\\n\\n She laughed, a full-throated man\u0027s laugh, and nipped his neck, hair falling in front of her face, wisping over his mouth and nose, tickling. His hands worked under her chemise, up and down her back and shoulders. He felt the vampire strength of the muscles sliding under her skin. She picked the studs out of his collar and shirtfront with her teeth and spat them away. He imagined Bairstow finding them one by one over the next month and laughed.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s funny?\u0027\\n\\n He shook his head and she kissed him again, on the mouth, eyes and neck. He was aware of the pulsing of his blood. Gradually, between caresses, they divested each other of the four or five layers of clothing deemed proper.\\n\\n \u0027If you think this a Herculean labour,\u0027 she said as he discovered yet another set of hooks on the thigh of her skirt, \u0027you should have tried to court a high-born lady in the late fifteenth century. It is a miracle my generation have any descendants at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Things are easier in hotter climates.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Easier does not always mean more pleasant.\u0027\\n\\n They lay together, warmed by their bodies.\\n\\n \u0027You have scars,\u0027 she said, following the slice-mark under his ribs with a fingernail.\\n\\n \u0027The service of the Queen.\u0027\\n\\n She found the two bullet-wounds in his right shoulder, entry and exit, and tongued the long-healed pockmark under his collarbone.\\n\\n \u0027What exactly is it that you do for Her Majesty?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Somewhere between diplomacy and war there is the Diogenes Club.\u0027\\n\\n He kissed her breasts, his own teeth pressing delicately into her skin.\\n\\n \u0027You have no scars at all. Not so much as a birthmark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For me, everything heals on the outside.\u0027\\n\\n Her skin was pale and clear, almost but not quite hairless. She adjusted her position to make it easier for him. She bit her full underlip as he gently settled his weight on to her.\\n\\n \u0027There now,\u0027 she said. \u0027At last.\u0027\\n\\n He sighed slowly as they slipped together. She held him tight with her legs and arms and reached up with her head, attaching her mouth to his neck.\\n\\n Icy needles shocked him and, for a moment, he was in her body in her mind. The extent of her was astonishing. Her memory receded into the dim distance like the course of a star in a far galaxy. He felt himself moving inside her, tasted his own blood on her tongue. Then he was himself again, shuddering.\\n\\n \u0027Stop me, Charles,\u0027 she said, red drops between her teeth. \u0027Stop me if it hurts.\u0027\\n\\n He shook his head. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-47.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \\n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
