A pompous, middle-aged politician, Genevieve understood him to be unpopular. Unlike a High Court judge, he had no gavel and so was forced to slap his wooden desk with an open hand. \u0027Any further interruptions of this nature,\u0027 Baxter said, glaring, \u0027and I shall be forced to clear the public from the room.\u0027 The surly rough, who must have looked hungry even when warm, slouched back to his bench. He was surrounded by a similar crew. She knew the type: long scarves, ragged coats, pockets distended by books, heavy boots and thin beards. Whitechapel had all manner of Republican, anarchist, socialist and insurrectionist factions. \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said the coroner ironically, rearranging his notes. The troublemaker bared his fangs and muttered. New-borns disliked situations where someone warm had the authority. But a lifetime of cringing when officials frowned left habits. This was the second day of the inquest. Yesterday, Genevieve had sat at the back of the Hall while sundry witnesses gave testimony relating to Lulu Sch?n\u0027s origins and movements. She had been out of the ordinary among East End streetwalkers. Countess Geschwitz, a mannish vampire who claimed to have come from Germany with the girl, blurted out something of Lulu\u0027s history: a procession of acquired names, dubious associations and dead husbands. If born with a real name, no one knew it. According to a telegraph from Berlin, the German police still wanted to talk to her in connection with the shooting of one of her more recent husbands. All the witnesses - including Geschwitz, who had turned her - were transparently in love with Lulu, or at least desired her beyond all reason. Evidently the new-born could have been one of les Grandes Horizontales of Europe, but foolishness and ill fortune had reduced her to fourpenny knee-tremblers in London\u0027s meaner streets and finally delivered her to the sharp mercies of Silver Knife. Throughout the testimony, Lestrade muttered about opening up Pandora\u0027s Box. It was almost certain the only connection between the Whitechapel Murderer and his victims came at the point of their deaths, but the police investigation could not afford to overlook the possibility that these were pre-meditated killings of specific women. Back in Commercial Street, Abberline, Thick and the others were assembling and cross-referencing biographies, more exhaustively detailed than any life of a great statesman, of Nichols, Chapman and Sch?n. If any connection could be established between the women, beyond the fact that they were all vampire prostitutes, then that might lead to their killer. As the inquest, commenced in the early afternoon, proceeded into the evening, Baxter had turned his attention to Sch?n\u0027s doings on the night of her death. Geschwitz, face red from a recent feeding, said Lulu had left their attic some time between three and four in the morning. The body had been discovered by Constable George Neve, walking his beat shortly after six. After finishing Lulu, presumably in plain sight on Chicksand Street, the murderer had dumped her on the doorstep of a basement flat. A family of Polish Jews, of whom only the littlest child could speak anything approaching English, had been inside. They all stated, as translated by the tiny girl after a Yiddish babel of argument, not to have heard anything until Constable Neve roused them by practically battering down their door. Rebecca Kosminksi, the self-assured spokeswoman, was the only vampire in the family. Genevieve had seen her kind before; Melissa d\u0027Acques, who had turned Chandagnac, was one. Rebecca might live to become the all-powerful matriarch of her extended clan, but she would never grow up. Lestrade fidgeted throughout, describing it cruelly as \u0027comedy relief \u0027. He would rather have been out combing the crime scene than sitting on a hardwood bench made for the tough bottoms and short legs of twelve-year-olds, but he could not get in Fred Abberline\u0027s way too often. He gloomily told Genevieve that Baxter was known for the length of his inquests. The coroner\u0027s approach was characterised by an obsessive, not to say tedious, insistence on dragging out irrelevant details and the flamboyant off-handedness of his summings-up. In his closing remarks on Anne Chapman, Baxter had invented the theory, on the basis of gossip overheard at the Middlesex Hospital, that an American doctor was either the murderer or the employer of the murderer. The unknown doctor, researching the physiognomy of the un-dead, was rumoured to have offered twenty guineas for a fresh vampire heart. There had been a brief flurry of activity as Abberline tried to locate the foreigner, but it turned out vampire hearts, mainly somewhat damaged, could be unethically purchased from mortuaries for as little as sixpence. Baxter had adjourned before midnight, and reconvened the inquest this morning. Now evidence from the post-mortem was available, and today\u0027s business mainly concerned a succession of medical men, all of whom had crammed themselves into Whitechapel Workhouse Infirmary Mortuary to examine the mortal remains of Lulu Sch?n. First came Dr George Bagster Phillips, the H Division Police Surgeon - well known at Toynbee Hall - who had done the preliminary examination of the body in Chicksand Street and performed the more detailed post-mortem. It boiled down to the simple facts that Lulu Sch?n had been heart-stabbed, disembowelled and decapitated. It took much desk-banging to quieten the outrage that followed these not unexpected revelations. By law, inquests had to be held in public places and be open to the press. From the several appearances Genevieve had made as a witness in connection with the deaths of paupers in Toynbee Hall beds, she knew the only audience was usually a bored stringer from the Central News Agency, with the occasional friend or relation of the deceased. But the lecture hall was even more thickly populated today than it had been yesterday, the benches as heavily burdened as if Con Donovan were on the stage, rematching with Monk for the Featherweight Title. Aside from the reporters hogging the front row, Genevieve noticed a gaggle of haggard mainly un-dead women in colourful dresses, a scattering of well-dressed men, some of Lestrade\u0027s uniformed juniors, and a sprinkling of sensation-seekers, clergymen and social reformers. In the centre of the room, spaces all around unoccupied despite the surplus of attendees, sat a long-haired vampire warrior. Not a new-born, he wore the uniform, including a steel breastplate, of the Prince Consort\u0027s Own Carpathian Guard, augmented by a tasselled fez. His face was withered white parchment but his eyes, blood-red marbles set in the dead waste of skin, constantly twitched. \u0027Do you know who that is?\u0027 Lestrade asked. Genevieve did. \u0027Kostaki, one of Vlad Tepes\u0027s hangers-on.\u0027 \u0027That sort gives me the creeps,\u0027 commented the new-born detective. \u0027The elders.\u0027 Genevieve almost laughed. Kostaki was younger than she. His presence was almost certainly not due to mere curiosity. The Palace was taking an interest in Silver Knife. \u0027People die every night in Whitechapel, in ways Vlad Tepes couldn\u0027t devise, or live lives worse than any death,\u0027 Genevieve said, \u0027yet from one year\u0027s end to the next, London pretends we\u0027re as remote as Borneo. But give them a handful of gory murders and you can\u0027t move for sightseers and prurient philanthropists.\u0027 \u0027Maybe some good will come of it,\u0027 Lestrade commented. Dr Bagster Phillips was thanked and dismissed, and Baxter called for Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.CL., LL.D., F.R.S., etc. A dignified, smooth-faced man of fifty, obviously once handsome, approached the lectern and took the oath. \u0027Whenever a vampire\u0027s killed,\u0027 Lestrade explained, \u0027Jekyll comes creeping round. Something rum about him, if you get my drift...\u0027 The scientific researcher, who first gave a detailed and anatomically precise description of the atrocities, was warm only in the sense that he was not a vampire. Dr Jekyll was self-controlled to a point that suggested a disturbing lack of empathy with the human subject of the inquest, but Genevieve listened with interest - certainly more than that expressed by the yawning reporters in the front row - to the comments Baxter solicited from him. \u0027We have not learned enough about the precise changes in the human metabolism that accompany the so-called \"turn\" from normal life to the un-dead state. Precise information is hard to come by, and superstition hangs like a London fog over the subject. My studies have been checked by official indifference, even hostility. We could all benefit from research. Perhaps the divisions which lead to tragic incidents like the death of this girl could then be erased from our society.\u0027 The anarchists were grumbling again. Without divisions, their cause would have no purpose. \u0027Too much of what we believe about vampirism is sheer folklore,\u0027 Dr Jekyll continued. \u0027The stake through the heart, the silver scythe. The vampire corpus is remarkably resilient, but any major breach of the vital organs seems to produce true death, as here.\u0027 Baxter hummed and questioned the doctor. \u0027So the murderer has not, in your opinion, followed what we might deem the standard superstitious practice of the vampire killer?\u0027 \u0027Indeed. I should like to put certain facts into the record, if only to provide a definitive contradiction of irresponsible journalism.\u0027 Some of the reporters hooted quietly. A lightning sketch artist sitting in directly in front of Genevieve was deftly portraying Dr Jekyll for reproduction in the illustrated press. He pencilled in some dark shadows under the witness\u0027s eyes to make him look more untrustworthy. \u0027As with Nichols and Chapman, Sch?n was not penetrated with a wooden stake or paling. Her mouth was not stuffed with cloves of garlic, or fragments of communion wafer, or pages torn from a sacred text. No crucifix or cruciform object was found on or near the body. The dampness of her skirts and the residue of water on her face were almost certainly condensation from the fog. It is highly unlikely that the body was sprinkled with holy water.\u0027 The artist, probably the man from the Police Gazette, drew in heavy eyebrows and tried to make Dr Jekyll\u0027s thick but immaculately combed hair look shaggy. He went too far in distorting his subject and, tutting at his overenthusiasm, tore the sheet off his pad, crumpled it into his pocket, and began afresh. Baxter jotted down some notes, and resumed his questioning. \u0027Would you venture that the murderer was familiar with the workings of the human body, whether of a vampire or not?\u0027 \u0027Yes, coroner. The extent of the injuries betokens a certain frenzy of enthusiasm, but the actual wounds - one might almost say incisions - have been wrought with some skill.\u0027 \u0027Silver Knife\u0027s a bleedin\u0027 doctor,\u0027 shouted the chief anarchist. The court again exploded into uproar. The anarchists, about half-and-half warm and new-borns, stamped their feet and yelled, while others talked loudly among themselves. Kostaki looked around and silenced a pair of clergymen with a cold glare. Baxter hurt his hand hitting his desk. Genevieve noticed a man standing at the back of the courtroom observing the clamour with cool interest. Well-dressed, with a cloak and top hat, he might have been a sensation-seeker but for a certain air of purpose. He was not a vampire, but - unlike the coroner, or even Dr Henry Jekyll - he showed no signs of being disturbed to be among so many of the un-dead. He leant on a black cane. \u0027Who is that?\u0027 she asked Lestrade. \u0027Charles Beauregard,\u0027 the new-born detective said, curling a lip. \u0027Have you heard of the Diogenes Club?\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027When they say \"high places\", that\u0027s where they mean. Important people are taking an interest in this case. And Beauregard is their catspaw.\u0027 \u0027A striking man.\u0027 \u0027If you say so, mademoiselle.\u0027 The coroner had restored order again. A clerk had nipped out of the room and returned with six more constables, all new-borns. They lined the walls like an honour guard. The anarchists were brooding again, their purpose obviously to cause enough trouble to be an irritant but not enough to get their names noted. \u0027If I might be permitted to address the implied question raised by the gentleman,\u0027 Dr Jekyll asked, eliciting a nod from Baxter, \u0027a knowledge of the position of the major organs does not necessarily betoken a medical education. If you are disinterested in preserving life, a butcher can have out a pair of kidneys as neatly as a surgeon. You need only a steady hand and a sharp knife, and there are plenty of both in Whitechapel.\u0027 \u0027Do you have an opinion as to the instrument used by the murderer?\u0027 \u0027A blade of some sort, obviously. Silvered.\u0027 The word brought a collective gasp. \u0027Steel or iron would not have done such damage,\u0027 Dr Jekyll continued. \u0027Vampire physiology is such that wounds inflicted with ordinary weapons heal almost immediately. Tissue and bone regenerate, just as a lizard may grow a new tail. Silver has a counteractive effect on this process. Only silver could do such permanent, fatal harm to a vampire. In this instance, the popular imagination, which has tagged the murderer as \"Silver Knife\", has almost certainly got its facts straight.\u0027 \u0027You are familiar with the cases of Mary Ann Nichols and Eliza Anne Chapman?\u0027 asked Baxter. Dr Jekyll nodded. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Have you drawn any conclusions from a comparison of these incidents?\u0027 \u0027Indeed. These three killings are indubitably the work of the same individual. A left-handed man of above average height, with more than normal physical strength...\u0027 \u0027Mr Holmes would\u0027ve been able to tell his mother\u0027s maiden name from a fleck of cigar ash,\u0027 Lestrade muttered. \u0027... I would add that, considering the case from an alienist\u0027s point of view, it is my belief that the murderer is not himself a vampire.\u0027 The anarchist was on his feet but the coroner\u0027s extra constables were around him before he could even shout. Smiling to himself at his subjugation of the court, Baxter made a note of the last point and thanked Dr Jekyll. Genevieve noticed that the man she had asked Lestrade about was gone. She wondered if Beauregard noticed her as she had noticed him. From her side, a connection had been made. She was either having one of her \u0027insights\u0027 or had gone too long without feeding. No, she was certain. The man from the Diogenes Club - whatever that really was - was materially involved in the affairs of the Whitechapel Murderer, but she could not guess in what capacity. The coroner began his elaborate summing-up, delivering the verdict of \u0027wilful murder by person or persons unknown\u0027, adding that the killer of Lulu Sch?n was judged to be the same man who had murdered, on 31st of August, Mary Ann Nichols, and, on 8th of September, Eliza Anne Chapman.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-6.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
