Meat and bone against wood.\\n\\n In her dreams, Genevieve had returned to the days of her girlhood in the France of the Spider King, la Pucelle and the monster Gilles. When warm, she had been the physician\u0027s daughter not Chandagnac\u0027s get. Before she turned, before the Dark Kiss...\\n\\n Her tongue felt sleep-filmed teeth. The aftertang of her own blood was in her mouth, disgusting and mildly exciting.\\n\\n In her dreams, the pounding was a mallet striking the end of a snapped-in-half quarterstaff. The English captain finished her father-in-darkness like a butterfly, pinning Chandagnac to the bloodied earth. One of the less memorable skirmishes of the Hundred Years\u0027 War. Barbarous times she had hoped deservedly dead.\\n\\n The hammering continued. She opened her eyes and tried to focus on the grubby glass of the skylight. The sun was not yet quite down. Dreams washed away in an instant and she was awake, as if a gallon of icy water were dashed into her face.\\n\\n The hammering paused. \u0027Mademoiselle Dieudonne,\u0027 someone shouted. It was not the director - usually responsible for urgent calls that dragged her from sleep - but she recognised the voice. \u0027Open up. Scotland Yard.\u0027\\n\\n She sat, sheet falling away. She slept on the floor in her underclothes, on a blanket laid over the rough planks.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s been another Silver Knife murder.\u0027\\n\\n She had been resting in her tiny office at Toynbee Hall. It was as safe a place as any to pass the few days each month when lassitude overcame her and she shared the sleep of the dead. Up high in the building, the room had only a tiny skylight and the door could be secured from the inside. It served, as coffins and crypts served for those of the Prince Consort\u0027s bloodline.\\n\\n She gave a placatory grunt and the hammering was not resumed. She cleared her throat. Her body, unused for days, creaked as she stretched. A cloud obscured the sun and the pain momentarily eased. She stood up in the dark and ran her hands over her hair. The cloud passed and her strength ebbed.\\n\\n \u0027Mademoiselle?\u0027\\n\\n The hammering started again. The young were always impatient. She had once been the same.\\n\\n She took a Chinese silk robe from a hook and drew it about herself. Not the dress etiquette recommended to entertain a gentleman caller, but it would have to do. Etiquette, so important a few short years ago, meant less and less. They were sleeping in earth-lined coffins in Mayfair, and hunting in packs on Pall Mall. This season, the correct form of address for an archbishop was hardly of major concern to anyone.\\n\\n As she slid back the bolt, traces of her sleep-fog persisted. Outside the afternoon was dying; she would not be at her best until night was about her again. She pulled open her door. A stocky new-born stood in the corridor, long coat around him like a cloak, bowler hat shifting from hand to hand.\\n\\n \u0027Surely, Lestrade, you are not of the kind that needs to be invited into any new dwelling?\u0027 Genevieve enquired. \u0027That would be very inconvenient for a man in your profession. Well, come in, come in...\u0027\\n\\n She admitted the Scotland Yard man. Jagged teeth stuck from his mouth, unconcealed by a half-grown moustache. When warm, he had been rat-faced; the sparse whiskers completed the resemblance. His ears were shifting, becoming high and pointed. Like most new-borns of the bloodline of the Prince Consort, he had not yet found his final form. He wore smoked glasses but crimson points behind the lenses suggested active eyes.\\n\\n He set his hat down upon her desk.\\n\\n \u0027Last night,\u0027 he began, hurriedly, \u0027in Chicksand Street. It was butchery.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Last night?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he drew breath, making an allowance for her spell of rest. \u0027It\u0027s the seventeenth now. Of September.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been asleep three days.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve opened her wardrobe and considered the few clothes hanging inside. She hardly had costume for every occasion. It was unlikely, all considered, that she would in the near future be invited to a reception at the Palace. Her only remaining jewellery was her father\u0027s tiny crucifix, and she rarely wore that for fear of upsetting some sensitive new-born with silly ideas.\\n\\n \u0027I deemed it best to rouse you. Everyone is jittery. Feelings are running high.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were quite right,\u0027 she said. She rubbed sleep-gum from her eyes. Even the last shards of sunlight, filtered through a grimy square of glass, were icicles jammed into her forehead.\\n\\n \u0027When the sun is down,\u0027 Lestrade was saying, \u0027there\u0027ll be pandemonium. It could be another Bloody Sunday. Some say Van Helsing has returned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Prince Consort would love that.\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade shook his head. \u0027It\u0027s merely a rumour. Van Helsing is dead. His head remains on its spike.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve checked?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Palace is always under guard. The Prince Consort has his Carpathians about him. Our kind cannot be too careful. We have many enemies.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our kind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The un-dead.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve almost laughed. \u0027I am not your kind, Inspector. You are of the bloodline of Vlad Tepes, I am of the bloodline of Chandagnac. We are at best cousins.\u0027\\n\\n The detective shrugged and snorted at the same time. Bloodline meant little to the vampires of London, Genevieve knew. Even at a third, a tenth or a twentieth remove, they all had Vlad Tepes as father-in-darkness.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027A new-born named Sch?n. Lulu. Common prostitute, like the others.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is... what, the fourth?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No one is sure. The sensation press have exhumed every unsolved East End killing of the past thirty years to lay at the door of the Whitechapel Murderer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How many are the police certain of?\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade snorted. \u0027We\u0027ll not even be certain of Sch?n until the inquest, although I\u0027ll stake my pension on her. I\u0027ve come direct from the mortuary. The trade marks are unmistakable. Otherwise, Annie Chapman last week and Polly Nichols the week before. Opinions differ on a couple of others. Emma Smith, Martha Tabram.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you think?\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade nibbled his lip. \u0027Just the three. At least, the three we know of. Smith was set upon, robbed and impaled by roughs from the Jago. Violated, too. Typical rip-mob assault, nothing like our man\u0027s work. And Tabram was warm. Silver Knife is only interested in us. In vampires.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve understood.\\n\\n \u0027This man hates,\u0027 Lestrade continued, \u0027hates with a passion. The murders must be committed in a frenzy, yet there\u0027s a coolness to them. He kills out on the street in broad darkness. He doesn\u0027t just butcher, he dissects. And vampires aren\u0027t easy to kill. Our man is not a simple lunatic. He has a reason.\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade took the crimes personally. The Whitechapel Murderer cut deep. New-borns were jerked this way and that by misunderstanding, cringing from the crucifix because of a folk tale they half-knew.\\n\\n \u0027Has the news travelled?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fast,\u0027 the detective told her. \u0027The evening editions carry the story. It\u0027ll be all over London by now. There are those among the warm who do not love us, Mademoiselle. They\u0027re rejoicing. When the new-borns come out, there could be a panic. I\u0027ve suggested troops, but Warren is leery. After that business last year...\u0027\\n\\n She remembered. Alarmed in the aftermath of the Royal Wedding by increased public disorder, Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had issued an edict against political meetings in Trafalgar Square. In defiance, warm insurrectionists, preaching against the Crown and the new government, gathered one November afternoon. William Morris and H.M. Hyndman of the Socialist Democratic Federation, with the support of Robert Cunningham-Grahame, the radical Member of Parliament, and Annie Besant, of the National Secular Society, argued for the declaration of a Republic. There was fierce, indeed violent, debate. Genevieve observed from the steps of the National Gallery. She was not the only vampire to consider aligning with the putative Republic. You did not have to be warm to take Vlad Tepes for a monster. Eleanor Marx, herself a new-born, and authoress with Dr Edward Aveling of The Vampire Question, made an impassioned speech calling for the abdication of Queen Victoria and the expulsion of the Prince Consort.\\n\\n \u0027... I can\u0027t say I blame him. Still, H Division isn\u0027t equipped for riot. The Yard has sent me over to goose the local blokes, but we\u0027ve got enough to do catching the murderer without having to fend off some scythe-and-stake mob.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve wondered which way Sir Charles would jump. In November, the Commissioner, a soldier before he was a policeman and now a vampire before he was a soldier, had sent in the army. Even before a flustered magistrate could finish reading the Riot Act, a dragoon officer ordered his men, a mixture of vampires and the warm, to clear the Square. After that charge, the Prince Consort\u0027s Own Carpathian Guards set about the crowd, doing more harm with teeth and claws than the dragoons had with fixed bayonets. There were a few fatalities and many injuries; subsequently, there were a few trials and many \u0027disappearances\u0027. November 13th, 1887, was remembered as \u0027Bloody Sunday\u0027. Genevieve spent a week in Guy\u0027s Hospital, helping with the less seriously wounded. Many spat on her or refused to be ministered to by one of her kind. Were it not for the intervention of the Queen herself, still a calming influence on her adoring subjects, the Empire could have exploded like a barrel of gunpowder.\\n\\n \u0027And what, pray, can I do,\u0027 Genevieve asked, \u0027to serve the purpose of the Prince Consort?\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade chewed his moustache, teeth glistening, flecks of froth on his lips.\\n\\n \u0027You may be needed, Mademoiselle. The Hall will be overrun. Some don\u0027t want to be out on the streets with the murderer about. Others are spreading panic and sedition, firing up vigilante mobs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not Florence Nightingale.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have influence...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do, don\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish... I would humbly request... you would use your influence to calm the situation. Before disaster occurs. Before more are unnecessarily killed.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve was not above enjoying a taste of power. She slipped off her robe, shocking the detective. Death and rebirth had not shaken out of him the prejudices of his time. Lestrade shrank behind his smoked glasses, as she swiftly dressed, fastening the seeming hundreds of small catches and buttons on her bottle-green skirt and jacket with neat movements of sharp-tipped fingers. It was as if the costume of her warm days, as intricate and cumbersome as a full suit of armour, had returned to plague her. As a new-born, she had, with relief, worn the simple tunics and trews made acceptable if not fashionable by the Maid of Orleans, vowing never again to be sewed into breath-stopping formal dress.\\n\\n The Inspector was too pale to blush properly, but penny-sized patches appeared on his cheeks and he huffed involuntarily. Lestrade, like many new-borns, treated her as if she were the age of her face. She had been sixteen when Chandagnac gave her the Dark Kiss. She was older, by a decade or more, than Vlad Tepes. While he was a warm Christian Prince, nailing Turks\u0027 turbans to their skulls and lowering his countrymen on to sharpened posts, she had been a new-born, learning the skills that now made her the longest-lived of her bloodline. With four and a half centuries behind her, it was hard not to be irritated when the fresh-risen dead, still barely cooled, patronised her.\\n\\n \u0027Silver Knife must be found and stopped,\u0027 Lestrade said. \u0027Before he kills again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indubitably,\u0027 Genevieve agreed. \u0027It sounds like an affair for your old associate, the consulting detective.\u0027\\n\\n She sensed, with the sharpened perceptions that told her night was falling, the chilling of the Inspector\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \u0027Mr Holmes is not at liberty to investigate, Mademoiselle. He has his differences with the current government.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mean he has been removed, like so many of our finest minds, to those pens on the Sussex Downs. What does the Pall Mall Gazette call them, concentration camps?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I regret his lack of vision...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where is he? Devil\u0027s Dyke?\u0027\\n\\n Lestrade nodded, almost ashamed. There was much of the man left inside. New-borns clung to their warm lives as if nothing had changed. How long would it be before they grew like the bitch vampires the Prince Consort had brought from the land beyond the forests, an appetite on legs, mindlessly preying?\\n\\n Genevieve finished her cuffs and turned to Lestrade, arms slightly out. It was a habit born of lifetimes without mirrors, always seeking an opinion on her appearance. The detective gave grudging approval. Settling a hooded cloak about her shoulders, she left her room, Lestrade following.\\n\\n In the corridor outside, gaslights were already lit. Beyond a row of windows, hanging fog purged itself of the last of the dying sun. One window was open, letting in cool air. Genevieve could taste life in it. She must feed soon, within two or three days. It was always that way after her rest.\\n\\n \u0027The Sch?n inquest commences tomorrow night,\u0027 Lestrade said, \u0027at the Working Lads\u0027 Institute. It might be best if you attended.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well, but I must first talk with the director. Someone will have to take care of my duties for the duration.\u0027\\n\\n They were on the stairs. The building was coming to life. No matter how the Prince Consort changed London, Toynbee Hall - founded by the Reverend Samuel Barnett in the name of the late philanthropist Arnold Toynbee - was still required. The poor needed shelter, sustenance, medical attention, education. The new-borns, potentially immortal destitutes, were hardly better off than their warm brothers and sisters. For many, the East End settlements were the last recourse. Genevieve felt like Sisyphus, forever rolling a rock uphill, losing a yard for every foot gained.\\n\\n On the first-floor landing sat a dark-haired little girl, a rag-doll in her lap. One of her arms was withered, leathery membranes bunched in folds beneath it, the drab dress cut away to allow freedom of movement. Lily smiled, teeth sharp but uneven.\\n\\n \u0027Gene,\u0027 Lily said, \u0027look...\u0027\\n\\n Smiling she extended the spindly arm. It grew longer, more sinewy; the hairy grey-brown flap stretched.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been working on my wings. I\u0027ll fly to the moon and back.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve looked away and saw Lestrade similarly examining the ceiling. She turned back to Lily and knelt, stroking her arm. The thick skin felt wrong, as if the muscles beneath were pulling against each other. Neither the elbow nor the wrist locked properly. Vlad Tepes could shape-shift without effort, but new-borns of his bloodline could not carry off the trick. Which didn\u0027t prevent them from trying.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll bring you some cheese,\u0027 Lily said, \u0027as a present.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve stroked Lily\u0027s hair and stood. The director\u0027s door was open. She entered, rapping a knuckle on the wood as she passed. The director was at his desk, going over a lecture time-table with Morrison, his secretary. The director was youngish and still warm, but his face was lined, his hair streaked grey. Many who\u0027d lived through the changes were like him, older than their years. Lestrade followed her into the office. The director acknowledged the detective. Morrison, a quiet young man with an interest in literature and Japanese prints, stood back in the shadows.\\n\\n \u0027Jack,\u0027 she said, \u0027Inspector Lestrade wishes me to attend an inquest tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s been another murder,\u0027 the director said, making a statement not asking a question.\\n\\n \u0027A new-born,\u0027 said Lestrade. \u0027In Chicksand Street.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lulu Sch?n,\u0027 Genevieve put in.\\n\\n \u0027Did we know her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably, but under some other name.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Arthur can go through the files,\u0027 the director said, looking at Lestrade but indicating Morrison. \u0027You\u0027ll want the details.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was she another street girl?\u0027 Morrison asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, of course,\u0027 said Genevieve. The young man looked down.\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ve had her here,\u0027 he said. \u0027One of Booth\u0027s cast-offs.\u0027\\n\\n Morrison\u0027s face screwed up as he mentioned the General\u0027s name. The Salvation Army deemed the un-dead beyond redemption, worse than other drunkards. Although warm, Morrison did not share the prejudice.\\n\\n The director\u0027s fingers drummed his desk. He looked, as usual, as if the weight of the world had just unexpectedly settled on his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Can you spare me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Druitt can take your rounds if he\u0027s back from his cricketing jaunt. And Arthur can fill in once we\u0027ve got the lecture schedules arranged. We weren\u0027t, ah, expecting you for a night or two yet anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s quite all right. Keep me informed. This is a dreadful business.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve agreed. \u0027I\u0027ll see what I can do to pacify the natives. Lestrade is expecting an uprising.\u0027\\n\\n The policeman looked shifty and embarrassed. For a moment, Genevieve felt small, teasing the new-born. She was being unfair.\\n\\n \u0027There may be something I can actually do. Talk to some of the new-born girls. Get them to take care, see if anyone knows anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well, Genevieve. Good luck. Lestrade, good evening.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dr Seward,\u0027 said the detective, putting on his hat, \u0027good night.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-2.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) \\n It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
