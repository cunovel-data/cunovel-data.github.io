{"id":109234,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"LUCY PAYS A CALL She walked with tiny steps to keep her skirts off the ground, as meticulous in her habits as any lady. Her new clothes, bought with John\u0027s money, still had a little shop-scratch about them. Few, observing her evening promenade, would recognise the Mary Jane Kelly with whom they were familiar. She felt as she had in Paris, a new-made girl free of her sad history. In Commercial Street a fine gentleman was helping a pretty vampire into a coach. Mary Jane paused to admire the couple. The gentleman was courtly without effort, his every gesture precise and perfect; and the girl was a beauty even in the mannish dress so many affected these nights, her skin a radiant white, her hair honeyed silk. The coachman lightly whipped his horse and the carriage moved off. Soon, she too would only travel in coaches. Drivers would touch their hats to her. Fine gentlemen would assist her through doors. She walked up to the doors of Toynbee Hall. The last time she had been here, her face was burned black after an accidental touch of the sun. Dr Seward, not yet her John, had examined her closely but with no interest, as if looking over a likely racehorse. He had prescribed veils and a spell indoors. Now she came not as a supplicant, but to pay a call. She tired of waiting for someone to open the doors for her and daintily pushed them inwards. She stepped into the foyer and looked about. A matron bustled through, a roll of bedding hugged to her chest. Mary Jane hemmed to attract attention. Her cough, intended as a ladylike little sound, emerged as a deep, somewhat vulgar, throat-clearing. She was embarrassed. The matron looked her in the face, lips pursed as if instantly aware of every filthy detail of Mary Jane Kelly\u0027s past. \u0027I have come to call on Dr Seward,\u0027 Mary Jane said, trying hard with every word, every syllable. The matron smiled unpleasantly. \u0027And who shall I say is calling?\u0027 Mary Jane paused, then said \u0027Miss Lucy.\u0027 \u0027Just Lucy?\u0027 Mary Jane shrugged as if her name did not matter one whit. She did not care for the matron\u0027s attitude and thought it meet she be put in her place. She was, all considered, only a kind of servant. \u0027Miss Lucy, if you would care to follow me...\u0027 The matron shoved through an inner door, and held it open with her cushion-like rump. Mary Jane passed through into a soap-smelling corridor and was led up a none-too-clean stairway. On the first-floor landing, the matron nodded towards a door. \u0027Dr Seward will be in there, Miss Lucy.\u0027 \u0027Thank you so much.\u0027 Constrained by her burden, the matron attempted a creaky and impertinent curtsey. Suppressing nasty laughter, she sloped off up another staircase, leaving the visitor alone. Mary Jane had hoped to be announced, but contented herself with taking one hand from her muff and rapping on the office door. A voice from within rumbled something indistinguishable, and Mary Jane admitted herself. John stood at a desk with another, both poring over a pile of documents. John didn\u0027t look up, but the other man - a young fellow, dressed well but not a gentleman - did, and was disappointed. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027it\u0027s not Druitt. Where can Monty have got to?\u0027 John ran his finger down a column of figures, totalling them in his head. Mary Jane knew her numbers but could never put them together: it was the root of her problem with the rent. Finally, John finished his calculation, jotted something down and raised his glance. When he saw her, it was as if someone had struck his head from behind with the blunt end of a ball-peen hammer. Unaccountable tears pricked the backs of her eyes, but she kept them in. \u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said, without expression. The young man straightened and brushed his lapels with his knuckles, presenting himself to be introduced. John shook his head as if trying to put together two mismatched halves of a broken ornament. Mary Jane wondered if she had done something terribly wrong. \u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said again. \u0027Dr Seward,\u0027 began the young man, \u0027you are being remiss.\u0027 Something inside John snapped and he began pretending everything was ordinary. \u0027Do forgive me,\u0027 he said. \u0027Morrison, this is Lucy. My... oh, a family friend.\u0027 Mr Morrison\u0027s smirk was complex, as if he understood. Mary Jane thought she had seen him before; it was possible the young man knew her for who she was. She let him take her hand and bobbed her head slightly. A mistake, she knew at once; she was a lady, not a tweeny maid. She should have let Mr Morrison raise her hand to his lips, then nodded grudgingly as if he were the lowest thing on earth and she Princess Alexandra. For such an error, Uncle Henry would have taken the rod to her. \u0027I\u0027m afraid you find me frightfully preoccupied,\u0027 John said. \u0027One of our stalwarts has gone missing,\u0027 Mr Morrison explained. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t have happened across a Montague Druitt on your travels?\u0027 The name meant nothing to her. \u0027I feared as much. I doubt that Druitt is much in your line, anyway.\u0027 Mary Jane pretended not to know at all what Mr Morrison meant. John, still taken aback, was fiddling with some doctor\u0027s implement. She began to suspect this social call to be not entirely a well-conceived endeavour. \u0027If you\u0027ll excuse me,\u0027 Mr Morrison said, \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve much to discuss. Miss Lucy, good night. Dr Seward, we\u0027ll talk later.\u0027 Mr Morrison withdrew, leaving her alone with John. When the door was firmly shut, she slipped close to him, her hands on his chest, her face by his collar, her cheek against the soft stuff of his waistcoat. \u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said, again. It was a habit of his, just to say the name out loud. He looked at Mary Jane, and saw the twice-dead girl in Kingstead. His hands touched her about the waist, then climbed her back, finally fixing at her neck. Taking a grip, he pulled her away from him. His thumbs pressed under her chin. If she were warm, this might hurt. Her teeth grew sharp. John Seward\u0027s face was dark, his expression one with which she was familiar. Sometimes, this look would pass over him when they were together. It was his brute self, the savage she found inside every man. Then, something mild sparked in his eyes and he let her go. He was shaking. He turned away and steadied himself against his desk. She smoothed the strands of her hair that had come loose, and rearranged her collar. In his rough grip, her red thirst had been aroused. \u0027Lucy, you mustn\u0027t...\u0027 He waved her away but she took a hold on him from behind, easing his collar away from his neck, undoing his stock. \u0027... be here. This is...\u0027 She wet his old scars with her tongue, then opened them with a gentle bite. \u0027... another part of...\u0027 Intently, she sucked. Her throat burned. She shut her eyes and saw red in the darkness. \u0027... my life.\u0027 Taking her mouth from his neck for a moment, she chewed her glove, biting away the tiny shell buttons at her wrist. She freed her right hand and spat out the cloth skin. Her fingers had extended, nails splitting the seams. She reached into his clothes, displacing buttons. She stroked his warm flesh, careful not to cut. John moaned to himself slightly, lost. \u0027Lucy.\u0027 The name spurred her, put anger in her appetite. She tugged at his clothes, and bit again, deeper. \u0027Lucy.\u0027 No, she thought, gripping, Mary Jane. Her chin and front were wet with his blood. She heard a choke in the back of his throat and felt him swallowing his own scream. He tried to say Lucy\u0027s name again but she worried him harder, silencing him. For the moment, in this heat, he was her John. When it was over, she would dab her lips and be his dream Lucy again. And he would rearrange his clothes and be Dr Seward. But now they were their true selves; Mary Jane and John, joined by blood and flesh.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-41.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
