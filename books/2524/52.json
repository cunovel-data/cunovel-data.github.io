{"id":109245,"no":52,"title":"Page 52","content":"THE LAST OF LUCY She was who-the-bloody-ever she wanted to be. Whoever men wanted her to be. Mary Jane Kelly. Marie Jeanette. Uncle Henry\u0027s niece. Miss Lucy. She\u0027d be Ellen Terry if it helped. John sat by her bedside. She was telling him again how she\u0027d been turned. Of the night on the heath when his precious Lucy had given the Dark Kiss. Now she told the story as if she were Lucy, and Mary Jane some other person, some worthless whore... \u0027I was so cold, John, so hungry, so new...\u0027 It was easy to know how Lucy had felt. They had both been gripped by the same soul-deep panic upon awakening from death-sleep. The same desperate, bottomless thirst. Only Lucy awoke in a crypt, respectfully laid out and mourned for. Mary Jane was on a cart, minutes away from a lime pit, jumbled in among other unclaimed bodies. \u0027She was just an Irish whore. Of no importance, John. But she was warm, plump, alive. Blood pounding in her sweet neck.\u0027 He was listening, head bobbing. She supposed he was mad. But he was a gentleman. And he was good to her, good for her. Earlier, with the strange toff, he had protected her. That madman, with his talk of Jack the Ripper, had threatened her, and John Seward fought him off. She\u0027d not expected him to be so valiant in her defence. \u0027The children hadn\u0027t been enough, John. My thirst was terrible, eating me inside.\u0027 Mary Jane had been confused by the new desires. It had taken her weeks to adjust. That time was like a dream now. She was losing Mary Jane\u0027s memories. She was Lucy. With his doctor\u0027s hand, John smoothed her shift over her breast. He was the image of the considerate lover. She\u0027d seen him from another side earlier. When he cut down the toff with a knife. His face had been different when he stabbed. John told her she was avenged, and she knew he meant Lucy. The toff had destroyed Lucy. But with his death, that part of the story was washed from John\u0027s mind. Perhaps it would come to her as she became more Lucy and less Mary Jane. As Lucy\u0027s memories seeped into her mind, Mary Jane slowly sank into a dark sea. Mary Jane had not mattered at all and she should be glad to see her so drowned. In the cold, dark depths, it would be easy for Mary Jane to fall asleep and wake up entirely as Lucy. But, her heart caught... It was hard to keep pace as things changed but it was important to make the effort. John was her best hope for escape from this poor room, from these mean streets. Eventually, she\u0027d have him keep her in a house in the better part of the city. She\u0027d have fine clothes and servants. And well-spoken children with pure, sweet blood. She was sure the toff deserved to die. He\u0027d been mad. There\u0027d been no one hiding in Miller\u0027s Court, waiting for him. Danny Dravot was not the Ripper. He was just another old soldier, full of lies about heathens he\u0027d slaughtered and brown wenches he\u0027d bedded. As Lucy, she remembered Mary Jane fearfully clutching her throat. Lucy slipped out from between the crypts. \u0027I needed her, John,\u0027 she continued. \u0027I needed her blood.\u0027 He sat by her bed, reserved and doctorly. Later, she\u0027d pleasure him. And she\u0027d drink from him. Each time she drank, she became less Mary Jane and more Lucy. It must be something in John\u0027s blood. \u0027The need was an ache, an ache such as I\u0027d never known, gnawing at my stomach, filling my poor brain with a red fever...\u0027 Since her rebirth, the mirror in her room was useless to her. No one ever bothered to sketch her picture, so it was easy to forget her own face. John had shown her pictures of Lucy, looking like a little girl dressed up in her mother\u0027s clothes. Whenever she imagined her face, she saw only Lucy. \u0027I beckoned her from the path,\u0027 she said, leaning over from the pile of pillows on the bed, her face close to his. \u0027I sang under my breath, and I waved to her. I wished her to me, and she came...\u0027 She stroked his cheek and laid her head against his chest. The tune came to her, and the words. \u0027It Was Only a Violet I Plucked from My Mother\u0027s Grave\u0027. John held his breath, sweating a little. His every fibre was held tense. Her thirst for him rose as she retold the story. \u0027There were red eyes before me, and a voice calling. I left the path, and she was waiting. It was a cold, cold night but she wore only a white shift. Her skin was white in the moonlight. Her...\u0027 She caught herself. She was speaking as Mary Jane, not Lucy. Mary Jane, she said inside, be careful... John stood up, gently pushing her away, and walked across the room. He took a grip on her washstand and looked in the mirror, trying to find something in his reflection. Mary Jane was confused. All her life, she\u0027d been giving men what they wanted. Now she was dead and things were the same. She went to John and hugged him from behind. He jumped at her touch, surprised. Of course, he hadn\u0027t seen her coming. \u0027John,\u0027 she cooed at him, \u0027come to bed, John. Make me warm.\u0027 He pushed her away again, roughly this time. She was unused to her vampire\u0027s strength. Imagining herself still a feeble girl, she was one. \u0027Lucy,\u0027 he said, emptily, not to her... Anger sparked in her mind. The last of Mary Jane, trying to keep mouth and nose above the surface of the dark sea, exploded. \u0027I\u0027m not your bloody Lucy Westenra,\u0027 she shouted. \u0027I\u0027m Mary Jane Kelly, and I don\u0027t care who knows it.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he said, reaching into his jacket, gripping something hard, \u0027you\u0027re not Lucy...\u0027 Even before the silver knife was out, she realised how foolish she\u0027d been. Not to have seen earlier. Her throat stung lightly. Where it had been cut.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-52.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
