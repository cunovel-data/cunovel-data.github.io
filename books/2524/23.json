{"id":109217,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"HEADLESS CHICKENS It was as if the city were on fire! Beauregard was at the Cafe de Paris when the cry went up. With Kate Reed and several other reporters, he ran to the police station. The street was full of people running and shouting. A masked lout, a dozen assorted crucifixes strung about his neck, drunkenly smashed windows, yelling that the Judgement of God was at hand, that vampires were Demons of the Pit. Sergeant Thick was minding the shop. A come-down for the detective, but a responsible position. Apparently, Lestrade was at the murder site and Abberline off duty. Kate dashed out to find Dutfield\u0027s Yard, but Beauregard decided to stay. \u0027Nothing we can do yet, sir,\u0027 the sergeant said. \u0027I\u0027ve put a dozen men out, but they\u0027re just blundering in the fog.\u0027 \u0027Surely the murderer will be covered in blood?\u0027 Thick shrugged. \u0027Not if he\u0027s careful. Or if he wears a reversible.\u0027 \u0027I beg your pardon?\u0027 Thick opened his grey tweed coat and showed a tartan interior. \u0027Turns inside out. You can wear it both ways.\u0027 \u0027Clever.\u0027 \u0027This is a bloody messy job, Mr Beauregard.\u0027 A couple of uniformed constables dragged in the window-smasher. Thick hauled off the struggling man\u0027s flour-sack hood and recognised one of John Jago\u0027s fearless Knights of Christendom. The sergeant cringed away from the Crusader\u0027s whisky breath. \u0027The unholy leeches shall be...\u0027 Thick balled the hood and shoved it in the vandal\u0027s mouth. \u0027Lock him up and let him sleep it off,\u0027 he ordered the constables. \u0027We\u0027ll talk about charges when the shopkeepers get up tomorrow and see what damage he\u0027s done.\u0027 For the first time Beauregard was at hand when the murderer was about his business, but he might as well be safe in bed in Chelsea for all he could do. \u0027Headless chickens, we are, sir,\u0027 Thick said. \u0027Running around in bloody circles.\u0027 Beauregard hefted his sword-cane, and wished the Ripper would come out and fight. \u0027Cup of tea, sir?\u0027 Thick asked. Before Beauregard could thank the sergeant, a warm constable, out of breath, shoved through the doors. He took off his helmet, gasping. \u0027What is it now, Collins? Some fresh calamity?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s gone and done it again, sarge,\u0027 Collins blurted. \u0027Two for a penny. Two in one night.\u0027 \u0027What!\u0027 \u0027Liz Stride by Berner Street, now a bint called Eddowes in Mitre Square.\u0027 \u0027Mitre Square. That\u0027s off our patch. One for the City boys.\u0027 The boundary between the jurisdictions of the Metropolitan and City Police ran through the parish. The murderer, between crimes, had crossed the border. \u0027It\u0027s almost as though he\u0027s trying to make us look complete bollock-heads. He\u0027ll be ripping them outside Scotland Yard next, with a note for the Commissioner written in scarlet.\u0027 Beauregard shook his head. Another life wasted. This was no longer just a commission from the Diogenes Club. Innocent people were being killed. He felt an urgent need to do something. \u0027I had the news from PC Holland, one of the City blokes. He said this Eddowes...\u0027 \u0027Name of Catharine, I reckon. A familiar face around these parts. Spent more time sleeping it off in our cells than wherever she was lodging.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I reckoned it\u0027d be Cathy,\u0027 said Collins, pausing to look upset. \u0027Any rate, Holland says the bastard finished his job this time. Not like with Liz Stride, just a slash at the throat and a scarper in the dark. He was back to his usual, and gutted her proper.\u0027 Thick swore. \u0027Poor bloody Cathy,\u0027 Collins said. \u0027She was a dreadful old tart, but she never did anyone no harm. Not real harm.\u0027 \u0027Poor bloody us, more like,\u0027 Thick said. \u0027After this, unless we get him sharp-ish, it\u0027s not going to be the easy life being a copper in this parish.\u0027 Beauregard knew Thick was right. Ruthven would have someone important\u0027s resignation, maybe Warren\u0027s; and the Prince Consort would probably have to be restrained from impaling a few lower-ranking policemen, pour encourager les autres. Another messenger appeared. It was Ned, the fleet-foot from the Cafe de Paris. Beauregard had given him a shilling earlier, pressing him into the service of the Diogenes Club. Thick glowered like an ogre and the child skidded to a halt well away from him. He had been so eager to bring Beauregard a message that he had dared venture into a police station. Now, his nervousness was reasserting itself; he trod as gingerly as a mouse in a cattery. \u0027Miss Reed says you\u0027re to come to Toynbee \u0027All, sir. Urgent.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-23.html","bookId":2524,"book":{"id":2524,"title":"Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula (Anno Dracula #1) It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian Prince infamously known as Count Dracula.
