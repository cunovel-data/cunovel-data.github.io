{"id":60059,"no":303,"title":"Chapter 303 Blood Slaughter Hand Cao Zhen","content":"Chapter 303 Blood Slaughter Hand Cao Zhen As Teng Lei’s furious shout landed, numerous orderly responses immediately sounded out from below. Soon after, figure after figure swept forth like lightning, each taking a position and swiftly forming a strange formation. Although the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s so-called formation was still lacking in comparison to the formation where the four great clans joined hands, its power was still pretty formidable. After all, regardless, the Ghastly Puppet Cult was a top tier faction in the Great Desolate Province. Even if this was just a branch division, there were still quite a number of elite practitioners. Hence, the might of the formation that they assembled was powerful without equal. “Ghastly Puppet Devil Assembly Formation!” Numerous shouts sounded out from the Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners’ mouths before pillar after pillar of Yuan Power light pillars instantly burst out from their bodies, linking up to each other and converging into an enormous light formation, which enveloped the sky above Lin Dong. At the center of the formation were Teng Lei and some Ghastly Puppet Cult elder ranked practitioners. Their cultivation stage had all reached the Qi Creation stage and they were rather strong. Currently, they were urging either Yuan Power or Mental Energy from their bodies to fuse into the great formation, causing the formation undulations to become increasingly frightening. Evidently, reputation of this Ghastly Puppet Cult formation was not weak. Hence, it immediately drew cries of alarm from the Great Puppet City. Obviously, they had all heard of this famed formation. At the Great Devil Sect branch division area, Mu Qianqian’s and a group of Great Devil Sect practitioners’ eyes were all tightly fixed on the battle in the sky. “They actually used the Ghastly Puppet Devil Assembly Formation. Given the number of Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners here, with the power of the formation, one’s might would practically be able to contend against a half-step-to Manifestation practitioner. Lin Dong is truly unfortunate.” A Great Devil Sect practitioner remarked. “That might not be the case. Lin Dong’s strength is extremely overwhelming. After all, Hua Gu is a true blue advanced Qi Creation stage practitioner, yet, he was heavily injured in less than two rounds. With this level of battle power, who among the Qi Creation stage can hope to match up against him? Even if Teng Lei plans on relying on the great formation to deal with Lin Dong, it will not be so easy.” Another Great Devil Sect elder stroked his beard while he shook his head and said. “...” As she heard the various voices from the group behind her, Mu Qianqian’s beautiful eyes gently glimmered while her eyes remain fixated on the young figure which had been enveloped by the great formation. She was naturally able to feel that compared to the time at the Symbol Puppet Lair, Lin Dong had become much stronger. At the very least, the her at that time was confident that she would be able to exchange blows with Lin Dong, yet, that confidence had now been significantly weakened. For a powerful practitioner like Hua Gu, even she did not dare to say that she would be able to beat him. Yet, in Lin Dong’s hands, the former was unable to withstand even a single blow. Moreover, Mu Qianqian knew that there was still a high class Symbol Puppet in Lin Dong’s hands. Furthermore, the Manifestation martial art that he had obtained from the Manifestation Martial Tablet had yet to be used. Hence, if Teng Lei wanted to borrow the power of the great formation to kill Lin Dong, it would truly be quite difficult... While many Great Devil Sect practitioners were discussing about the battle in the sky, in another section, where the Martial Alliance was located, a huge number of Martial Alliance practitioners also gushed out and cast astonished gazes towards the sky. “Wu Ci, is that youngster Lin Dong, who you mentioned to have obtained a Manifestation martial art from the Manifestation Martial Tablet? Looks like he is indeed extremely ferocious!” Standing at the head of the group, a white haired elder wore a strange look on his face as he stared at Lin Dong in the sky before turning to a young man beside him and asking. “Heh heh, in the ancient tablet space, Lin Dong had taken on the Wang Clan practitioners by himself, before he was able to occupy the ninth seat. If this Teng Lei plans on borrowing the great formation to kill the former, he is perhaps being a little too optimistic.” The young man named Wu Ci had met with Lin Dong a few times. At this moment, he smiled as he replied. “This time around, the Ghastly Puppet Cult is probably going to suffer a crushing defeat at Lin Dong’s hands, haha…” As he finished his sentence, Wu Ci’s tone was clearly tinted with joy at their misfortune. The three top factions all had conflicts due to their conflicts of interest. Now that they were able to see the Ghastly Puppet Cult suffer, they were naturally rather delighted. “Difficult.” However, in response to his words, the white haired elder slowly shook his head. He gazed at the direction the Ghastly Puppet Cult was in and reminded in an indifferent tone: “Did you forget the fellow that is stationed at the Ghastly Puppet Cult branch division?” Upon hearing this, Lin Dong was first stunned, but soon after, his complexion suddenly changed as he cried out: “Blood Slaughter Hand Cao Zhen? Hasn’t that fellow not appeared for a year?” “He has not appeared only because he plans on attacking the Manifestation stage.” The white haired elder sighed as he explained. “Attacking the Manifestation stage? How can it be so easy!” Wu Ci’s pupils slightly shrunk as he said. “Given that fellow’s capability, even if he does not truly advance to the Manifestation stage, the half-step-to Manifestation will not escape him. I believe that his strength should be enough to turn the tables.” The white haired elder replied. “Right now, that fellow has yet to show up only because he does not want to halt his cultivation because of this kind of matter. If Lin Dong continues to stir trouble, perhaps he will find it very difficult to leave Great Puppet City safely.” Wu Ci was silent for a while. Half-step-to Manifestation. Although it was still not considered as the true Manifestation stage, it was far from what the advanced Qi Creation stage could compare to. If that fellow was truly still in Great Puppet City’s Ghastly Puppet Cult, Lin Dong would be in danger today. Though the battle power he had displayed was rather powerful, there was still a large gap when faced with a half-step-to Manifestation practitioner. “However, Lin Dong is also not easy to deal with…” Wu Ci lifted his head and gazed at the young figure. From what he could see, Lin Dong was not an impulsive person. He should know that the strong practitioners of the Ghastly Puppet Cult here was as numerous as the clouds. If he was not certain, he would definitely not engage in this kind of meaningless action like throwing away one’s life. Thus, it was still worth discussing what the outcome would be. ... In the sky, vigorous Yuan Power formed into a light formation that enveloped a hundred meter radius. Wave after wave of Yuan Power were akin to ripples as they spread outwards... “Devil Assembly Formation, murder this imbecile!” Teng Lei and three other people who had reached the Qi Creation stage presided over the great formation. The four of them suddenly sternly shouted out as the Yuan Power in the sky instantly rumbled, under the gazes of the entire city, it swiftly formed into a humongous Yuan Power figure of light which was a hundred meters large. This light figure was incomparably enormous. Like a huge devil, it had two horns on its head, while an almost ruthless Yuan Power frantically gushed out from its body, directly causing the air around it to explode. “Kill!” In that instant, every practitioner of the Ghastly Puppet Cult furiously shouted. Killing intent rocketed up into the sky, gathering at the huge devil’s palm and actually condensing into a blood colored trident. The air around it was extremely cold and bizarre. “Bang!” When the blood colored trident took shape, the huge devil light figure brought with it a sky filled with killing intent as he stepped forward in the air, while the blood colored trident viciously stabbing towards Lin Dong! “Roar!” Behind Lin Dong, Little Flame released an earth-shattering roar as its body instantly expanded several tens of meters, making it look like a small solemn mountain. From its huge maw, a blood colored like shot out like a dragon, giving off vigorous energy undulations as it viciously shot towards the huge devil light figure. “Bang!” In response to Little Flame’s attack, the blood colored trident in the huge devil’s hands suddenly danced and powerfully chopped downwards, directly clashing against the blood light with a loud bang. Immediately, a berserk energy swiftly spread out from the epicenter. Berserk energy filled the skies and the huge devil light figure directly ripped it apart, while the blood colored trident once again brought with it an extremely terrible killing intent as it enveloped Lin Dong! However, Lin Dong’s expression remained calm in the face of the torrential huge devil light figure, His hand grasped around the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd as his body swiftly expanded. Faintly, an equally ferocious aura was emitted from his body. As he grew increasingly stronger, Lin Dong was gradually able to utilise the Ancient Dragon Ape’s essence blood to the limit. When the dragon ape’s essence blood was urged to the limit, a hundred meter dragon ape illusionary figure actually appeared at Lin Dong’s back as a ferocious aura that originated from ancient times unfurled in the sky, causing shock to fill onlookers’ faces! The current Lin Dong was just like a human-shaped Ancient Dragon Ape! “What kind of crappy great formation is this, watch me break it with a single strike of my halberd!” Lin Dong’s figure was like a giant standing in the sky. Resplendent Yuan Power abruptly burst out of his body like a flood while the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd in his hand also swelled till it was about ten meters large, the golden light flickering on it filled with astonishing Yuan Power undulations. Lin Dong roared as he took a single step forward. Resplendent and vigorous Yuan Power exploded outwards, golden light gushing in the sky as the huge Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd in his hand suddenly burst forth! As the ancient halberd thrust forth, an enormous golden dragon and dragon ape appeared on its body. Two humongous illusory figures containing unequaled power and tyranny whizzed across the horizon and viciously slammed into the huge devil light figure in a shocking manner! “Boom!” An earth-shattering explosion echoed across the skies. The entire Great Puppet City seemed to tremble as wave after wave of extremely berserk Yuan Power frantically unfurled... “Bang bang!” The collision in the sky did not last for long before the crowd watched in astonishment as the roaring golden dragon and dragon ape illusionary figure directly blew apart the huge devil light figure! “Pch!” The instant the huge devil light figure exploded, the complexions of the many Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners below turned pale as they wildly vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. Teng Lei and the rest also staggered and almost fell to the ground. Staring at the great formation that had burst apart in the sky, gasps rang out in Great Puppet City. No one expected that Lin Dong would actually be able to forcibly break apart the great formation formed by numerous Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners alone! “The Ghastly Puppet Cult is merely so!” Under countless astonished gazes, the huge figure in the sky lowered its head and roared. Its roar was like thunder as it resounded across the entire Great Puppet City. “I know that there are still strong practitioners in your Ghastly Puppet Cult. If you cannot accept this, come forth!” Golden light curled around Lin Dong’s body, his stern and tyrannical gaze suddenly shot towards the Ghastly Puppet Cult branch division location as an icy roar once again sounded out. When he entered Great Puppet City, Little Marten had sensed that there was an extremely powerful aura at the Ghastly Puppet Cult area. That aura was practically comparable to Lin Langtian! “Haha, I merely secluded myself for several years. Has the Great Desolate Province forgotten my Blood Slaughter Hand Cao Zhen’s name? Even a nameless younger generation dares to misbehave at my Ghastly Puppet Cult?!” Just as Lin Dong’s shout landed, a world-shaking laughter suddenly rang out in the skies. At the same time, an incomparably ferocious blood colored figure of light abruptly flew out from the Ghastly Puppet Cult branch division area as a cold murderous aura stealthily spread out like a knife that cut to the bone, causing the expressions of everyone in the city to change!
