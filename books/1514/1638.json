As this aura erupted, even the surrounding Earth Terminus Cold Qi were completely scattered.\\n\\n “You’ve succeeded?”\\n\\n Floating above the Eight Eye Earth Devil Spider, Little Marten was also disturbed by this aura as delight gushed up in its eyes and it asked.\\n\\n The black hole behind Lin Dong slowly dissipated while his body gently floated to the ground. An extremely intense light flickered in his eyes, and the Yuan Power undulations emitted by his body was several times stronger than before.\\n\\n “Advanced to the Manifestation stage already?” Little Marten flew to Lin Dong’s front and urgently inquired.\\n\\n “Bare I guess.” Lin Dong closed his eyes and felt the condition of his body. Soon after, he chuckled and said: “Should be half-step-to Manifestation. Still a step away from the initial Manifestation stage.”\\n\\n “Half-step-to Manifestation eh… that’s really not bad.” Little Marten was taken aback. Soon after, it sincerely remarked. After all, Lin Dong’s strength had really risen too quickly over this period of time, although he had the aid of the ‘Devouring Ancestral Symbol’, it was sometimes not good to go too far. Being able to overcome the Qi Creation stage and step into the half-step-to Manifestation stage was already rather satisfactory.\\n\\n Lin Dong nodded his head, normally, advancing to the Manifestation stage was no simple feat. This time, being able to borrow the Earth Terminus Cold Qi source to progress a step was already rather satisfying to Lin Dong.\\n\\n “What are you plans now?” Little Marten looked towards Lin Dong and spoke. Now that he possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, Lin Dong also possessed the ability to leave the Mysterious Black Yin crevice at any time.\\n\\n “Let’s first leave to Mysterious Black Yin crevices to find look for Little Flame, after which… we find Teng Sha to settle our debts!” A cold expression surfaced in Lin Dong’s eyes. Previously, he had been forced to escape into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice by Teng Sha, causing him to almost lose his life and even be separated with Little Flame. Now, he did not know whether the latter was dead or alive. If this debt was not clearly settled, he would no longer be called Lin Dong!\\n\\n “Okay.”\\n\\n Little Marten did not have any objections towards this. Lin Dong’s current strength was enough to contend against Teng Sha and now did have the capability to take revenge.\\n\\n Since they had made a decision, Lin Dong did not intend to tarry any further. With a thought, a black hole spread out behind him, protecting his body. When Little Marten saw this, it hastily leapt onto Lin Dong’s shoulder. It needed to rely on Lin Dong’s devouring power to leave the Mysterious Black Yin crevice.\\n\\n “Go!”\\n\\n The tip of Lin Dong’s foot pushed off the ground as his body rose into the air. The black hole squirmed as it thoroughly devoured the Earth Terminus Cold Qi that whizzed over, transforming into a black flash and directly zooming to the upper area of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice like a hot knife cutting through butter.\\n\\n The Mysterious Black Yin crevice that many practitioners saw as a land of death now did not have any resistance for Lin Dong. Compared the when he had risked death to charge in half a year ago, it was clearly two extremes...\\n\\n Of course, the current Lin Dong was naturally also several tens of times stranger than half a year ago. Not only had he successfully advanced to the half-step-to Manifestation, his Mental Energy had also stepped into the high level Soul Symbol Master level. In the entire Great Desolate Province, one could not find any one who was capable of competing in Mental Energy...\\n\\n An earth shaking change had happened to him in a short half a year. If Teng Sha knew of this, would he be so angry that he would wildly vomit blood? However, given Lin Dong’s character, that day would come very quickly…\\n\\n ......\\n\\n The edge of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice.\\n\\n Ever since the exciting treasure snatching event half a year ago, the surroundings of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice had stayed extremely lively even after half a year.\\n\\n That night, everyone had seen Lin Dong charge into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice with the treasure. Although many people believed that the current Lin Dong had already become a corpse within the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, they understood that Lin Dong could die, but the treasure was definitely safely existing. After all, the treasure had a seal that even the combined might of the Ghastly Puppet Cult could not break.\\n\\n Hence, over this past half a year, countless people lingered in this place, hoping that one day the heavens would show favor to them and gift them the mysterious treasure that had once caused the Ghastly Puppet Cult to go crazy.\\n\\n However, the mysterious treasure was not found in the end, but instead, several unfortunate fellows had been sucked into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice and twisted to pieces, such that even a skeleton no longer remained.\\n\\n Yet, though this place was dangerous, the lure of the mysterious treasure was too strong. Hence, even after half a year, one could still see several treasure seekers at the edges of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice.\\n\\n Countless Earth Terminus Cold Qi whizzed about the inside of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice with woo woo sounds. Every time that incomparably deadly cold qi spread outwards, it would cause the expressions of the people in the area to rapidly change as they very cautiously took shelter, afraid that they would be drawn in.\\n\\n However, the Earth Terminus Cold Qi within the Mysterious Black Yin crevice today seemed to be exceptionally ferocious, and many people had to carefully distance themselves from areas close to the Mysterious Black Yin crevice.\\n\\n “Swish!”\\n\\n While several people took shelter from the berserk Earth Terminus Cold Qi, an intense wind sound suddenly echoed out. Next, a figure of light flew out from the Earth Terminus Cold Qi at an astonishing speed.\\n\\n The light figure’s speed was extremely quick, and with the Earth Terminus Cold Qi shrouding it, no one was able to sense that the figure had already unknowingly appeared at the edge of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice like a ghost.\\n\\n “After searching for two days, there are still no signs of Little Flame.”\\n\\n The figure stood at the edge of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, his expression incomparably grim as he stared at the screaming Earth Terminus Cold Qi within the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, while his eyes took on an exceptionally icy look.\\n\\n This figure was naturally Lin Dong. Over these two days, he had constantly searched in the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, yet, he did not find any traces of Little Flame. Even Little Flame’s skeleton could not be found.\\n\\n “That fellow should still be alive. Demonic Beasts adapt to this kind of cold qi extremely rapidly. Furthermore, it had devoured the blood bat dragon’s blood power. It should be fine.” As if it knew of Lin Dong’s currently gloomy feeling, Little Marten consoled in his mind.\\n\\n Lin Dong silently nodded his head, but soon after, a scarlet red surfaced in his eyes: “If anything happens to Little Flame, Teng Sha, I will massacre your Ghastly Puppet Cult!”\\n\\n “*Sigh*, let us first follow the edge of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice and search over this period of time. I am more familiar with its aura, so as long as it appears in my scope of sensing, I will be able to locate its position.” Little Marten suggested.\\n\\n “Okay.”\\n\\n Lin Dong deeply inhaled, his fists slowly clenching as he turned around and apathetically glanced at a group of figures nearby before slowly walking in another direction.\\n\\n “Eh, that fellow looks a little familiar…” Nearby, several figures gathered together. From their attire, they should be the disciples of a sect in the vicinity of the Mysterious Black Yin mountain range and from the looks of it, they came here to search for treasure. At this moment, a middle aged man among them was gazing at Lin Dong’s back, a thoughtful look on his face as he said.\\n\\n “*Sigh*, senior you feel everyone is familiar looking. I’ve said before that this Mysterious Black Yin crevice has been searched god knows how many times by others, how can it possibly be our turn to search for treasure? We might as well return, or else if we are drawn into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, even our corpses would be unable to be found.” Beside the middle aged man, a slightly younger man wiped the dirt on his face as he grumbled.\\n\\n “What do you know? I clearly remembered that Lin Dong charged into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice from this position. If we are lucky, we might find that mysterious treasure. Even the Ghastly Puppet Cult values that object so much, if we can obtain it, our Earth Terminus Sect will definitely be able to surpass the Ghastly Puppet Cult!” A lean middle aged man to the front of the young man chided.\\n\\n Upon hearing this, a few young disciples could only helplessly shake their heads. Soon after, one of them spoke: “Lin Dong is truly courageous, actually daring to go to the Ghastly Puppet Cult and snatch the treasure. In the end, he was forced into this land of death and now even his corpse cannot be found.”\\n\\n “Right, that Ghastly Puppet Cult leader Teng Sha is an advanced Manifestation stage practitioner after all. I’m afraid that you can’t even find anyone in the Great Desolate Province who would be his match, isn’t Lin Dong snatching the thing practically courting death?”\\n\\n “How can it only be courting death, never mind that he died, I heard that a huge number of Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners were dispatched a few days before and they have captured the Demonic Beast that was at his side. Today, they are even going to torture it in front of everyone and refine it into a beast puppet. Tch tch, that Teng Sha is truly vicious indeed, even going so far as to vent his anger on a Demonic Beast!” The middle aged man shook his head, however, just as his words sounded out, he suddenly found that the land seemed to have abruptly turned cold. Before he could respond, the air before him exploded as a ghost like figure directly appeared in front of him and a hand swiftly grabbed his throat.\\n\\n “Senior?!”\\n\\n This sudden change caused the few of them to be stunned. Soon after, they quickly regained their senses as they sternly shouted towards the figure grabbing the middle aged man’s throat.\\n\\n “*Cough*, you… you are… Lin Dong?!”\\n\\n However, just as their shouts landed, the middle aged man, who had been grabbed by the figure, stared at the figure before him with incomparable dread filling his expression, while his voice sounded out with much difficulty.\\n\\n “You just said that the Ghastly Puppet Cult caught a Demonic Beast?” Lin Dong had scarlet red eyes as he stared at the middle aged man before him, his voice sounding as if it had come from the nine hells below.\\n\\n “Don’t kill me, I have never offended you, I can tell you what you want to know!”\\n\\n “The Demonic Beast that was captured by the Ghastly Puppet Cult is indeed the one that had followed you into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice half a year ago. Today, Teng Sha has spread news that he wants to refine that Demonic Beast into a beast puppet in front of everyone as a warning to those who have offended the Ghastly Puppet Cult!” Staring at Lin Dong’s gaze that was practically about to devour a person, the middle aged man understood the severity of this matter and immediately spit out everything he knew about the situation.\\n\\n “Boom!”\\n\\n When the middle aged man’s voice landed, an extremely terrifying aura abruptly unfurled from Lin Dong’s body, causing the few people nearby to be directly jolted backwards as they vomited blood.\\n\\n “Teng Sha, if I don’t turn your Ghastly Puppet Cult into rivers of blood today, I, Lin Dong swear that I am not a person!”\\n\\n Lin Dong’s expression was malevolent as a maniacal killing intent gushed out from his heart. He flung away the person in his hand as his figure moved, and a golden light soared into the skies, bringing with it a sky full of cold murderous intent as it shot towards the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s location.\\n\\n Today, he will massacre the Ghastly Puppet Cult!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-327","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
