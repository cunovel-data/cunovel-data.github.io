{"id":62261,"no":2505,"title":"Chapter 1192: Entering The Tablet","content":"The deepest part of the Desolate Hall. Two rays of light flashed across the sky, before they showed themselves. They were Lin Dong and Ying Huanhuan. When Lin Dong saw this familiar mountain range, many flashbacks from three years ago surfaced in his mind. Soon after, he smiled at Ying Huanhuan and asked, “Do you still remember the bet we made back then?” Ying Huanhuan used her hand to straighten a loose hair near her ear. Promptly, she pursed her red lips before she replied with a smile, “Why are you such a calculative person? Moreover, it’s your fault for having such poor judgement. You could have entered the Sky Hall, yet you chose the Desolate Hall instead. You truly don’t know how to appreciate kindness.” Lin Dong smiled. Now that he thought about it, he really missed what happened back then. Soon after the Lin Dong duo appeared, many light figures rushed over from the distance. Following which, Ying Xuanzi, Little Marten and the rest hurried over. “What are you guys planning to do?” Ying Xuanzi looked at the two of them before glancing at the ground. From his expression, it was clear that he knew what was going on with the Great Desolate Tablet. “I am the one who told father.” Beside him, Ying Huanhuan said in a soft voice. “It is not easy to deal with the Yimo that is being suppressed by the Great Desolate Tablet. Moreover, Dao Sect will definitely be the first to suffer if it escapes.” Lin Dong nodded. This matter was extremely important to Dao Sect. As the sect master, it was only right for Ying Xuanzi to be informed. “Sect master, all of you should set up a formation outside. Kill anything that manages to escape from within!” Lin Dong said in a deep voice. According to what Yan said, the creature being suppressed by the Great Desolate Tablet was a true king who had passed two Reincarnation Tribulations. Therefore, if that being managed to escape, it would definitely cause them a great deal of problems. “Little Marten, first elder Zhu Li, please assist them. Nothing must go awry.” Lin Dong looked at Little Marten’s group and said with a grave expression. “Additionally, martial uncle Wu Dao, please temporarily evacuate the disciples of the Desolate Hall and move them to the other halls.” Ying Huanhuan looked at Wu Dao, who had hurried over, before she said. “Understood.” After seeing this lineup, Wu Dao immediately understood the severity of this matter. He quickly acknowledged Ying Huanhuan’s orders before withdrawing. After which, he began to evacuate the disciples of the Desolate Hall. Lin Dong nodded upon seeing this. Then, with a grave expression, he looked at the land below. After which, he stomped his foot before a majestic force directly penetrated the empty space and entered the land. Rumble! The entire mountain range shook violently after that force charged into the ground. After which, a huge crack slowly spread across the land. Finally, a huge and ancient stone tablet slowly rose from within the crack. Buzz. Dark chilly winds suddenly blew across the sky after that ancient stone tablet appeared. Meanwhile, there seemed to be screeches being vaguely emitted. This unusual phenomenon caused Lin Dong’s heart to sink. It seems like the Great Desolate Tablet was quite badly eroded by the demonic aura over the last three years. The ancient stone tablet finally broke free from the ground and completely revealed itself in front of everyone’s eyes. When Lin Dong looked at it, he involuntarily clenched his fists. Currently, that huge tablet was covered with countless black demonic lines. These demonic lines were scattered across the tablet and they resembled the meridians of a person. Meanwhile, a death like aura was being slowly emitted from the stone tablet. Other than those demonic lines, which pulsed like a heart, the stone tablet was also covered by a thick layer of ice. Currently, blue light was glimmering on that layer of ice, suppressing some of the demonic aura. “As of now, I am only able to suppress some of the demonic aura and slow down the erosion.” Ying Huanhuan softly said. This layer of ice was clearly her handiwork. However, it was obvious that the true king within the Great Desolate Tablet was extremely powerful. Hence, she was unable to destroy it with her current strength. “This is more than enough.” Lin Dong said solemnly. If it was not because Ying Huanhuan had intervened and helped to suppress the demonic aura, it was likely that the Great Desolate Tablet would not be able to hang on until his return. “What should we do now?” Ying Huanhuan asked. “I will enter the Great Desolate Tablet and finish off that true king.” Lin Dong said. Only by killing that true king, would the demonic aura disappear. Following which, the Great Desolate Tablet would be able to recover. “I will go with you.” Ying Huanhuan said without any hesitation. The Yimo king within the Great Desolate Tablet was extremely powerful. Therefore, she was worried and did not want Lin Dong to go by himself. Lin Dong hesitated for a moment upon hearing this. “Humph, I am not weaker than you and I will not be a burden.” After she saw his hesitation, Ying Huanhuan immediately snorted softly and said. Lin Dong smiled bitterly. He pondered for a moment before he nodded. As of now, Ying Huanhuan was indeed completely different compared to before. In fact, in an actual fight, he might not be able to defeat her. Furthermore, this was going to be an extremely dangerous task. Hence, he knew that he would have a better chance of success with her by his side. “Alright. This time around, we will join forces to eliminate that devil.” Ying Huanhuan nodded with satisfaction after she saw Lin Dong nodding his head. “Everyone, I will leave everything on the outside to you guys.” Lin Dong once again reminded Little Marten’s group. After which, he extended his hand towards Ying Huanhuan. The latter’s face reddened slightly upon seeing this. After which, she placed her delicate hand into his. An icy chill spread after her little hand landed into Lin Dong’s palm. It felt like ice, which had been frozen for tens of thousands of years, and that chill drilled deep into his bones. “Ugh.” Lin Dong sighed softly in his heart, before pity flashed across his eyes. After which, he gradually tightened his grip over Ying Huanhuan’s small hand. It was as though he wanted to warm that small icy cold hand. “Let’s get going.” Ying Huanhuan became a little absent-minded after she detected Lin Dong’s action. Promptly, she tilted her head. Her eyes were a little red as she softly urged him. Lin Dong smiled. His body moved before the both of them transformed into a ray of light and rushed into the Great Desolate Tablet. Ripples appeared on the surface of the Great Desolate Tablet just as they came into contact with it. After which, the both of them vanished. 　　…… Darkness came surging over like floodwaters after they entered the Great Desolate Tablet. Lin Dong quickly but gently grabbed that icy cold palm. Buzz. An icy blue light suddenly erupted and expelled the darkness. Lin Dong turned his head and saw that Ying Huanhuan had lifted her other hand. Meanwhile, there was an ice lamp being formed on her fingertips. Gentle yet icy cold light, was being emitted from that ice lamp. Ying Huanhuan looked at the darkness. Then, a cold glint flashed across her pretty eyes before she spoke in a faint voice, “Aren’t you looking down on us by using such petty tricks?” A huge ice lotus surfaced under their feet after her voice sounded. Soon after, that ice lotus rotated, before countless flower petals shot into the darkness. Many sharp screeches followed. Those flower petals shattered, transforming into glowing spots that scattered. Lin Dong surveyed his surroundings, before he saw countless huge black snakes crouching within the darkness. Meanwhile, those snake eyes, which were filled with evil demonic aura, were staring intently at the both of them. Lin Dong slowly took a step forward, while lightning crackled within his eyes. Soon after, a thunder suddenly resounded from within his body. Then, thunder clouds began to converge within this dark space. In the next moment, countless thunderbolts crazily rained down. Instantly, this dark space became extremely dazzling and violent. “Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol?” When Ying Huanhuan saw the mysterious ripples being emitted from within Lin Dong’s body, surprise involuntarily flashed across her pretty eyes as she softly cried out. “Aye, I obtained it when I was at the Chaotic Demon Sea.” Lin Dong smiled. After which, he looked at the deepest part of the darkness and said, “It seems like the Great Desolate Tablet has already been overran. In fact, the space within the tablet is now under the control of the true king.” “We can just break it.” Ying Huanhuan clenched her hand. Immediately, endless chilling aura gathered before they transformed into a cold ice like zither. Then, her hands landed on it before she plucked the strings on her zither. The zither music sounded. Immediately, a monstrous blue icy ripple suddenly swept out from the zither. That ice ripple swept across the place, transforming into a huge ice phoenix in the process. Following which, a clear phoenix cry resounded through the darkness. Swoosh! The ice phoenix rushed forward. It was accompanied by a monstrous cold aura as it charged into the darkness, which was permeated by endless demonic aura. Finally, it exploded with a loud ‘bang’. “Infinite Ice Seal.” An icy cold voice was emitted from Ying Huanhuan’s mouth. Soon after, Lin Dong’s pupils hardened when he saw that the overbearing Yimo Qi had actually froze. Following which, they turned into many black ice crumbs before they vanished with a ‘bang’. The darkness was disappearing at a frightening speed. The Lin Dong duo quickened their pace and chased after that darkness. This continued for awhile before their footsteps began to slow. Then, their expressions gradually turned cold as they looked at the scene in front of them. Far in front of them was black barren land. Meanwhile, in the middle of that barren land, stood a black stone tablet. That stone tablet was the tablet spirit of the Great Desolate Tablet, which Lin Dong had met before. However, Lin Dong’s eyes merely paused on the stone tablet for a moment. After which, he slowly shifted his attention upwards. This was because he saw a black figure seated on top of the stone tablet. “Tsk tsk, what a familiar scent...” Seated on the stone tablet, a devil slowly lifted his head. His crimson eyes were filled with utmost evil and it looked as though there were endless brutality surging within them. His sharp hands grabbed that stone tablet, before he scratched it with his nails. Immediately, a couple of deep scars were left on the surface of the tablet. That devil stared at Lin Dong, before his eyes shrunk slightly. “Devouring Ancestral Symbol? Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol? Tsk tsk, you are indeed capable. To think that you managed to subdue two Ancestral Symbols…” “A true king who has only passed two Reincarnation Tribulations. Aren’t you a little too arrogant?” Ying Huanhuan chuckled. That devil turned towards Ying Huanhuan. In that instance, Lin Dong could sense that the demonic aura around the former’s body had trembled violently. In fact, there seemed to be hatred and a deeply buried fear within its eyes. “It’s indeed you! Ice Master!” That devil’s sharp voice sounded, “It seems like you have successfully reincarnated. However, from the looks of it, you have not regained your full strength. How dare you act so arrogantly in front of me?” “Tsk tsk!” That devil roared towards the sky and said, “It’s just as well. I shall kill you before you regain your full strength. After that, no one will be able to stop my tribe!” A gentle smile surfaced on Lin Dong’s face. However, his smile was filled with icy cold intent. In the next moment, black light and lightning glow surged simultaneously in his eyes. Following which, vast and mighty ripples swept forth in all directions. “Have you lost your mind after being sealed for so long. There is no telling who will be the one killed today!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1192","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
