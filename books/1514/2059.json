Indistinctly, there seemed to be a frosty twinkle and chill that quietly permeated the air.\\n\\n The chill was not thick, however, it was an icy cold sensation that could pierce into the depths of one’s bones. Her appearance seemed capable of causing one’s soul to thoroughly freeze up.\\n\\n “What..is going on?”asked Lin Dong with a shock expression. It was obvious that he did not understand the mysterious changes that occured to Ying Huanhuan during her training.\\n\\n “This girl is not so simple…” replied Little Marten with a grave expression as he slowly turned around.\\n\\n Lin Dong gently nodded his head. The situation before him was indeed something that would not occur to any random ordinary person.\\n\\n As Lin Dong and the other two observed, a somewhat pained expression appeared on Ying Huanhuan’s beautiful face. In the next moment, ring after ring of icy blue halos unexpectedly started to slowly rise from her body.\\n\\n Crack Snap!\\n\\n The icy blue halo started to dissipate, causing the ground to seemingly turn frost locked instantaneously. After a few breaths, the entire mountain peak had transformed into a blue iceberg.\\n\\n As those few icy blue halos started to spread out, Lin Dong and the other two suddenly saw Ying Huanhuan’s icy blue hair grow longer. As a chillingly frosty gale blew past, her icy blue long hair flew in the air. Coupled with the snowflakes dancing in the air, she looked just like an ice queen amidst the snow\\n\\n The scene before them was majestic and alluring.\\n\\n As the halos started to fluctuate, the pained expression on Ying HuanHuan’s face turned richer. In the next moment, her tightly shut eyes suddenly sprung open.\\n\\n The instant she opened her eyes, her originally black pupils were now permeated with an icy blue colour. Even her pupils had turned icy clear, and there was not a single trace of emotion within them.\\n\\n Her gaze was akin to that of a god looking down on mortals, no joy, no sadness, no benevolence and no evil.\\n\\n A serious expression appeared on Lin Dong’s face when he saw the state that Ying Huanhuan was in. Her current gaze had no focal point, and was not focused on his body. However, he could still feel a chill enveloping his entire body. Ying Huanhuan’s current condition made him feel uneasy and he was unable to accept that this young lady, that was typically brimming with youth and vitality, would display such an icy cold expression...\\n\\n Although he was feeling uneasy in his heart, Lin Dong did not dare to act recklessly. After all, he did not know what exactly had happened within her body. Therefore, he was afraid that if he acted recklessly, he may end up hurting her instead…\\n\\n At this juncture, all they could do was to standby quietly and observe.\\n\\n After Ying Huanhuan opened her eyes, a icy blue luster suddenly appeared on her forehead before the glow spread outwards. After which, the glow started to form into a icy blue ancient runic symbol.\\n\\n “Reincarnation Symbol?”\\n\\n Upon seeing the icy blue ancient runic symbol, Little Marten’s body instantly shivered. Promptly, an astonished expression instantly appeared on his face as he involuntarily exclaimed.\\n\\n “Reincarnation Symbol?” Lin Dong was startled for a moment before he asked. Promptly, he frowned his brows and asked: “ What is that?”\\n\\n “I never thought that it could actually be the Reincarnation Symbol...this lass is indeed not simple. She is actually a Reincarnator…”\\n\\n Little Marten mumbled for a short moment before aspirating. Looking towards Lin Dong, he replied in a deep voice, “ Do you know about the Reincarnation Stage?”\\n\\n Upon hearing that term, Lin Dong’s gaze instantly hardened before he faintly nodded his head and said, “After Life and Death, it would be Reincarnation. As for Reincarnation... immortal…”\\n\\n “In this world, there isn’t anyone who is truly immortal. Even if one steps in Reincarnation stage, they still face dangers that may be beyond the imagination of an ordinary individual. For the Nirvana Stage, there exists the Nirvana Tribulation. As for the Reincarnation Stage, there is also the Reincarnation Tribulation. If one crosses it, one would evolve and would be free and unfettered from the world. However, if one failed, one would disappear by reincarnation.” said Little Marten casually.\\n\\n “Reincarnation Tribulation…”mutter Lin Dong as he pursed his lips. This was obviously the first time he had heard about this. However, that stage was still too far and out of his reach.\\n\\n “What does this have to do with her? Also, what is a Reincarnator?”\\n\\n “People who are able to step into the Reincarnation Stage are probably the existences that are standing on the apex of this world, since they have control over life and death. From another perspective, even time cannot erase them. Qing Zhi, whom we met in the Green Dragon palace, is most likely an expert that has stepped into Reincarnation Stage. If not, he could not have survived until now…”\\n\\n “In the ancient times, if those elites at Reincarnation Stage were to fail their Reincarnation Tribulation, a few of them were able to preserve a little of their consciousness with their remarkable strength. They will let their remnant consciousness enter the reincarnation cycle and wait for a chance to reactivate their consciousness and cross the nirvana back into this world again.”\\n\\n “Thereafter, those individuals who were reborn are called Reincarnators. It seems like this lass should be one of them…” said Little Marten as he stared at the young lady floating in mid air with a weird gaze.\\n\\n “You mean to say that… in her past life...she is an elite at the Reincarnation Stage?” asked Lin Dong as he massaged his temples. The so-called Reincarnation and this sort of mysterious stuff was undoubtedly too unreal and farfetched to him.\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n Little Marten nodded his head and replied: “ Perhaps, she does not even know about it. This time around, she must have stirred the remnant consciousness in the depths of her soul when she was agglomerating her Yuan Spirit. Therefore, this incident occurred.”\\n\\n “Of course, this does not mean that all of the Reincarnators would be able to awaken. A large majority of Reincarnators would simply lead an ordinary life. As they continue along the cycle over and over again, the sliver of consciousness would gradually be worn down till it thoroughly dissipated. At that time, the super elite at Reincarnation Stage would have completely vanished from this world...:”\\n\\n “So...would this affect her personality? In other words, would she...no longer be Ying Huanhuan and become the super expert that once ruled the heavens and the earth?” asked Lin Dong after hesitating for a while.\\n\\n “If she awakened, there would be a few changes. However, in the end the one that would remain in control would be the person in this reincarnation cycle.”replied Little Marten with a smile after he sensed Lin Dong’s worry.\\n\\n Lin Dong gave a bitter laugh and could only nod his head while secretly sighing in his heart. From his point of view, he would rather Ying Huanhuan remain as the pure and innocent young lady that he had known, and not become some super elite that had reincarnated from the ancient times...\\n\\n “Don’t worry. Perhaps she might be a Reincarnator, however, who knows if she can awaken her other side? As long as she doesn’t awaken, she would definitely still be the Ying Huanhuan that you know.” said Little Marten.\\n\\n “Okay.”\\n\\n Lin Dong nodded his head once again before suddenly looking at Little Marten and asking, “ Did you reach the Reincarnation Stage in the past?”\\n\\n Upon hearing that question, Little Marten’s handsome face twitched before he gave a dry laugh and replied, “ I missed it by just a bit. If I had already reached the Reincarnation Stage, I wouldn’t need to hide in the Stone Talisman. And you wouldn’t have met me.”\\n\\n Upon hearing that, Lin Dong gave a smile. He had no intention of mocking him. Their meeting back then had undoubtedly changed their course of lifes. If there was no Lin Dong, Little Marten might have already scattered and died. If not for Little Marten, it would be also be difficult for Lin Dong to reach the current stage that he was at now. A person and a marten had walked together for all these years and experienced numerous difficult trials together. In the end, they had endured all of those...\\n\\n “She should not remain much longer in this current state…” said Little Marten as he raised his head and looked at the young lady in midair.\\n\\n Little Marten’s prediction was spot on. After a few minutes, the icy blue colour that pervaded the skies started to grow weaker rapidly. After which, Ying Huanhuan’s icy cold eyes started to slowly shut once again.\\n\\n One by one, the layers of icy blue halos all reentered the Ying Huanhuan’s body before her extremely long icy blue hair rapidly shortened. As it was shortening, the icy blue colour receded and her original black hair rapidly reappeared.\\n\\n After Ying Huanhuan’s hair completely recovered its original colour, her body started to descend from the sky. Seeing this, Lin Dong took a step forward and hugged her by the waist. The soft waist that entered his hand caused him to shake slightly, before he lowered his head only to see that he was being stared straight by a young lady’s jet black eyes.\\n\\n The two of them continued to stare at each other and Lin Dong’s expression did not change at all. It was as if this ambiguous position had nothing to do with him. As for the young lady, after seeing the opposite party’s action, she finally resigned as a red embarrassed flush appeared on her fair and beautiful face.\\n\\n Looking at the embarrassed and resentful gaze from that young lady, Lin Dong breathed a quiet sigh of relief in his heart. That’s good, this was the Ying Huanhuan that he knew…\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-746","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
