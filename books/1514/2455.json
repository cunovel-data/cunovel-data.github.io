Endless amount of evil demonic aura continuously surged out from within, causing the surrounding temperature to fall. Meanwhile, the originally dense natural Yuan Power also scattered off, as if they had encountered some hateful creature. \\n\\n There were two figures standing in front of that swirl. They wore black clothes and they had disheveled black hair. Both of them looked fairly similar and they both looked sickly pale. Their lips were curled, giving them a sexy yet evil look.\\n\\n The both of them did not speak when they showed up. Nevertheless, everyone could feel an indescribable pressure enveloping the entire place. Every Celestial Demon Marten tribe member present, including the tribe leader, had a solemn expression on their typically calm faces.\\n\\n Two Yimo kings.\\n\\n That was two genuine Reincarnation stage experts. In fact, even their Celestial Demon Marten tribe did not dare to underestimate such a lineup. \\n\\n “Haha, so it’s actually the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. From the looks of it, you have actually managed to escape from the hallucination of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers?” The two Yimo kings somewhat lengthy eyes surveyed the place. After which, their eyes paused on the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader before they spoke with a laugh.\\n\\n “Two Yimo kings. This is quite a hefty sum. Looks like you guys have been eyeing my Celestial Demon Marten tribe for quite some time.” The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe replied in a faint voice.\\n\\n “State your names.”\\n\\n “Haha, I am the Heaven Illusion King.” One of the black clothed men smiled. If not for the evil demonic aura permeating over his face, he would have seemed like a scholarly individual.\\n\\n “I am the Earth Illusion King.” The other Yimo king smilingly said. \\n\\n “It turns out that even after you guys were defeated during the ancient great war, you guys still refuse to give up and your evil intent persists.” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader shook his head and said.\\n\\n “We only lost back then because your side had a Symbol Ancestor. Now that the Symbol Ancestor is dead, all life in this plane shall ultimately be under our control.” The Heaven Illusion King laughed.\\n\\n “Originally, we were planning to secretly eliminate all the top experts in your Celestial Demon Marten tribe. However, from the looks of it, it seems like our plan has been exposed.”\\n\\n The Earth Illusion King frowned slightly. After which, he turned to look at a kneeling Hao Jiuyou before he said in a faint voice, “Hao Jiuyou, you have truly let us down.”\\n\\n Hao Jiuyou’s body trembled. He clenched his teeth and said, “Sir, the main reason for this is because of that Lin Dong, who appeared out of nowhere. He entered the Heavenly Cave and rescued the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe.”\\n\\n “Oh?”\\n\\n The Heaven Illusion King duo had a slight change in their expressions. They rotated their eyes and looked at Lin Dong, who was standing beside the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. “A mere advance Profound Death stage human is actually able to handle the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers?”\\n\\n “The Ancestor Stone is in his hands. He should have used the Ancestor Stone to break the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers.” Hao Jiuyou explained.\\n\\n “The Ancestor Stone has actually landed in your hands?” A tinge of shock finally appeared on the Heaven Illusion King duo’s faces. As Yimo, they naturally knew about this powerful divine object, that was created by the Symbol Ancestor during the ancient times, in order to deal with their Yimo tribe.\\n\\n Lin Dong did not reply as he merely stared intently at the Heaven Illusion King duo. Meanwhile, Yuan Power rapidly circulated within his body, while Mental Energy filled his mind. Clearly, he had entered into his highest alert level. \\n\\n “However, you are far too weak. The Ancestor Stone will be of little use in your hands.”\\n\\n The Heaven Illusion King casually laughed before he quickly continued, “Forget about it. It doesn’t matter if our plan has been exposed. This situation is still within our expectations. However, Hao Jiuyou, if you did not complete the other part of the plan, I believe that there is no need for you to continue living.”\\n\\n “Sir, I have already done as you instructed. Everything is ready and we can begin at anytime.” Hao Jiuyou hurriedly replied.\\n\\n “Not bad.”\\n\\n The Heaven Illusion King finally nodded in satisfaction. After which, he looked at the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader, as well as the densely packed Celestial Demon Marten tribe experts, before he laughed, “Originally, I was planning to slowly weaken your Celestial Demon Marten tribe. However, from the looks of it, I can only take extreme measures now.”\\n\\n “I’m afraid that you don’t have the ability to do so!”\\n\\n The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe had an icy cold expression as he took a step forward. Terrifying Yuan Power ripples spread from him and it seemed as though the entire world began to tremble intensely at this very moment.\\n\\n It seems like this peak expert of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe could no longer control his killing desire and was about to make a move. \\n\\n “Activate the tribe guarding formation!” Zhu Li’s wore an icy cold expression as he cried out.\\n\\n “Understood!”\\n\\n Low and orderly cries reverberated across the sky. Soon after, many light pillars erupted from within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Following which, these light pillars entwined with each other and formed a pair of hundreds of thousand feet large brilliant bat wings. Then, the bat wings extended and enveloped the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Meanwhile, there were mighty and unfathomable ripples undulated on the bat wings.\\n\\n “Since you have arrived, you should stay here. Being killed by our Celestial Demon Marten tribe does not diminish your prestige as Yimo kings.” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader said in an indifferent voice.\\n\\n “Haha, indeed worthy of being the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. You guys are as arrogant as always.”\\n\\n The Heaven Illusion King duo laughed out loud. However, soon after, they shook their heads before a faint venomous expression climbed onto their faces, “However, the unlucky ones today might perhaps be your Celestial Demon Marten tribe.”\\n\\n “Although the both of you are powerful, I’m afraid that the both of you are too naive if you believe that the both of you alone can destroy my Celestial Demon Marten tribe.” The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe chuckled.\\n\\n “Is that so?”\\n\\n A grin appeared on the faces of the Heaven Illusion King duo. Soon after, they suddenly extended their fair hands and gently pressed them together. After which, the smile on the corner of their lips suddenly became cruel and brutal.\\n\\n “Endless Illusion.”\\n\\n The voice that was emitted from their mouths was icy cold and indifferent. Meanwhile, there was a rich murderous intent and a diseased insanity within their voices.\\n\\n “Buzz buzz!”\\n\\n The land suddenly began to tremble. After which, everyone saw black light breaking out from the peak of many surrounding mountains. The black light gathered together before they transformed into many black flowers, in front of the stunned eyes of Lin Dong’s group.\\n\\n They were Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers!\\n\\n “I have secretly buried the seeds of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers in the mountains, in the shape of a formation over the past hundred years. Now that the two great lords have activated them, the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe will be covered by the formation created by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. Therefore, there is nowhere for you guys to run!” Hao Jiuyou lifted his head. His expression was venomous as he stared at Lin Dong’s group and said with a laugh.\\n\\n “You bastard!”\\n\\n Zhu Li’s eyes were furious while his entire body trembled with anger. Never did he expect that Hao Jiuyou was actually scheming against their Celestial Demon Marten tribe over the last hundred years; to think that so many elders greatly trusted him.\\n\\n Many Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers swayed on the surrounding mountaintops. After which, a seemingly deafening sound wave was emitted before many black light rays spread. Finally, they turned into a black light cover that gradually enveloped the bat wings formation in the sky.\\n\\n As the black light cover began to spread, some of the weaker Celestial Demon Marten tribe members began to feel giddy. In fact, even their minds became somewhat blurry. This was a sign that they were about to descend into a hallucination.\\n\\n Lin Dong furrowed his brows tightly when he saw this scene. White warm light currently enveloped his body. Hence, thanks to the protection from the Ancestor Stone, this formation had little impact on him. However, for ordinary members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, the formation was extremely harmful towards them. \\n\\n “Tribe leader, what should we do?” Zhu Li looked at the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe with a grave expression, before he asked in a deep voice.\\n\\n “Currently, most of our top experts are in a cultivation seclusion within the Heavenly Cave. Moreover, they have also fallen into a hallucination and are unable to awaken quickly.” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe narrowed his eyes and said, “I will attack and stop a Yimo king. First elder, you will lead ten Samsara stage experts to handle the other Yimo king.”\\n\\n Currently, Zhu Li had already touched Reincarnation and his strength far surpassed that of an ordinary Samsara stage expert. Together with another ten ultimate Samsara stage experts, it was possible for him to stop a Yimo king.\\n\\n “However, that formation…”\\n\\n Zhu Li had a grave expression. The most troublesome matter was not those two Yimo kings. Instead, it was the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers formation that covered their entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe. That was because if the hallucination fragrance continued to accumulate, it was likely that even powerful Samsara stage experts would be affected. Hence, even less needed to be said about ordinary tribe members.\\n\\n The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe frowned. He could detect just how powerful that formation was. Clearly, the Yimo have made thorough preparations over the years and it was obvious that they wanted to deliver a massive blow to their Celestial Demon Marten tribe.\\n\\n “This formation seems to be made up of sixty-nine Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. It seems like they have truly spent a huge sum in order to deal with the Celestial Demon Marten tribe.” Standing beside them, Lin Dong’s sharp eyes swept across the many mountains before he said.\\n\\n It was relatively difficult to raise Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers and it required them to fork out a heavy price. However, the Yimo tribe was actually willing to use so many of them in order to deal with the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. This was truly a generous sum. \\n\\n “The hallucination fragrance of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flower is extremely powerful and even a Samsara stage expert does not dare to easily approach it.” Zhu Li said in a deep voice. Since the top experts in the Heavenly Cave had yet to awaken, they were currently severely short of manpower.\\n\\n A glint flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes after he heard this. After which, he stared intently at those black demonic flowers swaying on the surrounding mountaintops. There was a heated expression surging in his eyes. \\n\\n “First elder, leave that formation to me. The both of you only need to focus on dealing with the two Yimo kings.” Lin Dong smilingly said.\\n\\n “You?”\\n\\n The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe and Zhu Li were both startled.\\n\\n “Of course, I will also need some help.”\\n\\n Lin Dong smiled and said, “Do the both of you not trust me?”\\n\\n “Haha, if young friend Lin Dong can take care of the formation, my Celestial Demon Marten tribe will owe you a favor!” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe waved his hand and laughed.\\n\\n Lin Dong smiled before his eyes once again focused on those Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. Then, he involuntarily smacked his lips.\\n\\n There were so many Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers here. If he could obtain all of them, he would likely be able to advance to the Symbol Grandmaster level.\\n\\n This was truly… a big gift delivered to his doorstep.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1142","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
