Everyone stared in bewilderment at that man which had appeared next to Mo Tei.\n None of them had expected that Lin Dong could actually survive after being hunted down by five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts...\n Those were five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts. Everyone in the battlefield and even those half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioners’ expressions changed. That was because everyone knew that if they were in his shoes, there was no way they could return safely. However, right now, Lin Dong not only managed to shake off those five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts, he was even able to return safely.\n The shock caused by this sight was not a small one.\n The first ones to recover their senses were Mo Ling and the rest. They were the ones who knew Lin Dong best. Even though they were slightly worried when Lin Dong volunteered to lure away those five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts, they did not despair like the rest. That was because they knew that Lin Dong took risks that he was confident in. Since he volunteered himself, it indicated that he had the ability to tackle the problem.\n Therefore, when they saw Lin Dong resurface, delight surged into their faces. However, they were not stunned like the rest...\n “You…”\n While Mo Ling and the rest celebrated in delight, Mo Tei and the rest finally recovered their senses. As they stared at Lin Dong, it looked as if their eyes were about to pop out. After stuttering for a long while, they were still unable to mutter a complete sentence and they looked extremely slick and comical.\n “Oh my god. That fellow is actually alive!”\n “What dog shit luck is this? After being chased by five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts and jumping right into the demonic horde, he is still able to survive. That kid is truly blessed by the Heavens.”\n “Hehe, it seems like Jin Mu’s plan has failed. Someone has returned to collect a debt…”\n “That remains to be seen. There are five half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner on Jin Mu’s side and based on my intel, they are far more powerful than Mo Tei and the rest. Furthermore, it is reputed that Hai Sha is related to the Ling Yuan empire. Therefore, this is a tough debt to collect.”\n Amidst the whispers from the crowd, Jin Mu’s originally bewildered expression turned grim. As he stared venomously at Lin Dong, he chuckled: “What a lucky kid. I can’t even kill you after that.”\n Standing beside Jin Mu, Hai Sha tightly furrowed his brows as he stared at Lin Dong. Moments later, he softly said: “It’s a good thing he is alive. I was worried that if he died inside the demonic horde, we would lose his Soul Treasures…”\n Even though Lin Dong’s appearance shocked him, he was not too worried. After all, they were five half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioners on their side. Therefore, were they afraid that Lin Dong could overrun them?\n “Brother Lin Dong, you are going to be the death of me.” Right now, Mo Tei had calmed himself down. Promptly, he walked over to Lin Dong before he softly said: “So, what do you plan to do now?”\n Mo Tei’s words evidently indicated that he was asking for Lin Dong’s opinion. Even though he barely knew the latter, he knew that he was not a man to be taken advantage of. Furthermore, Jin Mu and Hai Sha’s actions tonight were simply too despicable.\n However, even though he was outraged, after calming down, he began to calculate the difference between their side. After glancing at those five-half-step to Nirvana stage practitioners, he finally concluded that their were indeed more powerful than them.\n When he heard Mo Tei’s words, Lin Dong’s slightly icy-cold eyes gently swept across Jin Mu and the rest, while a killing aura faintly emerged. With regards to Jin Mu, he had reached his boiling point. After all, he did not want to have an enemy by his side secretly awaiting to backstab him. He did not want to experience again what he did tonight. Therefore...\n Tonight, Jin Mu must die!\n When he saw the killing intent flowing in Lin Dong’s eyes, Mo Tei’s pupils gently shrunk. Promptly, he knew that there was no way to peacefully conclude the night.\n “Pfft, Lin Dong, since you are lucky enough to survive, you should treasure your life. Don’t dream of making any stupid moves as it will only result in your own death!” Jin Mu also detected the killing intent in Lin Dong’s eyes. Immediately, his eyes turned cold as he coldly shouted out.\n Lin Dong’s face was calm and he did not reply. Then, he took a step forward before his Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear immediately appeared in his hand. Meanwhile, his killing intent finally gushed forth and alerted everyone to his intentions.\n Gush. Swoosh. Swoosh.\n Everyone nearby immediately retreated and left a large circle between them. Everyone knew that there was going to be another earth-shattering battle tonight.\n “Lin Dong, since you insist on digging your own grave, don’t blame us!” A formidable cold glint flashed in Jin Mu’s eyes. Standing beside him, Hai Sha and the three other half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioners also took a step forward. Instantly, five powerful auras erupted forth and it was shocking enough to cause one’s expression to change.\n “Bullying others using your superior numbers. Do you really believe that we are afraid of you!” Mo Tei coldly snorted, before he brought along the Tang Xuan duo and walked out. They had no intention of backing down.\n When Mo Tei and the rest made their move, the atmosphere in the battlefield instantly turned tense.\n “Mo Ling, have you guys mastered the formation that I taught you?” When he saw this sight, Lin Dong suddenly tilted his head and turned to Mo Ling and the rest and said.\n “Even though we cannot defeat a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner, we can hold one of them down.” When he heard his words, Mo Ling and the rest instantly replied eagerly. They were eager to test out just how powerful the formation was.\n “Leave Jin Mu to me. The three of you can handle one of them.”\n Brother Mo Tei, please help me to take care of the other three. I will finish Jin Mu off quickly.” Lin Dong turned to Mo Tei and the two of them, before he said.\n “You wish to fight against Jin Mu by yourself?” When he heard his words, Tang Xuan was slightly stunned. However, as she recalled Lin Dong’s past performance, she gradually nodded her head.\n “In that case, let’s… go!”\n When that final word left Lin Dong’s mouth, that tense atmosphere instantly exploded. Behind him, a figure directly transformed into a black shadow. Then, formidable bone shadows transformed into a flowery spear dance as it swept towards Jin Mu.\n “I was caught off guard the previous time. Do you really believe that you can accomplish the same result as before?!”\n When he saw Lin Dong charging towards him, Jin Mu’s coldly shouted out,before a formidable Yuan Power shockwave swept forth from within his body. Then, he directly clashed against Lin Dong.\n When that savage Yuan Power shockwind swept forth, a cold glint flashed across Mo Ling, Mo Tei and the rest’s eyes. Promptly, their figures flashed before they managed to completely intercept Hai Sha and the three other half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioners.\n Boom! Boom! Boom!\n After previously experiencing a massive battle, another violent commotion erupted in the mountain range. As they stared at that fearsome fight, troops from the other factions quickly retreated. However, while they were observing the fight, even though they were extremely outraged by Jin Mu’s actions, it had to be said that Mo Tei’s faction was indeed at a disadvantage. After all, Jin Mu’s side had five genuine half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioners...\n “Ding Ding Dang Dang!”\n Formidable spear shadows filled with a icy-cold aura, flew at a peculiar trajectory towards Jin Mu’s vital points. Meanwhile, the latter obviously knew the might of Lin Dong’s bone spear, as his feet executed a mysterious footsteps. At the same time, flames lit up on the fiery-red steel rod in his hand, as he countered against that spear dance.\n “Pfft, Lin Dong. Your three peak Manifestation followers actually dare to fight against a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner. You must be hoping that they can hold them off for a while? However, you must be dreaming. After my ally finishes them off, it will be your turn next!”\n A spear and rod mixed with savage Yuan Power continuously crossed blows in mid-air, while Jin Mu pushed all the Yuan Power in his body till his limit. Since he knew that Lin Dong was a tricky opponent, he had no intention of defeating him. As long as he could stall him and wait for his half-step-to Nirvana stage allies to assist him, they could surround Lin Dong and easily slaughter him.\n “Before they fall, you will be a dead man!”\n A venomous smile suddenly emerged on Lin Dong’s face. Promptly, a resplendent golden glow erupted on Lin Dong’s skin. As that golden glow flowed, an extremely terrifying energy erupted forth just like a volcano.\n An energy tattoo swiftly extended across Lin Dong’s body. When he sensed that vibration, Jin Mu’s pupils suddenly shrunk. That was because he realized that compared to their previous encounter, Lin Dong had actually grown much stronger!\n While the golden glow flowed, Lin Dong’s entire body seemed to have transformed into a golden flash. Meanwhile, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear in his hand was wrapped by a layer of gold.\n After advancing to peak Manifestation stage, Lin Dong’s Lesser Nirvana Golden Body had improved once again. Even though he had not reached complete mastery, he had a pretty decent mastery of it!\n “Swoosh!”\n Lin Dong’s body seeming transformed into a golden glow. Men and spear fused together in that golden glow. Soon after, that golden glow tore through the horizons at a terrifying rate, just like a golden shooting star flashing across the nightsky. With a formidable force, it charged towards Jin Mu.\n That commotion immediately drew the attention from everyone in the battlefield. As they sensed that terrifying vibration undulated on that golden glow, even some Nirvana stage practitioners’ expressions turned grim. After all, they could smell a potent deadly scent emerging from within.\n “Saint Elephant Sky Crumbling Tackle!”\n Every hair on Jin Mu’s body stood up. He could sense just how powerful Lin Dong’s killing move was. Immediately, he did not dare to be negligent at all as he directly executed his most powerful martial arts.\n A giant glowing elephant materialized before it wrapped around Jin Mu. With an aura that could shock the heavens, it charged towards that golden glow.\n The air in the horizons trembled. Nobody had expected that the battle would heat up this quickly. In fact, even Mo Tei, Hai Sha and the rest involuntarily turned to look at that sight.\n “Boom!”\n An earth-shattering collision finally occurred under the stares of the crowd. Then, the crowd immediately saw that golden glow shrink instantly, before all the energy was concentrated on the tip of a golden spear.\n “Might Of Golden Body, Break!”\n A deep roar rumbled forth, while the resplendent golden glow on the tip of that spear seemingly tore through the night sky.\n “Bang!”\n A resplendent golden glow was reflected in everyone’s pupils. Thanks to that flowing golden glow, it instantly tore apart that incoming large glowing elephant...\n “Buzz Chhh!”\n That large glowing elephant was instantly ripped savagely apart. Meanwhile, Jin Mu, who was located within, stared at that golden glow that was rapidly growing in his eyes, while thick fear finally flowed in his eyes.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-436","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
