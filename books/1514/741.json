The Yuan Power within his body was circulating in a crazy fashion as he tried to break free.\\n\\n Chi chi!\\n\\n However, while the Yuan Power within his body was circulating, a cold smile flashed across Lin Dong’s face. After which, countless black light rays suddenly surfaced on the green dragon palm. These light rays swarmed around Shen Yun’s throat with lightning like speed.\\n\\n The expression on Shen Yun’s face stiffened the moment these light rays covered him. This was because he was horrified to discover that the Yuan Power within his body was rapidly vanishing at this moment. The reason why his Yuan Power disappeared was because of the palm gripping on his throat.\\n\\n The Yuan Power within his body was actually being devoured by Lin Dong!\\n\\n Shen Yun felt like his heart was being ruthlessly gripped by a large hand. His eyes were filled with disbelief as he stared intently at Lin Dong. Furthermore, he realized that as the Yuan Power within his body was being devoured, the green light that surged on Lin Dong’s body grew increasingly rich!\\n\\n This scene caused a chillness to rise from under his feet. He was truly unable to believe that Lin Dong was not only able to devour the Yuan Power in his body, but he was also able to utilize it.\\n\\n This… Shen Yun’s eyes shrunk in a wild manner. A moment later, he suddenly thought of something. An indistinct and shocked voice was emitted between his teeth, “Devouring… Devouring Ancestral Symbol?”\\n\\n Lin Dong’s eyes narrowed slightly when these vague words landed in his ears. He had hardly used his Devouring Ancestral Symbol when fighting with others in the past. This was because that item was far too obvious. Anyone with a basic understanding of it would be able to guess its identity. Moreover, he clearly understood that if he was to expose such a great treasure while roaming around, he would definitely attract much unwanted attention.\\n\\n The reason why he used Devouring Force was naturally because he did not plan to leave any survivors behind. Otherwise, if Yuan Gate knew that he possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, it might end up attracting a great amount of trouble.\\n\\n “Congratulations, you are correct. The prize shall be your life...” Lin Dong smiled at Shen Yun. That smile caused Shen Yun’s body to be covered by a chill air.\\n\\n Shen Yun struggled with all his might. The Yuan Power within his body also swiftly disappeared, causing his expression to gradually turn pale. At this moment, he finally understood how fiendish his opponent was…\\n\\n Crack!\\n\\n Lin Dong’s eyes were indifferent. A force was suddenly emitted from the dragon arm. A slight sound was emitted before the Shen Yun’s struggling body immediately stiffened. The expression on his face completely hardened. One could see some remnant shock and horror in his eyes.\\n\\n One of the eight soul generals of the Yuan Gate had completely fallen in this wilderness.\\n\\n “You… you killed him?”\\n\\n Ying Huanhuan hugged the Heavenly Phoenix Zither and rushed over at this moment. She muttered, feeling a little shaken as she watched Shen Yun’s body gradually turning icy cold in Lin Dong’s hand.\\n\\n “What else should I do then?” Lin Dong turned his head, stared at Ying Huanhuan and asked.\\n\\n At this moment, the indifference in Lin Dong’s eyes had yet to completely disappear. Ying Huanhuan’s small face turned pale when she saw this. The current Lin Dong had clearly frightened her.\\n\\n “This fellow hurt you previously. If I do not kill him, what should I do in the event that you return and complain about me? Would the seniors in Dao Sect let me off?” Lin Dong had also recovered from that state at this moment. He looked at Ying Huanhuan’s rare timid manner before an apologetic glint involuntarily flashed across his eyes. He immediately replied in a gentle voice.\\n\\n “If you kill him… it’s just as well. The Great Sect Competition is approaching. Let them lose a soul general. It will cause them to suffer for quite a while.” Ying Huanhuan quietly sighed when she saw that Lin Dong’s eyes had once again recovered to their usual gentleness. She tilted her head, thought for a moment, and said.\\n\\n “Heh, they will be losing more than one soul general, but two, along with one Elder.”\\n\\n Lin Dong smiled. Immediately, he looked at Ying Huanhuan, who was so shocked that her mouth was ajar. He continued, “Since we have already made a move, we should leave no loose ends behind. Else, it would be a little troublesome if Yuan Gate becomes aware of it.”\\n\\n Ying Huanhuan hesitated for a moment and nodded. If she was the one doing it, she would definitely not be as vicious and decisive as Lin Dong. However, she also understood that Lin Dong’s decision was the right one.\\n\\n Lin Dong’s eyes turned towards the battleground in the distant sky. He immediately smiled coldly. His hand grabbed Shen Yun’s corpse and cried out explosively, “Aren’t the people from Yuan Gate a little too useless?”\\n\\n Lin Dong’s cry was just like a thunder that rumbled and spread across the sky. The brown robed old man and Xia Yan, who were engaged in an intense battle, hurriedly turned around. After which, their expressions changed drastically when they saw the icy cold corpse in Lin Dong’s hand.\\n\\n “Brat, you actually dare to kill a disciple of my Yuan Gate. Do you wish to start a war?” That old man called Elder Jiang, had an incomparably shady face as he cried out in a dense voice.\\n\\n “So only your Yuan Gate disciples are allowed to kill my Dao Sect’s disciples?” Lin Dong laughed.\\n\\n “Brat, just you wait. You will definitely die once news of this matter reaches my Yuan Gate!” Xia Yan\u0027s expression was dark and vicious while he cried out in a stern voice.\\n\\n “You can die now!”\\n\\n Xia Yan’s stern cry had just sounded out when a tiger-like roar was suddenly transmitted over from his front. After which, that tiger roar shook the sky. The former hurriedly turned his head around, only to see Little Flame’s body shaking wildly. It actually transformed into a large black tiger. Monstrous black light swept over wildly while a fearsome aura permeated over the place.\\n\\n “Heaven Devil Tiger tribe?” Xia Yan’s pupils shrunk immediately as he cried out in shock when he saw the enormous black tiger and the mysterious lines over it.\\n\\n “Heavenly Devil Divine Transformation, Tiger Ancestral Star Shattering Palm!”\\n\\n A low and deep roar that was accompanied by a fearsome evil aura spread forth. The tiger palm of that enormous black tiger slammed out fiercely. The black light turned into countless number of black swirls under his palm. Those black swirls appeared to be connected to the ancient times. An extremely terrifying fierce and evil pressure was emitted from within.\\n\\n “Golden Mountain Divine Hall, Golden Mountain Crushing World!”\\n\\n Faced with this shocking attack by Little Flame, the expression of Xia Yan also changed drastically. He did not dare to slight his attack. Yuan Power within his body came spluttering out. A monstrous golden light surged and actually transformed into a golden mountain before violently smashing furiously onto the enormous black tiger that was rushing over.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n Black and gold began to sweep wildly across the sky at this moment. Each of them occupied half of the sky.\\n\\n Bang bang!\\n\\n Frightening energy fluctuation spread apart. Xia Yan’s body flew backwards by a couple of hundred metres at that moment. A mouthful of fresh blood was wildly spat out and his aura rapidly turned sluggish. On the other hand, the enormous black tiger that Little Flame had transformed into relied on the constitution of a Demonic Beast to endure that collision.\\n\\n The two engaged in an all-out collision and the stronger of the two was obvious!\\n\\n Swoosh!\\n\\n A scarlet colour swarmed into the enormous eyes of the black tiger after having endured the attack. The tiger suddenly leaped and appeared in front of Xia Yan, who had a sluggish aura, in a flash. The tiger palm whistled pass and violently slammed onto the latter’s chest.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n Xia Yan’s body once again flew backwards. The golden light on his body rapidly dimmed. Finally, it ruthlessly shot into the sea of trees below, rubbing against the ground and forming a deep scar that was a couple of thousand feet long.\\n\\n Gurg.\\n\\n Xia Yan, whose body was covered in mud and blood, struggled to climb to his feet on the ground. At this moment, the haughtiness on his face had completely disappeared. A shocked expression replaced it. Immediately, he directly turned around and fled.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n However, while he was still turning around, the enormous black tiger came leaping over in a flash. It blocked the former like a small mountain. A tiger palm was extended in a lightning like fashion and immediately slammed furiously onto Xia Yan’s head. The ground shook and the latter was forcefully slammed deep into the ground. After which, crimson blood gushed out from the deep hole. Xia Yan’s aura also vanished almost instantly.\\n\\n A glow finally surged on the enormous black tiger after it killed Xia Yan with a slam of its palm as it transformed back into a human. Little Flame parted his mouth. His expression was as fierce and evil as a devil, causing one to tremble despite not feeling cold.\\n\\n “Good, good, what vicious tactics!”\\n\\n The miserable death of Xia Yan was clearly captured in Elder Jiang’s eyes. Immediately, his eyes looked as though they were about to crack. A rich viciousness spread within his eyes as he roared, “All of you will regret it. The fury of my Yuan Gate will cause your Dao Sect to regret!”\\n\\n “Old fart, you can be rest assured that the news here will not be leaked.” Little Marten laughed faintly when faced with Elder Jiang’s roar.\\n\\n “I admit that I have misjudged all of you this time around. However, though I might not be able to finish you off, but do you have the qualification to stop me if I wish to leave?” Elder Jiang laughed furiously.\\n\\n “Since we are going to finish you off… it is likely that I do not need to hide my identity…”\\n\\n A smile spread over Little Marten’s handsome face. Immediately, the seal formed by his hands changed. Monstrous purple-black light swept out from his body. After which, a pair of thousand feet large purple-black bat wings spread out from his back and blotted out the sun. At the same time, a frightening fluctuation that belonged to his tribe also spread out.\\n\\n “This is…”\\n\\n The eyes of Elder Jiang and the Yellow Golden Ghost Owl instantly shrunk when they saw the thousand feet large purple-black bat wings on Little Marten’s back. In fact, the latter’s expression suddenly turned ashen while rich horror gushed out from his eyes.\\n\\n “Celestial Demon Marten?”\\n\\n Involuntarily a shocked cry was dryly emitted from their mouths at this moment.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-739","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
