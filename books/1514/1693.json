A scarlet and bloody light slowly emerged from the sinister blood spear like thick, sticky blood while a thick bloody qi slowly extended across the large hall. “Blood Demonic Asura Spear!” When the sinister blood spear appeared, Lin Dong’s expression suddenly changed. Promptly, his expression turned exceedingly solemn. Before he came here, he had gathered all kinds of information about the Wang Clan. Among them was the Wang Clan’s lethal weapon, the Blood Demonic Asura Spear! It was said that this Blood Demonic Asura Spear was bestowed upon the Wang Clan after one of their ancestors was chosen by a super sect! Even though it was an Earthly Soul Treasure, the spear was filled with a bloody aura. After being constantly corroded by the bloody aura, the treasure spirit turned into a blood spirit which was extremely vicious. Over the years, several elite Wang Clan practitioners had tried to subdue it, however all of them suffered severe backlash. In fact, the most unlucky one even directly lost his life. This fact caused the spear to acquire an infamous reputation. However, he never expected Wang Zhong to actually use it! “Since you are able to force me to use the Blood Demonic Asura Spear, even if you lose, there is nothing to regret!” Wang Zhong grabbed his blood spear as a line of blood appeared in his eyes. Right now, every word that he spoke was filled with a potent bloody qi, causing the blood in one’s body to tremble. “Buzz!” Wang Zhong obviously did not want to give Lin Dong much time. Blood spear in hand, he violently stomped the ground, instantly causing cracks appeared on the solid ground. A weird soundwave appeared on the tip of the spear and quickly spread outwards. When Lin Dong saw the peculiar soundwave, his expression darkened. He had discovered that when that soundwave swarmed towards him, the blood inside his body started to boil. It felt as if all his blood was about to break out of his body. “What a peculiar spear, it can actually affect the blood inside one’s body!” Lin Dong’s eyes narrowed a little. With a flick of his mind, a microscopic Devouring Force emerged from his body and directly swallowed all the soundwaves that were forcibly encroaching on his body. “Swoosh!” Just as Lin Dong was countering the peculiar soundwave, the blood lines inside Wang Zhong’s eyes intensified. His body transformed into a bloody flash as he dashed forth. As he swung the blood spear in his hand, a series of formidable spear shadows rapidly appeared and attacked Lin Dong’s vital spots. The force was so terrifyingly that it left several deep marks on this specially-made ground. “Ding! Ding! Ding!’ As he faced Wang Zhong’s formidable attack, Lin Dong did not dare to be negligent at all. The ancient halberd suddenly appeared followed by several halberd shadows which clashed against those formidable spear shadows. Crisp metallic sounds continuously sounded out in the large hall, while two figures flashed like ghosts. Every time they crossed blows, an exceedingly savage energy shockwave erupted. “Bang!” In the large hall, two figures once again collided with formidable force in mid-air as a savage shockwave swept outwards. One of the figures was blown back a dozen feet, before he slammed against a large stone pillar. It was Lin Dong! Based on the situation, it seemed like Lin Dong was actually on the losing end after the previous exchange. As expected, Wang Zhong was indeed very powerful. Furthermore, when Lin Dong slammed against the stone pillar, there were traces of bloody qi on his ancient halberd. The bloody qi continuously invaded his ancient halberd, and even began to bore into Lin Dong’s body. Based on this sight, it was clear that during their previous bout, the peculiar and evil bloody qi on Wang Zhong’s Blood Demonic Asura Spear had unknowingly attacked the ancient halberd. The lethal weapon truly lived up to its name. “Lin Dong, with just your high-grade Soul Treasure, you are unable to withstand the blood qi of my Blood Demonic Asura Spear!” As he watched the activity on Lin Dong’s ancient halberd, Wang Zhong chuckled as he said. “Pfft, what bloody qi. It is no big deal to me!” When he heard these words, Lin Dong snorted instead. He stretched his palm out and wiped it along the ancient halberd. A Devouring Force gushed out and directly swallowed that venomous bloody qi. When he saw this sight, Wang Zhong’s gently furrowed his brows. The Blood Demonic Asura Spear’s bloody qi was exceedingly formidable and it was even able to corrode a Soul Treasure. In the face of such a situation, even an advanced Manifestation stage practitioner would be troubled. However, he never expected that Lin Dong would handle it so easily... Wang Zhong was confused. He naturally did not know that even though the bloody qi on his Blood Demonic Asura Spear was powerful, when it met the only Devouring Ancient Symbol in this world, it was unable to assert itself at all. “Eye of Asura!” When his attack failed, the line of blood in Wang Zhong’s eyes intensified. Promptly, his hand seals changed as the bloody mist around his Blood Demonic Asura spear quickly swirled, before directly materializing into a peculiar blood eyeball! “Swoosh!” When the blood eyeball appeared, all of the bloody mist surrounding the Blood Demonic Asura Spear instantly gathered towards it. A bloody glow gushed out from the eyeball as a thumb-sized bloody beam viciously shot towards Lin Dong! When the bloody beam appeared, all the surrounding air seemed to have fled instantly, creating a vacuum, which caused its speed to increase even further. The bloody beam grew quickly in Lin Dong’s eyes, while his expression turned increasingly solemn. Even he felt an extreme dangerous from the bloody beam. “Boom!” His eyes glimmering, Lin Dong did not dare to hold back at all. He opened his mouth as a black beam howled out. It slowly expanded before it transformed into a mountain peak that was several feet large. A black glow flickered on the mountain peak as it ferociously slammed against the bloody beam. “Bang!” When the parties collided, an extremely savage energy shockwave instantly swept forth. Immediately, the stone pillars nearby were all directly blown to pieces. “Earthly Soul Treasure?” When he saw this sight, Wang Zhong’s expression became slightly solemn. As he stared at that black mountain peak, a contemplative look flashed across his eyes. Moments later, as if he had realized something, his body trembled, while his tone was filled with an extra tinge of shock: “Is that the Lin Clan’s Heavy Prison Peak? No one could control that treasure for so many years, yet you were actually able to subdue it?” “Heh, since you can subdue the Blood Demonic Asura Spear, why can’t I subdue this Heavy Prison Peak? Now that you had your turn, it\u0027s my turn now!” Lin Dong chuckled. Promptly, his figure flashed and appeared on top of the Heavy Prison Peak. Several blazing suns arose from his body and hovered above his head. Right now, Lin Dong’s entire body was covered by a resplendent glow. At the same time, streams of power that caused even Wang Zhong’s face to change slowly emerged from Lin Dong’s body. “Six Sun Move Mountains!” A deep roar emerged from within the blinding light. Lin Dong bent his body as his hands gripped the peak of the Heavy Prison Peak. Instantly, the entire mountain was forcibly lifted by him. As he took a step forward, it looked as if a tiny person was carrying a mountain, viciously waving it before flinging it at Wang Zhong’s head. Lin Dong’s attack was extremely terrifying. Currently, the Heavy Prison Peak had ballooned till it was several hundred feet large, making Lin Dong look like an ant. However, his ant-like body was able to lift the Heavy Prison Peak. This sight caused Wang Zhong’s eyelids to twitch. In fact, even Lin Fan and the rest, who were outside of the large hall, were in shock. After all, even a peak Manifestation stage practitioner could not lift the Heavy Prison Peak... Bang! Bang! Bang! In the large hall, the layers of air seemed to explode while terrifyingly waves of air swept forth, causing the surrounding stone pillars to explode. The current Lin Dong was evidently squeezing out every ounce of strength from within his body. Together with the terrifying size of the Heavy Prison Peak, even a peak Manifestation stage practitioner would not dare to face it head on! “Wang Zhong, try to receive this mountain of mine!” Filled with a challenging tone, Lin Dong’s deep growl echoed out from within the sounds of wind. “Humph! Did you really think that you can stop me?!” When he heard Lin Dong’s low growl, Wang Zhong’s eyes turned ice-cold. He bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of essence blood on his Blood Demonic Asura Spear. Instantly, the bloody glow on the spear gushed forth and extended across the horizon. “Asura Bloodsoul, Now!” The lines of blood in Wang Zhong’s eyes intensified, until eventually, he furiously roared while his hand seals rapidly changed. As Wang Zhong’s hand seals changed, the extending bloody glow as well as the Blood Demonic Asura Spear swiftly converged together. In a blink of an eye, a gigantic blurry and bloody figure, with an overwhelming bloody qi, slowly appeared in the large hall! When the bloody figure appeared, Lin Dong swung the gigantic mountain peak that brought with it a potent destructive power as it mercilessly flew out!
