However, the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile is no ordinary Demonic Beast. It was definitely an extremely powerful entity when it was alive. Therefore, there is nothing unbelievable about it being able to create Soul Treasures,” Little Marten curled its lips as it felt that Lin Dong was making a big fuss about nothing.\n Lin Dong did not really care about Little Marten’s look. Instead, he was looking curiously at the unadorned bone spear. Due to the increase in his powers, even the high grade Soul Treasure, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd, could no longer satisfy Lin Dong’s fighting needs. The appearance of the bone spear could make up for that.\n Faintly discernable energy waves were emitting from the bone spear. Lin Dong knew that this bone spear was definitely not weaker than an Earthly Soul Treasure. However, he did not know how much stronger it would be than the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd.\n As Little Marten waved its paws, the bone spear flew towards Lin Dong. With a blazing look in his eyes, the latter reached out and caught the spear. Immediately, his entire arm sank a little. The seemingly light and graceful bone spear actually weighed no less than a ten thousand catty boulder. Even with Lin Dong’s strength, he found it hard to balance the spear.\n “Excellent spear!”\n Lin Dong praised the spear. Upon observing the bone spear at a closer distance, he discovered that there were fine blood streaks spreading out from the handle of the bone spear. These blood streaks covered almost the entire body of the spear, making it look like blood vessels, an extremely bizarre sight.\n Furthermore, these blood vessels appeared to be slowly pulsating while the faint smell of a vast ancient wasteland gradually spread out. This further bolstered the spear’s austere aura.\n “For an Ancient Heavenly Crocodile of this level, any part of its skeleton is comparable to an ordinary Earthly Soul Treasure. This bone spear clearly was created from the hardest part within the heavenly crocodile’s body. Furthermore, because this bone spear was a Heavenly Crocodile’s Destiny Soul Treasure, it has been imbued with some remnants of the Heavenly Crocodile’s Demonic Spirit when it faded from the world. If you can refine this weapon, you may be able to use the Demonic Spirit remnants to summon the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit to fight for you…” Little Marten explained unenthusiastically.\n “Oh? Summon the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit?” Lin Dong’s face flushed with emotions after he heard what Little Marten said. He did not expect this plain-looking bone spear to possess such a formidable ability. Even though Lin Dong was unsure of how powerful the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile was when it was alive, he believed that its level of power was unimaginable. An illusionary Demonic Spirit at that level could not be matched by an ordinary Earthly Soul Treasure.\n “Of course, you have to pay a certain price to summon the heavenly crocodile’s Demonic Spirit. For example, blood sacrifice and so on…” Little Marten lazily said.\n “Blood sacrifice, my blood?” Lin Dong was startled. This felt a little like hurting oneself to kill one’s enemies.\n “Tsk, what use can your blood be? You overestimated your capabilities too much.” Little Marten rolled its eyes when it heard Lin Dong’s words, causing the corners of his mouth to twitch a little.\n “Powerful Demonic Beasts’ essence blood must be used to summon the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit. The kind that are far more stronger than the Ancient Dragon Ape in your body…” Little Marten explained.\n Upon hearing these words, Lin Dong was momentarily stunned, before his brows tightly furrowed. If the Demonic Beast was stronger than the Ancient Dragon Ape, wouldn’t its level be near to the Nirvana stage? Where could he obtain such precious essence blood? As he thought of this, Lin Dong could not help but feel disappointed. Initially, he had believed that he could create another trump card with this Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear...\n “You have a type of essence blood that fulfills this condition,” however, Little Marten suddenly blurted out when it saw how disappointed Lin Dong was.\n “Oh?” Lin Dong was a little stunned as he looked towards Little Marten. After thinking for a long time, he still could not think of any essence blood he possessed that fulfilled this condition.\n “The Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd. Within the ancient halberd, there is a trace of dragon essence blood. Even though it is not too pure, it can still be used for the blood sacrifice and summon the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit to fight for you,” Little Marten explained while pointing towards Lin Dong’s Qiankun bag.\n “The Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd?” After hearing Little Marten’s words, Lin Dong came to a realization. There was indeed a fine trace of dragon essence blood inside the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd. Even though the owner of the dragon essence blood was not an actual dragon, it would still work. That was because in the world of Demonic Beasts, as long as there was any relationship with the word ‘dragon’, it would suffice. Therefore, if this bit of dragon essence blood was used, there would be a possibility of summoning the heavenly crocodile’s Demonic Spirit.\n However, has only concern was that if the dragon essence blood was drawn out from the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd, Lin Dong’s first high grade Soul Treasure would be ruined.\n “Don’t worry. The Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear is already pretty powerful. Plus, with the Blood Puppet Soul as your guardian, you will be able to escape unharmed even if you encounter a Nirvana stage practitioner like Lin Fan. Of course, if there ever comes a time that you need to summon the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit, it would mean that you have encountered fatal danger. By then, it is definitely worthwhile to exchange the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd for your life,” Little Marten plainly said.\n Lin Dong laughed bitterly. Of course, there was nothing unacceptable in losing the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd to save his life.\n “You must hurry up and refine the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. As for whether you can refine the bone spear before entering the ancient battlefield, it will depend on your capabilities. Because the bone spear contains traces of the heavenly crocodile Demonic Spirit, it will not be an easy task to refine it. Of course, if you are able to refine the weapon successfully before entering the ancient battlefield, you will have more tricks to stay alive…” Little Marten elaborated as it stretched its body.\n “Alright.”\n Lin Dong gently nodded his head as a solemn look flashed across his eyes. He knew that time was running out. Hence, without wasting anymore time, he went to his room and sat cross-legged on the bed. As he took in a deep breath of air and relaxed his hands, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear levitated and hovered in front of him. It constantly gave off waves of austere aura which seemed to be accompanied by a faint, low and ancient roar...\n Lin Dong stared at the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. After a while, he slowly closed his eyes. With a thought, waves of vigorous Mental Energy began to flood out from Lin Dong’s Niwan Palace and rapidly gather in front of him. With a popping sound, balls of Mental Energy fire were created.\n Since Lin Dong was a high rank Soul Symbol Master his ability to create Mental Energy fire was much more proficient than it was in the past.\n “Go!”\n As Lin Dong pointed his finger forward, the balls of Mental Energy fire immediately whizzed through the air and engulfed the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. Suddenly, sizzling sounds erupted from the bone spear as the numerous blood streaks on the bone spear began to revolve at a great speed. At this moment, it was as if the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear had come to life!\n “Boom!”\n A mighty shockwave erupted from the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear and swept across the air, causing even the Mental Energy fire to be jolted back a little. With a ferocious sweep, the bone spear tore apart the Mental Energy fire, transforming into a flash of grey light before trying to escape.\n “Humph, I don’t care how powerful you were when you were alive, but now, how can you resist when even a Demonic Spirit does not exist!” Upon seeing the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear put up such a fierce resistance, Lin Dong eyes darkened. With a thought, powerful Mental Energy enshrouded the entire room, transforming into numerous threads which tightly wrapped around the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. It was as if the bone spear was caught in quicksand, and no matter how much it struggled, it could not escape.\n Upon seeing this, Lin Dong changed his hand seal again. A stronger than before Mental Energy fire engulfed the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear once again.\n “Creak! Creak!”\n Facing such an intense calcination by the Mental Energy fire, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear emitted some peculiar sounds. Traces of blood mist seeped out from the body of the spear and coagulated to become a mini heavenly crocodile. The heavenly crocodile struggled frantically in the Mental Energy fire and even tried to pounce on Lin Dong.\n Lin Dong calmly watched this scene. After all, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear was an Earthly Soul Treasure which possessed some spirit. In addition to the influence of the heavenly crocodile’s tyrannical nature, it would not be an easy task to refine it. However, he was not worried. The Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear was admittedly powerful, but without any reinforcements and in the face of his Mental Energy fire, it would soon give up...\n Lin Dong held this mentality as he slowly closed his eyes. Threads of Mental Energy constantly flowed out to form Mental Energy fire, which in turn engulfed the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear.\n This refining would last for five full days.\n As Lin Dong had predicted, under his constant calcination, the tyrannical aura of the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear weakened day by day. When the fifth day arrived, the small heavenly crocodile had disintegrated into a bloody mist and returned to the bone spear. The bone spear no longer struggled so much as well. Under the constant calcination over the past five days, the tyrannical aura of the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear had completely disappeared and everything had been refined….\n As the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear began to calm down, Lin Dong’s eyes, which had been shut tight for five days, opened once again. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat some essence blood onto the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. Under the calcination of the Mental Energy fire, the blood formed numerous blood markings along the bone spear.\n As the blood markings were formed, they slowly wiggled and fused together at a slow speed. Faintly, they appeared to form a brand made from fresh blood.\n When the blood brand appeared, Lin Dong could feel that he now had total control over the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear!\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-396","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
