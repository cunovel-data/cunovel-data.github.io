{"id":60911,"no":1155,"title":"Chapter 1153: Out","content":"The vast and mighty Mental Energy, which pervaded the land, persisted for a while before it finally began to pull back like a receding tide. Within a short span of several breaths, the land regained its silence once more. In a certain cave within the Heavenly Cave, Lin Dong’s eyes, which had been tightly shut for a long time, slowly opened. No light surged within those pitch-black eyes. The only things within them was an abstruse night like feeling and a blankness from not having adapted to his surroundings. The light within the quiet cave appeared rather gentle while the fresh smell of soil penetrated the smooth cave walls. Such tranquility made one subconsciously relax. However, this tranquil atmosphere felt extremely foreign as he stared at it. Although his appearance had not changed, the expression surging within his eyes made it seem as if he had been cut off from this world. Only three months had passed in the outside world. However, Lin Dong had spent over a decade within the lonely Purgatory… this was not a short period of time. During these ten years, he had not rested as he was constantly struggling within the cruel Purgatory. Yan stood by the side and quietly watched Lin Dong, whose blank gaze contained feelings of unfamiliarity. He did not speak out to the latter. This was normal. However, he believed that Lin Dong would be able to very quickly recover and regain his memory from before he entered Purgatory. Candle light swayed within the quiet cave. Lin Dong silently sat on the stone platform for the greater part of the day. Finally, he deeply inhaled a breath of air as his face began to regain the expression that Yan was familiar with. “How much time has passed outside?” Lin Dong lifted his head and smiled as he looked at Yan and asked. “Only three months.” Yan replied. “Only three months huh…” Lin Dong’s expression was complicated as he sighed. Who could have imagined that these peaceful three months in the outside world would be so long and cruel in his eyes? “However, you have benefited a lot.” Yan smilingly said as his eyes paused on Lin Dong. He very clearly felt the vast and mighty Mental Energy that had surged out from the latter’s body earlier. Lin Dong had indeed stepped into the Symbol Grandmaster level. “I have worked hard for so many years. It will be far too embarrassing if I fail to advance.” Lin Dong stretched his waist. After which, he leaped down from the stone platform. Slightly shutting his eyes, he felt the majestic and endless Mental Energy in his Niwan Place and said, “Currently, I can only be considered to be an initial Symbol Grandmaster.” “Once you step into the advance Symbol Grandmaster level, even those experts who have touched the reincarnation power will not be a match for you.” “That won’t be easy.” Lin Dong faintly smiled. After his Mental Energy had reached this level, the amount of effort and hardship needed to advance was tremendous. This time, he had borrowed the power of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers in order to reach the initial Symbol Grandmaster level in three short months. From a certain point of view, it had not been easy to endure through these three months. Lin Dong was uncertain of just how many times he had escaped from the jaws of death during this period of time. “These things are already useless. Shall we get rid of them?” Lin Dong glanced at the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers within the cave. Presently, these demon flowers were all in states of withering. It was clear that their power had been completely exhausted. However, these demon flowers were rather bizarre. Since he no longer had any use for them, it was best to eliminate them. “Aye.” Yan did not have any objections to this. Since Lin Dong had already achieved his aim, these things were useless. Lin Dong chuckled upon seeing this. He did not make any movements, but those Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers in the cave suddenly turned into dust that drifted downwards. “Let’s go, it’s time to leave.” Lin Dong stretched his waist again. He did not give the place another glance and directly walked out of the cave. Behind him, Yan nodded and turned into a flash of light which shot into Lin Dong’s body. Lin Dong’s footsteps paused as he walked out of the Heavenly Cave. He slightly tilted his body and looked towards the deepest part of the Heavenly Cave. When his Mental Energy had broken through to the Symbol Grandmaster level earlier, he had used the Ancestral Symbol eye to see the figure in the deepest part of the Heavenly Cave. He was unable to detect an overly frightening aura from the silver eyed figure, but his sharp senses told him that this person’s strength was likely also at an extremely terrifying level. So terrifying that Lin Dong would not have even the slightest chance of victory if he was to fight against this person in his current state. “I wonder just which old demon it is who has survived since those ancient times…” Lin Dong seemed to mutter to himself. After which, he turned around, following the dark tunnel as he slowly exited the Heavenly Cave. It was a long while later before he walked out of the dark tunnel. Warm sunlight finally began to sprinkle down from the sky. As Lin Dong took a step forward, a quiet mountain range, which was accompanied by a majestic aura, entered into his sights. The peacefulness before his eyes caused Lin Dong to be a little mesmerised. He had never enjoyed such peace during the decade that he had spent in Purgatory… “You have finally come out.” A familiar yet seemingly distant voice was suddenly transmitted into Lin Dong’s ear. After which, he saw a figure appeared beside him as a bewitchingly handsome face appeared before his eyes. “Little… Little Marten…” Lin Dong was slightly startled as he looked at that extremely familiar face. Soon after, his lips parted into a smile. After which, he extended his arms and forcefully hugged the latter. The loneliness within the purgatory had been torture. Hence, he felt deeply emotional upon seeing these familiar faces. “Tsk, tsk, what are you doing…” Little Marten was shocked by this sudden action of Lin Dong. However, his heart was a little moved by the emotions he felt from Lin Dong’s hug. They had met when they were both extremely weak and helpless, and protected each other all the way here. This bond surpassed even that shared by brothers. Lin Dong quickly released his embrace. The smile on his face had also become a lot more natural. Clearly, he was gradually recovering from his memories of Purgatory. “Are you alright?” Little Marten looked at Lin Dong strangely and involuntarily asked. Little Marten finally began to properly observe Lin Dong at this moment. Although it had been only three months since he had last seen the latter and the latter’s appearance had not changed, he was still able to rely on his familiarity with Lin Dong to sense some differences from those pitch-black eyes. The current Lin Dong seemed to have suddenly become a lot older and unfathomable. This feeling was as though Lin Dong had been in seclusion within the Heavenly Cave for thirty years instead of just three months… “It’s nothing.” Lin Dong chuckled and said. He gently patted Little Marten’s shoulder. This appearance caused the latter to feel confused. “Ha ha, young friend Lin Dong, congratulations on advancing to the Symbol Grandmaster level. Even within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, only a handful have managed to attain such Mental Energy accomplishments.” The Heavenly Demon Marten tribe leader also walked forward. His expression contained some surprise as his eyes swept over Lin Dong. Their tribe did possess some elders with astonishing Mental Energy cultivation. However, all of them had accumulated their strength over long periods of time. It was extremely rare to find a young Symbol Grandmaster like Lin Dong. “This junior is merely lucky.” Lin Dong shook his head. If it was not because he had used the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers to build the mysterious Purgatory, it would likely require a couple of years in order to cross this frightening gully even with Yan’s help. “If one can rely on luck to breakthrough to the Symbol Grandmaster level, there will not be so few Symbol Grandmasters in this world.” The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe laughed. “Ha ha, it is likely that young friend Lin Dong is a little tired after returning from your seclusion. I believe that we should first let him rest for one or two days.” First elder Zhu Li laughed from the side. The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe nodded. He spoke a little more to Lin Dong before leading his people away. All of them had been standing guard here while Lin Dong was in seclusion. “I will first bring you to rest. You seemed to be a little out of sorts.” Little Marten said. Lin Dong nodded. He did indeed need some time in order to completely free himself from the memories of Purgatory and return to his usual self. 　　…… Lin Dong remained within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe during the next two days, and finally made a full recovery after these two days of recuperation. The cruel training within the purgatory had already been deeply buried in his mind. However, the vast and mighty Mental Energy Lin Dong had obtained still pervaded his Niwan Palace, letting him understand that the bitter training within Purgatory was not without reward. Lin Dong sat on the edge of a cliff belonging to a lush green mountain. His eyes looked at the sea of trees below as he suddenly stretched. After which, he spoke in his mind, “My Mental Energy had crossed the borders of space the day I exited my retreat and I saw the Devouring Divine Palace…” “Oh?” Yan cried out in a startled voice upon hearing this. Clearly, he did not expect Lin Dong to detect the existence of the Devouring Divine Palace. “The Devouring Divine Palace seems to be hidden in another pocket dimension. It is impossible to detect its actual location. However, I am able to sense an increasingly violent and out of control energy from that pocket dimension. Therefore… it is likely that the pocket dimension where the Devouring Divine Palace is hidden will emerge within a month.” “One month huh? So soon…” “Aye. There will likely be quite a big commotion when that time comes. It is likely that the experts in the entire Demon Region will be able to detect it…” Lin Dong slightly narrowed his eyes. The Devouring Divine Palace’s appearance would definitely stir a huge commotion the moment it appeared. Given the reputation of the Devouring Master during those ancient times, it was likely that all factions will greatly covert it. Moreover, not everyone knew that the Devouring Ancestral Symbol was in Lin Dong’s hands... Therefore, it was likely that even the four overlord tribes would have difficulty remaining calm when the Devouring Divine Palace appeared. Although Lin Dong need not be worried about the Dragon tribe and the Celestial Demon Marten tribe given his relation with them, there were still the other two equally powerful overlord tribes watching from the side. Most importantly… that omnipresent “Devil Prison” would likely also get involved when they learnt of this matter. At that time, it would not be easy for Lin Dong to obtain the inheritance of the Devouring Master in front of all those outstanding experts. “However…” Lin Dong smiled. There was a formidable look rising from the corners of his lips. “I will not yield the inheritance of the Devouring Master to any of you…” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1153","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
