{"id":62208,"no":2452,"title":"Chapter 1139: Hao Jiuyou’s Techniques","content":"Chapter 1139: Hao Jiuyou’s Techniques A black symbol appeared on Hao Jiuyou’s palm. It looked akin to a complex network of tree roots. Countless black light rays spread before they filled Hao Jiuyou’s entire palm. Faintly, extremely dark and vicious ripples began to spread. “I have waited a hundred years for this. How can I let you off so easily today?” Hao Jiuyou inserted his palm into the black hurricane. Both his eyes contained a scarlet color as he stared at the distant Little Marten. Following which, he secretly smirked before he suddenly clenched his hand. Sizzle sizzle! After Hao Jiuyou clenched his hand, it was possible to see many densely packed black light rays shooting out from his palm, which was hidden within the black hurricane. Those black light rays shuttled within the black hurricane and they looked like complicated meridians. Buzz! These black light rays were mixed with the black hurricane, causing its color to deepen. However, it was difficult to detect this change with one’s naked eyes, as these two colors were fairly similar. Only some powerful elders vaguely realized that Hao Jiuyou’s hurricane had suddenly became much stronger. Bang! Many cracks were continuously formed in the empty space where the two hurricanes collided. Loud thunderous noises also spread in waves and resounded across the sky. These two hurricanes contained the vast and mighty Yuan Power from the two of them respectively. Even if they casually swung them around, these hurricanes still possessed a force that could shake the world. Moreover, the two of them were evenly matched and even in an intense fight like this, it was still very difficult to tell who would obtain the upper hand. However, it was clear that this stalemate would not last forever. Swish. The moment those black meridians spread across the black hurricane, the empty space where these two hurricanes collided, also began to collapse at an even faster pace. Meanwhile, the wild and mighty Yuan Power present within the purple-gold hurricane actually began to dissipate a little at a time, after being corroded by that black hurricane. The stalemate was instantly broken at this moment. The black hurricane was just like a brutal black dragon that had left the abyss, as it roared towards the sky and ruthlessly charged towards the purple-gold hurricane with a brutal expression. Bang bang bang! Up against this fearsome attack from the black hurricane, the purple-gold hurricane, which was originally evenly matched with the former, actually began to collapse an inch at a time. After which, just like a triggered chain reaction, the ten thousand feet large vast and powerful Yuan Power purple-gold hurricane exploded, in front of many stunned onlookers. Swoosh! After the purple-gold hurricane collapsed, Hao Jiuyou’s body flashed like a black ray of light. In the next instant, he appeared in front of Little Marten, who was currently in shock due to this unexpected development. After which, he threw his palm forward. There were peculiar black tattoos wrapped around Hao Jiuyou’s palm. Those black tattoos wiggled quietly like poisonous snakes, appearing extremely dark and sinister. “Humph.” Little Marten snorted coldly in his heart after he saw that Hao Jiuyou was still chasing after him. Clenching his fist, purple-black light swiftly gathered in his palm. After which, he gathered all the strength in his body and threw a punch forward. Hao Jiuyou involuntarily split his lips into a smile after he saw that Little Marten was planning on countering his attack head on. Meanwhile, his expression became even more sinister. Bang! A fist and palm clashed, before a huge energy ripple, which could be seen with one’s naked eye, swept across the sky with a loud ‘bang’. In fact, the shockwave completely shattered the clouds in the sky. Standing beneath that terrifying energy assault wave, the expressions of everyone below changed drastically. This was because they saw Little Marten’s body flying backwards by ten thousand feet. After which, he slammed heavily against the wall of a mountain, causing large rocks to tumble. Whoa. A series of shocked exclamations spread below. This fight had actually ended with Hao Jiuyou gaining the upper hand? “How is this possible? Previously, Hao Jiuyou was evenly matched with Ah Diao. Why did he suddenly become so much stronger?” Wu Zhong clenched his hand tightly and cried out furiously when he saw this scene. Some members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe in the vicinity also frowned slightly. Clearly, they did not comprehend the situation. “This…” On the stage, when Zhu Li’s group saw this scene, they were all shocked as well. After all, based on the strength that the both of them had displayed previously, their fight should not have concluded this quickly. “Haha, it seems like Hao Jiuyou still came out on top. But this is only to be expected. Everyone has witnessed his hard work over the past hundred years. Ah Diao might be shockingly talented, but he is still lagging behind by a hundred years.” An elder laughed as he said. “Mm, first elder, this match has already been decided. Shall we…” Another elder, who also supported Hao Jiuyou, nodded and asked. Zhu Li frowned, before he exchanged glances with a couple of elders. After a brief moment of hesitation, he helplessly nodded his head. “Hao Jiuyou wins.” Zhu Li lifted his head, before he looked at the figure in the sky and announced in a deep voice. “Haha, big brother Ah Diao, thank you for the victory.” Hao Jiuyou’s face once again regained its usual warm smile. He looked at the dented mountain wall in the distance, before he cupped his hand together and smilingly said. Bang! The mountain wall exploded before a figure rushed out as rock fragments flew. At this moment, Little Marten’s expression was a little gloomy and there was still some black Qi lingering over his long arms. Moreover, those black Qi were trying to invade his body from all directions. Fortunately, he managed to block them after using his full strength. After all, those energy were extremely overbearing. Little Marten furrowed his brows. Previously, Hao Jiuyou was only able to fight equally with him. However, the former subsequently used some hidden techniques, which allowed his strength to soar abruptly. Moreover, his techniques were a little peculiar. “That power does not belong to you, am I right?” Little Marten’s sharp eyes stared at Hao Jiuyou as he slowly said. “Big brother Ah Diao, what are you saying?” Hao Jiuyou smiled faintly. Then, he completely ignored Little Marten as he turned around and looked at Zhu Li below and said, “First elder, since the match has been decided, may I know if the position of tribe leader successor…” Zhu Li secretly sighed. After which, he nodded and said, “From today onwards, the new tribe leader successor of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe is Hao Jiuyou.” An uproar spread across the square when Zhu Li’s voice sounded. Many members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe had a look of pity as they stared at Little Marten. Who could have imagined that this once incomparably dazzling genius would actually end up defeated. Little Marten ignored the many pairs of eyes. He merely took a deep glance at Hao Jiuyou before landing on the ground. “Ah Diao.” Wu Zhong hurriedly came forward to greet Little Marten after the latter landed on the ground. Then, he gritted his teeth and said, “How is it possible for that fellow to defeat you!” Little Marten waved his hand. Although he also had some doubts in his heart, voicing his doubts now would clearly cause members of his tribe to think that he was a narrow minded individual, who could not accept his loss. Hence, it was pointless for him to say anything for now. Hao Jiuyou stood alone in the sky as he overlooked the many members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe from above. The warm smile on the corner of his lips grew even richer and this was especially the case when he saw Little Marten’s lonely figure. In fact, there was joy rising from within his heart. He was not blessed with extraordinary talents since young. Fortunately, he possessed a sharp mind and a ruthless heart. Hence, he was finally able to trample over this once dazzling genius of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. This alone was sufficient to prove that he was the most outstanding person in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe! From today onwards, no one within the same generation of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would be able to compete with him! In the near future, the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe will also fall under his control! Hao Jiuyou had the impulse to laugh out loud when he thought of this. After enduring for so many years, he had finally tasted success. “Let’s go.” Little Marten said to Wu Zhong. After which, he turned around and left. Wu Zhong could only sigh upon seeing this. He understood Little Marten well and knew just how proud the latter was. As such, he knew that Little Marten must be feeling extremely terrible about the defeat that he suffered today. “Haha, to think that someone from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would actually use the strength of the Yimo. How unexpected…” However, a familiar laughter was suddenly transmitted from the distance, just as Little Marten turned around. Finally, it reverberated across the sky while being wrapped by Yuan Power. “Lin Dong?” Little Marten’s body stiffened when he heard this laughter. He suddenly turned around and looked at the sky with joyous eyes. “Who is it?” Standing in the sky, Hao Jiuyou’s expression suddenly changed before he cried out sternly. Standing below him, the many experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe were also startled. Immediately, they scanned their surroundings in an attempt to locate the person who had just spoken. “Swoosh!” A rushing wind sound appeared from the distance. Soon after, a figure flew out and appeared in the sky in front of many pairs of eyes. The person who had just shown up was exactly Lin Dong, who had entered the Heavenly Cave a few days ago. “Who are you? How dare you barge into our Celestial Demon Marten tribe! Are you courting death?!” Some elders in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe were furious when they saw him. Immediately, vast and mighty Yuan Power surged as they prepared to capture him. “This young friend, may I know what exactly do you mean?” Zhu Li waved his hand and stopped the many elders. His eyes were staring intently at Lin Dong. That was because he clearly heard what the latter said previously. Moreover, as the first elder of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, he was naturally familiar with the word “Yimo”. “You elders of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe are truly a muddle headed bunch. Not only has the Yimo invaded your tribe, but a trap was even placed within your Heavenly Cave and all the experts currently undertaking a seclusion within, have fallen into a hallucination. To think that all of you have failed to detect it even after so many years. You guys have really become a bunch of dotards.” Lin Dong glanced at those elders and involuntarily laughed coldly. “Brat, how dare you utter such nonsense. You are truly courting death!” The two Celestial Demon Marten tribe elders, who had consistently supported Hao Jiuyou, had a drastic change in their expressions. They cried out before they charged forward explosively. Both of them attacked together as they tried to capture Lin Dong. When Lin Dong saw those two elder charging towards him ruthlessly, he curled his lips. However, he showed no intention of putting up a defence. Buzz. However, the space behind Lin Dong suddenly rippled when those two elders were about to reach him. Following which, a dark golden haired majestic figure appeared beside him. The latter extended his hand and clenched it. Immediately, the bodies of the two Celestial Demon Marten tribe elders, who have reached the Samsara stage, froze. “The both of you are so anxious to deliver a killing blow. Is it because you guys have a guilty conscience?” The majestic figure’s eyes contained an endlessly majestic aura as he stared at the two elders in front of him, who now wore terrified expressions. Finally, his deep voice sounded. “Tribe leader?” “Greetings to the tribe leader!” The many Celestial Demon Marten tribe members had a drastic change in their expressions when they saw the figure in the sky. All of them began to kneel a moment later before their respectful voice reverberated across the entire place.
