In the next instant, the liquidized black lightning hand penetrated the demonic aura and slammed heavily against the defence formed by layers of flower petals. Sizzle sizzle! Waves of white smoke erupted from the black flower petals the moment the both of them came into contact. Faintly, it seemed as though there were sharp cries being emitted. The flower petals, which could block the attack from a Samsara stage expert, actually began to melt rapidly. There was indeed quite a huge gap between Lin Dong’s strength and that of a Samsara stage expert. Fortunately, he possessed two great Ancestral Symbols and they were exceptionally powerful against the strength of the Yimo. Hence, even Hao Jiuyou was shocked when he saw his defences collapsing so rapidly. “You!” Hao Jiuyou’s furious and alarmed voice sounded from behind his heavily fortified defences. Soon after, the black flower began to shake violently. After which, countless black vines penetrated the air and ruthlessly shot towards Lin Dong in an attempt to stop him. A glint flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes when he detected those attacks, that were whistling over from all directions. However, he displayed no intention of dodging. Instead, a jade colour glow began to flicker over the surface of his body. Puff puff puff! Those sharp black vines shot violently towards Lin Dong’s body. Though most of them were deflected, there were still some vines which managed to break through Lin Dong’s defences and penetrate his body. Intense pain spread all over Lin Dong’s body. Meanwhile, a scarlet tinge also surged within his black eyes. Nonetheless, even though various parts of his body were penetrated by those black vines, they did not manage to hit the fatal points on his body. Of course, if Lin Dong allowed Hao Jiuyou to continue attacking, it was likely that he would not be able to endure despite his formidable physical body. “Let’s see which one of us can endure until the end!” A ruthless glint flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes, before black lightning glow suddenly surged. The two faintly visible ancient symbols present on his liquidized palm, also unleashed a dazzling glow. “Die!” A low and deep roar, which was packed with killing intent, was emitted from Lin Dong’s throat. He clenched his hand before all the strength within his body gushed through his fist. Bang! A black lightning glow suddenly shot out from Lin Dong’s liquidized fist. It heavily smashed against the black flower petals before they disintegrated almost instantly. “Ahh!” Hao Jiuyou’s miserable cry was emitted from deep within the flower, after he was hit by that black lightning glow, which was filled with ancient symbols. Sizzle sizzle. Right now, there were numerous cracks on that huge black flower. Those vines dancing in the sky also began to wither rapidly. Within ten breaths’ time, that black flower, which was filled with an evil aura, simply vanished in front of many bewildered onlookers. With dust dancing in the sky, the heavy flower petals defence in front of Lin Dong also turned into dust and scattered off. Hao Jiuyou’s body once again appeared. However, he currently wore a pale and shocked expression. Moreover, there was a bloody hole on his chest, while blood continuously flowed out from within. Clearly, it was caused by Lin Dong’s final attack. “You?!” Hao Jiuyou’s expression was venomous as he stared at Lin Dong, whose body was riddled with bloody holes. Meanwhile, his eyes still contained a look of disbelief. After all, never did he imagine that Lin Dong was actually able to break his final defence. “It seems like the person who is going to have the last laugh, is not going to be you.” Lin Dong coughed violently before he casually wiped off the blood on the corner of his lips. His black eyes were calm as he looked at Hao Jiuyou. Meanwhile, his expression caused the latter’s body to turn cold. “You lunatic.” Hao Jiuyou gritted his teeth and said. Lin Dong had basically staked his life in this fight. If any slight mishap occurred, it was likely that the result of this fight would be completely different. “I’m used to hearing that.” Lin Dong smiled. Most of the opponents that he encountered, were typically far stronger than he was. Hence, if he did not ruthlessly go all-out, it was likely that he would not have reached where he was today. “I’ll kill you!” The corner of Hao Jiuyou’s mouth twitched. His face was distorted while his eyes were filled with a brutal murderous intent. Although he had suffered serious injuries, he was still an ultimate Samsara stage expert. Even though Lin Dong was able to rely on various techniques to fight equally with him, it was difficult for the former to kill him. This was despite the fact that Lin Dong had two great Ancestral Symbols. “Swoosh swoosh swoosh!” However, the black light pillars, which were shooting out from the sixty-nine mountaintops, disappeared simultaneously just as the furious Hao Jiuyou was about to kill the exhausted Lin Dong. After the black light pillars disappeared, the black hallucination fragrance, which enveloped the entire place, began to dissipate at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was a sign that the formation was broken. …… When Lin Dong saw that the hallucination fragrance was vanishing, he solemnly heaved a sigh of relief. They had finally managed to break this darned formation… “You bastards!” Hao Jiuyou’s expression involuntarily turned much paler after he saw that his formation was broken. He let out a roar before he leapt towards Lin Dong and directed a formidable wind slash towards his throat. Swoosh! However, a hurried rushing wind sound suddenly appeared just as Hao Jiuyou was about to strike Lin Dong’s body. Immediately, a phantom like figure showed up in front of Lin Dong, before he threw a palm forward and clashed with Hao Jiuyou. Bang! A wild and violent wind swept forth, before Hao Jiuyou flew backwards in a miserable fashion. Since his body was already riddled with injuries, he immediately vomited a mouthful of blood. Lifting his head, he proceeded to stare venomously at that tall figure, who had appeared in front of Lin Dong. “Are you alright?” Little Marten stood in front of Lin Dong. His eyes drifted towards the terribly injured Lin Dong, before the corner of his eyes twitched as he asked. “I’m fine, I’ll make it.” Lin Dong shook his head. Fortunately, he possessed the Primal Dragon Bone. Otherwise, he would not dare to act so recklessly. That was because he might truly be unable to endure even before he could kill his enemy. Little Marten secretly sighed in relief when he saw that Lin Dong was still conscious despite suffering serious injuries. After which, his expression turned cold as he stared at Hao Jiuyou, whose expression was currently in flux, and asked, “What more do you have to say now?” “Humph, consider yourselves lucky. However, I’ll not be taking this lying down!” Hao Jiuyou gave a cold chuckle. After which, monstrous demonic aura swept out from within his body as he attempted to escape. “You actually believe that you can escape?” Little Marten chuckled and shook his head upon seeing this. Waving his hand, more than a hundred light pillars instantly came whistling over. These light pillars entwined around each other to form a light net that completely covered Hao Jiuyou. Bang bang! Hao Jiuyou struggled wildly within that huge net. However, it was to no avail. Those tribe elites, who had previously went to remove the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers, were all freed from their task. Therefore, there were more than a hundred experts attacking in unison. With Hao Jiuyou’s current condition, as well as the fact that he had lost support from his formation, how is it possible for him to escape? “Lock him up. We will deal with him later.” Little Marten glanced at the raging Hao Jiuyou before he said. “Understood!” Those powerful individuals cupped their hands and accepted his order. Then, they directly dragged Hao Jiuyou onto the ground and began to seal the latter’s Yuan Power. When he finished instructing them, Little Marten finally turned around. As he looked at Lin Dong, a strange expression surfaced on his handsome face, “After only a few months’ time, I never expected you to become so powerful.” Little Marten was well aware of Hao Jiuyou’s strength and even he would have difficulties pushing the latter until such an extent. Yet, Lin Dong managed to seriously injure Hao Jiuyou with just the strength of advance Profound Death stage. This was truly an astounding fact. “You can hardly match up to me when it comes to dealing with the Yimo.” Lin Dong laughed. The proud Little Marten nodded and he did not raise any objections. He was indeed no match for the current Lin Dong when it came to dealing with the Yimo. “Thank you very much this time around.” Little Marten’s eyes shifted away from Lin Dong’s body. He hesitated for a moment before he said. “Such words… are unnecessary” Lin Dong smiled as he shook his head. Little Marten was speechless. After which, he laughed involuntarily. There was indeed no need for such courteous words between the both of them. An ordinary person might have difficulties understanding their relationship, but they were well aware of how a weak and tender youth, together with a frail demonic spirit, which could vanish at any moment, had carefully survived and protected each other along the way, as they slowly became stronger… They were brothers. “We should activate the tribe guarding formation.” Little Marten looked at the two fights in the sky and said. The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe and first elder Zhu Li were unable to defeat the two Yimo kings. However, with help from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe’s tribe guarding formation, those two Yimo kings would naturally be no match for them. “There is no need to. Those two Yimo kings have already realized what is going on and they will not continue to fight.” Lin Dong shook his head. The energy storm, which continuously erupted in the sky, also gradually weakened after he spoke. Soon after, two black figures shot backwards before they gathered together. “That useless person.” When the Heaven Illusion King duo saw the broken formation, as well as the experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe who were all ready to strike, their expressions involuntarily became ugly. Not only had they brought forward their plans this time around, they had also wasted a large number of Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. This was quite a severe loss. “It looks like your plan is going to fail.” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader looked at the two Yimo kings before he smiled faintly and said. “Haha, it is too early for you to be celebrating. If not because of that trash this time around, I’m afraid that your Celestial Demon Marten tribe would not have escaped easily… Oh well, it doesn’t matter. We will let your Celestial Demon Marten tribe live for awhile longer.” The Heaven Illusion King looked at the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, before a strange smile slowly lifted on the corner of his lips. “However, it’s too early for you guys to be celebrating. We will return, and at that time, I’m afraid that no one will be able to rescue all of you…” “Haha, in the next great world war, my Yimo tribe will show no mercy! Everything in this world shall be ruled by us, the Yimo tribe!” A black swirl formed behind the Heaven Illusion King duo. After which, their bodies also began to disappear within it a little at a time. Only their dense laughter continued to echo across this place, causing everyone’s heart to sink. Lin Dong looked at the spot where the two Yimo kings had disappeared, before he clenched his hand involuntarily. The Devil Prison’s techniques were truly incredible. In fact, it was impossible to tell just how many factions, beside the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, were invaded by them over all these years. Would the world have any chance of emerging victorious if another world war occurs?
