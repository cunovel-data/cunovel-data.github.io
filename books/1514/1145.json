Due to this, the entire sky became foggy and hazy, causing one to feel somewhat dazed.\n This was an omen that the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers were about to complete the illusion. Once the illusion was completed, the weaker Celestial Demon Marten tribe members will all be trapped within. Furthermore, even if they awakened, it would still leave them with severe injuries. After all, there was a huge gap between them and the top tier practitioners in the Heavenly Cave. \n “Let’s attack now. We cannot afford to wait anymore.” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe looked at this scene and knew that they could not afford to wait around anymore. \n “Understood!”\n Zhu Li nodded solemnly. He waved his sleeves before ten figures rushed over from below. They were all ultimate experts who have stepped into the Samsara stage and they were considered as the elite of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe.\n “Everyone else, protect the weaker tribe members!” Zhu Li looked below and cried out in a deep voice. Currently, some of the weaker tribe members have already fallen into a hallucination. Therefore, there was a need for powerful individuals to protect them. \n “Young friend Lin Dong, you can pick any of the remaining individuals. All you need to do is to leave some behind in order to protect the rest of the tribe.”\n “Alright.”\n Lin Dong nodded. Without further ado, his body moved as he swiftly pulled back. \n “In the ancient times, despite the rampant behavior of your Yimo tribe, your tribe was still unable to exterminate our Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Now, you actually believe that you can exterminate my Celestial Demon Marten tribe with just two Yimo kings alone? What a joke!” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader took a step forward before terrifying Yuan Power gathered behind him. A Reincarnation ripple spread and everything became quiet under this ripple.\n “Haha, whether we succeed or not, we’ll find out after we try.”\n The Heaven Illusion King laughed. He clenched his hand before monstrous demonic aura spread. Many mysterious black symbols appeared over his pale face, causing him to appear even more sinister.\n “Bang!”\n The both of them faced each other before sparks flashed. In the next instant, two terrifying light figures shot out simultaneously before they collided heavily against each other. After which, both light figures rose into the sky amidst the spreading assault waves.\n “Attack!”\n Zhu Li waved his hand upon seeing this. Immediately, the ten Samsara stage experts behind him roared in unison. Following which, eleven figures shot directly towards the Earth Illusion King.\n “Hao Jiuyou, take control of the formation and eliminate everyone else.” The Earth Illusion King glanced at Hao Jiuyou, who was standing behind him, before he stated indifferently.\n “Understood!”\n A brutal expression surfaced in Hao Jiuyou’s eyes when he heard this. After which, he stared menacingly at everyone present.\n After giving his instructions, the Earth Illusion King rushed forward and charged towards Zhu Li’s group in an overbearing fashion. Monstrous demonic aura swept forth before he forcefully stopped Zhu Li’s group.\n When Lin Dong saw the earthshaking battle, which had instantly erupted in the sky, he involuntarily sighed. The lineup for this fight was not inferior to the one he saw back at the Flame Divine Hall.\n “Little Marten.”\n Lin Dong rushed downwards and appeared beside Little Marten. As of now, there were already many experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe gathering around him. Although they were weaker than the elders, they were considered as the elite. An example was Wu Zhong, who had entered the Samsara stage. However, there was still a gap between him and the elders.\n “What should we do now?” When Little Marten saw this chaotic scene, he was at a loss. After all, they were all extremely wary of those Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers.\n “We must break that formation as soon as possible. Otherwise, more and more people will fall into a hallucination as the hallucination fragrance accumulates.” Lin Dong glanced at the swaying black flowers on the distant mountaintops, before he said in a deep voice.\n “How do we break it?” Little Marten asked.\n “We must remove all sixty-nine Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers simultaneously in order to break the formation.”\n “However, we are unable to get close to those Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers…” Wu Zhong frowned and said. He was quite powerful and he could still endure for a while. However, it might be difficult for others to do so. \n “All of you should divide yourselves in sixty-nine groups, with three men in each group.” After contemplating for a moment, Lin Dong instructed them.\n Little Marten did not hesitate after hearing this. He waved his hand before the large number of experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, that were gathered beside him, immediately split in a well coordinated fashion. Soon after, they formed sixty-nine small groups. This lineup was quite formidable and it caused Lin Dong to secretly praise them in his heart. It’s no wonder they were one of the four overlord tribes. Such a foundation was truly deserving of respect. \n “I will give each group a Demon Destroyer Talisman. This will allow you to temporarily suppress the Eternal Illusion Demon Flower’s hallucination fragrance. All of you must cooperate with each other in this extremely short period of time and remove all sixty-nine Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers in order to break the formation.” Lin Dong clenched his hand before the Ancestor Stone appeared in his palm. Subsequently, sixty-nine warm white lights shot out and were given to the sixty-nine small groups.\n “Moreover, the Ancestor Stone is only able to produce this amount of Demon Destroyer Talismans. Hence, we only have one opportunity. If we fail, we will require a much longer time in order to break the formation. At that time, I’m afraid that things will become even more troublesome.” Lin Dong warned with a solemn expression.\n “Understood!”\n The many experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe nodded solemnly upon hearing this.\n “What about you?” As if he recalled something, Little Marten suddenly turned towards Lin Dong and asked. After which, Wu Zhong and the rest also looked at Lin Dong with a doubtful expression.\n “There is no way that fellow will allow us to break the formation so easily. Hence, I shall deal with him.” Lin Dong shrugged his shoulders. After which, he lifted his head and looked at a spot in the sky. At that spot, Hao Jiuyou was staring at them with sinister eyes. Meanwhile, dense black hallucination fragrance circulated around him. It seems like the latter was able to activate the strength of the formation.\n “Are you going to fight with him all by yourself?” Little Marten’s expression changed. Previously, he had exchanged blows with Hao Jiuyou and he knew how troublesome it was to deal with that fellow. Moreover, he had currently became much stronger, since he was able to utilize the strength of his formation.\n “Why don’t I lend you a hand?”\n Lin Dong shook his head. “The hallucination fragrance around him is extremely dense. Without the protection from the Ancestor Stone, you are unable to last for long. Relax, I might have a headache dealing with him if he is merely an ordinary Celestial Demon Marten tribe Samsara stage expert. However, it will be a lot less troublesome since he possess the strength of the Yimo.”\n Most of Lin Dong’s techniques were extremely powerful against Yimo. Hence, even though others might find them extremely troublesome to deal with, it was evidently much easier for him to deal with a Yimo compared to an ordinary expert.\n “Alright, let us know if you cannot hold on any longer and I will lead some men and assist you.” Little Marten frowned. However, there was little he could do right now. Hence, he simply nodded and said.\n “I will.”\n Lin Dong gave a faint smile. He said, “All of you should hurry. Let’s get moving. Moreover, don’t destroy the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. Pluck them and hand them over to me. I have plans for them.”\n Little Marten nodded. Then, he waved his hand and cried, “Move!”\n Hundreds of figures immediately rushed forward in all directions after his voice sounded. Their momentum was quite startling.\n After Little Marten’s group swiftly departed, Lin Dong locked his eyes onto Hao Jiuyou, who was standing in the sky. His body moved before he leapt towards the sky. Finally, he appeared in front of the latter. \n “A mere advance Profound Death stage brat actually dares to challenge me all by himself? Truly an arrogant bastard.” Hao Jiuyou looked at Lin Dong, who had come on his own, before a ridicule rose on his lips as he chuckled.\n “It’s enough to deal with you.”\n Lin Dong laughed before a warm white light filled the space around him. Those hallucination fragrance, which were diffusing over, would disappear with a sizzling sound upon making contact and they could not harm Lin Dong at all.\n “Such shameless words. Do you really think that there is nothing I can do to you since you are protected by the Ancestor Stone? Moreover, since you ruined my plans, I will definitely make you suffer a fate worse than death after I capture you!” Hao Jiuyou gave a menacing chuckle. Soon after, his hand seals changed before the surrounding black flower fragrance quickly spread. After which, he swung his sleeves before the space shook, and over a dozen huge black vines, which resembled poisonous snakes, penetrated through the empty space and shot explosively towards Lin Dong with lightning like speed.\n “Bang!”\n Lin Dong clenched his hand upon seeing this. Lightning erupted before his Lightning Emperor Scepter appeared. Following which, thunderbolts shot out and tore past over a dozen huge black vines.\n Sizzle sizzle!\n Those black vines, which could easily ensnare a perfect Profound Death stage expert, were split apart after those thunderbolts flashed by. The places whereby they were split were as smooth as the surface of a mirror.\n “This power...”\n Hao Jiuyou’s pupils shrunk when he saw this. That was because he could detect a frightening power from the Lightning Emperor Scepter in Lin Dong’s hands.\n “Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol!”\n “You are quite sharp.” Lin Dong laughed.\n “I was wondering why you dared to come alone. It turns out you actually have something like this to rely on. However, even though the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol is powerful, with your feeble strength, a treasure like that has merely gone to waste.”\n “Any external object is useless in the face of absolute strength!”\n Hao Jiuyou laughed. His body shook before his ten thousand feet large black bat wings extended from his back. Immediately, the surrounding Yuan Power began to churn violently.\n At this moment, the black hallucination fragrance began to gather swiftly on Hao Jiuyou’s broken arm, turning it into a mysterious black arm with Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers tattooed on it.\n “You are not qualified to play with me, brat!”\n Flapping his bat wings, Hao Jiuyou suddenly clenched his black arm tightly. When he felt the vast and mighty ocean like energy surging within his body, the smile on the corner of his lips grew even more brutal. \n “It is too early to say who is no match for whom!”\n Lin Dong stomped his foot heavily against the ground. Immediately, a clear and ancient dragon roar was emitted from within his body. After which, jade colored light gathered behind him. Then, with a ‘puff’ sound, they broke free from his body and transformed into a pair of ten thousand feet long jade colored dragon wings.\n Roar roar!\n A few hundred dragon light tattoos roared and circled around Lin Dong’s body. After which, an intense pressure swept forth like floodwaters, involuntarily attracting the attention of the crowd. Moreover, after they saw the ten thousand feet large jade wings behind Lin Dong, shock promptly surfaced in their eyes. \n “That ripple…”\n The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who was engaging in an intense fight with the Heaven Illusion King, turned his attention at this moment. His peripheral vision drifted towards the skinny figure standing in the sky, while a tinge of shock flashed across his heart.\n “It is actually… the Primal Dragon Bone?!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1143","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
