{"id":61014,"no":1258,"title":"Chapter 1256: Return to the Sect","content":"“Have you resolved the matter?” In a room within the Lin Clan, Lin Xiao looked at Lin Dong, who had returned, as he smiled and asked.\\n\\n Lin Dong nodded. After which, he roughly explained the matters that had occurred within the Great Wastelands Tablet.\\n\\n Lin Xiao’s expression changed when he heard that there was actually such a powerful Yimo within the Great Wastelands Tablet. He sighed quietly and nodded. If it was not for Lin Dong, there would likely be another great calamity.\\n\\n “Father, I have been away for quite some time. I will perhaps return to Dao Sect tomorrow.” Lin Dong handed a jade token to Lin Xiao and said. “Shatter this jade token if any problems occurs. I will hurry back immediately.”\\n\\n It was time for him to return to the sect after being away for such a long time. Moreover, he could also sense that Zhou Tong’s Yuan Spirit in the Ancestral Stone was beginning to recover. It was likely that he would really like to see Dao Sect when he awakened.\\n\\n Lin Xiao received the jade token and nodded. After which, he smilingly said, “That’s right, you should go and see Mmiss Qingzhu. You brought her to our house, only to disappear for ten days. This is too rude.”\\n\\n Lin Dong shook his head helplessly after seeing the gloating smile on Lin Xiao. I had originally thought that the matter would be very quickly resolved. It was unexpected for him to have been delayed for so long.\\n\\n Lin Dong headed for the courtyard after leaving the room where he saw Ling Qingzhu chatting with Liu Yan. The former merely glanced at Lin Dong when he appeared before withdrawing her eyes.\\n\\n “Ha ha, Dong’er is back.” Liu Yan smiled towards Lin Dong. After which, she stepped forward and patted Lin Dong’s shoulders. After throwing a meaningful look towards Ling Qingzhu, she smilingly left.\\n\\n Lin Dong smiled bitterly and walked towards Qingzhu.\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu waved her sleeve gently. Her pretty eyes slightly lowered as she said in a faint voice, “I will be returning to Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace tomorrow.”\\n\\n Although her tone appeared uncaring, Lin Dong could still hear an extremely faint trace of anger within. She had panicked slightly when she was being brought back by him in such a manner. Yet, Lin Dong had disappeared during this period of time. This undoubtedly caused her to feel awkward and angry. However, she had extremely good manners, and interacted with Liu Yan and Lin Dong’s other elders with a smile. Nevertheless, it was inevitable that she would feel angry at Lin Dong for disappearing without telling her.\\n\\n He had brought her home, only to disappear. What was the meaning of this?\\n\\n Lin Dong hurriedly pulled her sleeve as he smiled bitterly and said, “It is indeed my fault this time. Originally, I believed that I would be able to swiftly resolve the problem. I did not expect to be delayed for so long.”\\n\\n Lin Dong observed Ling Qingzhu’s pretty face as he spoke. “I met the Ninth Seat King of Devil Prison.”\\n\\n “Ninth Seat King?”\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu’s expression changed. Having exchanged blows with the Seventh Seat King, she naturally understood that just how terrifying those Yimo from Devil Prison with the title of seated kings were. They had failed to gain an advantage against the Seventh Seat King despite their cooperation. Yet, Lin Dong had encountered the Ninth Seat King alone?\\n\\n “Are you alright?”\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu raised her eyebrow. A trace of concern was present in her clear eyes as she looked towards Lin Dong.\\n\\n “I’m fine. That fellow’s strength was greatly reduced because he was sealed. However, I still had to battle him for a couple of days…” Lin Dong’s eyes spun with thought. He glanced at Ling Qingzhu and eloquently exaggerated the dangers when fighting the Ninth Seat King. It was as though he had only obtained a narrow victory after barely evading the jaws of death.\\n\\n However, this attempt of his did not appear to be of much use against Ling Qingzhu. Her pretty face remained as unmoving as still water. There was no reaction no matter how Lin Dong exaggerated.\\n\\n Lin Dong could only helplessly stop after seeing that she was indifferent. It was indeed difficult to deal with an intelligent woman.\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu finally glanced at Lin Dong as he grow softer and softer. Her red lips curled slightly after seeing the latter’s resentful facem and her eyes became a little gentler. Although Lin Dong had exaggerated, a big battle was definitely unavoidable after meeting the Ninth Seat King.\\n\\n “I will not be coming again if you dare to do this next time.”\\n\\n The originally resentful Lin Dong was startled when he heard the voice that had suddenly emerged from beside him. He laughed dryly and nodded. “Rest assured that I will also bring you along the next time.”\\n\\n Lin Dong sighed in relief. He had finally passed this trial.\\n\\n “Are you returning tomorrow?” Lin Dong changed the topic and asked.\\n\\n “Yes.” Ling Qingzhu lightly nodded and said. “After all, I have been away for such a long time. Although the palace has many elders to maintain it, I cannot continue like this as the palace master.”\\n\\n “Coincidentally, I am also planning on returning to Dao Sect tomorrow. In that case, I will send you back to Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.” Lin Dong nodded and said.\\n\\n “I will go into cultivation seclusion and attempt to comprehend Reincarnation when I return to the palace. It is likely that I will not come out for some time.”\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu looked at Lin Dong and said, “You should spend more time trying to understand the Zenith Sensing Art. The way you sense it does not come from within. Currently, you are only at the entry level. This is far from sufficient if you wish to reach the level of those ancient masters.”\\n\\n Lin Dong was stunned. His expression was complicated as he looked at Ling Qingzhu. She was indeed aware of his intentions with regards to learning the Zenith Sensing Art.\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu avoided his gaze. After which, she headed out of the courtyard, “You have been busy. Please rest.”\\n\\n However, a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist as she was turning around. The warmth transmitted from it caused her alluring figure to tremble. She anxiously tried to escape, but the great strength from the hand prevented her from doing so. Slight panic was revealed on her usually aloof and pretty face revealed, “You… what are you planning to… ah?”\\n\\n A force was suddenly transmitted from her hand. Subsequently, she lightly crashed into a firm chest. Next, her narrow and soft waist was firmly embraced by a pair of hands.\\n\\n “Thank you.”\\n\\n A soft apologetic voice sounded beside her ear before she could struggle. Ling Qingzhu’s figure stopped moving as she stood there with a red face. She did not know what she ought to do. If this was someone else, it was likely that she would have drawn her sword and slashed him into two. However, she was unable to harden her heart against this fellow. All she could do was gently bite her lower lips and allowed him to take advantage of her.\\n\\n However, Lin Dong did not bring things any further. He merely hugged the person in his embrace in an attempt to relief some of the apologetic feelings in his heart.\\n\\n The courtyard was quiet. It was a long time later before a lovely figure finally appeared at the gate to the courtyard. She saw the two figures hugging, and curled her small lips as she released an intentional soft snort.\\n\\n She might have been soft, but it immediately broke the atmosphere in the courtyard, and Ling Qingzhu abruptly recovered. She stared at Lin Dong in an embarrassed and angry manner. His actions had caused the latter’s heart to pound harder.\\n\\n Before he could speak however, Ling Qingzhu had already fled in panic. Such an appearanceappearence was completely different from her usual aloof and indifferent self.\\n\\n Lin Dong laughed dryly. He looked at Qingtan, who was covering her small mouth, and smiled in an embarrassed manner.\\n\\n Qingtan walked to Lin Dong’s side. Her pretty eyes looked at the direction Ling Qingzhu had fled as she said, “Big brother Lin Dong, I recall that you still have a Ying Huanhuan from Dao Sect, right? If you do this…”\\n\\n Lin Dong felt his head swell upon hearing this. This girl was clearly looking for trouble. He immediately extended his hand and violently rubbed Qingtan’s small head. “A child should not utter such nonsense when it comes to the matters between adults.\\n\\n “I am the master of Darkness Palace, not some little child!” Qingtan said unhappily.\\n\\n Lin Dong extended his finger and chuckled as he flicked Qingtan’s smooth forehead.\\n\\n “Big brother Lin Dong, are you returning to Dao Sect tomorrow?” Qingtan suddenly hugged Lin Dong’s arm and happily asked.\\n\\n Lin Dong nodded. From her appearance, it was likely that she had heard it from Lin Xiao.\\n\\n “I want to go too!’\\n\\n “No. Stay at home and keep father and mother company!”\\n\\n “Father and mother have agreed!”\\n\\n “No!”\\n\\n “In that case, I will send a Yuan spirit message to Ying Huanhuan and tell her what you did earlier!”\\n\\n “... are you asking for a beating?”\\n\\n 　　……\\n\\n The next day, Lin Dong looked at the lovely Qingtan, who smilingly followed behind him. All he could do was to shake his head in a displeased manner. He had finally experienced this girl’s amazing pestering ability.\\n\\n Ling Qingzhu stood gracefully beside him. She was currently smiling and chatting with Liu Yan, who had come to sent them off.\\n\\n “Father, mother, we are leaving.” Lin Dong saw that it was almost time. He smiled and spoke towards Lin Xiao and Liu Yan.\\n\\n “Okay. Be careful.”\\n\\n The Lin Xiao couple nodded. Lin Dong was no longer the youth from back then. They were aware of the achievements of their son, and this made them extremely proud.\\n\\n Lin Dong also grinned and replied. After which, he did not delay any longer. With a wave of his sleeve, the three of them had already turned into a ray of light and shot into the distance. They disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n Lin Dong sent Ling Qingzhu back to Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace after leaving the Great Yan Empire. After a period of reconstruction, Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace was once again complete. The Lin Dong duo stayed for a while, before bidding her goodbye and headed straight for Dao Sect.\\n\\n Within half a day, the mountain range of Dao Sect once again appeared in their sights. Lin Dong’s eyes scanned the area and paused for a moment. A lovely figure was seated on the cliff atop a mountain. Her long icy-blue hair scattered downwards, and she gave off a chilling aura, causing the surrounding land to be covered in frost.\\n\\n “Huanhuan?”\\n\\n Lin Dong was startled when he saw the familiar figure, and hurriedly flew over with Qingtan. Meanwhile, the figure had also detected his return, and ripples appeared in her pretty but icy eyes.\\n\\n “You are back?” Ying Huanhuan stood up. A slight smile surfaced on her pretty face.\\n\\n “Why are you here?” Lin Dong smiled and asked.\\n\\n “I was waiting for you.” Ying Huanhuan’s delicate hand lifted a strand of long icy-blue hair and laughed softly. She said it as if it was the most normal thing in the world.\\n\\n Lin Dong was stunned. He gazed at Ying Huanhuan’s pretty face. Those icy-blue eyes appeared like blue gemstones. Though they were completely icy, there was some gentleness within this air freezing iciness.\\n\\n Compared to the past, she seemed to have become a little quieter. Lin Dong vaguely felt that something was amiss. However, he was unable to explain it.\\n\\n “You are still running around in this condition?”\\n\\n Lin Dong sighed softly. He extended his hand towards her and said, “Let’s head back.”\\n\\n Ying Huanhuan nodded. She smiled and a cold slender hand held Lin Dong’s hand. The iciness within her heart seemed to ripple as she felt the warmth in her palm, while the smile on her lips became even gentler.\\n\\n “You are Huanhuan?”\\n\\n Qingtan, who was following beside Lin Dong, looked at Ying Huanhuan, who had changed greatly from back then. She was a little stunned as she asked, “Why have you become like this?”\\n\\n “Don’t ask unnecessary questions.”\\n\\n Lin Dong patted Qingtan’s small head. After she, he pulled her along and directly headed towards Dao Sect. His eyes turned towards a mountain behind them just as he was about to enter Dao Sect and nodded in gratitude.\\n\\n The Flame Master stood there and watched the three of them enter Dao Sect. After which, he softly sighed with a complicated expression.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1256","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
