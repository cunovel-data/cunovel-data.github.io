{"id":62205,"no":2449,"title":"Chapter 1136: Awakening","content":"Chapter 1136: Awakening\n “Symbol Grandmaster?”\n Lin Dong’s body clearly stiffened for a moment when these two words entered his ears. Following which, there was intense heat surging from deep within his jet black eyes. \n Symbol Grandmaster.\n This was a watershed level for the Symbol Masters. There were many people in this world who trained their Mental Energy. Similarly, there were many people who trained both their Mental Energy and Yuan Power simultaneously. However, there were very few practitioners whose Mental Energy cultivation could reach the Symbol Grandmaster level.\n Mental Energy was undoubtedly even more ethereal compared to Yuan Power. Therefore, trying to reach the level of Symbol Grandmaster was evidently no easy task.\n Before reaching the Symbol Grandmaster level, the strength of one’s Mental Energy might be a little weaker compared to the powerful and majestic Yuan Power. However, upon stepping into this level, the true might of Mental Energy would be slowly revealed.\n A Symbol Grandmaster was comparable to a Samsara stage expert. In fact, even a Samsara stage expert would have a great headache when dealing with a top expert, whose Mental Energy had reached the Symbol Grandmaster level.\n Currently, Lin Dong’s Mental Energy cultivation was at the advance Divine Symbol Master level and he was only one step away from the Symbol Grandmaster level. However, he was well aware that he would need a huge chance encounter in order to take this step.\n However, was this “Eternal Illusion Demon Flower” the chance encounter that he was waiting for? \n “The Eternal Illusion Demon Flower is able to cause one to fall into a hallucination. The thing that is trapped in the hallucination is not one’s physical body, but one’s Mental Energy body. Therefore, from a certain point of view, this is an unique training method for one’s Mental Energy. Of course, the precondition is that one must be able to control this power. Otherwise, not only would one fail to make progress, but one might end up harming one’s Mental Energy body and cause one to wither to death.” Yan said in a faint voice.\n Lin Dong nodded. It seems like this item was both a threat and an opportunity at the same time.\n “Of course, we do not have the time now. Let’s resolve the issues here first.”\n Yan’s voice had just sounded when a warm white light shot out from within Lin Dong’s body. The light gathered and transformed into a white light dagger. The dagger flashed and left three blade glows. It was possible to see three huge pits being cut on the mountain wall. The rocks fell and one could see some dark roots extending from within the soil. The roots were entangled around each other and it appearing exceptionally terrifying, like the face of a ghost.\n “Hiss hiss!”\n That Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers seemed to have detected some danger after they were removed from the soil, as they actually emitted sharp cries. The flowers danced before dense black light, which was accompanied by a hallucination fragrance, swiftly swept towards Lin Dong.\n Lin Dong was startled upon seeing this. He did not expect these plants to be so fearsome even after they were weeded out.\n “Humph.”\n Yan’s cold snort sounded at this moment. A white light shot out from within Lin Dong’s body and turned into an ancient stone talisman. Symbols shot out from the stone talisman like chains and embedded themselves into the rocks that had fallen into the soil.\n Bang!\n The rocks burst apart before three complicated black rhizomes emerged under the entwinement of the many symbol chains. They struggled intensely as waves of evil black Qi came seeping out. However, these black Qi completely disappeared upon making contact with the symbol chains, just like snow meeting lava.\n “Collect!”\n A low cry was emitted from within the stone symbol. The symbol chains retreated while they were directly wrapped around the three Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. After which, they went back into the stone symbol. After they disappeared, most of the strange fragrance within the mountain cave also instantly dissipated.\n Lin Dong sighed in relief after he saw that the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers were subjugated by Yan. Thankfully, he possessed the Ancestor Stone, a divine object that is extremely proficient at dealing with the Yimo. Otherwise, it was likely that he would not dare to enter this mountain cave.\n “It is time to remove the hallucination fragrance within his body now.” Lin Dong’s eyes turned towards the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who was seated on a stone platform. His expression was grave. If they were unable to remove the hallucination fragrance within the latter’s body, there was no telling just how long they would have to wait for him to awaken on his accord.\n “Relax.”\n Yan replied. A light rose and appeared above the head of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. After which, a humming sound was emitted. Warm light scattered downwards and enveloped him.\n Sizzle sizzle!\n With the many rays of light enveloping around him, the rock like body of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader began to tremble slightly. After which, there were traces of extremely faint black Qi being emitted from his pores. Those black Qi contained a strange fragrance.\n That black Qi emitted an ear-piercing sound when it made contact with the white light covering the body of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. Soon after, they began to dissipate.\n Standing by the side, Lin Dong stood quietly without making a sound. All he did, was stare at the face of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. The latter currently had extremely interesting expressions. The majority of them were lost and confused expressions. Clearly, with the removal of the traces of hallucination fragrance within his body, the hallucination that he was in was no longer a perfect one. After all, if even the slightest flaw was to appear in the hallucination, attempting to trap a peak level expert like him would no longer be a simple task.\n This cleansing continued on for half a day. Only then, did Lin Dong see that the light that was emitted from the Ancestor Stone, was being retracted a bit at a time.\n The body of the Ancestor Stone shook after the final ray of light returned back to it. It subsequently turned into a ray of light and tunneled back into Lin Dong’s body.\n Upon seeing this, Lin Dong understood that the cleansing had been completed. He joyously looked at the seated Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. However, he was stunned when he realized that the latter still showed no signs of awakening.\n “Although the hallucination fragrance in his body has been completely removed, he has been trapped in the hallucination for such a long period of time. Hence, he must be completely conscious before he can awaken. Otherwise, he will be confused between reality and hallucination, which would end up hurting his mind.” Yan explained.\n Lin Dong came to a sudden comprehension after hearing this. He quickly began to feel a little fearful. The Eternal Illusion Demon Flower was indeed impressive. It’s no wonder it was able to trap a peak Reincarnation stage expert, like the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. \n “Let’s not bother about him for now. Whether he awakens or not will depend entirely on him. Let’s first head to the other places in the cave and collect those Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. At the same time, we will also be doing them a huge favour.” Yan smilingly said.\n Lin Dong did not have any objections to this. He could help the Celestial Demon Marten tribe resolve their problems and obtain the exceptionally rare Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers at the same time. This was something that he was glad to oblige to.\n With this thought in mind, Lin Dong turned around and left the cave. Subsequently, he roamed the Heavenly Cave and found many closed caves along the way. Within these caves, were peak experts of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Meanwhile, they were also trapped in the hallucination created by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers.\n Lin Dong waved his hand and collected all of these flowers, which were considered mystical treasures to him. Using the power of the Ancestor Stone, he completely remove the hallucination fragrance within the bodies of these top experts.\n Lin Dong managed to collect quite a sustainable number of flowers along the way. The number of Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers that he had increased from three to nine. Based on what Yan said, the more of those he collected, the more effective it would be for his Mental Energy cultivation.\n There were a couple of caves within the Heavenly Cave that Lin Dong was unable to enter. This was because a seal was placed at their entrance. These seals were placed by those experts, who were currently undergoing a cultivation seclusion within. This caused Lin Dong to feel extremely helpless. He could enter the cave where the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe was in, because he possessed his Essence Blood Feather. Otherwise, he could only standby helplessly at the entrance of his cave.\n The two or three sealed mountain caves were likely occupied by extremely powerful people, who had a high status in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. This was something that Lin Dong deduced simply by standing at the entrance of their caves and quietly gauging the pressure that was being emitted from within.\n Unfortunately, all of them should have also fallen into a hallucination as well. However, Lin Dong could only give up because of the seal placed at their entrance. This was something that they could resolve after the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe left his seclusion.\n Time quietly passed as Lin Dong roamed the interior of the Heavenly Cave. Two days passed by in the blink of an eye. However, Lin Dong was still unable to detect the awakening of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. This caused him to feel a little anxious in his heart. After all, it was almost time for the Celestial Demon Marten tribe to decide on the tribe leader’s successor.\n Lin Dong roamed aimlessly within the Heavenly Cave. There was an Eternal Illusion Demon Flower, which was currently wrapped by symbol chains, in his hand. This terrifying object, which would cause a Samsara stage expert’s expression to change drastically, was currently dancing around randomly like a whip in his hand.\n “It seems like I have reached the end of the Heavenly Cave?”\n Lin Dong suddenly came to a stop. He could sense some resistance appearing in the dark space in front of him. A tinge of shock flashed past his eyes. After a brief moment of hesitation, he extended his hand and gently touched the space in front of him.\n Buzz!\n The dark space in front fluctuated before circular ripples spread. However, no cave appeared behind it.\n “Huh?”\n Lin Dong gasped in surprise. His hand touched the dark space before he vaguely felt extremely ancient and obscure powerful ripples being emitted from within that dark space. That sensation was even stronger than that of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader!\n “Could it be that the one in a seclusion behind this place is some super old demon from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe?”\n Lin Dong muttered to himself. He did not detect the fragrance of the Eternal Illusion Demon Flower from behind. It seems like this was the only place which had not been invaded by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. This caused Lin Dong to be greatly startled. It seems like the mysterious old demon in a seclusion here was terrifyingly powerful. The Celestial Demon Marten tribe indeed possessed an extremely strong foundation.\n Lin Dong did not linger in this place. He merely took a deep glance at the dark space before turning around. He roamed around the place before returning to the cave, where the leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, was located.\n “Huh?”\n Lin Dong became focused when he had just entered the cave, before he immediately lifted his head. His eyes looked towards the stone platform, before he saw the originally unmoving stone like figure, slowly opening his sharp eyes, which had been tightly shut for a hundred years.\n Bang!\n A vast and mighty Yuan Power storm suddenly churned within the cave the moment this figure opened his eyes. The terrifying pressure caused Lin Dong’s body to tremble gently.\n Lin Dong did not feel any fear upon detecting this pressure. Instead, joy rose on his face.\n That old fellow had finally awoken.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1136","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
