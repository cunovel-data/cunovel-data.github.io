As his body moved, the low rumble of thunder emitted from his body. This was the unique sound of flesh and Yuan Power blending together. As this sound gushed out, a feeling of vigorous power followed.\n Lin Dong casually executed a set of fist techniques to warm up his body, and only stopped when sweat could be faintly seen on his forehead. Soon after, his gaze turned towards the room door, as it suddenly gently opened, before Jiang Xue, who was carrying a basin, slowly walked in. Her bright eyes stared at Lin Dong, a faint blush lingering on her exquisite and pretty face.\n “You’re up?” Jiang Xue’s voice was gentle, as she placed the water basin on the table. Then, she wet the towel, and gently wrung it with her jade-like hands, before offering it to Lin Dong. This made her look like an extremely obedient wife. Lin Dong was in a daze as he stared at her. After all, ever since he was young, he had never been so carefully waited on by such a beautiful woman...\n While she was being stared at by Lin Dong, the blush on Jiang Xue’s beautiful face intensified. She lowered her head and softly said: “All… all I can do now, is this…”\n “Haha, thanks.” Lin Dong smiled as he grabbed that warm towel, which still had a lingering trace of her fragrance. After he rubbed his face and wiped of the sweat and dirt, he awkwardly handed back that towel, that was now contained with some black marks, to Jiang Xue.\n Jiang Xue extended her jade-like hands, not minding at all as she received it. The gentle smile on her face was exceptionally warm. Even though this was the first time she had waited on a man, she did not expect that her heart would beat so violently.\n As he stared at Jiang Xue, whose head was now lowered as she quietly washed the towel, Lin Dong scratched his head. Perhaps he was mistaken, however he felt that the way Jiang Xue looked at him today was slightly different. This change seemed to have started last night...\n “There is no need for you to force yourself to serve me. I am not used to this. Even though we have only known each other for a short period of time, I treat you as a genuine friend.” Lin Dong stared at Jiang Xue, and suddenly said.\n Jiang Xue was slightly taken aback. As she lifted her head, her beautiful eyes stared straight into Lin Dong’s. Moments later, an enchanting smile emerged on her beautiful face.\n “Senior sister!”\n Just as the room turned silent, an urgent voice was suddenly heard from outside. Jiang Xue hurriedly turned and left the room. Immediately after, Lin Dong began to hear some voices.\n “Bad news, senior sister! The Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo has suddenly brought their men and surrounded our martial dojo!”\n Within the room, Lin Dong eyes instantly narrowed a little. He stretched his back, and walked out of the room, smiling as he spoke to the now pale Jiang Xue: “Let\u0027s go and check it out…”\n After he finished speaking, he immediately headed for the martial dojo exit. When she saw his actions, Jiang Xue’s face instantly regained some of its colour.\n She suppressed the fear in her heart, took in a deep breath and hurriedly followed behind him.\n ......\n Right now, the Eagle Martial Dojo had been tightly surrounded. The majority of these troops had the same badge on their chests. It was the symbol of the Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo. Evidently, these men were from the Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo.\n Of course, at every part of the Eagle Martial Dojo was filled with a huge amount of people as well. Thee gazes with which they looked to the guys outside was not a friendly one. Of course, everyone in Great Eagle City knew that the Great Eagle Martial Dojo and the Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo were enemies, and both factions detested one another. Therefore, this hostile atmosphere was not odd.\n At the entrance of the martial dojo, Jiang Lei’s was cold like frozen water as he stared at the swarming Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo members. Moments later, he finally spoke in an indifferent voice: “Dojo master Luo Jiu, are you in such a hurry to chase my Eagle Martial Dojo out of Great Eagle City?”\n “Jiang Lei, the issue between my Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo and your Eagle Martial Dojo will be settled in the martial arts arena tomorrow. The reason why I am here today, is because I want you to handover the bastard that hurt my son!”\n At the front of the Bloody Vulture Martial Dojo troops, a middle-aged man was seated on a horse. His figure was quite slim and he wore thin clothes. He had a pair of deep set eyes, and his facial expression was currently exceedingly dark, while a vicious killing intent filled his eyes. Evidently, he was extremely outraged.\n After he shouted out, several men behind him immediately carried out a stretcher. Lying on that stretcher, was Luo Shan, whose entire face was badly mangled. Right now, the latter still seemed to be in a coma. It seems like the slap Lin Dong gave him yesterday was not light at all.\n Jiang Lei glanced at the comatose Luo Shan, as the corners of his eyes slightly twitched. He already heard that Lin Dong had injured Luo Shan yesterday, however, he had evidently not expected that Lin Dong would be this vicious... Nonetheless, this beating felt really satisfying...\n The Martial Eagle Dojo members looked at each other, a similar joyous expression in their eyes. If it was not for the current situation, many of them would have burst out in laughter.\n Though they were able to control themselves, Luo Jiu was still able sense it. Instantly, his already dark facial expression turned increasingly fearsome. He stared maliciously at Jiang Lei, and solemnly said: “If you do not surrender that little bastard now, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”\n “Luo Jiu, do you really think that I am afraid of you!” Jiang Lei sneered. Gripping his palm, his broadsword immediately appeared, as a powerful aura instantly exploded forth.\n “Haha, Jiang Lei, Form Creation stage. I am already at the advanced stage. The difference between us is growing increasingly larger. You dare to challenge me with you current strength?” When he saw this situation, Luo Jiu laughed heartily, his tone clearly disdainful.\n “Try me!”\n Jiang Lei’s eyes were dark. Suddenly, his foot stomped on the ground, as his figure immediately dashed forth. His broadsword generated a formidable momentum, as it ferociously swept towards Luo Jiu, who was seated on his horse.\n “Courting death!”\n When he saw this scene, Luo Jiu’s expression turned serious. His hand grabbed, as an exquisite warhammer immediately appeared within. Then, he slapped his palm against his horse, and his body soared upwards. His warhammer whistled through the air like an avalanche, lightning-quick as it smashed against Jiang Lei’s sword.\n “Clang!”\n A deep roar and a Yuan Power shockwave exploded in mid-air. Jiang Lei’s body was directly blown back by the impact, falling to the ground, and leaving a mark that was a dozen meters long.\n “Hua!”\n When they saw that Jiang Lei was at a disadvantage after the first exchange, the Eagle Martial Dojo members instantly released worrying noises.\n “Since you want a fight, I shall finish you off today!” After his hammer smashed forth, a vicious glint flashed across Luo Jiu’s eyes. Promptly, without any intention of stopping, his figure flashed, and he swooped down like a vulture. The warhammer in his hand carried an extremely terrifying force and Yuan Power undulations, as it viciously hammered down on Jiang Lei.\n “Clang clang!”\n When broadsword and warhammer collided, a waves of sparks exploded, while waves of Yuan Power erupted outwards like a tidal wave, directly causing several cracks to form on the ground. As they watched this intense battle, the troops from both martial dojos felt their hearts quicken, while they stared attentively at the fight.\n “Haha, Jiang Lei, you are still lacking. The difference between an initial and advanced Form Creation stage is not as simple as you think!” The two of them exchanged blows, as Yuan Power violently gushed forth. However, the warhammer was constantly suppressing the broadsword. Every time they crossed blows, the broadsword would tremble after being violently jolted. Meanwhile, fresh blood began to trickle down from the palm that was tightly gripping the broadsword.\n “Clang!”\n Another vicious exchange. A loud sound echoed out, as the broadsword was directly blown away. When he saw this situation, a vicious glint flashed across Luo Jiu’s eyes. Vigorous Yuan Power undulated on the warhammer in his hands, as he immediately smashed it towards Jiang Lei’s chest. Based on the might behind it, if Jiang Lei was hit by that attack, his entire chest would probably explode.\n “Time to die!”\n Luo Jiu’s wore a sinister expression as he slammed down his warhammer. However, just as the warhammer was about to hit Jiang Lei’s body, a formidable strong wind suddenly exploded through the air with a piercing sound.\n “Who?!”\n That sudden gale caused Luo Jiu’s face to turn cold. Instantly, he turned around as his warhammer viciously slammed against the formidable incoming gale.\n “Clang!”\n Sparks violently shot out. However, the outcome that Luo Jiu expected did not occur. An exceedingly strong force was hidden within that gale, as it forcefully jolted his warhammer backwards.\n The massive force that gushed forth, caused Luo Jiu heart to freeze. The warhammer in his hand danced, and shielded his body as he hurriedly retreated. Then, he raised his head, only to see that a young figure had unknowingly appeared in front of Jiang Lei. This figure was holding onto a long halberd, and faintly gave off a dangerous aura.\n “Little bastard, you have finally came out!”\n When he saw this figure, a hideous glint instantly gushed up in Luo Jiu’s eyes. Evidently, he knew that the person before him was the one who had reduced Luo Shan into such a sorry state.\n “If you are smart, cut off the hand that hit my son. Else, I will make you suffer till you beg for your own death!”\n When he heard the hatred in Luo Jiu’s fierce voice, an icy smile emerged on Lin Dong’s face.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-223","bookId":1514,"book":{"id":1514,"title":"Wu Dong Qian Kun","description":"Our Sypnopsis\n The Great Yan Empire exists in a world where respect can only be earned through strength.
