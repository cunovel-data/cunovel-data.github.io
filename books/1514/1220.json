It looked just like an inverted bowl and it covered everyone within. When the crowd saw the Demonic Qi ripples within the light barrier, their faces all paled slightly. That was because they realized that after the Tian Yuanzi trio self-destructed and in addition to the countless disintegrated devil corpses, this part of the world seemed to have turned into a miniature Demonic Qi world. Moreover, it seemed like there were no openings in this demonic world. The originally chaotic and violent battlefield became silent instantly. Meanwhile, those bloodthirsty devil corpses had all vanished. Standing in the sky, the experts from the Yuan Destruction Alliance faced each other, before they turned to look somewhat anxiously at the demonic light barrier in the sky. Following which, a commotion slowly spread. “What should we do now?” Ying Xiaoxiao looked at the growing commotion, before she frowned and softly asked. “The Demonic Qi here is extremely dense. Given our strength, we can still withstand it. However, most ordinary experts cannot stay for too long. Or else, they will eventually be corrupted by the Demonic Qi.” Ying Xuanzi said. “The three great heads of Yuan Gate are quite capable indeed. My Celestial Demon Marten tribe fought with them in the past. However, at that time, they had to band together with many super sects in the Eastern Xuan Region in order to fight with us. Unexpectedly, they became so powerful now.” First elder Zhu Li sighed in a somewhat emotional manner as he said. “This was only because they borrowed the strength of the Yimo. However, such a method will eventually destroy themselves.” Lin Dong said with a pale face. As he stared at the incomparably thick demonic light barrier, he said, “We must find a way to break it.” “I will do it! Let me see just how powerful the darned Devil Feast World is.” Liu Qing parted his lips into a smile before his eyes became stern. Following which, green light surged around him, before thousands of green dragon light tattoos rose around him. After which, he let out a deep cry and transformed into an enormous green dragon. Finally, he whizzed forward and violently slammed against the demonic light barrier. Bang! A circular green light spread and a ripple undulated across the light barrier. However, it gradually calmed down. It turns out that Liu Qing’s formidable attack was completely ineffective. Everyone’s pupils hardened upon seeing this. Following which, a grave expression appeared on Liu Qing’s face before he quickly shook his head and remarked in a deep voice, “It is very powerful indeed.” Even someone as arrogant as him had no choice but to admit that the Devil Feast World was very powerful. As such, one could easily tell how tricky the current situation was. Lin Dong frowned tightly. Currently, he was in a weakened state and was clearly unable to do anything. Moreover, his surroundings were filled with Demonic Qi. Hence, even though he possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, it was impossible for him to absorb all the Demonic Qi here. Therefore, his recovery rate was greatly diminished. “Sect master Ying, young brother Lin Dong, what should we do now?” The sect master of Blade Sect, Mo Jian, and some other experts rushed over. They cupped their hands towards Lin Dong. After witnessing Lin Dong’s frightening strength, it was obvious that they did not dare to act disrespectfully towards the latter. “Why don’t we gather everyone and combine our forces to break the Devil Feast World?” Ying Xiaoxiao suggested. “No. I’m afraid that Yuan Gate had already made advance preparations in this area. Moreover, the three great heads of Yuan Gate self-destructed, causing the Demonic Qi in this area to fall into a never-ending cycle of circulation.” “Although there are many of us, we are all extremely disorganized. Trying to break the Devil Feast World forcefully would only cause our Yuan Power to be assimilated by the Demonic Qi, allowing the Demonic Qi here to become denser.” Ying Huanhuan shook her head and said, “It’s best to break the Devil Feast World using as few people as possible.” “However, if it’s only a few of us… how can we possibly break the Devil Feast World? Moreover, it is obvious that Lin Dong cannot help now.” Ying Xuanzi sighed before he said. Everyone became quiet. Even Liu Qing’s attack was hardly effective. Moreover, who else here besides Lin Dong could surpass Liu Qing? “I will do it.” Amidst the silence, the voices of two ladies suddenly sounded simultaneously. Everyone turned to look, only to realize that the ones who had spoken were actually Ling Qingzhu and Ying Huanhuan. Ying Huanhuan was momentarily startled after she heard Ling Qingzhu’s words. Then, she said in a faint voice, “Although you have advanced to the Samsara stage, with your current strength, there is little you can do to the Devil Feast World.” “We shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, don’t you agree?” Ling Qingzhu looked at Ying Huanhuan similarly pretty icy face before she said. Ying Huanhuan frowned slightly, while her icy blue eyes stared back at Ling Qingzhu. Clearly, she did not trust the latter. Everyone was stunned when they saw the two ladies’ conduct. Soon after, they cast a strange glance at Lin Dong. However, they did not say anything. “Cough.” After being subjected to strange stares from the crowd, Lin Dong could only cough softly. Then, he said, “The both of you should attack together. Perhaps, you guys will have a better chance of success.” Ying Huanhuan finally averted her pretty eyes after she heard Lin Dong’s words. After which, she said, “I will go first. You can help depending on the situation.” Ling Qingzhu had a cool demeanor and did not like to compete with others. In fact, she only stepped forward today owing to the gravity of the situation. Hence, she did not say anything more after she saw Ying Huanhuan giving in. Instead, she merely nodded her head gently. Ying Huanhuan took a couple of steps gently and slowly walked forward. Soon after, a frightening cold aura was emitted from within her body. Following which, the surrounding air agglomerated into icy flowers before they drifted downwards. Cold aura was circling around her body. After which, Ying Huanhuan slowly shut her eyes. Everyone could see her icy blue long hair gradually becoming longer after she did so. Moreover, that icy blue color was becoming increasingly intense. Her icy blue long hair was drifting behind her back. Looking from afar, it resembled an icy blue waterfall. Meanwhile, her beauty was accompanied by a bone chilling iciness. Behind her, when Lin Dong saw the icy blue long hair growing on Ying Huanhuan’s head, he involuntarily clenched his fist. “Eternal Ice Seal Halberd.” A clear lovely voice, which was filled with endless chill, suddenly sounded. Following which, Ying Huanhuan suddenly opened her pretty eyes before she used her delicate finger to draw a mysterious ice symbol. After which, icy blue light surged before a dazzling cold ice halberd swiftly formed in front of her. Meanwhile, that ice halberd was covered with mysterious symbols. Swoosh! The surrounding temperature immediately dropped after the ice halberd appeared. After which, Ying Huanhuan gently bit the tip of her tongue before a drop of essence blood landed onto her ice halberd. Immediately, the color of that ice halberd changed from icy blue to dark red. Meanwhile, a formidable sharp icy chill spread. “Go!” Ying Huanhuan’s pretty pupils hardened. With a cold cry, her dark red ice halberd shot forward abruptly. Following which, wild gales spread, scattering her long icy blue hair and causing them to dance in the wind. At this moment, her delicate figure was just like a pretty blossoming flower and she looked extremely dazzling. Swoosh! The dark red ice halberd easily tore through many layers of Demonic Qi. Finally, it collided violently against the demonic light barrier. Immediately, a frightening chill spread before the overbearing cold aura instantly froze the Demonic Qi, which was surging over. Crack. A small crack suddenly appeared on the demonic light barrier. However, at the same time, a crack also appeared on that huge dark red ice halberd. The two cracks continued to grow. However, it was clear that the crack on the ice halberd was growing at a faster pace. In less than a dozen breaths, the crack on the demonic light barrier was already hundreds of feet. However, just as the thick demonic light barrier was about to break, that dark red ice halberd shattered with a loud ‘bang’. Immediately, Ying Huanhuan emitted a soft moan before a trace of blood seeped out from her lips. After which, her body shook before she flew backwards. Standing behind her, Lin Dong immediately rushed forward upon seeing this. Then, he grabbed her delicate soft waist before he supported her. “Swoosh! Beside him, Ling Qingzhu rushed forward the instant Lin Dong moved. Her legs gently tapped against the empty space. Following which, she clenched her hand before a longsword appeared in a flash. With that longsword in her jade like hands, she retracted the aura undulated on her entire body. Following which, an extremely obscure light was suddenly emitted above her head. Meanwhile, an indescribable fluctuation spread quietly. “Is this…” The moment that light was emitted, Lin Dong clearly heard Yan exclaim in shock. “What is it?” Lin Dong quickly asked. However, Yan had suddenly descended into silence. In fact, only the gentle vibrations from the Ancestor Stone proved that there were indeed ripples within Yan’s heart. Although he had his doubts, Lin Dong knew that now was not the time for questions. Hence, he quickly turned his attention towards Ling Qingzhu. Currently, she was holding a longsword in her hand, before she suddenly pierced forward gently. There wasn’t overly majestic Yuan Power undulated on her sword. However, it was covered by a mysterious thin layer of light. Nonetheless, that light even caused Lin Dong to feel a prickling chill on his skin. That sword pierced forward before an inconspicuous sword glow shot forward. Then, it penetrated through space before it gently landed on the crack that Ying Huanhuan had created previously. In the next instant, the sword glow and monstrous Demonic Qi faced off. After which, everyone heard a ‘puff’ sound, before the glowing sword penetrated the Demonic Qi and stabbed through the crack on the demonic light barrier. A ray of sunlight penetrated the crack and shone down. After which, Yuan Power from the outside world surged in and immediately disrupted the cycle within the Devil Feast World. Following which, densely packed crack lines began to spread all across the light barrier, before it finally exploded with a loud ‘bang’. Warm sunlight once again descended from all directions. When everyone saw the sunlight in front of them and the lush greenery in the distance, they involuntarily erupted with joy. After all, they knew that they had just survived a massive tribulation. They had finally won this fight. Lin Dong inhaled a deep breath of air. Meanwhile, he began to circulate the Devouring Power within his body. When he sensed that incoming natural Yuan Power, a relieved smile appeared on his face. “It’s finally over…” Ying Xuanzi involuntarily smiled. Yuan Gate was finally destroyed and the war in the Eastern Xuan Region had finally came to an end. The other experts from the Eastern Xuan Region were all extremely excited. After all, now that Yuan Gate was destroyed, they had finally gotten their revenge. Moreover, they could now continue to live in this region. A pale color appeared on Ling Qingzhu’s gorgeous face. After which, she glanced at Ying Huanhuan, who was now being embraced by Lin Dong. Then, she lowered her head before she slowly inserted her longsword back into its scabbard. “Are the both of you alright?” Lin Dong had sharp eyes. Hence, he quickly asked in a worried tone after he saw the pale expression on Ling Qingzhu’s face. Ling Qingzhu and Ying Huanhuan both shook their heads. They were just about to speak when their pretty eyes hardened. Meanwhile, Lin Dong’s expression also changed at the same time. He slowly turned his head before he cast his attention towards a distant mountain top. There was a black figure standing at that spot like a statue, with his hands behind his back. He gave off no aura and it was completely impossible to detect him. However, his body did exist at that spot. Hence, this strange sensation caused the expressions of Lin Dong’s group to turn grave. “Haha, a trap that was set up over so many years was actually destroyed in this manner… What a waste.” The black figure looked at Lin Dong’s group. After which, his eyes paused on Ying Huanhuan before he smiled gently and asked, “Ice Master, it has been tens of thousands of years since we last met.
