{"id":32518,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER VII. At Lawyer St. Henry\u0027s.","content":"Lawyer St. Henry sat at his well-spread breakfast table. He was a little man with a bald head and good-natured face, who enjoyed his breakfast as well as all his other meals. Since his nieces had considered it necessary to their spiritual welfare to attend matins at St. Jerome\u0027s, the lawyer had been condemned to breakfast alone. The sun shone on the street, and Mr. St. Henry sat in a room that faced it. Through the wire blinds he could see all the passings and re-passings of his neighbours; which he very well liked to do; as well as the doings of Paradise Row opposite. \"Hallo!\" he cried, catching sight of a face at Mrs. Jinks\u0027s parlour window, \"Cattacomb\u0027s not gone out this morning! Puff must have come over early to officiate. Thinks he\u0027ll take it easy, I suppose, now he\u0027s got an underling: no blame to him, either. The girls will be dished for once. Nobody goes down with \u0027em like Cattacomb.\" Laughing a little at the thought, he helped himself to a portion of a tempting-looking cutlet surrounded with mushrooms. This being nearly despatched, he had leisure to look abroad again and make his mental comments. \"There goes the doctor: he\u0027s out early this morning. Going to see old Etheredge, perhaps: wonder how the old fellow is. And there\u0027s Mother Jinks taking in a sweetbread. Must be for the parson\u0027s breakfast. Sweetbreads are uncommonly good, too: I\u0027ll have one myself to-morrow morning if it can be got. Why, here comes Sir Karl Andinnian! He is out early, too. That young man looks to me as though he had some care upon him. It\u0027s a nice countenance; very: and if--I declare he is coming here! What on earth can he want?\" Sir. Karl Andinnian was ringing the door-bell. It has been already said that the lawyer\u0027s offices were in Basham, for which place he generally started as soon as breakfast was over. Therefore, if any client wished to see him at Foxwood, it had to be early in the morning or late in the evening. This was known and understood. Sir Karl was shown in, Mr. St. Henry glancing at his breakfast-table and the three or four dirty plates upon it. He had finished now, and they sat down together at the window. Sir Karl, not to detain him unnecessarily, entered at once upon the question he had come to ask--Had he, or had he not, power to do anything with St. Jerome\u0027s? And the lawyer laughed a little; for St. Jerome\u0027s afforded him fun, rather than otherwise. \"Of course, Sir Karl, if Truefit choose to warn them off the land, he could do it,\" was the lawyer\u0027s reply. \"Not without notice, though, I think: I don\u0027t know what the agreement was. As to yourself--well I am not clear whether you could do anything: I should like to see Truefit\u0027s lease before giving an opinion. But, if they were shut out of St. Jerome\u0027s to-day, they\u0027d contrive to start another place to-morrow.\" \"That is quite likely,\" said Karl. \"My advice to you is this, Sir Karl: don\u0027t bother yourself about it,\" said the easy-going lawyer. \"People expect you to interfere? Never mind that: let them expect. The thing will die away of itself when winter comes. Once the frost and snow set in, the girls, silly monkeys, won\u0027t be trapesing to St. Jerome\u0027s; neither will they come jinketing over by omnibusfuls from Basham. Wait and shut it up then. If you attempt to do it now, you will meet with wide opposition: by waiting, you may do it almost without any.\" \"You really think so?\" \"I am nearly sure so,\" said the hearty lawyer. \"There\u0027s nothing like bad weather for stopping expeditions of chivalry. But for having had the continuous sunshine the summer has given us, St. Jerome\u0027s would not have been the success it is.\" \"They have dressed Torn Pepp in a conical cap, and put a red cross all down his back outside,\" said Sir Karl. The lawyer burst into a laugh. \"I know,\" he said. \"I hear of the vagaries from my nieces. It\u0027s fun for me. They go in for them wholesale, and come home with their heads full.\" \"But it is not religion, Mr. St. Henry.\" \"Bless me, no. Religion? The girls may give it that name; and perhaps one or two among them may be earnest enough in thinking it so; the rest are only after Cattacomb.\" \"There\u0027s another one now, I hear. One Puff.\" \"And a fine puff of wind he is. Got no more brains than a gander. I\u0027ll see Truefit and inquire what agreement it was he made with them, if you like, Sir Karl; but I should certainly recommend you to leave the matter alone a little longer.\" Sir Karl thought he would accept the advice; and got up to leave. He often saw Truefit about the land, and could take an opportunity of questioning him himself. As he stood for a moment at the window, there passed down the middle of the street a stranger, walking slowly; that is, a stranger to Karl. It was Mr. Strange. Now it happened that Karl had never yet seen this man--at least, he had never noticed him. For the detective, being warned by Grimley that Sir Karl had, or seemed to have, some reason for screening Salter--had kept out of Sir Karl\u0027s way. He thought it would not conduce at all to his success to let Sir Karl know he was down there on the scent. Therefore, whenever he had observed Sir Karl coming along--and he had kept his eyes sharply open--he had popped into a shop, or drawn behind a hedge, or got over a style into another field. And Karl, in his mind\u0027s abstraction--for it nearly always was abstracted, lost in its own fear and pain--had not thought of looking out gratuitously for strangers. But, standing up at the lawyer\u0027s window, the street close before him, he could not fail to observe those who passed up and down: and his attention was at once drawn to this man. \"Who is that?\" he asked. \"That! oh, that\u0027s a Mr. Strange,\" said the lawyer, laughing again--and in his laugh this time there was something significant. \"At least, that\u0027s his name here.\" \"And not elsewhere?\" \"I fancy not.\" \"Is he staying at Foxwood? What is he doing here?\" \"He is certainly staying at Foxwood. As to his business, I conclude it is something in the private detective line, Sir Karl.\" Mr. Strange, whose attention in passing had been directed to some matter on the other side of the way and not to the lawyer\u0027s window, consequently he did not know that he was being watched, had halted a little lower down to speak to the landlord of the Red Lion. All in a moment, as Karl looked at him, the notion flashed into his mind that this man bore a strong resemblance to the description given by Ann Hopley of the man who had invaded the Maze. The notion came to him in the self-same moment that the words of the lawyer fell on his ears--\"His business, I conclude, is something in the private detective line.\" What with the notion, and what with the words, Karl Andinnian fell into a confused inward tumult, that caused his heart\u0027s blood to stop, and then course wildly on. Business at Foxwood, connected with detectives, must have reference to his brother, and to him alone. \"A slight-made gentleman with a fair face and light curly hair, looking about thirty,\" had been Ann Hopley\u0027s description; it answered in every particular to the man Karl was gazing at; gazing until he watched him out of sight. Lawyer St. Henry, naturally observant, thought his guest stared after the man as though he held some peculiar interest in him. \"Do you know who that man really is, Mr. St. Henry?\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Sir Karl. No reason why I should not, for I have not been told to keep it a secret. Some little time back, my nieces grew full of the new lodger at Mrs. Jinks\u0027s; they were talking of him incessantly: A gentleman reading divinity----\" \"Why, that\u0027s Mr. Cattacomb,\" interrupted Sir Karl. \"He lodges at Mrs. Jinks\u0027s.\" \"Not that ladies\u0027 idiot,\" cried the lawyer, rather roughly. \"I beg your pardon, Sir Karl, but the Reverend Guy sometimes puts me out of patience. This man has the upper rooms, Cattacomb the lower----\" \"But I--I thought that was a boy: a lad at his studies,\" reiterated Karl, in some perplexity. \"I assumed him to be a pupil of Cattacomb\u0027s.\" \"It is the man you have just watched down the street, Sir Karl. Well, to go on. My nieces were always talking of this new gentleman, a Mr. Strange, who had come to Foxwood to get up his health, and to read up for some divinity examination. That was their account. They said so much about him that I got curious myself: it was a new face, you see, Sir Karl, and girls go wild over that. One morning when I was starting for the office, the gig at the door, Jane ran out to me. \u0027Uncle,\u0027 she said, \u0027that\u0027s Mr. Strange coming down Mrs. Jinks\u0027s steps now: you can see him if you look.\u0027 I did look, Sir Karl, and saw the gentleman you have just seen pass. His face struck me at once as one that I was familiar with, though at the moment I could not tell where I had seen him. Remembrance came to me while I looked--and I knew him for an officer connected with the detective force at Scotland Yard.\" Karl drew a long breath. He was listening greedily. \"About a year ago,\" resumed the lawyer, \"my agent in London, Mr. Blair, had occasion to employ a detective upon some matter he was engaged in. I was in London for a few days at that time, and saw the man twice at Blair\u0027s--and knew him again now. It was this same Mr. Strange.\" \"And you say Strange is not his right name?\" \"No, it\u0027s not.\" \"What is the right one?\" \"Well, I can\u0027t tell you the right one, Sir Karl, for I cannot remember it. I am sure of one thing--that it was not Strange. It was a longer name, and I think rather a peculiar name; but I can\u0027t hit upon it. He must be down here on some private business, and has no doubt his own reasons for keeping incog. I recollect Blair told me he was one of the astutest officers in the detective force.\" \"Has he recognised you?\" \"He could not recognise me,\" said Mr. St. Henry, \"I don\u0027t suppose he ever saw me to notice me. Each time that he called on Blair, it happened that I was in the front office with the clerks when he passed through it. He was not likely to have observed me.\" \"You have not spoken to him, then?\" \"Not I.\" \"And--you don\u0027t know what his business here may be.\" \"Not at all. Can\u0027t guess at it. It concerns neither you nor me, Sir Karl, and therefore I have not scrupled to tell you so much. Of course you will not repeat it again. If he chooses to remain unknown here, and pass himself off for a student of divinity--doubtless for sufficient reasons--I should not be justified in proclaiming that he is a London detective, and so possibly ruin his game.\" Sir Karl made a motion of acquiescence. His brain was whirling in no measured degree. He connected the presence of this detective at Foxwood with the paragraph that had appeared in the newspaper touching the escaped convict from Portland Island. \"Would there--would there be any possibility of getting to know his business?\" he dreamily asked. \"Not the slightest, I should say, unless he chooses directly to disclose it. Why? You cannot have any interest in it, I presume, Sir Karl, whatever it may be.\" \"No, no; certainly not,\" replied Sir Karl, awaking to the fact that he was on dangerous ground. \"One is apt to get curious on hearing of business connected with detectives,\" he added, laughing; \"as interested as one does in a good novel.\" \"Ay, true,\" said the lawyer, unsuspiciously. \"At Mrs. Jinks\u0027s he is lodging, is he?\" absently remarked Karl, turning to depart; and inwardly marvelling how he could have caught up the notion that the person there was only a lad, a pupil of Cattacomb\u0027s. \"At Mrs. Jinks\u0027s, Sir Karl; got her drawing-room. Wonder how the Rev. Guy would feel if he knew the man over his head was a cute detective officer?\" \"I suppose the officer cannot be looking after him,\" jested Sir Karl. \"St. Jerome\u0027s is the least sound thing we know at Foxwood.\" The lawyer laughed a hearty laugh as he attended Sir Karl to the door; at which Mr. St. Henry\u0027s gig was now waiting to take him into Basham. It was not a hot morning, but Karl Andinnian took off his hat repeatedly on the way home to wipe his brow. The dreadful catastrophe he had been fearing for his unfortunate brother seemed to be drawing ominously near. \"But for that confounded Smith, Adam might have been away before,\" he groaned. \"I know he might. Smith----\" And there Karl stopped; stopped as though his speech had been suddenly cut off. For a new idea had darted into his mind, and he stayed to ponder it. Was this detective officer down here to look after Philip Salter?--and not after Adam at all? A conviction, that it must be so, took possession of him; and in the first flush of it the relief was inexpressibly great. But he remembered again the midnight watcher of the Maze and the morning visit following it; and his hopes fell back to zero. That this was the same man who had watched there could remain no doubt whatever. Passing into his own room, Karl sat down and strove to think the matter out. He could arrive at no certain conclusion. One minute he felt sure the object was his brother; the next, that it was only Salter. But, in any case, allowing that it was Salter, there must be danger to Adam. If this cunning London detective were to get into the Maze premises again and see the prisoner there, all would be over. The probability was, that he was personally acquainted with the noted criminal Adam Andinnian: and it might be, that he had gained a suspicion that Adam Andinnian was alive. One thing Karl could not conceal from himself--and it brought to him a rush of remorse. If the detective had come down after Salter, he--he, Karl--must have been the means of bringing him there. But for that unpleasant consciousness he would have gone straight off to Smith the agent, and told him of the trouble that was threatening Adam, and said, \"What shall we do in it; how screen him?\" But he did not dare. He did not dare to make a move or stir a step that might bring Smith and the detective in contact. He could not quite understand why, if Smith were really Salter, the detective had not already pounced upon him: but he thought it quite likely that Smith might be keeping himself out of sight. In short, the thoughts and surmises that crossed and recrossed Karl\u0027s brain, some probable enough, others quite improbable, were legion. Not for the world, if he could help it, would he aid--further than he had perhaps unhappily aided--in denouncing Salter; and knowing what he had done, he could not face the man. He had never intended to harm him. So there Karl was, overwhelmed with this new perplexity, and not able to stir in it. He saw not what he could do. To address the detective himself, and say whom are you after, would be worse than folly; of all people he, Karl Andinnian, must keep aloof from him. It might be that there was only a suspicion about Adam\u0027s being alive, that they were trying to find out whether it was so or not. For him, Karl, to interfere or show interest, would help it on. But this suspense was well nigh intolerable. Karl could not live under it. Something he must do. If only he could set the question at rest, as to which of the two criminals the detective was after, it would be a good deal gained. And he could only do that by applying to Mr. Burtenshaw. It was not sure that he would, but there was a chance that he might. Lady Andinnian was in her little sitting-room upstairs, when she heard Sir Karl\u0027s footstep. He entered without knocking: which was very unusual. For they had grown ceremonious one with another since the estrangement and knocked at doors and asked permission to enter, as strangers. Lucy was adding up her housekeeping bills. \"I am going to London, Lucy. Some business has arisen that I am very anxious about, and I must go up at once.\" \"Business with Plunkett and Plunkett?\" she asked, a slight sarcasm in her tone, though Karl detected it not, as she remembered the plea he had urged for the journey once before. \"No, not with Plunkett and Plunkett. The business, though, is the same that has been troubling my peace all the summer. I think I shall be home tonight, Lucy: but if I cannot see the person I am going up to see, I may have to wait in town until to-morrow. Should the last train not bring me down, you will know the reason.\" \"Of course your movements are your own, Sir Karl.\" He sighed a little, and stood looking from the window. The first train he could catch would not go by for nearly an hour, so he had ample time to spare. Lucy spoke. \"I was going to ask you for some money. I have scarcely enough, I think, for these bills.\" \"Can you wait until I return, Lucy? I have not much more in the house than I shall want. Or shall I give you a cheque? Hewitt can go to the bank at Basham and cash it.\" \"Oh I can wait quite well. There\u0027s no hurry for a day or two.\" \"You shall have it to-morrow in any case. If I stay away as long as that I shall be sure to return during banking hours, and will get out at Basham and draw some money.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Goodbye, Lucy.\" She held out her hand in answer to his, and wished him goodbye in return. He kept it for a minute in his, stooped and kissed her cheek. It brought a rush of colour to her face, but she said nothing. Only drew away her hand, bent over her figures again, and began adding them up steadily. He passed round to his chamber, putting a few things in a hand-bag in case he had to stay away the night. Then he went down to his room and penned a few lines to Adam, entreating him to be unusually cautious. The note was enclosed in an outer envelope, addressed to Mrs. Grey. He rang the bell for Hewitt, and proceeded to lock his desk. \"I want you to go over to the Maze, Hewitt,\" he said in a low tone--and had got so far when, happening to raise his eyes, he saw it was Giles and not Hewitt who had entered. Karl had his wits about him, and Hewitt came in at the moment. \"Hewitt, I want you to step over to the Maze and inquire whether the plumbers have been there yet. There\u0027s something wrong with a drain. Ask the servants at the same time how their mistress is getting on. And----\" Giles had stood gaping and listening. Karl broke off to bid him look for his umbrella. \"No message, Hewitt, and no answer,\" breathed his master, as he handed him the note. \"Put it in your pocket.\" \"All right, sir,\" nodded Hewitt, and was away before Giles came back with the umbrella. And Karl got off at last. Perhaps Mr. Burtenshaw was astonished, perhaps not, to see Sir Karl Andinnian enter that same afternoon. He, the detective, was poring over his papers, as usual, but he turned from them to salute his visitor. \"Will you take a seat, Sir Karl, for two minutes. After that, I am at your service.\" \"You know me, then, Mr. Burtenshaw!\" exclaimed Karl. \"The man who happened to come into the room with Grimley, the last time you were here, sir, said you were Sir Karl Andinnian,\" replied the officer without scruple. \"Take a seat, sir, pray.\" Mr. Burtenshaw placed four or five letters, already written, within their envelopes, directed, and stamped them. Then he quitted the room, probably to send them to the post, came in again, and drew a chair in front of Karl. \"He is looking worse than ever,\" was the mental summary of the detective--\"but what a nice face it is!\" Ay, it was. The pale, beautiful features, their refined expression, the thoughtfulness in the sweet grey eyes, and the strange sadness that pervaded every lineament, made a picture that was singularly attractive. Karl had one glove off; and the diamond and opal ring he always wore in remembrance of his father flashed in the sunlight. For the buff blinds were not down to-day. He had wished to give the ring back to his brother, when he found he had no right to it himself, but Adam had insisted upon his keeping it and wearing it, lest \"the world might inquire where the ring was gone.\" Another little deceit, as it always seemed to Karl. \"I have called here, Mr. Burtenshaw, to ask you to answer me a question honestly. Have you--stay though,\" he broke off. \"As you know me, I presume you know where I live?\" \"Quite well, Sir Karl. I was at the Court once in Sir Joseph Andinnian\u0027s time.\" \"Ay, of course you would know it. Now for my question. Have you sent a detective officer down to Foxwood after Philip Salter?\" \"I have not,\" replied Mr. Burtenshaw, with, Karl thought, a stress upon the \"I.\" \"But you know that one is there?\" \"Why do you ask me this?\" cried Mr. Burtenshaw, making no immediate reply. \"Because I have reason to believe, in fact to know, that a detective officer is at Foxwood, and I wish to ascertain what he is there for. I presume it can only be to search after Philip Salter.\" \"And what if it were?\" asked Mr. Burtenshaw. \"Nothing. Nothing that could in any way affect you. I want to ascertain it, yes or no, for my own private and individual satisfaction.\" \"Well, you are right, Sir Karl. One of our men has gone down there with that object.\" Karl paused. \"I suppose I have led to it,\" he said. \"That is, that it has been done in consequence of the inquiries I made of you.\" \"Of those you made of Grimley, sir, not of me. I had nothing to do with sending Tatton down----\" Karl caught at the name. \"Tatton, do you call him?\" he interrupted. And Mr. Burtenshaw nodded. \"He calls himself \u0027Strange\u0027 down there.\" \"Oh, does he? He knows what he is about, Sir Karl, rely upon it.\" \"Who did send him down?\" \"Scotland Yard. It appears that Grimley, taking up the notion through you that he had found a clue to the retreat of Salter, went to Scotland Yard, announced that Salter was in hiding somewhere in the neighbourhood of Foxwood, and asked that a search should be set on foot for him.\" Karl sat thinking. If the man Tatton went down after Philip Salter, what brought him within the grounds of the Maze, watching the house at night? Whence also that endeavour to get in by day, and his questions to Ann Hopley? Was it Tatton who did this?--or were there two men, Strange and Tatton? \"What sort of a man is Tatton?\" he asked aloud. \"Slight and fair?\" \"Slight and fair; about thirty years of age, Sir Karl. Curly hair.\" \"They must be the same,\" mentally decided Karl. \"I presume,\" he said, lifting his head, \"that Tatton must have started on this expedition soon after I was here last?\" \"The following day, I think.\" \"Then he has been at Foxwood over long. More than long enough to have found Salter if Salter\u0027s there, Mr. Burtenshaw.\" \"That depends upon circumstances, Sir Karl,\" replied the detective, with a wary smile. \"I could tell you of a case where an escaped man was being looked after for twelve months before he was unearthed--and he had been close at hand all the while. They have as many ruses as a fox, these fugitives.\" \"Nevertheless, as Tatton has not yet found Salter, I should consider it a tolerably sure proof that Salter is not at Foxwood.\" Mr. Burtenshaw threw a penetrating gaze at his visitor. \"Will you undertake to give me your word, Sir Karl, that you do not know Philip Salter to be at Foxwood?\" \"On my word and honour I do not know him to be there,\" said Karl, decisively. \"I should think he is not there.\" He spoke but in accordance with his opinion. The conviction had been gaining upon him the last few minutes that he must have been in error in suspecting Smith to be the man. How else was it, if he was the man, that Tatton had not found him? \"Salter is there,\" said the detective--and Karl pricked up his ears to hear the decisive assertion. \"We have positive information from Tatton that he is on his trail:--I am not sure but he has seen him. For the first week or two of Tatton\u0027s sojourn there, he could discover no trace whatever of the man or his hiding-place; but accident gave him a clue, and he has found both: found his hiding-place and found him.\" \"Then why does he not lay his hands upon him?\" returned Karl, veering round again to the impression that it must be Smith. \"It is only a question of time, Sir Karl. No doubt he has good reasons for his delay. To know where a man is hiding may be one thing; to capture him quite another. Too much haste sometimes mars the game.\" \"Tatton is going to remain at Foxwood, then?\" \"Until the capture is accomplished, certainly.\" Karl\u0027s heart sunk within him at the answer. While Tatton was delaying his capture of Smith, he might be getting a clue to another escaped fugitive down there--Adam Andinnian. Nay, had he not already the clue? Might not this very delay be caused by some crafty scheme to take both criminals at once--to kill two birds with one stone? He asked one more question. \"Mr. Burtenshaw, how was it that suspicion was directed at all to Foxwood?\" \"Grimley took up the notion after your second visit here, Sir Karl, that you had a suspicion of Salter yourself. I thought you understood this. Grimley fancied you were in the habit of seeing some one whom you believed, but did not feel quite sure, might be Salter. And he judged that the individual, whether it was Salter or not, must be in hiding near your dwelling-place--Foxwood.\" Ay; Karl saw how it was. He had done this. He and no other, had brought this additional danger upon his ill-fated brother, whom he would willingly have given his own life to shield. There was nothing more to be asked of Mr. Burtenshaw: he had learnt all he came to hear. And Sir Karl with his load of care returned to Foxwood by the evening train.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2701/74255.html","bookId":1457,"book":{"id":1457,"title":"Within the Maze","description":"简介： The house was ugly and old-fashioned, with some added modern improvements, and was surrounded by a really beautiful garden.
