{"id":32497,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. In the Avenue d\u0027Antin","content":"New Year\u0027s Day. Or, as the French more emphatically term it, the Jour de l\u0027An. Gay groups went strolling along the Boulevards in the glowing sunshine, gazing at the costly étrennes displayed in the tempting shops: women glancing at the perfect attire of other women that passed; men doffing their hats so perpetually that it almost seemed they might as well have kept them off altogether; children in their fantastic costumes chattering to their mothers, and turning their little heads on all sides: all, men, women, and children, apparently free from every care, save that of pleasure, which constitutes so observable a feature in Parisian life. Amidst the crowd, passing onwards with a listless step, as if pleasure had no part in his heart and he had no use for étrennes, was a solitary individual: a distinguished looking man of pleasing features and altogether refined face, whom few of the traversers could have mistaken for aught but an Englishman. His mourning apparel and a certain air of sadness that pervaded his face seemed to be in unison. Several women--ingrained coquettes from their birth, as French women nearly always are born to be--threw glances of admiration at the handsome man, in spite of the fact that their husbands--for that one day--were at their side; and wondered what near relative he had lost. But the gentleman passed on his listless way, seeing them not, and utterly unconscious that any answering glances from his own eyes were coveted. It was Sir Karl Andinnian. Close upon the burial of his ill-fated brother Adam, Mrs. Andinnian, prostrate with grief and trouble, took to confine herself to her own apartment at Foxwood Court: for it was at that residence she thenceforth took up her abode. Karl found himself nearly altogether excluded from her presence. Even at meals she declined to join him, and caused them to be served for herself apart. \"Do you wish me away from Foxwood?\" Karl one day asked her. \"I do; I would be entirely alone,\" was her reply. \"I am aware that Foxwood is yours now, Karl, and you may think I have no right even to express a hint that you might for a time leave it; but I feel that the chance of my regaining strength and spirits would be greater if left entirely to myself: your presence here is a strain upon me.\" The answer was to Karl welcome as sunshine in harvest. He had been longing to travel; to try and find some relief from his thoughts in hitherto untrodden scenes: consideration for his mother--the consciousness that it would be wrong both in duty and affection to leave her--had alone prevented his proposing it. Within four-and-twenty hours after this he had quitted Foxwood. But Karl was not so soon to quit England. Various matters had to be settled in regard to the estate; and when he reached London his lawyers, Plunkett and Plunkett, said they should want him for a little while. The crime committed by Sir Adam so immediately upon the death of Sir Joseph, had caused a vast deal of necessary business to remain in abeyance. Certain indispensable law proceedings to be gone through, had to be gone through now. So Karl Andinnian perforce took up his temporary abode in London; and at the end of a week or two, when he found himself at liberty, he crossed over the water, Vienna being his first halting place. The sojourn there of a former brother officer, Captain Lamprey, who had been Karl\u0027s chiefest friend and stuck to him in his misfortunes, induced it. Captain Lamprey was staying in Vienna with his newly married wife, and he wrote to ask Karl to join them. Karl did so. Captain Lamprey\u0027s term of leave expired the end of December. He and his wife were going home to spend the Christmas, and Karl accompanied them as far as Paris. Mrs. Andinnian, in answer to a question from Karl, whether she would like him to return to her for Christmas, had written back to him a resolute and ungracious No. So here he was, in Paris. It was all the same to him; this resting-place or that resting-place. His life had been blighted in more ways than one. Of Lucy Cleeve he thought still a great deal too much for his peace. She was far enough removed from him in all senses of the word. In a letter received by Captain Lamprey from some friends at Winchester, it was stated that the Cleeves were wintering in Egypt. Where Karl\u0027s own place of sojourn was next to be, he had not decided, but his thoughts rather turned towards every chief continental city that was famed for its gallery of paintings. He thought he would make a pilgrimage to all of them. Karl had the eye of a true artist: to gaze at good paintings was now the only pleasure of his life. He had not yet anything like done with those in Paris and Versailles. On, upon his course along the Boulevards, passed he. Now and again his eyes turned towards the lovely étrennes with a longing: once in a way, when the throngs allowed him, he halted to look and admire: a longing to buy étrennes himself, and that he had some one to give them to when bought. It was not well possible for any body to feel more completely isolated from the happy world than did Karl Andinnian. \"How d\u0027ye do, Sir Karl? Charming day for the holiday, is it not!\" Sir Karl made some answering assent, raised his hat, bowed, and passed on. The remark had come from an Englishman with whom he had a slight acquaintance, who had come out shop-gazing with his flock of daughters. He went straight home then to his hotel--Hotel Montaigne, Rue Montaigne. As he crossed the courtyard, the landlord--a ponderous gentleman with a ponderous watch-chain--came out and gave him some letters. From some cause the English delivery had been late that morning. One of the letters was from Captain Lamprey, the other from Plunkett and Plunkett. Neither contained any interest; neither thought to wish him happiness for the New Year. It was all the same to Karl Andinnian: the New Year could not have much happiness in store for him. He strolled out again, turning his steps towards the Champs Elysées. It was but one o\u0027clock yet, and the brightest part of the day. At one of the windows of the palace he fancied he caught a transient glimpse of the Empress. Shortly afterwards, the peculiar clatter of the Prince Imperial\u0027s escort was heard advancing, surrounding the little prince in his carriage. The Champs Elysées were bright to-day. Children attired in silks and satins were playing in the sun, their bonnes sitting by in their holiday costume. New Year\u0027s Day and All Saints\u0027 Day are the two most dressy epochs in the year in France--as everybody knows. Invalids sat in the warmth: ladies flitted hither and thither like gay butterflies. By a mere chance, Karl always thought it so, his eyes fell on two ladies seated alone on a distant bench. Involuntarily his steps halted; his heart leaped up with a joyous bound. They were Mrs. and Miss Cleeve. But, ah how ill she looked--Lucy. The bounding heart fell again as though some dead weight were pressing it. Thin, worn, white; with dark circles round the eyes, and lips that seemed to have no life in them. For a moment Karl wondered whether he might not approach and question her: but he remembered his bargain with Colonel Cleeve. They did not see him: they were looking at some children in front of them; playing at \"Marlborough s\u0027en va-t-en guerre.\" Karl pursued the path he was on, which would carry him away from their bench at right angles. He resolved that if they saw him he would go up and speak: if they did not, he must continue his way. And he had to continue it. Mrs. Cleeve, Who did not look to be in strong health either, seemed absorbed by the play and the childish voices chanting the chanson; Lucy had now bent her forehead upon her hand, as though some ache were there. Karl went on, out of sight, his brow aching too. \"Bon jour, monsieur.\" The salutation, which had a touch of surprised pleasure in its tone, came from a natty-looking little Frenchwoman, with a thin red face and shrewd grey eyes. She might have been given five-and-thirty years: but in the register of her native Mairie she would have been found hard upon forty. Sir Karl stopped. She was Lucy\u0027s maid: formerly Lucy\u0027s nurse. \"C\u0027est vous, Aglaé!\" \"Mais oui, monsieur.\" \"I thought I saw Mrs. and Miss Cleeve sitting on a bench just now,\" continued Karl; changing his language. \"Are you staying in Paris?\" \"Oh, very long since,\" replied Aglaé, to whom both languages were nearly alike. \"Our apartment is close by, sir--a small house in the Avenue d\u0027Antin. The delight to find myself in my proper land again, where I can go about without one of those vilain bonnets and hear no street gamins hoot at me for it, is untellable.\" \"I understood that Colonel Cleeve and his family had gone to Egypt for the winter,\" observed Karl. \"To Egypt, or to some other place of barbarisme: so it was projected, sir. But my young lady, Miss Lucy, is not strong enough to be taken.\" \"What is the matter with her?\" asked Karl, with assumed quietness. \"The matter? Oh! The matter is, that she has got no happiness left in her heart, sir,\" cried Aglaé, explosively, as if in deep resentment against things in general. \"It\u0027s dried up. And if they don\u0027t mind, she will just go unwarningly out of life. That\u0027s my opinion: and, mind, sir, I do not go to say it without reason.\" A slight blush mantled in Karl\u0027s face. He seemed to be watching a red paper kite, that was sailing beneath the blue sky. \"They see it now, both of them; the Colonel and Madame; they see that she\u0027s just slipping away from them, and they are ill. Ah but! the senseless--what you call it--distinctions--that the English set up!\" \"But what is the cause?\" asked Karl. Though it seemed to him that he could discern quite well without being answered. Aglaé threw her shrewd eyes into his. \"I think, sir, you might tell it for yourself, that. She has not been well since that fever. She was not well before the fever, since--since about the month of May.\" He drew in his lips. Aglaé, with native independence, continued to stare at him. \"Why don\u0027t you call and see her, sir?\" \"Because--well, I suppose you know, Aglaé. I should not be welcome to Colonel and Mrs. Cleeve.\" \"And the poor young lady, who never did harm to living soul, is to be let shrink down into her grave for the sake of English prejudice! I can see. I\u0027ve got my wits about me, and have seen it all along. My service to you, sir. Bon jour.\" The maid went on in a rage, her dainty cap nodding, her smart boots going down rather more noisily than was needful. Sir Karl passed on his way, thinking deeply. He walked about until the daylight was fading, and then strode back rapidly to his hotel, with the air of a man who is about to carry out some resolution that will not wait. He was. A resolution that had been floating in his mind before he\u0027 saw Lucy or encountered her maid. Colonel Cleeve was seated alone that evening in his dining-room in the Avenue d\u0027Antin, when a letter was delivered to him. For a few minutes he let it lie unheeded. The thoughts he was buried in were very sad ones--they ran on the decaying strength of his only daughter. It seemed to him and Mrs. Cleeve that unless some wonderful change--say a miracle, for instance--interposed, Lucy\u0027s life was not worth many weeks\u0027 purchase. They knew now--he and his wife--that the parting with Karl Andinnian had been too cruel for her. Arousing himself from his gloomy visions, the Colonel opened the note--which had been left by hand. Why here was a strange thing!--he started in surprise. Started when he saw the contents of the letter and the signature appended. Had the miracle come? It was one of the plain, candid, straightforward letters, so characteristic of Karl Andinnian. He said that he had chanced to see Miss Cleeve that day, that he had been shocked by her appearance; that he had happened to hear from Aglaé subsequently how very alarmingly she was failing. He went on to add with shrinking deprecation, every word of which told of the most sensitive refinement, that he feared the trouble of last May might have had something to do with it, and be still telling upon her. He then put a statement of his affairs, as to possessions and income, before Colonel Cleeve, and asked whether he might presume again to address Lucy now that he could offer a good settlement and make her Lady Andinnian. Three times over Colonel Cleeve read the note, pausing well to reflect between each time. Then he sent for his wife. \"He is of no family--and there\u0027s that dreadful slur upon it besides,\" remarked the Colonel, talking it over. \"But it may be the saving of Lucy\u0027s life.\" \"It is a good letter,\" said Mrs. Cleeve, reading it through her eye-glass. \"It\u0027s as good and proper a letter as any young man could write. All his instincts are honourable. Some men might have written to Lucy herself. Putting aside his lack of family and the other disrepute, we could not wish a better son-in-law than Sir Karl Andinnian.\" \"Yes,\" deliberated Mrs. Cleeve, after a pause. \"True. The disadvantages are great: but they seem little when balanced against the chance of restoring Lucy\u0027s life. She will be a baronet\u0027s wife; she will be sufficiently rich; and--I think--she will be intensely happy.\" \"Then I\u0027ll send for him,\" said Colonel Cleeve. The interview took place on the following morning. It was a peculiar one. Just as plainly open as Karl had been in his letter, so was the Colonel now. \"I think it may be the one chance for saving my child\u0027s life,\" he said; \"for there is no denying that she was very much attached to you, Sir Karl. Sitting alone after dinner last evening, I was telling myself that nothing short of a miracle could help her: the doctors say they can do nothing, the malady is on her mind--though for my part I think the chief ill is the weakness left by that ague-fever. Your letter came to interrupt my thoughts; and when I read it I wondered whether that was the miracle.\" \"If you will only give me Lucy, my whole life shall be devoted to her best comfort, sir,\" he said in a low tone. \"My happiness was wrecked equally with hers: but I am a man and therefore stronger to bear.\" \"Nothing would have induced me to give her to you had your brother lived,\" resumed the Colonel. \"If I am too plain in what I say I must beg you to excuse it: but it is well that we should understand each other thoroughly. Yourself I like; I always have liked you; but the disgrace reflected upon you was so great while your brother was living, a convict, that to see Lucy your wife then would I think have killed both me and Mrs. Cleeve. Take it at the best, it would have embittered our lives for ever.\" \"Had my unfortunate brother lived, I should never have attempted to ask for her, Colonel Cleeve.\" \"Right. I have observed that on most subjects your ideas coincide with my own. Rather than that--the disgrace to her and to us; and grievous though the affliction it would have brought to me and her mother--we would rather have laid our child to rest.\" The deep emotion with which Colonel Cleeve spoke--the generally self-contained man whose calmness almost bordered upon apathy--proved how true the words were, and how terribly the sense of disgrace would have told upon him. \"But your unhappy brother has paid the forfeit of his crimes by death,\" he continued, \"and it is to be hoped and expected that in time the remembrance of him and of what he did will die out of people\u0027s minds. Therefore we have resolved to trust to this hope, and give you Lucy. It will be better than to let her die.\" Sir Karl Andinnian drew in his slender lips. But that he had passed through a course of most bitter humiliation--and that, wherever it falls, seems for the time to wash out pride--he might have shown resentment at the last words. The Colonel saw he felt the sting: and he wished it had not been his province to inflict it. \"It was best to explain this, Sir Karl. Pardon me for its sound of harshness. And now that it is over and done with, let me say that never for a moment have I or Mrs. Cleeve blamed you. It was not your fault that your brother lost himself; neither could you have helped it: and we have both felt almost as sorry for you as though you had been a relative of our own. I beg that henceforth his name may never be mentioned between you and us: the past, so far as regards him, must be as though it had never been. You will observe this reticence?\" \"Unquestionably.\" \"The affair is settled then, Andinnian. Will you see Lucy?\" \"If I may,\" replied Karl, a bright smile succeeding to the sadness on his face. \"Does she know I am here?\" \"She knows nothing. Her mother thought it might be better that I should speak to you first. You can tell her all yourself. But mind you do it quietly, for she is very weak.\" Lucy happened to be alone in, the salon. She sat in a red velvet arm-chair as big as a canopy, looking at the pretty étrenne her mother had given her the previous day--a bracelet of links studded with turquoise and a drooping turquoise heart. A smile of gratitude parted her lips; though tears stood in her eyes, for she believed she should not live to wear it long. \"Lucy,\" said her father, looking in as he opened the door. \"I-have brought you a visitor who has called--Sir Karl Andinnian.\" Lucy rose in trembling astonishment; the morocco case, which had been on her lap, falling to the ground. She wore a dress of violet silk, and Aglaé had folded about her a white shawl--for chillness was present with her still. Karl advanced, and the Colonel shut them in together. He took both her hands in his, slipping the bracelet on to her attenuated wrist,--and quietly held them. The poor wan face and the hectic colour his presence had called up, had all his attention just then. \"I saw you in the Champs Elysées yesterday, Lucy. It pained me very much to see you so much changed.\" \"Did you see me? I was there with mamma. It is the fever I had in the summer that hangs about me and does not let me yet get strong.\" \"Is it nothing else, Lucy?\" The hectic deepened to crimson. The soft brown eyes drooped beneath the gaze of his. \"I fancied there might be another cause for it, Lucy, and I have ventured to say so to Colonel Cleeve. He agrees with me.\" \"You--you were not afraid to call here!\" she exclaimed, as if the fact were a subject of wonder. \"What I had to say to Colonel Cleeve I wrote by letter. After that, he invited me to call.\" Karl sat down on the red sofa opposite the chair, and put Lucy by him, his arm entwining her waist. \"I want you,\" he said, \"to tell me exactly what it is that keeps you from getting strong, Lucy.\" \"But I cannot tell you, for I don\u0027t know,\" she answered with a little sob. \"I wish I could get well, Karl--for poor papa and mamma\u0027s sake.\" \"Do you think I could do anything towards the restoration, Lucy?\" he continued, drawing her closer to his side. \"What could you do?\" \"Watch you, and tend you, and love you. And--and make you my wife.\" \"Don\u0027t jest, Karl,\" she said, whispering and trembling. \"You know it may not be.\" \"But if Colonel and Mrs. Cleeve say that it may be?\" The tone of his voice was redolent of anything but jesting: it was one of deep truthful emotion. Lucy looked questioningly up at him. \"Oh Karl, don\u0027t play with me! What do you mean?\" He caught the sweet face, and held it to his. His own hands were trembling, his race was pale as hers. But she could not mistake his grave earnestness. \"It means, my darling, that you are to be mine for ever. My wife. They are going to give you to me: your father brought me here that I might myself break it to you.\" A minute\u0027s doubting look; a slight shiver as if the joy were too great; and then with a sigh she let her head fall on his breast--its future resting-place. \"And what\u0027s this that you were looking at, Lucy?\" he asked after a while, turning the pretty bracelet round and round her wrist. \"Mamma bought it me yesterday for my New Year\u0027s étrenne. I was thinking--before you came--that I might not live to wear it.\" \"I was thinking yesterday, Lucy, as I walked along the Boulevards, that I would give a great deal to have some one to buy étrennes for. It is not too late, is it? Meanwhile----\" Breaking off his sentence, he took a very rare ring from his finger, one of the most brilliant of opals encompassed by diamonds. She had never seen him wear it before. \"Oh, how very beautiful!\" she exclaimed, as it flashed in a gleam of reflected sunlight. \"I do not give it you, Lucy,\" he said, putting it upon her finger. \"I lend it you until I can find another fit to replace it. That may be in a day, or so. This ring was my father\u0027s: made a present of to him by an Eastern Sultan, to whom he was able to render an essential service. At my father\u0027s death it came to my brother: and--later--to me.\" Karl\u0027s voice dropped as he was concluding. Lucy Cleeve felt for him; she knew what he must feel at the allusion. She glided her hand into his, unsought. \"So until then this ring shall be the earnest of our betrothal, Lucy. You will take care of it: and of my love.\" The ring was the same that had been seen on Sir Adam\u0027s finger at the trial. On that same day, after his condemnation, he had taken it off, and caused it to be conveyed to Karl--his, from henceforth. But Karl had never put it on his own finger until after his brother\u0027s death.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2701/74234.html","bookId":1457,"book":{"id":1457,"title":"Within the Maze","description":"简介： The house was ugly and old-fashioned, with some added modern improvements, and was surrounded by a really beautiful garden.
