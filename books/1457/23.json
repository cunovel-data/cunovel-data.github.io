{"id":32512,"no":23,"title":"VOL II CHAPTER I. The Maze invaded.","content":"The previous night\u0027s black cloud had culminated in a thunder-storm, and the morning air felt fresh and cool; but the blue sky was clear, the sun as bright as ever. Lucy came down with sad eyes and a pale face. Her night had been one of mental pain. She was wondering how much longer she could keep up this mask of cheerfulness--which she would especially have to wear that day; and she knew that she could not have done it at all, then or at any other time, but for the very present help of God. Karl, waiting in the breakfast-room, turned to shake hands with her. But for their being alone, he would not have ventured on this eminently suggestive action. \"How are you to-day, Lucy?\" \"Oh, quite well, thank you. Did you hear the storm?\" \"Yes. It has cleared away some of the sultry heat. We shall have a lovely day.\" The Lloyds were expected from Basham. When at the flower-show the previous day, Lucy had remarked that some of the hot-house plants were not as fine as those at Foxwood: upon that, the General and one of his daughters had simultaneously expressed a wish to see those at Foxwood. Lucy at once gave the invitation; and it was arranged that they should spend the next day at the Court. She had told her husband of this while Captain Lamprey was present; but it had not been alluded to afterwards. She spoke again now, while she and Karl were waiting breakfast for Miss Blake, who was at Matins at St. Jerome\u0027s. \"I could not do less than ask them,\" she observed. \"I hope you are not vexed.\" \"You did quite right, Lucy,\" he cheerfully answered. \"I shall be glad to see them.\" \"I don\u0027t know how many will come. Perhaps all; except Mrs. Lloyd, who never goes out anywhere. I hope Theresa will give up St. Jerome\u0027s for the rest of the day, and stay at home to help me entertain them.\" Karl smiled. \"To make sure of that you should invite Mr. Cattacomb.\" \"But you would not like that, would you?\" \"No. I was only joking, Lucy. Here she is.\" The Lloyds had said they would come early, and Karl strolled out to meet the eleven o\u0027clock train, leaving his wife decorating her drawing-room with flowers. Unhappy though Lucy was, she was proud of her home, and pleased that it should find admiration in the eyes of the world. As Karl was passing Clematis Cottage, he saw Mr. Smith seated at the open window, leisurely enjoying the freshened air, and smoking a cigar. Karl had been wanting to take a close, observant view of him; and he turned in on the spur of the moment. The asking for something which he really required afforded an excuse. Mr. Smith rose up to receive him graciously, and threw his half-smoked cigar out at the window. \"I think you have the plan of the out-lying lands of the estate, Mr. Smith, where the new cottages are to be built? Will you spare it to me in the course of the day? I will send Hewitt for it.\" \"Certainly, Sir Karl; it is at your service. Won\u0027t you take a seat? The bit of a breeze at this open window is quite refreshing.\" Karl sat down. Mr. Smith\u0027s green glasses lay on the table, and he could enjoy as clear a view of him as he pleased. The agent talked away, all unconscious no doubt that notes were being taken of his face and form. \"It is his own hair,\" mentally spoke Karl. \"\u0027Very dark brown,\u0027 they said; \u0027nearly black.\u0027 Just so. At the time of the escape Salter had neither whiskers nor beard nor moustache: the probability being, they thought, that he had now a full crop of all. Just so, again. Eyebrows: thick and arched, Grimley said: these are not thick; nor, what I should call, arched: perhaps there may be some way of manipulating eyebrows, and these have undergone the process. Eyes brown: yes. Face fresh and pleasant: yes. Voice and manners free and genial: yes. Age?--there I can\u0027t make the two ends meet. I am sure this man\u0027s forty. Is it Salter, or is it not?\" finally summed up Karl. \"I don\u0027t know, I think it is: but I don\u0027t know.\" \"Truefit the farmer spoke to me yesterday, Sir Karl,\" broke in Mr. Smith on his musings. \"He was asking whether you and Lady Andinnian viewed this new farce on his grounds with approbation. That\u0027s what he called it--farce. Meaning St. Jerome\u0027s.\" \"I suppose he does not like it,\" observed Karl. \"I fancy he does not really care about it himself, one way or the other, Sir Karl; in fact, he signified as much. But it seems his better-half, Mrs. Truefit, has taken a prejudice against it: calling the ceremonies \u0027goings-on,\u0027 and \u0027rubbish,\u0027 and \u0027scandal,\u0027 and all sorts of depreciating things. It is a pity Mr. Cattacomb can\u0027t confine himself to tolerable common-sense. The idea of their hanging that bell outside over the door, and pulling it perpetually!\" \"Yes,\" said Karl. \"So much nonsense takes all solemnity away.\" \"They are going to dress Tom Pepp in a white garment now, while he rings it, with a red cross down the back. It\u0027s that, I fancy, that has put up Mrs. Truefit. I told the farmer that I believed Sir Karl and Lady Andinnian did not favour the place: at least, that I had never seen them attend it.\" \"And you never will,\" returned Karl, as he rose. There was nothing to stay for; his observations were taken, and he departed, having to walk quickly to be in time at the station. Had he been free in mind the matters connected with St. Jerome\u0027s might have vexed him more than they did: but all annoyances were lost sight of in his one great care. The train came in, and the party arrived by it; six of them. Captain Lloyd, who was at home on leave; two Miss Lloyds; a married sister and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Panton, at present staying on a visit; and the General. Karl had expressed pleasure at his wife\u0027s invitation; perhaps had felt it; but he could not foresee the unlucky contretemps that the visit was to bring forth. To his unbounded astonishment, his inward confusion, no sooner had his guests entered Foxwood Court, than they expressed a wish to see the place called the Maze, and requested Sir Karl to conduct them to it. \"I was telling Panton about the Maze last night--talking of the Court and its surroundings,\" observed the General. \"Panton does not believe it possible that one could lose oneself in any maze whatever: so I promised him he should have a try at it. You will afford us the opportunity of seeing it, Sir Karl.\" \"I--I am not sure,\" stammered Karl, utterly taken aback, while his wife\u0027s face flushed a burning red. \"I hardly think it is in my power, General. The lady who inhabits it desires to keep herself so very quiet, that I should not feel justified in intruding upon her. She is not in strong health, I believe.\" \"But we would not think of disturbing the lady,\" called out all the voices together. \"We only wish to see the maze of trees, Sir Karl: not the dwelling-house. What\u0027s her name?\" \"Grey.\" \"Well, we shall not hurt her. Does she live by herself?\" \"While her husband is abroad. I am sure she will not choose to be intruded upon.\" Sir Karl might as well have talked to the winds. All opposed him. Of course there was no suspicion that he had any personal objection; only that he wished to respect the scruples of his lady-tenant. At length, the General declared he would go over to Mrs. Grey, ask to see her, and personally prefer the request. Poor Karl was at his wits\u0027 end. He saw that he should not be able to stem the storm--for he dared not be resolute in the denial, so fearful was he always of arousing any suspicion of there being a mystery in the place--and he was fain to yield. He would take them over, he said; but not before he had sent a note to say that they were coming. This he insisted on; it would be but common politeness, he urged; and they all agreed with him. Hastily writing a few words to Mrs. Grey in his own room, he called Hewitt to take the note over, and gave him at the same time a private message to deliver to Ann Hopley. Of course Karl\u0027s object was to warn his brother to keep out of sight--and Mrs. Grey too. Hewitt looked more scared than his master. \"To think of their wanting to go over there!\" he exclaimed in a low tone of covert fear. \"It can\u0027t be helped, Hewitt. Go.\" A few minutes, and Hewitt came back with a message: which he delivered to his master in public. Mrs. Grey\u0027s compliments to Sir Karl Andinnian, and he was at liberty to bring his friends within her gates if he pleased. So they all started; Lucy with them. Lucy with them! The ladies had assumed it to be so much a matter of course that their hostess should accompany them, that Lucy, timid in her self-consciousness, saw not her way clear to any plea of excuse. And it might be that, down deep in her woman\u0027s frail heart, there was a hankering longing to see the inside of that place which contained her rival. In the midst of her indecision she glanced at Karl and hesitated. But he saw not the look or the hesitation: for all the sign he gave out, she was as welcome to go to the place as these guests were. It is true that Miss Blake fixed her eyes upon her, and Lucy coloured under it; but perhaps the very fact only served to speed her on the way. The party started, passing out at the grand gates of Foxwood. Between that spot and the Maze, short though it was, they encountered Mr. Cattacomb. Miss Blake took upon herself to introduce him, and to ask him to accompany them, saying they were going to see that renowned show-place, the Maze. \"I did not know we had a show-place in the neighbourhood,\" drawled Mr. Cattacomb in his affectation. \"Neither have we,\" curtly rejoined Sir Karl, who would willingly have pitched Mr. Cattacomb over a mile elsewhere, but did not see an excuse for doing it. \"The Maze was never constituted a show-place yet, Miss Blake. I feel anything but comfortable at intruding there to-day, I assure you. Between my wish to gratify my friends, and my fear that it may be objectionable to the occupant of the Maze, I am in a blissful state of uncertainty,\" he added in a laughing kind of way, for the general benefit, fearing he might have spoken too pointedly and shown that he was really ill at ease. \"Sir Karl is ultra-sensitive,\" remarked Miss Blake--and a keen observer might have fancied there was some sarcasm in her tone. Karl rang the clanging bell--which might be heard far and wide; and Ann Hopley appeared, the key of the gate in her hand. She curtsied to the company as she admitted them. \"My mistress desires me to say, Sir Karl, that she hopes the gentle-people will see all they wish to see,\" cried the woman aloud, addressing the rest as much as she did Sir Karl. \"Mrs. Grey begs they will pardon her not appearing to welcome them, but she is not well to-day, and has to keep her room.\" \"Mrs. Grey is very kind,\" returned Sir Karl. \"We shall be cautious not to disturb her.\" They filed of their own accord into the maze. The old trees had not been so beset with gay tongues and laughter for many a day. One ran here, another there; they were like school boys and girls out for a holiday. Ann Hopley was about to follow them in when the clanging bell at the gate once more sounded, and she turned back to open it. Karl, never at rest--as who could be, knowing what he knew--looked after her while he talked with the rest; and he saw that the visitor was a policeman. His heart leaped into his mouth. Careless, in the moment\u0027s terror, of what might be thought of him, he broke off in the middle of a sentence to the General, and returned to the gate. His face was never very rosy, but every vestige of colour had forsaken it now. At a collected moment, he would have remembered that it was not in that way his brother would have been sought out--in the person of one solitary unarmed policeman--but fear scares probability away: as Rose had observed to him only the previous evening. Worse than all, the rest came flocking to the gate after him. \"Grey, ain\u0027t it?\" the policeman was saying to Ann Hopley. He had a paper in his hand and a pencil. \"Mrs. Grey,\" replied the servant. \"Mrs. Grey. There ain\u0027t no husband, I think?\" \"No.\" \"What\u0027s her Chris\u0027en name?\" A warning glance shot from Sir Karl\u0027s eyes, cautioning Ann Hopley to be on her guard. In truth it was not needed: the woman was caution itself, and had her ready wits at hand always. Karl saw what it was--some parish paper about to be left--and was recovering his inward equanimity. \"My mistress\u0027s Christian name? Mary.\" \"Mrs. Mary Grey,\" repeated the policeman, writing down the name on the paper. \"You\u0027ll please to give it her,\" he added, handing the paper in. \"It have got to be attended to.\" \"All tax-papers for Mrs. Grey must come to Foxwood Court,\" interposed, Sir Karl. \"Mrs. Grey takes the house furnished, and has nothing to do with the taxes.\" \"Beg pardon, Sir Karl, but that there\u0027s a voting-paper for a poor-law guardian,\" said the man, touching his hat. \"Oh, a voting-paper. Let it go in then,\" concluded Sir Karl. Mrs. Grey had no more to do with voting than she had with taxes; but Sir Karl let it pass. They were in the maze again; Ann Hopley having wound herself out of sight with the paper. Mr. Panton, the disbeliever, wound himself in and out of the trees and about the paths; but the voices always guided him back again. \"What a delightful place, Sir Karl!\" cried Mrs. Panton. \"Quite like a Fair Rosamond\u0027s Bower.\" Sir Karl laughed in reply. And--as Miss Blake noticed--there was not a trace of shame in his face. Lucy\u0027s colour, though, rose painfully. \"Let me see! it was a silken thread, was it not, that guided Queen Eleanor to her rival?\" continued Mrs. Panton. \"A cruel woman! I wonder whether she carried the bowl of poison in her hand?\" \"I wonder if the woman who destroyed the Queen\u0027s happiness, had any forewarning in her dreams of the fate in store for her?\" retorted Miss Blake, sharply--for she was thinking of another case, very near to her, that she judged to be analogous. \"For her punishment, it is to be hoped she had.\" \"Oh, but you know she was so lovely, poor thing! One can but pity her; can we, Lady Andinnian?\" \"I know nothing of it,\" spoke Lucy, in so chafed a tone that Karl turned to look at her. \"My opinion is, that the King should have taken half the bowl,\" said Miss Blake. \"That would have been even justice, Mrs. Panton.\" \"Well, well, judge it as you will, Fair Rosamond was very beautiful; and her fate was shocking. Of course the Queen was incensed; naturally: and the crime of poisoning in those days was, I suppose, looked upon as no crime at all. I have always wished the Queen had been lost in the maze and the poison spilt.\" \"Suppose we get lost in this one!\" It was Miss Lloyd who spoke, hurriedly and somewhat anxiously. It brought most of them around her. \"There is no danger here, is there? Sir Karl, you know the way out, I suppose?\" Karl evaded the question. \"If the worst come to the worst, we can set on and shout,\" he observed. \"But don\u0027t you know the clue? Is there not a clue? There must be!\" \"I see nothing of the kind,\" returned Karl. \"You forget that I am almost a stranger in the neighbourhood. We shall be all right. Don\u0027t fear.\" How Lucy despised him for his deceit! She felt that he must have the clue: why else need he let himself within the gate with his key--at least, with any purpose of finding his way further in after it? Miss Blake caught her eye; and Lucy turned away, sick at heart, from the compassion Miss Blake\u0027s glance wore. Sir Karl\u0027s \"Don\u0027t fear\" had been reassuring, and they dispersed about the Maze and lost themselves in it, very much as Miss Blake had once done. Mr. Cattacomb kept asking questions about the mistress of the Maze: why she lived there alone, where her husband was: for all of which Sir Karl could have struck him. He, Karl, would have contrived to keep them from the boundaries near the house: but they were as nine to one, and went whither they would: and, as had been Miss Blake\u0027s case, they got within view of it at last. \"What a pretty place!\" was the involuntary exclamation from more than one. It did look pretty: pretty and very cheerful. The windows of the house were open; the door of the porch was fastened back, as if to invite entrance. Not a sign or symptom existed of there being any cause for concealment. So far good, and Karl felt satisfied. But, as his eyes went ranging far and wide in their longed-for security, there was no doubt that he somewhere or other caught sight of his imprudent brother; for his face changed to an ashy paleness, and he groaned in spirit. \"Adam is surely mad,\" was his mental cry. Ann Hopley, who had probably been waiting about, stepped up at this moment, and asked with much civility if they would like to walk indoors and rest. Sir Karl, looking at his friends, as if for acquiescence in his denial, declined. \"We have no right to intrude,\" he whispered: and the General said so too. \"This might really do for a Rosamond\u0027s Bower!\" cried Mrs. Panton. \"It is a sweetly pretty place.\" The lawn was level as a bowling-green; the flowers and shrubs surrounding it were well-kept, fragrant, and blooming. Mounted on a ladder, nailing some branches against a wall that probably belonged to a tool-house, was the toothless old gardener, his knees swollen and bent, his white smock frock rolled up around him. \"That\u0027s the gardener at his work, I suppose?\" observed the General, whose eyes were dim. \"Yes, that\u0027s Hopley,\" said Karl. \"What d\u0027ye call his name; Sir Karl?\" \"Hopley. He is the woman\u0027s husband.\" \"I had a servant once of that name when I was quartered at Malta. A good servant he was, too.\" \"That man yonder looks ill,\" remarked Mrs. Panton. \"I fancy he is subject to rheumatism,\" said Sir Karl. \"How is your husband?\" he enquired of Ann Hopley. \"Pretty middling, sir, thank you,\" she answered. \"He is getting in years you see, gentlefolks, and is not as strong as he was.\" \"Will you be so good as precede us through the Maze and let us out,\" said Karl to her. \"I think it is time we went,\" he added to the others: \"we have seen all there is to see.\" Ann Hopley, key in hand, went winding through the Maze, in and out of the numberless paths. It seemed to those following, her that they only went round and round--just as it had seemed to Miss Blake that former day; and it took some time to get through it. The Reverend Mr. Cattacomb called it \"a pilgrimage.\" She was crafty, that faithful woman. Just as she had led Miss Blake a needlessly roundabout way, so she led them now. Had she taken them direct through, who knew but they might have caught some inkling of the clue? While opening the gate, General Lloyd would have put half-a-crown into her hand. She would not take it. \"I\u0027d rather not, sir; I\u0027ve done nothing to merit it. Our mistress pays us both well. Thank you, sir, all the same.\" \"A good, respectable, honest servant, that,\" remarked the General, slipping the money into his pocket again. Crossing the road from the Maze, the party came right in view of Clematis Cottage and Mr. Smith, who was leaning over the gate of it and staring with all his might. He raised his hat to the ladies generally, and then accosted Sir Karl, saying he had taken the plan, asked for, to the Court. \"Thank you,\" replied Karl. \"Who is that man?\" cried Captain Lloyd with some energy as they went on. \"I am sure I know him.\" \"His name\u0027s Smith,\" replied Karl. \"He is a sort of agent on my estate.\" \"Smith--Smith! I don\u0027t recollect the name. His face is quite familiar to me, though. Where can I have seen it?\" Karl longed in his heart to ask whether the face had ever belonged to the name of Salter; but he did not dare. There had been a peculiar expression in Mr. Smith\u0027s eyes as he spoke to him just now, which Karl had read rightly--he was sure Smith wanted to speak to him privately. So, after the rest had entered the home gates, he turned back. The agent had not stirred from his place. \"What have those people been doing there, Sir Karl?\" he asked, with a peremptory action of his hand towards the Maze. Karl explained. He did not dare do otherwise. Explained in full. \"Curious fools!\" cried the man angrily. \"Well, no harm seems to have been done, sir. Seeing you all come out of the gate, I could not believe my eyes, or imagine what was up.\" \"I fancied you wished to speak to me, Mr. Smith.\" \"And so I do, Sir Karl. The letters were late this morning--did you know it? They\u0027ve only just been delivered. Some accident, I suppose.\" \"I only know that none came to Foxwood Court this morning.\" \"Just so. Well, Sir Karl, I\u0027ve had one; ten minutes ago. I wrote to make inquiries about that paragraph, in the newspaper, and this letter was the answer to mine. It is as I thought. There\u0027s nothing known or suspected at all at headquarters; neither at Scotland Yard nor Portland Island. It was the work of the penny-a-liner, hang him!----just an invention, and nothing else.\" \"To whom did you write?\" \"Well, that\u0027s my business, and I cannot tell you. But you may rely upon what I say, Sir Karl, and set your mind at rest. I thought you\u0027d like to know this, sir, as, soon as possible.\" \"Thank you,\" replied Karl. He went back to his guests, his brain busy. Was this true, that Smith said? Who then was Smith that he could get this information? Or, was it that Smith was saying it for a purpose?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2701/74249.html","bookId":1457,"book":{"id":1457,"title":"Within the Maze","description":"简介： The house was ugly and old-fashioned, with some added modern improvements, and was surrounded by a really beautiful garden.
