{"id":32522,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XI. Mrs. Chaffen disturbed.","content":"We have now to return to Mr. Strange. That eminent detective was, to tell the truth, somewhat puzzled by his interview with Sir Karl Andinnian, held in the road; thrown, so to say, slightly on his beam ends. The earnest assurances of Sir Karl--that the individual he had been suspecting was the agent Smith, and that there was not, and could not be, any gentleman residing at the Maze--had made their due impression, for he saw that Sir Karl was a man whose word might be trusted. At the same time he detected, or thought he detected, an undue eagerness on Sir Karl\u0027s part to impress this upon him; an eagerness which the matter itself did not justify, unless Sir Karl had a private and personal motive for it. Musing on this, Mr. Strange had continued to walk about that evening instead of going on to his lodgings; and when Miss Blake surprised him underneath the trees at the Maze gate--or, rather, surprised herself by finding him there--he had not sought the spot to watch the gate, but as a shelter of seclusion while he thought. The stealthy entrance of Sir Karl Andinnian with a key taken from his pocket, and the whispered communication from Miss Blake, threw altogether another light upon the matter, and served to show what Sir Karl\u0027s personal motive might be. According to that lady\u0027s hints, Sir Karl was in the habit of stealing into the Maze, and that it was no one but Sir Karl himself who had been seen by Nurse Chaffen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Detective Strange could not conceal from his acute brain that, if this were true, his own case was almost as good as disposed of, and he might prepare to go back to town. Salter, the prey he was patiently searching out, was at the Maze or nowhere--for Mr. Strange had turned the rest of the locality inside out, and knew that it contained no trace of him. If the gentleman in the evening dress, seen by Nurse Chaffen, was Sir Karl Andinnian, it could not have been Philip Salter: and, as his sole motive for suspecting the Maze was that worthy woman\u0027s account of him she had seen, why the grounds of suspicion seemed slipping from under him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He thought it out well that night. Well and thoroughly. The tale was certainly likely and plausible. Sir Karl Andinnian did not appear to be one who would embark on this kind of private expedition; but, as the detective said to himself, one could not answer for one\u0027s own brother. Put it down as being Sir Karl that the woman saw, why then the mystery of her not having seen him again was at an end: for while she was there Sir Karl would not be likely to go to the Maze and show himself a second time. \\n\\n \\n\\n The more Mr. Strange thought it out, the further reason he found for suspecting that this must be the true state of the case. It did not please him. Clear the Maze of all suspicion as to Salter, and it would become evident that they had been misled, and that so much valuable time had been wasted. He should have to go back to Scotland Yard and report the failure. Considering that he had latterly been furnishing reports of the prey being found and as good as in his hands, the prospect was mortifying. This would be the second consecutive case in which he had signally failed. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it was by no means Mr. Strange\u0027s intention to take the failure for granted. He was too wary a detective to do that without seeking for proof, and he had not done with Foxwood yet. The first person he must see was Mrs. Chaffen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Somewhat weary with his night reflections and not feeling quite so refreshed as he ought, for the thing had kept him awake till morning, Mr. Strange sat down to his breakfast languidly. Watchful Mrs. Jinks, who patronized her easy lodger and was allowed to visit his tea, and sugar, and butter, and cheese with impunity, observed this as she whipped off the cover from a dish of mushrooms that looked as though it might tempt an anchorite. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a headache this morning, Mr. Strange, sir. Is it bad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, very bad,\" said Mr. Strange, who did not forget to keep up his r?le of delicate health as occasion afforded opportunity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What things them headaches are!\" deplored Mrs. Jinks. \"Nobody knows whence they come nor how to drive \u0027em away. Betsey Chaffen was nursing a patient in the spring, who\u0027d had bilious fever and rheumatis combined; and to hear what she said about that poor dear old gentleman\u0027s head----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the way, how is Mrs. Chaffen?\" interrupted Mr. Strange, with scant ceremony, and no regard to the old gentleman\u0027s head. \"I have not seen her lately.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She was here a day or two ago, sir; down in my kitchen. As to how she is, she\u0027s as strong as need be: which it\u0027s thanks to you for inquiring. She never has nothing the matter with her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she out nursing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not now. She expects to be called out soon, and is waiting at home for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is her home?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down Foxglove Lane, sir, turning off by Mr. Sumnor\u0027s church. Bull, the stonemason, lives in the end house there, and she have lodged with \u0027em for years. Bull tells her in joke sometimes that some of \u0027em ought to be took ill, with such a nurse as her in the house. Which they never are, for it\u0027s as healthy a spot as any in Foxwood.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Strange had a knack of politely putting an end to his landlady\u0027s gossip when he pleased, and of sending her away. He did so now: and the widow transferred herself and her attentions to Mr. Cattacomb\u0027s parlour. \\n\\n \\n\\n People must hold spring and autumn cleanings, or where would their carpets and curtains bel Mrs. Chaffen, though occupying but one humble room (with a choice piece of furniture in it that was called a \"bureau\" by day, and was a bed by night) was not exempt from the general sanitary obligations. Mrs. Bull considered that she instituted these periodical bouts of scrubbing oftener than there was occasion for: but Betsey Chaffen liked to take care of her furniture--which was her own--and was moreover a cleanly woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n On this self-same morning she was in the thick of it: her gown turned up about her waist, her hands and arms bare to the elbow, plunged into a bucket of soapsuds, herself on her knees, and the furniture all heaped together on the top of the shut-up bureau in the corner, when one of the young Bulls came in with the astounding news that a gentleman was asking for her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Goodness bless me!\" cried the poor woman, turning cold all over, \"it can\u0027t be that I\u0027m fetched out, can it, Sam?--and me just in the middle of all this mess!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He said, was Mrs. Chaffen at home, and could he see her,\" replied Sam. \"He\u0027s a waiting outside:\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chaffen sat back on her heels, one hand resting on the bucket, the other grasping the wet scrubbing-brush, and her face the very picture of consternation as she stared at the boy. She had believed herself free for a full week to come. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it Mr. Henley himself, Sam?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t Mr. Henley at all,\" said Sam. \"It\u0027s the gentleman what\u0027s staying at Mrs. Jinks\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the plague brings him here this morning of all others, when I\u0027ve got the floor in a sop and not a chair to ask him to set down upon!\" cried the woman, relieved of her great fear, but vexed nevertheless to be interrupted in her work, and believing the intruder to be Mr. Cattacomb, come on one of his pastoral visits: for that excellent divine made no scruple, in his zeal, of looking in occasionally on Mr. Sumnor\u0027s flock as well as his own. \"Parsons be frightful bothers sometimes!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t the parson; it\u0027s the t\u0027other one?\" said Sam Bull. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chaffen rose from her knees, stepped gingerly across the wet floor, and took a peep through the window. There she saw Mr. Strange in the centre of a tribe of young Bulls, dividing among them a piece of lettered gingerbread. Sam, afraid of not coming in for his share of the letters, bolted out of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask the gentleman if he\u0027ll be pleased to step in, Sam, and to excuse the litter,\" she called after the boy. \"I don\u0027t mind him,\" she mentally added, seizing upon a mop to mop the wet off the floor, and then letting down her gown, \"and he must want something particular of me; but I\u0027d not have cared to stand Cattakin\u0027s preaching this busy morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Strange came in in his pleasant way, admiring everything, from the room to the bucket, and assuring her he rather preferred wet floors to dry ones. While she was reaching him a chair and dusting it with her damp apron, he held out his hand, pointing to where the cuts had been. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, Mrs. Chaffen. I have been thinking of coming to you this day or two past, but fancied I might see you in Paradise Row, for I\u0027d rather have your opinion than a doctor\u0027s at any time. The hand has healed, you see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir; it looks beautiful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I am not sure that it has healed properly, though it may look \u0027beautiful,\u0027\" he rejoined. \"Feel this middle cut. Here; just on the seam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Chaffen rubbed her fingers on the same check apron, and then passed them gently over the place he spoke of. \"What do you feel?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, sir, it feels a little hard, and there seems to be a kind of knot,\" she said, still examining the place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Precisely so. There\u0027s a stiffness about it that I don\u0027t altogether like, and now and then it has a kind of a prickly sensation. What I have been fancying is, that a bit of glass may possibly be in it still.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mrs. Chaffen did not think so. In her professional capacity she talked nearly as learnedly as a doctor could have talked, though not using quite the same words. Her opinion was that if glass had remained in the hand it would not have healed: she believed that Mr. Strange had only to let it alone and have a little patience, and the symptoms he spoke of would go away. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is not at all improbable that this opinion was Mr. Strange\u0027s own; but he thanked her and said he would abide by her advice, and gave her a little more gentle flattery. Then he sat down in the chair she had dusted, as if he meant to remain for the day, in spite of the disorder of affairs and the damp floor, and entered on a course of indiscriminate gossip. Mrs. Chaffen liked to get on quickly with her work, but she liked gossip better; no matter how busy she might be, a dish of that never came amiss; and she put her back against another chair and folded her bare arms in her apron, and gossiped back again. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a smooth and natural manner, apparently without intent, the conversation presently turned upon the gentleman (or ghost) Mrs. Chaffen had seen at the Maze. It was a theme she had not tired of yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you come to talk of that,\" cried the detective, \"do you know what idea has occurred to me upon the point, Mrs. Chaffen? I think the gentleman you saw may have been Sir Karl Andinnian.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nurse Chaffen, contrary to her usual habit, did not immediately reply, but seemed to fall into thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Was it Sir Karl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well now that\u0027s a odd thing!\" she broke forth at last. \"Miss Blake asked me the very same question, sir--was it Sir Karl Andinnian?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, did she. When?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When we had been talking of the thing in your rooms, sir--that time that I had been a dressing of your hand. In going down stairs, somebody pulled me, all mysterious like, into the Reverend Cattakin\u0027s parlour: I found it was Miss Blake, and she began asking me what the gentleman looked like and whether it was not Sir Karl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And was it Sir Karl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Being took by surprise in that way,\" went on Mrs. Chaffen, disregarding the question, \"I answered Miss Blake that I had not had enough time to notice the gentleman and could not say whether he was like Sir Karl or not. Not having reflected upon it then, I spoke promiscuous, you see sir, on the spur of the moment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And was it Sir Karl?\" repeated Mr. Strange. \"Now that you have had time to reflect upon it, is that the conclusion you come to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir; just the opposite. A minute or two afterwards, if I\u0027d only waited, I could have told Miss Blake that it was not Sir Karl. I couldn\u0027t say who it was, but \u0027twas not him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This assertion was so contrary to the theory Mr. Strange had been privately establishing that it took him somewhat by surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are you enabled to say surely it was not Sir Karl?\" he questioned, laughing lightly, as if the matter amused him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because, sir, the gentleman was taller than Sir Karl. And, when I came to think of it, I distinctly saw that he had short hair, either lightish or grayish: Sir Karl\u0027s hair is a beautiful wavy brown, and he wears it rather long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Twilight is very deceptive,\" remarked Mr. Strange. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt of that, sir: but there was enough light coming in through the passage windows for me to see what I have said. I am quite positive it was not Sir Karl Andinnian.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would you swear it was not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir, I\u0027d not swear it: swearing\u0027s a ticklish thing: but I am none the less sure. Mr. Strange, it was not Sir Karl for certain,\" she added impressively. \"The gentleman was taller than Sir Karl and had a bigger kind of figure, broader shoulders like, and it rather struck me at the time that he limped in his walk. That I couldn\u0027t hold to, however.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just the description of what Salter would most likely be now,\" mused the detective, his doubts veering about uncomfortably. \"He would have a limp, or something worse, after that escapade out of the railway carriage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if you are so sure about it, Mrs. Chaffen, I suppose it could not have been Sir Karl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can trust my sight, sir, and I am sure. What ever could have give rise to the thought that it was Sir Karl?\" continued she, after a moment\u0027s pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, you must know, Mrs. Chaffen, that Sir Karl Andinnian is the only man in Foxwood who is likely to put on evening dress as a rule. And being a neighbour of Mrs. Grey\u0027s and her landlord also, it was not so very improbable he should have called in, don\u0027t you see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus enlightened, Mrs. Chaffen no longer wondered how the surmise had arisen. She reiterated her assertion that it was not Sir Karl; and Mr. Strange, gliding into the important question of soda for cleaning boards, versus soap, presently took an affable leave. \\n\\n \\n\\n There he was, walking back again, his thoughts almost as uncertain as the wind. Was Miss Blake\u0027s theory right, or was this woman\u0027s? If the latter, and the man was in truth such as she described him, taller and broader than Sir Karl, why then he could, after all, have staked his life upon the Maze being Salter\u0027s place of concealment. What if both were right? It might be. Sir Karl might be paying these stealthy visits to Mrs. Grey, and yet be totally ignorant that any such person as Salter was at the Maze. They would hardly dare to tell him; and Salter would take care to conceal himself when Sir Karl was there. At any rate, he--Mr. Strange--must try and put the matter to rest with all speed, one way or the other. Perhaps, however, that resolution was more easy to make than to carry out. As a preliminary step he took a walk to the police station at Basham, and was seen in the street there by Sir Karl Andinnian. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2701/74259.html","bookId":1457,"book":{"id":1457,"title":"Within the Maze","description":"简介： The house was ugly and old-fashioned, with some added modern improvements, and was surrounded by a really beautiful garden.
