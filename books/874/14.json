THE “LIVELY STUNNERS.”","content":"After the first greeting between Frank Maynard and his friend Prescott, upon the former\u0027s return from Staffordshire, and when they had fairly sat down in Frank\u0027s room for a talk, Prescott said,— “Now, Frank, let me hear all about what you have been doing. Your letters were not long, and you seemed enjoying yourself down there, Frank. I suppose Teddy is just about the same as he used to be.” “Just the same,” Frank laughed; [22] “he pretends to assist his father in the business, but I fancy the material advantage, derived by Painter and Co. from Teddy\u0027s services, is slight indeed. He went round the manufactory with me, and I find that his knowledge upon the subject of china is absolutely nil. I question if he would know the difference between Dresden and Sèvres, or between Limoges and Etruscan; and I should imagine his ideas on the subject of accounts, are, if possible, even more vague. No, he is just what he used to be—a careless, warm-hearted Irishman, and the best fellow in the world.” “But Mr. Drake is not Irish, Frank?” “Not the least in the world. A particularly practical, long-headed, sensible Englishman. His Celtic blood all comes from his mother. She is as Irish in her way as he is in his, and so is his sister.” “Is Miss Drake pretty, Frank?” “Yes,” Frank said, “very pretty; an awfully jolly girl, Prescott, not the least bit of nonsense about her—downright and straightforward, you know.” Prescott glanced up. But he saw that Frank was too outspoken in his praise to be the least in love. “Tall or short, Frank?” “Tall,” Frank said; “a good deal like Teddy; fancy Teddy a pretty girl, and you\u0027ve got Sarah.” “And there was a cousin with an Irish name, [23] Frank, wasn\u0027t there? You mentioned her in your first letter, but you did not allude to her afterwards. What was she like?” Frank was longer in giving his answer this time. “Well,” he said, slowly, “Miss O\u0027Byrne would hardly be considered very pretty, at least I don\u0027t think most people would call her so. No, I should say not. She was rather short; and, yes, I should say, and plump.” Prescott glanced across again at Frank, and a little amused smile came across his face at the cautious way in which he had spoken. But Frank was looking thoughtfully into the fire, and did not notice it. “There were other young ladies staying in the house you said, Frank. Was there anything special about any of them?” “No,” Frank said, carelessly; “they were a very jolly lot of girls; I had great fun down there.” “Lots of dancing, and music, and so on, I suppose, Frank?” “No end,” Frank said. “Any of the girls sing well?” “Katie sang splendidly; one of the finest [24] voices I ever heard in my life,” Frank said, enthusiastically. “Katie?” Prescott repeated questioningly. “Miss OByrne,” Frank explained. “Ah,” Prescott said, with a smile, “the stout little cousin.” “Good heavens, Prescott,” Frank said, turning round with great indignation, “what are you talking about?—stout little—by Jove, what put such a ridiculous idea in your head?” “Why, my dear Frank, you said she was rather short and plump.” “Pooh, nonsense,” Frank said; “she is rather short, perhaps, but has a charming little figure; just a little plump; but—” and muttering the obnoxious word over to himself, he smoked away in short angry puffs. Prescott could hardly help laughing aloud at the success which attended his ruse. “So Miss O\u0027Byrne is not to be talked of lightly, eh, Frank?” “Oh, nonsense,” Frank said. [25] “Of course one doesn\u0027t like to hear a girl like Katie talked of as a stout little—but there, of course you couldn\u0027t tell.” “And do you ever mean to repeat your visit, Frank?” “Well, yes, Prescott, I expect I shall go down there again; at least I hope so.” “And may I ask, Frank, if you have any intention of bringing Miss O\u0027Byrne back with you?” Frank put his pipe down, and looked at Prescott, who was evidently greatly amused; then, after a moment\u0027s pause, he said,— “You have guessed it, Prescott, sure enough. If Katie will come, I will bring her up.” “Really, Frank?” “Really, old man. I should have told you sooner or later. I am quite in earnest. I will marry Katie O\u0027Byrne if she will have me.” “I am very glad, Frank, very glad indeed;” and Prescott shook his friend warmly by the hand. “I always hoped you would do it sooner or later, Frank. You are only leading an idle useless life, and a wife will be the making of you. Of course she is very nice, Frank.” “My dear fellow,” Frank said, quite inclined to be communicative now that the ice was [26]pan\u003e broken, “she is the most loveable girl in the world.” Prescott laughed. “But not pretty, eh, Frank?” “Well, Prescott, I suppose most men wouldn\u0027t call her pretty at first; I don\u0027t think I did; but I think her so now. Not pretty, perhaps, but loveable; that\u0027s the only word that expresses it, Prescott; just loveable, with the most trusting eyes you ever saw. She is full of fun, Katie, and has got a very decided will of her own. Not a bit of a muff, you know, Prescott.” “No, I don\u0027t think you would be likely to fall in love with a muff, Frank. Well, and what does the young lady think of you, Frank? Was it a very strong flirtation?” Frank laughed. [27] “No, Prescott, not a bit of it. It was perpetual war. I am afraid I was very hard on her, but I did like teazing her, and making her indignant. Katie has rather a will of her own, you see, and can hit very hard when she likes; and she was immensely angry at being made fun of. I do think, sometimes, she almost hated me. I don\u0027t think she has the least idea I care for her; but I don\u0027t know, Prescott, I hope that in the end I shall win her.” Prescott smiled at Frank\u0027s description of his love-making. “Well, Frank, and what do you propose doing with yourself this evening?” [28] “I hardly know, Prescott. I feel too restless to sit still, and a theatre would be just as bad. What with drives, and dinners, and parties, and a constant state of light skirmishing when I was with Katie, and an extreme amount of thought and restlessness when I was alone, I have been kept in a state of constant excitement for the last three weeks. I was always wondering whether anything would come of it; whether it was a mere case of strong flirtation, such as I have been engaged in fifty times before, or whether I was seriously in earnest. And then at last I arrived at the fixed and settled determination that of all the women I ever met, Katie was the one most certain to make me perfectly happy. Altogether I have been regularly worked up, and it would be quite impossible for me to sit still. I want something to let off the steam. A row would suit me admirably. It would be an immense satisfaction to hit out from the shoulder. Suppose we go to the ‘Stunners.’ There is sure to be some sparring going on; and if there\u0027s no one else, I can put on the gloves with Perkins. What do you say, Prescott?” “Anything you like, Frank, so that I am not called upon to bail you out.” So after dinner they went up to the “Lively Stunners.” The “Stunners” was a public-house, situated in one of the small streets lying above the top of the Haymarket. Not an aristocratic neighbourhood, indeed the reverse; but the “Stunners” did a good business, as even Perkins was ready to allow. Perkins was behind the bar in his shirt-sleeves, and was very busy indeed when the young men entered. “Ah, Mr. Maynard, I am glad to see you, sir.” “How are you, Perkins? Anything going on upstairs?” “Not much, sir. It\u0027s not the night for sparring. We\u0027ve got harmony to-night, sir.” [29] “I want a set-to with the gloves, Perkins. What do you say?” “Well, sir, I should be willing enough, but I am going out for a spree. Just the thing to suit you if you are in the humour.” “What is it, Perkins?” “Well, sir, you must keep it dark, or it wouldn\u0027t do me any good in my business; but the Slogger and I are going,”—and here he bent over the bar with an air of great mystery,—“we\u0027re going to a Chartist meeting to-night. The Slogger knows a fellow who is hot about it, and he\u0027s put him up to the pass-word. So we\u0027re going, and if you and Mr. Prescott are game, you can go with us. We can easily get up a row if we like, and it\u0027s hard if us four can\u0027t fight our way out of it.” “The very thing, Perkins; as you say, it\u0027s hard if we can\u0027t get up a row somehow. What do you say, Prescott?” “Anything you like, Frank. A black eye will not look strictly professional, but as I have no case on in court it won\u0027t much matter. I have not used my fists since that last town and gown row we were in together at Cambridge; and I have no objection to a row for once in a way.” [30] “Well, Mr. Maynard, we are not to start till half-past nine, it\u0027s no use getting there too early, so if you don\u0027t mind going upstairs for an hour, I will tell you when it is time to be off.” “If there\u0027s no sparring going on, Perkins, I think we\u0027ll go out for a stroll, and come back at the time you name. I can\u0027t stand the bad tobacco smoke, and the bad singing.” “Now, gentlemen, if you\u0027re ready,” Perkins said, when they returned, “I\u0027m with you.” They went into the bar-parlour, where the Slogger, a powerful man, with the unmistakeable look of a prize fighter, was awaiting them. “You are not thinking of going like that?” he asked. “Lor\u0027, they\u0027d never let you in, not if you\u0027d twenty pass-words, and if they did, they\u0027d pitch into us directly we were in the light. No; if you mean to go, you must go like working men.” [31] “Have you any clothes you could lend us, Perkins?” “Well, sir, I\u0027ve an old greatcoat which would cover you well enough, and I dare say I can rummage out something for Mr. Prescott. As for hats, your best way is to send out and buy a couple of cheap billycocks. You can pull them down over your eyes. I think that with that, and if you take off your collars, and put a black handkerchief or a bird\u0027s eye round your necks, you will pass well enough.” The transformation was soon effected, and the two young men could not help laughing at each other\u0027s altered appearance. “You\u0027ll pass very well for a bricklayer out of employ, Frank.” “Well, Prescott,” Frank retorted, “I could swear to you as a disreputable-looking tailor anywhere.” A cab was at the door, and the party were soon off. “Now,” Perkins said, “if there is a shindy, we must all keep together, and then we shall be as right as ninepence, whatever comes of it. I\u0027d back the Slogger and you and I, Mr. Maynard, to clear the roughs out of any room in London in about five minutes. Mr. Prescott\u0027s very handy with the gloves, but he hasn\u0027t weight, and in a close fight weight tells.” “Where is the place, Perkins?” “In the New Cut, sir. It\u0027s a penny gaff at ordinary times.” Arrived at the New Cut, they discharged the [32] cab, and went on foot through the busy crowd with which that locality is always filled of a Saturday evening. Hundreds of men were standing about, their week\u0027s work finished, smoking and talking together. The women were busy shopping, and were engaged in examining the various goods before purchasing, and in chaffering with the shopmen and costermongers. The pleasure of shopping is by no means a monopoly of the rich, the poor enjoy it to at least an equal extent; and no lady can more carefully examine the texture of the silk dress which the shopman temptingly holds out before her, or turn over one article after another before making her selection, than does her poorer sister scrutinise the markings and colour of a piece of bacon, or turn over the heaps of cauliflowers and cabbages upon a costermonger\u0027s cart. Great is the noise. The touts at the second-hand furniture and Jew clothing shops, the butchers, and the itinerant vendors, vie with each other in their efforts to obtain customers. Half-price has just begun at the Victoria Theatre, which stands large and black at the corner of the New Cut, and numbers are flocking in to see the [33] tragedy of “The Hangman\u0027s Stepdaughter; or the Murdered Mother of the Blind Alley.” Views of this drama, of thrilling interest and in bright colours, are placed beside the doors, and, illuminated by the bright gaslight, exhibit scenes of bloodshed and murder, highly enticing to the frequenters of the threepenny gallery. A few policemen are scattered among the crowd, but their services are seldom required, except when some drunken man insists upon fighting everyone, and, refusing all persuasion to return home, has to be taken to the station-house, in spite of his struggles and shouts, by two policemen. In the discharge of this duty, although undertaken solely for the protection of the public, the police are greeted with much jeering and hooting on the part of that ungrateful body. And then all goes on quietly for a time. The gaslights shine brightly out from the gin-palaces, and great business is in course of being there carried on. Numbers go in and out, and the glass-doors are ever on the swing. Through these doors glimpses can be caught of crowds of men and women standing at the bar drinking, and waiting to be served; while through the open [34] windows of the room above sounds of singing and of violent thumping of pewter pots and glasses upon the table come out. Through all this the four companions slowly made their way, and presently stopped at the door of one of those establishments popularly known as a penny gaff,—theatres at which a suicide, three murders, four combats, two comic songs, and a ballet, are condensed into the space of a quarter of an hour, and are to be heard for the charge of a penny; dens in which a perspiring audience inhale a pestilential atmosphere and vicious ideas together, and which the strong arm of the legislature should either reform or sweep away altogether. At present the establishment was apparently closed. The appalling pictures no longer stood before the doors. The illumination which usually blazed upon it was extinguished. No sound of music or laughter came through into the street. The doors were closed, and the whole place seemed deserted. Now and then, however, a man went up, knocked, and after a short parley was admitted, and then all was quiet again. At this door the party knocked. It was partially opened, and a voice said,— [35] “What do you want?” “Universal suffrage,” the Slogger answered. The door opened a little wider, and they all entered. They found themselves in perfect darkness, but the man who had let them in turned on the light of a bull\u0027s-eye lantern. “You are late, mates,” he said, leading the way along the passage. Opening a door, he admitted them into the main apartment, a sort of covered room or theatre. At one end was a raised stage, with the usual front and drop scene. The latter was now raised, however, and four or five chairs and a table were on the stage, and some ten or a dozen men were standing or sitting there. The aspect of the place was tawdry and dirty beyond description. The walls, originally white and decorated with flower wreaths, were now black with smoke and filth. What the ornamentation of the ceiling had once been, it was impossible to say. The place was lighted by two gas chandeliers, without glasses, and by a row of footlights in front of the stage. The room was full of men, who were mostly smoking short pipes, and the fog of tobacco smoke made it seem dingier and darker than it [36] really was, while the close, noxious atmosphere, and the entire absence of any ventilation whatever, rendered it difficult for any one unaccustomed to such noxious atmosphere to breathe at all. The new comers took their stand close to the door where they entered, and the seats having been removed and everyone standing, their coming was altogether unnoticed by anyone. “I say, Prescott, the air here is poisonous; it makes me feel quite faint.” “So it does me, Frank. We\u0027d better light our pipes; we shan\u0027t feel it so much.” They accordingly followed the example of all around them, and began to smoke, but even then they found the atmosphere almost overpowering. “We can\u0027t stand this long, Prescott. We\u0027ll just listen to a speech or two, and then we will have some fun.” The meeting, they soon found, was principally held for the object of informing the people of the arrangements which had been made for the great meeting to take place in a few days. All in the hall were evidently in their way leaders, and the speakers urged them to bring up their forces to the appointed place, to keep them well in hand, [37] and to be prepared in case of resistance, for barricade fighting. Each was requested to notice particularly the addresses of the gunsmiths\u0027 shops, and even of second-hand dealers where a few firearms might be exhibited in the windows, and to tell off men upon whom they could rely to seize the arms. General instructions, too, were given as to forming barricades; and the noble example of the French was cited to them again and again. “This is rather a serious business, Frank.” “It\u0027s all talk, my dear fellow; an English mob has no idea of street fighting; a few hundred policemen would drive ten thousand of them.” The speaker now finished amid a low murmur of applause. The man who followed him was of a less practical turn, and simply strove to excite his hearers by a speech calling upon them to strike for liberty, and to cut off the chains in which they were bound by a pampered aristocracy. “Look out, Perkins, I\u0027m going to begin,” Frank said; and then, at the top of his voice, he shouted out, “That\u0027s a lie!” [38] An immense confusion at once took place in the hall. There were shouts of “A spy!”—“Turn him out!”—“Hang him!”—“Lock the doors!” But those nearest who turned to carry these threats into execution, hesitated a moment at the sight of the three powerful men who guarded the door, which Prescott, as previously agreed, had opened, to prevent the man in the passage locking it on the other side. The hesitation was momentary, and then a tremendous rush was made by the exasperated crowd. Those in front, however, as speedily recoiled, or were beaten back by the tremendous blows of Frank Maynard and the two prizefighters. The assault of the Slogger, however, was not in the first place directed against those who attacked him, but against a man who was standing in front of him, and who had evinced no intention of taking part in the fray. He was a tall man, dressed as a bricklayer, with large whiskers and black hair. Soon after he had entered, the Slogger had noticed with surprise that these whiskers were false, for the upper part of one of them, owing probably to the heat of the room, had become detached from his face. The [39] Slogger would not have thought much of this, as he supposed at first it was some one who had disguised himself, and come merely from curiosity, as he had himself, but something in the man\u0027s figure, and in his peculiar way of holding his head, reminded him of a man against whom he had a particular grudge, for having, only the week before, been the means of transporting the Slogger\u0027s brother. He determined immediately the fray began to find out if his suspicions were correct. Accordingly, the instant the rush was made, he commenced the assault, by striking the unsuspecting man in front of him a violent blow on the ear, which would have sent him to the ground had not he been kept on his feet by the crowd around him. His false whiskers, however, fell off, and the smoothly shaven cheeks were visible. “Ha! Mr. Barton,” the Slogger shouted, as he dealt tremendous blows right and left at the assailants who rushed at him, “it\u0027s my turn now. You shan\u0027t go out from here with a whole skin. A spy!—a spy!” he shouted; but the tumult was too great for his voice to be heard. For some little time the three men had easily [40] beaten off their assailants, but matters were momentarily becoming more serious. The men on the platform were breaking up the chairs and tables, while others tore down portions of the woodwork to form weapons. These now pressed forward through the crowd as they fell back in dismay from their formidable opponents. “I think it\u0027s about time to make a bolt, sir.” “All right, Perkins,—come along.” In the meantime, Prescott had had a quiet encounter of his own with the door-keeper—who had been signally worsted, and had run out into the street—and was now holding the door ready to close it as the others retreated. After a rush upon the assailants, in order to drive them back, and gain time for the man?uvre, the three men made a hasty retreat through the door, which Prescott instantly closed and locked behind them, and in another instant they were out in the New Cut. “Come the other way, sir,” Perkins said, “there\u0027s a cab-stand under the railway-arch, and if them fellows get out and find us, they\u0027d be as likely to knife us as not.” In another minute they were in the cab. [41] “That was a sharp fight, Perkins.” “And no mistake, sir. As good a turn-up as I\u0027ve had for a long time. There\u0027ll be some smartish black eyes in the morning.” “Do you think there is really going to be a row with these Chartists, Perkins?” “I don\u0027t think so, sir. They don\u0027t mind the bobbies, but they\u0027ll never stand against the red coats. I\u0027m going to-morrow to get sworn in as a special. I ain\u0027t going to have them coming in to the ‘Stunners’ to help themselves without pay. I don\u0027t know, and I don\u0027t care, a rap about the charter, and I don\u0027t believe one in fifty of them knows theirselves. What they want isn\u0027t the charter so much as their neighbour\u0027s goods. Well, they won\u0027t get my beer till some of \u0027em have gone down. They\u0027ll find that they have to pay for it one way or the other. Here we are, sir, and I ain\u0027t sorry, for I don\u0027t know that I was ever so dry in my life.” “So am I, Perkins; the heat and stench in that place was tremendous. The fighting, too, was warm while it lasted. I don\u0027t think any of us got hit.” “Hit!” said Perkins, contemptuously; “no, [42] nor we shouldn\u0027t have been if we had stopped there all night. Not as long as we could have kept them at arm\u0027s length. The worst of that sort of row is, that the fellows who are behind always want to get close, and they push the chaps in front on so that at last one gets jammed up into a heap, and can\u0027t use one\u0027s arms. No, I think we just stopped long enough. The leg of a table is a nasty sort of thing to come down on your guard. Now then, sir, what\u0027s your liquor?”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3160/86737.html","bookId":874,"book":{"id":874,"title":"All But Lost","description":"简介： It is near the end of the Lent term at Cambridge, a raw, damp day.
