{"id":32572,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"JUBAL AND THE MAN FROM MARS strolled slowly into the living room withthe big stereo tank. Apparently the entire Nest was gathered, watching it. Itshowed a dense and turbulent crowd, somewhat restrained by policemen. 　　Mike glanced at it and looked serenely happy. .They come. Now is thefullness.“ The sense of ecstatic expectancy Jubal had felt growing ever sincehis arrival swelled greatly, but no one moved. 　　.It’s a mighty big tip, sweetheart,“ Jill agreed. 　　.And ready to turn,“ added Patty. 　　.I’d better dress for it,“ Mike commented. .Have I got any clothes aroundthis dump? Patty?“.Right away, Michael.“Jubal said, .Son, that mob looks pretty ugly to me. Are you sure this is anytime to tackle them?“.Oh, sure,“ said Mike. .They’ve come to see me ... so now I go down to meetthem.“ He paused while some clothing got out of the way of his face; he wasbeing dressed at break-neck speed with the unnecessary help of severalwomen-unnecessary as each garment seemed to know where to go and howto drape itself. .This job has its obligations as well as its privileges-the starhas to show up for the show . . * grok me? The marks expect it.“Duke said, .Mike knows what he’s doing, Boss.“.Well ... I don’t trust mobs.“.That crowd is mostly curiosity seekers, they always are. Oh, there are someFosterites and some others with grudges-but Mike can handle any crowd. 　　You’ll see. Right, Mike?“.Keerect, Cannibal. Pull in a tip, then give .em a show. Where’s my hat? 　　Can’t walk in the noonday sun without a hat.“ An expensive Panama with asporty colored band glided out and settled itself on his head; he cocked itjauntily. .There! Do I look all right?“ He was dressed in his usual outerservicesmufti, a smartly tailored, sharply creased, white business suit, shoesto match, snowy shirt, and luxurious dazzling scarf. 　　Ben said, .All you lack is a brief case.“.You grok I need one? Patty, do we have one?“Jill stepped up to him. .Ben was kidding, dear. You look just perfect.“ Shestraightened his tie and kissed him-and Jubal felt kissed. .Go talk to them.“.Yup. Time to turn the tip. Anne? Duke?“.Ready, Mike.“ Anne was wearing her floor-length Fair Witness, cloak,wrapping her in dignity; Duke was just the opposite, being sloppily dressed,with a lighted cigarette dangling from his face, an old hat on the back of hishead with a card marked .PRESS“ stuck in its band, and himself hung aboutwith cameras and kit. 　　They headed for the door to the foyer common to the four penthouse suites. 　　Only Jubal followed; all the others, thirty and more, stayed around the stereotank. Mike paused at the door. There was a hall table there, with a pitcher ofwater and glasses, a dish of fruit and a fruit knife. .Better not come anyfarther,“ he advised Jubal, .or Patty would have to escort you back throughher pets.“Mike poured himself a glass of water, drank part of it. .Preaching is thirstywork.“ He handed the glass to Anne. then took the fruit knife and sliced off achunk of apple. 　　It seemed to Jubal that Mike sliced off one of his fingers . . . but his attentionwas distracted as Duke passed the glass to him. Mike’s hand was notbleeding and Jubal had grown somewhat accustomed to legerdemain. Heaccepted the glass and took a sip, finding that his own throat was very dry. 　　Mike gripped his arm and smiled. .Quit fretting. This will take only a fewminutes. See you later, Father.“ They went out through the guardian cobrasand the door closed. Jubal went back to the room where the others were, stillcarrying the glass. Someone took it from him; he did not notice, as he waswatching images in the big tank. 　　The mob seemed denser, surging about and held back by police armed onlywith night sticks. There were a few shouts but mostly just the unlocalizedmuttering of crowd. 　　Someone said, .Where are they now, Patty?“.They’ve just dropped down the tube. Michael is a little ahead, Duke stoppedto catch Anne. They’re entering the lobby. Michael has been spotted, picturesare being taken.“The scene in the tank resolved into enormous head and shoulders of abrightly cheerful newscaster: .This is NWNW New World Networks’ mobilenewshound on the spot while it’s hot-your newscaster, Happy Holliday. Wehave just learned that the fake messiah, sometimes known as the Man fromMars, has crawled out of his hide-out in a hotel room here in beautiful St. 　　Petersburg, the City that Has Everything to Make You Sing. Apparently Smithis about to surrender to the authorities. He crushed out of jail just yesterday,using high explosives smuggled in to him by his fanatic followers. But thetight cordon placed around this city seems to have been too much for hint Wedon’t know yet-I repeat, we don’t know yet-so stay with the chap who coversthe map-and now a word from your local sponsor who has given you thiskeyhole peep at the latest leap-. 　　.Thank you, Happy Holliday and all you good people watching via NWNW! 　　What Price Paradise? Amazingly Low! Come out and see for yourself atElysian Fields, just opened as homesites for a restricted clientele. Landreclaimed from the warm waters of the glorious gulf and every lot guaranteedto be at least eighteen inches above mean high water and only a small downpayment on a Happy-oh, oh, later, friends-phone Gulf nine-two eight twoeight!“.And thank you, Jick Morris and the developers of Elysian Fields! I thinkwe’ve got something, folks! Yes, sir, I think we do-. 　　(.They’re coming out the front entrance,“ Patty said quietly. .The crowd hasn’tspotted Michael yet.“).Maybe not yet ... but soon. You are now looking at the main entrance of themagnificent Sans Souci Hotel, Gem of the Gulf, whose management is in noway responsible for this hunted fugitive and who have cooperated with theauthorities throughout according to a statement just issued by Chief of PoliceDavis. And while we’re waiting to see what will happen, a few high lights inthe strange career of this half-human monster raised on Mars-. 　　The live scene was replaced by quick cuts of stock shots: The Envoy blastingoff years earlier, the Champion floating upwards silently and effortlesslyunder Lyle Drive, Martians on Mars, the triumphant return of the Champion, aquick of the first faked interview with the .Man from Mars“-.What do you thinkof the girls here on Earth?“ .Gee!“-a quicker shot of the conference in theExecutive Palace and the muchpublicized awarding of a doctorate inphilosophy, all with rapid-fire commentary. 　　.See anything, Patty?“.Michael is at the top of the steps, the crowd is at least a hundred yardsaway, being kept off the hotel grounds. Duke has grabbed some pix and Mikeis waiting to let him change lenses. No hurry.“Happy Holliday Went on, as the tank shifted to the crowd, semi-close andpanning: .You understand, friends, that this wonderful community is in aunique condition today. Something strange has been going on and thesepeople are in no mood to trifle. Their laws have been flouted, their securityforces treated with contempt, they are angry, righteously so. The fanaticfollowers of this alleged antichrist have stopped at nothing to create turmoil ina futile effort to let their leader escape the closing net of justice. Anything canhappen-anything!“The announcer’s voice climbed: .Yes, he’s coming out now-he’s walkingtoward the people!“ The scene cut to reverse; Mike was walking directlytoward another camera. Anne and Duke were behind him and droppingfarther behind. .This is it! This is it! This is the blow-off’.“Mike continued to walk unhurriedly toward the crowd until he loomed up inthe stereo tank in life size, as if he were in the room with his water brothers. 　　He stopped on the grass verge in front of the hotel, a few feet from thecrowd. .You called me?“He was answered with a growl. 　　The sky held scattered clouds; at that instant the sun caine out from behindone and a shaft of golden light hit him. 　　His clothes vanished. He stood before them, a golden youth, clothed only inhis own beauty-beauty that made Jubal’s heart ache, thinking thatMichelangelo in his ancient years would have climbed down from his highscaffolding to record it for generations unborn. Mike said gently, .Look at me. 　　I am a son of man.“The scene cut for a ten-second plug, a line of can-can dancers singing: 　　.Come on, ladies, do your duds! 　　In the smoothest, yummiest suds! 　　Lover Soap is kind to hands-But be sure you save the bands!“The tank filled completely with foamy suds amid girlish laughter and thescene cut back to the newscast: .God damn you!“ A half brick caught Mike inthe ribs. He turned his face slightly toward his assailant. .But you yourself areGod. You can damn only yourself . . . and you can never escape yourself.“.Blasphemer!“ A rock caught him just over his left eye and blood welledforth. 　　Mike said calmly, .In fighting me, you fight yourself... for Thou art God and Iam God . . . and all that groks is God-there is no other.“More rocks hit him, from various directions; he began to bleed in severalplaces. .Hear the Truth. You need not hate, you need not fight, you need notfear. I offer you the water of life-. Suddenly his hand held a tumbler of water,sparkling in the sunlight. .-and you may share it whenever you so will . . . andwalk in peace and love and happiness together.“A rock caught the glass and shattered it. Another struck him in the mouth. 　　Through bruised and bleeding lips he smiled at them, looking straight into thecamera with an expression of yearning tenderness on his face. Some trick ofsunlight and stereo formed a golden halo back of his head. .Oh my brothers,I love you so! Drink deep. Share and grow closer without end. Thou art God.“Jubal whispered it back to him. The scene made a five-second cut: 　　.Cahuenga Cave! The night club with real Los Angeles smog, imported freshevery day. Six exotic dancers.“.Lynch him! Give the bastard a nigger necktie!“ A heavy-gauge shotgunblasted at close range and Mike’s right arm was struck off at the elbow andfell. It floated gently down, then came to rest on the cool grasses, its handcurved open in invitation. 　　.Give him the other barrel, Shortie-and aim closer!“ The crowd laughed andapplauded. A brick smashed Mike’s nose and more rocks gave him a crownof blood. 　　.The Truth is simple but the Way of Man is hard. First you must learn tocontrol yourself. The rest follows. Blessed is he who knows himself andcommands himself, for the world is his and love and happiness and peacewalk with him wherever he goes.“ Another shotgun blast was followed by twomore shots. One shot, a forty-five slug, hit Mike over the heart, shattering thesixth rib near the sternum and making a large wound; the buckshot and theother slug sheered through his left tibia five inches below the patella and leftthe fibula sticking out at an angle, broken and white against the yellow andred of the wound. 　　Mike staggered slightly and laughed, went on talking, his words clear andunhurried. .Thou art God. Know that and the Way is opened.“.God damn it-let’s stop this taking the Name of the Lord in vain!“- .Come on,men! Let’s finish him!“ The mob surged forward, led by one bold with a club;they were on him with rocks and fists, and then with feet as he went down. 　　He went on talking while they kicked his ribs in and smashed his goldenbody, broke his bones and tore an ear loose. At last someone called out,.Back away a little so we can get the gasoline on him!“The mob opened up a little at that waning and the camera zoomed to pick uphis face and shoulders. The Man from Mars smiled at his brothers, said oncemore, softly and clearly, .I love you.“ An incautious grasshopper camewhirring to a landing on the grass a few inches from his face; Mike turned hishead, looked at it as it stared back at him. .Thou art God,“ he said happilyand discorporated.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/356.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
