{"id":32547,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"A FEW MINUTES LATER Jill reported to Jubal’s study. Anne was there,seated and enveloped in the long white robe of her guild; she glanced at Jill,said nothing. Jill found a chair and kept quiet, as Jubal was at his desk anddictating to Dorcas; he did not appear to notice Jill’s arrival and went ondictating:\n 　　.-from under the sprawled body, soaking one corner of the rug and seepingout beyond it in a spreading dark red pool on the tiled hearth, where it wasattracting the attention of two unemployed flies. Miss Simpson clutched at hermouth. .Dear me!’ she said in a distressed small voice, .Daddy’s favorite rug!\n 　　. . . and Daddy, too, I do believe.’ End of chapter, Dorcas, and end of firstinstallment. Mail it off. Git.“Dorcas stood up and left, taking along her shorthand machine, and noddingand smiling to Jill as she did so. Jubal said, .Where’s Mike?“.In his room,“ answered Gillian, .dressing. He’ll be along soon.“.’Dressing’?“ Jubal repeated peevishly. .I didn’t say the party wasformal.“.But he has to get dressed.“.Why? It makes no never-mind to me whether you kids wear skin or fleecelinedovercoats-and it’s a warm day. Chase him in here.“.Please, Jubal. He’s got to learn how to behave. I’m trying so hard to trainhim.“.Hmmph! You’re trying to force on him your own narrow-minded, middleclass, Bible Belt morality. Don’t think I haven’t been watching.“.I have not! I haven’t concerned myself with his morals; I’ve simply beenteaching him necessary customs.“.Customs, morals-is there a difference? Woman, do you realize what you aredoing? Here, by the grace of God and an inside straight, we have apersonality untouched by the psychotic taboos of our tribe-.—and you want toturn him into a carbon copy of every fourth-rate conformist in this frightenedland! Why don’t you go whole hog? Get him a brief case and make him carryit wherever he goes-make him feel shame if he doesn’t have it.“.I’m not doing anything of the sort! I’m just trying to keep him out of trouble.\n 　　It’s for his own good.“Jubal snorted. .That’s the excuse they gave the tomcat just before hisoperation.“.Oh!“ Jill stopped and appeared to be counting ten. Then she said formallyand blealdy, .This is your house, Doctor Harshaw, and we are in your debt. Ifyou will excuse me, I will fetch Michael at once.“ She got up to leave.\n 　　.Hold it, Jill.“.Sir?“.Sit back down-and for God’s sake quit trying to be as nasty as I am; youdon’t have my years of practice. Now let me get something straight: you arenot in my debt. You can’t be. Impossible-because I never do anything I don’twant to do. Nor does anyone, but in my case I am always aware of it. Soplease don’t invent a debt that does not exist, or before you know it you willbe trying to feel gratitude-and that is the treacherous first step downward tocomplete moral degradation. You grok that? Or don’t you?“Jill bit her lip, then grinned. .I’m not sure I know what .grok’ means.“.Nor do I. But I intend to go on taking lessons from Mike until I do. But I wasspeaking dead seriously. Gratitude is a euphemism for resentment.\n 　　Resentment from most people I do not mind-but from pretty little girls it isdistasteful to me.“.Why, Jubal, I don’t resent you-that’s silly.“.I hope you don’t... but you certainly will if you don’t root out of your mind thisdelusion that you are indebted to me. The Japanese have five different waysto say .thank you’-and every one of them translates literally as resentment, invarious degrees. Would that English had the same built-in honesty on thispoint! Instead, English is capable of defining sentiments that the humannervous system is quite incapable of experiencing. .Gratitude,’ for example.“.Jubal, you’re a cynical old man. I do feel grateful to you and I shall go onfeeling grateful.“.And you are a sentimental young girl. That makes us a perfectcomplementary pair. Hmm - let’s run over to Atlantic City for a weekend ofillicit debauchery, just us two.“.Why, Jubal!“.You see how deep your gratitude goes when I attempt to draw on it?“.Oh. I’m ready. How soon do we leave?“.Hmmmphtt We should have left forty years ago. Shut up. The second point Iwant to make is that you are right; the boy does indeed have to learn humancustoms. He must be taught to take off his shoes in a mosque and to wearhis hat in a synagogue and to cover his nakedness when taboo requires it, orour tribal shamans will burn him for deviationism. But, child, by the myriaddeceptive aspects of Ahrilflafl, don’t brainwash him in the process. Make surehe is cynical about each part of it.“.Uh, I’m not sure how to go about that, Jubal. Well, Mike just doesn’t seem tohave any cynicism in him.“.So? Yes. Well, I’ll take a band in it. What’s keeping him? Shouldn’t he bedressed by now?“.I’ll go see.“.In a moment. Jill, I explained to you why I had not been anxious to accuseanyone of kidnapping Ben . . . and the reports I have had since Serve tosupport the probability that that was a tactically correct decision. If Ben isbeing unlawfully detained (to put it at its sweetest), at least we have notcrowded the opposition into getting rid of the evidence by getting rid o~ Ben.\n 　　If he is alive he stands a chance of staying alive. But I took 0ther steps theIlrst night you were here. Do you know your Bible?“.Uh, not very well.“.It merits study, it contains very practical advice for most emergencies. .-every one that doeth evil hateth the light-. John something or other, Jesusspeaking to Nicodeus. I have been expecting at any moment an attempt toget Mike away from us, for it didn’t seem likely that you had managed tocover your tracks perfectly. And if they do try? Well, this is a lonely place andwe haven’t any heavy artillery. But there is one weapon that might balk them.\n 　　Light. The glaring spotlight of publicity. So I made some phone calls andarranged for any ruckus here to have publicity. Not just a little publicity thatthe administration might be able to hush up, but great gobs of publicityworldwide and all at once. The details do not matter-where and how thecameras are mounted and what line of sight linkages have been rigged, Imean. But if a fight breaks out here, it will be picked up by three networksand, at the same time, a number of hold for release messages will bedelivered to a wide spread of V.I.P.s, all of whom would like very much tocatch our Honorable Secretary General with his pants down.“Harshaw frowned. .The weakness in this defense is that I can’t maintain itindefinitely. Truthfully, when I set it up, my worry was to set up fast enough-Iexpected whatever popped’ to pop inside of twenty four hours. Now my worryis reversed and I think we are going to have to force some action quicklywhile I can still keep a spotlight on us.“.What sort of action, Jubal?“.I don’t know. I’ve been fretting about it the past three days, to the pointwhere I can’t enjoy my food. But you gave me a glitn1Uefl0~ of a newapproach when you told me that remarkable story about what happenedwhen they tried to grab you two in Ben’s apartment.“.I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, Jubal. But I didn’t think anybody wouldbelieve me and I must say that it makes me feel good that you do believeme.“.I didn’t say I believed you.“.What? But you-.\n 　　.I think you were telling the truth, Jill. But a dream IS a true experience of asort and so is a hypnotic delusion. But what happens in this room during thenext half hour will be seen by a Fair Witness and by cameras which are“ heleaned forward and pressed a button. .rolling right now. I don’t think Annecan be hypnotized when she’s on duty and I’ll lay long odds that camerascan’t be. We should be able to find out what kind of truth we’re dealing withafterwhich we should be able to decide how to go about forcing the powersthat-be to drop the other shoe . . . and maybe figure a way that will help Benat the same time. Go get Mike.“Mike’s delay was not mysterious, merely worrisome to him. He had managedto tie his left shoestring to his right-then had stood up, tripped himself, fallenflat, and, in so doing, jerked the knots almost hopelessly tight. He had spentthe rest of the time analysing his predicament, concluding correctly why hehad failed, and slowly, slowly, slowly getting the snarl untied and the stringscorrectly tied, one bow to each shoe, unlinked. He had not been aware thathis dressing had taken long; he had simply been troubled that he had failedto repeat correctly something which Jill had already taught him. Heconfessed his failure abjectly to her even though he had repaired it by thetime she came to fetch him.\n 　　She soothed and reassured him, combed his hair, and herded him in to seeJubal. Harshaw looked up. .Hi, son. Sit down.“.Hi, Jubal,“ Valentine Michael Smith answered gravely, sat down- waited. Jillhad to rid herself of the impression that Smith had bowed deeply, when infact he had not even nodded.\n 　　Harshaw put aside a hush-mike and said, .Well, boy what have youlearned today?“Smith smiled happily, then answered-as always with a slight pause. .I havetoday learned to do a one-and-a-half gainer. That is a jumping, a dive, forentering our water by-.\n 　　.I know, I saw you doing it. But you splashed. Keep your toes pointed, yourknees straight, and your feet together.“Smith looked unhappy. .I rightly did not it do?“.You did it very rightly, for a first time. Watch how Dorcas does it. Hardly aripple in the water.“Smith considered this slowly. .The water groks Dorcas. It cherishes him.“.’Her.’ Dorcas is a .her,’ not a .him.’“.’Her,’ . Smith corrected. .Then my speaking was false? I have read inWebster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language, ThirdEdition, published in Springfield, Massachusetts, that the masculine genderincludes the feminine gender in speaking. In Hagworth’s Law of Contracts,Fifth Edition, Chicago, Illinois, 1978, on page 1012, it says-.\n 　　.Hold it,“ Harshaw said hastily. .The trouble is with the English language, notwith you. Masculine speech forms do include the feminine, when you arespeaking in general-but not when you are talking about a particular person.\n 　　Dorcas is always .she’ or .her’-never .he’ or .him.’ Remember it.“.I will remember it.“.You had better remember it-~r you may provoke Dorcas into proving justhow female she is.“ Harshaw blinked thoughtfully. .Jill, is the lad sleepingwith you? Or with one of you?“She barely hesitated, then answered flatly, .SO far as I know, Mike doesn’tsleep.“.You evaded my question.“.Then perhaps you had better assume that I intended to evade it. However,he is not sleeping with me.“.Mmm .. damn it, my interest is scientific. However, we’ll pursue another lineof inquiry. Mike, what else have you learned today?“.I have learned two ways to tie my shoes. One way is only good for lyingdown. The other way is good for walking. And I have learned conjugations. .Iam, thou art, he is, we are, you are, they are, I was, thou wast-.\n 　　.Okay, that’s enough. What else?“Mike smiled delightedly. .To yesterday I am learning to drive the tractor,brightly, brightly, and with beauty.“.Eh?“ Jubal turned to Jill. .When did this happen?“.Yesterday afternoon while you were napping, Jubal. It’s all right- Duke wasvery careful not to let him get hurt.“.Umm ... well, obviously he did not get hurt. Mike, have you been reading?“.Yes, Jubal.“.What?“.I have read,“ Mike recited carefully, .three more volumes of theEncyclopedia, Maryb to Mushe, Mushr to Ozon, P to Planti. You have told menot to read too much of the Encyclopedia at one reading, so I then stopped. Ithen read the Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by Master William Shakespeareof London. I then read the Memoirs of Jacques Casanova de Sein gait astranslated into English by Arthur Machen. I then read The Art of Cross-Exammat ion by Francis Weilman. I then tried to grok what I had read until Jill toldme that I must come to breakfast.“.And did you grok it?“Smith looked troubled. .Jubal, I do not know.“.Is anything bothering you, Mike?“.I do not grok all fullness of what I read. In the history written by MasterWilliam Shakespeare I found myself full of happiness at the death of Romeo.\n 　　Then I read on and learned that he had discorporated too soon-or so Ithought I grokked. Why?“.He was a blithering young idiot.“.Beg pardon?“.I don’t know, Mike.“Smith considered this. Then he muttered something in Martian and added,.I am only an egg.“.Eh? You usually say that when you want to ask a favor, Mike. What is it thistime? Speak up.“Smith hesitated. Then he blurted out, .Jubal my brother, would please youask Romeo why he discorporated? I cannot ask him; I am only an egg. Butyou can-and then you could teach me the grokking of it.“For the next several minutes the conversation became very tangled. Jubalsaw at once that Mike believed that Romeo of Montague had been a living,breathing person, and Jubal managed with no special shock to his ownconcepts to realize that Mike expected him to be able, somehow, to conjureup Romeo’s ghost and demand of him explanations for his conduct when inthe flesh.\n 　　But to get over to Mike the idea that none of the Capulets and Montagueshad ever had any sort of corporate existence was another matter. Theconcept of fiction was nowhere in Mike’s experience; there was nothing onwhich it could rest, and Jubal’s attempts to explain the idea were soemotionally upsetting to Mike that Jill was afraid that he was about to roll upinto a ball and withdraw himself.\n 　　But Mike himself saw how perilously close he was coming to that necessityand he had already learned that he must not resort to this refuge in thepresence of his friends, because (with the exception of his brother DoctorNelson) it always caused them emotional disturbance. So he made a mightyeffort, slowed down his heart, calmed his emotions, and smiled. .I will waitingtill a grokking comes of itself.“.That’s better,“ agreed Jubal. .But hereafter, before you read anything, askme or ask Jill, or somebody, whether or not it is fiction. I don’t want you to getmixed up.“.I will ask, Jubal.“ Mike decided that, when he did grok this strange idea, thathe must report the fullness to the Old Ones . . . and suddenly found himselfwondering if the Old Ones knew about .fiction.“ The completely incredibleidea that there might be something which was as strange to the Old Ones asit was to himself was so much more revolutionary (indeed heretically so) thanthe sufficiently weird concept of fiction that he hastily put it aside to cool,saved it for future deep contemplation.\n 　　.-but I didn’t,“ his brother Jubal was saying, .call you in here to discussliterary forms. Mike, you remember the day that Jill took you away from thehospital?“.’Hospital’?“ Mike repeated.\n 　　.I’m not sure, Jubal,“ Jill interrupted, .that Mike ever knew that it was ahospital-at least I never told him it was one. Let me try it.“.Go ahead.“.Mike, you remember the place where you were, where you lived alone in aroom, before I dressed you and took you away.“.Yes, Jill.“.Then we went to another place and I undressed you and gave you abath.“Smith smiled in pleased recollection. .Yes. It was a great happiness.“.Then I dried you off-and then two men came.“Smith’s smile wiped away. He relived that critical cusp of decision and thehorror of his discovery that, somehow, he had chosen wrong action and hurthis water brother. He began to tremble and huddle into himself.\n 　　Jill said loudly, .Mike! Stop it! Stop it at once! Don’t you dare go away!“Mike took control of his being and did what his water brother required of him.\n 　　.Yes, Jill,“ he agreed.\n 　　.Listen to me, Mike. I want you to think about that time-but you mustn’t getupset or go away. Just remember it. There were two men there. One of thempulled you Out into the living room.“.The room with the joyful grasses on the floor,“ he agreed.\n 　　.That’s right. He pulled you Out into the room with the grass on the floor and Itried to stop him. He hit me. Then he was gone. Y~u remember?“.You are not angry?“.What? No, no, not at all. But I was frightened. One man disappeared, thenthe other one pointed a gun at me-and then he was gone, too. I was veryfrightened-but I was not angry.“.You are not angry with me now?“.Mike, dear-I have never been angry with you. But sometimes I have beenfrightened. I was frightened that time-but I am not afraid now. Jubal and Iwant to know what happened. Those two men were there, in that room withus. And then you did something . . . and they were gone. You did it twice.\n 　　What was it you did? Can you tell us?“.Yes, I will tell you. The man-the big man-hit you ... and I was frightened, too.\n 　　So I-. He croaked a phrase in Martian, then looked puzzled. .I do not knowwords.“Jubal said, .Mike, can you use a lot of words and explain it a little at atime?“.I will try, Jubal. Something is there, in front of me. It is a wrong thing and itmust not be there. It must go. So I reach out and-. He stopped again andlooked perplexed. .It is such a simple thing, such an easy thing. Anyone cando it. Tying shoe laces is much more hard. But the words not are. I am verysorry. I will learn more words.“ He considered it. .Perhaps the words are inPlants to Raym, or Rayn to Sarr, or Sars to Sorc. I will read them tonight andtell you at breakfast.“.Maybe,“ Jubal admitted. .Just a minute, Mike.“ He got up from his desk,went to a corner and returned with a large carton which had lately containedtwelve fifths of brandy. .Can you make this go away?“.This is a wrong thing and it must not be here?“.Well, assume that it is.“.But-Jubal, I must know that it is a wrong thing. This is a box. I do not grokthat it exists wrongly.“.Mmm- I see. I think I see. Suppose I picked up this box and threw it at Jill’shead? Threw it hard, so that it would hurt her?“Smith said with gentle sadness, .Jubal, you would not do that to Jill.“.Uh ... damn it. I guess I wouldn’t. Jill, will you throw the box at me? Goodand hard-a scalp wound at least, if Mike can’t protect me.“.Jubal, I don’t like the idea much better than you do.“.Oh, come on! In the interest of science ... and Ben Caxton.“.But-. Jill jumped up suddenly, grabbed the box, threw it right at Jubal’s head.\n 　　Jubal intended to stand and take it-but instinct and habit won out; he ducked.\n 　　.Missed me,“ he said. .But where is it?“ He looked around. .Confound it, Iwasn’t watching. I meant to keep my eyes right on it.“ He looked at Smith.\n 　　.Mike, is that the way-what’s the matter, boy?“The Man from Mars was trembling and looking unhappy. Jill hurried to himand put her arms around his shoulders. .There, there, it’s all right, dear! Youdid it beautifully-whatever it is. It never touched Jubal. It simply vanished.“.I guess it did,“ Jubal admitted, looking all around the room and chewing histhumb. .Anne, were you watching?“.Yes.“.What did you see?“.The box did not simply vanish. The process was not quite instantaneous butlasted some measurable fraction of a second. From where I am sitting itappeared to shrink very, very rapidly, as if it were disappearing into the fardistance. But it did not go outside the room, for I could see it right up to theinstant it disappeared.“.But where did it go?“.That is all I can report.“.Mmm ... we’ll run off the films later-but I’m convinced. Mike-.\n 　　.Yes, Jubal?“.Where is that box now?“.The box is-. Smith paused. .Again I have not words. I am sorry.“.I’m not sorry, but I’m certainly confused. Look, son, can you reach in againand haul it out? Bring the box back here?“.Beg pardon?“.You made it go away; now make it come back.“.How can I do that? The box is nor.“Jubal looked very thoughtful. .If this method ever becomes popular, we’llhave to revise the rules concerning corpus delecti. .I’ve got a little list theynever will be missed.’ Jill, let’s find something else that will make a not-quitelethalweapon; this time I’m going to keep my eyes open. Mike, how close doyou have to be to do this trick?“.Beg pardon?“.What’s your range? If you had been standing out there in the hallway and Ihad been clear back by the window-oh, say thirty feet-could you havestopped that box from hitting me?“Smith appeared mildly surprised. .Yes.“.Hmm ... come over here by the window. Now look down there at theswimming poo1. Suppose that Jill and I had been over on the far side of thepool and you had been standing right where you are. Could you havestopped the box from here?“.Yes, Jubal.“.Well ... suppose Jill and I were clear down the road there at the gate, aquarter of a mile away. Suppose we were standing just this side of thosebushes that shield the gate, where you could see us clearly. Is that too far?“Smith hesitated a long time, then spoke slowly. .Jubal, it is not the distance.\n 　　It is not the seeing. It is the knowing.“.Hmm ... let’s see if I grok it. Or grok part of it. It doesn’t matter how far orhow close a thing is. You don’t even have to see it happening. But if youknow that a bad thing is happening, you can reach out and stop it. Right?“Smith looked slightly troubled. .Almost it is right. But I am not long out of thenest. For knowing I must see. But an Old One does not need eyes to know.\n 　　He knows. He groks. He acts. I am sorry.“.I don’t know what you are sorry about, son,“ Jubal said gruffly. .The HighMinister for Peace would have declared you Top Secret ten minutes ago.“.Beg pardon?“.Never mind. What you do is quite good enough in this vicinity.“ Jubalreturned to his desk, looked around thoughtfully and picked up a ponderousmetal ash tray. .Jill, don’t aim at my face this time; this thing has sharpcorners. Okay, Mike, you stand clear out in the hallway.“.Jubal ... my brother . . . please not!“.What’s the trouble, son? You did it beautifully a few minutes ago. I want onemore demonstration-and this time I won’t take my eyes off it.“.Jubal-.\n 　　.Yes, Jill?“.I think I grok what is bothering Mike.“.Well, tell me then, for I don’t.“.We set up an experiment where I was about to hurt you by hitting you withthat box. But both of us are his water brothers-so it upset Mike that I eventried to hurt you. I think there is something very unMartian about such asituation. It puts Mike in a dilemma. Divided loyalty.“Harshaw frowned. .Maybe it should be investigated by the Committee onun-Martian Activities.“.I’m not joking, Jubal.“.Nor was I-for we may need such a committee all too soon. I won. der howMrs. O’Leary’s cow felt as she kicked the lantern? All right, Jill, you sit downand I’ll re-rig the experiment.“ Harshaw handed the ash tray to Mike. .Feelhow heavy it is, son, and see those sharp corners.“Smith examined it somewhat gingerly. Harshaw went on, .I’m going to throwit straight up in the air, clear to the ceiling-and let it hit me in the head as itcomes down.“Mike stared at him. .My brother ... you will now discorporate?“.Eh? No, no! It won’t kill me and I don’t want to die. But it will cut me and hurtme-unless you stop it. Here we go!“ Harshaw tossed it straight up withininches of the high ceiling, tracking it with his eyes like a soccer player waitingto pass the ball with his head. He concentrated on watching it, while one partof his mind was considering jerking his head aside at the last instant ratherthan take the nasty scalp wound the heavy, ugly thing was otherwise sure togive him-and another small piece of his mind reckoned cynically that hewould never miss this chattel; he had never liked it-but it had been a gift.\n 　　The ash tray topped its trajectory, and stayed there.\n 　　Harshaw looked at it, with a feeling that he was stuck in one frame of amotion picture. Presently he remembered to breathe and found that heneeded to, badly. Without taking his eyes off it he croaked, .Anne. What doyou see?“She answered in a flat voice, .That ash tray is five inches from the ceiling. Ido not see anything holding it up.“ Then she added in tones less certain,.Jubal, I think that’s what I’m seeing ... but if the cameras don’t show thesame thing, I’m going to turn in my robe and tear up my license.“.Um. Jill?“.It floats. It just floats.“Jubal sighed, Went to his chair and sat down heavily, all without taking hiseyes off the unruly ash tray. .Mike,“ he said, .what went wrong? Why didn’t itdisappear like the box?“.But, Jubal,“ Mike said apologetically, .you said to stop it; you did not say tomake it go away. When I made the box go away, you wanted it to be again.\n 　　Have I done wrongly?“.Oh. No, you have done exactly right. I keep forgetting that you always takethings literally.“ Harshaw recalled certain colloquial insults common in hisearly years-and reminded himself forcefully never, never to use any of suchto Michael Valentine Smith-for, if he told the boy to drop dead or to get lost,Harshaw now felt certain that the literal meaning of his words would at onceensue.\n 　　.I am glad,“ Smith answered soberly. .I am sorry I could not make the box beagain. I am sorry twice that I wasted so much food. But I did not know how tohelp it. Then a necessity was. Or so I grokked.“.Eh? What food?“Jill said hastily, .He’s talking about those two men, Jubal. Berquist and thecop with him-if he was a cop. Johnson.“.Oh, yes.“ Harshaw reflected that he himself still retained unMartian notionsof food, subconsciously at least. .Mike, I wouldn’t worry about wasting that.food.’ They probably would have been tough and poor flavor. I doubt if ameat inspector would have passed them. In fact,“ he added, recalling theFederation convention about .long pig,“ .I am certain that they would havebeen condemned as unfit for food. So don’t worry about it. Besides, as yousay, it was a necessity. You grokked the fullness and acted rightly.“.I am much comforted,“ Mike answered with great relief in his voice. .Only anOld One can always be sure of right action at a cusp ... and I have muchlearning to learn and much growing to grow before I may join the Old Ones.\n 　　Jubal? May I move it? I am tiring.“.You want to make it go away now? Go ahead.“.But now I cannot.“.Eh? Why not?“.Your head is no longer under it. I do not grok wrongness in its being,where it is.“.Oh. All right. Move it.“ Harshaw continued to watch it, expecting that it wouldfloat to the spot now over his head and thus regain a wrongness. Instead theash tray moved downward at a slow, steady speed, moved sideways until itwas close above his desk top, hovered for a moment, then slid to an emptyspot and came in to an almost noiseless landing.\n 　　.Thank you, Jubal,“ said Smith.\n 　　.Eh? Thank YOU, Son!“ Jubal picked up the ash tray, examined it curiously.\n 　　It was neither hot nor cold nor did it make his fingers tingle-it was as ugly,over-decorated, commonplace, and dirty as it had been five minutes earlier.\n 　　.Yes, thank you. For the most amazing experience I’ve had since the day thehired girl took me up into the attic.“ He looked up. .Anne, you trained atRhine.“.Yes.“.Have you seen levitation before?“She hesitated slightly. .I’ve seen what was called telekinesis with dice -butI’m no mathematician and I could not testify that what I saw was telekinesis.“.Hell’s bells, you wouldn’t testify that the sun had risen if the day wascloudy.“.How could I? Somebody might be supplying artificial light from above thecloud layer. One of my classmates could apparently levitate objects about themass of a paper clip-but he had to be just three drinks drunk and sometimeshe couldn’t do it at all. I was never able to examine the phenomenon closelyenough to be competent to testify about it partly because I usually had threedrinks in me by then, too.“.Then you’ve never seen anything like this?“.No.“.Mmm...I’m through with you professionally; I’m convinced. But if you want tostay and see what else happens, hang up your robe and drag up a chair.“.Thanks, I will-both. But, in view of the lecture you gave Jill about mosquesand synagogues, I’ll go to my room first. I wouldn’t want to cause a hiatus inthe indoctrination.“.Suit yourself. While you’re out, wake up Duke and tell him I want thecameras serviced again.“.Yes, Boss. Don’t let anything startling happen until I get back.“ Anneheaded for the door.\n 　　.No promises. Mike, sit down here at my desk. You, too, Jill-gather .round.\n 　　Now, Mike, can you pick up that ash tray? Show me.“.Yes, Jubal.“ Smith reached out and took it in his hand.\n 　　.No, no!“.I did wrongly?“.No, it was my mistake. Mike, put it back down. I want to know if you can liftthat ash tray without touching it?“.Yes, Jubal.“.Well? Are you too tired?“.No, Jubal. I am not too tired.“.Then what’s the matter? Does it have to have a .wrongness’ about it?“.No, Jubal.“.Jubal,“ Jill interrupted, .you haven’t told him to do it-you’ve just asked himif he could.“.Oh.“ Jubal looked as sheepish as he was capable of looking, which was notmuch. .I should learn. Mike, will you please, without touching it with yourhands, lift that ash tray a foot above the desk?“.Yes, Jubal.“ The ash tray raised, floated steadily above the desk. .Will youmeasure, Jubal?“ Mike said anxiously. .If I did wrongly, I will move it up ordown.“.That’s just fine! Can you hold it there? If you get tired, tell me.“.I can. I will tell.“.Can you lift something else at the same time? Say this pencil? If youcan, then do it.“.Yes, Jubal,“ The pencil ranged itself neatly by the ash tray.\n 　　By request, Mike added other small articles from the desk to the layer offloating objects. Anne returned, pulled up a chair and watched theperformance without speaking. Duke came in, carrying a step ladder, glancedat the group, then looked a second time, but said nothing and set the ladderin one corner. At last Mike said uncertainly, .I am not sure, Jubal. I-. Hestopped and seemed to search for a word. .I am idiot in these things.“.Don’t wear yourself out.“.I can think one more. I hope.“ A paper weight across the desk from Mikestirred, lifted-and all the dozen-odd floating objects fell down at once. Mikeseemed about to weep although no tears formed. .Jubal, I am sorry. I amutmostly sorry.“Harshaw patted his shoulder. .You should be proud, not sorry. Son, you don’tseem to realize it, but what you just did is-. Jubal searched for a comparison,rapidly discarded the many that sprang to his mind because he realized thatthey touched nothing in Mike’s experience. .What you did is much harderthan tying shoestrings, much more wonderful to us than doing a one.and-ahalfgainer perfectly. You did it, uh, .brightly, brightly, and with beauty.’ Yougrok?“Mike looked surprised. .I am not sure, Jubal. I should not feel shame?“.You must not feel shame. You should feel proud.“.Yes, Jubal,“ he answered contentedly. .I feel proud.“.Good. Mike, I cannot lift even one ash tray without touching it.“Smith looked startled. .You cannot?“.No. Can you teach me?“.Yes, Jubal. You-. Smith stopped speaking, looked embarrassed. .I againhave not words. I am sorry. But I will read and I will read and I will read, until Ifind the words. Then I will teach my brother.“.Don’t set your heart on it.“.Beg pardon?“.Mike, don’t be disappointed if you do not find the right words. You may notfind them in the English language.“Smith considered this quite a long time. .Then I will teach my brother thelanguage of my nest.“.Maybe. I would like to try-but you may have arrived about fifty yearstoo late.“.I have acted wrongly?“.Not at all. I’m proud of you. You might start by trying to teach Jill yourlanguage.“.It hurts my throat,“ put in Jill.\n 　　.Try gargling with aspirin.“ Jubal looked at her. .That’s a silly excuse, nursebutit occurs to me that this gives me an excuse to put you on the payroll . . .\n 　　for I doubt if they will ever take you back at Bethesda. All right, you’re mystaff research assistant for Martian linguistics which includes such extraduties as may be necessary. Take that up with the girls. Anne, put her on thepayroll-and be sure it gets entered in the tax records.“.She’s been doing her share in the kitchen since the day after she got here.\n 　　Shall I date it back?“Jubal shrugged. .Don’t bother me with details.“.But, Jubal,“ Jill protested shrilly, .I don’t think I can learn Martian!“.You can try, can’t you? That’s all Columbus did.“.But-.\n 　　.What was that idle chatter you were giving me about .gratitude’? Do youtake the job? Or don’t you?“Jill bit her lip. .I’ll take it. Yes ... Boss.“Smith timidly reached out and touched her hand. .Jill ... I will teach.“Jill patted his. .Thanks, Mike.“ She looked at Harshaw. .And I’m going tolearn it just to spite you!“He grinned warmly at her. .That’s a motive I grok perfectly-you’ll learn it allright. Now back to business- Mike, what else can you do that we can’t do?\n 　　Besides making things go away-when they have a .wrongness’-and liftingthings without touching them.“Smith looked puzzled. .I do not know.“.How could he know,“ protested Jill, .when he doesn’t really know what wecan and can’t do?“.Mmm .-. yes. Anne, change that job title to .staff research assistant forMartian linguistics, culture, and techniques.’ Jill, in learning their languageyou are bound to stumble Onto Martian things that are different, reallydifferent-and when you do, tell me. Everything and anything about a culturecan be inferred from the shape of its language-and you’re probably youngenough to learn to think like a Martian . . . which I misdoubt I am not. Andyou, Mike, if you notice anything which you can do but we don’t do, tell me.“.I will tell, Jubal. What things will be these?“.I don’t know. Things like you just did ... and being able to stay on the bottomof the pool much longer than we can. Hmm . . . Duke!“.Yes, Boss? I’ve got both hands full of flim. Don’t bother me.“.You can talk, can’t you? I noticed the pool is pretty murky.“.Yeah. I’m going to add precipitant tonight and vacuum it in themorning.“.How’s the count?“.The count is okay, the water is safe enough to serve at the table. It justlooks messy.“.Let it stay murky for the time being. Test it as usual. I’ll let you know when Iwant it cleaned up.“.Hell, Boss, nobody likes to swim in a pool that looks like dishwater. I wouldhave tidied it up long before this if there hadn’t been so much hooraw aroundhere this week.“.Anybody too fussy to swim in it can stay dry. Quit jawing about it, Duke; I’llexplain later. Films ready?“.Five minutes.“.Good. Mike, do you know what a gun is?“.A gun,“ Smith answered carefully, .is a piece of ordnance for throwingprojectiles by the force of some explosive, as gunpowder, consisting of atube or barrel closed at one end, where the-.\n 　　.Okay, okay. Do you grok it?“.I am not sure.“.Have you ever seen a gun?“.I do not know.“.Why, certainly you have,“ Jill interrupted. .Mike, think back to that time wewere talking about, in the room with the grass on the floor-but don’t get upsetnow! The big man hit me, you remember.“.Yes.“.The other man pointed something at me. In his hand.“.Yes. He pointed a bad thing at you.“.That was a gun.“.I had thinked that the word for that bad thing might be .gun.’ The Webster’sNew International Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition,published in-.\n 　　.That’s fine, son,“ Harshaw said hastily. .That was certainly a gun. Now listento me carefully. If someone points a gun at Jill again, what will you do?“Smith paused rather longer than usual. .You will not be angry if I wastefood?“.No, I would not be angry. Under those circumstances no one would be angryat you. But I am trying to find out something else. Could you make just thegun go away, without making the man who is pointing it go away?“Smith considered it. .Save the food?“.Uh, that isn’t quite what I mean. Could you cause the gun to go away withouthurting the man?“.Jubal, he would not hurt at all. I would make the gun go away, but the man Iwould just stop. He would feel no pain. He would simply be discorporate. Thefood he leaves after him would not damage at all.“Harshaw sighed. .Yes, I’m sure that’s the way it would be. But could youcause to go away just the gun? Not do anything else? Not .stop’ the man, notkill him, just let him go on living?“Smith considered it. .That would be much easier than doing both at once.\n 　　But, Jubal, if I left him still corporate, he might still hurt Jill. Or so I grok it.“Harshaw stopped long enough to remind himself that this baby innocent wasneither babyish nor innocent-was in fact sophisticated in a culture which hewas beginning to realize, however dimly, was far in advance of humanculture in some very mysterious ways . . . and that these naive remarks camefrom a superman-or what would do in place of a .superman“ for the timebeing. Then he answered Smith, choosing his words most carefully as hehad in mind a dangerous experiment and did not want disaster to follow fromsemantic mishap.\n 　　.Mike ... if you reach a-.cusp’----where you must do something in order toprotect Jill, you do it.“.Yes, Jubal. I will.“.Don’t worry about wasting food. Don’t worry about anything else.\n 　　Protect Jill.“.Always I will protect Jill.“.Good. But suppose a man pointed a gun at someone-or simply had it in hishand. Suppose you did not want or need to kill him . . , but you needed tomake the gun go away. Could you do it?“Mike paused only briefly. .I think I grok it. A gun is a wrong thing. But it mightbe needful for the man to remain corporate.“ He thought. .I can do if.“.Good. Mike, I am going to show you a gun. A gun is a wrong thing.“.A gun is a very wrong thing. I will make it go away.“.Don’t make it go away as soon as you see it.“.Not?“.Not. I will lift the gun and start to point it at you. Like this. Before I can get itpointed at you, make it go away. But don’t stop me, don’t hurt me, don’t killme, don’t do anything to me. Just the gun. Don’t waste me as food, either.“.Oh, I never would,“ Mike said earnestly. .When you discorporate, my brotherJubal, I hope to be allowed to eat of you myself, praising and cherishing youwith every bite . . . until I grok you in fullness.“Harshaw controlled a seasick reflex he had not felt in decades and answeredgravely, .Thank you, Mike.“.It is I who must thank you, my brother-and if it should come to be that I amselected before you, I hope that you will find me worthy of grokking. Sharingme with Jill. You would share me with Jill? Please?“Harshaw glanced at Jill, saw that she had kept her face serene- reflected thatshe probably was a rock-steady scrub nurse. .I will share you with Jill,“ hesaid solemnly. .But, Mike, no one of us will be food today, nor any time soon.\n 　　Right now I am going to show you this gun- and you wait until I say . . . andthen you be very careful, because I have, many things to do before I amready to discorporate.“.I will be careful, my brother.“.All right.“ Harshaw leaned over, grunting slightly, and opened a~ lowerdrawer of his desk. .Look in here, Mike. See the gun? I’m going to pick it up.\n 　　But don’t do anything until I tell you to. Girls-get up and move away to theleft; I don’t want it pointed at you. Okay. Mike, not yet.“ Harshaw reached forthe gun, a very elderly police special, took it out of the drawer. .Get ready,Mike. Now!“-and Harshaw did his very best to get the weapon aimed at theMan from Mars.\n 　　His hand was suddenly empty. No shock, no jar, no twisting-the gun wasgone and that was all.\n 　　Jubal found that he was shaking, so he stopped it. .Perfect,“ he said to Mike.\n 　　.You got it before I had it aimed at you. That’s utterly perfect.“.I am happy.“.So am I. Duke, did that get in the camera?“.Yup. I put in fresh film cartridges. You didn’t say.“.Good.“ Harshaw sighed and found that he was very tired. .That’s all today,kids. Run along. Go swimming. You, too, Anne.“Anne said, .Boss? You’ll tell me what the films show?“.Want to stay and see them?“.Oh, no! I couldn’t, not the parts I Witnessed. But I would like to know-laterwhetheror not they show that I’ve slipped my clutches.“.All right.“\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/331.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
