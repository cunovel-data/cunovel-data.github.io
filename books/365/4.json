{"id":32538,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"CAPTAIN WILLEM VAN TROMP was a man of humanity and good sense.\\n\\n 　　He radioed ahead: .My passenger must not, repeat, must not be subjected tothe strain of a public reception. Provide low-gee shuttle, stretcher andambulance service, and anned guard.“He sent his ship’s surgeon Dr. Nelson along to make sure that ValentineMichael Smith was installed in a suite in Bethesda Medical Center,transferred gently into a hydraulic bed, and protected from outside contact bymarine guards. Van Tromp himself went to an extraordinary session of theFederation High Council.\\n\\n 　　At the moment when Valentine Michael Smith was being lifted into bed, theHigh Minister for Science was saying testily, .Granted, Captain, that yourauthority as military commander of what was nevertheless primarily ascientific expedition gives you the right to order unusual medical service toprotect a person temporarily in your charge, I do not see why you nowpresume to interfere with the proper functions of my department. Why, Smithis a veritable treasure trove of scientific information!“.Yes. I suppose he is, sir.“.Then why-. The science minister broke off and turned to the High Ministerfor Peace and Military Security. .David? This matter is obviously now in myjurisdiction. Will you issue the necessary instructions to your people? Afterall, one can’t keep persons of the caliber of Professor Kennedy and DoctorOkajima, to mention just two, cooling their heels indefinitely. They won’tstand for it.“The peace minister did not answer but glanced inquiringly at Captain vanTromp. The captain shook his head. .No, sir.“.Why not?“ demanded the science minister. .You have admitted that heisn’t sick.“.Give the captain a chance to explain, Pierre,“ the peace minister advised.\\n\\n 　　.Well, Captain?“.Smith isn’t sick, sir,“ Captain van Tromp said to the peace minister, .but heisn’t well, either. He has never before been in a one-gravity field. He nowweighs more than two and one half times what he is used to and his musclesaren’t up to it. He’s not used to Earth-normal air pressure. He’s not used toanything and the strain is likely to be too much for him. Hell’s bells,gentlemen, I’m dog tired myself just from being at one-gee again-and I wasborn on this planet.“The science minister looked contemptuous. .If acceleration fatigue is all thatis worrying you, let me assure you, my dear Captain, that we had anticipatedthat. His respiration and heart action will be watched carefully. We are notentirely without imagination and forethought. After all, I’ve been out myself. Iknow how it feels. This man Smith must-.\\n\\n 　　Captain van Tromp decided that it was time to throw a tantrum. He couldexcuse it by his own fatigue-very real fatigue, he felt as if he had just landedon Jupiter-and he was smugly aware that even a high councilor could notafford to take too stiff a line with the commander of the first successfulMartian expedition.\\n\\n 　　So he interrupted with a snort of disgust. .link! .This man Smith-. This .man!’\\n\\n 　　Can’t you see that that is just what he is not?“.Eh?“.Smith ... is . . . not . . . a . . . man.“.Huh? Explain yourself, Captain.“.Smith is not a man. He is an intelligent creature with the genes and ancestryof a man, but he is not a man. He’s more a Martian than a man. Until wecame along he had never laid eyes on a human being. He thinks like aMartian, he feels like a Martian. He’s been brought up by a race which hasnothing in common with us. Why, they don’t even have sex. Smith has neverlaid eyes on a woman-still hasn’t if my orders have been carried out. He’s aman by ancestry, a Martian by environment. Now, if you want to drive himcrazy and waste that .treasure trove of scientific information,’ call in your fatheadedprofessors and let them badger him. Don’t give him a chance to getwell and strong and used to this madhouse planet. Just go ahead andsqueeze him like an orange. It’s no skin off me; I’ve done my job!“The ensuing silence was broken smoothly by Secretary General Douglashimself. .And a good job, too, Captain. Your advice will be weighed, and beassured that we will not do anything hastily. If this man, or manMartian,Smith, needs a few days to get adjusted, I’m sure that science can wait-sotake it easy, Pete. Let’s table this part of the discussion, gentlemen, and geton to other matters. Captain van Tromp is tired.“.One thing won’t wait,“ said the Minister for Public Information.\\n\\n 　　.Eh, Jock?“.If we don’t show the Man from Mars in the stereo tanks pretty shortly, you’llhave riots on your hands, Mr. Secretary.“.Hmm- You exaggerate, Jock. Mars stuff in the news, of course. Medecorating the captain and his brave crew-tomorrow, that had better be.\\n\\n 　　Captain van Tromp telling of his experiences-after a night’s rest of course,Captain.“The minister shook his head.\\n\\n 　　.No good, Jock?“.The public expected the expedition to bring back at least one real liveMartian for them to gawk at. Since they didn’t, we need Smith and need himbadly.“.’Live Martians?’“ Secretary General Douglas turned to Captain van Tromp.\\n\\n 　　.You have movies of Martians, haven’t you?“.Thousands of feet.“.There’s your answer, Jock. When the live stuff gets thin, trot on the moviesof Martians. The people will love it. Now, Captain, about this possibility ofextraterritoriality: you say the Martians were not opposed to it?“.Well, no, sir-but they were not for it, either.“.I don’t follow you?“Captain van Tromp chewed his lip. .Sir, I don’t know just how to explain it.\\n\\n 　　Talking with a Martian is something like talking with an echo. You don’t getany argument but you don’t get results either.“.Semantic difficulty? Perhaps you should have brought what’s-hisname, yoursemantician, with you today. Or is he waiting outside?“.Mahmoud, sir. No, Doctor Mahmoud is not well. A-a slight nervousbreakdown, sir.“ Van Tromp reflected that being dead drunk was the moralequivalent thereof.\\n\\n 　　.Space happy?“.A little, perhaps.“ These damned groundhogs!\\n\\n 　　.Well, fetch him around when he’s feeling himself. young man Smith shouldbe of help as an interpreter.“.Perhaps,“ van Tromp said doubtfully.\\n\\n 　　This young man Smith was busy at that moment just staying alive. His body,unbearably compressed and weakened by the strange shape of space in thisunbelievable place, was at last somewhat relieved by the softness of the nestin which these others had placed him. He dropped the effort of sustaining it,and turned his third level to his respiration and heart beat.\\n\\n 　　He saw at once that he was about to consume himself. His lungs werebeating almost as hard as they did at home, his heart was racing to distributethe influx, ail in an attempt to cope with the squeezing of space-and this in asituation in which he was smothered by a poisonously rich and dangerouslyhot atmosphere. He took immediate steps.\\n\\n 　　When his heart rate was down to twenty per minute and his respirationalmost imperceptible, he set them at that and watched himself long enoughto assure himself that he would not inadvertently discorporate while hisattention was elsewhere. When he was satisfied that they were runningproperly, he set a tiny portion of his second level on guard and withdrew therest of himself. It was necessary to review the configurations of these manynew events in order to fit them to himself, then cherish and praise them-lestthey swallow him up.\\n\\n 　　Where should he start? When he had left home, enfolding these others whowere now his own nestlings? Or simply at his arrival in this crushed space?\\n\\n 　　He was suddenly assaulted by the lights and sounds of that arrival, feeling itagain with mind-shaking pain. No, he was not yet ready to cherish andembrace that configuration-back! back! back beyond his first sight of theseothers who were now his own. Back even before the healing which hadfollowed his first grokking of the fact that he was not as his nestling brothers .\\n\\n 　　. . back to the nest itself.\\n\\n 　　None of his thinkings had been in Earth symbols. Simple English he hadfreshly learned to speak, but much less easily than a Hindu uses it to tradewith a Turk. Smith used English as one might use a code book, with tediousand imperfect translation for each symbol. Now his thoughts, pure Martianabstractions from half a million years of wildly alien culture, traveled so farfrom any human experience as to be utterly untranslatable.\\n\\n 　　In the adjoining room an intern, Dr. .Tad“ Thaddeus, was playing cribbagewith Tom Meechum, Smith’s special nurse. Thaddeus had one eye on hisdials and meters and both eyes on his cards; nevertheless he noted everyheart beat of his patient. When a flickering light changed from ninety-twopulsations per minute to less than twenty, he pushed the cards aside, jumpedto his feet, and hurried into Smith’s room with Meechum at his heels.\\n\\n 　　The patient floated in the flexible skin of the hydraulic bed. He appeared tobe dead. Thaddeus swore briefly and snapped, .Get Doctor Nelson!“Meechum said, .Yessir!“ and added, .How about the shock gear, Doc?\\n\\n 　　He’s far gone.“.Get Doctor Nelson!“The nurse rushed out. The interne examined the patient as closely aspossible but refrained from touching him. He was still doing so when an olderdoctor came in, walking with the labored awkwardness of a man long inspace and not yet adjusted to high gravity. .Well, Doctor?“.Patient’s respiration, temperature, and pulse dropped suddenly, uh, abouttwo minutes ago, sir.“.What have you done for him, or to him?“.Nothing, sir. Your instructions-.\\n\\n 　　.Good.“ Nelson looked Smith over briefly, then studied the instruments backof the bed, twins of those in the watch room. .Let me know if there is anychange.“ He started to leave.\\n\\n 　　Thaddeus looked startled. .But, Doctor-. He broke off.\\n\\n 　　Nelson said grimly, .Go ahead, Doctor. What is your diagnosis?“.Uh, I don’t wish to sound off about your patient, sir.“.Never mind. I asked for your diagnosis.“.Very well, sir. Shock-atypical, perhaps,“ he hedged, .but shock,leading to termination.“Nelson nodded. .Reasonable enough. But this isn’t a reasonable case.\\n\\n 　　Relax, son. I’ve seen this patient in this condition half a dozen times duringthe trip back. It doesn’t mean a thing. Watch.“ Nelson lifted the patient’s rightarm, let it go. It stayed where he had left it.\\n\\n 　　.Catalepsy?“ asked Thaddeus.\\n\\n 　　.Call it that if you like. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one. Don’t worryabout it, Doctor. There is nothing typical about this case. Just keep him frombeing bothered and call me if there is any change.“ He replaced Smith’s arm.\\n\\n 　　When Nelson had left, Thaddeus took one more look at the patient, shook hishead and joined Meechum in the watch room. Meechum picked up his cardsand said, .Crib?“.No.“Meechuin waited, then added, .Doc, if you ask me, that one in there is a casefor the basket before morning.“.No one asked you.“.My mistake.“.Go out and have a cigarette with the guards. I want to think.“Meechum shrugged and left. Thaddeus opened a bottom drawer, took out abottle and poured himself a dose intended to help his thinking. Meechumjoined the guards in the corridor; they straightened up, then saw who it wasand relaxed. The taller marine said, .Howdy, pal. What was the excitementjust now?“.Nothing much. The patient just had quintuplets and we were arguing aboutwhat to name them. Which one of you monkeys has got a butt? And a light?“The other marine dug a pack of cigarettes out of a pocket. .How’re you fixedfor Suction?“ he asked bleakly.\\n\\n 　　.Just middlin’. Thanks.“ Meechum stuck the cigarette in his face and talkedaround it. .Honest to God, gentlemen, I don’t know anything about thispatient. I wish I did.“.What’s the idea of these orders about .Absolutely No Women’? Is he somekind of a sex maniac?“.Not that I know of. All that I know is that they brought him in from theChampion and said that he was to have absolute quiet.“.’The Champion!’ .the first marine said. .Of course! That accounts for it.“.Accounts for what?“.It stands to reason. He ain’t had any, he ain’t seen any, he ain’t touchedany-for months. And he’s sick, see? If he was to lay hands on any, they’reafraid he’d kill hisself.“ He blinked and blew out a deep breath. .I’ll bet Iwould, under similar circumstances. No wonder they don’t want no bimsaround him.“Smith had been aware of the visit by the doctors but he had grokked at oncethat their intentions were benign; it was not necessary for the major part ofhim to be jerked back from where he was.\\n\\n 　　At the hour in the morning when human nurses slap patient’s faces with cold,wet cloths under the pretense of washing them, Smith returned from hisjourney. He speeded up his heart, increased his respiration, and again tooknote of his surroundings, viewing them with serenity. He looked the roomover, noting without discrimination and with praise all its details, bothimportant and unimportant. He was, in fact, seeing it for the first time, as hehad been incapable of enfolding it when he had been brought there the daybefore. This commonplace room was not commonplace to him; there wasnothing remotely like it on all Mars, nor did it resemble the wedge-shaPed~metal-walled compartments of the Champion. But, having relived the eventslinking his nest to this place, he was now prepared to accept it, commend it,and in some degree to cherish it.\\n\\n 　　He became aware that there was another living creature in the room withhim. A granddaddy longlegs was making a futile journey down from theceiling, spinning as it went. Smith watched it with delight and wondered if itwere a nestling form of man.\\n\\n 　　Doctor Archer Frame, the interne who had relieved Thaddeus, walked in atthat moment. .Good morning,“ he said. .How do you feel?“Smith turned the question over in his mind. The first phrase he recognized asa formal sound, requiring no answer but which could be repeated-or mightnot be. The second phrase was listed in his mind with several possibletranslations. If Doctor Nelson used it, it meant one thing; if Captain vanTromp used it, it was a formal sound, needing no reply.\\n\\n 　　He felt that dismay which so often overtook him in trying to communicate withthese creatures-a frightening sensation unknown to him before he met men.\\n\\n 　　But he forced his body to remain calm and risked an answer. .Feel good.“.Good!“ the creature echoed. .Doctor Nelson will be along in a minute. Feellike some breakfast?“All four symbols in the query were in Smith’s vocabulary but he had troublebelieving that he had heard them rightly. He knew that he was food, but hedid not .feel like“ food. Nor had he had any warning that he might be selectedfor such an honor. He had not known that the food supply was such that itwas necessary to reduce the corporate group. He was filled with mild regret,since there was still so much to grok of these new events, but no reluctance.\\n\\n 　　But he was excused from the effort of translating an answer by the entranceof Dr. Nelson. The ship’s doctor had had little rest and less sleep; he wastedno time on speech but inspected Smith and the array of dials in silence.\\n\\n 　　Then he turned to Smith. .Bowels move?“ he asked.\\n\\n 　　Smith understood this; Nelson always asked about it. .No, not yet.“.We’ll take care of that. But first you eat. Orderly, fetch in that tray.“Nelson fed him two or three bites, then required him to hold the spoon andfeed himself. It was tiring but gave him a feeling of gay triumph, for it was thefirst unassisted action he had taken since reaching this oddly distorted space.\\n\\n 　　He cleaned out the bowl and remembered to ask, .Who is this?“ so that hecould praise his benefactor.\\n\\n 　　.What is this, you mean,“ Nelson answered. .It’s a synthetic food jelly, basedon amino acids-and now you know as much as you did before. Finished? Allright, climb out of that bed.“.Beg pardon?“ It was an attention symbol which he had learned was usefulwhen communication failed.\\n\\n 　　.I said get out of there. Sit up. Stand up. Walk around. You can do it. Sure,you’re weak as a kitten but you’ll never put on muscle floating in that bed.“Nelson opened a valve at the head of the bed; water drained out. Smithrestrained a feeling of insecurity, knowing that Nelson cherished him. Shortlyhe lay on the floor of the bed with the watertight cover wrinkled around him.\\n\\n 　　Nelson added, .Doctor Frame, take his other elbow. We’ll have to help himand steady him.“With Dr. Nelson to encourage him and both of them to help him, Smith stoodup and stumbled over the rim of the bed. .Steady. Now stand up on yourown,“ Nelson directed. .Don’t be afraid. We’ll catch you if necessary.“He made the effort and stood alone-a slender young man withunderdeveloped muscles and overdeveloped chest. His hair had been cut inthe Champion and his whiskers removed and inhibited. His most markedfeature was his bland, expressionless, almost babyish face-set with eyeswhich would have seemed more at home in a man of ninety.\\n\\n 　　He stood alone for a moment, trembling slightly, then tried to walk. Hemanaged three shuffling steps and broke into a sunny, childlike smile. .Goodboy!“ Nelson applauded.\\n\\n 　　He tried another step, began to tremble violently and suddenly collapsed.\\n\\n 　　They barely managed to break his fall. .Damn!“ Nelson fumed. .He’s goneinto another one. Here, help me lift him into the bed. No-fill it first.“Frame did so, cutting off the flow when the cover skin floated six inches fromthe top. They lugged him into it, awkwardly because he had frozen into thefoetal position. .Get a collar pillow under his neck,“ instructed Nelson, .andcall me when he comes out of it. No-let me sleep, I need it. Unless somethingworries you. We’ll walk him again this afternoon and tomorrow we’ll startsystematic exercise. In three months I’ll have him swinging through the treeslike a monkey. There’s nothing really wrong with him.“.Yes, Doctor,“ Frame answered doubtfully.\\n\\n 　　.Oh, yes, when he comes out of it, teach him how to use the bathroom. Havethe nurse help you; I don’t Want him to fall.“.Yes, sir. Uh, any particular method-I mean, how-.\\n\\n 　　.Eh? Show him, of course! Demonstrate. He probably won’t understandmuch that you say to him, but he’s bright as a whip. He’ll be bathing himselfby the end of the week.“Smith ate lunch without help. Presently a male orderly came in to remove histray. The man glanced around, then came to the bed and leaned over him.\\n\\n 　　.Listen,“ he said in a low voice, .I’ve got a fat proposition for you.“.Beg pardon?“.A deal, a bargain, a way for you to make a lot of money fast and easy.“.’Money?’ What is .money’?“.Never mind the philosophy; everybody needs money. Now listen I’ll have totalk fast because I can’t stay in here long-and it’s taken a lot of fixing to getme in here at all. I represent Peerless Features. We’ll pay you sixty thousandfor your exclusive story and it won’t be a bit of trouble to you-we’ve got thebest ghost writers in the business. You just talk and answer questions; theyput it together.“ He whipped out a piece of paper. .Just read this and sign it.\\n\\n 　　I’ve got the down payment with me.“Smith accepted the paper, stared thoughtfully at it, holding it upside down.\\n\\n 　　The man looked at him and muffled an exclamation. .Lordyl Don’t you readEnglish?“Smith understood this well enough to answer. .No.“.Well- Here, I’ll read it to you, then you just put your thumb print in the squareand I’ll witness it. .I, the undersigned, Valentine Michael Smith, sometimesknown as the Man from Mars, do grant and assign to Peerless Features,Limited, all and exclusive rights in my true-fact story to be titled I Was aPrisoner on Mars in exchange for-.\\n\\n 　　.Orderly!“Dr. Frame was standing in the door of the watch room; the paperdisappeared into the man’s clothes. .Coming, sir. I was just getting this tray.“.What were you reading?“.Nothing.“.I saw you. Never mind, come out of there quickly. This patient is not to bedisturbed.“ The man obeyed; Dr. Frame closed the door behind them. Smithlay motionless for the next half hour, but try as he might he could not grok itat all.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/322.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
