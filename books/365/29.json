Three temporals-humans, he sawthey were; a man and two women-speculating about the eternal. Nothing oddabout that. .Yes?“.You heard what she said! The .Archangel Michael’ indeed!“.What about it?“.’What about it?’ Oh, for God’s sake!“.Very possibly.“Digby was so indignant that his halo quivered. .Foster, you must not havetaken a good look. She meant that over-age juvenile delinquent that sent meto the showers. Scan it again.“Foster let the gain increase, noted that the angel-in-training had spokenrightly-and noticed something else and smiled his angelic smile. .How do youknow he isn’t, Junior?“.Huh?“.I haven’t seen Mike around the Club lately and I recall that his name hasbeen scratched on the Millennial Solipsist Tournament-that’s a Sign that he’slikely away on detached duty, as Mike is one of the most eager Solipsismplayers in this sector.“.But the notion’s obscene!“.You’d be surprised how many of the Boss’s best ideas have been called.obscene’ in some quarters-or, rather, you should not be surprised, in view ofyour field work. But .obscene’ is a concept you don’t need; it has notheological meaning. .To the pure all things are pure.’“.But-.\n 　　.I’m still Witnessing, Junior. You listen. In addition to the fact that our brotherMichael seems to be away at this micro-instant-and I don’t keep track of him;we’re not on the same Watch list-that tattooed lady who made that oracularpronouncement is not likely to be mistaken; she’s a very holy temporalherself.“.Who says?“.I say. I know.“ Foster smiled again with angelic sweetness. Dear littlePatricia! Getting a little long in the tooth now but still Earthily desirable-andshining with an inner light that made her look like a stained glass window. Henoted without temporal pride that George had finished his great dedicationsince he had last looked at Patricia-and that picture of his being called up toHeaven wasn’t bad, not bad at all, in the Higher sense. He must remember tolook up George and compliment him on it, and tell him he had seen Patriciahnun,where was George? A creative artist in the universe design sectionworking right under the Architect, as he recalled-no matter, the master filewould dig him out in a split millennium.\n 　　What a delicious little butterball Patricia had been and such holy frenzy! Ifshe had had just a touch more assertiveness and a touch less humility hecould have made her a priestess. But such was Patricia’s need to acceptGod according to her own nature that she could have qualified only amongthe Lingayats . . . where she wasn’t needed. Foster considered scanningback and seeing her as she had been, decided against it with angelicrestraint; there was work to be done- .Forget the omniscio, Junior. I want aWord with you.“ Digby did so and waited. Foster twanged his halo, anannoying habit he had when he was meditating. .Junior, you aren’t shapingup too angelically.“.I’m sorry.“.Sorrow is not for eternity. But the Truth is you’ve been preoccupied with thatyoung fellow who may or may not be our brother Michael. Now wait- In thefirst place it is not for you to Judge the instrument used to call you from thepasture. In the second place it is not he who vexes you-you hardly knew himwhat’sbothering you is that little brunette secretary you had. She had earnedmy Kiss quite some temporal period before you were called. Hadn’t she?“.I was still testing her.“.Then no doubt you have been angelically pleased to note that SupremeBishop Short, after giving her a most thorough examination himself-oh, verythorough; I told you he would measure up-has passed her and she nowenjoys the wider Happiness she deserves. Mmmm, a shepherd should takejoy in his work . . . but when he’s promoted, he should take joy in that, too.\n 　　Now it just happens I know there is a spot open for a Guardian-in-Training ina new sector being opened up-a job under your nominal rank, I concede, butgood angelic experience. This planet-well, you can think of it as a planet;you’ll see-is occupied by a race of tripolaxity instead of bipolarity and I have iton High Authority that Don Juan himself could not manage to take Earthlyinterest in any of their three polarities . . . that’s not an opinion; he wasborrowed as a test. He screamed, and prayed to be returned to the solitaryhell he has created for himself.“.Going to send me out to Flatbush, huh? So I won’t interfere!“.Tut, tut! You can’t interfere-the one Impossibility that permits all else to bepossible; I tried to tell you that when you arrived. But don’t let it fret you; youare eternally permitted to try. Your orders will include a loop so that you willcheck back at here-now without any loss of temporality. Now fly away andget cracking; I have work to do.“ Foster turned back to where he had beeninterrupted. Oh, yes, a poor soul temporally designated as .Alice Douglas“-tobe a goad was a hard assignment at best and she had met it unflaggingly.\n 　　But her job was complete and now she would need rest and rehabilitationfrom the inescapable battle fatigue . . . she’d be kiclthig and screaming andfoaming ectoplasm at all orifices.\n 　　Oh, she would need a thorough exorcism after a job that rough! But theywere all rough; they couldn’t be anything else. And .Alice Douglas“ was anutterly reliable field operative; she could take any left-hand assignment aslong as it was essentially virginal-burn her at the stake or put her in anunnery; she always delivered.\n 　　Not that he cared much for virgins, other than with professional respect forany job well done. Foster sneaked a quick last look at Mrs. Paiwonski. Therewas a fellow worker he could appreciate. Darling little Patricia! What ablessed, lusty benison\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/347.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
