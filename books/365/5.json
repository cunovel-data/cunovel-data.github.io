{"id":32539,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"GILLIAN BOARDMAN WAS CONSIDERED professionally competent as anurse; she was judged competent in wider fields by the bachelor internes andshe was judged harshly by some other women. There was no harm in herand her hobby was men. When the grapevine carried the word that there wasa patient in special suite K-12 who had never laid eyes on a woman in hislife, she did not believe it. When detailed explanation convinced her, sheresolved to remedy it. She went on duty that day as floor supervisor in thewing where Smith was housed. As soon as possible she went to pay a call onthe strange patient.\n 　　She knew of the .No Female Visitors“ rule and, while she did not Considerherself to be a visitor of any sort, she sailed on past the marine guardswithout attempting to use the door they guarded-marines, she had found, hada stuffy habit of construing their orders literally. Instead she went into theadjacent watch room. Dr. .Tad“ Thaddeus was on duty there alone.\n 　　He looked up. .Well, if it ain’t .Dimples!’ Hi, honey, what brings you here?“She sat on the corner of his desk and reached for his cigarettes. .’MissDimples,’ to you, chum; I’m on duty. This call is part of my rounds. Whatabout your patient?“.Don’t worry your fuzzy head about him, honey chile; he’s not yourresponsibility. See your order book.“.I read it. I want to have a look at him.“.In one word-no.“.Oh, Tad, don’t go regulation on me. I know you.“He gazed thoughtfully at his nails. .Ever worked for Doctor Nelson?“.No. Why?“.If I let you put your little foot inside that door, I’d find myself in Antarcticaearly tomorrow, prescribing for penguins’ chilblains. So switch your fanny outof here and go bother your own patients. I wouldn’t want him even to catchyou in this watch room.“She stood up. .Is Doctor Nelson likely to come popping in?“.Not likely, unless I send for him. He’s still sleeping off low-gee fatigue.“.So? Then what’s the idea of being so duty struck?“.That’s all, Nurse.“.Very well, Doctor!“ She added, .Stinker.“.Jill!“.And a stuffed shirt, too.“He sighed. .Still okay for Saturday night?“She shrugged. .I suppose so. A girl can’t be fussy these days.“ She wentback to her duty station, found that her services were not in immediatedemand, picked up the pass key. She was balked but not beaten, as sherecalled that suite K- 12 had a door joining it to the room beyond it, a roomsometimes used as a sitting room when the suite was occupied by a VeryImportant Person. The room was not then in use, either as part of the suite orseparately. She let herself into it. The guards at the door beyond paid noattention, unaware that they had been flanked.\n 　　She hesitated at the inner door between the two rooms, feeling some of thesharp excitement she used to feel when sneaking out of student nurses’\n 　　quarters. But, she told herself, Dr. Nelson was asleep and Tad wouldn’t tellon her even if he caught her. She didn’t blame him for keeping his finger onhis number-but he wouldn’t report her. She unlocked the door and looked in.\n 　　The patient was in bed, he looked at her as the door opened. Her firstimpression was that here was a patient too far gone to care. His lack ofexpression seemed to show the complete apathy of the desperately ill. Thenshe saw that his eyes were alive with interest; she wondered if his face wereparalysed? No, she decided; the typical sags were lacking.\n 　　She assumed her professional manner. .Well, how are we today? Feelingbetter?“Smith translated and examined the questions. The inclusion of herself in thefirst query was confusing, but he decided that it might symbolize a wish tocherish and grow close. The second part matched Nelson’s speech forms.\n 　　.Yes,“ he answered.\n 　　.Good!“ Aside from his odd lack of expression she saw nothing strange abouthim-and if women were unknown to him, he was certainly managing toconceal it. .Is there anything I can do for you?“ She glanced around, notedthat there was no glass on the bedside shelf. .May I get you water?“Smith had spotted at once that this creature was different from the otherswho had come to see him. Almost as quickly he compared what he wasseeing with pictures Nelson had shown him on the trip from home to thisplace-pictures intended to explain a particularly difficult and puzzlingconfiguration of this people group. This, then, was a .woman.“He felt both oddly excited and disappointed. He suppressed both in order thathe might grok deeply, with such success that Dr. Thaddeus noticed nochange in the dial readings in the next room.\n 　　But when he translated the last query he felt such a surge of emotion that healmost let his heartbeat increase. He caught it in time and chided himself foran undisciplined nestling. Then he checked his translation.\n 　　No, he was not mistaken. This woman creature had offered him the waterritual. It wished to grow closer.\n 　　With great effort, scrambling for adequate meanings in his pitifully poor list ofhuman words, he attempted to answer with due ceremoniousness. .I thankyou for water. May you always drink deep.“Nurse Boardman looked startled. .Why, how sweetl“ She found a glass, filledit, and handed it to him.\n 　　He said, .You drink.“Wonder if he thinks I’m trying to poison him? she asked herself-but there wasa compelling quality to his request. She took a sip, whereupon he took theglass from her and took one also, after which he seemed content to sink backinto the bed, as if he had accomplished something important.\n 　　Jill told herself that, as an adventure, this was a fizzle. She said, .Well, if youdon’t need anything else, I must get on with my work.“She started for the door. He called out, .Not“She stopped. .Eh? What do you want’~“.Don’t go away.“.Well I have to go, pretty quickly.“ But she came back to the bedside, .Isthere anything you want?“He looked her up and down. .You are ... .woman’?“The question startled Jill Boardxnafl. Her sex had not been in doubt to themost casual observer for many years. Her first impulse was to answerflippantly.\n 　　But Smith’s grave face and oddly disturbing eyes checked her. She becameaware emotionallY that the impossible fact about this patient was true: he didnot know what a woman was. She answered carefully, .Yes, I am a woman.“Smith continued to stare at her without expression. Jill began to beembarrassed by it. To be looked at appreciativelY by a male she expectedand sometimes enjoyed, but this was more like being examined under amicroscope. She stirred restively. .Well? I look like a woman, don’t I?“.I do not know,“ Smith answered slowly. .How does woman look? Whatmakes you woman?“.Well, for pity’s sake!“ Jill realized confusedly that this conversation wasfurther out of hand than any she had had with a male since about her twelfthbirthday. .You don’t expect me to take off my clothes and show you!“Smith took time to examine these verbal symbols and try to translate them.\n 　　The first group he could not grok at all. It might be one of those formal soundgroups these people so often used . . . yet it had been spoken with surprisingforce, as if it might be a last communication before withdrawaL Perhaps hehad so deeply mistaken right conduct in dealing with a woman creature thatthe creature might be ready to discorporate at once.\n 　　He knew vaguely that he did not want the nurse to die at that moment, eventhough it was certainly its right and possibly its obligation to do so. Theabrupt change from the rapport of the Water ritual to a situation in which anewly won water brother might possibly be considering withdrawal ordiscorporatiOn would have thrown him into panic had he not beenconsciously suppressing such disturbance. But he decided that if Jill diednow he must die at once also-he could not grok it in any other wise, not afterthe giving of water.\n 　　The second half of the communication contained only symbols that he hadencountered before. He grokked imperfectly the intention but there seemedto be an implied way Out for him to avoid this crisis-by acceding to thesuggested wish. Perhaps if the woman took its clothes off neither of themneed discorporate. He smiled happily. .Please.“Jill opened her mouth, closed it hastily. She opened it again. .Huh? Well,I’ll be darned!“Smith could grok emotional violence and knew that somehow he had offeredthe wrong reply. He began to compose his mind for discorporation, savoringand cherishing all that he had been and seen, with especial attention to thiswoman creature. Then he became aware that the woman was bending overhim and he knew somehow that it was not about to die. It looked into hisface. .Correct me if I am wrong,“ it said, .but were you asking me to take myclothes off?“The inversions and abstractions required careful translation but Smithmanaged it. .Yes,“ he answered, while hoping that it would not stir up a newcrsis.\n 　　.That’s what I thought you said. Brother, you aren’t ill.“The word .brother“ he considered first-the woman was reminding him thatthey had been joined in the water ritual. He asked the help of his nestlingsthat he might measure up to whatever this new brotheT wanted. .I am not ill,“he agreed.\n 　　.Though I’m darned if I know how to cope with whatever is wrong with you.\n 　　But I won’t peel down. And I’ve got to get out of here.“ It straightened up andturned again toward the side door-then stopped and looked back with aquizzical smile. .You might ask me again, real prettily, under othercircumstances. I’m curious to see what I might do.“The woman was gone. Smith relaxed into the water bed and let the roomfade away from him. He felt sober triumph that he had somehow comfortedhimself so that it was not necessary for them to die . . . but there was muchnew to grok. The woman’s last speech had contained many symbols new tohim and those which were not new had been arranged in fashions not easilyunderstood. Out he was happy that the emotional flavor of them had beensuitable for communication between water brothers-although touched withsomething else both disturbing and terrifyingly pleasant. He thought about hisnew brother, the woman creature, and felt odd tingles run through him. Thefeeling reminded him of the first time he had been allowed to be present at adiscorporatiOn and he felt happy without knowing why.\n 　　He wished that his brother Doctor Mahmoud were here. There was so muchto grok, so little to grok from.\n 　　Jill Boardman spent the rest of her watch in a mild daze. She managed toavoid any mistakes in medication and she answered from reflex the usualverbal overtures made to her. But the face of the Man from Mars stayed inher mind and she mulled over the crazy things he had said. No, not .crazy,“she corrected-she had done her Stint ~fl psychiatric wards and she feltcertain that his remarks had not been psychotic.\n 　　She decided that .innocent“ was the proper term-then she decided that theword was not adequate. His expression was innocent, but his eyes were not.\n 　　What sort of creature had a face like that?\n 　　She had once worked in a Catholic hospital; she suddenly saw the face ofthe Man from Mars surrounded by the head dress of a nursing Sister, a nun.\n 　　The idea disturbed her, for there was nothing female about Smith’s face.\n 　　She was changing into Street clothes when another nurse stuck her headinto the locker room. .Phone, Jill. For you.“ Jill accepted the call, soundwithout vision, while she continued to dress.\n 　　.Is this Florence Nightingale?“ a baritone voice asked.\n 　　.Speaking. That you, Ben?“.The stalwart upholder of the freedom of the press in person. Little one,are you busy?“.What do you have in mind?“.I have in mind taking you out, buying you a bloody steak, plying you withliquor, and asking you a question.“.The answer is still .No.’\n 　　.Not that question. Another one.“.Oh, do you know another one? If so, tell me.“.Later. I want you softened up by food and liquor first.“.Real steak? Not syntho?“.Guaranteed. When you stick a fork into it, it will turn imploring eyes onyou.“.You must be on an expense account, Ben.“.That’s irrelevant and ignoble. How about it?“.You’ve talked me into it.“.The roof of the medical center. Ten minutes.“She put the street suit she had changed into back into her locker and put ona dinner dress kept there for emergencies. It was a demure little number,barely translucent and with bustle and bust pads so subdued that they merelyre-created the effect she would have produced had she been wearingnothing. The dress had cost her a month’s pay and did not look it, its subtlepower being concealed like knock-out drops in a drink. Jill looked at herselfwith satisfaction and took the bounce tube up to the roof.\n 　　There she pulled her cape around her against the wind and was looking forBen Caxton when the roof orderly touched her arm. .There is a car over therepaging you, Miss Boardman-that Talbot saloon.“.Thanks, Jack.“ She saw the taxi spotted for take-off, with its door open. Shewent to it, climbed in, and was about to hand Ben a backhanded complimenton gallantry when she saw that he was not inside. The taxi was on automatic;its door closed and it took to the air, swung Out of the circle, and slicedacross the Potomac. Jill sat back and waited.\n 　　The taxi stopped on a public landing flat over Alexandria and Ben Caxton gotin; it took off again. Jill looked him over grimly. .My, aren’t we gettingimportant! Since when has your time become so valuable that you send arobot to pick up your women?“He reached over, patted her knee, and said gently, .Reasons, little one,reasons-I can’t afford to be seen picking you up-.\n 　　.Welll“.-and you can’t afford to be seen being picked up by me. So simmer down. Iapologize. I bow in the dust. I kiss your little foot. But it was necessary.“.Hmm ... which one of us has leprosy?“.Both of us, in different ways. Jill, I’m a newspaperman.“.I was begimiing to think you were something else.“.And you are a nurse at the hospital where they are holding the Man fromMars.“ He spread his hands and shrugged.\n 　　.Keep talking. Does that make me unfit to meet your mother?“.Do you need a map, Jill? There are more than a thousand reporters in thisarea, not counting press agents, ax grinders, winchells, lippmanns, and thestampede that headed this way when the Champion landed. Every one ofthem has been trying to interview the Man from Mars, including me. So far asI know, none has succeeded. Do you think it would be Smart for us to beseen leaving the hospital together?“.Umm, maybe not. But I don’t really see that it matters. I’m not the Manfrom Mars.“He looked her over. .You certainly aren’t. But maybe you are going to helpme see him-which is why I didn’t want to be seen picking you.Huh? Ben, you’ve been out in the sun without your hat. They’ve got a marineguard around him.“ She thought about the fact that she herself had not foundthe guard too hard to circumvent, decided not to mention it.\n 　　.So they have. So we talk it over.“.I don’t see what there is to talk about.“.Later. I didn’t intend to let the subject come up until I had softened you withanimal proteins and ethanol. Let’s eat first.“.Now you sound rational. Where? Would your expense account run to theNew Mayflower? You are on an expense account, aren’t you?“Caxton frowned. .Jill, if we eat in a restaurant, I wouldn’t want to risk onecloser than Louisville. It would take this hack more than two hours to get usthat far. How about dinner in my apartment?“.’-Said the Spider to the Fly.’ Ben, I remember the last time. I’m too tired towrestle.“.Nobody asked you to. Strictly business. King’s X, cross my heart andhope to die.“.I don’t know as I like that much better. If I’m safe alone with you, I must beslipping. Well, all right, King’s X.“Caxton leaned forward and punched buttons; the taxi, which had beencircling under a .hold“ instruction, woke up, looked around, and headed forthe apartment hotel where Ben lived. He then dialed a phone number andsaid to Jill, .How much time do you want to get liquored up, sugar foot? I’ll tellthe kitchen when to have the steaks ready.“Jill considered it. .Ben, your mousetrap has a private kitchen.“.Of sorts. I can grill a steak, if that is what you mean.“.I’ll grill the steak. Hand me the phone.“ She gave orders, stopping to makesure that Ben liked endive.\n 　　The taxi dropped them on the roof and they went down to his flat. It wasunstylish and old-fashioned; its one luxury was a live grass lawn in the livingroom. Jill stopped in the entrance hail, slipped off her shoes, then steppedbare-footed into the living room and wiggled her toes among the cool greenblades. She sighed. .My, that feels good. My feet have hurt ever since Ientered training.“.Sit down.“.No, I want my feet to remember this tomorrow, when I’m on duty.“.Suit yourself.“ He went into his pantry and mixed drinks.\n 　　Presently she pattered after him and became domestic. The steak waswaiting in the package lift; with it were pre-baked potatoes ready to bepopped into short-wave. She tossed the salad, handed it to the refrigerator,then set up a combination on the stove to grill the steak and have thepotatoes hot simultaneously, but did not start the cycle. .Ben, doesn’t thisstove have a remote control?“.Of course.“.Well, I can’t find it.“He studied the setup on the control panel, then flipped an unmarked switch.\n 　　.Jill, what would you do if you had to cook over an open fire?“.I’d do darn well. I was a Girl Scout and a good one. How about you,smarty?“He ignored it, picked up a tray and went back to the living room; she followedand sat down at his feet, spreading her skirt to avoid grass stains. Theyapplied themselves seriously to martinis. Opposite his chair was astereovision tank disguised as an aquarium; he switched it on from his chair,guppies and tetras faded out and gave way to the face of a commentator, thewell-known winchell Augustus Greaves.\n 　　.-it can be stated authoritatively,“ the stereo image was saying, .that the Manfrom Mars is being kept constantly under hypnotic drugs to keep him fromdisclosing these facts. The administration would find it extremelyembarrassing if-.\n 　　Canon flipped it off. .Gus old boy,“ he said pleasantly, .you don’t know a durnthing more about it than I do.“ He frowned. .Though you might be right aboutthe government keeping him under drugs.“.No, they aren’t,“ Jill said suddenly.\n 　　.Eh? How’s that, little one?“.The Man from Mars isn’t being kept under hypnotics.“ Having blurted morethan she had meant to, she added carefully, .He’s got a nurse and a doctorall to himself on continuous watch, but there aren’t any orders for sedation.“.Are you sure? You aren’t one of his nurses-or are you?“.No. They’re male nurses. Uh ... matter of fact, there’s an order to keepwomen away from him entirely and a couple of tough marines to make sureof it.“Caxton nodded. .I heard about that. Fact is, you don’t know whether they aredrugging him or not. Do you?“Jill stared into her empty glass. She felt annoyed to have her word doubtedbut realized she would have to tell on herself to back up what she had said.\n 　　.Ben? You wouldn’t give me away? Would you?“.Give you away? How?“.Any way at all.“.Hmm ... that covers a lot of ground, but I’ll go along.“.All right. Pour me another one first.“ He did so, Jill went on. .I know theydon’t have the Man from Mars hopped up-because I talked with him.“Caxton gave a slow whistle. .I knew it. When I got up this morning I said tomyself, .Go see Jill. She’s the ace up my sleeve.’ Honey lamb, have anotherdrink. Have six. Here, take the pitcher.“.Not so fast, thanks.“.Whatever you like. May I rub your poor tired feet? Lady, you are about to beinterviewed. Your public waits with quivering impatience. Now let’s begin atthe beginning. How-.\n 　　.No, Ben! You promised-remember? You quote me just one little quoteand I’ll lose my job.“.Mmm ... probably. How about .from a usually reliable source’?“.I’d be scared.“.Well? Are you going to tell Uncle Ben? Or are you going to let him die offrustration and then eat that steak by yourself?“.Oh, I’ll talk-now that I’ve talked this much. But you can’t use it.“ Ben keptquiet and did not press his luck; Jill described how she had outflanked theguards.\n 　　He interrupted. .Say! Could you do that again?“.Huh? I suppose so, but I won’t. It’s risky.“.Well, could you slip me in that way? Of course you could! Look, I’ll dress uplike an electrician-greasy coveralls, union badge, tool kit. You just slip me thepass key and-.\n 　　.No!“.Huh? Look, baby girl, be reasonable. I’ll bet you four to one that half thehospital staffers around him are ringers, stuck in there by one news serviceor another. This is the greatest human-interest story since Colombo connedIsabella into hocking her jewels. The only thing that worries me is that I mayfind another phony electrician-.\n 　　.The only thing that worries me is me,“ Jill interrupted. .To you it’s just astory; to me it’s my career. They’d take away my cap, my pin, and ride me outof town on a rail. I’d be finished as a nurse.“.Mmm ... there’s that.“.There sure is that.“.Lady, you are about to be offered a bribe.“.How big a bribe? It’ll take quite a chunk to keep me in style the rest of mylife in Rio.“.Well ... the story is worth money, of course, but you can’t expect me tooutbid Associated Press, or Reuters. How about a hundred?“.What do you think I am?“.We settled that, we’re dickering over the price. A hundred and fifty?“.Pour me another drink and look up the phone number of Associated Pressfor me, that’s a lamb.“.It’s Capitol 10-9000. Jill, will you marry me? That’s as high as I canShe looked up at him, startled. .What did you say?“.Will you marry me? Then, when they ride you out of town on a rail, I’ll bewaiting at the city line and take you away from your sordid existence. You’llcome back here and cool your toes in my grass-our grass- and forget yourignominy. But you’ve durn well got to sneak me into that hospital room first.“.Ben, you almost sound serious. If I phone for a Fair Witness, will yourepeat the offer?“Caxton sighed. .Jill, you’re a hard woman. Send for a Witness.“She stood up. .Ben,“ she said softly, .I won’t hold you to it.“ She rumpled hishair and kissed him. .But don’t ever joke about marriage to a spinster.“.I wasn’t joking.“.I wonder. Wipe off the lipstick and I’ll tell you everything I know, then we’llconsider how you can use it without getting me ridden on that rail. Fairenough?“.Fair enough.“She gave him a detailed account. .I’m sure he wasn’t drugged. I’m equallysure that he was rational-although why I’m sure I don’t know, for he talked inthe oddest fashion and asked the darnedest questions. But I’m sure. He isn’tpsychotic.“.It would be odder still if he hadn’t talked in an odd fashion.“.Huh?“.Use your head, Jill. We don’t know much about Mars but we do know thatMars is very unlike Earth and that Martians, whatever they are, certainly arenot human. Suppose you were suddenly popped into a tribe so far back inthe jungle that they had never laid eyes on a white woman. Would you knowall the sophisticated small talk that comes from a lifetime in a culture? Orwould your conversation sound odd? That’s a very mild analogy; the truth inthis case is at least forty million miles stranger.“Jill nodded. .I figured that out ... and that is why I discounted his oddremarks. I’m not dumb.“.No, you’re real bright, for a female.“.Would you like this martini poured in your thinning hair?“.I apologize. Women are lots smarter than men; that is proved by our wholecultural setup. Gimme, I’ll fill it.“She accepted the peace offerings and went on, .Ben, that order about notletting him see women, it’s silly. He’s no sex fiend.“.No doubt they don’t want to hand him too many shocks at once.“.He wasn’t shocked. He was just ... interested. It wasn’t like having a manlook at me at all.“.If you had humored him on that request for a private viewing, you mighthave had your hands full. He probably has all the instincts and no inhibitions.“.Huh? I don’t think so. I suppose they’ve told him about male and female; hejust wanted to see how women are different.“.’Vive Ia difference!’“ Caxton answered enthusiastically.\n 　　.Don’t be more vulgar than you have to be.“.Me? I wasn’t being vulgar, I was being reverent. I was giving thanks to allthe gods that I was born human and not Martian.“.Be serious.“.I was never more serious.“.Then be quiet. He wouldn’t have given me any trouble. He would probablyhave thanked me gravely. You didn’t see his face-I did.“.What about his face?“Jill looked puzzled. .I don’t know how to express it. Yes, I do!-Ben, have youever seen an angel?“.You, cherub. Otherwise not.“.Well, neither have I-but that is what he looked like. He had old, wise eyes ina completely placid face, a face of unearthly innocence.“ She shivered.\n 　　.’Unearthly’ is surely the right word,“ Ben answered slowly. .I’d like to seehim.“.I wish you had. Ben, why are they making such a thing out of keeping himshut up? He wouldn’t hurt a fly. I’m sure of it.“Caxton fitted his fingertips together. .Well, in the first place they want toprotect him. He grew up in Mars gravity; he’s probably weak as a cat.“.Yes, of course. You could see it, just looking at him. But muscular weaknessisn’t dangerous; myasthenia gravis is much worse and we manage all rightwith such cases.“.They would want to keep him from catching things, too. He’s like thoseexperimental animals at Notre Dame; he’s never been exposed.“.Sure, sure-no antibodies. But from what I hear around the mess hail, DoctorNelson-the surgeon in the Champion, I mean-Doctor Nelson took care of thaton the trip back. Repeated mutual transfusion until he had replaced abouthalf of his blood tissue.“.Really? Can I use that, Jill? That’s news.“.All right, just don’t quote me. They gave him shots for everything buthousemaid’s knee, too. But, Ben, even if they want to protect him frominfection, that doesn’t take armed guards outside his door.“.Mmmm ... Jill, I’ve picked up a few tidbits you may not know. I haven’t beenable to use them because I’ve got to protect my sources, just as with you. ButI’ll tell you; you’ve earned it-just don’t talk.“.Oh, I won’t.“.It’s a long story. Want a refill?“.No, let’s start the steak. Where’s the button?“.Right here.“.Well, push it.“.Me? You offered to cook dinner. Where’s that Girl Scout spirit you wereboasting about?“.Ben Caxton, I will lie right here in the grass and starve before I will get up topush a button that is six inches from your right forefinger.“.As you wish.“ He pressed the button to tell the stove to carry out its pre.setorders. .But don’t forget who cooked dinner. Now about Valentine MichaelSmith. In the first place there is grave doubt as to his right to the name.Smith.’“.Repeat, please?“.Honey, your pal appears to be the first interplanetary bastard of record. Imean .love child.’“.The hell you say!“.Please be more ladylike in your speech. Do you remember anything aboutthe crew of the Envoy? Never mind, I’ll hit the high points. Eight people, fourmarried couples. Two couples were Captain and Mrs. Brant, Doctor and Mrs.\n 　　Smith. Your friend with the face of an angel appears to be the son of Mrs.\n 　　Smith by Captain Brant.“.How do they know? And, anyhow, who cares?“ Jill sat up and saidindignantly, .It’s a pretty snivelin’ thing to dig up a scandal after all this time.\n 　　They’re all dead-let .em alone, I say!“.As to how they know, you can figure that out. Blood typing, Rh factor, hairand eye color, all those genetic things-you probably know more about themthan I do. Anyhow it is a mathematical certainty that Mary Jane Lyle Smithwas his mother and Captain Michael Brant was his father. All the factors arematters of record for the entire crew of the Envoy; there probably never wereeight people more thoroughly measured and typed. Also it gives ValentineMichael Smith a wonderfully fine heredity; his father had an I.Q. of 163, hismother 170, and both were tops in their fields.\n 　　.As to who cares,“ Ben went on, .a lot of people care very much- and a lotmore will care, once this picture shapes up. Ever heard of the Lyle Drive?“.Of course. That’s what the Champion used.“.And every other space ship, these days. Who invented it?“.I don’t-Wait a minute! You mean she-.\n 　　.Hand the little lady a cigar! Dr. Mary Jane Lyle Smith. She knew she hadsomething important, even though development work remained to be doneon it. So before she left on the expedition, she applied for a dozenodd basicpatents and placed it all in a corporate trust-not a non-profit corporation, mindyou-then assigned control and interim income to the Science Foundation. Soeventually the government got control of it-but your friend with the face of anangel owns it. No possible doubt. It’s worth millions, maybe hundreds ofmillions; I couldn’t guess.“They brought in dinner. Caston used ceiling tables to protect his lawn; helowered one down in front of his chair and another to Japanese height so thatJill could sit on the grass. .Tender?“ he asked.\n 　　.Ongerful!“ she answered with her mouth full.\n 　　.Thanks. Remember, I cooked it.“.Ben,“ she said after swallowing, .how about Smith being a-I mean, beingillegitimate? Can he inherit?“.He’s not illegitimate. Doctor Mary Jane was at Berkeley, and California lawsdeny the concept of bastardy. Same for Captain Brant, as New Zealand alsohas civilized laws on the subject. While under the laws of the home State ofDoctor Ward Smith, Mary Jane’s husband, a child born in wedlock islegitimate, come hell or high water. We have here. Jill, a man who is theSimon-pure legitimate child of three different parents.\n 　　.Huh? Now wait a minute, Ben; he can’t be it both ways. One or the other butnot both. I’m not a lawyer but-.\n 　　.You sure ain’t. Such legal fictions bother a lawyer not at all. Smith islegitimate different ways in different jurisdictions, all kosher and all breakinghis way-even though he is probably a bastard in his physical ancestry. So heinherits. Besides that, while his mother was wealthy, both his fathers were atleast well to do. Brant was a bachelor until just before the expedition; he hadploughed most of his scandalous salary as a pilot on the Moon run back intoLunar Enterprises, Limited. You know how that stuff has boomed-they justdeclared another three-way stock dividend. Brant had one vice, gambling-butthe bloke won regularly and invested that, too. Ward Smith had familymoney; he was a medical man and scientist by choice. Smith is heir to bothof them.“.Whew!“.That ain’t half, honey. Smith is heir to the entire crew.“.Huh?“.All eight signed a .Gentlemen Adventurers’ contract, making them allmutually heirs to each other-all of them and their issue. They did it with greatcare, using as models similar contracts in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies that had stood up against every effort to break them. Now thesewere all high-powered people; among them they had quite a lot. Happened toinclude considerable Lunar Enterprises stock, too, besides what Brant held.\n 　　Smith might turn out to own a controlling interest, or at least a key bloc in aproxy fight.“Jill thought about the childlike creature who had made such a touchingceremony out of just a drink of water and felt sorry for him. But Caxton wenton: .I wish I could sneak a look at the Envoy’s log. I know they recovered itbutI doubt if they’ll ever release it.“.Why not, Ben?“.Because it’s a nasty story. I got Just enough to be sure before my informantsobered up and clammed up. Dr. Ward Smith delivered his wife of child byCaesarian section-and she died on the table. He seems to have worn hishorns complacently until then. But what he did next shows that he knew thescore; with the same scalpel he cut Captain Brant’s throat- then cut his own.\n 　　Sorry, hon.“Jill shivered. .I’m a nurse. I’m immune to such things.“.You’re a liar and I love you for it. I was on police beat for three years, Jill; Inever got hardened to it.“.What happened to the others?“.I wish I knew. If we don’t break the bureaucrats and high brass loose fromthat log, we’ll never know-and I am enough of a starry-eyed newsboy to thinkwe should know. Secrecy begets tyranny.“.Ben, he might be better off if they gypped him out of his inheritance. He’svery . . . uh, unworldly.“.The exact word, I’m sure. Nor does he need all that money; the Man fromMars will never miss a meal. Any of the governments and any of a thousand-odd universities and scientific institutions would be delighted to have him as apermanent, privileged guest.“.He’d better sign it over and forget it.“.It’s not that easy. Jill, you know about the famous case of General Atomicsversus Larkin, et al?“.Uh, not really. You mean the Larkin Decision. I had to study it in school,same as everybody. But what’s it got to do with Smith?“.Think back. The Russians sent the first rocket to the Moon, it crashed. TheUnited States and Canada combine to send another one; it gets back butleaves nobody on the Moon. So when the United States and theCommonwealth are getting set to send a colonizing one jointly under thenominal sponsorship of the Federation and Russia is mounting the same dealon their own, General Atomics steals a march by sending one of their ownfrom an island leased from Ecuador-and their men are still there, sitting prettyand looking smug when the Federation vessel shows up . . . followed by theRussian one.\n 　　.You know what happened. General Atomics, a Swiss corporation Americancontrolled, claimed the Moon. The Federation couldn’t just brush them off;that would have been too raw and anyhow the Russians wouldn’t have heldstill. So the High Court ruled that a corporate person, a mere legal fiction,could not own a planet; therefore the real owners were the flesh-and-bloodmen who had maintained the occupation-Larkin and associates. So theyrecognized them as a sovereign nation and took them into the Federationwithsome melon slicing for those on the inside and fat concessions toGeneral Atomics and its daughter corporation, Lunar Enterprises. This didnot entirely suit anybody and the Federation High Court was not all powerfulin those days-but it was a compromise everybody could swallow. It resultedin some tight rules for colonizing planets, all based on the Larkin Decisionand intended to avoid bloodshed. Worked, too-it’s a matter of history thatWorld War Three did not result from conflict over space travel and such. Sonow the Larkin Decision is solidly a part of our planetary law and applies toSmith.“Jill shook her head. .I don’t see the connection. Martinis-.\n 　　.Think, Jill. By our laws, Smith is a sovereign nation in himself-and soleowner of the planet Mars.“\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/323.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
