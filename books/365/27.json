{"id":32561,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"IT WAS THE USUAL SORT OF CARNIVAL in the usual sort of town. Therides were the same, the cotton candy tasted the same, the flat jointspracticed a degree of moderation acceptable to the local law in separatingthe marks from their half dollars, whether with baseballs thrown at targets,with wheels of fortune, or what-but the separation took place just the same.\n 　　The sex lecture was trimmed to suit local opinions concerning CharlesDarwin’s opinions, the girls in the posing show wore that amount of gauzethat local mores required, and the Fearless Fentons did their Death-Defying(in sober truth) Double Dive just before the last bally each night.\n 　　The ten-in-one show was equally standard. It did not have a mentalist, it didhave a magician; it did not have a bearded lady, it did have a half-man halfwoman;it did not have a sword swallower, it did have a fire eater. In place ofa tattooed man the show had a tattooed lady who was also a snake channerandfor the blow-off (at another half dollar per mark) she appeared.absolutely nude! .. clothed only in bare living flesh in exotic designs!“-andany mark who could find one square inch below her neckline untattooedwould be awarded a twenty dollar bill.\n 　　That twenty dollars had gone unclaimed all season, because the blowoff washonestly ballyhooed. Mrs. Paiwonski stood perfectly still and completelyunclothed-other than in .bare, living flesh“ ... in this case a fourteen-foot boaconstrictor known as .Honey Bun.“ Honey Bun was looped around Mrs. P. sostrategically that even the local ministerial alliance could find no real excuseto complain, especially as some of their own daughters wore not nearly asmuch and covered still less while attending the carnival. To keep the placid,docile Honey Bun from being disturbed, Mrs. P. took the precaution ofstanding on a small platform in the middle of a canvas tank-on the floor ofwhich were more than a dozen cobras.\n 　　The occasional drunk who was certain that all snake charmer’s snakes weredefanged and so tried to climb into the tank in pursuit of that undecoratedsquare inch invariably changed his opinion as soon as a cobra noticed him,lifted and spread its hood.\n 　　Besides, the lighting wasn’t very good.\n 　　However, the drunk could not have won the twenty dollars in any case. Mrs.\n 　　P’s claim was much sounder than the dollar. She and her late husband hadhad for many years a tattooing studio in San Pedro; when trade was slackthey had decorated each other-and, eventually, at some minor inconvenienceto herself, the art work on her was so definitively complete from her neckdown that there was no possible room for an encore. She took great prideboth in the fact that she was the most completely decorated woman in theworld (and by the world’s greatest artist, for such was her humbly gratefulopinion of her late husband) and also in the certainty that every dollar sheearned was honest.\n 　　She associated with grifters and sinners and did not hold herself aloof fromthem. But her own integrity was untouched. She and her husband had beenconverted by Foster himself, she kept her membershiP in San Pedro andattended services at the nearest branch of the Church of the New Revelationno matter where she was.\n 　　Patricia Paiwoush would gladly have dispensed with the protection of HoneyBun in the blow-off not merely to prove that she was honest (that needed noproof, since she knew it was true) but because she was serene in herconviCtiOn that she was the canvas for religiouS art greater than any on thewalls or ceilings of the Vatican. When she and George had seen the light.\n 　　there was still about three square feet of Patricia untouched before he diedshe carried a complete pictorial life of Foster, from his crib with the angelShovering around to the day of glory when he had taken his appointed placeamong the archangels.\n 　　Regrettably (since it might have turned many sinners into seekers of the light)much of this sacred history bad to be covered up. the amount depending onthe local lawmen. But she could show it in closed Happiness ~eetiflgS of thelocal churches she attended, if the shepherd wanted her to, which he almostalways did. But, while it was always good to add to Happiness~ the saved didnot need it; Patricia would rather have saved sinners. She couldn’t preach.\n 　　she couldn’t sing, and she had never been called to speak in tongues__butshe was a living witness to the light.\n 　　In the ten-in-One, her act came next to last, just before the magician; thisgave her time to put away unsold photograPhs of herself (a quarter for black\u0026 white, half a dollar in color, a set of special photograPhs for five dollars in asealed envelope sold only to marks who signed a printed form alleging thatthey were doctors of medicine, psychology, sociology, or other such entitledto professional material not available to the general public-and such wasPatricia’s integrity that she would not sell these even for ten dollars if themark did not look the part; she would then ask to see his business card - nodirty dollars were going to put her kids through school-and also gave her timeto slip behind the rear canvas and get herself and her snakes ready for theblOW-Off.\n 　　The magician, Dr. Apollo, performed on the last platform nearest to thecanvas fly leading to the blow-Off. He started by passing out to his audiencea dozen shiny steel rings, each as wide as a plate; he invited them toconvince themselves that each ring was solid and smooth. Then he bad themhold the rings so that they overlapped. Dr. Apollo walked along the platform~reached out with his wand and tapped each overlap-the solid steel linksformed a chain.\n 　　Casually he laid his wand in the air, rolled up his sleeves, accepted a bowl ofeggs from his 5ssistant, and started to juggle half a dozen of them. Hisjuggling did not attract too many eyes; his assistant was more worthy ofstares. She was a fine example of modern functional design and, while shewore a great deal more than did the young ladies in the posing show,nevertheless there seemed to be a strong probability that she was nottattooed anywhere. The marks hardly noticed it when the six eggs becameeve, then four three, two—until at last Dr. Apollo was tossing one egg in theair, with his sleeves still rolled up and a puzzled look on his faceAt last hesaid, .Eggs are getting scarcer every year,“ and tossed the remaining eggover the heads of those nearest the platform to a man in the back of thecrowd. .Catch!“He turned away and did not seem to notice that the egg never reached itsdestination.\n 　　Dr. Apollo performed several other tricks, while wearing always the sameslightly puzzled expression and with the same indifferent patter. Once hecalled a young boy close to the platform. .Son, I can tell you what you arethinking. You think I’m not a real magician. And you’re right~ For that you wina dollar.“ He handed the kid a dollar bill. It disappeared.\n 　　The magician looked unhappy. .Dropped it? Well, hang on to this one.“ Asecond bill disappeared.\n 　　.Oh, dear. Well, we’ll have to give you one more chance. Use both hands.\n 　　Got it? All right, better get out of here fast with it-YOU should be home in bedanyhow.“ The kid dashed away with the money and the magician turned backand again looked puzzled .Madame Merlin, what should we do now?“His pretty assistant came up to him, pulled his head down by one ear,whispered into it. He shook his head. .No, not in front of all these people.“She whispered again; he looked distressed. .I’m sorry, friends, but MadameMerlin insists that she wants to go tobed. Will any of you gentlemen helpher?“He blinked at the rush of volunteers- .Oh, just two of you. Were any of yougentlemen in the Army?“There were still more than enough volunteers. Dr. Apollo picked two andsaid, .There’s an army cot under the end of the platforms just lift up thecanvas_flow, will you set it up for her here on the platform? Madame Merlin,face this way, please.“While the two men set up the cot, Dr. Apollo made passes in the air at hisassistant. .Sleep ... sleep . . you are now asleep. Friends, she is in a deeptrance. Will you two gentlemen who so kindly prepared her bed now placeher on it? One take her head, one take her feet. Careful, now-. In corpselikerigidity the girl was transferred to the cot.\n 　　.Thank you, gentlemen. But we ought not to leave her uncovered, shouldwe? There was a sheet here, somewhere. Oh, there it is.“ The magicianreached out, recovered his wand from where he had parked it, pointed to atable laden with props at the far end of his platform; a sheet detached itselffrom the pile and came to him. .Just spread this over her. Cover her head,too; a lady should not be exposed to public gaze while sleeping. Thank you.\n 　　Now if you will just step down off the platform. Fine! Madame Merlin . . . canyou hear me?“.Yes, Doctor Apollo.“.You were heavy with sleep. Now you are resting. You feel lighter, muchlighter. You are sleeping on a bed of clouds. You are floating away onclouds-. The sheet-covered form raised slowly up about a foot. .Wups! Don’tget too light. We don’t want to lose you.“In the crowd, a boy in his late teens explained in a loud whisper, .She’s notunder the sheet now. When they put the sheet over her, she went downthrough a trap door. That’s just a light framework, doesn’t weigh as much asthe sheet. And in a minute he’ll flip the sheet away and while he does, theframework will collapse and disappear. It’s just a gimmick—anybody could doit,“Dr. Apollo ignored him and went on talking. .A little higher, Madame Merlin.\n 　　Higher. There-. The draped form floated about six feet above the platform.\n 　　The smart youngster whispered to his friends, .There’s a slender steel rodbut you can’t see it too easily. It’s probably where one corner of the sheethangs down there and touches the cot.“Dr. Apollo turned and requested his volunteers to remove the cot and put itback under the platform. .She doesn’t need it now. She sleeps on clouds.“He faced the floating form and appeared to be listening. .What? Louder,please. Oh? She says that she doesn’t want the sheet-it’s too heavy.“(.Here’s where the framework disappears.“)The magician tugged one corner of the sheet, snatched it away; the audiencehardly noticed that the sheet disappeared without his bothering to gather it in;they were looking at Madame Merlin, still floating, still sleeping, six feetabove the platform. The platform stood in the middle rear of the tent and theaudience surrounded it on all sides. A companion of the boy who knew allabout stage magic said, .Okay, Speedy, where’s the steel rod?“The kid said uncertainly, .You have to look where he doesn’t want you tolook, it’s the way they’ve got those lights fixed to shine right into your eyes.“Dr. Apollo said, .That’s enough sleep, fairy princess. Give me your hand.\n 　　Wake up, wake up!“ He took her hand, pulled her erect and helped her stepdown to the platform.\n 　　(.You see? You saw how stiff she got down, you saw where she put her foot?\n 　　That’s where the steel rod went.“ The kid added with satisfaction, .Just agimmick.“)The magician went on talking, .And now friends, if you will kindly give yourattention to our learned lecturer, Professor Timoshenko-.\n 　　The talker cut in at once. .Don’t go .way! For this one performance only byarrangement with the Council of Colleges and Universities and with thepermission of the Department of Safety and Welfare of this wonderful city, weare offering this twenty dollar bill absolutely free to any one of you-.\n 　　Most of the tip was turned into the blow-off. A few wandered around, thenstarted to leave as most of the lights in the main tent were turned off. Thefreaks and other carnies started packing their props and slum preparatory totear-down. There was a train jump coming in the morning and living topswould remain up for a few hours sleep, but canvas boys were alreadyloosening stakes on the sideshow top.\n 　　Shortly the talker-owner-manager of the ten-in-one came back into the semidarkenedtent, having rushed the blow-off and spilled the last marks out therear exit. .Smitty, don’t go .way. Got something for you.“ He handed themagician an envelope, which Dr. Apollo tucked away without looking at it.\n 　　The manager added, .Kid, I hate to tell you this-but you and your wife ain’tgoing with us to Paducah.“.I know.“.Well ... look, don’t take it hard, there’s nothing personal about it -but I got tothink of the show. We’re replacing you with a mentalist team. They do a topreading act, then she runs a phrenology and mitt camp while he makes withthe mad ball. We need .em . . . and you know as well as I do you didn’t haveno season’s guarantee. You were just on trial.“.I know,“ agreed the magician. .I knew it was time to leave. No hardfeelings, Tim.“.Well, I’m glad you feel that way about it.“ The talker hesitated. .Smitty, doyou want some advice? Just say no if you don’t.“.I would like very much to have your advice,“ the magician said simply.\n 　　.Okay, you asked for it. Smitty, your tricks are good. Hell, some of .em evengot me baffled. But clever tricks don’t make a magician. The trouble is you’renot really with it. You behave like a carney-you mind your own business andyou never crab anybody else’s act and you’re helpful if anybody needs it. Butyou’re not a carney. You know why? You don’t have any feeling for whatmakes a chump a chump; you don’t get inside his mind. A real magician canmake the marks open their mouths and catch flies just by picking a quarterout of the air. That Thurston’s levitation you do-I’ve never seen it done anymore perfectly but the marks don’t warm to it. No psychology. Now take me,for example. I can’t even pick a quarter out of the air-hell, I can barely use aknife and fork without cutting my mouth. I got no act . . . except I got the oneact that counts. I know marks. I know where that streak of larceny is in hisheart, I know just how wide it is. I know what he hungers for, whether heknows it or not. That’s showmanship, son, whether you’re a politician runningfor office, a preacher pounding a pulpit . . . or a magician. You find out whatthe chumps want and you can leave half your props in your trunk.“.I’m sure you’re right.“.I know I am. He wants sex and blood and money. We don’t give him any realblood-unless a fire eater or a knife thrower makes a terrible mistake. Wedon’t give him money, either; we just encourage him to hope for it while wetake away a little. We don’t give him any real sex. But why do seven out often of a tip buy the blow-off? To see a nekkid broad, that’s why-and a chanceto be paid a double sawbuck for lookin’-when maybe they got one just asgood or better at home, nekkid anytime they like. So he don’t see one and hedon’t get paid-and sill we send him out happy.\n 　　.What else does a chump want? Mystery! He wants to think that the world isa romantic place when he knows damn well it ain’t. That’s your job . . . onlyyou ain’t learned how. Shucks, son, even the marks know that your tricks arefake . . . only they’d like to believe they’re real, and it’s up to you to help .embelieve, as long as they’re inside the show. That’s what you lack.“.How do I get it, Tim? How do I learn what makes a chump tick?“.Hell, I can’t tell you that; that’s the piece you have to learn for yourself. Getout and stir around and be a chump yourself a while, maybe. But- Well, takethis notion you had of billing yourself as .The Man from Mars.’ You mustn’toffer the chump what he won’t swallow. They’ve all seen the Man from Mars,in pictures and on stereovision. Hell, I’ve seen him myself. Sure, you look abit like him, same general type, a casual resemblance-but even if you werehis twin brother, the marks know they won’t find the Man from Mars in a tenin-one in the sticks. It’s as silly as it would be to bill a sword swallower as .thePresident of the United States.’ Get me? A chump wants to believe-but hewon’t thank you to insult what trace of intelligence he has. And even a chumphas brains of a sort. You have to remember that.“.I will remember.“.Okay. I talk too much-but a talker gets in the habit. Are you kids going to beall right? How’s the grouch bag? Hell, I oughtn’t to do it-but do you need aloan?“.Thanks, Tim. We’re not hurtin’ any.“.Well, take care of yourself. Bye, Jill.“ He hurried out.\n 　　Patricia Paiwonski came in through the rear fly, wearing a robe. .Kids? Timsloughed your act.“.We were leaving anyhow, Pat.“.I knew he was going to. He makes me so mad I’m tempted to jump theshow myself.“.Now, Pat-.\n 　　.I mean it. I could take my act anywhere and he knows it. Leave him withouta blow-off. He can get other acts . . . but a good blow-off that the clownswon’t clobber is hard to find.“.Pat, Tim is right, and Jill and I know it. I don’t have showmanship.“.Well ... maybe so. But I’m going to miss you. You’ve been just like my ownkids to me. Oh, dear! Look, the show doesn’t roll until morning-come back tomy living top and set awhile and visit.“Jill said, .Better yet, Patty, come into town with us and have a couple ofdrinks. How would you like to soak yourself in a big, hot tub, with bath salts?“.Uh, I’ll bring a bottle.“.No,“ Mike objected, .I know what you drink and we’ve got it. Come along.“.Well, I’ll come-you’re at the Imperial, aren’t you?-but I can’t come with you.\n 　　I’ve got to be sure my babies are all right first and tell Honey Bun I’ll be gonea bit and fix her hot water bottles. I’ll catch a cab. Half an hour, maybe.“They drove into town with Mike at the controls. It was a fairly small town,without automatic traffic control even downtown. Mike drove with carefulprecision, exactly at zone maximum and sliding the little ground car into holesJill could not see until they were through them. He did it without effort in thesame fashion in which he juggled. Jill knew how it was done, had evenlearned to do it a bit herself; Mike stretched his time sense until the problemof juggling eggs or speeding through traffic was an easy one with’ everythingin slow motion. Nevertheless she reflected that it was an oddaccomplishment for a man who, only months earlier, had been baffled bytying shoelaces.\n 　　She did not talk. Mike could talk while on extended time, if necessary, but itwas awkward to converse while they were running on different time rates.\n 　　Instead she thought with mild nostalgia of the life they were leaving, calling itup in her mind and cherishing it, some of it in Martian concepts, more of it inEnglish. She had enjoyed it very much. All her life, until she had met Mike,she had been under the tyranny of the clock, first as a little girl in school, thenas a bigger girl in a much harder school, then under the unforgivingpressures of hospital routine.\n 　　The carnival had been nothing like that. Aside from the easy and ratherpleasant chore of standing around and looking pretty several times a dayfrom midafternoon to the last bally of the night, she never had anything sheactually had to do at any set time. Mike did not care whether they ate once aday or six times, and whatever housekeeping she chose to do suited him.\n 　　They had their own living top and camping equipment; in many towns theyhad never left the lot from arrival to tear-down. The carnival was a closedlittle world, an enclave, where the headlines and troubles of the outside worlddid not reach. She had been happy in it.\n 　　To be sure, in every town the lot was crawling with marks-but she hadacquired the carney viewpoint; marks did not count-they might as well havebeen behind glass. Jill quite understood why the girls in the posing showcould and did exhibit themselves in very little (and, in some towns, nothing, ifthe fix was solid) without feeling immodest . . . and without being immodest intheir conduct outside the posing show. Marks weren’t people to them; theywere blobs of nothing, hardly seen, whose sole function was to cough up halfdollars for the take.\n 　　Yes, the carnie had been a happy, utterly safe home, even though theft acthad flopped. It had not always been that way when first they left the safety ofJubal’s home to go out into the world and increase Mike’s education. Theyhad been spotted more than once and several times they had had troublegetting away, not only from the press, but from the endless people whoseemed to feel that they had a right to demand things of Mike, simplybecause he had the misfortune to be the Man from Mars.\n 　　Presently Mike had thought his features into more mature lines and hadmade other slight changes in his appearance. That, plus the fact that theyfrequented places where the Man from Mars would certainly not be expected(by the public) to go, got them privacy. About that time, when Jill was phoninghome to give a new mailing address, Jubal had suggested a cover-up storyanda couple of days later Jill had read that the Man from Mars had againgone into retreat, this time in a Tibetan monastery.\n 　　The retreat had actually been .Hank’s Grill“ in a .nowhere“ town, with Jill as awaitress and Mike as dishwasher. It was no worse than being a nurse andmuch less demanding-and her feet no longer hurt. Mike had a remarkablyquick way of cleaning dishes, although he had to be careful not to use itwhen the boss was watching. They kept that job a week, then moved on,sometimes working, sometimes not. They visited public libraries almost daily,once Mike found out about them-Jill had discovered that Mike had taken forgranted that Jubal’s library contained a copy of every book on Earth. Whenhe learned the marvelous truth, they had remained in Akron nearly a month.\n 　　Jill did quite a lot of shopping that month, as Mike with a book was almost nocompany at all.\n 　　But Baxter’s Combined Shows and Riot of Fun for All the Family had beenthe nicest part of their meandering trip. Jill recalled with an inner giggle thetime in-what town?-no matter-when the entire posing show had beenpinched. It wasn’t fair, even by chumps’ standards, since that concessionalways worked under precise prearrangement: bras or no bras; blue lights orbright lights; whatever the top town clown ordained. Nevertheless the sheriffhad hauled them in and the local justice of the peace had seemed disposednot only to fine but to jail the girls as .vagrants.“The lot had closed down and most of the carnies had gone to the hearing,along with innumerable chumps slavering to catch sight of .shamelesswomen“ getting their come-uppance. Mike and Jill had managed to crowdagainst the back wall of the courtroom.\n 　　Jill had long since impressed on Mike that he must never do anything that anordinary human could not do where it might be noticed. But Mike hadgrokked a cusp and had not discussed it with Jill.\n 　　The sheriff was testifying as to what he had seen, the details of this .publiclewdness“-and he was enjoying it.\n 　　Mike had restrained himself, Jill admitted. In the midst of testimony bothsheriff and judge became suddenly and completely without clothes of anysort.\n 　　She and Mike slipped quietly away during the excitement, and later shelearned that the accused, all of them, had left, too, and nobody seemeddisposed to object. Of course no one had connected the miracle with Mike,and he himself had never mentioned it to Jill-nor she to him; it was notnecessary. The show had torn down at once and moved on two days early,to a more honest town where the rule was net bra and briefies and no beefsafterwards.\n 　　But Jill would treasure forever the expression on the sheriff’s face, and hisappearance, too, when it was plain to be seen that his sudden sag in frontmeant that the sheriff had been wearing a tight corset for his pride.\n 　　Yes, carnie days had been nice days. She started to speak to Mike in hermind, intending to remind him of how funny that hick sheriff had looked withcreases from his girdle on his hairy pot belly. But she stopped. Martian hadno concept for .funny“ so of course she could not say it. They shared agrowing telepathic bond~but in Martian only.\n 　　(.Yes Jill?“) his mind answered hers.\n 　　(.Later.“)Shortly they approached the Imperial Hotel and she felt his mind slow downas he parked the car. Jill much prefeffed camping on the carnival grounds . . .\n 　　except fox one thing: bathtubS. Showers were a1~ right, but nothing couldbeat a big tub of hot, hot water, climb into it up to your chin and soak!\n 　　Sometimes they checked into a hotel for a few days and rented a ground car.\n 　　Mike did not, by early training, share her fanatic enthusiasm for scrubbing; hewas now as fastidiously clean as she was- but only because she had trainedhim to be; it did not annoy him. Moreover, he could keep himself immaculatewithout wasting time on washing or bathing, just as he never had to see abarber once he knew precisely how Jill wanted his hair to grow. But Mike,too, liked the time spent in hotels for the sake of baptism alone; be enjoyedimmersing himself in the water of life as much as ever, irrespective of a nonexistantneed to clean and no longer with any superstitious feeling aboutwater.\n 　　The Imperial was a very old hotel and had not been much even when new,but the tub in what was proudly called the .Bridal Suite“ was satisfactorilylarge. Jill went straight to it as they came in, started to fill it-and was hardlysurprised to find herself suddenly ready for her bath, even to pretty bare feet,except that her purse was still clutched under her arm. Dear Mike! He knewhow she liked to shop. how pleased she was with new clothes; he gentlyforced her to indulge her childish weakness by sending to neverwhere anyoutfit which he sensed no longer delighted her. He would have done so dailyhad she not cautioned him that too many new clothes would make themconspicuous around the carnival.\n 　　.Thanks, dear!“ she called out. .Let’s climb in.“He had either undressed or caused his own clothes to go away- probably theformer she decided; Mike found buying clothes for himself without interest.\n 　　He still could see no possible reason for clothes other than for simpleprotection against the elements, a weakness he did not share. They got intothe tub facing each other; she scooped up a handful of water, touched it toher lips, offered it to him. lt was not necessary to speak, nor was the ritualnecessary; it simply pleased Jill to remind them both of something for whichno reminder could ever be necessary, through all eternity.\n 　　When he raised his head, she said, .The thing I was thinking of while youwere driving was how funny that horrid sheriff looked in his skin“.Did be look funny?“.Oh, very funny indeed! It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud.\n 　　But I did not want us noticed.“.Explain to me why he was funny. I do not see the joke.“.Uh ... dear, I don’t think I can explain it. It was not a joke-not like puns andthings like that which can be explained.“.I did not grok that he was funny,“ Mike said seriously. .In both those men-thejudge and the lawman-I grokked wrongness. Had I not known that it woulddisplease you, I would have sent them both away.“.Dear Mike.“ She touched his cheek. .Good Mike. Believe me, dearest, it wasbetter far to do only what you did do. Neither one of them will ever live itdown-and I’ll bet that there won’t be another attempt to arrest anyone forindecent exposure in that township for another fifty years. Let’s talk aboutsomething else. I have been wanting to say that I am sorry, truly sorry, thatyour act didn’t go over. I did my best in writing the patter for it, dear-but Iguess I’m no showman, either.“.It was my lack, Jill. Tim speaks rightly-I don’t grok the chumps. Neverthelessit has been good to be with Baxter’s Combined Shows . . . I have grokkedcloser to the chumps each day.“.Only we must not call them chumps any longer, nor marks, now that we areno longer with it. Just people-not .chumps.’“.I grok that they are chumps.“.Yes, dear. But it isn’t polite to say so.“.I will remember.“.Have you decided where we are going now?“.No. When the time comes, I will know.“.Yes, dear.“ Jill reflected that Mike always did know. From his first changefrom docility to dominance he had grown steadily in strength andsureness~all ways. The boy (he bad seemed like a boy then) who had foundit tiring to hold an ash tray in the air, could now not only hold her in the air(and it did feel like .floating on clouds“; that was why she had written it intothe patter that way) while doing several other things and continuing to talk,but also could exert any other strength he needed~be recalled one very rainylot where one of the trucks had bogged down. Twenty men were crowdedaround it, trying to get it free-Mike had added his shoulder . . and the truckmoved.\n 　　She had seen how it had happened; the sunken hind wheel had simply lifteditself out of the mud. But Mike, much more sophisticated now, had notallowed anyone to guess.\n 　　She recalled, too, when be had at last grokked that the injunction about.wrongness“ being necessary before he could make things go away appliedonly to living, grokking things-her dress did not have to have .wrongness“ forhim to toss it away. The injunction was merely a precaution in the training ofnestlings; an adult was free to do as he grokked.\n 　　She wondered what his next major change would be? But she did not worryabout it; Mike was good and wise. All she could teach him were little detailsof how to live among humans-while leaning much more from him, in perfecthappiness, greater happiness than she had known since her father died.\n 　　.Mike, wouldn’t it be nice to have Dorcas and Anne and Miriam all here in thetub, too? And Father Jubal and the boys and- oh, our whole family!“.It would take a bigger tub.“.Who minds a little crowding? But Jubal’s pool would do nicely. When are wemaldng another visit home, Mike? Jubal asks me every time I talk to him.“.I grok it will be soon.“.Martian .soon’? Or Earth .soon’? Never mind, darling, I know it will be whenthe waiting is filled. But that reminds me that Aunt Patty will be here soon andI do mean Earth .soon.’ Wash me off?“She stood up, he stayed where he was. The soap lifted out of the soap dish,traveled all over her, replaced itself, and the soapy layer slathered intobubbles of lather. .Ooohl That’s enough. You tickle.“.Rinse?“.I’ll just dunk.“ Quickly she squatted down, sloshed suds off her, stood up.\n 　　.Just in time, too.“Someone was knocking at the outer door. .Deane? Are you decent?“.Coming, Pat!“ Jill shouted and added as she stepped out of the tub, .Dryme, please?“At once she was dry, leaving not even wet footprints on the bath mat. .Dear?\n 　　You’ll remember to put on some clothes before you come out? Patty’s a ladynotlike me.“.I will remember.“\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/345.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
