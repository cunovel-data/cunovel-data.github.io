{"id":32565,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"THE FIRST MIXED LOAD Of permanent colonists arrived on Mars; six of theseventeen survivors of the twenty~thtee originals retumed to Earth.\n 　　Prospective colonists trained in Peru at sixteen thousand feet. The presidentof Argentina moved one night to Montevideo, taking with him such portablesas could be stuffed into two suitcases, and the new Presidente started anextradition procesS before the high Court to yank him back, or at least thetwo suitcases. Last rites for Alice Douglas were held privately in the NationalCathedral with less than two thousand attending, and editorialists and stereocomentators alike praised the dignified fortitude with which the SecretaryGeneral took his bereavement. A three-year-old named Inflation, carrying126 pounds with Jinx Jenkins Up, won the Kentucky Derby, paying fifty-fourfor one, and two guests of the Colony Airotel, Louisville, Kentucky,discorporated, one voluntarily, the other by heart failure.\n 　　Another bootleg edition of the (unauthorized) biography The Devil andReverend Foster appeared simultaneously on news stands throughout theUnited States; by nightfall every copy had been burned and the platesdestroyed, along with incidental damage to other chattels and to real estate,plus a certain amount of mayhem, maiming, and simple assault. The BritishMuseum was rumored to possess a copy of the first edition (untrue), and alsothe Vatican Library (true, but available only to certain church scholars).\n 　　In the Tennessee legislature a bill was again introduced to make the ratio piexactly equal to three; it was reported out by the committee on publiceducation and morals, passed with no objection by the lower house and diedin conimittee in the upper house. An interchurch fundamentalist groupopened offices in Van Buren, Arkansas, for the purpose of soliciting funds tosend missionaries to the Martians; Dr. Jubal Harshaw happily sent them alavish donation, but took the precaution of sending it in the name (and withthe address) of the editor of the New Humanist, a rabid atheist and his closefriend.\n 　　Other than that, Jubal had very little to feel amused about_there had beentoo much news about Mike lately, and all of it depressing. He had treasuredthe occasional visits home of Jill and Mike and had been most interested inMike’s progress, especially after Mike developed a sense of humor. But theycame home less frequently now and Jubal did not relish the latestdevelopments.\n 　　It bad not troubled Jubal when Mike was run out of Union TheologicalSeminary, hotly pursued in spirit by a pack of enraged theologians, some ofwhom were angry because they believed in God and others because they didnot-but all united in detesting the Man from Mars. Jubal honestly evaluedanything that happened to a theologian short of breaking him on the wheelwas no more than meet-and the experience was good for the boy; he’d knowbetter next time.\n 　　Nor had he been troubled when Mike (with the help of Douglas) had enlistedunder an assumed name in the Federation armed forces. He had been quitesure (through private knowledge) that no sergeant could cause Mike anypermanent distress, and contrariwise, Jubal was not troubled by what mighthappen to sergeants or other ranks-an unreconciled old reactionary, Jubalhad burned his own honorable discharge and all that went with it on the daythat the United States had ceased having its own armed forces.\n 　　Actually, Jubal had been surprised at how little shambles Mike had createdas .Private Jones“ and how long be had lasted-almost three weeks. He hadcrowned his military career the day that be had seized on the question periodfollowing an orientation lecture to hold forth on the utter uselessness of forceand violence under any circumstances (with some side continents on thedesirability of reducing surplus population through cannibalism) and hadoffered himself as a test animal for any weapon of any nature to prove tothem that force was not only unnecessary but literally impossible whenattempted against a self-disciplined person.\n 　　They had not taken his offer; they had kicked him out.\n 　　But there had been a little more to it than that, Douglas had allowed Jubal tosee a top-level super secret eyes-only numbered-one-of-three report aftercautioning Jubal that no one, not even the Supreme Chief of staff, knew that.Private Jones“ was the Man from Mars. Jubal had merely scanned theexhibits, which bad been mostly highly conflicting reports of eye witnesses asto what had happened at various times when .Jones“ had been .trained“ inthe uses of various weapons; the only surprising thing to Jubal about themwas that some witnesses bad the courage and self-confidence to state underoath that they bad seen weapons disappear. .Jones“ had also been placedon the report three times for losing weapons, same being accountableproperty of the Federation.\n 　　The end of the report was all that Jubal had bothered to read carefullyenough to remember: .Conclusion: Subject man is an extremely talentednatural hypnotist and, as such, could conceivably be useful in intelligencework, although he is totally unfitted for any combat branch. However, his lowintelligence quotient (moron), his extremely low general classification score,and his paranoid tendencies (delusions of grandeur) make it inadvisable toattempt to exploit his idiot-savant talent. Recommendation: Discharge,Inaptitude-no pension credit, no benefits.“Such little romps were good for the boy and Jubal had greatly enjoyed Mike’singlorious career as a soldier because Jill had spent the time at home. WhenMike had come home for a few days after it was over, he hadn’t seemed hurtby it-he had boasted to Jubal that he had obeyed Jill’s wishes exactly andhadn’t disappeared anybody merely a few dead things . . . although, as Mikegrokked it, there had been several times when Earth could have been madea better place if Jill didn’t have this queasy weakness. Jubal didn’t argue it;he had a lengthy-though inactive, .Better Dead“ list himself.\n 　　But apparently Mike had managed to have fun, too. During parade on his lastday as a soldier, the commanding General and his entire staff had suddenlylost their trousers as Mike’s platoon was passing in review-and the topsergeant of Mike’s company fell fiat on his face when his shoes momentarilyfroze to the ground. Jubal decided that, in acquiring a sense of humor, Mikebad developed an atrocious taste in practical jokes-but what the hell? the kidwas going through a delayed boyhood; he needed to dump over a fewprivies. Jubal recalled with pleasure an incident in medical school involving acadaver and the Dean-Jubal had worn rubber gloves for that caper, and agood thing, too!\n 　　Mike’s unique ways of growing up were all right; Mike was unique.\n 　　But this last thing-.The Reverend Dr. Valentine M. Smith, AS., D.D., Ph.D.,“founder and pastor of the Church of All Worlds, inc.-gad! It was bad enoughthat the boy had decided to be a Holy Joe, instead of leaving other people’ssouls alone, as a gentleman should. But those diploma-mill degrees he hadtacked onto his name-Jubal wanted to throw up.\n 　　The worst of it was that Mike had told him that he had gotten the whole ideafrom something he had heard Jubal say, about what a church was and whatit could do. Jubal was forced to admit that it was something he could havesaid, although he did not recall it; it was little consolation that the boy knewso much law that he might have arrived at the same end on his own.\n 　　But Jubal did concede that Mike had been cagy about the operation- someactual months of residence at a very small, very poor (in all senses) sectariancollege, a bachelor’s degree awarded by examination, a .call“ to their ministryfollowed by ordination in this recognized though flat-headed sect, a doctor’sdissertation on comparative religion which was a marvel of scholarship whileducking any real conclusions (Mike had brought it to Jubal for literarycriticism, Jubal had added some weasel words himself through conditionedreflex), the award of the .earned“ doctorate coinciding with an endowment(anonymous) to this very hungry school, the second doctorate (honorary)right on top of it for .contributions to interplanetary knowledge“ from adistinguished university that should have known better, when Mike let it beknown that such was his price for showing up as the drawing card at aconference on solar system studies. The one and only Man from Mars hadturned down everybody from CalTech to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in thepast; Harvard University could hardly be blamed for swallowing the bait.\n 　　Well, they were probably as crimson as their banner now, Jubal thoughtcynically. Mike had then put in a few weeks as assistant chaplain at hischurch-mouse alma mater-then had broken with the sect in a schism andfounded his own church. Completely kosher, legally airtight, as venerable inprecedent as Martin Luther . . . and as nauseating as last week’s garbage.\n 　　Jubal was called out of his sour daydream by Miriam. .Boss! Company!“Jubal looked up to see a car about to land and ruminated that he had notrealized what a blessing that S.S. patrol cap had been until it was withdrawn.\n 　　.Larry, fetch my shotgun-I promised myself that I would shoot the next doltwho landed on the rose bushes.“.He’s landing on the grass, Boss.“.Well, tell him to try again. We’ll get him on the next pass.“.Looks like Ben Caxton.“.So it is. We’ll let him live-this time. Hi, Ben! What’ll you drink?“.Nothing, this early in the day, you professional bad influence. Need totalk to you, Jubal.“.You’re doing it. Dorcas, fetch Ben a glass of warm milk; he’s sick.“.Without too much soda,“ amended Ben, .and milk the bottle with the threedimples in it. Private talk, Jubal.“.All right, up to my study-although if you think you can keep anything from thekids around here, let me in on your method.“ After Ben finished greetingproperly (and somewhat unsanitarily, in three cases) the members of thefamily, they moseyed upstairs.\n 　　Ben said, .What the deuce? Am I lost?“.Oh. You haven’t seen the alterations, have you? A new wing on the north,which gives us two more bedrooms and another bath downstairs- and uphere, my gallery.“.Enough statues to fill a graveyard!“.Please, Ben. .Statues’ are dead politicians at boulevard intersections. Whatyou see is .sculpture.’ And please speak in a low, reverent tone lest I becomeviolent . . . for here we have exact replicas of some of the greatest sculpturethis naughty globe has produced.“.Well, that hideous thing I’ve seen before ... but when did you acquire the restof this ballast?“Jubal ignored him and spoke quietly to the replica of La Belle Heaulmière.\n 　　.Do not listen to him, ma petite chere-he is a barbarian and knows no better.“He put his hand to her beautiful raaged cheek, then gently touched oneempty, shrunken dug. .I know just how you feel but it can’t be very muchlonger. Patience, my lovely.“He turned back to Caxton and said briskly, .Ben, I don’t know what you haveon your mind but it will have to wait while I give you a lesson in how to look atsculpture-though it’s probably as useless as trying to teach a dog toappreciate the violin. But you’ve just been rude to a lady and I don’t toleratethat.“.Huh? Don’t be silly, Jubal; you’re rude to ladies-live ones-a dozen times aday. And you know which ones I mean.“Jubal shouted, .Anne! Upstairs! Wear your cloak!“.You know I wouldn’t be rude to the old woman who posed for that. Never.\n 　　What I can’t understand is a so-called artist having the gall to posesomebody’s great grandmother in her skin . . . and you having the bad tasteto want it around.“Anne came in, cloaked, said nothing. Jubal said to her, .Anne have I everbeen rude to you? Or to any of the girls?“.That calls for an opinion.“.That’s what I’m asking for. Your opinion. You’re not in court-.\n 　　.You have never at any time been rude to any of us, Jubal.“.Have you ever known me to be rude to a lady?“.I have seen you be intentionally rude to a woman. I have never seen yoube rude to a lady.“.That’s all. No, one more opinion. What do you think of this bronze?“Anne looked carefully at Rodin’s masterpiece, then said slowly, .When I firstsaw it, I thought it was horrible. But I have come to the conclusion that it maybe the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.“.Thanks. That’s all.“ She left. .Do you want to argue it, Ben?“.Huh? When I argue with Anne, that’s the day I turn in my suit.“ Ben looked atit. .But I don’t get it.“.All right, Ben. Attend me. Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a prettygirl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become.\n 　　A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she usedto be. But a great artist-a master-and that is what Auguste Rodin was-canlook at an old woman, portray her exactly as she is . . . and force the viewerto see the pretty girl she used to be . . . and more than that, he can makeanyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even you, see that this lovelyyoung girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but simply prisoned inside herruined body. He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there wasnever a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart . . . nomatter what the merciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. Growingold doesn’t matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired-but itdoes to them. Look at her!“Ben looked at her. Presently Jubal said gruffly, .All right, blow your nose andwipe your eyes-she accepts your apology. Come on and sit down. That’senough for one lesson.“.No,“ Caxton answered, .I want to know about these others. How about thisone? It doesn’t bother me as much . . . I can see it’s a young girl, right off.\n 　　But why tie her up like a pretzel?“Jubal looked at the replica .Caryatid Who has Fallen under the Weight of herStone“ and smiled. .Call it a tour de force in empathy, Ben. I won’t expect youto appreciate the shapes and masses which make that figure much morethan a .pretzel’-but you can appreciate what Rodin was saying. Ben, what dopeople get out of looking at a crucifix?“.You know how much I go to church.“.’How little’ you mean. Still, you must know that, as craftsmanship, paintingsand sculpture of the Crucifixion are usually atrocious-and the painted,realistic ones often used in churches are the worst of all . . . the blood lookslike catsup and that ex-carpenter is usually portrayed as if he were a pansy . .\n 　　. which He certainly was not if there is any truth in the four Gospels at all. Hewas a hearty man, probably muscular and of rugged health. But despite thealmost uniformly poor portrayal in representations of the Crucifixion, a poorone is about as effective as a good one for most people. They don’t see thedefects; what they see is a symbol which inspires their deepest emotions; itrecalls to them the Agony and Sacrifice of God.“.Jubal, I thought you weren’t a Christian?“.What’s that got to do with it? Does that make me blind and deaf tofundamental human emotion? I was saying that the crummiest paintedplaster crucifix or the cheapest cardboard Christmas Crèche can be sufficientsymbol to evoke emotions in the human heart so strong that many have diedfor them and many more live for them. So the craftsmanship and artisticjudgment with which such a symbol is wrought are largely irrelevant. Nowhere we have another emotional symbol-wrought with exquisitecraftsmanship, but we won’t go into that, yet. Ben, for almost three thousandyears or longer, architects have designed buildings with columns shaped asfemale figures-it got to be such a habit that they did it as casually as a smallboy steps on an ant. After all those centuries it took Rodin to see that thiswas work too heavy for a girl. But he didn’t simply say, .Look, you jerks, if youmust design this way, make it a brawny male figure.’ No, he showed it . . .\n 　　and generalized the symbol. Here is this poor little caryatid who has tried-andfailed, fallen under the load. She’s a good girl-look at her face. Serious,unhappy at her fafrure, but not blaming anyone else, not even the gods . . .\n 　　and still trying to shoulder her load, after she’s crumpled under it.\n 　　.But she’s more than good art denouncing some very bad art; she’s a symbolfor every woman who has ever tried to shoulder a load that was too heavy forher-over half the female population of this planet, living and dead, I wouldguess. But not alone women-this symbol is sexless. It means every man andevery woman who ever lived who sweated out life in uncomplaining fortitude,whose courage wasn’t even noticed until they crumpled under their loads. It’scourage, Ben, and victory.“.’Victory?’“.Victory in defeat, there is none higher. She didn’t give up, Ben; she’s stilltrying to lift that stone after it has crushed her. She’s a father going down to adull office job while cancer is painfully eating away his insides, so as to bringhome one more pay check for the kids. She’s a twelve-yearold girl trying tomother her baby brothers and sisters because Mama had to go to Heaven.\n 　　She’s a switchboard operator sticking to her job while smoke is choking herand the fire is cutting off her escape. She’s all the unsung heroes whocouldn’t quite cut it but never quit. Come. Just salute as you pass her andcome see my Little Mermaid.“Ben took him precisely at his word; if Jubal was surprised, he made nocomment. .Now this one,“ he said, .is the only one Mike didn’t give to me. Butthere is no need to tell Mike why I got it . . . aside from the selfevident factthat it’s one of the most delightful compositions ever conceived and proudlyexecuted by the eye and hand of man.“.She’s that, all right. This one I don’t have to have explained-it’s just plainpretty!“.Yes. And that is excuse in itself, just as with kittens and butterflies. But thereis more to it than that . . . and she reminded me of Mike. She’s not quite amermaid-see?-and she’s not quite human. She sits on land, where she haschosen to stay . . . and she stares eternally out to sea, homesick and foreverlonely for what she left behind. You know the story?“.Hans Christian Andersen.“.Yes. She sits by the harbor of K.benhavn-Copenhagen was his home townandshe’s everybody who ever made a difficult choice. She doesn’t regret herchoice, but she must pay for it; every choice must be paid for. The cost to heris not only endless homesickness. She can never be quite human; when sheuses her dearly bought feet, every step is on sharp knives. Ben, I think thatMike must always walk on knives-but there is no need to tell him I said so. Idon’t think he knows this story or, at least, I don’t think he knows that Iconnect him with it.“.I won’t tell him.“ Ben looked at the replica. .I’d rather just look at her and notthink about the knives.“.She’s a little darling, isn’t she? How would you like to coax her into bed?\n 　　She would probably be lively, like a seal, and about as slippery.“.Cripes! You’re an evil old man, Jubal.“.And getting eviler and eviler by the year. Uh ... we won’t look at any others;three pieces of sculpture in an hour is more than enough- usually I don’t letmyself look at more than one in a day.“.Suits. I feel as if I had had three quick drinks on an empty stomach. Jubal,why isn’t there stuff like this around where a person can see it?“.Because the world has gone nutty and contemporary art always paints thespirit of its times. Rodin did his major work in the tail end of the nineteenthcentury and Hans Christian Andersen antedated him by only a few years.\n 　　Rodin died early in the twentieth century, about the time the world startedflipping its lid . . . and art along with it.\n 　　.Rodin’s successors noted the amazing things he had done with light andshadow and mass and composition-whether you see it or not-and theycopied that much. Oh, how they copied it! And extended it. What they failedto see was that every major work of the master told a story and laid bare thehuman heart. Instead, they got involved with .design’ and becamecontemptuous of any painting or sculpture that told a story- sneering, theydubbed such work .literary’-a dirty word. They went all out for abstractions,not deigning to paint or carve anything that resembled the human world.“Jubal shrugged. .Abstract design is all right-for wall paper or linoleum. But anis the process of evoking pity and terror, which is not abstract at all but veryhuman. What the self-styled modern artists are doing is a sort of unemotionalpseudo-intellectual masturbation . . . whereas creative art is more likeintercourse, in which the artist must seduce- render emotional-his audience,each time. These laddies who won’t deign to do that-and perhaps can’t-ofcourse lost the public. If they hadn’t lobbied for endless subsidies, they wouldhave starved or been forced to go to work long ago. Because the ordinarybloke will not voluntarily pay for .art’ that leaves him unmoved-if he does payfor it, the money has to be conned out of him, by taxes or such.“.You know, Jubal, I’ve always wondered why I didn’t give a hoot for paintingsor statues-but I thought it was something missing in me, like color blindness.“.Mmm, one does have to learn to look at art, just as you must know French toread a story printed in French. But in general it’s up to the artist to uselanguage that can be understood, not hide it in some privite code like Pepysand his diary. Most of these jokers don’t even want to use language you and Iknow or can learn . . . they would rather sneer at us and be smug, becausewe .fail’ to see what they are driving at. If indeed they are driving at anythingobscurityis usually the refuge of incompetence. Ben, would you call me anartist?“.Huh? Well, I’ve never thought about it. You write a pretty good stick.“.Thank you. .Artist’ is a word I avoid for the same reasons I hate to be called.Doctor.’ But I am an artist, albeit a minor one. Admittedly most of my stuff isfit to read only once . . . and not even once for a busy person who alreadyknows the little I have to say. But I am an honest artist, because what I writeis consciously intended to reach the customer-reach him and affect him, ifpossible with pity and terror . . . or, if not, at least to divert the tedium of hishours with a chuckle or an odd idea. But I am never trying to hide it from himin a private language, nor am I seeking the praise of other writers for.technique’ or other balderdash. I want the praise of the cash customer, givenin cash because I’ve reached him-or I don’t want anything. Support for thearts-merdel A government-supported artist is an incompetent whore! Damn it,you punched one of my buttons. Let me fill your glass, and you tell me whatis on your mind.“.Uh, Jubal, I’m unhappy.“.This is news?“.No. But I’ve got a fresh set of troubles.“ Ben frowned. .I shouldn’t have comehere, I guess. No need to burden you with them. I’m not even sure I want totalk about them.“.Okay. But as long as you’re here, you can listen to my troubles.“.You have troubles? Jubal, I’ve always thought of you as the one man whohad managed to beat the game, six ways from zero.“.Hmm, sometime I must tell you about my married life. But-yes, I’ve gottroubles now. Some of them are evident. Duke has left me, you know-or didyou?“.Yeah. I knew.“.Larry is a good gardener-but half the gadgets that keep this log cabinrunning are failing to pieces. I don’t know how I can replace Duke. Good allaroundmechanics are scarce . . . and ones that will fit into this household, bea member of the family in all ways, are almost non-existent. I’m limping alongon repalnnen called in from town-every visit a disturbance, all of them withlarceny in their hearts, and most of them incompetent to use a screw driverwithout cutting themselves. Which I am incapable of doing, too, so I have tohire help. Or move back into town, God forbid.“.My heart aches for you, Jubal.“.Never mind the sarcasm, that’s just the start. Mechanics and gardenem areconvenient, but for me secretaries are essential. Two of mine are pregnant,one is getting married.“Caxton looked utterly astounded. Jubal growled, .Oh, I’m not telling tales outof school; they’re smug as can be-nothing secret about any of it. They’reundoubtedly sore at me right now because I took you up here without givingthem time to boast. So be a gent and be surprised when they tell you.“.Uh, which one is getting married?“.Isn’t that obvious? The happy man is that smooth-talking refugee from asand storm, our esteemed water brother Stinky Mahmoud. I’ve told him flatlythat they have to live here whenever they’re in this country. Dastard justlaughed and said how else?-pointed out that I had invited him to live here,permanently, long ago.“ Jubal sniffed. .Wouldn’t be so bad if he would just doit. I might even get some work out of her. Maybe.“.You probably would. She likes to work. And the other two are pregnant?“.Higher .n a kite. I’m refreshing myself in O.B. because they both say they’regoing to have .em at home. And what a crimp that’s going to put into myworking habits! Worse than kittens. But why do you assume that neither ofthe two turgescent tummies belongs to the bride?“.Oh- Why, I suppose I assumed that Stinky was more conventional than that .\n 　　. . or maybe more cautious.“.Stinky wouldn’t be given a ballot. Ben, in the eighty or ninety years I havegiven to this subject, trying to trace out the meanderings of their twisty littleminds, the only thing that I have learned for certain about women is thatwhen a gal is gonna, she’s gonna. All a man can do is cooperate with theinevitable.“Ben thought ruefully about times when he had resorted to fast footwork-andother times when he hadn’t been fast enough. .Yeah, you’re right. Well,which one isn’t getting married or anything? Miriam? Or Anne?“.Hold it, I didn’t say the bride was pregnant ... and anyhow, you seem to beassuming that Dorcas is the prospective bride. You haven’t kept your eyesopen. It’s Miriam who is studying Arabic like mad, so she can do it right.“.Huh? Well, I’ll be a cross-eyed baboon!“.You obviously are.“.But Miriam was always snapping at Stinky-.\n 　　.And to think that they trust you with a newspaper column. Ever watch abunch of sixth-graders?“.Yes, but- Dorcas did everything but a nautch dance.“.That is just Dorcas’s natural, normal behavior with all men. She used ittoward you, too-although I suppose you were too preoccupied elsewhere torealize it. Never mind. Just be sure that when Miriam shows you her ring-thesize of a roe’s egg and about as scarce-be sure to be surprised. And I’mdamned if I’ll sort out which two are spawning, so that you’ll be certain to besurprised. Just remember that they are pleased about it . . . which is why Itipped you off ahead of time, so that you wouldn’t make the mistake ofthinking that they thought they were .caught.’ They don’t. They weren’t.\n 　　They’re smug.“ Jubal sighed. .But I’m not. I’m getting too old to enjoy thepatter of little feet when I’m busy ... and contrariwise, I won it lose perfectsecretaries-and kids that I love, as you know-for any reason if I can possiblyinduce them to stay. But I must say that this household has become steadilymore disorganized ever since the night Jill kicked Mike’s feet out from underhim. Not that I blame her and I don’t think you do, either.“.No, I don’t, but-Jubal, let me get this straight. Are you under the impressionthat Jill started Mike on his merry rounds?“.Huh?“ Jubal looked startled, then thought back-and admitted to himself thathe had never known . . . he had simply assumed it from the fact that when itcame to a decision, Jill had been the one who had gone away with Mike.\n 　　.Who was it?“.’Don’t be nosy, bub,’ as you would put it. If she wants to tell you, she will.\n 　　However, Jill told me-straightened me out when I made the same jumping-toconclusionsthat you did. Mmm-. Ben thought. .As I understand it, which oneof the four happened to score the first run was more or less chance.“.Mmm ... yes. I believe you’re right.“.Jill thinks so. Except that she thinks Mike was exceedingly lucky inhappening to seduce, or be seduced by (if! have the proper verb)-by the onebest fitted to start him off right. Which may give you some hint if you knowanything about how Jill’s mind works.“.Hell, I don’t even know how mine works ... and as for Jill, I would never haveexpected her to take up preaching no matter how lovestruck she was-so Icertainly don’t know how her mind works.“.She doesn’t do much preaching-we’ll get to that. Jubal, what do you readfrom the calendar?“.Huh?“.You know what I mean. You think Mike did it-in both cases. Or you think so ifhis visits home match up in either or both cases.“Jubal said guardedly, .Why do you say that, Ben? I’ve said nothing to leadyou to think so.“.The hell you haven’t. You said that they were smug, both of them. I know alltoo well the effect that goddam superman has on women.“.Hold it, son-he’s your water brother.“Ben said levelly, .I know it-and I love him, too. If! ever decided to go gay,Mike would be my only choice. But that’s all the more reason why Iunderstand why they are smug.“Jubal stared at his glass. .Maybe they just hope. Ben, seems to me yourname could be on the list, even easier than Mike’s. Yes?“.Jubal, you’re out of your mind!“.Take it easy. Nobody is trying to make you get married, I promise you-why, Ihaven’t even painted my shotgun white. While I am not snoopy and I neverhold a bed check around here and I really do, so help me by all the BillionNames of God, believe in not poking my nose into other people’s business,nevertheless while I may be out of my mind-a .least hypothesis’ more thanonce, the last couple of years-I do have normal eyesight and hearing . . . andif a brass band parades through my home, fortissimo, I’ll notice it eventually.\n 　　Question: You’ve slept under this roof dozens of times. Did you, on at leastone of those nights, sleep alone?“.Why, you scoundrel! Uh, I slept alone the very first night I was ever here.“.Dorcas must have been off her feed. No, I remember, you were undersedative that night. You were my patient-doesn’t count. Some other night?\n 　　Just one?“.Your question is irrelevant, immaterial, and beneath my notice.“.That’s an adequate answer, I think. But please note that the addedbedrooms are as far from my bedroom as possible. Soundproofing is neverperfect.“.Jubal, it seems to me that your name is much higher up that list than minecan possibly be.“.What?“.Not to mention Larry and Duke. But, Jubal, almost everybody who knowsyou assumes that you are keeping the fanciest harem since the Sultan wentout of business. Oh, don’t misunderstand me-they envy you. But they thinkyou’re a lecherous old goat, too.“Jubal drummed on the arm of his chair before replying. .Ben, I ordinarily donot mind being treated flippantly by my juniors. I encourage it, as you know.\n 　　But in some matters I insist that my years be treated with respect. This is oneof them.“.Sorry,“ Ben said stiffly. .I thought if it was all right for you to kick my sex lifearound, you would not mind my being equally frank.“.No, no, no, Ben!-you misunderstand me. Your inquiry was in order and yourside comments no more than I had invited. I mean that I require the girls totreat me with respect-on this one subject.“.Oh-.\n 　　.I am, as you pointed out, old-quite old. Privately, to you alone, I am happy tosay that I am still lecherous. But my lechery does not command me and I amnot a goat. I prefer dignity and self-respect to indulging in pastimes which,believe me, I have already enjoyed in full measure and do not need to repeat.\n 　　Ben, a man my age, who looks like a slum clearance in its most depressingstages, can attract a young girl enough to bed her- and possibly big her andthanks for the compliment; it just possibly might not be amiss-through threemeans only: money . . . or second, the equivalent of money in terms of willsand community property and the like and-pause for question: Can youimagine any of these three girls- these four, let me include Jill-bedding with aman, even a young and handsome one, for those reasons?“.No. Categorical no-not any of them.“.Thank you, sir. I associate only with ladies; I see that you know it. The thirdincentive is a most female one. A sweet young girl can, and sometimes does,take an old wreck to bed because she is fond of him and sorry for him andwishes to make him happy. Would that reason apply here?“.Uh ... yes, Jubal, I think it might. With all four of them.“.I think it might, too. Although I’d hate like hell to have any of them sorry forme. But this third reason which any of these four ladies might find sufficientmotivation is not sufficient motivation for me. I wouldn’t put up with it. I havemy dignity, sir-and I hope that I retain my reason long enough to extinguishmyself if it ever appears about to slip. So please take my name off the list.“Caxton grinned. .Okay-you stiff-necked old coot. I just hope that when I amyour age I won’t be so all-fired hard to tempt.“Jubal smiled. .Believe me, it’s better to be tempted and resist, than not toresist and be disappointed. Now about Duke and Larry: I don’t know nor care.\n 　　Whenever anyone has come here, to work and live as a member of thefamily, I have made it bluntly plain that this was neither a sweat shop nor awhore house, but a home . . . and, as such, it combined anarchy and tyrannywithout a trace of democracy, as in any well-run family, i.e., that they wereutterly on their own except where I saw fit to give orders, which orders werenot subject to vote or debate. My tyranny has never extended to their lovelife, if any. All the kids who live here have always chosen to keep their privatematters reasonably private. At least-. Jubal smiled ruefully. .-until the Martianinfluence caused things to get a little out of hand . . . which includes you, too,my water brother. But Duke and Larry have been more restrained, in onesense or the other. Perhaps they have been dragging the gals behind everybush. If so, I haven’t seen it-and there have been no screams.“Ben thought of adding a little to Jubal’s store of facts, decided against it.\n 　　.Then you think it’s Mike.“Jubal scowled. .Yep, I think it’s Mike. That part’s all right-I told you the girlswere smugly happy . . . and I’m not broke plus the fact that I could bleed Mikefor any amount without telling the girls. Their babies won’t lack. But, Ben, I’mtroubled about Mike himself. Very.“.So am I, Jubal.“.And about Jill, too. I should have named Jill.“.Uh ... Jubal, Jill isn’t the problem-other than for me, personally. And that’smy hard luck, I hold no grudge. It’s Mike.“.Damn it, why can’t the boy come home and quit this obscene pulpitpounding?“.Mmm ... Jubal, that’s not quite what he’s doing.“ Ben added, .I’ve justcome from there.“.Huh? Why didn’t you say so?“Ben sighed. .First you wanted to talk art, then you wanted to sing the blues,then you wanted to gossip. What chance have I had?“.Uh ... conceded. You have the floor.“.I was coming back from covering the Cape Town conference; I squeezedout a day and visited them. What I saw worried the hell out of me-so much sothat I stopped just long enough in Washington to get a few columns ahead,then came straight here. Jubal, couldn’t you rig it with Douglas to shut off thefaucet and close down this operation?“Jubal shook his head. .In the first place, I wouldn’t. What Mike does with hislife is his business.“.You would if you had seen what I saw.“.Not I! But in the second place I can’t. Nor can Douglas.“.Jubal, you know quite well that Mike would accept any decision you madeabout his money. He probably wouldn’t even understand it-and he certainlywouldn’t question it.“.Ah, but he would understand it! Ben, recently Mike made his will, drew it uphimself-no attorney-and sent it to me to criticize. Ben, it was one of theshrewdest legal documents I’ve ever seen. He recognized that he had morewealth than his heirs could possibly need-so he used half his money to guardthe other half . . . rigged it so that anyone who contests the will does so to hisown great disadvantage. It is a very cynical document in that respect and isbooby-trapped not only against possible heirsclaimants of his legal parentsand his natural parents-he knows he’s a bastard, though I don’t know how hefound out-but also the same with respect to every member of the Envoy’scompany . . . he provided a generous way to settle Out of court with anypossible unknown heir having a good prima-facie claim-and rigged it so thatthey would almost have to overthrow the government to go into court andbreak his will . . . and the will also showed that he knew exactly each stock,bond, security, and asset he owned. I couldn’t find anything to criticize in it.“(-including, Jubal thought, his provision for you, my brother!) .Then he wentto the trouble of depositing holographic originals in several places . . . andFair-Witness copies in half a dozen reliable brains. Don’t tell me that I couldrig his money without his understanding what I had done!“Ben looked morose. .I wish you could.“.I don’t. But that was just the starter. It wouldn’t help if we could. Mike hasn’ttaken a dollar out of his drawing account for almOst a year. I know, becauseDouglas called me to ask if I thought the major portion of the backlog shouldbe reinvested? Mike hadn’t bothere~l to answer his letters. I told him that washis headache . . . but that if I were steward, I would follow my principal’s lastinstructions.“.No withdrawals? Jubal, he’s spending a lot.“.Maybe the church racket pays well.“.That’s the odd part about it. The Church of All Worlds is not really church.“.Then what is it?“.Uh, primarily it’s a language school.“.Repeat?“.To teach the Martian language.“.Well, no harm in that. But I wish, then, that he w.uldn’t call it a church.“.Well, I guess it is a church, within the legal definition.“.Look, Ben, a roller skating rink is a church-as long as some sect claims thatroller skating is essential to their faith and a part of their worship. Youwouldn’t even have to go that far-Simply claim that roller skating served adesirable though not essential function parallel to that which religious musicserves in most churches. If you can sing to the glory of God, you can skate tothe same end. Believe me, this has all been threshed out. There are templesin Malaya which are nothing to an outsider but boarding houses for snakes . .\n 　　but the same High Court rules them to be .churches’ as protects our ownsects.“.Well, Mike raises snakes, too, as well as teaching Martian. But, Jubal, isn’tanything ruled out?“.Mmm ... that’s a moot point. There are minor restrictiOnS, adjudicated. Achurch usually can’t charge a fee for fortune telling or calling up spirits of thedead_but it can accept offerings . . . and then let custom make the .offerings’\n 　　become fees in fact. Human sacrifice is illegal everywhere-but I’m by nomeans sure that it is not still done in several spots around the globe-andprobably right here in this former land of the free and home of the brave. Theway to do anything under the guise of religion that would otherwise besuppressed is to do it in the inner sanctum and keep the gentiles out. Why,Ben? Is Mike doing something that might get him jailed or hanged?“.Uh, I don’t know. Probably not.“.Well, if he’s careful- The Fosterites have demonstrated how to get by withalmost anything. Certainly much more than Joseph Smith was lynched for.“.Matter of fact, Mike has lifted quite a lot from the Fosterites. That’s part ofwhat worries me.“.But what does worry you? Specifically.“.Uh, Jubal, this has got to be a .water brother’ matter.“.Okay, I had assumed that. I’m prepared to face redhot pincers and the rack,if necessary. Shall I start carrying poison in a hollow tooth? Against thepossibility of cracking?“.Uh, the members of the inner circle are supposed to be able to discorporatevoluntarily any second-no poison needed.“.I’m sorry, Ben. I never got that far. Never mind, I know other adequate waysto put up the only final defense against the third degree. Let’s have it.“.You can discorporate at will, they tell me-if you learn Martian first. Nevermind. Jubal, I said Mike raises snakes. I meant that both figuratively andliterally-the whole setup is a snake pit. UnhealthY.\n 　　.But let me describe it. Mike’s Temple is a big place, almost a labyrinth. A bigauditorium for public meetings, some smaller ones for invitational meetingsmanysmaller rooms-and living quarters-quite a lot of living quarters. Jill sentme a radiogram telling me where to go, so I was dxopped at the livingquarters entrance on the street the Temple backs onto. The living quartersare above the main auditOrium, about as private as you can be and still livein a city.“Jubal nodded. .Makes sense. Be your acts legal or illegal, nosy neighborsare noxious.“.In this case a very good idea. A pair of outer doors let me in; I suppose I wasscanned first, although I didn’t spot the scanner. Through two more sets ofautomatic doors any one of which would slow down a raiding squad-then upa bounce tube. Jubal, it wasn’t an ordinary bounce tube. It wasn’t controlledby the passenger, but by someone out of sight. More evidence that theywanted privacy and meant to have it-a raiding squad would need specialclimbing gear to get up that way. No stairs anywhere. Didn’t feel like theordinary bounce tube, either-frankly, I avoid them when I can; they make mequeasy.“.I have never used them and never shall,“ Jubal said firmly.\n 　　.You wouldn’t have minded this. I floated up gently as a feather.“.Not me, Ben. I don’t trust machinery. It bites.“ Jub8l added, .However, I mustconcede that Mike’s mother was one of the great engineers of all times andhis father-his real father-was a number one pilot and a competent engineer,or better . . . and both of genius level. If Mike has improved bounce tubesuntil they are fit for humans, I ought not to be surprised.“.As may be. I got to the top and was landed without having to grab for it, ordepend on safety nets-I didn’t see any, to tell the truth. Through more doorsthat unlocked for me and into an enormous living room. Enormous! Veryoddly furnished and rather austere. Jubal, there are people who think you runan odd household here.“.I can’t imagine why. Just plain and comfortable.“.Well, your ménage is Aunt Jane’s Finishing School for Refined YoungLadies compared with the weirdie Mike runs. I’m just barely inside the jointwhen the first thing I see I don’t believe. A babe, tattooed from her chin to hertoes-and not a goddam stitch otherwise. Hell, not even the home-grown figleaf-she was tattooed everywhere. Fantastic!“Jubal said quietly, .You’re a big-city bumpkin, Ben. I knew a tattooed ladyonce. Very nice girl. Intense in some ways. But sweet.“.Well,“ Ben conceded. .I was giving you a first impression. This gal is verynice, too, once you get adjusted to her pictorial supplement- and the fact thatshe usually has a snake with her. She’s the one who raises them, rather thanMike.“Jubal shook his head. .I was wondering if by any chance it was the samewoman. Fully tattooed women are rather scarce these days. But the lady Iknew, some thirty years back-too old now to be this one, I suppose -had theusual vulgar fear of snakes, to excess. However, I’m fond of snakes myself . .\n 　　. I look forward to meeting your friend. I hope.“.You will when you visit Mike. She’s sort of a majordomo for him- and apriestess, if you’ll pardon the word. Patricia-but called .Pat,’ or .Patty.’“.Oh, yes! Jill has spoken of her ... and thinks very highly of her. Nevermentioned her tattoos, however. Probably didn’t think it was relevant. Orperhaps none of my business.“.But she’s nearly the right age to be your friend. She says. When I said .babe’\n 　　I was again giving a first impression. She looks to be in her twenties; sheclaims her oldest child is that old. Anyhow, she trotted up to meet me, all bigsmile, put her anns around me and kissed me. .You’re Ben, I know.\n 　　Welcome, brother! I give you water!’\n 　　.You know me, Jubal. I’ve been in the newspaper racket for years- I’ve beenaround. But I had never been kissed by a totally strange babe dressed only intattoos . . . who was determined to be as friendly and affectionate as a colliepup. I was embarrassed.“.Poor Ben. My heart bleeds.“.Damn it, you would have felt the same way.“.No. Remember, I’ve met one tattooed lady. They feel completely dressed inthose tattoos-and rather resent having to put on clothes. Or at least this wastrue of my friend Sadako. Japanese, she was. But of course the Japaneseare not body conscious the way we are.“.Well,“ Ben answered. .Pat isn’t exactly body conscious, either-just about hertattoos. She wants to be stuffed and mounted, nude, when she dies, as atribute to George.“.’George’?“.Sorry. Her husband. Up in heaven, to my relief ... although she talked abouthim as if he had just slipped out for a short beer. While she was behaving asif she expected a trial mounting and stuffing any moment. But, essentially,Pat is a lady . . . and she didn’t let me stay embarrassed-.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/349.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
