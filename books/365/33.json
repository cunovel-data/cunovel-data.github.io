{"id":32567,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"BEN CAXTON HAD AWAKENED not knowing where he was nor what time itwas. It was dark around him, perfectly quiet, he was lying on something soft. 　　Not a bed-where was he? 　　The night came back in a rush. The last he clearly remembered he had beenlying on the soft floor of the Innermost Temple, talking quietly and intimatelywith Dawn. She had taken him there, they had immersed, shared water,grown closer- Frantically he reached around him in the dark, found nothing. 　　.Dawn!“Light swelled softly to a gentle dimness. .Here, Ben.“.Oh! I thought you had gone!“.I didn’t intend to wake you.“ She was wearing-to his sudden and intensedisappointment-her robe of office. .I must go start the Sunrisers’ OuterService. Gillian isn’t back yet. As you know, it was a fairly big class.“Her words brought back to him things she had told him last night thingswhich, at the time, had upset him despite her gentle and quite logicalexplanations . . . and she had soothed his upset until he found himselfagreeing with her. He still was not quite straight in his mind he didn’t grok itall-but, yes, Jill was probably still busy with her rites as high priestess-a task,or perhaps a happy duty, that Dawn had offered to take for her. Ben felt atwinge that he really should have been sorry that Jill had refused, hadinsisted that Dawn get much needed rest. 　　But he did not feel sorry. .Dawn ... do you have to leave?“ He scrambled tohis feet, put his arms around her. 　　.I must go, Ben dear ... dear Ben.“ She melted up against him. 　　.Right now? In such a rush?“.There is never,“ she said softly, .that much hurry.“ Suddenly the robe nolonger kept them apart. He was too bemused to wonder what had become ofit. 　　He woke up a second time, found that the .little nest“ he was in lighted softlywhen he stood up. He stretched, discovered that he felt wonderful, thenlooked around the room for his shorts. They were not in sight and no way forthem to be out of sight. He tried to recall where he had left them . . . and hadno recollection of ever having taken them off. But he certainly had not wornthem into the water. Probably beside the pool in the Innermost Temple- Hemade a mental note to stop back there and pick them up, then went out andfound a bathroom. 　　Some minutes later, shaved, showered, and refreshed, he did remember tolook into the Innermost Temple, failed to find his shorts and decided thatsomebody, Patty maybe, had noticed them and put them near the outer doorwhere apparently everybody kept what they needed for street wear . . . saidto hell with it and grinned at himself for having made such a jittery old-maidissue last night out of wearing them or not. He needed them, here in theNest, the way he needed a second head. 　　Come to think of it, he didn’t have the slightest trace of a head-a hangoverhead-although he recalled that he had had more than several drinks withDawn. Hadn’t got drunk, as he recalled, but certainly more than he ordinarilyallowed himself-he couldn’t sop up the stuff the way Jubal did without payingfor it. 　　Dawn didn’t seem to be affected by liquor at all-which was probably why hehad gone over his usual quota. Dawn . . . what a gal, what a gal! She hadn’teven seemed annoyed when, in a moment of emotional confusion, he hadcalled her Jill-she had seemed pleased. 　　He found no one in the big room and wondered what time it was? Not that hegave a damn, except that his stomach told him that it was long past breakfasttime. He went into the kitchen to see what he could scrounge. 　　A man in there looked up as he came in. .Ben!“.Well! Hi, Duke!“Duke gave him a bear hug and slapped him on the back. .Ben, you’re a sightfor sore eyes! Gosh, it’s good to see you. Thou art God. How do you like youreggs?“.Thou art God. Are you the cook?“.Only when I can’t find somebody else to do it for me-such as right now. Tonydoes most of it. We all do some. Even Mike unless Tony catches him andchases him out-Mike is the world’s worst cook, bar none.“ Duke went onbreaking eggs into a dish. 　　Ben moved in on the job. .You look after toast and coffee. Any Wocestershiresauce around here?“.You name it, Pat’s got it. Here.“ Duke added, .I looked in on you a half hourago, but you were still sawing wood. I’ve been busy or you’ve been busy eversince you got here-until now.“.What do you do around here, Duke? Aside from cooking when you can’tavoid it?“.Well, I’m a deacon ... and I’ll be a priest someday. But I’m slow-not that itmatters. I study Martian . . . everybody does that. And I’m the fix-it boy, sameas I was for Jubal“.Must take quite a gang to maintain a place this size.“.Ben, you’d be surprised how little it takes. Aside from keeping an eye on theplumbing-and sometime you must see Mike’s unique way of dealing with astopped toilet-I don’t have to play plumber very much. Aside from plumbing,ninety percent of the gadgetry in this building is right here in the kitchen . . . 　　and it’s not as gadgeted as Jubal’s kitchen.“.I had the impression that you have some very complicated gadgets for someof the temple ceremonies.“.Uuh uh, nary a gadget. Some lighting controlS, that’s all, and simple ones. 　　Actually“ Duke grinned. .-One of my most important jobs is no job at all. Firewarden“.Huh?“.I’m a licensed deputy fire warden, examined and everything, and same forsanitation and safety inspector-neither one takes any work. But it means thatwe never have to let an outsider go through the joint-and we don’t. Theyattend outer services...but they never get any farther unless Mike gives an upcheck.“They transferred food to plates and sat down at a table. Duke said, .You’restaying, aren’t you, Ben?“.I don’t see how I can, Duke.“.Mmmm . . . I had hoped that you would have more sense than I had. I camefor just a short visit, too . . went back and moped around for nearly a monthbefore I told Jubal I was leaving and wouldn’t be back. But never mind; you’llbe back. Don’t make any final decisions before the water sharing tonight.“.Didn’t Dawn tell you? Or Jill?“.Uh ... I don’t think so.“.Then they didn’t. Hmm, maybe i should let Mike explain it. No, no need to;people will be mentioning it to you all day long. Sharing water you grok, ofcourse; you’re one of the First Called.“.’First Called?’ Dawn used that expression.“.That handful of us who became Mike’s water brothers without learningMartian. The others ordinarily do not share water and grow closer until theypass from the Seventh Circle to the Eighth . . . and by that time they arebeginning to think in Martian. Heck, some of them know more Martian by thatstage than I do now, since I’m a .First Called’ myself and started my studiesafter I was already in the Nest. Oh, it’s not actually forbidden to share waterwith someone who isn’t ready for Eighth Circle. Hell, if I wanted to, I couldpick up a babe in a bar, share water with her, then take her to bed—and thentake her to the Temple and start her on her apprentisship But I wouldn’t wantto. That’s the point; I wouldn’t even want to. At the very most I might decidethat it was worth while to bring her around to an outer service and let Mikelook her over and find out whether any of it clicked with her. Ben, I’ll make aflat-footed prediction. You’ve been around a lot—I’m sure you’ve been insome fancy beds with some fancy babes.“.Uh . . some,“.I know damn’ well you have. But you will never again in your life crawl in withone who is not your water brother.“.Hmm.“.You’ll see. Let’s cheek it a year from now and you tell me. Now Mike maydecide that someone is ready to share water before that person reacheseven Seventh Circle. One couple we’ve got in the Nest, Mike picked, andoffered them Water, when they had just entered Third Circle and now he’s apriest and she’s a priestess . . . Sam and Ruth.“.Haven’t met .em.“.You will. Tonight at the latest. But Mike is the only one who can be certain,that soon. Very occasionally Dawn, and sometimes Patty, will spot somebodyfor special promotion and special training . . but never as far down as ThirdCircle and I’m pretty sure that they always consult Mike before going ahead. 　　Not that they are required to. Anyhow, into the Eighth Circle . . . and sharingand growing closer starts. Then, sooner or later, into Ninth Circle, and theNest itself—and that’s the service we mean when we say .Sharing Water’ 　　even though we share water all day long. The whole Nest attends and thenew brothers—usually it’s a couple—becomes forever part of the Nest. Inyour case you already are . . , but we’ve never held the service for you, soeverything else is being pushed aside tonight while we welcome you. Theydid the same for me.“ Duke got a faraway look. .Ben, it’s the most wonderfulfeeling in the world“.But I still don’t know what it is, Duke.“.Uh ...it’s a lot of things. Ever been on a real luau of a party, the kind the copsraid and usually ends up in a divorce or two?“.Well ... yes.“.Up to now, brother, you’ve only been on Sunday School picnics. That’s oneaspect of it. Have you ever been married?“.No.“.You are married. You just don’t know it yet. After tonight there will neveragain be any doubt in your mind about it.“ Duke again looked faraway,happily pensive. .Ben, I was married before ... and for a short time it waspretty nice and then it was steady hell on wheels. This time I like it, all thetime. Shucks, I love it! And look, Ben, I don’t mean just that it’s fun to beshacked up with a bunch of bouncy babes. I love them-all my brothers, bothsexes. Take Patty-and you willi-Patty mothers all of us . . . and I don’t thinkanybody, man or woman, gets over needing that, even if they think they’veoutgrown it. Patty . . . well, Patty is just swell! She reminds me of Jubal . . . 　　and that old bastard had better get down here and get the word! My point isthat it is not just that Patty is female. Oh, I’m not running down tail-. 　　.Who is running down tail?“ The voice, a rich contralto, came from behindthem. 　　Duke swung around. .Not me, you limber Levantine whore! Come here,babe, and kiss your brother Ben.“.Never charged for it in my life,“ the woman denied as she glided towardthem. .Started giving it away before anybody told me.“ She kissed Bencarefully and thoroughly. .Thou art God, brother.“.Thou art God. Share water.“.Never thirst. And don’t ever pay any mind to what Duke says- from the wayhe behaves he must have been a bottle baby.“ She leaned over Duke andkissed him even more lingeringly while he patted her ample fundament. Bennoted that she was short, plump, brunette almost to swarthiness, and had amane of heavy blue-black hair almost to her waist .Duke, did you seeanything of a Ladies’ Home Journal when you got up?“ She reached past hisshoulder, took his fork and started eating his scrambled eggs. .Mmm ... good. 　　You didn’t cook these, Duke.“.Ben did. What in the world would I want with a Ladies’ Home Journal?“.Ben, stir up a couple of dozen more exactly the same way and I’ll scramble.em in relays. There was an article in it I wanted to show Patty, dear.“.Okay,“ agreed Ben and got up to do it. 　　.Don’t you two get any ideas about redecorating this dump or I’m moving out. 　　And leave some of those eggs for me! You think us men can do our work onmush?“.Tut, tut, Dukie darling. Water divided is water multiplied. As I was saying,Ben, Duke’s complaints never mean anything-as long as he has enoughwomen for two men and enough food for three, he’s a perfect little lamb.“ Sheshoved one forkful into Duke’s mouth, went on eating the rest herself. .Soquit making faces, brother; I’m about to cook you a second breakfast. Or willthis be your third?“.Not even the first, yet. You ate ~. Ruth, I was telling Ben how you and Sampole-vaulted from Third to Ninth. I think he’s uneasy about whether hebelongs in the Sharing-Water tonight.“She pursued the last bite on Duke’s plate, then moved over and startedpreparations to cook. .Duke, you run along and I’ll send you out somethingother than mush. Take your coffee cup and skedaddle. Ben, I was worried,too, when my time came-but don’t you be worried, dear, because Michaeldoes not make mistakes. You belong here or you wouldn’t be here. You’regoing to stay?“.Uh, I can’t. Ready for the first installment?“.Pour them in. Then you’ll be back. And someday you’ll stay. Duke is correct-Sam and I pole-vaulted . . . and it was almost too fast for a middle-aged, primand proper housewife.“.Middle-aged?“.Ben, one of the bonuses about the discipline is that as it straightens out yoursoul, your body straightens out, too. That’s a matter in which the ChristianScientists are precisely right. Notice any medicine bottles in any of thebathrooms?“.Uh, no.“.There aren’t any. How many people have kissed you?“.Several, at least.“.As a priestess I kiss a lot more than .several,’ believe me. But there’s neverso much as a sniffle in the Nest. I used to be the sort of whiny woman who isnever quite well and given to .female complaints.’“ She smiled. .Now I’mmore female than ever but I’m twenty pounds lighter and years younger andhave nothing to complain about-I like being female. As Duke flattered me, .aLevantine whore’ and unquestionably much more limber than I was-I alwayssit in the lotus position when I’m teaching a class, whereas it used to be all Icould do just to squat down and straighten up again . . . hot flashes anddizziness. 　　.But it did happen fast,“ Ruth went on. .Sam was a professor of Orientallanguages at the University here-the city U., that is. Sam started coming tothe Temple because it was a way, the only way, to learn the Martianlanguage. Strictly professional motivation, he wasn’t interested in it as achurch. And I went along to keep an eye on him . . . I had heard rumors and Iwas a jealous wife, even more possessive than the average. 　　.So we worked up to the Third Circle, Sam learning the language rapidly, ofcourse, and myself grimly hanging on and studying hard because I didn’twant to let him out of my sight. Then boom! the miracle happened. Wesuddenly began to think in it, just a little . . . and Michael felt it and had usstay after service, a Third Circle service, one night and Michael and Gilliangave us water. Afterwards, I knew that I was all the things I had despised inother women and I knew that I should despise my husband for letting me doit and hate him for what he had done himself. All this in English, with the wontparts in Hebrew. So I wept all day and moaned and made myself a stinkingnuisance to Sam . . . and couldn’t wait to get back to share more water andgrow closer again that night. 　　.After that things were steadily easier but not easy, as we were pushedthrough all the inner circles just as rapidly as we could take it; Michael knewthat we needed help and wanted to get us into the safety and peace of theNest. So when it came time for our Sharing.Water, I was still unable todiscipline myself without constant help. I knew that I wanted to be receivedinto the Nest-once you start, there’s no turning back-but I wasn’t sure I couldmerge myself with seven other people. I was scared silly; on the way over Ialmost begged Sam to turn around and go home.“She stopped talking and looked up, unsmiling but beatific, a plump angle witha big stirring spoon in one hand. .Then we walked into the Innermost Templeand a spotlight hit me and our robes were whisked away . . . and they wereall in the pool and calling out to us in Martian to come, come and share thewater of life-and I stumbled into that pool and submerged and I haven’t comeup since! 　　.Nor ever want to. Don’t fret, Ben, you’ll learn the language and acquire thediscipline and you’ll have loving help from all of us every step of the way. Youstop worrying and jump in that pool tonight; I’ll have my arms out to catchyou. All of us will have our arms out, welcoming you home. Now take thisplate in to Duke and tell him I said he was a pig but a charming one. And takethis one in for yourself-oh, of course you can eat that much!-give me a kissand run along; Ruthie has work to do.“Ben delivered the kiss and the message and the plate, then found that he didhave some appetite left . . . but nevertheless did not concentrate on food ashe found Jill stretched out, apparently asleep, on one of the wide, softcouches. He sat down opposite her, enjoying the sweet sight of her andthinking that Dawn and Jill were even more alike than he had realized thenight before. 　　He looked up from a bite and saw that her eyes were open and she wassmiling at him. .Thou art God, darling-and that smells good.“.And you look good. But I didn’t mean to wake you.“ He got up and sat byher, put a bite in her mouth. .My own cooking, with Ruth’s help.“.I know. And good, too. Duke told me to stay out of the kitchen becauseRuthie was giving you a good-for-your-soul lecture. You didn’t wake me; Iwas just lazing until you came out. I haven’t been asleep all night.“.Not at all?“.Not a wink. But I’m not tired, I feel grand. Just hungry. That’s a hint.“ So hefed her. She let him do so, never stirring, not using her own hands. .But didyou get any sleep?“ she asked presently. 　　.Uh, some.“.Enough? No, you got enough. But how much sleep did Dawn get? Asmuch as two hours?“.Oh, more than that, I’m certain.“.Then she’s all right. Two hours of sleep does us as much good as eightused to. I knew what a sweet night you were going to have-both of you-but Iwas a teeny bit worried that she might not rest.“.Well, it was a wonderful night,“ Ben admitted, .although I was, uh, surprisedat the way you shoved her at me.“.Shocked, you mean. I know you, Ben, maybe better than you know yourself. 　　You arrived here yesterday with jealousy sticking out in lumps. I think it’sgone now. Yes?“He looked back at her. .I think so.“.That’s good. I had a wonderful and joyous night, too-made free from anyworry by knowing you were in good hands. The best hands- better thanmine.“.Oh, no!“.Hmm. I grok a few lumps still-but tonight we’ll wash them away in water.“She sat up, reached toward the end of the couch-and it looked to Canon as ifa pack of cigarettes on the end table jumped the last few inches into herhand. 　　.You seemed to have picked up some sleight-of-hand tricks, too.“She seemed momentarily puzzled, then she smiled. .Some. Nothing much. 　　Parlor tricks. .I am only an egg,’ to quote my teacher.“.How did you do that trick?“.Why, I just whistled to it in Martian. First you grok a thing, then you grokwhat you want it to-Mike!“ She waved. .We’re over here, dear!“.Coming.“ The Man from Mars came straight to Ben, took his hands, pulledhim to his feet. .Let me look at you, Ben! Golly, it’s good to see you!“.It’s good to see you. And to be here.“.And we’re going to twist your arm to keep you here. What’s this about threedays? Three days indeed!“.I’m a working man, Mike.“.We’ll see. The girls are all excited, getting ready for your party tonight. Mightjust as well shut down services and classes for the rest of the day-they won’tbe worth a damn.“.Patty has already done any necessary rescheduling,“ Jill told Mike. .She justdidn’t bother you with it. Dawn and Ruth and Sam are going to take care ofwhat’s necessary. Patty decided to slough the Outer matinee- so you’rethrough for the day.“.That’s good news.“ Mike sat down, pulled Jill’s head into his lap, pulled Bendown, put an arm around him, and sighed. He was dressed as Ben had seenhim in the outer meeting, smart tropical business suit, lacking only shoes. 　　.Ben, don’t ever take up preaching. I spend my days and nights rushing from.Could be.“ Caxton was finding that their unself-conscious behavior wasbeginning to embarrass him, even in this uniquely relaxed atmosphere-hewished that they would either knock off necking . . . or give him an excuse toleave. 　　Instead Mike went right on cuddling Jill with one hand while keeping his otherarm snug around Ben’s waist . . . and Ben was forced to admit that Jillencouraged him, rather than otherwise. Mike said very seriously, .Ben, anight like last night-helping a group to make the big jump to Eighth Circlegetsme terribly keyed up. Let me tell you something out of the lessons forSixth, Ben. We humans have something that my former people don’t evendream of. They can’t. And I can tell you how precious it is . . . how especiallyprecious I know it to be, because I have known what it is not to have it. Theblessing of being male and female. Man and Woman created He them-thegreatest treasure We-Who-Are-God ever invented. Right, Jill?“.Beautifully right, Mike-and Ben knows it is Truth. But make a song forDawn, too, darling.“one job to another, telling people why they must never hurry. I owe you,along with Jill and Jubal, more than anyone else on this planet-yet you’vebeen here since yesterday afternoon and this is the first time I’ve been ableto say hello. How’ve you been? You’re looking fit. In fact Dawn tells me youare fit.“Ben found himself blushing. .I’m okay.“.That’s good. Because, believe me, the hill tribes will be restless tonight. ButI’ll grok close and sustain you. You’ll be fresher at the end of the party than atthe start-won’t he, Little Brother?“.Yes,“ agreed Jill. .Ben, you won’t believe it until you’ve had it done for you,but Mike can lend you strength-physical strength, I mean, not just moralsupport. I can do it a little bit. Mike can really do it.“.Jill can do it quite a lot.“ Mike caressed her. .Little Brother is a tower ofstrength to everybody. Last night she certainly was.“ He smiled down at her,then sang: 　　.You’ll never find a girl like Jill. 　　.No, not one in a billion.“.Of all the tarts who ever will .The willingest is our Gillian!-isn’t that right, LittleBrother?“.Pooh,“ answered Jill, obviously pleased, covering his hand with her own andpressing it to her. .Dawn is exactly like me and you know it- and every bit aswilling.“.Maybe. But you’re here ... and Dawn is downstairs interviewing thepossibles out of the tip. She’s busy-you ain’t. That’s an important differenceisn’tit, Ben?“.Okay- .Ardent is our lovely Dawn;“Ben grokked that in her glance- .She buysnew dresses every morn. .But never shops for pants!“ Jill giggled andsquirmed. .Did you tune her in?“.Yes, and she gave me a big Bronx cheer-with a kiss behind it for Ben. Say,isn’t there anybody in the kitchen this morning? I just remembered I haven’teaten for a couple of days. Or years, maybe; I’m not sure.“.I think Ruth is,“ Ben said, untangling himself and standing up. .I’ll go see.“.Duke can do it. Hey, Duke! See if you can ~nd somebody who’ll fix me astack of wheat cakes as tall as you are and a gallon of maple syrup.“.Right, Mike!“ Duke called back. 　　Ben Caxton hesitated, without an excuse to run an errand. He thought of atrumped-up excuse and glanced back over his sboulder. 　　.Jubal,“ Caxton said earnestly, .I wouldn’t tell you this part at all if it weren’tessential to explaining how I feel about the whole thing, why I’m worriedabout them-all of them, Duke and Mike as well as Jill and Mike’s othervictims, too. By that morning I was myself half conned into thinkingeverything was all right-Weird as bell in spots-but jolly. Mike himself had mefascinated, too-his new personalitY is pretty powerful. Cocky and too muchsupersalesman . . but very compelling. Then he-or both of them-got merather embarassed, so 1 took that chance to get up from the couch. 　　.Then I glanced back-and couldn’t believe my eyes. I hadn’t been tu~ncdaway five seconds . . and Mike bad managed to get rid of every stitch ofclothes . . . and so help me, they were going to it, with myself and three orfour others in the room at the time-just as boldly as monkeys in a zoo! 　　.Jubal, I was so shocked I almost lost my breakfast.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/351.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
