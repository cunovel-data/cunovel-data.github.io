Smart and withstyle-the lad finished in style.“Jubal looked around at his brothers. Was he the only one who felt anything?\n 　　Jill and Dawn were seated each with an arm around the other- but they didthat whenever they were together; neither one seemed disturbed. EvenDorcas was dry-eyed and calm.\n 　　The inferno in the tank cut to smiling Happy Holiday who said, .And now,folks, a few moments for our friends at Elysian Fields who so graciously gaveup their-. Patty cut him off.\n 　　.Anne and Duke are on their way back up,“ she said. .I’ll let them through thefoyer and then we’ll have lunch.“ She started to leave.\n 　　Jubal stopped her. .Patty? Did you know what Mike was going to do?“She seemed puzzled. .Huh? Why, of course not, Jubal. It was necessary towait for fullness. None of us knew.“ She turned and left.\n 　　.Jubal-. Jill was looking at hint. .Jubal our beloved father please stop andgrok the fullness. Mike is not dead. How can he be dead when no one can bekilled? Nor can he ever be away from us who have already grokked him.\n 　　Thou art God.“.’Thou art God,’“ he repeated dully.\n 　　.That’s better. Come sit with Dawn and me-in the middle.“.No. No, just let me be.“ He went blindly to his own room, let himself in andbolted the door after him, leaned heavily with both hands gripping the foot ofthe bed. My son, oh my son! Would that I had died for thee! He had had somuch to live for . . . and an old fool that he respected too much had to shootoff his yap and goad him into a needless, useless martyrdom. If Mike hadgiven them something big-like stereo, or bingo-but he gave them the Truth.\n 　　Or a piece of the Truth. And who is interested in Truth? He laughed throughhis sobs.\n 　　After a while he shut them off, both heart-broken sobs and bitter laugh, andpawed through his traveling bag. He had what he wanted with him; he hadkept a supply in his toilet kit ever since Joe Douglas’s stroke had remindedhim that all flesh is grass.\n 　　Well, now his own stroke had come and he couldn’t take it. He prescribedthree tablets for himself to make it fast and certain, washed them down withwater, and lay quickly on the bed. Shortly the pain went away.\n 　　From a great distance the voice reached him. .Jubal-.\n 　　.’M resting, Don’ bother me.“.Jubal! Please, Father!“.Uh ... yes, Mike? What is it?“.Wake up! Fullness is not yet. Here, let me help you.“Jubal sighed. .Okay, Mike“ He let himself be helped and led into the bath, lethis head be held while he threw up, accepted a glass of water and rinsed outhis mouth.\n 　　.Okay now?“.Okay, son. Thanks.“.Then I’ve got some things to attend to. I love you, Father. Thou art God.“.I love you, Mike. Thou art God.“ Jubal puttered around for a while longer,making himself presentable, changing his clothes, taking one short brandy tokill the slightly bitter taste still in his stomach, then went out to join the others.\n 　　Patty was alone in the room with the babble tank and it was switched off. Shelooked up. .Some lunch now, Jubal?“.Yes, thanks.“She came up to him. .That’s good. I’m afraid most of them simply ate andscooted. But each of them left a kiss for you. And here it is, all in onepackage.“ She managed to deliver in full all the love placed in her proxycemented together with her own; Jubal found that it left him feeling strong,with her own serene acceptance shared, no bitterness left.\n 　　.Come out into the kitchen,“ she said. .Tony’s gone so most of the rest arethere-not that his growls ever really chased anybody out anyhow.“ Shestopped and tried to stare down the back of her neck. .Isn’t that final scenechanging a little? Sort of smoky, maybe?“Jubal solemnly agreed that he thought it was. He couldn’t see any changehimself . . . but he was not going to argue with Patty’s idiosyncrasy. Shenodded. .I expected it. I can see around me all right-except myself. I stillneed a double mirror to see my back clearly. Mike says my Sight will includethat presently. No matter.“In the kitchen perhaps a dozen were lounging at a table and elsewhere; Dukewas standing at the range, stirring a small sauce pan. .Hi, Boss. I ordered atwenty-place bus. That’s the biggest that can land on our little landing flat . . .\n 　　and we’ll need one almost that big, what with the diaper set and Patty’s pets.\n 　　Okay?“.Certainly. Are they all coming home now?“ If they ran out of bedrooms, thegirls could make up dosses that would do in the living room and here andthere-and this crowd would probably double up mostly anyhow. Come tothink of it, he might not be allowed to sleep solo himself and he made up hismind not to fight it. It was friendly to have a warm body on the other side ofthe bed, even if your intentions weren’t active. By God, he had forgotten howfriendly it was! Growing closer- .Not everybody. Tim will pilot us, then turn inthe bus and go to Texas for a while. The Skipper and Beatrix and Sven we’resimply going to drop off in New Jersey.“Sam looked up from the table. .Ruth and I have got to get back to our kids.\n 　　And Saul is coming with us.“.Can’t you stop by home for a day or two first?“.Well, maybe. I’ll talk it over with Ruth.“.Boss,“ put in Duke, .how soon can we fill the swimming pool?“.Well, we never filled it earlier than the first of April before-but with the newheaters I suppose we could fill it anytime.“ Jubal added, .But we’ll still havesome nasty weather-snow still on the ground yesterday.“.Boss, lemme clue you. This gang can walk through snow hip deep on a tallgiraffe and not notice it-and will, to swim. Besides that, there are cheaperways of keeping that water from freezing than with those big oil heaters.“.Jubal!“.Yes, Ruth?“.We’ll stop for a day or maybe more. The kids don’t miss me-and I’m notaching to take over being motherly without Patty to discipline them anyhow.\n 　　Jubal, you’ve never really seen me until you’ve seen me with my hair floatingaround me in the water-looking like Mrs. DoAsYouWouldBeDoneBy.“.It’s a date. Say, where is the Squarehead and the Dutchman? Beatrix hasnever been home-they can’t be in such a hurry.“.I’ll tell .em, Boss.“.Patty, can your snakes stand a clean, warm basement for a while? Until wecan do better? I don’t mean Honey Bun, of course; she’s people. But I don’tthink the cobras should have the run of the house.“.Of course, Jubal.“.Mmm-. Jubal looked around. .Dawn, can you take shorthand?“.She doesn’t need it,“ put in Anne, .anymore thab I do.“.I see. I should have known. Use a typewriter?“.I will learn, if you wish it,“ Dawn answered.\n 　　.Consider yourself hired-until there’s a vacancy for a high priestesssomewhere. Jill, have we forgotten anybody?“.No, Boss. Except that all those who have left feel free to camp on youanytime, too. And they will.“.I assumed that. Nest number two, when and as needed.“ He went over tothe range and joined Duke, glanced into the pan he was stirring. It held asmall amount of broth. .Hmm ... Mike?“.Yup.“ Duke dipped out a little in the spoon, tasted it. .Needs a little salt.“.Yes, Mike always did need a little seasoning.“ Jubal took the spoon andtasted the broth. Duke was correct; the flavor was sweet and could haveused salt. .But let’s grok him as he is, Who’s left to share?“.Just you. Tony left me here with strict instructions to stir by hand, add wateras needed, and wait for you. Not to let it scorch.“.Then grab a couple of cups. We’ll share it and grok together.“.Right, Boss.“ Two cups came sailing down and rested by the sauce pan.\n 　　.This is a joke on Mike-he always swore that he would outlive me and serveme up for Thanksgiving. Or maybe the joke’s on me-because we had a beton it and now I can’t collect.“.You won only by default. Split it evenly.“Duke did so. Jubal raised his cup. .Share!“.Grow ever closer.“Slowly they drank the broth, stretching it out, savoring it, praising andcherishing and grokking their donor. Jubal found, to his surpriser thatalthough he was overflowing with emotion, it was a calm happiness that didnot bring tears. What a quaint and gawky puppy his son had been when firsthe saw him . . . so eager to please, so naive in his little mistakes-and what aproud power he had become without ever losing his angelic innocence. I grokyou at last, son-and would not change a line!\n 　　Patty had his lunch waiting for him; he sat down and dug in, hungry andfeeling that it bad been days since breakfast. Sam was saying, .I was tellingSaul that I grok no need to make any change in plans. We go on as before. Ifyou’ve got the right merchandise, the business grows, even though thefounder has passed on.“.I wasn’t disagreeing,“ Saul objected. .You and Ruth will found anothertemple-and we’ll found others. But we’ll have to take time now to accumulatecapital. This isn’t a street corner revival, nor yet something to set up in avacant shop; it requires staging and equipment. That means money-not tomention such things as paying for a year or two on Mars for Stinky andMaryam . . . and that’s just as essential.“.All right already! Who’s arguing? We wait for fullness ... and go ahead.“Jubal said suddenly, .Money’s no problem.“.How’s that, Jubal?“.As a lawyer I shouldn’t tell this ... but as a water brother I do what I grok.\n 　　Just a moment-Anne.“.Yes, Boss.“.Buy that spot. The one where they stoned Mike. Better get about a hundredfootradius around it.“.Boss, the spot itself is public parkway. A hundred-foot radius will cut offsome public road and a piece of the hotel grounds.“.Don’t argue.“.I wasn’t arguing, I was giving you facts.“.Sorry. They’ll sell. They’ll reroute that road. Hell, if their arms are twistedproperly, they’ll donate the ~~nd-twisting done through Joe Douglas, I think.\n 　　And have Joe Douglas claim from the morgue whatever was left when thoseghouls got through with him and we’ll bury him right on that spot-say a yearfrom now . . . with the whole city mourning and the cops that didn’t protecthim today standing at attention.“ What to put over him? The Fallen Caryatid?\n 　　No, Mike had been strong enough for his stone. The Little Mermaid would bebetter-but it wouldn’t be understood. Maybe one of Mike himself, just as hewas when he had said, .Look at me. I am a Son of Man.“ If Duke didn’t catcha shot of it, New World did-and maybe there was a brother, or would be abrother, with the spark of Rodin in him to do it right and not fancy it up.\n 　　.We’ll bury him there,“ Jubal went on, .unprotectS~ and let the worms andthe gentle rain grok him. I grok Mike will like that. Anne, I want to talk to JoeDouglas as soon as we get home.“.Yes, Boss. We grok with you.“.Now about that other.“ He told them about Mike’s will. .So you see, eachone of you is at least a millionaire-Just how much more than that I haven’testimated lately . . . but much more, even after taxes. No strings on it at all . .\n 　　. but I grok that you will spend as needed for temples and similar stuff. Butthere’s nothing to stop you from buying yachts if you wish. Oh, yes! JoeDouglas stays on as manager for any who care to let the capital ride, samepay as before . . . but I grok Joe won’t last long, whereupon managementdevolves on Ben Caxton. Ben?“Caxton shrugged. .It can be in my name. I grok I’ll hire me a real businessman, name of Saul.“.That wraps it then. Some waiting time but nobody will dare really fight thiswill; Mike rigged it. You’ll see. How soon can we get out of here? Is the tabsettled’?“.Jubal,“ Ben said gently, .we own this hotel.“Not long thereafter they were in the air, with no trouble from police-the townhad quieted down as fast as it had flared up. Jubal sat forward with StinkyMabmoud and relaxed-discovered that he was not tired, not unhappy, noteven fretting to get back to his sanctuary. He discussed with Mahinoud hisplans to go to Mars to learn the language more deeply after, Jubal waspleased to learn, completing the work on the dictionary, which Mahinoudestimated at about a year more for his own part in checking the phoneticspellings.\n 　　Jubal said grumpily, .I suppose I shall be forced to learn the pesky stuffmyself, just to understand the chatter going on around me.“.As you grok, brother.“.Well, damn it, I won’t put up with assigned lessons and regular school hours!\n 　　I’ll work as suits me, just as I always have.“Mabmoud was silent a few moments. .Jubal, we used classes and schedulesat the Temple because we were handling groups. But some got specialattention.“.That’s what I’m going to need.“.Anne, for example, is much, much farther along than she ever let you know.\n 　　With her totahrecall memory, she learned Martian in nothing flat, hooked inrapport with Mike.“.Well, I don’t have that sort of memory-and Mike’s not available.“.No, but Anne is. And, stubborn as you are, nevertheless Dawn can placeyou in rapport with Aiine-if you’ll let her. And you won’t need Dawn for thesecond lesson; Anne will then be able to handle it all. You’ll be thinking inMartian inside of days, by the calendar-much longer by subjective time, butwho cares?“ Mahmoud leered at him. .You’ll enjoy the warming-upexercises.“Jubal bristled. .You’re a low, evil, lecherous Arab-and besides that you stoleone of my best secretaries.“.For which I am forever in your debt. But you haven’t lost her entirely; she’llgive you lessons, too. She’ll insist on it.“.Now go .way and find another seat. I want to think.“Somewhat later be shouted, .Front!“Dorcas came forward and sat down beside bini, steno gear ready.\n 　　He glanced at her before he started to work. .Child, you look even happierthan usual. Glowing.“Dorcas said dreamily, .I’ve decided to name him .Dennis.’“ Jubal nodded.\n 　　.Appropriate. Very appropriate.“ Appropriate meaning even if’ she weremixed up about the paternity, he thought to himself. .Do you feel likeworking?“.Oh, yes! I feel grand.“.Begin. Stereoplay. Rough draft. Working title: .A Martian Named Smith.’\n 　　Opener: zoom in on Mars, using stock or bonestelled shots, unbrokensequence, then dissolving to miniature matched set of actual landing place ofEnvoy.
