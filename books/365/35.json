The Martians havereleased him.“Digby looked puzzled. .I’m sorry. There was some young creaturetoward whom I have a Duty?“Foster smiled angelically. Miracles were never necessary-in Truth thepseudo-concept .miracle“ was self-contradicting. But these young fellowsalways had to learn it for themselves. .Never mind,“ he said gently. .It’s aminor job and I’ll handle it myself-and Junior?“.Sir?“.Call me .Fog,’ please-ceremony is all right in the field but we don’t need it inthe studio. And remind me not to call you .Junior’ after this- you made a verynice record on that temporary duty assignment. Which name do you like tobe called?“His assistant blinked. .I have another name?“.Thousands of them. Do you have a preference?“.Why, I really don’t recall at this eon.“.Well ... how would you like to be called .Digby’?“.Uh, yes. That’s a very nice name. Thanks.“.Don’t thank me. You earned it.“ Archangel Foster turned back to his work,not forgetting the minor item he had assumed. Briefly he considered how thiscup might be taken from little Patricia-then chided himself for suchunprofessional, almost human, thought. Mercy was not possible to an angel;angelic compassion left no room for it.\n 　　The Martian Old Ones had reached an elegant and awesome trial solution totheir major esthetic problem and put it aside for a few filledthrees to let itgenerate new problems. At which time, unhurriedly but at once and almostabsent-mindedly, the alien nestling which they had returned to his properworld was tapped of what he had learned of his people and dropped, aftercherishing, since he was of no further interest to their purposes.\n 　　They collectively took the data he had accumulated and, with a view totesting that trial solution, began to work toward considering an inquiry leadingto an investigation of esthetic parameters involved in the possibility of theartistic necessity of destroying Earth. But necessarily much waiting would be,before fullness would grok decision.\n 　　The Daibutsu at Kamakura was again washed by a giant wave secondary toa seismic disturbance some 280 kilometers off Honshu. The wave killed morethan 13,000 people and lodged a small male infant high up in the Buddhaimage’s interior, where it was eventually found and succored by survivingmonks. This infant lived ninety-seven Terran years after the disaster thatwiped out his family, and himself produced no progeny nor anything of anynote aside from a reputation reaching to Yokohama for loud and sustainedbelching. Cynthia Duchess entered a nunnery with all benefits of modernpublicity and left same without fanfare three days later. Ex-Secretary GeneralDouglas suffered a slight stroke which impaired the use of his left hand butdid not reduce his ability to conserve assets entrusted to his stewardship.\n 　　Lunar Enterprises, Ltd., published a prospectus on a bond issue for thewholly owned subsidiary Ares Chandler Corporation. The Lyle-DriveExploratory Vessel Mary Jane Smith landed on Pluto. Fraser, Colorado,reported the coldest average February of its recorded history.\n 　　Bishop Oxtongue, speaking at the New Grand Avenue Temple in KansasCity, preached on the text (Matt. XXIV:24): .Por there shall arise false Christsand false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that,if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.“ He was careful to makeclear that his diatribe did not refer to Mormons, Christian Scientists, RomanCatholics, nor Fosterites-most especially not to the last-nor to any otherfellow travelers whose good works counted for more than minute and, in thefinal analysis, inconsequential differences in creed or ritual . - . but solely torecent upstart heretics who were seducing faithful contributors away from thefaiths of their fathers. In a lush subtropical resort city in the southern part ofthe same nation three complainants swore an information charging publiclewdness on the part of a pastor, three of his assistants, and Joe Doe, MaryRoe, et al., plus further charges of running a disorderly house andcontributing to the delinquency of minors. The county attorney had at firstonly the mildest interest in prosecuting under the information as he had onfile a dozen much like it- the complaining witnesses had always failed toappear at arraignment.\n 　　He pointed this out. Their spokesman said, .We know. But you’ll have plentyof backing this time. Supreme Bishop Short is determined that this Antichristshall flourish no longer.“The prosecutor was not interested in antichrists-but there was a primarycoming up. .Well, just remember I can’t do much without backing.“.You’ll have it.“Farther north, Dr. Jubal Harshaw was not immediately aware of this incidentand its consequences, but he did know of too many others for peace of mind.\n 　　Against his own rules he had succumbed to that most insidious drug, thenews. Thus far, he had contained his vice; he merely subscribed to a clippingservice instructed for .Man from Mars,“ .V. M. Smith,“ .Church of All Worlds,“and .Ben Caxton.“ But the monkey was crawling up his back-twice lately hehad had to fight off an impulse to order Larry to set up the babble box in hisstudy- Damn it, why couldn’t those kids tape him an occasional letter?-instead of letting him wonder and worry. .Front!“He heard Anne come in but he still continued to stare Out a window at snowand an empty swimming pool. .Anne,“ he said without turning around, .rentus a small tropical atoll and put this mausoleum up for sale.“.Yes, Boss. Anything else?“.But get that atoll tied down on a long-term lease before you hand thiswilderness back to the Indians; I will not put up with hotels. How long has itbeen since I wrote any pay copy?“.Forty-three days.“.You see? Let that be a lesson to you. Begin. .Death Song of a Wood’sColt’:\n 　　.The depths of winter longing are ice within my heartThe shards of broken covenants lie sharp against my soulThe wraiths of long-lost ecstasy still keep us two apartThe sullen winds of bitterness still keen from turn to pole.\n 　　.The scars and twisted tendons, the stumps of struck-off limbs,The aching pit of hunger and the throb of unset bone,My sanded burning eyeballs, as light within them dims,Add nothing to the torment of lying here alone.The shimmering flames of fever trace out your blessed faceMy broken eardrums echo yet your voice inside my headI do not fear the darkness that comes to me apaceI only dread the loss of you that comes when I am dead.\n 　　.There,“ he added briskly, .sign it .Louisa M. Alcott’ and have the agencysend it to Togetherness magazine.“.Boss, is that your idea of .pay copy’?“.Huh? Of course it isn’t. Not now. But it will be worth something later, so put itin file and my literary executor can use it to help settle the death duties.\n 　　That’s the catch in all artistic pursuits; the best work is always worth mostafter the workman can’t be paid. The literary life.- dreck! It consists inscratching the cat till it purrs.“.Poor Jubali Nobody ever feels sorry for him, so he has to feel sorry forhimself.“.Sarcasm yet. No wonder I don’t get any work done.“.Not sarcasm, Boss. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches.“.My apologies. All right, here’s pay copy. Begin. Title: .One for the Road,’\n 　　.There’s amnesia in a hang knot,And comfort in the ax,But the simple way of poison will make your nerves relax.\n 　　.There’s surcease in a gunshot,And sleep that comes from racks,But a handy draft of poison avoids the harshest tax.\n 　　.You find rest upon the hot squat,Or gas can give you pax,But the closest corner chemist has peace in packaged stacks.\n 　　.There’s refuge in the church lotWhen you tire of facing facts,And the smoothest route is poison prescribed by kindly quacks.\n 　　.Chorus-With an ugh! and a groan, and a kick of the heels,Death comes quiet, or it comes with squeals-But the pleasantest place to find your endIs a cup of cheer from the hand of a friend.“.Jubal,“ Anne said worriedly, .is your stomach upset?“.Always.“.That one’s for file, too?“.Huh? That’s for the New Yorker. Their usual pen name.“.They’ll bounce it.“.They’ll buy it. It’s morbid, they’ll buy it.“And besides, there’s something wrong with the scansion.“.Of course there is! You have to give an editor something to change, or hegets frustrated. After he pees in it himself, he likes the flavor much better, sohe buys it. Look, my dear, I was successfully avoiding honest work longbefore you were born-so don’t try to teach Granpaw how to suck eggs. Orwould you rather I nursed Abby while you turn Out copy? Hey! It’s Abigail’sfeeding time, isn’t it? And you weren’t .Front,’ Dorcas is .Front.’ I remember.“.It won’t hurt Abby to wait a few minutes. Dorcas is lying down. Morningsickness.“.Nonsense. If she’s pregnant, why won’t she let me run a test? Anne, I canspot pregnancy two weeks before a rabbit can-and you know it. I’m going tohave to be firm with that girl.“.Jubal, you let her be! She’s scared she didn’t catch ... and she wants to thinkshe did, as long as possible. Don’t you know anything about women?“.Mmm ... come to think about it-no. Not anything. All right, I won’t heckle her.\n 　　But why didn’t you bring our baby angel in and nurse her here? You haveboth hands free when you take dictation.“.In the first place, I’m glad I didn’t-she might have understood what youwere saying-.\n 　　.So I’m a bad influence, am I?“.She’s too young to see the marshmallow syrup underneath, Boss. But thereal reason is that you don’t do any work at all if I bring her in with me; youjust play with her.“.Can you think of any better way of enriching the empty hours?“.Jubal, I appreciate the fact that you are dotty over my daughter; I think she’spretty nice myself. But you’ve been spending all your time either playing withAbby . . . or moping. That’s not good.“.How soon do we go on relief?“.That’s beside the point. If you don’t crank out stories, you get spirituallyconstipated. It’s reached the point where Dorcas and Larry and I are bitingour nails-and when you do yell .Front!’ we jitter with relief. Only it’s always afalse alarm.“.If there’s money in the bank to meet the bills, what are you worriedabout?“.What are you worried about, Boss?“Jubal considered it. Should he tell her? Any possible doubt as to the paternityof Abigail had been settled, in his mind, in her naming; Anne had waveredbetween .Abigail“ and .Zenobia“-and had settled it by loading the infant withboth names. Anne had never mentioned the meanings of those names;presumably she did not know that he knew them.\n 　　Anne went on firmly, .You’re not fooling anyone but yourself; Jubal. Dorcasand Larry and I all know that Mike can take care of himself . and you ought toknow it. But because you’ve been so frenetic about it-.\n 　　.’Frenetic!’ Me?“.-Larry very quietly set up the stereo tank in his room and some one of usthree had been catching the news, every broadcast. Not because we areworried, for we aren’t-except about you. But when Mike gets into the newsandof course he does get into the news; he’s still the Man from Mars-weknow about it before those silly clippings ever reach you. I wish you wouldquit reading them.“.How do you know anything about any clippings? I went to a lot of trouble tosee that you didn’t. I thought.“.Boss,“ she said in a tired voice, .somebody has to dispose of the trash. Doyou think Larry can’t read?“.So. That confounded oubliette hasn’t worked right since Duke left. Damnit, nothing has!“.All you have to do is to send word to Mike that you want Duke to come back-Duke will show up at once.“.You know I can’t do that.“ It graveled him that what she said was almostcertainly true - . - and the thought was followed by a sudden and bittersuspicion. .Anne! Are you still here because Mike told you to stay?“She answered promptly, .I am here because I wish to be here.“.Mmmm ... not sure that’s a responsive answer.“.Jubal, sometimes I wish you were small enough to spank. May I finishwhat I was saying?“.You have the floor.“ Would any of them be here? Would Maryam havemarried Stinky and gone off to Beirut if Mike had not approved it? The name.Fatima Michele“ might be an acknowledgment of her adopted faith plus herhusband’s wish to compliment his closest friend-or it might be code almost asexplicit as baby Abby’s double name, one which stated that Mike wassomewhat more than godfather to the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Mahmoud. Ifso, did Stinky wear his antlers unaware? Or with serene pride as Joseph wasalleged to have done? Uh . . . but it must be concluded with utter certaintythat Stinky knew the minutes of his houri; water.brothershiP permitted noteven diplomatic omission of any matter so important. If indeed it wasimportant, which as a physician and agnostic Jubal doubted. But to them itwould be- .You aren’t listening.“.Sorry. Woolgathering.“ -and stop it, you nasty old man ... reading meaningsinto names that mothers give their children indeed! Next thing you’ll be takingup numerology - . . then astrology . . . then spiritualism-until your senility hasprogressed so far that all there is left is custodial treatment for a hulk too dimwittedto discorporate in dignity. Go to locked drawer nine in the clinic, code.Lethe“-and use at least two grains to be sure, although one is more thanenough- .There’s no need for you to read those clippings, because we knowthe public news about Mike before you do - . - and lien has given us a waterpromise to let us know any private news we need to know at once- and Mikeof course knows this. But, Jubal, Mike can’t be hurt. If you would only visit theNest, as we three have done, you would know this.“.I have never been invited.“.We didn’t have specilic invitations, either; we just went. Nobody has to havean invitation to go to his own home . . . any more than they require invitationsto come here. Like .The Death of the Hired Man.’ But you are just makingexcuses, Jubal, and poor ones . - . for Ben urged you to, and both Dawn andDuke sent word to you.“.Mike hasn’t invited me.“.Boss, that Nest belongs to me and to you quite as much as it does to Mike.\n 　　Mike is first among equals - . . as you are here. Is this Abby’s home?“.Happens,“ he answered evenly, .that title aheady vests in her with lifetimetenancy for me.“ Jubal had changed his own will, knowing that Mike’s willnow made it unnecessary to provide for any water brother of Mike. But notbeing sure of the exact .water’ status of this nestling- save that she wasusually wet-he had made redispositions in her favor and n favor ofdescendants, if any, of certain others. .I hadn’t intended to tell you, but thereis no harm in your knowing.“.Jubal ... you’ve made me cry. And you’ve almost made me forget what I wassaying. And I must say it. Mike would never hurry you, you know that. I grokhe is waiting for fullness-and I grok that you are, too.“.Mmmm ... I grok you speak rightly.“.All right. I think you are especially glum today simply because Mike hasbeen arrested again. But that’s happened many-.\n 　　.’Arrested?’ I hadn’t heard about this! What goes on?“ He added, .Damn it,girl-.\n 　　.Jubal, Jubal! Ben hasn’t called; that’s all we need to know. You know howmany times Mike has been arrested-in the army, as a carney, other placeshalfa dozen times as a preacher. He never hurts anybody; he just lets themdo it. They can never convict him and he gets out as soon as he wishes-atonce, if he wants to.“.What is it this time?“.Oh, the usual nonsense-public lewdness, statutory rape, conspiracy todefraud, keeping a disorderly house, contributing to the delinquency ofminors, conspiracy to evade the state truancy laws-.\n 　　.Huh?“.That involves their own nestlings’ school. Their license to operate aparochial school was canceled; the kids still didn’t go back to public school.\n 　　No matter, Jubal-none of it matters. The one thing on which they aretechnically in violation of the law-and so are you, Boss darling-can’t possiblybe proved. Jubal, if you had ever seen the Temple and the Nest you wouldknow that even the F.D.S. couldn’t sneak a spy-eye into it. So relax. After alot of publicity, charges will be dropped-and the crowds at the outer serviceswill be bigger than ever.“.Hmm! Anne, does Mike rig these persecutions himself?“She looked startled, an expression her face was unused to. .Why, I hadnever considered the possibility, Jubal. Mike can’t lie, you know.“.Does it involve lying? Suppose he planted perfectly true rumors abouthimself? But ones that can’t be proved in court?“.Do you think Michael would do that?“.I don’t know. I do know that the slickest way in the world to lie is to tell theright amount of truth at the right time-and then shut up. And it wouldn’t be thefirst time that persecution has been courted for its headline value. All right, I’lldismiss it from my mind unless it turns out he can’t handle it. Are you still.Front’?“.If you can refrain from chucking Abby under the chin and saying cootchy-cooand similar uncommercial noises, I’ll fetch her. Otherwise I had better tellDorcas to get up and get to work.“.Bring in Abby. I’m going to make an honest effort to make some commercialnoises-a brand-new plot, known as boy-meets-girl.“.Say, that’s a good one, Boss! I wonder why nobody ever thought of itbefore? Half a sec-. She hurried out.\n 　　Jubal did restrain himself-less than one minute of uncommercial noises anddemonstrations, just enough to invoke Abigail’s heavenly smile, cum dimples,then Anne settled back and let the infant nurse. .Title:“ he began. .’Girls AreLike Boys, Only More So.’ Begin. Henry M. Haversham Fourth had been verycarefully reared, He believed that there were only two kinds of girls: those inhis presence and those who were not. He vastly preferred the latter sort,especially when they stayed that way. Paragraph. He had not beenintroduced to the young lady who fell into his lap, and he did not consider acommon disaster as equivalent to a formal intro-. What the hell do you want?\n 　　Can’t you see I’m working?“.Boss-. said Larry.\n 　　.Get out of that door, close it behind you, and-.\n 　　.Boss! Mike’s church has burned down!“They made a disorderly rout for Larry’s room, Jubal a half length behind Larryat the turn, Anne with eleven pounds up closing rapidly despite her handicap.\n 　　Dorcas trailed the field through being late out the starting gate; the racketwakened her.\n 　　.-midnight last night. What you are now viewing is what was the mainentrance of the cult’s temple, as it appeared immediately after the explosion.\n 　　This is your Neighborly Newsman for New World Networks with yourmidmorning roundup. Stay switched to this pitch for dirt that’s alert, And nowa moment for your local sponsor-. The scene of destruction shimmered outand med-close shot of a lovely young housewife replaced, with dolly-in.\n 　　.Damn, Larry, unplug that contraption and wheel it into the study. Anne-no,Dorcas. Phone Ben.“Anne protested, .You know the Temple never had a telephone-ever. Howcan she?“.Then have somebody chase over and-no, of course not; the Templewouldn’t have anybody-uh, call the chief of police there. No, the districtattorney. The last you heard Mike was still in jail?“.That’s right.“.I hope he still is-and all the others, too.“.So do I. Dorcas, take Abby. I’ll do it.“But as they returned to the study the phone was signalling an incoming calland demanding hush \u0026 scramble. Jubal cursed and set the combo, intendingto blast whoever it was off the frequency.\n 　　But it was Ben Caxton. .Hi, Jubal.“.Ben! What the hell is the situation?“.I see you’ve had some of the news. That’s why I called, to put your mind atrest. Everything is under control. No sweat.“.What about the fire? Anybody hurt?“.No damage at all. Mike says to tell you-.\n 　　.No damage? I just saw a shot of it; it looked like a total-.\n 　　.Oh, that-. Ben shrugged it off. .Look, Jubal, please listen and let me talk. I’vegot other things and other calls after this one. You aren’t the only person whoneeds to be reassured. But Mike said to call you first.“.Uh ... very well, sir. I shall keep silent.“.Nobody hurt, nobody even scorched. Oh, a couple of million dollars inproperty damage, most of it uninsured. Nichevo. The place was alreadychoked with experiences; Mike planned to abandon it soon in any case. Yes,it was fireproof-but anything will burn with enough gasoline and dynamite.“.Incendiary job, huh?“.Please, Jubal. They had arrested eight of us-all they could catch of the NinthCircle, John Doe warrants, mostly. Mike had all of us bailed out in a couple ofhours, except himself. He’s still in the hoosegow-.\n 　　.I’ll be right there!“.Take it easy. Mike says for you to come if you want to, but there isabsolutely no need for it. His words. And I agree. It would just be a pleasuretrip. The fire was set last night while the Temple was empty, everythingcanceled because of the arrests-empty, that is, except for the Nest. All of usin town, except Mike, were gathered in the Innermost Temple, holding aspecial Sharing-Water in his honor, when the explosion and fire were set off.\n 　　So we adjourned to an emergency Nest.“.From the looks of it, you were lucky to get out at all.“.We were completely cut off, Jubal. We’re all dead-.\n 　　.What?“.We’re all listed as dead or missing so far as the authorities know. You see,nobody left the building after that holocaust started - . . by any known exit.“.Uh ... a .priest’s hole’ arrangement?“.Jubal, Mike has very special methods for dealing with such things- and I’mnot going to discuss them over the phone, even scrambled.“.You said he was in jail?“.So I did. He still is.“.But-.\n 　　.That’s enough. If you do come here, don’t go to the Temple. It’s kaput. Ourorganization is busted up. We’re through in this town. You could say thatthey’ve licked us, I suppose. I’m not going to tell you where we are . . - andI’m not calling from there, anyhow. If you must come- and I see no point in it;there’s nothing you can do-just come as you ordinarily would . . . and we’llfind you.“.That’s all. Good-by. Anne, Dorcas, Larry-and you, too, Jubal, and the baby.\n 　　Share water. Thou art God.“ The screen went blank.\n 　　Jubal swore. .I knew it! I knew it all along! That’s what comes of muckingaround with religion. Dorcas, get me a taxi. Anne-no, finish feeding yourchild. Larry, pack me a small bag. Anne, I’ll want most of the iron money andLarry can go into town tomorrow and replenish the supply.“.But, Boss,“ protested Larry, .we’re all going.“.Certainly we are,“ Anne agreed crisply.\n 　　.Pipe down, Anne. And close your mouth, Dorcas. This is not a time whenwomen have the vote. That city is the front line at the moment and anythingcan happen. Larry, you are going to stay here and protect two women and ababy. Forget that about going to the bank; you won’t need cash becausenone of you is to stir off the place until I’m back. Somebody is playing roughand there is enough hook.up between this house and that church that theymight play rough here, too. Larry, flood lights all night long, heat up the fence,don’t hesitate to shoot. And don’t be slow about getting everybody into thevault if necessary-better put Abby’s crib in there at once. Now get with it, allof you-I’ve got to change clothes.“Thirty minutes later Jubal was alone, by choice, in his suite; the rest werebusy at assigned tasks. Larry called up, .Boss! Taxi about to land.“.Be right down,“ he called back, then turned to take a last look at the FallenCaryatid. His eyes were filled with tears. He said softly, .You tried, didn’t you,youngster? But that stone was always too heavy - . . too heavy for anyone.“Gently he touched a hand of the crumpled figure, turned and left.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/255/353.html","bookId":365,"book":{"id":365,"title":"异乡异客 Stranger In A Strange Land","description":"简介： Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A.
