{"id":4617,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 43","content":"It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on the morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price\u0027s; and two days afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account, with the most anxious curiosity:--\\n\\n \"I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day, on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony, and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect. This, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my information. He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and his introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her first lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, but it would be out of place if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information, which could not be delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You should listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were still tired more; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news for you. You have politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin\u0027s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be, in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make _me_ miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times, and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad judge) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined here the other day, there were none to compare with him, and we were a party of sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales, but--but-- but Yours affectionately.\"\\n\\n \"I had almost forgot (it was Edmund\u0027s fault: he gets into my head more than does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself--I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks. Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral of course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service and Henry\u0027s, at an hour\u0027s notice. I should like the scheme, and we would make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and perhaps you would not mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of St. George\u0027s, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one word more. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _you_ approve; but this cannot possibly be permitted before the middle of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till after the 14th, for _we_ have a party that evening. The value of a man like Henry, on such an occasion, is what you can have no conception of; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable. He will see the Rushworths, which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity, and so I think has he--though he will not acknowledge it.\"\\n\\n This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately, to supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. How Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act without or against her meaning; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and many days to come, without producing any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up. She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she would condition, she would require a great deal, but she would finally accept.\\n\\n This was Fanny\u0027s most frequent expectation. A house in town--that, she thought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse. The woman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What an unworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of Mrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny was ashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he _would_ go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of conduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no such inducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own.\\n\\n She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She could not command her attention as she wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that he would write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it gradually wore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more, she was in a most restless, anxious state.\\n\\n At length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be submitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make her useless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and she resumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest in them.\\n\\n Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for information\u0027s sake, she had so strong a desire of not _appearing_ ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most attentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny\u0027s explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay, or every chapter of history. What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author. The early habit of reading was wanting.\\n\\n Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as history or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none returned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park, a description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways of Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and well-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She hoped it was not wrong; though, after a time, Susan\u0027s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle\u0027s house, and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified.\\n\\n Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands, distressed her more and more. Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to, what a blessing it would be! And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford\u0027s regard, the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts. She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.\\n\\n 克劳福德先生想必是第二天上午就动身去伦敦了，因为再也没见他来过普莱斯先生家。两天后，范妮收到了他妹妹的一封来信，证明他确实是第二天走的。范妮一收到这封信，因为急于想了解另外一桩事，便连忙打开了，怀着极大的兴趣，急匆匆地读了起来。\\n\\n 我最亲爱的范妮，我要告诉你，亨利到朴次茅斯看过你了，上星期六他和你一起去海军船坞快活地玩了一趟，第二天又和你一起在大堤上散步。你那可爱的面庞、甜蜜的话语，与清馨的空气、闪烁的大海交映相衬，极其迷人，搞得他心潮激荡，现在回忆起来还欣喜若狂。我所了解的，主要就是这些内容。亨利让我写信，可我不知道别的有什么可写的，只能提一提他这次朴次茅斯之行，他那两次散步，以及他被介绍给你家里的人，特别是介绍给你一位漂亮的妹妹，一位漂亮的十五岁姑娘。你这位妹妹跟你们一起在大堤上散步，我想你们给她上了爱情的第一课。我没有时间多写，不过即使有时间，也不宜多写，因为这只是一封谈正事的信，旨在传达一些必得传达、耽搁不得的消息。我亲爱的、亲爱的范妮，如果你在我跟前，我有多少话要对你说啊！我有让你听不完的话，你更会有给我出不完的主意。我有千言万语想讲给你听，可惜信里连百分之一也写不下，因此就索性作罢，由你随便去猜吧。我没有什么新闻告诉你。政治上的新闻你当然了解得到，我要是把我连日参加的舞会和应酬的人们一一向你罗列，那只会惹你厌烦。我本该向你描绘一下你大表姐第一次举办舞会的情景，可我当时懒得动笔，现在已成了陈谷子烂芝麻。可以一言以蔽之：一切都办得很得体，亲朋们都很满意，她的穿戴和风度使她极为风光。我的朋友弗雷泽太太真高兴能住上这样的房子，我要是能住这样的房子也会称心的。复活节过后，我去看过斯托诺韦夫人。她看上去情绪很好，也很快活。我想斯托诺韦勋爵在家里一定脾气很好，非常和蔼，现在我觉得他不像以前那么难看了，你至少会看到许多更难看的人。他跟你表哥埃德蒙比起来可就逊色多了。对于我刚提到的这位出众的人物，我该说些什么呢？如果我完全不提他的名字，你看了会起疑心。那么，我就说吧。我们见过他两三次，我这里的朋友们都对他印象很深，觉得他风度翩翩，一表人才。弗雷泽太太是个有眼力的人，她说像他这样的长相、高矮和风度的入，她在伦敦只看见过三个。我必须承认，几天前他在我们这里吃饭的时候，席间没有一个人能和他相比，而在座的有十六个人之多。幸运的是，如今服装上没有差别，看不出什么名堂。但是——但是——但是…\\n\\n 你亲爱的\\n\\n 我差一点忘记（这都怪埃德蒙，他搅得我心猿意马），我得替亨利和我本人讲一件非常重要的事，我是指我们要把你接回北安普敦。我亲爱的小宝贝，别再待在朴次茅斯了，免得失去你的关貌。恶劣的海风能毁掉美貌和健康。我那可怜的婶母只要离海在十英里以内，总是觉得不舒服。海军将军当然不信，可我知道就是那么回事。我听你和亨利的吩咐，接到通知一个小时后便可动身。我赞成这个计划，我们可以稍微绕个弯，顺路带你去看看埃弗灵厄姆。也许你不会反对我们穿过伦敦，到汉诺威广场的圣乔治教堂里面瞧瞧。只是在这期间不要让我见到你埃德蒙表哥，我不想让他搅乱我的心。信写得太长啦！再说一句吧。我发觉亨利想再去一趟诺福克，办一桩你赞成的事情。不过，这事在下周中之前还办不成，也就是说，他在十四号之前无论如何走不了，因为十四号晚上我们要举办舞会。像亨利这样一个男人在这种场合能有多么重要，你是想象不到的，那就让我告诉你吧，那是无法估量的。他要见见拉什沃思夫妇。我倒不反对他见见他们。他有点好奇——我认为他是有点好奇，尽管他自己不会承认。\\n\\n 这封信她迫不及待地匆匆看了一遍，又从容不迫地细读了一遍，信里的内容颇费思索，读后使她对每件事更是无法捉摸。从信中看来，唯一可以肯定的是，事情尚未定局。埃德蒙还没有开口。克劳福德小姐心里究竟是怎么想的，她想要怎么办，她会不会放弃她的意图，或者违背她的意图，埃德蒙对她是否还像分别前那么重要，如果不像以前那么重要，那么是会越来越不重要呢，还是会重新变得重要起来，这些问题让她猜来猜去，考虑了多少天也没得出个结论。她脑子里揣摩得最多的一个念头，是克劳福德小姐恢复了伦敦的生活习惯之后，原来的热情可能冷下来，决心可能有所动摇，但她最终可能因为太喜欢埃德蒙，而不会放弃他。她可能抑制自己的情感，去更多地考虑世俗的利益。她可能会犹豫，可能会戏弄他，可能会规定一些条件，可能会提出很多要求，但她最终会接受他的求婚。这是范妮心头最常出现的揣测。在伦敦给她弄一幢房子！她觉得这绝对是不可能的。不过，很难说克劳福德小姐会有什么不敢要的。看来她表哥的处境越来越糟。这个女人这么议论他，而且只议论他长相如何！这算什么爱呀！还要从弗雷泽太太对他的夸奖中汲取动力！而她自己还和他亲密无间地相处了半年呢！范妮替她害臊。信中有关克劳福德先生和她本人的那部分，相对来说对她触动不大。克劳福德先生是十四号前还是十四号后去诺福克与她毫不相干，不过，从各方面看来，她觉得他会很快就去的。克劳福德小姐居然想让他和拉什沃思太太相见，真是恶劣至极，纯属胡闹，存心不良。她希望他可不要受这堕落的愿望所驱使。他曾说过他对拉什沃思太太丝毫无意，做妹妹的应该承认，他的感情比她来得健康。\\n\\n 范妮收到这封信后，更加急切地盼望伦敦再来信。一连几天，她一门心思在盼信，什么来过的信，可能来的信，搅得她心神不宁，连她平时和苏珊一起的读书和聊天都中断了。她想控制自己的注意力，但却控制不住。如果克劳福德先生把她的话转告了她表哥，表哥无论如何都会给她写信的，她觉得这很有可能，极有可能。他平时一贯待她挺好，因此不会不给她来信的。她一直心神不宁，坐立不安，三四天仍未见到来信，她才渐渐断了这个念头。\\n\\n 最后，她终于平静了一点。这件事只能撂在脑后，不能为它过分劳神，什么也不干。时间起了点作用，她的自我克制也起了些作用，她又关心起苏珊来，而且像以前一样认真。\\n\\n 苏珊已经非常喜欢她了。她虽然不像范妮小时候那样酷爱读书，生性也不像范妮那样坐得住，也不像范妮那样渴求知识，但她又极不愿意在别人眼里显得自己一无所知。在这种情况下，再加上头脑机灵，她就成了一个非常用心、长进很快、知道感恩的学生。范妮成了她心目中的圣人。范妮的讲解和评论成了每篇文章和每章历史极为重要的补充。范妮讲起过去，比哥尔德斯密斯①（译注：①哥尔德斯密斯（Oliver Goldsmith．1730-1774），英国诗人、剧作家、小说家。）书里写的让她记得更牢。她赞赏姐姐的解释比哪个作家来得都好。她的不足之处是小时候没有养成读书的习惯。\\n\\n 不过，她们的谈话并非总是局限于历史、道德这样高雅的话题，其他问题她们也谈。在那些次要的问题中，她们最常谈的、谈得时间最久的，还是曼斯菲尔德庄园，那里的人，那里的规矩，那里的娱乐，那里的习俗。苏珊生来就羡慕温文尔雅、礼貌周全的人们，因此便如饥似渴地听着，范妮也就津津乐道起来。她觉得她这样做并没有错。可是过了一会，苏珊对姨父家的一切都艳羡不已，真巴不得自己能去一趟北安普敦郡。这似乎是在责怪范妮，她不该在妹妹心里激起这种无法满足的愿望。\\n\\n 可怜的苏珊几乎和姐姐一样不适应自己的家了。范妮完全能理解这一点。她开始在想，当她脱离朴次茅斯的时候，自己也不会十分愉快，因为她要把苏珊撂在这里。这样可以塑造的一个好姑娘，却要丢在这样的环境里，她心里越想越不是滋味。她要是有一个家，能把妹妹接去，那该有多好啊！她要是能回报克劳福德先生对她的爱，他决不会反对她把妹妹接去，那会给她自己增加多大的幸福。她觉得他的脾气的确很好，会非常乐意支持她这样做。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/316/3067.html","bookId":161,"book":{"id":161,"title":"曼斯菲尔德庄园 Mansfield Park","description":"简介： Mansfield Park is a novel by Jane Austen, written at Chawton Cottage between 1812 and 1814.
