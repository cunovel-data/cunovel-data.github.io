{"id":4605,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were together in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered. She was almost at the door, and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for, and a \"Let Sir Thomas know\" to the servant.\n Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some letters, said, with a most animated look, \"I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother is a lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother\u0027s promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.\"\n Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak. To see the expression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress of her feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She took the letters as he gave them. The first was from the Admiral to inform his nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral had set to work in the business, the other from that friend to himself, by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price\u0027s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.\n While her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from one to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event--\n \"I will not talk of my own happiness,\" said he, \"great as it is, for I think only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment\u0027s delay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your brother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together.\"\n \"Has this been all _your_ doing, then?\" cried Fanny. \"Good heaven! how very, very kind! Have you really-- was it by _your_ desire? I beg your pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I am stupefied.\"\n Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an earlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that of introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on. This had been his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but this had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_ _wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying only when he paused, \"How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!\" She jumped up and moved in haste towards the door, crying out, \"I will go to my uncle. My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible.\" But this could not be suffered. The opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too impatient. He was after her immediately. \"She must not go, she must allow him five minutes longer,\" and he took her hand and led her back to her seat, and was in the middle of his farther explanation, before she had suspected for what she was detained. When she did understand it, however, and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before, and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments unable to speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling and gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and in such a way as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt, because he had been conferring an obligation, which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her. While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William\u0027s behalf, she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she got up, and said only, with much agitation, \"Don\u0027t, Mr. Crawford, pray don\u0027t! I beg you would not. This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me. I must go away. I cannot bear it.\" But he was still talking on, describing his affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself, hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance. It was so; he had said it. Her astonishment and confusion increased; and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious, she could hardly stand. He pressed for an answer.\n \"No, no, no!\" she cried, hiding her face. \"This is all nonsense. Do not distress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot bear, I must not listen to such--No, no, don\u0027t think of me. But you are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.\"\n She had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in. It was no time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured mind, to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a cruel necessity. She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching, and was walking up and down the East room ill the utmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas\u0027s politeness or apologies were over, or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate.\n She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy, miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond belief! He was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his habits that he could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He had previously made her the happiest of human beings, and now he had insulted--she knew not what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She would not have him be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers, if they meant but to trifle?\n But William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and without an alloy. She would think of it for ever and forget all the rest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William!\n She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford\u0027s having left the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William\u0027s destination. Sir Thomas was as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and communicative; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he might think nothing of what had passed, it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon.\n She tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour approached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room. She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of hearing of William\u0027s promotion.\n Mr. Crawford was not only in the room--he was soon close to her. He had a note to deliver from his sister. Fanny could not look at him, but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice. She opened her note immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read it, to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to dine there, screened her a little from view.\n \"My dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you, to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for at least the last six weeks-- I cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can be no difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier than he goes.--Yours affectionately, M. C.\"\n These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford\u0027s meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother\u0027s attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious. She did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness in the idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation every way. She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and he spoke to her much too often; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others. Her comfort in that day\u0027s dinner was quite destroyed: she could hardly eat anything; and when Sir Thomas good-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite, she was ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford\u0027s interpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_ were immediately directed towards her.\n She was more silent than ever. She would hardly join even when William was the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too, and there was pain in the connexion.\n She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in despair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the drawing-room, and she was able to think as she would, while her aunts finished the subject of William\u0027s appointment in their own style.\n Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it. \"_Now_ William would be able to keep himself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some difference in _her_ presents too. She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in her power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give him something rather considerable; that is, for _her_, with _her_ limited means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin. She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many things to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it.\"\n \"I am glad you gave him something considerable,\" said Lady Bertram, with most unsuspicious calmness, \"for _I_ gave him only 10.\"\n \"Indeed!\" cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. \"Upon my word, he must have gone off with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey to London either!\"\n \"Sir Thomas told me 10 would be enough.\"\n Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency, began to take the matter in another point.\n \"It is amazing,\" said she, \"how much young people cost their friends, what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are my sister Price\u0027s children; take them all together, I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing of what _I_ do for them.\"\n \"Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help it; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny, William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I will have two shawls, Fanny.\"\n Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. There was everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his words and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it; all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits. How could _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely her superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even where pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, so carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him? And farther, how could it be supposed that his sister, with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts. Everything might be possible rather than serious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her. She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among the common meaning; in any other man, at least, she would have said that it meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women.\n She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest. She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and she carefully refused him every opportunity.\n At last--it seemed an at last to Fanny\u0027s nervousness, though not remarkably late--he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying, \"Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it be only a line.\"\n \"Oh yes! certainly,\" cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away-- \"I will write directly.\"\n She went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of writing for her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what in the world to say. She had read Miss Crawford\u0027s note only once, and how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing. Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance: but something must be instantly written; and with only one decided feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--\n \"I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind congratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest of your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behave differently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour of your note, I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc.\"\n The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for she found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was coming towards her.\n \"You cannot think I mean to hurry you,\" said he, in an undervoice, perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note, \"you cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.\"\n \"Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a moment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give _that_ to Miss Crawford.\"\n The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest.\n Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William\u0027s advancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, that the language would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no arrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford\u0027s attentions.\n 第二天上午，亨利·克劳福德又来到了曼斯菲尔德庄园，而且到的比平常访亲拜友的时间要早。两位女士都在早餐厅里。幸运的是，他进来的时候，伯特伦夫人正要出去。她差不多走到门口了，也不想白走这么远再折回去，于是便客气地打了个招呼，说了声有人等她，吩咐仆人“禀报托马斯爵士”，然后继续往外走。\n 亨利见她要走喜不自禁，躬身行了个礼，目送她走去，然后便抓紧时机，立即转身走到范妮跟前，掏出了几封信，眉飞色舞地说：“我必须承认，无论谁给我个机会让我与你单独相见，我都感激不尽：你想不到我是怎样在盼望这样一个机会。我了解你做妹妹的心情，不希望这一家的任何人与你同时得到我现在给你带来的消息。他晋升了。你哥哥当上少尉了。我怀着无比高兴的心情，向你祝贺你哥哥晋升。这是这些信上说的，都是刚刚收到的。你也许想看看吧。”\n 范妮说不出话来，不过他也不需要她说话。看看她的眼神，脸色的变化，心情的演变，由怀疑，到慌张，到欣喜，也就足够了。范妮把信接了过去。第一封是海军将军写给侄子的，只有寥寥数语，告诉侄子说，他把提升小普莱斯的事办成了。里边还附了两封信，一封是海军大臣的秘书写给将军委托的朋友的，另一封是那位朋友写给将军本人的。从信里可以看出，海军大臣非常高兴地批阅了查尔斯爵士的推荐信，查尔斯爵士很高兴有这么个机会向克劳福德将军表示自己的敬意，威廉·普莱斯先生被任命为英国皇家轻巡洋舰“画眉”号的少尉这一消息传出后，不少要人都为之高兴。\n 范妮的手在信纸下边颤抖，眼睛从这封信看到那封，心里激动不已。克劳福德情急心切地继续表白他在这件事情上所起的作用。\n “我不想谈我自己如何高兴，”他说，“尽管我欣喜万分。我只想到你的幸福。与你相比，谁还配得上幸福呢？这件事本该是让你最先知道的，我并不愿意比你先知道。不过，我是一刻也没耽搁呀。今天早上邮件来迟了，但我收到后一分钟也没耽搁。我在这件事上如何焦急，如何不安，如何发狂，我不打算描述。在伦敦期间还没有办成，我真是羞愧难当，失望至极啊！我一天又一天地待在那里，就是盼望办成这件事，如果不是为了这样一件对我来说至关重要的事情，我决不会离开曼斯菲尔德这么长时间。但是，尽管我叔父满腔热情地答应了我的要求，立即着手操办起来，可是依然有些困难，一个朋友不在家，另一个朋友有事脱不了身，我想等最后也等不下去了，心想事情已经托给可靠的入，便于星期一动身回来了，相信要不了几天就会收到这样的信。我叔叔是世上最好的人，他可是尽心尽力了，我就知道，他见到你哥哥之后是会尽力帮忙的。他喜欢你哥哥。昨天我没有告诉你将军是多么喜欢他，也没有怎么透露将军怎样夸奖他。我要拖一拖再说，等到他的夸奖被证明是来自朋友的夸奖。今天算是得到了证明。现在我可以告诉你，连我都没有料到，他们那天晚上相会之后，我叔父会对威廉·普莱斯那么感兴趣，对他的事情那么热心，又对他那样称赞。这一切完全是我叔父自愿表示出来的。”\n “那么，这一切都是你努力的结果吧？”范妮嚷道。“天哪！太好了，真是太好啦！你真的——真的是你提出来的吧？请原谅，我给搞糊涂了。是克劳福德将军要求的吗？是怎么办成的？我给搞糊涂了。”\n 亨利兴致勃勃地做了说明，从早一些时候讲起，着重解释了他起的作用。他这次去伦敦没有别的事情，只想把她哥哥引荐到希尔街，劝说将军尽量运用他的关系帮他晋升。这就是他的使命。他对谁都没说起过，甚至对玛丽都只字未提。他当时还不能肯定结果如何，因而不想让别人知道他的心思。不过，这就是他的使命。他大为感慨地讲起他如何关心这件事，用了那么热烈的字眼，尽是什么“最深切的关心”，“双重的动机”，“不便说出的目的和愿望”，范妮要是注意听的话，是不会总也听不出他的意思的。然而，她由于惊喜交集、无暇他顾，就连他讲到威廉的时候，她都听不完全，等他停下来时，她只是说：“多好的心啊！多么好的心啊！噢！克劳福德先生，我们对你感激不尽。最亲爱的，最亲爱的威廉啊！”她霍地站起来，匆匆向门口走去，一边嚷道：“我要去见姨父。应该尽快让姨父知道。”但是，这可不成。这是个千载难逢的良机，亨利心里已经迫不及待了。他立即追了上去。“你不能走，你得再给我五分钟。”说着抓住了她的手，把她领回到座位上，又向她解释了一番．她还没有明白为什么不让她走。然而，等她明白过来，发现对方说什么她已引起了他从来不曾有过的感情，他为威廉所做的一切都是出于对她的无限的、无可比拟的爱，她感到万分痛苦，很久说不出活来。她认为这一切实在荒谬，只不过是骗人的逢场作戏、献殷勤。她感到这是用不正当、不体面的手法对待她，她不应该受到这样的对待。不过，这正符合他的为人，与她所见到的他以往的行径如出一辙。可她还是抑制住自己，尽量不把心里的不快流露出来，因为他毕竟有恩于她，不管他怎样粗俗放浪，她都不能轻慢小看这番恩情。这时，她一颗心还在扑扑直跳，光顾得为威廉高兴，为威廉感到庆幸，而对于仅仅伤害自己的事情，却不会怨恨不已。她两次把手缩回来，两次想摆脱他而没摆脱掉，便站了起来，非常激动地说：“不要这样，克劳福德先生，请你不要这样。我求你不要这样。我不喜欢这样的谈话。我得走了。我受不了。”可是对方还在说，倾诉他的钟情，求她给以回报，最后，话已说得十分露骨，连范妮也听出了个中意思：他把他的人，他的一生，他的财产，他的一切都献给她，要她接受。就是这个意思，他已经说出来了。范妮愈来愈感到惊讶，愈来愈心慌意乱。虽然还拿不准他的话是真是假，她几乎站不住了。对方催她答复。\n “不，不，不，”范妮捂着脸叫道。“这完全是无稽之谈。不要惹我苦恼了。我不要再听这样的话了。你对威廉的好处使我说不出对你有多感激。但是，我不需要，受不了，也不想听你这些话——不，不，不要动我的心思。不过，你也不在动我的心思。我知道这是没有的事儿。”\n 她已经挣脱了他。这当儿，托马斯爵士正在向他们这间屋子走来，只听他在跟一个仆人说话。这就来不及再诉爱求情了，不过亨利过于乐观自信，觉得她只不过是由于故作娇羞，才没有让他立即得到他所追求的幸福，在这个节骨眼上跟她分手，未免有些太残酷了。她姨父朝这个门走来，她以对面那个门冲出去。托马斯爵士与客人还没寒暄完，或者说客人刚刚开始向他报告他带来的喜讯，她已经在东屋里走来走去了，心里极其矛盾，也极其混乱。\n 她在思索、在捉摸每一桩事，也为每一桩事担忧。她激动，快活，苦闷，感激不尽，恼火至极。这一切简直令人难以置信！克劳福德不可原谅，也不可理解！不过，这是他的一贯行径，做什么事都掺杂点邪念。他先使她成为世上最快活的人，后来又侮辱了她——她不知道怎样说为好——不知道怎样分析、怎样看待这件事。她想把他看做耍儿戏，但若真是耍儿戏，为什么要说这样一些话，做出这样的许愿呢？\n 不过，威廉当上了少尉。这可是毋庸置疑、毫不掺假的事实。她愿永远牢记这一点，忘掉其余的一切。克劳福德先生肯定再也不会向她求爱了，他肯定看出对方是多么不欢迎他这样做。若是如此，就凭他对威廉的帮助，她该如何感激他呀！\n 在没有肯定克劳福德先生已经离开这座房子之前，她的活动范围从不超过从东屋到中间楼梯口。可等她确信他走了之后，她便急忙下楼去找姨父，跟他分享彼此的喜悦之情，听他讲解或猜测威廉现在会去什么地方。托马斯爵士正如她期望的那样不胜高兴，他还非常慈爱，话也很多。她和他谈起了威廉，谈得非常投机，使她忘记了先前令她烦恼的事情。可是，等谈话快结束的时候，她发现克劳福德先生已约定当天还要回到这里吃饭。这可是个令她极其扫兴的消息。虽然他可能不会把已经过去的事放在心上，但是这么快又见到他使她感到十分别扭。\n 她试图让自己平静下来。快到吃晚饭的时候，她尽量使自己心里感觉像平常一样，外表看上去也像平常一样。但是，等客人进屋的时候，她又情不由己地显得极为羞怯，极不自在。她万万没有想到，在听到威廉晋升的第一天，居然会有什么事情搅得她如此痛苦。\n 克劳福德先生不只是进到屋里，而且很快来到了她跟前。他把她妹妹的一封信转交给她。范妮不敢看他，但从他的声音中听不出为上次说的蠢话感到羞愧。她立即把信拆开，很高兴能有点事情做做。还使她感到高兴的是，诺里斯姨妈也来吃饭，她不停地动来动去，范妮读信时觉得受到了一点遮掩。\n 亲爱的范妮：从现在起我可能要永远这样称呼你，以使我的舌头得到彻底的解放，不要再像过去那样，笨拙地叫了你至少六个星期的普莱斯小姐——我要写上几句话叫我哥哥带给你，向你表示热烈的祝贺，并且万分高兴地表示我的赞成和支持。勇往直前吧，亲爱的范妮，不要畏惧。没有什么了不起的障碍。我自信我表示赞成会起一定作用。因此，今天下午你就拿出你最甜蜜的微笑对他笑脸相迎吧，让他回来的时候比去时更加幸福。\n 你亲爱的\n 玛·克\n 这些话对范妮没有丝毫的帮助。她匆匆地读着信，心里乱糟糟的，猜不透克劳福德小姐信里的意思，但是看得出来，她是在祝贺她赢得了她哥哥的钟情，甚至看来好像信以为真似的。她不知所措，莫衷一是。一想到这是真的，便为之愁苦不堪，怎么都想不通，心里只觉得忐忑不安。克劳福德先生每次跟她说话，她都感到烦恼，而他又偏偏爱跟她说话。她觉得他跟她说话的时候，从口气到态度都有点特别，与他跟别人说话的时候大不相同。她这天吃饭的胃口给破坏殆尽，几乎什么都吃不下去。托马斯爵士开玩笑说，她是高兴得吃不下饭，她羞得快挺不住了，生怕克劳福德先生对她姨父的话有别的领会。他就坐在她的右手，虽然她一眼也不想看他，但她觉得他的眼睛却一直在盯着她。\n 她比什么时候都沉默寡言，就连谈到威廉的时候，也很少开口，因为他的晋升完全是坐在她右手的这个人周旋的结果，一联想到这一点，她就感到凄楚难言。\n 她觉得伯特伦夫人比哪次坐席都久，担心这次宴席永远散不了。不过，大家终于来到了客厅，两位姨妈以自己的方式谈起威廉的任命，这时范妮才有机会去想自己愿意想的事情。\n 诺里斯太太所以对这件事感到高兴，主要是因为这给托马斯爵士省了钱。“现在威廉可以自己养活自己了，这对他二姨父来说可就非同小可了，因为谁也说不准他二姨父为他破费了多少。说实在的，今后我也可以少送东西了。我很高兴，这次威廉走的时候给他送了点东西。我的确感到很高兴，当时在手头不太拮据的情况下，还能给他送了点像样的东西。对我来说是很像样，因为我家财力有限，现在要是用来布置他的房舱，那东西可就有了用场了。我知道他要花些钱，要买不少东西，虽然他父母会帮他把样样东西都买得很便宜，但我很高兴我也尽了点心。”\n “我很高兴你给了他点像样的东西，”伯特伦夫人对她的话深信不疑，平平静静地说道。“我只给了他十英镑。”\n “真的呀！”诺里斯太太脸红起来，嚷道。“我敢说，他走的时候口袋里肯定装满了钱！再说，去伦敦的路上也不要他花钱呀！”\n “托马斯爵士对我说给他十英镑就够了。”\n 诺里斯太太无意探究十英镑够还是不够，却从另一个角度看待这个问题。\n “真令人吃惊，”她说，“看看这些年轻人，从把他们抚养成人，到帮他们进入社会，朋友们要为他们花多少钱啊！他们很少去想这些钱加起来会有多少，也很少去想他们的父母、姨父姨妈一年要为他们花多少钱。就拿我普莱斯妹妹家的孩子来说吧，把他们加到一起，我敢说谁也不敢相信每年要花托马斯爵士多少钱，还不算我给他们的补贴。”\n “你说得一点不错，姐姐。不过，孩子们真可怜呀！他们也是没办法。再说你也知道，这对托马斯爵士来说，也算不了什么。范妮，威廉要是到东印度群岛去的话，叫他别忘了给我带一条披巾。还有什么别的好东西，我也托他给我买。我希望他去东印度群岛，这样我就会有披巾了。我想要两条披巾，范妮。”\n 这当儿，范妮只有迫不得已时才说话。她一心急于弄明白克劳福德兄妹俩打的什么主意。除了那哥哥的话和态度之外，无论从哪方面来看，他们都不会是真心实意的。考虑到他们的习性和思想方法，以及她本人的不利条件，从哪方面来看，这件事都是不合常情的，说不过去，也不大可能。他见过多少女人，受过多少女人的爱慕，跟多少女人调过情，而这些女人都比她强得多。人家费尽心机地想取悦他，都没法打动他。他把这种事情看得这么淡，总是满不在乎，无动于衷。别人都觉得他了不起，他却似乎瞧不起任何人。她怎么会激起这样一个人真心爱她呢？而且，他妹妹在婚姻问题上讲究门第，看重利益，怎么能设想她会认真促成这样一件事呢？他们两个表现得太反常了。范妮越想越感到羞愧。什么事情都有可能，唯独他不可能真心爱她，他妹妹也不可能真心赞成他爱她。托马斯爵士和克劳福德先生没来客厅之前，她对此已经深信不疑了。克劳福德先生进来之后，她又难以对此坚信不移了，因为他有一两次投向她的目光，她无法将之归结为一般的意思。至少，若是别人这样看她，她会说那蕴涵着一种十分恳切、十分明显的情意。但她仍然尽力把这看做他对她的两位表姐和众多别的女人经常施展的手段。\n 她感到他就想背着别人跟她说话。她觉得，整个晚上每逢托马斯爵士出去的时候，或者每逢托马斯爵士跟诺里斯太太谈得起劲的时候，他就在寻找这样的机会，不过她总是谨慎地躲着他，不给他任何机会。\n 最后——似乎范妮的忐忑不安终于结束了，不过结束得不算太晚——他提出要走了。范妮一听这话如释重负，然而霎时间他又转过脸来，对她说道：“你没有什么东西捎给玛丽吗？不给她封回信吗？她要是什么都收不到的话，是会失望的。给她写个回信吧，哪怕只写一行也好。”\n “噢！是的，当然，”范妮嚷道，一边匆忙站起来，急于摆脱这种窘迫，急于赶紧走开。“我这就去写。”\n 于是她走到她常替姨妈写信的桌边，提笔准备写信，可又压根儿不知道写什么是好！克劳福德小姐的信她只看过一遍，本来就没看明白，要答复实在令人伤脑筋。她从没写过这种信，如果还来得及对信的格调产生疑虑的话，那她真会疑虑重重。但是必须马上写出点东西来。她心里只有一个明确的念头，那就是希望对方读后不会觉得她真的有意。她动笔写了起来，身心都在激烈地颤抖：\n 亲爱的克劳福德小姐，非常感谢你对最亲爱的威廉的事表示衷心的祝贺。信的其余内容，在我看来毫无意义。对于这种事情，我深感不配，希望今后不要再提。我和克劳福德先生相识已久，深知他的为人。他若对我同样了解的话，想必不会有此举动。临笔惶然，不知所云，倘能不再提及此事，定会不胜感激。承蒙来信，谨致谢忱。\n 亲爱的克劳福德小姐，永远是你的……\n 结尾到底写了些什么，她在慌乱中也搞不清楚了，因为她发现，克劳福德先生借口取信向她走来。\n “不要以为我是来催你的，”他看她惊慌失措地将信折叠装封，压低了声音说。“不要以为我有这个意思。我恳求你不要着急。”\n “噢！谢谢你，我已经写完了，刚刚写完～—马上就好了——我将非常感激你——如果你能把这封信转交给克劳福德小姐。”\n 信递过来了，只好接下。范妮立即别过脸朝众人围坐的炉边走去，克劳福德先生无事可做，只好一本正经地走掉了。\n 范妮觉得她从来没有这样激动过，既为痛苦而激动，又为快乐而激动。不过，所幸的是，这种快乐不会随着这一天过去而消逝——因为她天天都不会忘怀威廉的晋升，而那痛苦，她希望会一去不复返。她毫不怀疑，她的信肯定写得糟糕透顶，语句还不如一个孩子组织得好，谁叫她心烦意乱的，根本无法斟酌推敲。不过，这封信会让他们两人都明白，克劳福德先生的百般殷勤既骗不了她，也不会让她为之得意。\n \n
