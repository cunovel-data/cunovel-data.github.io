{"id":4604,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"Miss Crawford\u0027s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke-- suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the next day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but he was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, \"My dear Henry, where can you have been all this time?\" he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny.\\n\\n \"Sitting with them an hour and a half!\" exclaimed Mary.\\n\\n But this was only the beginning of her surprise.\\n\\n \"Yes, Mary,\" said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was: \"I could not get away sooner; Fanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely made up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price.\"\\n\\n The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister\u0027s imagination; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his determination once admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the surprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother\u0027s marrying a little beneath him.\\n\\n \"Yes, Mary,\" was Henry\u0027s concluding assurance. \"I am fairly caught. You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky, lucky girl!\" cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; \"what a match for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight of all the family, indeed! And she has some _true_ friends in it! How _they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When did you begin to think seriously about her?\"\\n\\n Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. \"How the pleasing plague had stolen on him\" he could not say; and before he had expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over, his sister eagerly interrupted him with, \"Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind.\"\\n\\n But this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.\\n\\n \"When Fanny is known to him,\" continued Henry, \"he will doat on her. She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral, for she he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely settled-- settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my business yet.\"\\n\\n \"Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That Mansfield should have done so much for--that _you_ should have found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not want for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her own happiness?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"What are you waiting for?\"\\n\\n \"For--for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing-- supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)--you would be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would marry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.\"\\n\\n As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny\u0027s charms. Fanny\u0027s beauty of face and figure, Fanny\u0027s graces of manner and goodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman\u0027s worth in the judgment of man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never believe it absent. Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family, excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently strong. To see her with her brother! What could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then, her understanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind. Nor was this all. Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity, he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious.\\n\\n \"I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,\" said he; \"and _that_ is what I want.\"\\n\\n Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.\\n\\n \"The more I think of it,\" she cried, \"the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.\"\\n\\n \"It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years\u0027 lease of Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I could name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.\"\\n\\n \"Ha!\" cried Mary; \"settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we shall be all together.\"\\n\\n When she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in her.\\n\\n \"You must give us more than half your time,\" said he. \"I cannot admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!\"\\n\\n Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister many months longer.\\n\\n \"You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer with the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_ are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would have broken my heart.\"\\n\\n \"Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must not prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one another.\"\\n\\n Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant: time would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflection on the Admiral. \"Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_ would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman.\"\\n\\n The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer.\\n\\n \"Had you seen her this morning, Mary,\" he continued, \"attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt\u0027s stupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman\u0027s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to _me_, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said. Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing.\"\\n\\n \"My dearest Henry,\" cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face, \"how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?\"\\n\\n \"I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense. I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be angry,\" he added, after a moment\u0027s silence, and in a cooler tone; \"Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments\u0027 ill flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women\u0027s, though _I_ was the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due. Now she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.\"\\n\\n \"Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or forgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.\"\\n\\n \"Edmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior, long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what do they _do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in the world, to what I _shall_ do?\"\\n\\n 这次谈话大大减轻了克劳福德小姐心头的不安，她又高高兴兴地往家里走去，即便再下一个星期的阴雨，即便仍然只有这么寥寥无几的人为伴，她都会经受得了。不过，就在当天晚上，她哥哥又从伦敦回来了，像平时一样兴高采烈，甚至比平时还要高兴，因此她也就无须再经受进一步的考验了。哥哥仍然不肯把他此行的目的告诉她，这倒让她越发高兴。若是在一天以前，这只会使她生气，可现在却成了有趣的玩笑——她猜想，所以不告诉她，一定是有什么事瞒着她，想给她来个惊喜。第二天还真出了一件出乎她意料的事。亨利原说去向伯特伦一家人问个好，十分钟后就回来——可他去了一个多小时。他妹妹一直在等他陪她在花园里散步，最后等得实在不耐烦，终于在拐弯处遇到了他，便大声嚷道：“亲爱的亨利，你这大半天跑到哪儿去了？”做哥哥的只好说，他是在陪伯特伦夫人和范妮。\\n\\n “陪她们坐了一个半钟头啊！”玛丽嚷道。\\n\\n 不过，这还仅仅是她惊奇的开始。\\n\\n “是的，玛丽。”亨利挽住了她的胳膊，顺着拐弯处走着，好像不知身在何处。“我没法早走——范妮那模样有多美呀！我已经打定了主意，玛丽。我已经下定了决心。你会吃惊吗？不会的——你应该意识到，我是打定主意要和范妮·普莱斯结婚的。”\\n\\n 这时，做妹妹的已经惊奇到了极点。玛丽虽说了解一点哥哥的心思，但做梦也没想到他会有这样的打算。亨利见妹妹大为惊诧，不得不把刚才讲过的话又讲了一遍，而且一本正经地讲得更加充分。做妹妹的明白了哥哥真的做出了这样的决定后，觉得他这个决定也并非不足取。她在惊奇的同时甚至感到高兴。她为他们家与伯特伦家结成亲戚而满心欢喜，哥哥的这桩婚事虽说有点低就，她也并不在意了。\\n\\n “是的，玛丽，”亨利最后说道，“我完全坠人了情网。你知道，我一开始打的是些无聊的主意——但最后却是这样的结局。我自以为已经使她对我颇有好感，但我对她的感情却是坚定不移的。”\\n\\n “好幸运，好幸运的姑娘啊！”玛丽心情一平静便嚷道。“这对她是多好的一门亲事呀！我最亲爱的亨利，这是我的第一个感觉。可我的第二个感觉是，我要同样真诚地告诉你，我由衷地赞成你的选择，预见你会像我衷心希望的那样幸福。你将有一个娇小可爱的妻子，对你感激不尽，忠心耿耿。你也完全配有这样一个人。这门亲事对她来说是多么意外啊！诺里斯太太常说她运气好，她现在又会怎么说呀？这真是他们全家人的喜事啊！在这一家人中，她倒有几个真正的朋友。他们该多么高兴啊！你给我从头到尾地讲一讲，滔滔不绝地讲下去。你是什么时候开始认真考虑她的？”\\n\\n 这种问题虽说最乐意让别人问，但是却又最难以回答。他说不出来“那令人陶醉的烦恼如何偷偷袭上我的心头”①（译注：①引自英国剧作家和桂冠诗人威廉·怀特海德( 1715 -1785)的诗句。）。他用略加改变的措辞反复表达这个意思，没等重复完第三遍，他妹妹便迫不及待地打断了他，说道：“啊！亲爱的亨利，你就是为这去伦敦的呀！这就是你去办的事呀！你是去找海军将军商量，然后再拿定主意的。”\\n\\n 亨利对此矢口否认。他很了解叔父，不会拿婚姻问题去征求他的意见。海军将军讨厌结婚，一个有独立财产的年轻人要结婚，他认为永远不能原谅。\\n\\n “他要是认识了范妮，”亨利继续说，“一定会非常喜欢她。她正是一个可以打消海军将军这种人的种种成见的女子，因为她正是他认为世上不会有的那种女子。她是他所描绘的不可能存在的女人——如果他真有美妙的措辞来表达自己的思想的话。不过，没到事情彻底定下来之前——没到木已成舟，无法干涉之前，他是得不到一点风声的。玛丽，你刚才完全猜错了。你还没有猜出我去伦敦办什么事呢！”\\n\\n “好了，好了，我明白了。现在我知道事情与谁有关了，其余的我也不急于想知道。范妮·普莱斯——妙啊——妙极啦！曼斯菲尔德居然为你起了这么大的作用——你居然在曼斯菲尔德找到了你命运的寄托！不过，你做得很对，你的选择再好不过了。世上没有比她更好的姑娘，何况你又不需要财产。至于她的亲戚们，他们都是些上好的人。伯特伦家无疑是这个国家的上等人家。她是托马斯爵士的外甥女，仅凭这一点，就会让世人另眼相待。不过，说下去，说下去。再给我多讲一讲。你是怎么计划的？她知不知道自已大喜临门了？”\\n\\n “不知道。”\\n\\n “你还在等什么？”\\n\\n “在等——在等一个稍微稳妥一点的时机。玛丽，她可不像她的两个表姐。我想我提出来可不能碰钉子。”\\n\\n “噢！不会的，你不会碰钉子。即使你不这么可爱——即使她还没有爱上你（可我毫不怀疑她已经爱上了你），你也会万无一失。她性情温柔，知恩图报，你只要一提出，她马上就会属于你。我打心眼里认为，她要是嫁给你是不会不爱你的。这就是说，如果世上还有一位姑娘不为虚荣所动的话，我想这个人就是她。不过，你尽管求她爱你好了，她是决不会狠心拒绝你的。”\\n\\n 玛丽那急切的心情一平静下来，亨利就乐滋滋地讲给她听，她也乐滋滋地听他讲。接着，两人便交谈起来，而且几乎同样兴致勃勃。不过，其实亨利除了自己的感情之外，并没有什么可讲的，除了范妮的妩媚之外，并没有什么可谈的。范妮那俏丽的面孔和袅娜的身段，她那文雅的举止和善良的心地，成了谈不完的话题。她那温柔、和悦、贤淑的性情，被热情洋溢地夸来夸去。在男人看来，这种温柔正是每一个女人最可贵的品质所在，虽然他有时爱上的女人并不温柔，但他从不认为对方有这样的缺欠。至于范妮的脾气，他有充足的理由去信赖，去赞扬。他经常看到她的脾气经受考验。这家人当中，除了埃德蒙以外，哪一个不在以这样那样的方式不断地考验她的耐心和包容？显然，她的感情是炽烈的。看她对她哥哥有多好啊！这岂不是最能证明她的心肠不仅是温柔的，而且也十分多情吗？对于一个眼看就要赢得她的爱情的男人来说，这不是莫大的鼓舞吗？此外，她的头脑也毋庸置疑，又聪慧又敏锐。她的言谈举止显示了她的稳重和涵养。还不止这些。事利·克劳福德虽然没有认真思考的习惯，说不出做妻子的应该具有哪些名目的美德，但他又很聪明，懂得妻子身上具有美德的价值。他谈到范妮为人稳重，行为得体，谈到她自尊自重，讲究礼仪，这就可以使人充分相信她会对丈夫忠贞不渝。他所以说这些话，是因为他知道她有高尚的道德准则，有虔诚的宗教信仰。\\n\\n “我可以不折不扣地信任她，”他说。“这正是我所需要的。”\\n\\n 他妹妹认为他对范妮·普莱斯的夸奖并不过分，因而对他的前景满怀喜悦。\\n\\n “我越琢磨这件事，”她嚷道，“越觉得你做得完全对。虽然我从来不曾认为范妮·普莱斯可能是最让你着迷的姑娘，但现在我相信她最能让你幸福。你原来搞恶作剧，想搅得她心神不宁，到头来还真成了神机妙算。这对你们两人都大有好处。”\\n\\n “当初我对这样好的人存心不良，真是太拙劣了！不过，那时我还不了解她。我要让她没有理由为我当初心里冒出这个念头感到遗憾。我要使她非常幸福，玛丽，比她以往任何时候都幸福，比她看到过的任何人都幸福。我不把她从北安普敦郡带走，我要把埃弗灵厄姆租出去，在这附近一带租幢房子，也许租下斯坦威克斯宅第。我要把埃弗灵厄姆租出去七年。我只要一开口，准能找到一个非常好的房客。我现在就能说出三个人，既会满足我的条件，又会感谢我。”\\n\\n “哈哈！”玛丽大声嚷道，“在北安普敦定居呀！这太好啦！那我们大家都在一起了。”\\n\\n 她话一出口，便省悟过来，后悔不该说这话。不过，她也不必慌张。她哥哥只当是她仍要住在曼斯菲尔德的牧师府上，因此作为回答，只是非常亲热地邀请她到他家做客，并且要她首先满足他的要求。\\n\\n “你必须把你一半以上的时间给我们，”他说。“我不允许格兰特太太跟范妮和我权利均等，我们俩对你都拥有一份权利。范妮将是你真诚的嫂嫂呀！”\\n\\n 玛丽只有表示感激，并含糊其词地做了许诺。但她既不打算长期在姐姐家里客居下去，也不愿意在哥哥家里久住。\\n\\n “你打算一年中在伦敦和北安普敦郡轮流住吗？”\\n\\n “是的。”\\n\\n “这就对了。你在伦敦自然要有自己的房子，不再住在将军家里。我最亲爱的亨利，离开将军对你有好处，趁你的教养还没有受到他的熏染伤害，趁他的那些愚蠢的见解还没有传染给你，趁你还没有学会一味地讲吃讲喝，好像吃喝是人生最大的幸福似的！你可不明白离开将军对你的好处，因为你对他的崇拜蒙蔽了你的眼睛。但是，在我看来，你早一点结婚可能会挽救你。眼见着你在言行、神情和姿态上越来越像将军，我会很伤心的。”\\n\\n “好了，好了，我们在这个问题上看法不大一样。将军有他的缺点，但他为人很好，对我胜过生身父亲。就是做父亲的也很少会像他这样，我干什么他都支持。你不能让范妮对他产生偏见。我要让他们彼此相爱。”\\n\\n 玛丽觉得，世上没有哪两个人像他们这样，从品格到礼貌教养这么格格不入，但她没有说出口，到时候他会明白的。不过，她却禁不住要对将军讲出这样的想法：“亨利，我觉得范妮·普莱斯这么好的一个人，要是我认为下一个克劳福德太太会受到我那可怜的婶婶所受的一半虐待，会像我那可怜的婶婶那样憎恨这个称呼，但凡有可能，我就会阻止这桩婚事。不过，我了解你。我知道，你爱的妻子会是最幸福的女人，即使你不再爱她了，她也会从你身上看到一位绅士的宽怀大度和良好教养。”\\n\\n 亨利口若悬河地做了回答，说的自然是要竭尽全力促使范妮-普莱斯幸福，要永远爱范妮·普莱斯。\\n\\n “玛丽，”亨利接着说，“你要是看到她今天上午如何关照她姨妈，那个温柔、耐心的劲头真是难以形容：满足她姨妈的种种愚蠢要求，跟她一起做活，替她做活，俯身做活时脸上飞起艳丽的红霞，随后又回到座位上，继续替那位蠢女人写信，她做这一切的时候显得十分柔顺，毫不做作，好像都是理所当然的事，她不需要一点时间归自己支配，她的头发总是梳得纹丝不乱，写信的时候一卷秀发耷拉到额前，不时地给甩回去。在这整个过程中，她还时不时地跟我说话，或者听我说话，好像我说什么她都爱听。你要是看到这种种情景，玛丽，你就不会认为有朝一日她对我的魅力会消失。”\\n\\n “我最亲爱的亨利，”玛丽嚷道，又突然打住，笑吟吟地望着他，“看到你这样一片痴情，我有多高兴啊！真让我欣喜万分。可是，拉什沃思太太和朱莉娅会怎么说呢？”\\n\\n “我不管她们怎么说，也不管她们怎么想。她们现在会意识到什么样的女人能讨我喜欢，能讨一个有头脑的人喜欢。我希望这一发现会给她们带来益处。她们现在会意识到她们的表妹受到了应得的待遇，我希望她们会真心诚意地为自己以往可恶的怠慢和冷酷感到羞愧。她们会恼火的，”亨利顿了顿，又以比较冷静的口吻补充说，“拉什沃思太太会大为恼火。这对她来说像是一粒苦药，也就是说，像别的苦药一样，先要苦上一阵，然后咽下去，再忘掉。我不是一个没有头脑的花花公子，尽管我是她钟情的对象，可我并不认为她的感情会比别的女人来得长久。是的，玛丽，我的范妮的确会感受到一种变化，感受到她身边的每个人在态度上，每天每时都在发生变化。一想到这都是我引起的，是我把她的身份抬高到她应得的高度，我真是乐不可支了。而现在，她寄人篱下，孤苦伶仃，没亲没友，受人冷落，被人遗忘。”\\n\\n “不，亨利，不是被所有的人，不是被所有的人遗忘，不是没亲没友，不是被人遗忘。她表哥埃德蒙从来没有忘记她。”\\n\\n “埃德蒙——不错，总的说来，我认为他对她挺好，托马斯爵士对她也不错，不过那是一个有钱有势、唠唠叨叨、独断独行的姨父的关心。托马斯爵士和埃德蒙加在一起能为她做什么？他们为她的幸福、安逸、体面和尊严所做的事，比起我将要为她做的事，又算得了什么？”\\n\\n \\n\\n
