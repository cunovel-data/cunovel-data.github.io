{"id":4616,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr. Crawford appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join them; he was asked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he had intended, and they all walked thither together.\n The family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their cleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny, and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever. Her poor mother now did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram\u0027s sister as she was but too apt to look. It often grieved her to the heart to think of the contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so little difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat.\n In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not to be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still continued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.\n Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year, always going directly after morning service and staying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met her acquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.\n Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long, somehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believed it, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his, and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made her uncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would be felt.\n The day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in its mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for a minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea, now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination of charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances under which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his arm, she would soon have known that she needed it, for she wanted strength for a two hours\u0027 saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week\u0027s previous inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual regular exercise; she had lost ground as to health since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now.\n The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself. They often stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the wall, some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund, Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature, and very well able to express his admiration. She had a few tender reveries now and then, which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her face without detection; and the result of these looks was, that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less blooming than it ought to be. She _said_ she was very well, and did not like to be supposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could not be salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield, where her own happiness, and his in seeing her, must be so much greater.\n \"You have been here a month, I think?\" said he.\n \"No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left Mansfield.\"\n \"You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a month.\"\n \"I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.\"\n \"And it is to be a two months\u0027 visit, is not?\"\n \"Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.\"\n \"And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?\"\n \"I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months\u0027 end.\"\n After a moment\u0027s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, \"I know Mansfield, I know its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger of your being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware that you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt\u0027s maid for you, without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough. I am considering your sister\u0027s health,\" said he, addressing himself to Susan, \"which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. She requires constant air and exercise. When you know her as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does, and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If, therefore\" (turning again to Fanny), \"you find yourself growing unwell, and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two months to be ended, _that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her only the slightest hint, she and I will immediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.\"\n Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.\n \"I am perfectly serious,\" he replied, \"as you perfectly know. And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition. Indeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long only as you positively say, in every letter to Mary, \u0027I am well,\u0027 and I know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be considered as well.\"\n Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of what she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He attended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own house, when he knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere.\n \"I wish you were not so tired,\" said he, still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house--\"I wish I left you in stronger health. Is there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an understanding with him. I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him before. The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow; I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try to displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man, to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than simple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?\"\n \"I advise! You know very well what is right.\"\n \"Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your judgment is my rule of right.\"\n \"Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you a pleasant journey to-morrow.\"\n \"Is there nothing I can do for you in town?\"\n \"Nothing; I am much obliged to you.\"\n \"Have you no message for anybody?\"\n \"My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him.\"\n \"Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses myself.\"\n He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He pressed her hand, looked at her, and was gone. _He_ went to while away the next three hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and _she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.\n Their general fare bore a very different character; and could he have suspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she endured in her father\u0027s house, he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca\u0027s puddings and Rebecca\u0027s hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives and forks, that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all, might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved, both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford\u0027s good company and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.\n Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low. It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in one light, glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and she could not think of his returning to town, and being frequently with Mary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them.\n Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her; a friend or two of her father\u0027s, as always happened if he was not with them, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o\u0027clock till half-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She was very low. The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast, she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it not be so in great? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling as he now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her?\n 第二天普莱斯一家人正要动身去做礼拜，克劳福德先生又来了。他不是来做客的，而是和他们一起去做礼拜。他们邀他一起去驻军教堂，这正中他的下怀，于是他们一道向驻军教堂走去。\n 这家人现在看上去还真不错。造物主给了他们不菲的美貌，每逢礼拜天他们就洗得干干净净，穿上最好的衣服。礼拜天常给范妮带来这种慰藉，这个礼拜天尤其如此。她那可怜的母亲往往看起来不配做伯特伦夫人的妹妹，今天就很像个样子。她想起来常常感到伤心，她母亲与伯特伦夫人差距太大，造物主给她们造成的差别那么小，环境给她们造成的差别却那么大。她母亲和伯特伦夫人一样漂亮，还比她年轻几岁，但比起她来形容这么枯槁憔悴，日子过得这么拮据，人这么邋遢，这么寒酸。不过，礼拜天却使她变成了一个非常体面、看上去乐滋滋的普莱斯太太，领着一群漂亮孩子，一时忘了平日的操心事，只是看到孩子们有什么危险，或者丽贝卡帽子上插着一朵花从她身边走过时，她才感到心烦。\n 进了小教堂，他们得分开就座，但克劳福德先生却尽量不跟几位女眷分开。做完礼拜之后，他仍然跟着她们，夹在她们中间走在大堤上。\n 一年四季，每逢星期天天朗气清，普莱斯太太都要在大堤上散散步，总是一做完礼拜便直接去那里，直到该吃正餐时才回去。这是她的交游场所，在这里见见熟人，听点新闻，谈谈朴次茅斯的仆人如何可恶，打起精神去应付接踵而来的六天生活。\n 现在他们就来到了这个地方。克劳福德先生极为高兴，认为两位普莱斯小姐是由他专门照顾的。到了大堤上不久，不知怎么地——说不清是怎么回事——范妮也完全没有想到，他居然走在她们姊妹俩中间，一边挽着一个人的胳膊，她不知道如何抵制，也不知道如何结束这种状况。这使她一时感到很不自在，然而由于风和日暖，景色绮丽，她还从中得到不少乐趣。\n 这一天天气特别宜人。其实只是3月，但天气温和，微风轻拂，阳光灿烂，偶尔掠过一抹乌云，完全像是4月光景。在这天气的感染下，万物显得绚丽多姿，在斯皮特黑德的舰船上，以及远处的海岛上，只见云影相逐，涨潮的海水色调变化莫测，大堤边的海浪澎湃激荡，发出悦耳的声响，种种魅力汇合在一起，逐渐地使范妮对眼下的处境几乎不在意了。而且，若不是克劳福德先生用手臂挽着她，她要不了多久就会意识到她需要这只手臂，因为她没有力气这样走两个钟头。一个星期不活动了，一般都会出现这种情况，范妮开始感到中断经常活动的影响，自到朴次茅斯以后，她的身体已经不如以前，如果不是克劳福德先生扶持，不是因为天公作美，她早该筋疲力尽了。\n 境劳福德先生像她一样感受到了天气宜人、景色迷人。他们常常情趣相投地停下脚步，依着墙欣赏一会。他虽然不是埃德蒙，范妮也不得不承认他能充分领略大自然的魅力，很能表达自己的赞叹之情。她有几次在凝神遐想，他趁机端详她的面孔，她却没有察觉。他发现她虽然还像过去一样迷人，但脸色却不像以前那样水灵了。她说她身体很好，不愿让别人另有看法。但是，从各方面看来，他认为她在这里的生活并不舒适，因而也不利于她的健康。他渴望她回到曼斯菲尔德，她在那里会快活得多，他自己在那里见到她也会快活得多。\n “我想你来这里有一个月了吧？”他说。\n “没有，还不满一个月。从离开曼斯菲尔德那天算起，到明天才四个星期。”\n “你算计得真精确，真实在呀。让我说，这就是一个月。”\n “我是星期二晚上才到这里的。”\n “你打算在这里住两个月，是吧？”\n “是的。我姨父说过住两个月。我想不会少于两个月。”\n “你到时候怎么回去呢？谁来接你呢？”\n “我也不知道。我姨妈来信还没提过这件事。也许我要多住些日子。一满两个月就来接我，恐怕没有那么方便。”\n 克劳福德先生思索了一会，说道：“我了解曼斯菲尔德，了解那里的情况，了解他们错待了你。我知道他们可能把你给忘了，是否关照你还得看家里人是否方便。我觉得，要是托马斯爵士亲自来接你或者派你姨妈的使女来接你会影响他下季度的计划，他们会让你一个礼拜一个礼拜地住下去。这样可不行。让你住两个月实在太长了，我看六个星期足够了。我担心你姐姐的身体，”他对苏珊说道，“朴次茅斯没有个活动的地方，这不利于她的身体。她需要经常透透气，活动活功。你要是像我一样了解她，我想你一定会认为她的确有这个需要，认为不应该让她长期脱离乡间的新鲜空气和自由自在的生活。因此（又转向范妮），你要是发现自己身体不好，不想住满两个月——这本来就没有什么大不了的，但是回曼斯菲尔德又有困难的话，你要是觉得身体不如从前，有什么不舒服的话，只需要告诉我妹妹，只需要向她稍微暗示一下，她和我就会马上赶来，把你送回曼斯菲尔德。你知道这对我是轻而易举的事，我也非常乐意这样做。你知道那时我们会是什么样的心情。”\n 范妮对他表示感谢，但是想要一笑了之。\n “我绝对是认真的，”克劳福德先生答道，“这你绝对是清楚的。我希望你要是有身体不适的迹象，可不要狠心地瞒着我们。真的，你不该隐瞒，你也不能隐瞒。这么久以来，你给玛丽的每一封信里都写明‘我很好’。我知道你不会说假话，也不会在信里撒谎，这么久以来，我们只当你身体很好。”\n 范妮再次向他道谢，但她情绪受到了影响，心里有些烦，也就不想多说话，甚至也不知道说什么好。这时他们也快走到终点了。他把她们陪到底，到了她们家门口才向她们告别。他知道她们就要吃饭了，便托辞说别处有人在等他。\n “真遗憾搞得你这么累，”别人都进到了房里，他仍然缠住范妮说。“真不忍心把你累成这样。要不要我在城里替你办什么事儿？我心里在琢磨是否最近再去一趟诺福克。我对麦迪逊很不满意。我敢说他还在设法骗我，想把他的一个亲戚弄到磨坊去，顶掉我想安排的人。我必须和他讲清楚。我要让他知道，他在埃弗灵厄姆的北边捉弄不了我，在埃弗灵厄姆的南边也蒙骗不了我，我的财产由我来当家。我以前对他还不够直言不讳。这样的人在庄园上做起坏事来，对主人的名誉和穷人的安康所造成的危害，简直令人难以置信。我真想立即回一趟诺福克，把什么事情都安排妥当，让他今后想捣鬼也捣不成。麦迪逊是个精明人，我不想撤换他——如果他不想取代我的话。不过，让一个我不欠他分毫的人捉弄我，那岂不是太傻了。而让他把一个硬心肠的、贪婪的家伙塞给我当佃户，顶掉一个我已基本答应要的正派人，那岂不是傻上加傻了。难道不是傻上加傻吗？我要不要去？你同意我去吗？”\n “我同意！你很清楚该怎么办。”\n “是的。听到你的意见，我就知道该怎么办了。你的意见就是我的是非准则。”\n “噢，不！不要这么说。我们人人都有自己的判断力，只要我们能听从自己的意见，那比听任何人的意见都好。再见，祝你明天旅途愉快。”\n “没有什么事要我在城里替你办吗？”\n “没有，谢谢你。”\n “不给谁捎个信吗？”\n “请代我问候你妹妹。你要是见到我表哥——埃德蒙表哥，劳驾你告诉他说——我想我很快会收到他的信。”\n “一定照办。要是他懒得动笔，或者不放在心上，我就写信告诉你他为什么不来信。”\n 克劳福德先生无法再说下去了，因为范妮不能再不进屋了。他紧紧地握了握她的手，看了看她，然后走掉了。他去和别的熟人一起消磨了三个小时，然后去一家头等饭店享受了一顿最佳的饭菜，而她却转身回家吃了一顿简单的晚餐。\n 她家的日常饮食与他的完全不同。他要是能想到她在父亲家里，除了没有户外活动外，还要吃多少苦的话，他会奇怪她的脸色怎么没受更大的影响，变得难看得多呢。丽贝卡做的布丁和肉末土豆泥，她简直没法吃，而且盛菜的盘子不干不净，吃饭用的刀叉更脏，她常常不得不拖延着不吃这丰盛的饭菜，到晚上打发弟弟给她买点饼干和面包。她是在曼斯菲尔德长大的，现在到朴次茅斯来磨练已经太晚了。托马斯爵士要是知道这一切，即便认为外甥女从身体到精神这样饥饿下去，倒有可能大为看重克劳福德先生的深情厚谊和丰裕资产，他大概也不敢把他的这种实验继续下去，不然，想纠正她的毛病却要了她的命。\n 范妮回来后，心情一直不好。虽然可以确保不再见到克劳福德先生，但她还是提不起精神。刚才跟她告别的这个人总还算是朋友，虽然从某种意义上说她很高兴摆脱了，但她现在像是被人人遗弃了似的，颇有几分再次离开曼斯菲尔德的滋味。她一想到他回城后会经常与玛丽和埃德蒙相聚，心里不免有点嫉妒，并因此而恨自己。\n 周围发生的事情丝毫没有减轻她的低落情绪。她父亲有一两个朋友，他要是不陪他们出去，他们总要在晚上来坐很长很长时间，从六点钟一直坐到九点半，不停地吵闹、喝酒。她心情十分沮丧。她唯一感到安慰的是，她觉得克劳福德先生取得了令人惊异的进步。她没有想到她过去是拿他和曼斯菲尔德的人相比，而现在是拿他和这里的人相比，两地的人大不相同，相比之下会有天壤之别。她深信他现在比过去文雅多了，对别人也关心多了。在小事情上如此，难道在大事情上就不会如此了吗？他这么关心她的身体和安适，这么体贴人，不仅表现在言语上，从神情上也看得出来，在这种情况下，难道不可以设想，要不了多久他就会不再令她这么讨厌地苦苦追求她吗？\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/316/3066.html","bookId":161,"book":{"id":161,"title":"曼斯菲尔德庄园 Mansfield Park","description":"简介： Mansfield Park is a novel by Jane Austen, written at Chawton Cottage between 1812 and 1814.
