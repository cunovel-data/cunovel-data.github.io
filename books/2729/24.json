She’s had a thing for you for a while and I figured it was only a matter of time before you got your head far enough out of your ass to see it. Plus both of you have been staring at your phones for the last week like they hold all the answers to the universe and looking like kicked puppies when they don’t have on them whatever it was you’re looking for.” I swore and worried my lip ring with my tongue. “You’re really gonna be cool if I tell you Shaw and I have been hooking up? Or are you going to hurt me?” “As long as it’s more than hooking up I will be cool as hell. Shaw isn’t one of your one night stands and if you’re treating her like she is I’ll break both your legs.” I scowled at him and flipped him off in the mirror. “What do you mean she’s been into me for a while? She got hammered one night and things got heated and I couldn’t stop it from happening so I figured why not roll with it. I like her. I mean I like spending time with her. She’s fun but she’s always so busy and this weekend she went back to Brookside with her weirdo ex because her mom told her too. I just don’t know that I can hang out with someone like that. She’s twenty years old, she should be living her own life, not bowing down to her parent’s every whim.” “So let me guess, instead of having a rational, reasonable conversation with her about it where you laid out your concerns you probably just shut her out and refused to talk to her while you seethed and festered in your own anger.” I shrugged a shoulder. “Rule, Shaw has known you for a long time. Can you imagine what she’s thinking you’re out doing while you’re ignoring her? Come on brother use your head for one bloody second. Is it worth it to ruin it all before you even get it started? That girl sees you, I mean really sees you and I think she has since the very beginning when everyone was always looking around you to see Remy. You need to stop being stubborn and make things right with her.” “She went with her ex, Rome.” “Yeah and you went out last night and let some skank shove her tongue down your throat. Not everyone operates off the same script Rule. Most people want to make their parents happy, want to have them approve with what they are doing with their lives, not everyone can burn every bridge the way you do. Most people want a way back home.” I cringed a little because he words hit right at the center of me. Had I been just a little drunker, just a little stupider I probably would have made a mistake last night that there was no going back from. Luckily the redhead had tasted like sticky sweet lip gloss and smelled like cheap floral perfume and had none of the softness or perfectness of how it felt being lip locked with Shaw so I had sent her on her way and felt like shit for the rest of the night. I knew I was going to have to talk to Shaw. I couldn’t keep going on like this or I was going to purposely end up sabotaging everything that was building between us. “It freaks me out Rome.” “Why?” “You know why. Once someone is in it kills when they leave.” “Come on Rule, the people that care enough to get in normally don’t want to leave. Just look around you, I’m still here, Nash hasn’t gone anywhere, Jet and Rowdy would kill for you and if you took a minute to think about it Shaw has been there just as long. You might have thought she was there for Remy because he always watched out for you and protected her, but I think you’re smart enough to realize now that maybe she was trying to take care of you for another reason all together.” He let the weights clatter to the rack with a thud and turned to look at me out of cool eyes. “Grow up Rule, stop acting like a spoiled brat that can’t live outside his brother’s shadow. You have an amazing, successful career, a solid group of friends, a family that might be broken but loves you none the less and you have a pretty spectacular girl just waiting for you to realize she’s yours for the taking.” “Man when you go big brother you go all out.” He rolled his eyes at me as we made our way to the locker room. I shrugged back into my street clothes and shot a quick glance at my phone. My heart constricted in my chest when I saw the message she had sent. I could practically hear how sad she was in the words. I really was an asshole; I could have talked to her instead of sending her off with that jackass without a word. I was trying to think of something to write her back when Rome thunked me on the back of the head with his palm. “Let’s go.” “I have to be to work at noon anyways. Hey Rome,” I waited until he turned and looked me in the eye. “What about mom and dad?” “What about them?” “Me and Shaw. If I get it figured out, if I manage not to screw it up royally what am I supposed to do about them? They would never understand.” “Who cares? You deserve to be happy and so does Shaw. Remy is gone and that’s just the way it is.” I cleared my throat and ran my hand across the back of my neck. “Yeah well Shaw was never with Remy that way.” His eyes got big and his mouth sort of dropped open. “Do I want to know how you know that?” “Probably not, but let’s just say I know for a fact she and Remy didn’t have a relationship like that.” “Well regardless it isn’t any of mom and dad’s business.” I sighed again. “Yeah I guess.” We parted ways and I made my way to the shop. I had a busy day with clients back to back and I was still committed to going to the show with the guys that night, plus Brent the lead singer of the band was a good client and I got a lot of good press out of having my work on him since Artifice had blown up over the last few years. I went home and changed and got ready to roll out with the boys but my mind was still on Shaw and the text she sent me this morning. She had hurt me and while I was too hardheaded to admit it that was the reason I had pulled away. I didn’t want her around the ex because logically he was a better match for her and I didn’t want to come up short. By shoving her away and not giving her a chance to talk about it, or a chance for us to work it through I was cutting off any chance at rejection or being found lacking before it could start. I was an idiot, of all the people in my life Shaw had never been one to make me feel like I was less than anything. Yeah she could be judgmental and chilly when she was feeling pressured and cornered, but she never made me feel like I wasn’t enough. The show was awesome; we got treated like rock stars because we were backstage and knew the band. The girls that were around were tempting and alluring but when it came time for the after party I dipped out early and went home by myself. I took a shower and crawled into bed still staring at my phone. Not able to contain it anymore I finally sent her a text back. - I kissed some chick last night. I held my breath because I didn’t know what she was going to write back. I was fully prepared for her to tell me it was over, that I had gone too far but nothing came. I stared at the screen for a good twenty minutes, my heart racing and still nothing came through. - I’m sorry, I didn’t do it to hurt you I’m just an idiot and this is harder than I thought. There still wasn’t a response and I felt that weird slither in my chest that was tied to Shaw start to shatter. All I knew was I had to fix this, that I wasn’t ready to let her go just yet. Rome was right I needed to grow up. I hadn’t even given this a fair shot, as usual my hot head was writing checks the rest of me wasn’t prepared to cash. I tossed and turned all night, she never called or texted me back and I began to panic. I heard Nash stumble in at some point after four and I hoped Rome slept through it. I got up the next morning and started moving around the apartment at a frantic pace. I brushed my teeth and shoved a bagel in my mouth. I tore through my closet to find the one shirt I owned that had buttons on it and found the single pair of black Dickie pants I had that weren’t jeans. I put a black hoodie on and a pin-striped blazer over it and bounded out the door all while my brother and roommate looked at me like I had lost my mind. “I’ll be back later.” “Where are you going? To church?” Nash looked a little worse for wear and Rome was just watching me knowingly. “I need to talk to Shaw.” “So call her.” “She isn’t answering her phone.” “You think her mom’s just gonna let you roll up to the house and let you in?” “I don’t care; I need to talk to her so I’m going to talk to her.” Rome winked at me and saluted me with his coffee cup. “Atta boy. Call me if they have you arrested I will totally come get you out.” “Later.” I had to stop and put gas in the truck and for whatever reason there was a ton of traffic going out of town. I was impatient and ready to have a fit of serious road rage by the time I finally got to Brookside. I tried to call her one more time and was sent right to voicemail, I almost crushed the phone in my hand when her recorded greeting cheerily told me to just leave a message. I knew where her mom lived because I had been forced to pick her up more than once and bring her to our house when I still shared a car with Remy. I followed the car in front of me through the gates and found the house with no problem. There was a menagerie of all kinds of expensive and fancy cars that seriously had no place being in Colorado parked out front the chalet style mansion. I jogged up the front steps and rang the doorbell. I was expecting a maid or maybe some fancy ass butler to open the door, what I wasn’t expecting was an older, harder version of Shaw. There was no doubt this woman was Shaw’s mother, they had the same white blond hair, the same piercing green eyes, but where Shaw was delicate and lovely, this woman looked like she had been carved out of a solid block of ice. I saw her eyes narrow and sharpen when she saw me but I was on a mission and I didn’t care who this chick was she wasn’t going to stand in my way, even if I had to run her over. “I need to talk to Shaw.” Her mouth pulled tight and she put her small body solidly in the doorway. “You’re Margot and Dale’s boy aren’t you?” “One of them.” We weren’t friends, were never going to be and she was making that clear. “What do you want with my daughter?” “That’s personal. I just need to speak with her for a minute then I’ll be on my way.” “You’re interrupting a private gathering; Shaw is here with her boyfriend I don’t think she wants to see you.” I fought back an eye roll. The lady was manipulative and delivered it like it was fact, but I wasn’t stupid so I just stared back at her. “Davenport is a stalker not her boyfriend. Just get her for me would ya?” I could see that my lack of respect was starting to get under her too tight skin.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rule-marked-men-1/page-24.html","bookId":2729,"book":{"id":2729,"title":"Rule (Marked Men #1)","description":"Storyline: Rule (Marked Men #1) Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him.
