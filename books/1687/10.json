{"id":64030,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"PART II \"THE ASSAULT\" 10 The scream begins in my lower back and works its way up through my body only to jam in my throat. I am Avox mute, choking on my grief. Even if I could release the muscles in my neck, let the sound tear into space, would anyone notice it? The room\u0027s in an uproar. Questions and demands ring out as they try to decipher Peeta\u0027s words. \"And you...in Thirteen...dead by morning!\" Yet no one is asking about the messenger whose blood has been replaced by static. A voice calls the others to attention. \"Shut up!\" Every pair of eyes falls on Haymitch. \"It\u0027s not some big mystery! The boy\u0027s telling us we\u0027re about to be attacked. Here. In Thirteen.\" \"How would he have that information?\" \"Why should we trust him?\" \"How do you know?\" Haymitch gives a growl of frustration. \"They\u0027re beating him bloody while we speak. What more do you need? Katniss, help me out here!\" I have to give myself a shake to free my words. \"Haymitch\u0027s right. I don\u0027t know where Peeta got the information. Or if it\u0027s true. But he believes it is. And they\u0027re - \" I can\u0027t say aloud what Snow\u0027s doing to him. \"You don\u0027t know him,\" Haymitch says to Coin. \"We do. Get your people ready.\" The president doesn\u0027t seem alarmed, only somewhat perplexed, by this turn in events. She mulls over the words, tapping one finger lightly on the rim of the control board in front of her. When she speaks, she addresses Haymitch in an even voice. \"Of course, we have prepared for such a scenario. Although we have decades of support for the assumption that further direct attacks on Thirteen would be counterproductive to the Capitol\u0027s cause. Nuclear missiles would release radiation into the atmosphere, with incalculable environmental results. Even routine bombing could badly damage our military compound, which we know they hope to regain. And, of course, they invite a counterstrike. It is conceivable that, given our current alliance with the rebels, those would be viewed as acceptable risks.\" \"You think so?\" says Haymitch. It\u0027s a shade too sincere, but the subtleties of irony are often wasted in13. \"I do. At any rate, we\u0027re overdue for a Level Five security drill,\" says Coin. \"Let\u0027s proceed with the lockdown.\" She begins to type rapidly on her keyboard, authorizing her decision. The moment she raises her head, it begins. There have been two low-level drills since I arrived in 13. I don\u0027t remember much about the first. I was in intensive care in the hospital and I think the patients were exempted, as the complications of removing us for a practice drill outweighed the benefits. I was vaguely aware of a mechanical voice instructing people to congregate in yellow zones. During the second, a Level Two drill meant for minor crises - such as a temporary quarantine while citizens were tested for contagion during a flu outbreak - we were supposed to return to our living quarters. I stayed behind a pipe in the laundry room, ignored the pulsating beeps coming over the audio system, and watched a spider construct a web. Neither experience has prepared me for the wordless, eardrum-piercing, fear-inducing sirens that now permeate 13. There would be no disregarding this sound, which seems designed to throw the whole population into a frenzy. But this is 13 and that doesn\u0027t happen. Boggs guides Finnick and me out of Command, along the hall to a doorway, and onto a wide stairway. Streams of people are converging to form a river that flows only downward. No one shrieks or tries to push ahead. Even the children don\u0027t resist. We descend, flight after flight, speechless, because no word could be heard above this sound. I look for my mother and Prim, but it\u0027s impossible to see anyone but those immediately around me. They\u0027re both working in the hospital tonight, though, so there\u0027s no way they can miss the drill. My ears pop and my eyes feel heavy. We are coal-mine deep. The only plus is that the farther we retreat into the earth, the less shrill the sirens become. It\u0027s as if they were meant to physically drive us away from the surface, which I suppose they are. Groups of people begin to peel off into marked doorways and still Boggs directs me downward, until finally the stairs end at the edge of an enormous cavern. I start to walk straight in and Boggs stops me, shows me that I must wave my schedule in front of a scanner so that I\u0027m accounted for. No doubt the information\u0027s going to some computer somewhere to make sure no one\u0027s gone astray. The place seems unable to decide if it\u0027s natural or man-made. Certain areas of the walls are stone, while steel beams and concrete heavily reinforce others. Sleeping bunks are hewn right into the rock walls. There\u0027s a kitchen, bathrooms, a first-aid station. This place was designed for an extended stay. White signs with letters or numbers are placed at intervals around the cavern. As Boggs tells Finnick and me to report to the area that matches our assigned quarters - in my case E for Compartment E - Plutarch strolls up. \"Ah, here you are,\" he says. Recent events have had little effect on Plutarch\u0027s mood. He still has a happy glow from Beetee\u0027s success on the Airtime Assault. Eyes on the forest, not on the trees. Not on Peeta\u0027s punishment or 13\u0027s imminent blasting. \"Katniss, obviously this is a bad moment for you, what with Peeta\u0027s setback, but you need to be aware that others will be watching you.\" \"What?\" I say. I can\u0027t believe he actually just downgraded Peeta\u0027s dire circumstances to a setback. \"The other people in the bunker, they\u0027ll be taking their cue on how to react from you. If you\u0027re calm and brave, others will try to be as well. If you panic, it could spread like wildfire,\" explains Plutarch. I just stare at him. \"Fire is catching, so to speak,\" he continues, as if I\u0027m being slow on the uptake. \"Why don\u0027t I just pretend I\u0027m on camera, Plutarch?\" I say. \"Yes! Perfect. One is always much braver with an audience,\" he says. \"Look at the courage Peeta just displayed!\" It\u0027s all I can do not to slap him. \"I\u0027ve got to get back to Coin before lockdown. You keep up the good work!\" he says, and then heads off. I cross to the big letter E posted on the wall. Our space consists of a twelve-by-twelve-foot square of stone floor delineated by painted lines. Carved into the wall are two bunks - one of us will be sleeping on the floor - and a ground-level cube space for storage. A piece of white paper, coated in clear plastic, reads BUNKERPROTOCOL . I stare fixedly at the little black specks on the sheet. For a while, they\u0027re obscured by the residual blood droplets that I can\u0027t seem to wipe from my vision. Slowly, the words come into focus. The first section is entitled \"On Arrival.\" 1. Make sure all members of your Compartment are accounted for. My mother and Prim haven\u0027t arrived, but I was one of the first people to reach the bunker. Both of them are probably helping to relocate hospital patients. 2. Go to the Supply Station and secure one pack for each member of your Compartment. Ready your Living Area. Return pack(s). I scan the cavern until I locate the Supply Station, a deep room set off by a counter. People wait behind it, but there\u0027s not a lot of activity there yet. I walk over, give our compartment letter, and request three packs. A man checks a sheet, pulls the specified packs from shelving, and swings them up onto the counter. After sliding one on my back and getting a grip on the other two with my hands, I turn to find a group rapidly forming behind me. \"Excuse me,\" I say as I carry my supplies through the others. Is it a matter of timing? Or is Plutarch right? Are these people modeling their behavior on mine? Back at our space, I open one of the packs to find a thin mattress, bedding, two sets of gray clothing, a toothbrush, a comb, and a flashlight. On examining the contents of the other packs, I find the only discernible difference is that they contain both gray and white outfits. The latter will be for my mother and Prim, in case they have medical duties. After I make up the beds, store the clothes, and return the backpacks, I\u0027ve got nothing to do but observe the last rule. 3. Await further instructions. I sit cross-legged on the floor to await. A steady flow of people begins to fill the room, claiming spaces, collecting supplies. It won\u0027t take long until the place is full up. I wonder if my mother and Prim are going to stay the night at wherever the hospital patients have been taken. But, no, I don\u0027t think so. They were on the list here. I\u0027m starting to get anxious, when my mother appears. I look behind her into a sea of strangers. \"Where\u0027s Prim?\" I ask. \"Isn\u0027t she here?\" she replies. \"She was supposed to come straight down from the hospital. She left ten minutes before I did. Where is she? Where could she have gone?\" I squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment, to track her as I would prey on a hunt. See her react to the sirens, rush to help the patients, nod as they gesture for her to descend to the bunker, and then hesitate with her on the stairs. Torn for a moment. But why? My eyes fly open. \"The cat! She went back for him!\" \"Oh, no,\" my mother says. We both know I\u0027m right. We\u0027re pushing against the incoming tide, trying to get out of the bunker. Up ahead, I can see them preparing to shut the thick metal doors. Slowly rotating the metal wheels on either side inward. Somehow I know that once they have been sealed, nothing in the world will convince the soldiers to open them. Perhaps it will even be beyond their control. I\u0027m indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout for them to wait. The space between the doors shrinks to a yard, a foot; there are only a few inches left when I jam my hand through the crack. \"Open it! Let me out!\" I cry. Consternation shows on the soldiers\u0027 faces as they reverse the wheels a bit. Not enough to let me pass, but enough to avoid crushing my fingers. I take the opportunity to wedge my shoulder into the opening. \"Prim!\" I holler up the stairs. My mother pleads with the guards as I try to wriggle my way out. \"Prim!\" Then I hear it. The faint sound of footsteps on the stairs. \"We\u0027re coming!\" I hear my sister call. \"Hold the door!\" That was Gale. \"They\u0027re coming!\" I tell the guards, and they slide the doors open about a foot. But I don\u0027t dare move - afraid they\u0027ll lock us all out - until Prim appears, her cheeks flushed with running, hauling Buttercup. I pull her inside and Gale follows, twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get it into the bunker. The doors are closed with a loud and final clank. \"What were you thinking?\" I give Prim an angry shake and then hug her, squashing Buttercup between us. Prim\u0027s explanation is already on her lips. \"I couldn\u0027t leave him behind, Katniss. Not twice. You should have seen him pacing the room and howling. He\u0027d come back to protect us.\" \"Okay. Okay.\" I take a few breaths to calm myself, step back, and lift Buttercup by the scruff of the neck. \"I should\u0027ve drowned you when I had the chance.\" His ears flatten and he raises a paw. I hiss before he gets a chance, which seems to annoy him a little, since he considers hissing his own personal sound of contempt. In retaliation, he gives a helpless kitten mew that brings my sister immediately to his defense. \"Oh, Katniss, don\u0027t tease him,\" she says, folding him back in her arms. \"He\u0027s already so upset.\" The idea that I\u0027ve wounded the brute\u0027s tiny cat feelings just invites further taunting. But Prim\u0027s genuinely distressed for him. So instead, I visualize Buttercup\u0027s fur lining a pair of gloves, an image that has helped me deal with him over the years. \"Okay, sorry. We\u0027re under the bigE on the wall. Better get him settled in before he loses it.\" Prim hurries off, and I find myself face-to-face with Gale. He\u0027s holding the box of medical supplies from our kitchen in 12. Site of our last conversation, kiss, fallout, whatever. My game bag\u0027s slung across his shoulder. \"If Peeta\u0027s right, these didn\u0027t stand a chance,\" he says. Peeta. Blood like raindrops on the window. Like wet mud on boots. \"Thanks for...everything.\" I take our stuff. \"What were you doing up in our rooms?\" \"Just double-checking,\" he says. \"We\u0027re in Forty-Seven if you need me.\" Practically everyone withdrew to their spaces when the doors shut, so I get to cross to our new home with at least five hundred people watching me. I try to appear extra calm to make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd. Like that\u0027s fooling anyone. So much for setting an example. Oh, who cares? They all think I\u0027m nuts anyway. One man, who I think I knocked to the floor, catches my eye and rubs his elbow resentfully. I almost hiss at him, too. Prim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk, draped in a blanket so that only his face pokes out. This is how he likes to be when there\u0027s thunder, the one thing that actually frightens him. My mother puts her box carefully in the cube. I crouch, my back supported by the wall, to check what Gale managed to rescue in my hunting bag. The plant book, the hunting jacket, my parents\u0027 wedding photo, and the personal contents of my drawer. My mockingjay pin now lives with Cinna\u0027s outfit, but there\u0027s the gold locket and the silver parachute with the spile and Peeta\u0027s pearl. I knot the pearl into the corner of the parachute, bury it deep in the recesses of the bag, as if it\u0027s Peeta\u0027s life and no one can take it away as long as I guard it. The faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply. Coin\u0027s voice comes over the district audio system, thanking us all for an exemplary evacuation of the upper levels. She stresses that this is not a drill, as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 victor, has possibly made a televised reference to an attack on 13 tonight. That\u0027s when the first bomb hits. There\u0027s an initial sense of impact followed by an explosion that resonates in my innermost parts, the lining of my intestines, the marrow of my bones, the roots of my teeth.We\u0027re all going to die, I think. My eyes turn upward, expecting to see giant cracks race across the ceiling, massive chunks of stone raining down on us, but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudder. The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of total darkness. Speechless human sounds - spontaneous shrieks, ragged breaths, baby whimpers, one musical bit of insane laughter - dance around in the charged air. Then there\u0027s a hum of a generator, and a dim wavering glow replaces the stark lighting that is the norm in 13. It\u0027s closer to what we had in our homes in 12, when the candles and fire burned low on a winter\u0027s night. I reach for Prim in the twilight, clamp my hand on her leg, and pull myself over to her. Her voice remains steady as she croons to Buttercup. \"It\u0027s all right, baby, it\u0027s all right. We\u0027ll be okay down here.\" My mother wraps her arms around us. I allow myself to feel young for a moment and rest my head on her shoulder. \"That was nothing like the bombs in Eight,\" I say. \"Probably a bunker missile,\" says Prim, keeping her voice soothing for the cat\u0027s sake. \"We learned about them during the orientation for new citizens. They\u0027re designed to penetrate deep in the ground before they go off. Because there\u0027s no point in bombing Thirteen on the surface anymore.\" \"Nuclear?\" I ask, feeling a chill run through me. \"Not necessarily,\" says Prim. \"Some just have a lot of explosives in them. But...it could be either kind, I guess.\" The gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doors at the end of the bunker. Would they be any protection against a nuclear attack? And even if they were one hundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation, which is really unlikely, would we ever be able to leave this place? The thought of spending whatever remains of my life in this stone vault horrifies me. I want to run madly for the door and demand to be released into whatever lies above. It\u0027s pointless. They would never let me out, and I might start some kind of stampede. \"We\u0027re so far down, I\u0027m sure we\u0027re safe,\" says my mother wanly. Is she thinking of my father\u0027s being blown to nothingness in the mines? \"It was a close call, though. Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us.\" The wherewithal. A general term that somehow includes everything that was needed for him to sound the alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. And something else I can\u0027t define. Peeta seemed to have been waging a sort of battle in his mind, fighting to get the message out. Why? The ease with which he manipulates words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of his torture? Something more? Like madness? Coin\u0027s voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the bunker, the volume level flickering with the lights. \"Apparently, Peeta Mellark\u0027s information was sound and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first missile was not nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more will follow. For the duration of the attack, citizens are to stay in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified.\" A soldier alerts my mother that she\u0027s needed in the first-aid station. She\u0027s reluctant to leave us, even though she\u0027ll only be thirty yards away. \"We\u0027ll be fine, really,\" I tell her. \"Do you think anything could get past him?\" I point to Buttercup, who gives me such a halfhearted hiss, we all have to laugh a little. Even I feel sorry for him. After my mother goes, I suggest, \"Why don\u0027t you climb in with him, Prim?\" \"I know it\u0027s silly...but I\u0027m afraid the bunk might collapse on us during the attack,\" she says. If the bunks collapse, the whole bunker will have given way and buried us, but I decide this kind of logic won\u0027t actually be helpful. Instead, I clean out the storage cube and make Buttercup a bed inside. Then I pull a mattress in front of it for my sister and me to share. We\u0027re given clearance in small groups to use the bathroom and brush our teeth, although showering has been canceled for the day. I curl up with Prim on the mattress, double layering the blankets because the cavern emits a dank chill. Buttercup, miserable even with Prim\u0027s constant attention, huddles in the cube and exhales cat breath in my face. Despite the disagreeable conditions, I\u0027m glad to have time with my sister. My extreme preoccupation since I came here - no, since the first Games, really - has left little attention for her. I haven\u0027t been watching over her the way I should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked our compartment, not me. Something to make up for. I realize I\u0027ve never even bothered to ask her about how she\u0027s handling the shock of coming here. \"So, how are you liking Thirteen, Prim?\" I offer. \"Right now?\" she asks. We both laugh. \"I miss home badly sometimes. But then I remember there\u0027s nothing left to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don\u0027t have to worry about you. Well, not the same way.\" She pauses, and then a shy smile crosses her lips. \"I think they\u0027re going to train me to be a doctor.\" It\u0027s the first I\u0027ve heard of it. \"Well, of course, they are. They\u0027d be stupid not to.\" \"They\u0027ve been watching me when I help out in the hospital. I\u0027m already taking the medic courses. It\u0027s just beginner\u0027s stuff. I know a lot of it from home. Still, there\u0027s plenty to learn,\" she tells me. \"That\u0027s great,\" I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn\u0027t even dream of it in 12. Something small and quiet, like a match being struck, lights up the gloom inside me. This is the sort of future a rebellion could bring. \"What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?\" Her fingertip moves in short, gentle strokes between Buttercup\u0027s eyes. \"And don\u0027t say you\u0027re fine.\" It\u0027s true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that\u0027s what I am. So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta, his deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must be killing him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for a while, because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling me closer, brushing the hair back behind my ears with her fingers. I\u0027ve stopped talking because there\u0027s really nothing left to say and there\u0027s this piercing sort of pain where my heart is. Maybe I\u0027m even having a heart attack, but it doesn\u0027t seem worth mentioning. \"Katniss, I don\u0027t think President Snow will kill Peeta,\" she says. Of course, she says this; it\u0027s what she thinks will calm me. But her next words come as a surprise. \"If he does, he won\u0027t have anyone left you want. He won\u0027t have any way to hurt you.\" Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer. Johanna Mason, the tribute from District 7, in the last arena. I was trying to prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she brushed me off, saying, \"They can\u0027t hurt me. I\u0027m not like the rest of you. There\u0027s no one left I love.\" Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to waste Peeta\u0027s life, especially now, while the Mockingjay causes so much havoc. He\u0027s killed Cinna already. Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch are out of his reach. Peeta\u0027s all he has left. \"So, what do you think they\u0027ll do to him?\" I ask. Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she speaks. \"Whatever it takes to break you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-10.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) My name is Katniss Everdeen.
