{"id":64031,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"11\n What will break me?\n This is the question that consumes me over the next three days as we wait to be released from our prison of safety. What will break me into a million pieces so that I am beyond repair, beyond usefulness? I mention it to no one, but it devours my waking hours and weaves itself throughout my nightmares.\n Four more bunker missiles fall over this period, all massive, all very damaging, but there\u0027s no urgency to the attack. The bombs are spread out over the long hours so that just when you think the raid is over, another blast sends shock waves through your guts. It feels more designed to keep us in lockdown than to decimate 13. Cripple the district, yes. Give the people plenty to do to get the place running again. But destroy it? No. Coin was right on that point. You don\u0027t destroy what you want to acquire in the future. I assume what they really want, in the short term, is to stop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off the televisions of Panem.\n We receive next to no information about what is happening. Our screens never come on, and we get only brief audio updates from Coin about the nature of the bombs. Certainly, the war is still being waged, but as to its status, we\u0027re in the dark.\n Inside the bunker, cooperation is the order of the day. We adhere to a strict schedule for meals and bathing, exercise and sleep. Small periods of socialization are granted to alleviate the tedium. Our space becomes very popular because both children and adults have a fascination with Buttercup. He attains celebrity status with his evening game of Crazy Cat. I created this by accident a few years ago, during a winter blackout. You simply wiggle a flashlight beam around on the floor, and Buttercup tries to catch it. I\u0027m petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makes him look stupid. Inexplicably, everyone here thinks he\u0027s clever and delightful. I\u0027m even issued a special set of batteries - an enormous waste - to be used for this purpose. The citizens of 13 are truly starved for entertainment.\n It\u0027s on the third night, during our game, that I answer the question eating away at me. Crazy Cat becomes a metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, the thing I want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under his paws, he\u0027s bristling with aggression. (That\u0027s how I\u0027ve been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.) When the light goes out completely, Buttercup\u0027s temporarily distraught and confused, but he recovers and moves on to other things. (That\u0027s what would happen if Peeta died.) But the one thing that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on the wall, beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall, wails, and can\u0027t be comforted or distracted. He\u0027s useless until I shut the light off. (That\u0027s what Snow is trying to do to me now, only I don\u0027t know what form his game takes.)\n Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs. Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinking that he\u0027s being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is unendurable. And it\u0027s under the weight of this revelation that I truly begin to break.\n After Crazy Cat, we\u0027re directed to bed. The power\u0027s been coming and going; sometimes the lamps burn at full brightness, other times we squint at one another in the brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness and activate safety lights in each space. Prim, who\u0027s decided the walls will hold up, snuggles with Buttercup on the lower bunk. My mother\u0027s on the upper. I offer to take a bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I flail around so much when I\u0027m sleeping.\n I\u0027m not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the tension of holding myself together. The pain over my heart returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over my face, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange, razor-sharp shards.\n When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into sleep, I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe through the cavern until I find Finnick, feeling for some unspecified reason that he will understand. He sits under the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even pretending to rest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow\u0027s plan to break me, it dawns on me. This strategy is very old news to Finnick. It\u0027s what broke him.\n \"This is what they\u0027re doing to you with Annie, isn\u0027t it?\" I ask.\n \"Well, they didn\u0027t arrest her because they thought she\u0027d be a wealth of rebel information,\" he says.\n \"They know I\u0027d never have risked telling her anything like that. For her own protection.\"\n \"Oh, Finnick. I\u0027m so sorry,\" I say.\n \"No, I\u0027m sorry. That I didn\u0027t warn you somehow,\" he tells me.\n Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I\u0027m strapped to my bed, mad with rage and grief after the rescue. Finnick is trying to console me about Peeta. \"They\u0027ll figure out he doesn\u0027t know anything pretty fast. And they won\u0027t kill him if they think they can use him against you.\"\n \"You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only when you said they\u0027d use Peeta against me, I thought you meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow,\" I say.\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have said even that. It was too late for it to be of any help to you. Since I hadn\u0027t warned you before the Quarter Quell, I should\u0027ve shut up about how Snow operates.\" Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an intricate knot becomes a straight line again. \"It\u0027s just that I didn\u0027t understand when I met you. After your first Games, I thought the whole romance was an act on your part. We all expected you\u0027d continue that strategy. But it wasn\u0027t until Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I - \" Finnick hesitates.\n I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick revived Peeta. The quizzical look on Finnick\u0027s face. The way he excused my behavior, blaming it on my pretend pregnancy. \"That you what?\"\n \"That I knew I\u0027d misjudged you. That you do love him. I\u0027m not saying in what way. Maybe you don\u0027t know yourself. But anyone paying attention could see how much you care about him,\" he says gently.\n Anyone? On Snow\u0027s visit before the Victory Tour, he challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta. \"Convince me,\" Snow said. It seems, under that hot pink sky with Peeta\u0027s life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I gave him the weapon he needed to break me.\n Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the knots bloom and vanish, before I can ask, \"How do you bear it?\"\n Finnick looks at me in disbelief. \"I don\u0027t, Katniss! Obviously, I don\u0027t. I drag myself out of nightmares each morning and find there\u0027s no relief in waking.\" Something in my expression stops him. \"Better not to give in to it. It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.\"\n Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing myself back into one piece.\n \"The more you can distract yourself, the better,\" he says. \"First thing tomorrow, we\u0027ll get you your own rope. Until then, take mine.\"\n I spend the rest of the night on my mattress obsessively making knots, holding them up for Buttercup\u0027s inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out of the air and bites it a few times to make sure it\u0027s dead. By morning, my fingers are sore, but I\u0027m still holding on.\n With twenty-four hours of quiet behind us, Coin finally announces we can leave the bunker. Our old quarters have been destroyed by the bombings. Everyone must follow exact directions to their new compartments. We clean our spaces, as directed, and file obediently toward the door.\n Before I\u0027m halfway there, Boggs appears and pulls me from the line. He signals for Gale and Finnick to join us. People move aside to let us by. Some even smile at me since the Crazy Cat game seems to have made me more lovable. Out the door, up the stairs, down the hall to one of those multidirectional elevators, and finally we arrive at Special Defense. Nothing along our route has been damaged, but we are still very deep.\n Boggs ushers us into a room virtually identical to Command. Coin, Plutarch, Haymitch, Cressida, and everybody else around the table looks exhausted. Someone has finally broken out the coffee - although I\u0027m sure it\u0027s viewed only as an emergency stimulant - and Plutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cup as if at any moment it might be taken away.\n There\u0027s no small talk. \"We need all four of you suited up and aboveground,\" says the president. \"You have two hours to get footage showing the damage from the bombing, establish that Thirteen\u0027s military unit remains not only functional but dominant, and, most important, that the Mockingjay is still alive. Any questions?\"\n \"Can we have a coffee?\" asks Finnick.\n Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at the shiny black liquid, never having been much of a fan of the stuff, but thinking it might help me stay on my feet. Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into the sugar bowl. \"Want a sugar cube?\" he asks in his old seductive voice. That\u0027s how we met, with Finnick offering me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumed and painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I had any idea what made him tick. The memory actually coaxes a smile out of me. \"Here, it improves the taste,\" he says in his real voice, plunking three cubes in my cup.\n As I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay, I catch Gale watching me and Finnick unhappily. What now? Does he actually think something\u0027s going on between us? Maybe he saw me go to Finnick\u0027s last night. I would\u0027ve passed the Hawthornes\u0027 space to get there. I guess that probably rubbed him the wrong way. Me seeking out Finnick\u0027s company instead of his. Well, fine. I\u0027ve got rope burn on my fingers, I can barely hold my eyes open, and a camera crew\u0027s waiting for me to do something brilliant. And Snow\u0027s got Peeta. Gale can think whatever he wants.\n In my new Remake Room in Special Defense, my prep team slaps me into my Mockingjay suit, arranges my hair, and applies minimal makeup before my coffee\u0027s even cooled. In ten minutes, the cast and crew of the next propos are making the circuitous trek to the outside. I slurp my coffee as we travel, finding that the cream and sugar greatly enhance its flavor. As I knock back the dregs that have settled to the bottom of the cup, I feel a slight buzz start to run through my veins.\n After climbing a final ladder, Boggs hits a lever that opens a trapdoor. Fresh air rushes in. I take big gulps and for the first time allow myself to feel how much I hated the bunker. We emerge into the woods, and my hands run through the leaves overhead. Some are just starting to turn. \"What day is it?\" I ask no one in particular. Boggs tells me September begins next week.\n September. That means Snow has had Peeta in his clutches for five, maybe six weeks. I examine a leaf on my palm and see I\u0027m shaking. I can\u0027t will myself to stop. I blame the coffee and try to focus on slowing my breathing, which is far too rapid for my pace.\n Debris begins to litter the forest floor. We come to our first crater, thirty yards wide and I can\u0027t tell how deep. Very. Boggs says anyone on the first ten levels would likely have been killed. We skirt the pit and continue on.\n \"Can you rebuild it?\" Gale asks.\n \"Not anytime soon. That one didn\u0027t get much. A few backup generators and a poultry farm,\" says Boggs. \"We\u0027ll just seal it off.\"\n The trees disappear as we enter the area inside the fence. The craters are ringed with a mixture of old and new rubble. Before the bombing, very little of the current 13 was aboveground. A few guard stations. The training area. About a foot of the top floor of our building - where Buttercup\u0027s window jutted out - with several feet of steel on top of it. Even that was never meant to withstand more than a superficial attack.\n \"How much of an edge did the boy\u0027s warning give you?\" asks Haymitch.\n \"About ten minutes before our own systems would\u0027ve detected the missiles,\" says Boggs.\n \"But it did help, right?\" I ask. I can\u0027t bear it if he says no.\n \"Absolutely,\" Boggs replies. \"Civilian evacuation was completed. Seconds count when you\u0027re under attack. Ten minutes meant lives saved.\"\n Prim, I think. And Gale. They were in the bunker only a couple of minutes before the first missile hit. Peeta might have saved them. Add their names to the list of things I can never stop owing him for.\n Cressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins of the old Justice Building, which is something of a joke since the Capitol\u0027s been using it as a backdrop for fake news broadcasts for years, to show that the district no longer existed. Now, with the recent attack, the Justice Building sits about ten yards away from the edge of a new crater.\n As we approach what used to be the grand entrance, Gale points out something and the whole party slows down. I don\u0027t know what the problem is at first and then I see the ground strewn with fresh pink and red roses. \"Don\u0027t touch them!\" I yell. \"They\u0027re for me!\"\n The sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose, and my heart begins to hammer against my chest. So I didn\u0027t imagine it. The rose on my dresser. Before me lies Snow\u0027s second delivery. Long-stemmed pink and red beauties, the very flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and I performed our post-victory interview. Flowers not meant for one, but for a pair of lovers.\n I explain to the others as best I can. Upon inspection, they appear to be harmless, if genetically enhanced, flowers. Two dozen roses. Slightly wilted. Most likely dropped after the last bombing. A crew in special suits collects them and carts them away. I feel certain they will find nothing extraordinary in them, though. Snow knows exactly what he\u0027s doing to me. It\u0027s like having Cinna beaten to a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube. Designed to unhinge me.\n Like then, I try to rally and fight back. But as Cressida gets Castor and Pollux in place, I feel my anxiety building. I\u0027m so tired, so wired, and so unable to keep my mind on anything but Peeta since I\u0027ve seen the roses. The coffee was a huge mistake. What I didn\u0027t need was a stimulant. My body visibly shakes and I can\u0027t seem to catch my breath. After days in the bunker, I\u0027m squinting no matter what direction I turn, and the light hurts. Even in the cool breeze, sweat trickles down my face.\n \"So, what exactly do you need from me again?\" I ask.\n \"Just a few quick lines that show you\u0027re alive and still fighting,\" says Cressida.\n \"Okay.\" I take my position and then I\u0027m staring into the red light. Staring. Staring. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027ve got nothing.\"\n Cressida walks up to me. \"You feeling okay?\" I nod. She pulls a small cloth from her pocket and blots my face. \"How about we do the old Q-and-A thing?\"\n \"Yeah. That would help, I think.\" I cross my arms to hide the shaking. Glance at Finnick, who gives me a thumbs-up. But he\u0027s looking pretty shaky himself.\n Cressida\u0027s back in position now. \"So, Katniss. You\u0027ve survived the Capitol bombing of Thirteen. How did it compare with what you experienced on the ground in Eight?\"\n \"We were so far underground this time, there was no real danger. Thirteen\u0027s alive and well and so am - \" My voice cuts off in a dry, squeaking sound.\n \"Try the line again,\" says Cressida. \"\u0027Thirteen\u0027s alive and well and so am I.\u0027\"\n I take a breath, trying to force air down into my diaphragm. \"Thirteen\u0027s alive and so - \" No, that\u0027s wrong.\n I swear I can still smell those roses.\n \"Katniss, just this one line and you\u0027re done today. I promise,\" says Cressida. \"\u0027Thirteen\u0027s alive and well and so am I.\u0027\"\n I swing my arms to loosen myself up. Place my fists on my hips. Then drop them to my sides. Saliva\u0027s filling my mouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit at the back of my throat. I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get the stupid line out and go hide in the woods and - that\u0027s when I start crying.\n It\u0027s impossible to be the Mockingjay. Impossible to complete even this one sentence. Because now I know that everything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta. Result in his torture. But not his death, no, nothing so merciful as that. Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.\n \"Cut,\" I hear Cressida say quietly.\n \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\" Plutarch says under his breath.\n \"She\u0027s figured out how Snow\u0027s using Peeta,\" says Finnick.\n There\u0027s something like a collective sigh of regret from the semicircle of people spread out before me. Because I know this now. Because there will never be a way for me to not know this again. Because, beyond the military disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails, I am broken.\n Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the end, the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch, because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for him and say something like his name and he\u0027s there, holding me and patting my back. \"It\u0027s okay. It\u0027ll be okay, sweetheart.\" He sits me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm around me while I sob.\n \"I can\u0027t do this anymore,\" I say.\n \"I know,\" he says.\n \"All I can think of is - what he\u0027s going to do to Peeta - because I\u0027m the Mockingjay!\" I get out.\n \"I know.\" Haymitch\u0027s arm tightens around me.\n \"Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they - doing to him?\" I\u0027m gasping for air between sobs, but I manage one last phrase. \"It\u0027s my fault!\" And then I cross some line into hysteria and there\u0027s a needle in my arm and the world slips away.\n It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because it\u0027s a full day before I come to. My sleep wasn\u0027t peaceful, though. I have the sense of emerging from a world of dark, haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the chair by my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I remember about Peeta and start to tremble again.\n Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. \"It\u0027s all right. We\u0027re going to try to get Peeta out.\"\n \"What?\" That makes no sense.\n \"Plutarch\u0027s sending in a rescue team. He has people on the inside. He thinks we can get Peeta back alive,\" he says.\n \"Why didn\u0027t we before?\" I say.\n \"Because it\u0027s costly. But everyone agrees this is the thing to do. It\u0027s the same choice we made in the arena. To do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can\u0027t lose the Mockingjay now. And you can\u0027t perform unless you know Snow can\u0027t take it out on Peeta.\" Haymitch offers me a cup. \"Here, drink something.\"\n I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. \"What do you mean, costly?\"\n He shrugs. \"Covers will be blown. People may die. But keep in mind that they\u0027re dying every day. And it\u0027s not just Peeta; we\u0027re getting Annie out for Finnick, too.\"\n \"Where is he?\" I ask.\n \"Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost it right after we knocked you out,\" says Haymitch. I smile a little, feel a bit less weak. \"Yeah, it was a really excellent shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange the mission to get Peeta. We\u0027re officially in reruns.\"\n \"Well, if Boggs is leading it, that\u0027s a plus,\" I say.\n \"Oh, he\u0027s on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he pretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air,\" says Haymitch. \"See? He\u0027s already demonstrated good judgment.\"\n Something\u0027s wrong. Haymitch\u0027s trying a little too hard to cheer me up. It\u0027s not really his style. \"So who else volunteered?\"\n \"I think there were seven altogether,\" he says evasively.\n I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. \"Who else, Haymitch?\" I insist.\n Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. \"You know who else, Katniss. You know who stepped up first.\"\n Of course I do.\n Gale. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-11.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) \n My name is Katniss Everdeen. \n Why am I not dead? \n I should be dead. \n Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.
