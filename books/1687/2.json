As we travel over District 12, I watch anxiously for signs of an attack, but nothing pursues us. After several minutes, when I hear an exchange between Plutarch and the pilot confirming that the airspace is clear, I begin to relax a little.\\n\\n Gale nods at the howls coming from my game bag. \"Now I know why you had to go back.\"\\n\\n \"If there was even a chance of his recovery.\" I dump the bag onto a seat, where the loathsome creature begins a low, deep-throated growl. \"Oh, shut up,\" I tell the bag as I sink into the cushioned window seat across from it.\\n\\n Gale sits next to me. \"Pretty bad down there?\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t be much worse,\" I answer. I look in his eyes and see my own grief reflected there. Our hands find each other, holding fast to a part of 12 that Snow has somehow failed to destroy. We sit in silence for the rest of the trip to 13, which only takes about forty-five minutes. A mere week\u0027s journey on foot. Bonnie and Twill, the District 8 refugees who I encountered in the woods last winter, weren\u0027t so far from their destination after all. They apparently didn\u0027t make it, though. When I asked about them in 13, no one seemed to know who I was talking about. Died in the woods, I guess.\\n\\n From the air, 13 looks about as cheerful as 12. The rubble isn\u0027t smoking, the way the Capitol shows it on television, but there\u0027s next to no life aboveground. In the seventy-five years since the Dark Days - when 13 was said to have been obliterated in the war between the Capitol and the districts - almost all new construction has been beneath the earth\u0027s surface. There was already a substantial underground facility here, developed over centuries to be either a clandestine refuge for government leaders in time of war or a last resort for humanity if life above became unlivable. Most important for the people of 13, it was the center of the Capitol\u0027s nuclear weapons development program. During the Dark Days, the rebels in 13 wrested control from the government forces, trained their nuclear missiles on the Capitol, and then struck a bargain: They would play dead in exchange for being left alone. The Capitol had another nuclear arsenal out west, but it couldn\u0027t attack 13 without certain retaliation. It was forced to accept 13\u0027s deal. The Capitol demolished the visible remains of the district and cut off all access from the outside. Perhaps the Capitol\u0027s leaders thought that, without help, 13 would die off on its own. It almost did a few times, but it always managed to pull through due to strict sharing of resources, strenuous discipline, and constant vigilance against any further attacks from the Capitol.\\n\\n Now the citizens live almost exclusively underground. You can go outside for exercise and sunlight but only at very specific times in your schedule. You can\u0027t miss your schedule. Every morning, you\u0027re supposed to stick your right arm in this contraption in the wall. It tattoos the smooth inside of your forearm with your schedule for the day in a sickly purple ink. 7:00 - Breakfast. 7:30 - Kitchen Duties. 8:30 - Education Center, Room 17. And so on. The ink is indelible until 22:00 - Bathing . That\u0027s when whatever keeps it water resistant breaks down and the whole schedule rinses away. The lights-out at 22:30 signals that everyone not on the night shift should be in bed.\\n\\n At first, when I was so ill in the hospital, I could forgo being imprinted. But once I moved into Compartment 307 with my mother and sister, I was expected to get with the program. Except for showing up for meals, though, I pretty much ignore the words on my arm. I just go back to our compartment or wander around 13 or fall asleep somewhere hidden. An abandoned air duct. Behind the water pipes in the laundry. There\u0027s a closet in the Education Center that\u0027s great because no one ever seems to need school supplies. They\u0027re so frugal with things here, waste is practically a criminal activity. Fortunately, the people of 12 have never been wasteful. But once I saw Fulvia Cardew crumple up a sheet of paper with just a couple of words written on it and you would\u0027ve thought she\u0027d murdered someone from the looks she got. Her face turned tomato red, making the silver flowers inlaid in her plump cheeks even more noticeable. The very portrait of excess. One of my few pleasures in 13 is watching the handful of pampered Capitol \"rebels\" squirming as they try to fit in.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be able to get away with my complete disregard for the clockwork precision of attendance required by my hosts. Right now, they leave me alone because I\u0027m classified as mentally disoriented - it says so right on my plastic medical bracelet - and everyone has to tolerate my ramblings. But that can\u0027t last forever. Neither can their patience with the Mockingjay issue.\\n\\n From the landing pad, Gale and I walk down a series of stairways to Compartment 307. We could take the elevator, only it reminds me too much of the one that lifted me into the arena. I\u0027m having a hard time adjusting to being underground so much. But after the surreal encounter with the rose, for the first time the descent makes me feel safer.\\n\\n I hesitate at the door marked 307 , anticipating the questions from my family. \"What am I going to tell them about Twelve?\" I ask Gale.\\n\\n \"I doubt they\u0027ll ask for details. They saw it burn. They\u0027ll mostly be worried about how you\u0027re handling it.\" Gale touches my cheek. \"Like I am.\"\\n\\n I press my face against his hand for a moment. \"I\u0027ll survive.\"\\n\\n Then I take a deep breath and open the door. My mother and sister are home for 18:00 - Reflection, a half hour of downtime before dinner. I see the concern on their faces as they try to gauge my emotional state. Before anyone can ask anything, I empty my game bag and it becomes 18:00 - Cat Adoration. Prim just sits on the floor weeping and rocking that awful Buttercup, who interrupts his purring only for an occasional hiss at me. He gives me a particularly smug look when she ties the blue ribbon around his neck.\\n\\n My mother hugs the wedding photo tightly against her chest and then places it, along with the book of plants, on our government-issued chest of drawers. I hang my father\u0027s jacket on the back of a chair. For a moment, the place almost seems like home. So I guess the trip to 12 wasn\u0027t a complete waste.\\n\\n We\u0027re heading down to the dining hall for 18:30 - Dinner when Gale\u0027s communicuff begins to beep. It looks like an oversized watch, but it receives print messages. Being granted a communicuff is a special privilege that\u0027s reserved for those important to the cause, a status Gale achieved by his rescue of the citizens of 12. \"They need the two of us in Command,\" he says.\\n\\n Trailing a few steps behind Gale, I try to collect myself before I\u0027m thrown into what\u0027s sure to be another relentless Mockingjay session. I linger in the doorway of Command, the high-tech meeting/war council room complete with computerized talking walls, electronic maps showing the troop movements in various districts, and a giant rectangular table with control panels I\u0027m not supposed to touch. No one notices me, though, because they\u0027re all gathered at a television screen at the far end of the room that airs the Capitol broadcast around the clock. I\u0027m thinking I might be able to slip away when Plutarch, whose ample frame has been blocking the television, catches sight of me and waves urgently for me to join them. I reluctantly move forward, trying to imagine how it could be of interest to me. It\u0027s always the same. War footage. Propaganda. Replaying the bombings of District 12. An ominous message from President Snow. So it\u0027s almost entertaining to see Caesar Flickerman, the eternal host of the Hunger Games, with his painted face and sparkly suit, preparing to give an interview. Until the camera pulls back and I see that his guest is Peeta.\\n\\n A sound escapes me. The same combination of gasp and groan that comes from being submerged in water, deprived of oxygen to the point of pain. I push people aside until I am right in front of him, my hand resting on the screen. I search his eyes for any sign of hurt, any reflection of the agony of torture. There is nothing. Peeta looks healthy to the point of robustness. His skin is glowing, flawless, in that full-body-polish way. His manner\u0027s composed, serious. I can\u0027t reconcile this image with the battered, bleeding boy who haunts my dreams.\\n\\n Caesar settles himself more comfortably in the chair across from Peeta and gives him a long look.\\n\\n \"So...Peeta...welcome back.\"\\n\\n Peeta smiles slightly. \"I bet you thought you\u0027d done your last interview with me, Caesar.\"\\n\\n \"I confess, I did,\" says Caesar. \"The night before the Quarter Quell...well, who ever thought we\u0027d see you again?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t part of my plan, that\u0027s for sure,\" says Peeta with a frown.\\n\\n Caesar leans in to him a little. \"I think it was clear to all of us what your plan was. To sacrifice yourself in the arena so that Katniss Everdeen and your child could survive.\"\\n\\n \"That was it. Clear and simple.\" Peeta\u0027s fingers trace the upholstered pattern on the arm of the chair.\\n\\n \"But other people had plans as well.\"\\n\\n Yes, other people had plans,I think. Has Peeta guessed, then, how the rebels used us as pawns? How my rescue was arranged from the beginning? And finally, how our mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, betrayed us both for a cause he pretended to have no interest in?\\n\\n In the silence that follows, I notice the lines that have formed between Peeta\u0027s eyebrows. He has guessed or he has been told. But the Capitol has not killed or even punished him. For right now, that exceeds my wildest hopes. I drink in his wholeness, the soundness of his body and mind. It runs through me like the morphling they give me in the hospital, dulling the pain of the last weeks.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell us about that last night in the arena?\" suggests Caesar. \"Help us sort a few things out.\"\\n\\n Peeta nods but takes his time speaking. \"That last night...to tell you about that last night...well, first of all, you have to imagine how it felt in the arena. It was like being an insect trapped under a bowl filled with steaming air. And all around you, jungle...green and alive and ticking. That giant clock ticking away your life. Every hour promising some new horror. You have to imagine that in the past two days, sixteen people have died - some of them defending you. At the rate things are going, the last eight will be dead by morning. Save one. The victor. And your plan is that it won\u0027t be you.\"\\n\\n My body breaks out in a sweat at the memory. My hand slides down the screen and hangs limply at my side. Peeta doesn\u0027t need a brush to paint images from the Games. He works just as well in words.\\n\\n \"Once you\u0027re in the arena, the rest of the world becomes very distant,\" he continues. \"All the people and things you loved or cared about almost cease to exist. The pink sky and the monsters in the jungle and the tributes who want your blood become your final reality, the only one that ever mattered. As bad as it makes you feel, you\u0027re going to have to do some killing, because in the arena, you only get one wish. And it\u0027s very costly.\"\\n\\n \"It costs your life,\" says Caesar.\\n\\n \"Oh, no. It costs a lot more than your life. To murder innocent people?\" says Peeta. \"It costs everything you are.\"\\n\\n \"Everything you are,\" repeats Caesar quietly.\\n\\n A hush has fallen over the room, and I can feel it spreading across Panem. A nation leaning in toward its screens. Because no one has ever talked about what it\u0027s really like in the arena before.\\n\\n Peeta goes on. \"So you hold on to your wish. And that last night, yes, my wish was to save Katniss. But even without knowing about the rebels, it didn\u0027t feel right. Everything was too complicated. I found myself regretting I hadn\u0027t run off with her earlier in the day, as she had suggested. But there was no getting out of it at that point.\"\\n\\n \"You were too caught up in Beetee\u0027s plan to electrify the salt lake,\" says Caesar.\\n\\n \"Too busy playing allies with the others. I should have never let them separate us!\" Peeta bursts out.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s when I lost her.\"\\n\\n \"When you stayed at the lightning tree, and she and Johanna Mason took the coil of wire down to the water,\" Caesar clarifies.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to!\" Peeta flushes in agitation. \"But I couldn\u0027t argue with Beetee without indicating we were about to break away from the alliance. When that wire was cut, everything just went insane. I can only remember bits and pieces. Trying to find her. Watching Brutus kill Chaff. Killing Brutus myself. I know she was calling my name. Then the lightning bolt hit the tree, and the force field around the arena...blew out.\"\\n\\n \"Katniss blew it out, Peeta,\" says Caesar. \"You\u0027ve seen the footage.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t know what she was doing. None of us could follow Beetee\u0027s plan. You can see her trying to figure out what to do with that wire,\" Peeta snaps back.\\n\\n \"All right. It just looks suspicious,\" says Caesar. \"As if she was part of the rebels\u0027 plan all along.\"\\n\\n Peeta\u0027s on his feet, leaning in to Caesar\u0027s face, hands locked on the arms of his interviewer\u0027s chair.\\n\\n \"Really? And was it part of her plan for Johanna to nearly kill her? For that electric shock to paralyze her? To trigger the bombing?\" He\u0027s yelling now. \"She didn\u0027t know, Caesar! Neither of us knew anything except that we were trying to keep each other alive!\"\\n\\n Caesar places his hand on Peeta\u0027s chest in a gesture that\u0027s both self-protective and conciliatory. \"Okay, Peeta, I believe you.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" Peeta withdraws from Caesar, pulling back his hands, running them through his hair, mussing his carefully styled blond curls. He slumps back in his chair, distraught.\\n\\n Caesar waits a moment, studying Peeta. \"What about your mentor, Haymitch Abernathy?\"\\n\\n Peeta\u0027s face hardens. \"I don\u0027t know what Haymitch knew.\"\\n\\n \"Could he have been part of the conspiracy?\" asks Caesar.\\n\\n \"He never mentioned it,\" says Peeta.\\n\\n Caesar presses on. \"What does your heart tell you?\"\\n\\n \"That I shouldn\u0027t have trusted him,\" says Peeta. \"That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n I haven\u0027t seen Haymitch since I attacked him on the hovercraft, leaving long claw marks down his face. I know it\u0027s been bad for him here. District 13 strictly forbids any production or consumption of intoxicating beverages, and even the rubbing alcohol in the hospital is kept under lock and key. Finally, Haymitch is being forced into sobriety, with no secret stashes or home-brewed concoctions to ease his transition. They\u0027ve got him in seclusion until he\u0027s dried out, as he\u0027s not deemed fit for public display. It must be excruciating, but I lost all my sympathy for Haymitch when I realized how he had deceived us. I hope he\u0027s watching the Capitol broadcast now, so he can see that Peeta has cast him off as well.\\n\\n Caesar pats Peeta\u0027s shoulder. \"We can stop now if you want.\"\\n\\n \"Was there more to discuss?\" says Peeta wryly.\\n\\n \"I was going to ask your thoughts on the war, but if you\u0027re too upset...\" begins Caesar.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m not too upset to answer that.\" Peeta takes a deep breath and then looks straight into the camera. \"I want everyone watching - whether you\u0027re on the Capitol or the rebel side - to stop for just a moment and think about what this war could mean. For human beings. We almost went extinct fighting one another before. Now our numbers are even fewer. Our conditions more tenuous. Is this really what we want to do? Kill ourselves off completely? In the hopes that - what? Some decent species will inherit the smoking remains of the earth?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really...I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m following...\" says Caesar.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t fight one another, Caesar,\" Peeta explains. \"There won\u0027t be enough of us left to keep going. If everybody doesn\u0027t lay down their weapons - and I mean, as invery soon - it\u0027s all over, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"So...you\u0027re calling for a cease-fire?\" Caesar asks.\\n\\n \"Yes. I\u0027m calling for a cease-fire,\" says Peeta tiredly. \"Now why don\u0027t we ask the guards to take me back to my quarters so I can build another hundred card houses?\"\\n\\n Caesar turns to the camera. \"All right. I think that wraps it up. So back to our regularly scheduled programming.\"\\n\\n Music plays them out, and then there\u0027s a woman reading a list of expected shortages in the Capitol - fresh fruit, solar batteries, soap. I watch her with uncharacteristic absorption, because I know everyone will be waiting for my reaction to the interview. But there\u0027s no way I can process it all so quickly - the joy of seeing Peeta alive and unharmed, his defense of my innocence in collaborating with the rebels, and his undeniable complicity with the Capitol now that he\u0027s called for a cease-fire. Oh, he made it sound as if he were condemning both sides in the war. But at this point, with only minor victories for the rebels, a cease-fire could only result in a return to our previous status. Or worse.\\n\\n Behind me, I can hear the accusations against Peeta building. The wordstraitor ,liar , andenemy bounce off the walls. Since I can neither join in the rebels\u0027 outrage nor counter it, I decide the best thing to do is clear out. As I reach the door, Coin\u0027s voice rises above the others. \"You have not been dismissed, Soldier Everdeen.\"\\n\\n One of Coin\u0027s men lays a hand on my arm. It\u0027s not an aggressive move, really, but after the arena, I react defensively to any unfamiliar touch. I jerk my arm free and take off running down the halls. Behind me, there\u0027s the sound of a scuffle, but I don\u0027t stop. My mind does a quick inventory of my odd little hiding places, and I wind up in the supply closet, curled up against a crate of chalk.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re alive,\" I whisper, pressing my palms against my cheeks, feeling the smile that\u0027s so wide it must look like a grimace. Peeta\u0027s alive. And a traitor. But at the moment, I don\u0027t care. Not what he says, or who he says it for, only that he is still capable of speech.\\n\\n After a while, the door opens and someone slips in. Gale slides down beside me, his nose trickling blood.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I got in Boggs\u0027s way,\" he answers with a shrug. I use my sleeve to wipe his nose. \"Watch it!\"\\n\\n I try to be gentler. Patting, not wiping. \"Which one is he?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you know. Coin\u0027s right-hand lackey. The one who tried to stop you.\" He pushes my hand away.\\n\\n \"Quit! You\u0027ll bleed me to death.\"\\n\\n The trickle has turned to a steady stream. I give up on the first-aid attempts. \"You fought with Boggs?\"\\n\\n \"No, just blocked the doorway when he tried to follow you. His elbow caught me in the nose,\" says Gale.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll probably punish you,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Already have.\" He holds up his wrist. I stare at it uncomprehendingly. \"Coin took back my communicuff.\"\\n\\n I bite my lip, trying to remain serious. But it seems so ridiculous. \"I\u0027m sorry, Soldier Gale Hawthorne.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be, Soldier Katniss Everdeen.\" He grins. \"I felt like a jerk walking around with it anyway.\" We both start laughing. \"I think it was quite a demotion.\"\\n\\n This is one of the few good things about 13. Getting Gale back. With the pressure of the Capitol\u0027s arranged marriage between Peeta and me gone, we\u0027ve managed to regain our friendship. He doesn\u0027t push it any further - try to kiss me or talk about love. Either I\u0027ve been too sick, or he\u0027s willing to give me space, or he knows it\u0027s just too cruel with Peeta in the hands of the Capitol. Whatever the case, I\u0027ve got someone to tell my secrets to again.\\n\\n \"Who are these people?\" I say.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re us. If we\u0027d had nukes instead of a few lumps of coal,\" he answers.\\n\\n \"I like to think Twelve wouldn\u0027t have abandoned the rest of the rebels back in the Dark Days,\" I say.\\n\\n \"We might have. If it was that, surrender, or start a nuclear war,\" says Gale. \"In a way, it\u0027s remarkable they survived at all.\"\\n\\n Maybe it\u0027s because I still have the ashes of my own district on my shoes, but for the first time, I give the people of 13 something I have withheld from them: credit. For staying alive against all odds. Their early years must have been terrible, huddled in the chambers beneath the ground after their city was bombed to dust. Population decimated, no possible ally to turn to for aid. Over the past seventy-five years, they\u0027ve learned to be self-sufficient, turned their citizens into an army, and built a new society with no help from anyone. They would be even more powerful if that pox epidemic hadn\u0027t flattened their birthrate and made them so desperate for a new gene pool and breeders. Maybe they are militaristic, overly programmed, and somewhat lacking in a sense of humor. They\u0027re here. And willing to take on the Capitol.\\n\\n \"Still, it took them long enough to show up,\" I say.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t simple. They had to build up a rebel base in the Capitol, get some sort of underground organized in the districts,\" he says. \"Then they needed someone to set the whole thing in motion. They needed you.\"\\n\\n \"They needed Peeta, too, but they seem to have forgotten that,\" I say.\\n\\n Gale\u0027s expression darkens. \"Peeta might have done a lot of damage tonight. Most of the rebels will dismiss what he said immediately, of course. But there are districts where the resistance is shakier. The cease-fire\u0027s clearly President Snow\u0027s idea. But it seems so reasonable coming out of Peeta\u0027s mouth.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m afraid of Gale\u0027s answer, but I ask anyway. \"Why do you think he said it?\"\\n\\n \"He might have been tortured. Or persuaded. My guess is he made some kind of deal to protect you. He\u0027d put forth the idea of the cease-fire if Snow let him present you as a confused pregnant girl who had no idea what was going on when she was taken prisoner by the rebels. This way, if the districts lose, there\u0027s still a chance of leniency for you. If you play it right.\" I must still look perplexed because Gale delivers the next line very slowly. \"Katniss...he\u0027s still trying to keep you alive.\"\\n\\n To keep me alive?And then I understand. The Games are still on. We have left the arena, but since Peeta and I weren\u0027t killed, his last wish to preserve my life still stands. His idea is to have me lie low, remain safe and imprisoned, while the war plays out. Then neither side will really have cause to kill me. And Peeta? If the rebels win, it will be disastrous for him. If the Capitol wins, who knows? Maybe we\u0027ll both be allowed to live - if I play it right - to watch the Games go on....\\n\\n Images flash through my mind: the spear piercing Rue\u0027s body in the arena, Gale hanging senseless from the whipping post, the corpse-littered wasteland of my home. And for what? For what? As my blood turns hot, I remember other things. My first glimpse of an uprising in District 8. The victors locked hand in hand the night before the Quarter Quell. And how it was no accident, my shooting that arrow into the force field in the arena. How badly I wanted it to lodge deep in the heart of my enemy.\\n\\n I spring up, upsetting a box of a hundred pencils, sending them scattering around the floor.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Gale asks.\\n\\n \"There can\u0027t be a cease-fire.\" I lean down, fumbling as I shove the sticks of dark gray graphite back into the box. \"We can\u0027t go back.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Gale sweeps up a handful of pencils and taps them on the floor into perfect alignment.\\n\\n \"Whatever reason Peeta had for saying those things, he\u0027s wrong.\" The stupid sticks won\u0027t go in the box and I snap several in my frustration.\\n\\n \"I know. Give it here. You\u0027re breaking them to bits.\" He pulls the box from my hands and refills it with swift, concise motions.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t know what they did to Twelve. If he could\u0027ve seen what was on the ground\" - I start.\\n\\n \"Katniss, I\u0027m not arguing. If I could hit a button and kill every living soul working for the Capitol, I would do it. Without hesitation.\" He slides the last pencil into the box and flips the lid closed. \"The question is, what are you going to do?\"\\n\\n It turns out the question that\u0027s been eating away at me has only ever had one possible answer. But it took Peeta\u0027s ploy for me to recognize it.\\n\\n What am I going to do?\\n\\n I take a deep breath. My arms rise slightly - as if recalling the black-and-white wings Cinna gave me - then come to rest at my sides.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to be the Mockingjay.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-2.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) \\n My name is Katniss Everdeen. \\n Why am I not dead? \\n I should be dead. \\n Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.
