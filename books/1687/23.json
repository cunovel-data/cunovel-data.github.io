Perhaps her cry was meant for a nearby neighbor, or was simply an expression of fear. At any rate, there\u0027s no one else to hear her.\\n\\n This apartment would be a classy place to hole up in for a while, but that\u0027s a luxury we can\u0027t afford. \"How long do you think we have before they figure out some of us could\u0027ve survived?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I think they could be here anytime,\" Gale answers. \"They knew we were heading for the streets. Probably the explosion will throw them for a few minutes, then they\u0027ll start looking for our exit point.\"\\n\\n I go to a window that overlooks the street, and when I peek through the blinds, I\u0027m not faced with Peacekeepers but with a bundled crowd of people going about their business. During our underground journey, we have left the evacuated zones far behind and surfaced in a busy section of the Capitol. This crowd offers our only chance of escape. I don\u0027t have a Holo, but I have Cressida. She joins me at the window, confirms she knows our location, and gives me the good news that we aren\u0027t many blocks from the president\u0027s mansion.\\n\\n One glance at my companions tells me this is no time for a stealth attack on Snow. Gale\u0027s still losing blood from the neck wound, which we haven\u0027t even cleaned. Peeta\u0027s sitting on a velvet sofa with his teeth clamped down on a pillow, either fighting off madness or containing a scream. Pollux weeps against the mantel of an ornate fireplace. Cressida stands determinedly at my side, but she\u0027s so pale her lips are bloodless. I\u0027m running on hate. When the energy for that ebbs, I\u0027ll be worthless.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s check her closets,\" I say.\\n\\n In one bedroom we find hundreds of the woman\u0027s outfits, coats, pairs of shoes, a rainbow of wigs, enough makeup to paint a house. In a bedroom across the hall, there\u0027s a similar selection for men. Perhaps they belong to her husband. Perhaps to a lover who had the good luck to be out this morning. I call the others to dress. At the sight of Peeta\u0027s bloody wrists, I dig in my pocket for the handcuff key, but he jerks away from me.\\n\\n \"No,\" he says. \"Don\u0027t. They help hold me together.\"\\n\\n \"You might need your hands,\" says Gale.\\n\\n \"When I feel myself slipping, I dig my wrists into them, and the pain helps me focus,\" says Peeta. I let them be.\\n\\n Fortunately, it\u0027s cold out, so we can conceal most of our uniforms and weapons under flowing coats and cloaks. We hang our boots around our necks by their laces and hide them, pull on silly shoes to replace them. The real challenge, of course, is our faces. Cressida and Pollux run the risk of being recognized by acquaintances, Gale could be familiar from the propos and news, and Peeta and I are known by every citizen of Panem. We hastily help one another apply thick layers of makeup, pull on wigs and sunglasses. Cressida wraps scarves over Peeta\u0027s and my mouths and noses.\\n\\n I can feel the clock ticking away, but stop for just a few moments to stuff pockets with food and first-aid supplies. \"Stay together,\" I say at the front door. Then we march right into the street. Snow flurries have begun to fall. Agitated people swirl around us, speaking of rebels and hunger and me in their affected Capitol accents. We cross the street, pass a few more apartments. Just as we turn the corner, three dozen Peacekeepers sweep past us. We hop out of their way, as the real citizens do, wait until the crowd returns to its normal flow, and keep moving. \"Cressida,\" I whisper. \"Can you think of anywhere?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying,\" she says.\\n\\n We cover another block, and the sirens begin. Through an apartment window, I see an emergency report and pictures of our faces flashing. They haven\u0027t identified who in our party died yet, because I see Castor and Finnick among the photos. Soon every passerby will be as dangerous as a Peacekeeper. \"Cressida?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s one place. It\u0027s not ideal. But we can try it,\" she says. We follow her a few more blocks and turn through a gate into what looks like a private residence. It\u0027s some kind of shortcut, though, because after walking through a manicured garden, we come out of another gate onto a small back street that connects two main avenues. There are a few poky stores - one that buys used goods, another that sells fake jewelry. Only a couple of people are around, and they pay no attention to us. Cressida begins to babble in a high-pitched voice about fur undergarments, how essential they are during the cold months. \"Wait until you see the prices! Believe me, it\u0027s half what you pay on the avenues!\"\\n\\n We stop before a grimy storefront filled with mannequins in furry underwear. The place doesn\u0027t even look open, but Cressida pushes through the front door, setting off a dissonant chiming. Inside the dim, narrow shop lined with racks of merchandise, the smell of pelts fills my nose. Business must be slow, since we\u0027re the only customers. Cressida heads straight for a hunched figure sitting in the back. I follow, trailing my fingers through the soft garments as we go.\\n\\n Behind a counter sits the strangest person I\u0027ve ever seen. She\u0027s an extreme example of surgical enhancement gone wrong, for surely not even in the Capitol could they find this face attractive. The skin has been pulled back tightly and tattooed with black and gold stripes. The nose has been flattened until it barely exists. I\u0027ve seen cat whiskers on people in the Capitol before, but none so long. The result is a grotesque, semi-feline mask, which now squints at us distrustfully.\\n\\n Cressida takes off her wig, revealing her vines. \"Tigris,\" she says. \"We need help.\"\\n\\n Tigris. Deep in my brain, the name rings a bell. She was a fixture - a younger, less disturbing version of herself - in the earliest Hunger Games I can remember. A stylist, I think. I don\u0027t remember for which district. Not 12. Then she must have had one operation too many and crossed the line into repellence.\\n\\n So this is where stylists go when they\u0027ve outlived their use. To sad theme underwear shops where they wait for death. Out of the public eye.\\n\\n I stare at her face, wondering if her parents actually named her Tigris, inspiring her mutilation, or if she chose the style and changed her name to match her stripes.\\n\\n \"Plutarch said you could be trusted,\" adds Cressida.\\n\\n Great, she\u0027s one of Plutarch\u0027s people. So if her first move isn\u0027t to turn us in to the Capitol, it will be to notify Plutarch, and by extension Coin, of our whereabouts. No, Tigris\u0027s shop is not ideal, but it\u0027s all we have at the moment. If she\u0027ll even help us. She\u0027s peering between an old television on her counter and us, as if trying to place us. To help her, I pull down my scarf, remove my wig, and step closer so that the light of the screen falls on my face.\\n\\n Tigris gives a low growl, not unlike one Buttercup might greet me with. She slinks down off her stool and disappears behind a rack of fur-lined leggings. There\u0027s a sound of sliding, and then her hand emerges and waves us forward. Cressida looks at me, as if to askAre you sure? But what choice do we have? Returning to the streets under these conditions guarantees our capture or death. I push around the furs and find Tigris has slid back a panel at the base of the wall. Behind it seems to be the top of a steep stone stairway. She gestures for me to enter.\\n\\n Everything about the situation screamstrap . I have a moment of panic and find myself turning to Tigris, searching those tawny eyes. Why is she doing this? She\u0027s no Cinna, someone willing to sacrifice herself for others. This woman was the embodiment of Capitol shallowness. She was one of the stars of the Hunger Games until...until she wasn\u0027t. So is that it, then? Bitterness? Hatred? Revenge? Actually, I\u0027m comforted by the idea. A need for revenge can burn long and hot. Especially if every glance in a mirror reinforces it.\\n\\n \"Did Snow ban you from the Games?\" I ask. She just stares back at me. Somewhere her tiger tail flicks with displeasure. \"Because I\u0027m going to kill him, you know.\" Her mouth spreads into what I take for a smile. Reassured that this isn\u0027t complete madness, I crawl through the space.\\n\\n About halfway down the steps, my face runs into a hanging chain and I pull it, illuminating the hideout with a flickering fluorescent bulb. It\u0027s a small cellar with no doors or windows. Shallow and wide. Probably just a strip between two real basements. A place whose existence could go unnoticed unless you had a very keen eye for dimensions. It\u0027s cold and dank, with piles of pelts that I\u0027m guessing haven\u0027t seen the light of day in years. Unless Tigris gives us up, I don\u0027t believe anyone will find us here. By the time I reach the concrete floor, my companions are on the steps. The panel slides back in place. I hear the underwear rack being adjusted on squeaky wheels. Tigris padding back to her stool. We have been swallowed up by her store.\\n\\n Just in time, too, because Gale looks on the verge of collapse. We make a bed of pelts, strip off his layers of weapons, and help him onto his back. At the end of the cellar, there\u0027s a faucet about a foot from the floor with a drain under it. I turn the tap and, after much sputtering and a lot of rust, clear water begins to flow. We clean Gale\u0027s neck wound and I realize bandages won\u0027t be enough. He\u0027s going to need a few stitches. There\u0027s a needle and sterile thread in the first-aid supplies, but what we lack is a healer. It crosses my mind to enlist Tigris. As a stylist, she must know how to work a needle. But that would leave no one manning the shop, and she\u0027s doing enough already. I accept that I\u0027m probably the most qualified for the job, grit my teeth, and put in a row of jagged sutures. It\u0027s not pretty but it\u0027s functional. I smear it with medicine and wrap it up. Give him some painkillers. \"You can rest now. It\u0027s safe here,\" I tell him. He goes out like a light.\\n\\n While Cressida and Pollux make fur nests for each of us, I attend to Peeta\u0027s wrists. Gently rinsing away the blood, putting on an antiseptic, and bandaging them beneath the cuffs. \"You\u0027ve got to keep them clean, otherwise the infection could spread and - \"\\n\\n \"I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,\" says Peeta. \"Even if my mother isn\u0027t a healer.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m jolted back in time, to another wound, another set of bandages. \"You said that same thing to me in the first Hunger Games. Real or not real?\"\\n\\n \"Real,\" he says. \"And you risked your life getting the medicine that saved me?\"\\n\\n \"Real.\" I shrug. \"You were the reason I was alive to do it.\"\\n\\n \"Was I?\" The comment throws him into confusion. Some shiny memory must be fighting for his attention, because his body tenses and his newly bandaged wrists strain against the metal cuffs. Then all the energy saps from his body. \"I\u0027m so tired, Katniss.\"\\n\\n \"Go to sleep,\" I say. He won\u0027t until I\u0027ve rearranged his handcuffs and shackled him to one of the stair supports. It can\u0027t be comfortable, lying there with his arms above his head. But in a few minutes, he drifts off, too.\\n\\n Cressida and Pollux have made beds for us, arranged our food and medical supplies, and now ask what I want to do about setting up a guard. I look at Gale\u0027s pallor, Peeta\u0027s restraints. Pollux hasn\u0027t slept for days, and Cressida and I only napped for a few hours. If a troop of Peacekeepers were to come through that door, we\u0027d be trapped like rats. We are completely at the mercy of a decrepit tiger-woman with what I can only hope is an all-consuming passion for Snow\u0027s death.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t honestly think there\u0027s any point in setting up a guard. Let\u0027s just try to get some sleep,\" I say. They nod numbly, and we all burrow into our pelts. The fire inside me has flickered out, and with it my strength. I surrender to the soft, musty fur and oblivion.\\n\\n I have only one dream I remember. A long and wearying thing in which I\u0027m trying to get to District 12. The home I\u0027m seeking is intact, the people alive. Effie Trinket, conspicuous in a bright pink wig and tailored outfit, travels with me. I keep trying to ditch her in places, but she inexplicably reappears at my side, insisting that as my escort she\u0027s responsible for my staying on schedule. Only the schedule is constantly shifting, derailed by our lack of a stamp from an official or delayed when Effie breaks one of her high heels. We camp for days on a bench in a gray station in District 7, awaiting a train that never comes. When I wake, somehow I feel even more drained by this than my usual nighttime forays into blood and terror.\\n\\n Cressida, the only person awake, tells me it\u0027s late afternoon. I eat a can of beef stew and wash it down with a lot of water. Then I lean against the cellar wall, retracing the events of the last day. Moving death by death. Counting them up on my fingers. One, two - Mitchell and Boggs lost on the block. Three - Messalla melted by the pod. Four, five - Leeg 1 and Jackson sacrificing themselves at the Meat Grinder. Six, seven, eight - Castor, Homes, and Finnick being decapitated by the rose-scented lizard mutts. Eight dead in twenty-four hours. I know it happened, and yet it doesn\u0027t seem real. Surely, Castor is asleep under that pile of furs, Finnick will come bounding down the steps in a minute, Boggs will tell me his plan for our escape.\\n\\n To believe them dead is to accept I killed them. Okay, maybe not Mitchell and Boggs - they died on an actual assignment. But the others lost their lives defending me on a mission I fabricated. My plot to assassinate Snow seems so stupid now. So stupid as I sit shivering here in this cellar, tallying up our losses, fingering the tassels on the silver knee-high boots I stole from the woman\u0027s home. Oh, yeah - I forgot about that. I killed her, too. I\u0027m taking out unarmed citizens now.\\n\\n I think it\u0027s time I give myself up.\\n\\n When everyone finally awakens, I confess. How I lied about the mission, how I jeopardized everyone in pursuit of revenge. There\u0027s a long silence after I finish. Then Gale says, \"Katniss, we all knew you were lying about Coin sending you to assassinate Snow.\"\\n\\n \"You knew, maybe. The soldiers from Thirteen didn\u0027t,\" I reply.\\n\\n \"Do you really think Jackson believed you had orders from Coin?\" Cressida asks. \"Of course she didn\u0027t. But she trusted Boggs, and he\u0027d clearly wanted you to go on.\"\\n\\n \"I never even told Boggs what I planned to do,\" I say.\\n\\n \"You told everyone in Command!\" Gale says. \"It was one of your conditions for being the Mockingjay. \u0027I kill Snow.\u0027\"\\n\\n Those seem like two disconnected things. Negotiating with Coin for the privilege of executing Snow after the war and this unauthorized flight through the Capitol. \"But not like this,\" I say. \"It\u0027s been a complete disaster.\"\\n\\n \"I think it would be considered a highly successful mission,\" says Gale. \"We\u0027ve infiltrated the enemy camp, showing that the Capitol\u0027s defenses can be breached. We\u0027ve managed to get footage of ourselves all over the Capitol\u0027s news. We\u0027ve thrown the whole city into chaos trying to find us.\"\\n\\n \"Trust me, Plutarch\u0027s thrilled,\" Cressida adds.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because Plutarch doesn\u0027t care who dies,\" I say. \"Not as long as his Games are a success.\"\\n\\n Cressida and Gale go round and round trying to convince me. Pollux nods at their words to back them up. Only Peeta doesn\u0027t offer an opinion.\\n\\n \"What do you think, Peeta?\" I finally ask him.\\n\\n \"I think...you still have no idea. The effect you can have.\" He slides his cuffs up the support and pushes himself to a sitting position. \"None of the people we lost were idiots. They knew what they were doing. They followed you because they believed you really could kill Snow.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know why his voice reaches me when no one else\u0027s can. But if he\u0027s right, and I think he is, I owe the others a debt that can only be repaid in one way. I pull my paper map from a pocket in my uniform and spread it out on the floor with new resolve. \"Where are we, Cressida?\"\\n\\n Tigris\u0027s shop sits about five blocks from the City Circle and Snow\u0027s mansion. We\u0027re in easy walking distance through a zone in which the pods are deactivated for the residents\u0027 safety. We have disguises that, perhaps with some embellishments from Tigris\u0027s furry stock, could get us safely there. But then what? The mansion\u0027s sure to be heavily guarded, under round-the-clock camera surveillance, and laced with pods that could become live at the flick of a switch.\\n\\n \"What we need is to get him out in the open,\" Gale says to me. \"Then one of us could pick him off.\"\\n\\n \"Does he ever appear in public anymore?\" asks Peeta.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" says Cressida. \"At least in all the recent speeches I\u0027ve seen, he\u0027s been in the mansion. Even before the rebels got here. I imagine he became more vigilant after Finnick aired his crimes.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s right. It\u0027s not just the Tigrises of the Capitol who hate Snow now, but a web of people who know what he did to their friends and families. It would have to be something bordering on miraculous to lure him out. Something like...\\n\\n \"I bet he\u0027d come out for me,\" I say. \"If I were captured. He\u0027d want that as public as possible. He\u0027d want my execution on his front steps.\" I let this sink in. \"Then Gale could shoot him from the audience.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Peeta shakes his head. \"There are too many alternative endings to that plan. Snow might decide to keep you and torture information out of you. Or have you executed publicly without being present. Or kill you inside the mansion and display your body out front.\"\\n\\n \"Gale?\" I say.\\n\\n \"It seems like an extreme solution to jump to immediately,\" he says. \"Maybe if all else fails. Let\u0027s keep thinking.\"\\n\\n In the quiet that follows, we hear Tigris\u0027s soft footfall overhead. It must be closing time. She\u0027s locking up, fastening the shutters maybe. A few minutes later, the panel at the top of the stairs slides open.\\n\\n \"Come up,\" says a gravelly voice. \"I have some food for you.\" It\u0027s the first time she\u0027s talked since we arrived. Whether it\u0027s natural or from years of practice, I don\u0027t know, but there\u0027s something in her manner of speaking that suggests a cat\u0027s purr.\\n\\n As we climb the stairs, Cressida asks, \"Did you contact Plutarch, Tigris?\"\\n\\n \"No way to.\" Tigris shrugs. \"He\u0027ll figure out you\u0027re in a safe house. Don\u0027t worry.\"\\n\\n Worry? I feel immensely relieved by the news that I won\u0027t be given - and have to ignore - direct orders from 13. Or make up some viable defense for the decisions I\u0027ve made over the last couple of days.\\n\\n In the shop, the counter holds some stale hunks of bread, a wedge of moldy cheese, and half a bottle of mustard. It reminds me that not everyone in the Capitol has full stomachs these days. I feel obliged to tell Tigris about our remaining food supplies, but she waves my objections away. \"I eat next to nothing,\" she says. \"And then, only raw meat.\" This seems a little too in character, but I don\u0027t question it. I just scrape the mold off the cheese and divide up the food among the rest of us.\\n\\n While we eat, we watch the latest Capitol news coverage. The government has the rebel survivors narrowed down to the five of us. Huge bounties are offered for information leading to our capture. They emphasize how dangerous we are. Show us exchanging gunfire with the Peacekeepers, although not the mutts ripping off their heads. Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we left her, with my arrow still in her heart. Someone has redone her makeup for the cameras.\\n\\n The rebels let the Capitol broadcast run on uninterrupted. \"Have the rebels made a statement today?\" I ask Tigris. She shakes her head. \"I doubt Coin knows what to do with me now that I\u0027m still alive.\"\\n\\n Tigris gives a throaty cackle. \"No one knows what to do with you, girlie.\" Then she makes me take a pair of the fur leggings even though I can\u0027t pay her for them. It\u0027s the kind of gift you have to accept. And anyway, it\u0027s cold in that cellar.\\n\\n Downstairs after supper, we continue to rack our brains for a plan. Nothing good comes up, but we do agree that we can no longer go out as a group of five and that we should try to infiltrate the president\u0027s mansion before I turn myself into bait. I consent to that second point to avoid further argument. If I do decide to give myself up, it won\u0027t require anyone else\u0027s permission or participation.\\n\\n We change bandages, handcuff Peeta back to his support, and settle down to sleep. A few hours later, I slip back into consciousness and become aware of a quiet conversation. Peeta and Gale. I can\u0027t stop myself from eavesdropping.\\n\\n \"Thanks for the water,\" Peeta says.\\n\\n \"No problem,\" Gale replies. \"I wake up ten times a night anyway.\"\\n\\n \"To make sure Katniss is still here?\" asks Peeta.\\n\\n \"Something like that,\" Gale admits.\\n\\n There\u0027s a long pause before Peeta speaks again. \"That was funny, what Tigris said. About no one knowing what to do with her.\"\\n\\n \"Well,we never have,\" Gale says.\\n\\n They both laugh. It\u0027s so strange to hear them talking like this. Almost like friends. Which they\u0027re not. Never have been. Although they\u0027re not exactly enemies.\\n\\n \"She loves you, you know,\" says Peeta. \"She as good as told me after they whipped you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t believe it,\" Gale answers. \"The way she kissed you in the Quarter Quell...well, she never kissed me like that.\"\\n\\n \"It was just part of the show,\" Peeta tells him, although there\u0027s an edge of doubt in his voice.\\n\\n \"No, you won her over. Gave up everything for her. Maybe that\u0027s the only way to convince her you love her.\" There\u0027s a long pause. \"I should have volunteered to take your place in the first Games. Protected her then.\"\\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t,\" says Peeta. \"She\u0027d never have forgiven you. You had to take care of her family. They matter more to her than her life.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it won\u0027t be an issue much longer. I think it\u0027s unlikely all three of us will be alive at the end of the war. And if we are, I guess it\u0027s Katniss\u0027s problem. Who to choose.\" Gale yawns. \"We should get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" I hear Peeta\u0027s handcuffs slide down the support as he settles in. \"I wonder how she\u0027ll make up her mind.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that I do know.\" I can just catch Gale\u0027s last words through the layer of fur. \"Katniss will pick whoever she thinks she can\u0027t survive without.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-23.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) \\n My name is Katniss Everdeen. \\n Why am I not dead? \\n I should be dead. \\n Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.
