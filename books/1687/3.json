{"id":64023,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"3 Buttercup\u0027s eyes reflect the faint glow of the safety light over the door as he lies in the crook of Prim\u0027s arm, back on the job, protecting her from the night. She\u0027s snuggled close to my mother. Asleep, they look just as they did the morning of the reaping that landed me in my first Games. I have a bed to myself because I\u0027m recuperating and because no one can sleep with me anyway, what with the nightmares and the thrashing around. After tossing and turning for hours, I finally accept that it will be a wakeful night. Under Buttercup\u0027s watchful eye, I tiptoe across the cold tiled floor to the dresser. The middle drawer contains my government-issued clothes. Everyone wears the same gray pants and shirt, the shirt tucked in at the waist. Underneath the clothes, I keep the few items I had on me when I was lifted from the arena. My mockingjay pin. Peeta\u0027s token, the gold locket with photos of my mother and Prim and Gale inside. A silver parachute that holds a spile for tapping trees, and the pearl Peeta gave me a few hours before I blew out the force field. District 13 confiscated my tube of skin ointment for use in the hospital, and my bow and arrows because only guards have clearance to carry weapons. They\u0027re in safekeeping in the armory. I feel around for the parachute and slide my fingers inside until they close around the pearl. I sit back on my bed cross-legged and find myself rubbing the smooth iridescent surface of the pearl back and forth against my lips. For some reason, it\u0027s soothing. A cool kiss from the giver himself. \"Katniss?\" Prim whispers. She\u0027s awake, peering at me through the darkness. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Nothing. Just a bad dream. Go back to sleep.\" It\u0027s automatic. Shutting Prim and my mother out of things to shield them. Careful not to rouse my mother, Prim eases herself from the bed, scoops up Buttercup, and sits beside me. She touches the hand that has curled around the pearl. \"You\u0027re cold.\" Taking a spare blanket from the foot of the bed, she wraps it around all three of us, enveloping me in her warmth and Buttercup\u0027s furry heat as well. \"You could tell me, you know. I\u0027m good at keeping secrets. Even from Mother.\" She\u0027s really gone, then. The little girl with the back of her shirt sticking out like a duck tail, the one who needed help reaching the dishes, and who begged to see the frosted cakes in the bakery window. Time and tragedy have forced her to grow too quickly, at least for my taste, into a young woman who stitches bleeding wounds and knows our mother can hear only so much. \"Tomorrow morning, I\u0027m going to agree to be the Mockingjay,\" I tell her. \"Because you want to or because you feel forced into it?\" she asks. I laugh a little. \"Both, I guess. No, I want to. I have to, if it will help the rebels defeat Snow.\" I squeeze the pearl more tightly in my fist. \"It\u0027s just...Peeta. I\u0027m afraid if we do win, the rebels will execute him as a traitor.\" Prim thinks this over. \"Katniss, I don\u0027t think you understand how important you are to the cause. Important people usually get what they want. If you want to keep Peeta safe from the rebels, you can.\" I guess I\u0027m important. They went to a lot of trouble to rescue me. They took me to 12. \"You mean...I could demand that they give Peeta immunity? And they\u0027d have to agree to it?\" \"I think you could demand almost anything and they\u0027d have to agree to it.\" Prim wrinkles her brow. \"Only how do you know they\u0027ll keep their word?\" I remember all of the lies Haymitch told Peeta and me to get us to do what he wanted. What\u0027s to keep the rebels from reneging on the deal? A verbal promise behind closed doors, even a statement written on paper - these could easily evaporate after the war. Their existence or validity denied. Any witnesses in Command will be worthless. In fact, they\u0027d probably be the ones writing out Peeta\u0027s death warrant. I\u0027ll need a much larger pool of witnesses. I\u0027ll need everyone I can get. \"It will have to be public,\" I say. Buttercup gives a flick of his tail that I take as agreement. \"I\u0027ll make Coin announce it in front of the entire population of Thirteen.\" Prim smiles. \"Oh, that\u0027s good. It\u0027s not a guarantee, but it will be much harder for them to back out of their promise.\" I feel the kind of relief that follows an actual solution. \"I should wake you up more often, little duck.\" \"I wish you would,\" says Prim. She gives me a kiss. \"Try and sleep now, all right?\" And I do. In the morning, I see that 7:00 - Breakfast is directly followed by 7:30 - Command , which is fine since I may as well start the ball rolling. At the dining hall, I flash my schedule, which includes some kind of ID number, in front of a sensor. As I slide my tray along the metal shelf before the vats of food, I see breakfast is its usual dependable self - a bowl of hot grain, a cup of milk, and a small scoop of fruit or vegetables. Today, mashed turnips. All of it comes from 13\u0027s underground farms. I sit at the table assigned to the Everdeens and the Hawthornes and some other refugees, and shovel my food down, wishing for seconds, but there are never seconds here. They have nutrition down to a science. You leave with enough calories to take you to the next meal, no more, no less. Serving size is based on your age, height, body type, health, and amount of physical labor required by your schedule. The people from 12 are already getting slightly larger portions than the natives of 13 in an effort to bring us up to weight. I guess bony soldiers tire too quickly. It\u0027s working, though. In just a month, we\u0027re starting to look healthier, particularly the kids. Gale sets his tray beside me and I try not to stare at his turnips too pathetically, because I really want more, and he\u0027s already too quick to slip me his food. Even though I turn my attention to neatly folding my napkin, a spoonful of turnips slops into my bowl. \"You\u0027ve got to stop that,\" I say. But since I\u0027m already scooping up the stuff, it\u0027s not too convincing. \"Really. It\u0027s probably illegal or something.\" They have very strict rules about food. For instance, if you don\u0027t finish something and want to save it for later, you can\u0027t take it from the dining hall. Apparently, in the early days, there was some incident of food hoarding. For a couple of people like Gale and me, who\u0027ve been in charge of our families\u0027 food supply for years, it doesn\u0027t sit well. We know how to be hungry, but not how to be told how to handle what provisions we have. In some ways, District 13 is even more controlling than the Capitol. \"What can they do? They\u0027ve already got my communicuff,\" says Gale. As I scrape my bowl clean, I have an inspiration. \"Hey, maybe I should make that a condition of being the Mockingjay.\" \"That I can feed you turnips?\" he says. \"No, that we can hunt.\" That gets his attention. \"We\u0027d have to give everything to the kitchen. But still, we could...\" I don\u0027t have to finish because he knows. We could be aboveground. Out in the woods. We could be ourselves again. \"Do it,\" he says. \"Now\u0027s the time. You could ask for the moon and they\u0027d have to find some way to get it.\" He doesn\u0027t know that I\u0027m already asking for the moon by demanding they spare Peeta\u0027s life. Before I can decide whether or not to tell him, a bell signals the end of our eating shift. The thought of facing Coin alone makes me nervous. \"What are you scheduled for?\" Gale checks his arm. \"Nuclear History class. Where, by the way, your absence has been noted.\" \"I have to go to Command. Come with me?\" I ask. \"All right. But they might throw me out after yesterday.\" As we go to drop off our trays, he says, \"You know, you better put Buttercup on your list of demands, too. I don\u0027t think the concept of useless pets is well known here.\" \"Oh, they\u0027ll find him a job. Tattoo it on his paw every morning,\" I say. But I make a mental note to include him for Prim\u0027s sake. By the time we get to Command, Coin, Plutarch, and all their people have already assembled. The sight of Gale raises some eyebrows, but no one throws him out. My mental notes have become too jumbled, so I ask for a piece of paper and a pencil right off. My apparent interest in the proceedings - the first I\u0027ve shown since I\u0027ve been here - takes them by surprise. Several looks are exchanged. Probably they had some extra-special lecture planned for me. But instead, Coin personally hands me the supplies, and everyone waits in silence while I sit at the table and scrawl out my list.Buttercup. Hunting. Peeta\u0027s immunity. Announced in public. This is it. Probably my only chance to bargain.Think. What else do you want? I feel him, standing at my shoulder.Gale , I add to the list. I don\u0027t think I can do this without him. The headache\u0027s coming on and my thoughts begin to tangle. I shut my eyes and start to recite silently. My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12. I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The Capitol hates me. Peeta was taken prisoner. He is alive. He is a traitor but alive. I have to keep him alive.... The list. It still seems too small. I should try to think bigger, beyond our current situation where I am of the utmost importance, to the future where I may be worth nothing. Shouldn\u0027t I be asking for more? For my family? For the remainder of my people? My skin itches with the ashes of the dead. I feel the sickening impact of the skull against my shoe. The scent of blood and roses stings my nose. The pencil moves across the page on its own. I open my eyes and see the wobbly letters.I KILL SNOW. If he\u0027s captured, I want the privilege. Plutarch gives a discreet cough. \"About done there?\" I glance up and notice the clock. I\u0027ve been sitting here for twenty minutes. Finnick isn\u0027t the only one with attention problems. \"Yeah,\" I say. My voice sounds hoarse, so I clear my throat. \"Yeah, so this is the deal. I\u0027ll be your Mockingjay.\" I wait so they can make their sounds of relief, congratulate, slap one another on the back. Coin stays as impassive as ever, watching me, unimpressed. \"But I have some conditions.\" I smooth out the list and begin. \"My family gets to keep our cat.\" My tiniest request sets off an argument. The Capitol rebels see this as a nonissue - of course, I can keep my pet - while those from 13 spell out what extreme difficulties this presents. Finally it\u0027s worked out that we\u0027ll be moved to the top level, which has the luxury of an eight-inch window aboveground. Buttercup may come and go to do his business. He will be expected to feed himself. If he misses curfew, he will be locked out. If he causes any security problems, he\u0027ll be shot immediately. That sounds okay. Not so different from how he\u0027s been living since we left. Except for the shooting part. If he looks too thin, I can slip him a few entrails, provided my next request is allowed. \"I want to hunt. With Gale. Out in the woods,\" I say. This gives everyone pause. \"We won\u0027t go far. We\u0027ll use our own bows. You can have the meat for the kitchen,\" adds Gale. I hurry on before they can say no. \"It\u0027s just...I can\u0027t breathe shut up here like a...I would get better, faster, if...I could hunt.\" Plutarch begins to explain the drawbacks here - the dangers, the extra security, the risk of injury - but Coin cuts him off. \"No. Let them. Give them two hours a day, deducted from their training time. A quarter-mile radius. With communication units and tracker anklets. What\u0027s next?\" I skim my list. \"Gale. I\u0027ll need him with me to do this.\" \"With you how? Off camera? By your side at all times? Do you want him presented as your new lover?\" Coin asks. She hasn\u0027t said this with any particular malice - quite the contrary, her words are very matter-of-fact. But my mouth still drops open in shock. \"What?\" \"I think we should continue the current romance. A quick defection from Peeta could cause the audience to lose sympathy for her,\" says Plutarch. \"Especially since they think she\u0027s pregnant with his child.\" \"Agreed. So, on-screen, Gale can simply be portrayed as a fellow rebel. Is that all right?\" says Coin. I just stare at her. She repeats herself impatiently. \"For Gale. Will that be sufficient?\" \"We can always work him in as your cousin,\" says Fulvia. \"We\u0027re not cousins,\" Gale and I say together. \"Right, but we should probably keep that up for appearances\u0027 sake on camera,\" says Plutarch. \"Off camera, he\u0027s all yours. Anything else?\" I\u0027m rattled by the turn in the conversation. The implications that I could so readily dispose of Peeta, that I\u0027m in love with Gale, that the whole thing has been an act. My cheeks begin to burn. The very notion that I\u0027m devoting any thought to who I want presented as my lover, given our current circumstances, is demeaning. I let my anger propel me into my greatest demand. \"When the war is over, if we\u0027ve won, Peeta will be pardoned.\" Dead silence. I feel Gale\u0027s body tense. I guess I should have told him before, but I wasn\u0027t sure how he\u0027d respond. Not when it involved Peeta. \"No form of punishment will be inflicted,\" I continue. A new thought occurs to me. \"The same goes for the other captured tributes, Johanna and Enobaria.\" Frankly, I don\u0027t care about Enobaria, the vicious District 2 tribute. In fact, I dislike her, but it seems wrong to leave her out. \"No,\" says Coin flatly. \"Yes,\" I shoot back. \"It\u0027s not their fault you abandoned them in the arena. Who knows what the Capitol\u0027s doing to them?\" \"They\u0027ll be tried with other war criminals and treated as the tribunal sees fit,\" she says. \"They\u0027ll be granted immunity!\" I feel myself rising from my chair, my voice full and resonant. \"You will personally pledge this in front of the entire population of District Thirteen and the remainder of Twelve. Soon. Today. It will be recorded for future generations. You will hold yourself and your government responsible for their safety, or you\u0027ll find yourself another Mockingjay!\" My words hang in the air for a long moment. \"That\u0027s her!\" I hear Fulvia hiss to Plutarch. \"Right there. With the costume, gunfire in the background, just a hint of smoke.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what we want,\" says Plutarch under his breath. I want to glare at them, but I feel it would be a mistake to turn my attention from Coin. I can see her tallying the cost of my ultimatum, weighing it against my possible worth. \"What do you say, President?\" asks Plutarch. \"You could issue an official pardon, given the circumstances. The boy...he\u0027s not even of age.\" \"All right,\" Coin says finally. \"But you\u0027d better perform.\" \"I\u0027ll perform when you\u0027ve made the announcement,\" I say. \"Call a national security assembly during Reflection today,\" she orders. \"I\u0027ll make the announcement then. Is there anything left on your list, Katniss?\" My paper\u0027s crumpled into a ball in my right fist. I flatten the sheet against the table and read the rickety letters. \"Just one more thing. I kill Snow.\" For the first time ever, I see the hint of a smile on the president\u0027s lips. \"When the time comes, I\u0027ll flip you for it.\" Maybe she\u0027s right. I certainly don\u0027t have the sole claim against Snow\u0027s life. And I think I can count on her getting the job done. \"Fair enough.\" Coin\u0027s eyes have flickered to her arm, the clock. She, too, has a schedule to adhere to. \"I\u0027ll leave her in your hands, then, Plutarch.\" She exits the room, followed by her team, leaving only Plutarch, Fulvia, Gale, and myself. \"Excellent. Excellent.\" Plutarch sinks down, elbows on the table, rubbing his eyes. \"You know what I miss? More than anything? Coffee. I ask you, would it be so unthinkable to have something to wash down the gruel and turnips?\" \"We didn\u0027t think it would be quite so rigid here,\" Fulvia explains to us as she massages Plutarch\u0027s shoulders. \"Not in the higher ranks.\" \"Or at least there\u0027d be the option of a little side action,\" says Plutarch. \"I mean, even Twelve had a black market, right?\" \"Yeah, the Hob,\" says Gale. \"It\u0027s where we traded.\" \"There, you see? And look how moral you two are! Virtually incorruptible.\" Plutarch sighs. \"Oh, well, wars don\u0027t last forever. So, glad to have you on the team.\" He reaches a hand out to the side, where Fulvia is already extending a large sketchbook bound in black leather. \"You know in general what we\u0027re asking of you, Katniss. I\u0027m aware you have mixed feelings about participating. I hope this will help.\" Plutarch slides the sketchbook across to me. For a moment, I look at it suspiciously. Then curiosity gets the better of me. I open the cover to find a picture of myself, standing straight and strong, in a black uniform. Only one person could have designed the outfit, at first glance utterly utilitarian, at second a work of art. The swoop of the helmet, the curve to the breastplate, the slight fullness of the sleeves that allows the white folds under the arms to show. In his hands, I am again a mockingjay. \"Cinna,\" I whisper. \"Yes. He made me promise not to show you this book until you\u0027d decided to be the Mockingjay on your own. Believe me, I was very tempted,\" says Plutarch. \"Go on. Flip through.\" I turn the pages slowly, seeing each detail of the uniform. The carefully tailored layers of body armor, the hidden weapons in the boots and belt, the special reinforcements over my heart. On the final page, under a sketch of my mockingjay pin, Cinna\u0027s written, I\u0027m still betting on you. \"When did he...\" My voice fails me. \"Let\u0027s see. Well, after the Quarter Quell announcement. A few weeks before the Games maybe? There are not only the sketches. We have your uniforms. Oh, and Beetee\u0027s got something really special waiting for you down in the armory. I won\u0027t spoil it by hinting,\" says Plutarch. \"You\u0027re going to be the best-dressed rebel in history,\" says Gale with a smile. Suddenly, I realize he\u0027s been holding out on me. Like Cinna, he\u0027s wanted me to make this decision all along. \"Our plan is to launch an Airtime Assault,\" says Plutarch. \"To make a series of what we call propos - which is short for \u0027propaganda spots\u0027 - featuring you, and broadcast them to the entire population of Panem.\" \"How? The Capitol has sole control of the broadcasts,\" says Gale. \"But we have Beetee. About ten years ago, he essentially redesigned the underground network that transmits all the programming. He thinks there\u0027s a reasonable chance it can be done. Of course, we\u0027ll need something to air. So, Katniss, the studio awaits your pleasure.\" Plutarch turns to his assistant. \"Fulvia?\" \"Plutarch and I have been talking about how on earth we can pull this off. We think that it might be best to build you, our rebel leader, from the outside...in. That is to say, let\u0027s find the most stunning Mockingjay look possible, and then work your personality up to deserving it!\" she says brightly. \"You already have her uniform,\" says Gale. \"Yes, but is she scarred and bloody? Is she glowing with the fire of rebellion? Just how grimy can we make her without disgusting people? At any rate, she has to be something. I mean, obviously this\" - Fulvia moves in on me quickly, framing my face with her hands - \"won\u0027t cut it.\" I jerk my head back reflexively but she\u0027s already busy gathering her things. \"So, with that in mind, we have another little surprise for you. Come, come.\" Fulvia gives us a wave, and Gale and I follow her and Plutarch out into the hall. \"So well intended, and yet so insulting,\" Gale whispers in my ear. \"Welcome to the Capitol,\" I mouth back. But Fulvia\u0027s words have no effect on me. I wrap my arms tightly around the sketchbook and allow myself to feel hopeful. This must be the right decision. If Cinna wanted it. We board an elevator, and Plutarch checks his notes. \"Let\u0027s see. It\u0027s Compartment Three-Nine-Oh-Eight.\" He presses a button marked 39 , but nothing happens. \"You must have to key it,\" says Fulvia. Plutarch pulls a key attached to a thin chain from under his shirt and inserts it into a slot I hadn\u0027t noticed before. The doors slide shut. \"Ah, there we are.\" The elevator descends ten, twenty, thirty-plus levels, farther down than I even knew District 13 went. It opens on a wide white corridor lined with red doors, which look almost decorative compared to the gray ones on the upper floors. Each is plainly marked with a number 3901, 3902, 3903 ... As we step out, I glance behind me to watch the elevator close and see a metallic grate slide into place over the regular doors. When I turn, a guard has materialized from one of the rooms at the far end of the corridor. A door swings silently shut behind him as he strides toward us. Plutarch moves to meet him, raising a hand in greeting, and the rest of us follow behind him. Something feels very wrong down here. It\u0027s more than the reinforced elevator, or the claustrophobia of being so far underground, or the caustic smell of antiseptic. One look at Gale\u0027s face and I can tell he senses it as well. \"Good morning, we were just looking for - \" Plutarch begins. \"You have the wrong floor,\" says the guard abruptly. \"Really?\" Plutarch double-checks his notes. \"I\u0027ve got Three-Nine-Oh-Eight written right here. I wonder if you could just give a call up to - \" \"I\u0027m afraid I have to ask you to leave now. Assignment discrepancies can be addressed at the Head Office,\" says the guard. It\u0027s right ahead of us. Compartment 3908. Just a few steps away. The door - in fact, all the doors - seem incomplete. No knobs. They must swing free on hinges like the one the guard appeared through. \"Where is that again?\" asks Fulvia. \"You\u0027ll find the Head Office on Level Seven,\" says the guard, extending his arms to corral us back to the elevator. From behind door 3908 comes a sound. Just a tiny whimper. Like something a cowed dog might make to avoid being struck, only all too human and familiar. My eyes meet Gale\u0027s for just a moment, but it\u0027s long enough for two people who operate the way we do. I let Cinna\u0027s sketchbook fall at the guard\u0027s feet with a loud bang. A second after he leans down to retrieve it, Gale leans down, too, intentionally bumping heads. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" he says with a light laugh, catching the guard\u0027s arms as if to steady himself, turning him slightly away from me. That\u0027s my chance. I dart around the distracted guard, push open the door marked 3908 , and find them. Half-naked, bruised, and shackled to the wall. My prep team.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-3.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) My name is Katniss Everdeen.
