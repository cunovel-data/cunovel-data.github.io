{"id":64034,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"14\n District 2 is a large district, as one might expect, composed of a series of villages spread across the mountains. Each was originally associated with a mine or quarry, although now, many are devoted to the housing and training of Peacekeepers. None of this would present much of a challenge, since the rebels have 13\u0027s airpower on their side, except for one thing: At the center of the district is a virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of the Capitol\u0027s military.\n We\u0027ve nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed Plutarch\u0027s \"tough nut to crack\" comment to the weary and discouraged rebel leaders here. The Nut was established directly after the Dark Days, when the Capitol had lost 13 and was desperate for a new underground stronghold. They had some of their military resources situated on the outskirts of the Capitol itself - nuclear missiles, aircraft, troops - but a significant chunk of their power was now under an enemy\u0027s control. Of course, there was no way they could hope to replicate 13, which was the work of centuries. However, in the old mines of nearby District 2, they saw opportunity. From the air, the Nut appeared to be just another mountain with a few entrances on its faces. But inside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs of stones had been cut, hauled to the surface, and transported down slippery narrow roads to make distant buildings. There was even a train system to facilitate transporting the miners from the Nut to the very center of the main town in District 2. It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during the Victory Tour, standing on the wide marble steps of the Justice Building, trying not to look too closely at Cato\u0027s and Clove\u0027s grieving families assembled below us.\n It was not the most ideal terrain, plagued as it was by mudslides, floods, and avalanches. But the advantages outweighed the concerns. As they\u0027d cut deep into the mountain, the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone to support the infrastructure. The Capitol reinforced these and set about making the mountain their new military base. Filling it with computer banks and meeting rooms, barracks and arsenals. Widening entrances to allow the exit of hovercraft from the hangar, installing missile launchers. But on the whole, leaving the exterior of the mountain largely unchanged. A rough, rocky tangle of trees and wildlife. A natural fortress to protect them from their enemies.\n By the other districts\u0027 standards, the Capitol babied the inhabitants here. Just by looking at the District 2 rebels, you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers. Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the people of 2 swallowed the Capitol\u0027s propaganda more easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who formed the backbone of the resistance here.\n Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks ago. The outer villages are in rebel hands, the town divided, and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its few entrances heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain. While every other district has now wrested control from the Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.\n Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I\u0027m not allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in 13. It\u0027s much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm, fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel villages or surrounding caves. For safety\u0027s sake, I\u0027m relocated often. During the day, I\u0027ve been given clearance to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don\u0027t stray too far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.\n Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond recognition, and made me a present of him. Boggs, who came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting, it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13 hadn\u0027t made the effort, Peeta would\u0027ve been delivered to me anyway. Dropped off in an actively warring district or perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my name. Programmed to murder me.\n It\u0027s only now that he\u0027s been corrupted that I can fully appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would\u0027ve if he\u0027d died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and Gale, how many people in the world love me unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be none. Sometimes when I\u0027m alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a name to the thing I\u0027ve lost. But what\u0027s the use? It\u0027s gone. He\u0027s gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that\u0027s left is my promise to kill Snow. I tell myself this ten times a day.\n Back in 13, Peeta\u0027s rehabilitation continues. Even though I don\u0027t ask, Plutarch gives me cheerful updates on the phone like \"Good news, Katniss! I think we\u0027ve almost got him convinced you\u0027re not a mutt!\" Or \"Today he was allowed to feed himself pudding!\"\n When Haymitch gets on after, he admits Peeta\u0027s no better. The only dubious ray of hope has come from my sister. \"Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack him back,\" Haymitch tells me. \"Bring up the distorted memories of you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug, like morphling. We\u0027ve only tried it on one memory. The tape of the two of you in the cave, when you told him that story about getting Prim the goat.\"\n \"Any improvement?\" I ask.\n \"Well, if extreme confusion is an improvement over extreme terror, then yes,\" says Haymitch. \"But I\u0027m not sure it is. He lost the ability to speak for several hours. Went into some sort of stupor. When he came out, the only thing he asked about was the goat.\"\n \"Right,\" I say.\n \"How\u0027s it out there?\" he asks.\n \"No forward motion,\" I tell him.\n \"We\u0027re sending out a team to help with the mountain. Beetee and some of the others,\" he says. \"You know, the brains.\"\n When the brains are selected, I\u0027m not surprised to see Gale\u0027s name on the list. I thought Beetee would bring him, not for his technological expertise, but in the hopes that he could somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountain. Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee. I told him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed. I didn\u0027t tell him his presence would make it even more difficult for me to mourn Peeta.\n Gale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon. I\u0027m sitting on a log at the edge of my current village, plucking a goose. A dozen or so of the birds are piled at my feet. Great flocks of them have been migrating through here since I\u0027ve arrived, and the pickings are easy. Without a word, Gale settles beside me and begins to relieve a bird of its feathers. We\u0027re through about half when he says, \"Any chance we\u0027ll get to eat these?\"\n \"Yeah. Most go to the camp kitchen, but they expect me to give a couple to whoever I\u0027m staying with tonight,\" I say. \"For keeping me.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t the honor of the thing enough?\" he says.\n \"You\u0027d think,\" I reply. \"But word\u0027s gotten out that mockingjays are hazardous to your health.\"\n We pluck in silence for a while longer. Then he says, \"I saw Peeta yesterday. Through the glass.\"\n \"What\u0027d you think?\" I ask.\n \"Something selfish,\" says Gale.\n \"That you don\u0027t have to be jealous of him anymore?\" My fingers give a yank, and a cloud of feathers floats down around us.\n \"No. Just the opposite.\" Gale pulls a feather out of my hair. \"I thought...I\u0027ll never compete with that. No matter how much pain I\u0027m in.\" He spins the feather between his thumb and forefinger. \"I don\u0027t stand a chance if he doesn\u0027t get better. You\u0027ll never be able to let him go. You\u0027ll always feel wrong about being with me.\"\n \"The way I always felt wrong kissing him because of you,\" I say.\n Gale holds my gaze. \"If I thought that was true, I could almost live with the rest of it.\"\n \"It is true,\" I admit. \"But so is what you said about Peeta.\"\n Gale makes a sound of exasperation. Nonetheless, after we\u0027ve dropped off the birds and volunteered to go back to the woods to gather kindling for the evening fire, I find myself wrapped in his arms. His lips brushing the faded bruises on my neck, working their way to my mouth. Despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep down that he\u0027ll never come back to me. Or I\u0027ll never go back to him. I\u0027ll stay in 2 until it falls, go to the Capitol and kill Snow, and then die for my trouble. And he\u0027ll die insane and hating me. So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kiss Gale to make up for all the kisses I\u0027ve withheld, and because it doesn\u0027t matter anymore, and because I\u0027m so desperately lonely I can\u0027t stand it. Gale\u0027s touch and taste and heat remind me that at least my body\u0027s still alive, and for the moment it\u0027s a welcome feeling. I empty my mind and let the sensations run through my flesh, happy to lose myself. When Gale pulls away slightly, I move forward to close the gap, but I feel his hand under my chin. \"Katniss,\" he says. The instant I open my eyes, the world seems disjointed. This is not our woods or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion. \"Now kiss me.\" Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly. He examines my face closely. \"What\u0027s going on in your head?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I whisper back.\n \"Then it\u0027s like kissing someone who\u0027s drunk. It doesn\u0027t count,\" he says with a weak attempt at a laugh. He scoops up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms, returning me to myself.\n \"How do you know?\" I say, mostly to cover my embarrassment. \"Have you kissed someone who\u0027s drunk?\" I guess Gale could\u0027ve been kissing girls right and left back in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about it much before.\n He just shakes his head. \"No. But it\u0027s not hard to imagine.\"\n \"So, you never kissed any other girls?\" I ask.\n \"I didn\u0027t say that. You know, you were only twelve when we met. And a real pain besides. I did have a life outside of hunting with you,\" he says, loading up with firewood.\n Suddenly, I\u0027m genuinely curious. \"Who did you kiss? And where?\"\n \"Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the slag heap, you name it,\" he says.\n I roll my eyes. \"So when did I become so special? When they carted me off to the Capitol?\"\n \"No. About six months before that. Right after New Year\u0027s. We were in the Hob, eating some slop of Greasy Sae\u0027s. And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit for one of his kisses. And I realized...I minded,\" he tells me.\n I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the afternoon. We\u0027d been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae\u0027s soup, made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we\u0027d shot a week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting cross-legged on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his lips. \"See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and ask her.If you need a reference.\"\n A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this happened. \"Darius was just joking around,\" I say.\n \"Probably. Although you\u0027d be the last to figure out if he wasn\u0027t,\" Gale tells me. \"Take Peeta. Take me. Or even Finnick. I was starting to worry he had his eye on you, but he seems back on track now.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know Finnick if you think he\u0027d love me,\" I say.\n Gale shrugs. \"I know he was desperate. That makes people do all kinds of crazy things.\"\n I can\u0027t help thinking that\u0027s directed at me.\n Bright and early the next morning, the brains assemble to take on the problem of the Nut. I\u0027m asked to the meeting, although I don\u0027t have much to contribute. I avoid the conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has a view of the mountain in question. The commander from 2, a middle-aged woman named Lyme, takes us on a virtual tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, and recounts the failed attempts to seize it. I\u0027ve crossed paths with her briefly a couple of times since my arrival, and was dogged by the feeling I\u0027d met her before. She\u0027s memorable enough, standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled. But it\u0027s only when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize I\u0027m in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for the Quarter Quell. I\u0027ve probably caught glimpses of her during the Games over the years, but she\u0027s kept a low profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch\u0027s and Finnick\u0027s treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol do to her after she won?\n When Lyme finishes the presentation, the questions from the brains begin. Hours pass, and lunch comes and goes, as they try to come up with a realistic plan for taking the Nut. But while Beetee thinks he might be able to override certain computer systems, and there\u0027s some discussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use, no one has any really innovative thoughts. As the afternoon wears on, talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been tried repeatedly - the storming of the entrances. I can see Lyme\u0027s frustration building because so many variations of this plan have already failed, so many of her soldiers have been lost. Finally, she bursts out, \"The next person who suggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant way to do it, because you\u0027re going to be the one leading that mission!\"\n Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more than a few hours, has been alternating between pacing and sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemed to accept Lyme\u0027s assertion that the entrances couldn\u0027t be taken, and dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or so, he\u0027s sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration, staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence that follows Lyme\u0027s ultimatum, he speaks up. \"Is it really so necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to disable it?\"\n \"That would be a step in the right direction,\" says Beetee. \"What do you have in mind?\"\n \"Think of it as a wild dog den,\" Gale continues. \"You\u0027re not going to fight your way in. So you have two choices. Trap the dogs inside or flush them out.\"\n \"We\u0027ve tried bombing the entrances,\" says Lyme. \"They\u0027re set too far inside the stone for any real damage to be done.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of that,\" says Gale. \"I was thinking of using the mountain.\" Beetee rises and joins Gale at the window, peering through his ill-fitting glasses. \"See? Running down the sides?\"\n \"Avalanche paths,\" says Beetee under his breath. \"It\u0027d be tricky. We\u0027d have to design the detonation sequence with great care, and once it\u0027s in motion, we couldn\u0027t hope to control it.\"\n \"We don\u0027t need to control it if we give up the idea that we have to possess the Nut,\" says Gale. \"Only shut it down.\"\n \"So you\u0027re suggesting we start avalanches and block the entrances?\" asks Lyme.\n \"That\u0027s it,\" says Gale. \"Trap the enemy inside, cut off from supplies. Make it impossible for them to send out their hovercraft.\"\n While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns. \"You risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilation system. It\u0027s rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in Thirteen. It depends entirely on pumping in air from the mountainsides. Block those vents and you\u0027ll suffocate whoever is trapped.\"\n \"They could still escape through the train tunnel to the square,\" says Beetee.\n \"Not if we blow it up,\" says Gale brusquely. His intent, his full intent, becomes clear. Gale has no interest in preserving the lives of those in the Nut. No interest in caging the prey for later use.\n This is one of his death traps. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-14.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) \n My name is Katniss Everdeen. \n Why am I not dead? \n I should be dead. \n Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.
