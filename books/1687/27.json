An awful gurgling cackle accompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when the coughing begins. I see him bend forward, spewing out his life, until the guards block him from my sight.\\n\\n As the gray uniforms begin to converge on me, I think of what my brief future as the assassin of Panem\u0027s new president holds. The interrogation, probable torture, certain public execution. Having, yet again, to say my final goodbyes to the handful of people who still maintain a hold on my heart. The prospect of facing my mother, who will now be entirely alone in the world, decides it.\\n\\n \"Good night,\" I whisper to the bow in my hand and feel it go still. I raise my left arm and twist my neck down to rip off the pill on my sleeve. Instead my teeth sink into flesh. I yank my head back in confusion to find myself looking into Peeta\u0027s eyes, only now they hold my gaze. Blood runs from the teeth marks on the hand he clamped over my nightlock. \"Let me go!\" I snarl at him, trying to wrest my arm from his grasp.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t,\" he says. As they pull me away from him, I feel the pocket ripped from my sleeve, see the deep violet pill fall to the ground, watch Cinna\u0027s last gift get crunched under a guard\u0027s boot. I transform into a wild animal, kicking, clawing, biting, doing whatever I can to free myself from this web of hands as the crowd pushes in. The guards lift me up above the fray, where I continue to thrash as I\u0027m conveyed over the crush of people. I start screaming for Gale. I can\u0027t find him in the throng, but he will know what I want. A good clean shot to end it all. Only there\u0027s no arrow, no bullet. Is it possible he can\u0027t see me? No. Above us, on the giant screens placed around the City Circle, everyone can watch the whole thing being played out. He sees, he knows, but he doesn\u0027t follow through. Just as I didn\u0027t when he was captured. Sorry excuses for hunters and friends. Both of us.\\n\\n I\u0027m on my own.\\n\\n In the mansion, they handcuff and blindfold me. I\u0027m half dragged, half carried down long passages, up and down elevators, and deposited on a carpeted floor. The cuffs are removed and a door slams closed behind me. When I push the blindfold up, I find I\u0027m in my old room at the Training Center. The one where I lived during those last precious days before my first Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell. The bed\u0027s stripped to the mattress, the closet gapes open, showing the emptiness inside, but I\u0027d know this room anywhere.\\n\\n It\u0027s a struggle to get to my feet and peel off my Mockingjay suit. I\u0027m badly bruised and might have a broken finger or two, but it\u0027s my skin that\u0027s paid most dearly for my struggle with the guards. The new pink stuff has shredded like tissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratory-grown cells. No medics show up, though, and as I\u0027m too far gone to care, I crawl up onto the mattress, expecting to bleed to death.\\n\\n No such luck. By evening, the blood clots, leaving me stiff and sore and sticky but alive. I limp into the shower and program in the gentlest cycle I can remember, free of any soaps and hair products, and squat under the warm spray, elbows on my knees, head in my hands.\\n\\n My name is Katniss Everdeen. Why am I not dead? I should be dead. It would be best for everyone if I were dead....\\n\\n When I step out on the mat, the hot air bakes my damaged skin dry. There\u0027s nothing clean to put on. Not even a towel to wrap around me. Back in the room, I find the Mockingjay suit has disappeared. In its place is a paper robe. A meal has been sent up from the mysterious kitchen with a container of my medications for dessert. I go ahead and eat the food, take the pills, rub the salve on my skin. I need to focus now on the manner of my suicide.\\n\\n I curl back up on the bloodstained mattress, not cold but feeling so naked with just the paper to cover my tender flesh. Jumping to my death\u0027s not an option - the window glass must be a foot thick. I can make an excellent noose, but there\u0027s nothing to hang myself from. It\u0027s possible I could hoard my pills and then knock myself off with a lethal dose, except that I\u0027m sure I\u0027m being watched round the clock. For all I know, I\u0027m on live television at this very moment while commentators try to analyze what could possibly have motivated me to kill Coin. The surveillance makes almost any suicide attempt impossible. Taking my life is the Capitol\u0027s privilege. Again.\\n\\n What I can do is give up. I resolve to lie on the bed without eating, drinking, or taking my medications. I could do it, too. Just die. If it weren\u0027t for the morphling withdrawal. Not bit by bit like in the hospital in 13, but cold turkey. I must have been on a fairly large dose because when the craving for it hits, accompanied by tremors, and shooting pains, and unbearable cold, my resolve\u0027s crushed like an eggshell. I\u0027m on my knees, raking the carpet with my fingernails to find those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment. I revise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling. I will become a yellow-skinned bag of bones, with enormous eyes. I\u0027m a couple of days into the plan, making good progress, when something unexpected happens.\\n\\n I begin to sing. At the window, in the shower, in my sleep. Hour after hour of ballads, love songs, mountain airs. All the songs my father taught me before he died, for certainly there has been very little music in my life since. What\u0027s amazing is how clearly I remember them. The tunes, the lyrics. My voice, at first rough and breaking on the high notes, warms up into something splendid. A voice that would make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble over themselves to join in. Days pass, weeks. I watch the snows fall on the ledge outside my window. And in all that time, mine is the only voice I hear.\\n\\n What are they doing, anyway? What\u0027s the holdup out there? How difficult can it be to arrange the execution of one murderous girl? I continue with my own annihilation. My body\u0027s thinner than it\u0027s ever been and my battle against hunger is so fierce that sometimes the animal part of me gives in to the temptation of buttered bread or roasted meat. But still, I\u0027m winning. For a few days I feel quite unwell and think I may finally be traveling out of this life, when I realize my morphling tablets are shrinking. They are trying to slowly wean me off the stuff. But why? Surely a drugged Mockingjay will be easier to dispose of in front of a crowd. And then a terrible thought hits me: What if they\u0027re not going to kill me? What if they have more plans for me? A new way to remake, train, and use me?\\n\\n I won\u0027t do it. If I can\u0027t kill myself in this room, I will take the first opportunity outside of it to finish the job. They can fatten me up. They can give me a full body polish, dress me up, and make me beautiful again. They can design dream weapons that come to life in my hands, but they will never again brainwash me into the necessity of using them. I no longer feel any allegiance to these monsters called human beings, despise being one myself. I think that Peeta was onto something about us destroying one another and letting some decent species take over. Because something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children\u0027s lives to settle its differences. You can spin it any way you like. Snow thought the Hunger Games were an efficient means of control. Coin thought the parachutes would expedite the war. But in the end, who does it benefit? No one. The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where these things happen.\\n\\n After two days of my lying on my mattress with no attempt to eat, drink, or even take a morphling tablet, the door to my room opens. Someone crosses around the bed into my field of vision. Haymitch. \"Your trial\u0027s over,\" he says. \"Come on. We\u0027re going home.\"\\n\\n Home? What\u0027s he talking about? My home\u0027s gone. And even if it were possible to go to this imaginary place, I am too weak to move. Strangers appear. Rehydrate and feed me. Bathe and clothe me. One lifts me like a rag doll and carries me up to the roof, onto a hovercraft, and fastens me into a seat. Haymitch and Plutarch sit across from me. In a few moments, we\u0027re airborne.\\n\\n I\u0027ve never seen Plutarch in such a good mood. He\u0027s positively glowing. \"You must have a million questions!\" When I don\u0027t respond, he answers them anyway.\\n\\n After I shot Coin, there was pandemonium. When the ruckus died down, they discovered Snow\u0027s body, still tethered to the post. Opinions differ on whether he choked to death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd. No one really cares. An emergency election was thrown together and Paylor was voted in as president. Plutarch was appointed secretary of communications, which means he sets the programming for the airwaves. The first big televised event was my trial, in which he was also a star witness. In my defense, of course. Although most of the credit for my exoneration must be given to Dr. Aurelius, who apparently earned his naps by presenting me as a hopeless, shell-shocked lunatic. One condition for my release is that I\u0027ll continue under his care, although it will have to be by phone because he\u0027d never live in a forsaken place like 12, and I\u0027m confined there until further notice. The truth is, no one quite knows what to do with me now that the war\u0027s over, although if another one should spring up, Plutarch\u0027s sure they could find a role for me. Then Plutarch has a good laugh. It never seems to bother him when no one else appreciates his jokes.\\n\\n \"Are you preparing for another war, Plutarch?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Oh, not now. Now we\u0027re in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated,\" he says. \"But collective thinking is usually short-lived. We\u0027re fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it, Katniss.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"The time it sticks. Maybe we are witnessing the evolution of the human race. Think about that.\" And then he asks me if I\u0027d like to perform on a new singing program he\u0027s launching in a few weeks. Something upbeat would be good. He\u0027ll send the crew to my house.\\n\\n We land briefly in District 3 to drop off Plutarch. He\u0027s meeting with Beetee to update the technology on the broadcast system. His parting words to me are \"Don\u0027t be a stranger.\"\\n\\n When we\u0027re back among the clouds, I look at Haymitch. \"So why are you going back to Twelve?\"\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t seem to find a place for me in the Capitol either,\" he says.\\n\\n At first, I don\u0027t question this. But doubts begin to creep in. Haymitch hasn\u0027t assassinated anyone. He could go anywhere. If he\u0027s coming back to 12, it\u0027s because he\u0027s been ordered to. \"You have to look after me, don\u0027t you? As my mentor?\" He shrugs. Then I realize what it means. \"My mother\u0027s not coming back.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he says. He pulls an envelope from his jacket pocket and hands it to me. I examine the delicate, perfectly formed writing. \"She\u0027s helping to start up a hospital in District Four. She wants you to call as soon as we get in.\" My finger traces the graceful swoop of the letters. \"You know why she can\u0027t come back.\" Yes, I know why. Because between my father and Prim and the ashes, the place is too painful to bear. But apparently not for me. \"Do you want to know who else won\u0027t be there?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say. \"I want to be surprised.\"\\n\\n Like a good mentor, Haymitch makes me eat a sandwich and then pretends he believes I\u0027m asleep for the rest of the trip. He busies himself going through every compartment on the hovercraft, finding the liquor, and stowing it in his bag. It\u0027s night when we land on the green of the Victor\u0027s Village. Half of the houses have lights in the windows, including Haymitch\u0027s and mine. Not Peeta\u0027s. Someone has built a fire in my kitchen. I sit in the rocker before it, clutching my mother\u0027s letter.\\n\\n \"Well, see you tomorrow,\" says Haymitch.\\n\\n As the clinking of his bag of liquor bottles fades away, I whisper, \"I doubt it.\"\\n\\n I am unable to move from the chair. The rest of the house looms cold and empty and dark. I pull an old shawl over my body and watch the flames. I guess I sleep, because the next thing I know, it\u0027s morning and Greasy Sae\u0027s banging around at the stove. She makes me eggs and toast and sits there until I\u0027ve eaten it all. We don\u0027t talk much. Her little granddaughter, the one who lives in her own world, takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mother\u0027s knitting basket. Greasy Sae tells her to put it back, but I say she can have it. No one in this house can knit anymore. After breakfast, Greasy Sae does the dishes and leaves, but she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eat again. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s just being neighborly or if she\u0027s on the government\u0027s payroll, but she shows up twice every day. She cooks, I consume. I try to figure out my next move. There\u0027s no obstacle now to taking my life. But I seem to be waiting for something.\\n\\n Sometimes the phone rings and rings and rings, but I don\u0027t pick it up. Haymitch never visits. Maybe he changed his mind and left, although I suspect he\u0027s just drunk. No one comes but Greasy Sae and her granddaughter. After months of solitary confinement, they seem like a crowd.\\n\\n \"Spring\u0027s in the air today. You ought to get out,\" she says. \"Go hunting.\"\\n\\n I haven\u0027t left the house. I haven\u0027t even left the kitchen except to go to the small bathroom a few steps off of it. I\u0027m in the same clothes I left the Capitol in. What I do is sit by the fire. Stare at the unopened letters piling up on the mantel. \"I don\u0027t have a bow.\"\\n\\n \"Check down the hall,\" she says.\\n\\n After she leaves, I consider a trip down the hall. Rule it out. But after several hours, I go anyway, walking in silent sock feet, so as not to awaken the ghosts. In the study, where I had my tea with President Snow, I find a box with my father\u0027s hunting jacket, our plant book, my parents\u0027 wedding photo, the spile Haymitch sent in, and the locket Peeta gave me in the clock arena. The two bows and a sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the firebombing lie on the desk. I put on the hunting jacket and leave the rest of the stuff untouched. I fall asleep on the sofa in the formal living room. A terrible nightmare follows, where I\u0027m lying at the bottom of a deep grave, and every dead person I know by name comes by and throws a shovel full of ashes on me. It\u0027s quite a long dream, considering the list of people, and the deeper I\u0027m buried, the harder it is to breathe. I try to call out, begging them to stop, but the ashes fill my mouth and nose and I can\u0027t make any sound. Still the shovel scrapes on and on and on....\\n\\n I wake with a start. Pale morning light comes around the edges of the shutters. The scraping of the shovel continues. Still half in the nightmare, I run down the hall, out the front door, and around the side of the house, because now I\u0027m pretty sure I can scream at the dead. When I see him, I pull up short. His face is flushed from digging up the ground under the windows. In a wheelbarrow are five scraggly bushes.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Dr. Aurelius wouldn\u0027t let me leave the Capitol until yesterday,\" Peeta says. \"By the way, he said to tell you he can\u0027t keep pretending he\u0027s treating you forever. You have to pick up the phone.\"\\n\\n He looks well. Thin and covered with burn scars like me, but his eyes have lost that clouded, tortured look. He\u0027s frowning slightly, though, as he takes me in. I make a halfhearted effort to push my hair out of my eyes and realize it\u0027s matted into clumps. I feel defensive. \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"I went to the woods this morning and dug these up. For her,\" he says. \"I thought we could plant them along the side of the house.\"\\n\\n I look at the bushes, the clods of dirt hanging from their roots, and catch my breath as the wordrose registers. I\u0027m about to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full name comes to me. Not plain rose but evening primrose. The flower my sister was named for. I give Peeta a nod of assent and hurry back into the house, locking the door behind me. But the evil thing is inside, not out. Trembling with weakness and anxiety, I run up the stairs. My foot catches on the last step and I crash onto the floor. I force myself to rise and enter my room. The smell\u0027s very faint but still laces the air. It\u0027s there. The white rose among the dried flowers in the vase. Shriveled and fragile, but holding on to that unnatural perfection cultivated in Snow\u0027s greenhouse. I grab the vase, stumble down to the kitchen, and throw its contents into the embers. As the flowers flare up, a burst of blue flame envelops the rose and devours it. Fire beats roses again. I smash the vase on the floor for good measure.\\n\\n Back upstairs, I throw open the bedroom windows to clear out the rest of Snow\u0027s stench. But it still lingers, on my clothes and in my pores. I strip, and flakes of skin the size of playing cards cling to the garments. Avoiding the mirror, I step into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair, my body, my mouth. Bright pink and tingling, I find something clean to wear. It takes half an hour to comb out my hair. Greasy Sae unlocks the front door. While she makes breakfast, I feed the clothes I had shed to the fire. At her suggestion, I pare off my nails with a knife.\\n\\n Over the eggs, I ask her, \"Where did Gale go?\"\\n\\n \"District Two. Got some fancy job there. I see him now and again on the television,\" she says.\\n\\n I dig around inside myself, trying to register anger, hatred, longing. I find only relief.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going hunting today,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t mind some fresh game at that,\" she answers.\\n\\n I arm myself with a bow and arrows and head out, intending to exit 12 through the Meadow. Near the square are teams of masked and gloved people with horse-drawn carts. Sifting through what lay under the snow this winter. Gathering remains. A cart\u0027s parked in front of the mayor\u0027s house. I recognize Thom, Gale\u0027s old crewmate, pausing a moment to wipe the sweat from his face with a rag. I remember seeing him in 13, but he must have come back. His greeting gives me the courage to ask, \"Did they find anyone in there?\"\\n\\n \"Whole family. And the two people who worked for them,\" Thom tells me.\\n\\n Madge. Quiet and kind and brave. The girl who gave me the pin that gave me a name. I swallow hard. Wonder if she\u0027ll be joining the cast of my nightmares tonight. Shoveling the ashes into my mouth. \"I thought maybe, since he was the mayor...\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think being the mayor of Twelve put the odds in his favor,\" says Thom.\\n\\n I nod and keep moving, careful not to look in the back of the cart. All through the town and the Seam, it\u0027s the same. The reaping of the dead. As I near the ruins of my old house, the road becomes thick with carts. The Meadow\u0027s gone, or at least dramatically altered. A deep pit has been dug, and they\u0027re lining it with bones, a mass grave for my people. I skirt around the hole and enter the woods at my usual place. It doesn\u0027t matter, though. The fence isn\u0027t charged anymore and has been propped up with long branches to keep out the predators. But old habits die hard. I think about going to the lake, but I\u0027m so weak that I barely make it to my meeting place with Gale. I sit on the rock where Cressida filmed us, but it\u0027s too wide without his body beside me. Several times I close my eyes and count to ten, thinking that when I open them, he will have materialized without a sound as he so often did. I have to remind myself that Gale\u0027s in 2 with a fancy job, probably kissing another pair of lips.\\n\\n It is the old Katniss\u0027s favorite kind of day. Early spring. The woods awakening after the long winter. But the spurt of energy that began with the primroses fades away. By the time I make it back to the fence, I\u0027m so sick and dizzy, Thom has to give me a ride home in the dead people\u0027s cart. Help me to the sofa in the living room, where I watch the dust motes spin in the thin shafts of afternoon light.\\n\\n My head snaps around at the hiss, but it takes awhile to believe he\u0027s real. How could he have gotten here? I take in the claw marks from some wild animal, the back paw he holds slightly above the ground, the prominent bones in his face. He\u0027s come on foot, then, all the way from 13. Maybe they kicked him out or maybe he just couldn\u0027t stand it there without her, so he came looking.\\n\\n \"It was the waste of a trip. She\u0027s not here,\" I tell him. Buttercup hisses again. \"She\u0027s not here. You can hiss all you like. You won\u0027t find Prim.\" At her name, he perks up. Raises his flattened ears. Begins to meow hopefully. \"Get out!\" He dodges the pillow I throw at him. \"Go away! There\u0027s nothing left for you here!\" I start to shake, furious with him. \"She\u0027s not coming back! She\u0027s never ever coming back here again!\" I grab another pillow and get to my feet to improve my aim. Out of nowhere, the tears begin to pour down my cheeks. \"She\u0027s dead.\" I clutch my middle to dull the pain. Sink down on my heels, rocking the pillow, crying. \"She\u0027s dead, you stupid cat. She\u0027s dead.\" A new sound, part crying, part singing, comes out of my body, giving voice to my despair. Buttercup begins to wail as well. No matter what I do, he won\u0027t go. He circles me, just out of reach, as wave after wave of sobs racks my body, until eventually I fall unconscious. But he must understand. He must know that the unthinkable has happened and to survive will require previously unthinkable acts. Because hours later, when I come to in my bed, he\u0027s there in the moonlight. Crouched beside me, yellow eyes alert, guarding me from the night.\\n\\n In the morning, he sits stoically as I clean the cuts, but digging the thorn from his paw brings on a round of those kitten mews. We both end up crying again, only this time we comfort each other. On the strength of this, I open the letter Haymitch gave me from my mother, dial the phone number, and weep with her as well. Peeta, bearing a warm loaf of bread, shows up with Greasy Sae. She makes us breakfast and I feed all my bacon to Buttercup.\\n\\n Slowly, with many lost days, I come back to life. I try to follow Dr. Aurelius\u0027s advice, just going through the motions, amazed when one finally has meaning again. I tell him my idea about the book, and a large box of parchment sheets arrives on the next train from the Capitol.\\n\\n I got the idea from our family\u0027s plant book. The place where we recorded those things you cannot trust to memory. The page begins with the person\u0027s picture. A photo if we can find it. If not, a sketch or painting by Peeta. Then, in my most careful handwriting, come all the details it would be a crime to forget. Lady licking Prim\u0027s cheek. My father\u0027s laugh. Peeta\u0027s father with the cookies. The color of Finnick\u0027s eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk. Boggs reprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes, arms slightly extended, like a bird about to take flight. On and on. We seal the pages with salt water and promises to live well to make their deaths count. Haymitch finally joins us, contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced to mentor. Additions become smaller. An old memory that surfaces. A late primrose preserved between the pages. Strange bits of happiness, like the photo of Finnick and Annie\u0027s newborn son.\\n\\n We learn to keep busy again. Peeta bakes. I hunt. Haymitch drinks until the liquor runs out, and then raises geese until the next train arrives. Fortunately, the geese can take pretty good care of themselves. We\u0027re not alone. A few hundred others return because, whatever has happened, this is our home. With the mines closed, they plow the ashes into the earth and plant food. Machines from the Capitol break ground for a new factory where we will make medicines. Although no one seeds it, the Meadow turns green again.\\n\\n Peeta and I grow back together. There are still moments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangs on until the flashbacks are over. I wake screaming from nightmares of mutts and lost children. But his arms are there to comfort me. And eventually his lips. On the night I feel that thing again, the hunger that overtook me on the beach, I know this would have happened anyway. That what I need to survive is not Gale\u0027s fire, kindled with rage and hatred. I have plenty of fire myself. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And only Peeta can give me that.\\n\\n So after, when he whispers, \"You love me. Real or not real?\"\\n\\n I tell him, \"Real.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-27.html","bookId":1687,"book":{"id":1687,"title":"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3)","description":"Storyline: Mockingjay (The Hunger Games #3) \\n My name is Katniss Everdeen. \\n Why am I not dead? \\n I should be dead. \\n Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.
