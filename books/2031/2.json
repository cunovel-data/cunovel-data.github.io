{"id":108616,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Elena was surrounded the instant she stepped into the high school parking lot. Everyone was there, the whole crowd she hadn\u0027t seen since late June, plus four or five hangers-on who hoped to gain popularity by association. One by one she accepted the welcoming hugs of her own group. Caroline had grown at least an inch and was slinkier and more like aVogue model than ever. She greeted Elena coolly and stepped back again with her green eyes narrowed like a cat\u0027s. Bonnie hadn\u0027t grown at all, and her curly red head barely came up to Elena\u0027s chin as she flung her arms around Elena. Wait a minute-curls? thought Elena. She pushed the smaller girl back. \"Bonnie! What did you do to your hair?\" \"Do you like it? I think it makes me look taller.\" Bonnie fluffed up the already fluffy bangs and smiled, her brown eyes sparkling with excitement, her little heart-shaped face alight. Elena moved on. \"Meredith. You haven\u0027t changed at all.\" This hug was equally warm on both sides. She had missed Meredith more than anyone, Elena thought, looking at the tall girl. Meredith never wore any makeup; but then, with perfect olive skin and heavy black lashes, she didn\u0027t need any. Right now she had one elegant eyebrow raised as she studied Elena. \"Well, your hair is two shades lighter from the sun... But where\u0027s your tan? I thought you were living it up on the French Riviera.\" \"You know I never tan.\" Elena held up her hands for her own inspection. The skin was flawless, like porcelain, but almost as fair and translucent as Bonnie\u0027s. \"Just a minute; that reminds me,\" Bonnie interjected, snatching one of Elena\u0027s hands. \"Guess what I learned from my cousin this summer?\" Before anyone could speak, she informed them triumphantly: \"Palm reading!\" There were groans, and some laughter. \"Laugh while you can,\" said Bonnie, not at all disturbed. \"My cousin told me I\u0027m psychic. Now, let me see...\" She peered into Elena\u0027s palm. \"Hurry up or we\u0027re going to be late,\" said Elena a bit impatiently. \"All right, all right. Now, this is your life line-or is it your heart line?\" In the crowd, someone snickered. \"Quiet; I\u0027m reaching into the void. I see... I see...\" All at once, Bonnie\u0027s face went blank, as if she were startled. Her brown eyes widened, but she no longer seemed to be staring at Elena\u0027s hand. It was as if she were lookingthrough it-at something frightening. \"You will meet a tall, dark stranger,\" Meredith murmured from behind her. There was a flurry of giggles. \"Dark, yes, and a stranger... but not tall.\" Bonnie\u0027s voice was hushed and faraway. \"Although,\" she continued after a moment, looking puzzled, \"he was tall, once.\" Her wide brown eyes lifted to Elena\u0027s in bewilderment. \"But that\u0027s impossible... isn\u0027t it?\" She dropped Elena\u0027s hand, almost flinging it away. \"I don\u0027t want to see any more.\" \"Okay, show\u0027s over. Let\u0027s go,\" Elena told the others, vaguely irritated. She\u0027d always felt psychic tricks were just that-tricks. So why was she annoyed? Just because that morning she\u0027d almost freaked out herself... The girls started toward the school building, but the roar of a finely tuned motor stopped them all in their tracks. \"Well, now,\" Caroline said, staring. \"Quite a car.\" \"Quite a Porsche,\" Meredith corrected dryly. The sleek black 911 Turbo purred through the parking lot, searching for a space, moving as lazily as a panther stalking prey. When the car came to a stop, the door opened, and they glimpsed the driver. \"Oh, my God,\" Caroline whispered. \"You can say that again,\" breathed Bonnie. From where she stood, Elena could see he had a lean, flat-muscled body. Faded jeans he probably had to peel off at night, tight T-shirt, and a leather jacket of unusual cut. His hair was wavy-and dark. He wasn\u0027t tall, though. Just average height. Elena let out her breath. \"Whois that masked man?\" said Meredith. And the remark was apt-dark sunglasses completely covered the boy\u0027s eyes, shielding his face like a mask. \"That maskedstranger ,\" someone else said, and a babble of voices rose up. \"Do you see that jacket? That\u0027s Italian, as in Roma.\" \"How would you know? You\u0027ve never been farther than Rome, New York, in your life!\" \"Uh-oh. Elena\u0027s got that look again. The hunting look.\" \"Short-Dark-and-Handsome had better be careful.\" \"He isn\u0027t short; he\u0027s perfect!\" Through the chatter, Caroline\u0027s voice suddenly rang out. \"Oh, come on, Elena. You\u0027ve already got Matt. What more do you want? What can you do with two that you can\u0027t do with one?\" \"The same thing-only longer,\" drawled Meredith, and the group dissolved into laughter. The boy had locked his car and was walking toward school. Casually, Elena started after him, the other girls right behind her in a close-knit pack. For an instant, annoyance bubbled up inside her. Couldn\u0027t she goanywhere without a parade on her heels? But Meredith caught her eye, and she smiled in spite of herself. \"Noblesse oblige,\" Meredith said softly. \"What?\" \"If you\u0027re going to be queen of the school, you have to put up with the consequences.\" Elena frowned at this as they entered the building. A long corridor stretched before them, and a figure in jeans and leather jacket was disappearing through the office doorway up ahead. Elena slowed her pace as she walked up to the office, finally stopping to glance thoughtfully at the messages on the cork bulletin board by the door. There was a large window here, through which the entire office was visible. The other girls were openly gazing through the window, and giggling. \"Nice rear view.\" \"That isdefinitely an Armani jacket.\" \"You think he\u0027s from out of state?\" Elena was straining her ears for the boy\u0027s name. There seemed to be some kind of trouble in there: Mrs. Clarke, the admissions secretary, was looking at a list and shaking her head. The boy said something, and Mrs. Clarke lifted her hands in a \"What can I say?\" gesture. She ran a finger down the list and shook her head again, conclusively. The boy started to turn away, then turned back. And when Mrs. Clarke looked up at him, her expression changed. The boy\u0027s sunglasses were now in his hand. Mrs. Clarke seemed startled by something; Elena could see her blink several times. Her lips opened and closed as if she were trying to speak. Elena wished she could see more than the back of the boy\u0027s head. Mrs. Clarke was fumbling through piles of paper now, looking dazed. At last she found a form of some kind and wrote on it, then turned it around and pushed it toward the boy. The boy wrote briefly on the form-signing it, probably-and returned it. Mrs. Clarke stared at it a second, then fumbled through a new pile of papers, finally handing what looked like a class schedule to him. Her eyes never left the boy as he took it, inclined his head in thanks, and turned to the door. Elena was wild with curiosity by now. What had just happened in there? And what did this stranger\u0027s face look like? But as he emerged from the office, he was settling his sunglasses in place again. Disappointment coursed through her. Still, she could see the rest of his face as he paused in the doorway. The dark curly hair framed features so fine that they might have been taken from an old Roman coin or medallion. High cheekbones, classical straight nose... and a mouth to keep you awake at night, Elena thought. The upper lip was beautifully sculpted, a little sensitive, a whole lot sensual. The chatter of the girls in the hallway had stopped as if someone had thrown a switch. Most of them were turning away from the boy now, looking anywhere but at him. Elena held her place by the window and gave a little toss to her head, pulling the ribbon out of her hair so that it fell loose around her shoulders. Without looking to either side, the boy moved on down the hallway. A chorus of sighs and whispers flared up the moment he was out of earshot. Elena didn\u0027t hear any of it. He\u0027d walked right by her, she thought, dazed. Right by without a glance. Dimly, she realized the bell was ringing. Meredith was tugging her arm. \"What?\" \"I said here\u0027s your schedule. We\u0027ve got trig on the second floor right now. Come on!\" Elena allowed Meredith to propel her down the corridor, up a flight of stairs, and into a classroom. She slid into an empty seat automatically and fixed her eyes on the teacher at the front without really seeing her. The shock still hadn\u0027t worn off. He\u0027d walked right by. Without a glance. She couldn\u0027t remember how long it had been since a boy had done that. They all looked, at least. Some whistled. Some stopped to talk. Some just stared. And that had always been fine with Elena. After all, what was more important than boys? They were the mark of how popular you were, of how beautiful you were. And they could be useful for all sorts of things. Sometimes they were exciting, but usually that didn\u0027t last long. Sometimes they were creeps from the beginning. Most boys, Elena reflected, were like puppies. Adorable in their place, but expendable. A very few could be more than that, could become real friends. Like Matt. Oh, Matt. Last year she\u0027d hoped that he was the one she was looking for, the boy who could make her feel... well, something more. More than the rush of triumph at making a conquest, the pride in showing your new acquisition off to the other girls. And shehad come to feel a strong affection for Matt. But over the summer, when she\u0027d had time to think, she\u0027d realized it was the affection of a cousin or sister. Ms. Halpern was passing out trigonometry books. Elena took hers mechanically and wrote her name inside, still wrapped in thought. She liked Matt more than any other boy she\u0027d known. And that was why she was going to have to tell him it was over. She hadn\u0027t known how to tell him in a letter. She didn\u0027t know how to tell him now. It wasn\u0027t that she was afraid he\u0027d kick up a fuss; he just wouldn\u0027t understand. She didn\u0027t really understand herself. It was as if she were always reaching for... something. Only, when she thought she\u0027d got it, it wasn\u0027t there. Not with Matt, not with any of the boys she\u0027d had. And then she had to start all over again. Fortunately, there was always fresh material. No boy had ever resisted her successfully, and no boy had ever ignored her. Until now. Until now. Remembering that moment in the hall, Elena found that her fingers were clenched on the pen she held. She still couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d brushed by her that way. The bell rang and everyone flooded out of the classroom, but Elena paused in the doorway. She bit her lip, scanning the river of students flowing through the hall. Then she spotted one of the hangers-on from the parking lot. \"Frances! Come here.\" Frances came eagerly, her plain face brightening. \"Listen, Frances, you remember that boy this morning?\" \"With the Porsche and the-er-assets? How could I forget?\" \"Well, I want his class schedule. Get it from the office if you can, or copy it from him if you have to. But do it!\" Frances looked surprised for a moment, then grinned and nodded. \"Okay, Elena. I\u0027ll try. I\u0027ll meet you at lunch if I can get it.\" \"Thanks.\" Elena watched the girl go. \"You know, you really are crazy,\" Meredith\u0027s voice said in her ear. \"What\u0027s the use of being queen of the school if you can\u0027t pull a little rank sometimes?\" returned Elena calmly. \"Where do I go now?\" \"General Business. Here, take it yourself.\" Meredith thrust a schedule at her. \"I\u0027ve got to run for chemistry. Later!\" General Business and the rest of the morning passed in a blur. Elena had hoped to catch another glimpse of the new student, but he was in none of her classes. Mattwas in one, and she felt a pang as his blue eyes met hers with a smile. At the lunch bell, she nodded greetings right and left as she walked to the cafeteria. Caroline was outside, posed casually against a wall with chin up, shoulders back, hips forward. The two boys she was talking to fell silent and nudged each other as Elena approached. \"Hi,\" Elena said briefly to the boys; and to Caroline: \"Ready to go in and eat?\" Caroline\u0027s green eyes barely flickered toward Elena, and she pushed glossy auburn hair out of her face. \"What, at theroyal table ?\" she said. Elena was taken aback. She and Caroline had been friends since kindergarten, and they had always competed with each other good-naturedly. But lately something had happened to Caroline. She\u0027d begun to take the rivalry more and more seriously. And now Elena was surprised at the bitterness in the other girl\u0027s voice. \"Well, it\u0027s hardly as if you were a commoner,\" she said lightly. \"Oh, you\u0027re so right about that,\" said Caroline, turning to face Elena fully. Those green cat-eyes were slitted and smoky, and Elena was shocked by the hostility she saw there. The two boys smiled uneasily and edged away. Caroline didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"A lot of things changed while you were gone this summer, Elena,\" she continued. \"And just maybe your time on the throne is running out.\" Elena had flushed; she could feel it. She struggled to keep her voice steady. \"Maybe,\" she said. \"But I wouldn\u0027t buy a scepter just yet if I were you, Caroline.\" She turned and went into the lunchroom. It was a relief to see Meredith and Bonnie, and Frances beside them. Elena felt her cheeks cool as she selected her lunch and went to join them. She wouldn\u0027t let Caroline upset her; she wouldn\u0027t think of Caroline at all. \"I got it,\" said Frances, waving a piece of paper as Elena sat down. \"And I have some good stuff,\" said Bonnie importantly. \"Elena, listen to this. He\u0027s in my biology class, and I sit right across from him. And his name is Stefan, Stefan Salvatore, and he\u0027s from Italy, and he\u0027s boarding with old Mrs. Flowers on the edge of town.\" She sighed. \"He isso romantic. Caroline dropped her books, and he picked them up for her.\" Elena made a wry face. \"How clumsy of Caroline. What else happened?\" \"Well, that\u0027s all. He didn\u0027t really talk to her. He\u0027s ver-r-ry mysterious, you see. Mrs. Endicott, my biology teacher, tried to get him to take off his glasses, but he wouldn\u0027t. He has a medical condition.\" \"What kind of medical condition?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe it\u0027s terminal and his days are numbered. Wouldn\u0027t that be romantic?\" \"Oh, very,\" said Meredith. Elena was looking over Frances\u0027s sheet of paper, biting her lip. \"He\u0027s in my seventh period, History of Europe. \"Anybody else have that class?\" \"I do,\" said Bonnie. \"And I think Caroline does, too. Oh, and maybe Matt; he said something yesterday about how it was just his luck, getting Mr. Tanner.\" Marvelous, Elena thought, picking up a fork and stabbing at her mashed potatoes. It looked as if seventh period was going to beextremely interesting. Stefan was glad the school day was almost over. He wanted to get out of these crowded rooms and corridors, just for a few minutes. So many minds. The pressure of so many thought patterns, so many mental voices surrounding him, was making him dizzy. It had been years since he had been in a swarm of people like this. One mind in particular stood out from the others. She had been among those watching him in the main corridor of the school building. He didn\u0027t know what she looked like, but her personality was powerful. He felt sure he\u0027d recognize it again. So far, at least, he\u0027d survived the first day of the masquerade. He\u0027d used the Powers only twice, and then sparingly. But he was tired, and, he admitted ruefully, hungry. The rabbit hadn\u0027t been enough. Worry about that later. He found his last classroom and sat down. And immediately he felt the presence of that mind again. It glowed at the edge of his consciousness, a golden light, soft and yet vibrant. And, for the first time, he could locate the girl it was coming from. She was seated right in front of him. Even as he thought it, she turned around and he saw her face. It was all he could do not to gasp in shock. Katherine! But of course it couldn\u0027t be. Katherine was dead; no one knew that better than he did. Still, the resemblance was uncanny. That pale golden hair, so fair it almost seemed to shimmer. That creamy skin, which had always made him think of swans, or alabaster, flushing faintly pink over the cheekbones. And the eyes... Katherine\u0027s eyes had been a color he had never seen before; darker than sky blue, as rich as the lapis lazuli in her jeweled headband. This girl had those same eyes. And they were fixed directly on his as she smiled. He looked down from the smile quickly. Of all things, he did not want to think about Katherine. He didn\u0027t want to look at this girl who reminded him of her, and he didn\u0027t want to feel her presence any longer. He kept his eyes on the desk, blocking his mind as strongly as he knew how. And at last, slowly, she turned around again. She was hurt. Even through the blocks, he could feel that. He didn\u0027t care. In fact, he was glad of it, and he hoped it would keep her away from him. Other than that, he had no feelings about her at all. He kept telling himself this as he sat, the droning voice of the teacher pouring over him unheard. But he could smell a subtle hint of some perfume-violets, he thought. And her slender white neck was bowed over her book, the fair hair falling on either side of it. In anger and frustration he recognized the seductive feeling in his teeth-more a tickling or a tingling than an ache. It was hunger, a specific hunger. And not one he was about to indulge. The teacher was pacing about the room like a ferret, asking questions, and Stefan deliberately fixed his attention on the man. At first he was puzzled, for although none of the students knew the answers, the questions kept coming. Then he realized that that was the man\u0027s purpose. To shame the students with what they didn\u0027t know. Just now he\u0027d found another victim, a small girl with clusters of red curls and a heart-shaped face. Stefan watched in distaste as the teacher badgered her with questions. She looked wretched as he turned away from her to address the entire class. \"You see what I mean? You think you\u0027re pretty hot stuff; you\u0027re seniors now, ready to graduate. Well, let me tell you, some of you aren\u0027t ready to graduate kindergarten. Like this!\" He gestured toward the red-haired girl. \"No idea about the French Revolution. Thinks Marie Antoinette was a silent film star.\" Students all around Stefan were shifting uncomfortably. He could feel the resentment in their minds, and the humiliation. And the fear. They were all afraid of this thin little man with eyes like a weasel, even the husky boys who were taller than he was. \"All right, let\u0027s try another era.\" The teacher swung back to the same girl he\u0027d been questioning. \"During the Renaissance-\" He broke off. \"Youdo know what the Renaissance is, don\u0027t you? The period between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which Europe rediscovered the great ideas of ancient Greece and Rome? The period that produced so many of Europe\u0027s greatest artists and thinkers?\" When the girl nodded confusedly, he continued. \"During the Renaissance, what would students your age be doing at school? Well? Any idea at all? Any guesses?\" The girl swallowed hard. With a weak smile she said, \"Playing football?\" At the ensuing laughter, the teacher\u0027s face darkened. \"Hardly!\" he snapped, and the classroom quieted. \"You think this is a joke? Well, in those days, students your age would already be proficient in several languages. They would also have mastered logic, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and grammar. They would be ready to go on to a university, in which every course was taught in Latin. Football would be absolutely the last thing on-\" \"Excuse me.\" The quiet voice stopped the teacher in midharangue. Everyone turned to stare at Stefan. \"What? What did you say?\" \"I said, excuse me,\" Stefan repeated, removing his glasses and standing up. \"But you\u0027re wrong. Students in the Renaissance were encouraged to participate in games. They were taught that a healthy body goes with a healthy mind. And they certainly played team sports, like cricket, tennis-and even football.\" He turned to the red-haired girl and smiled, and she smiled back gratefully. To the teacher, he added, \"But the most important things they learned were good manners and courtesy. I\u0027m sure your book will tell you that.\" Students were grinning. The teacher\u0027s face was red with blood, and he was sputtering. But Stefan continued to hold his eyes, and after another minute it was the teacher who looked away. The bell rang. Stefan put his glasses on quickly and gathered his books. He\u0027d already drawn more attention to himself than he should, and he didn\u0027t want to have to look at the blond girl again. Besides, he needed to get out of here quickly; there was a familiar burning sensation in his veins. As he reached the door, someone shouted, \"Hey! Did they really play football back then?\" He couldn\u0027t help throwing a grin over his shoulder. \"Oh, yes. Sometimes with the severed heads of prisoners of war.\" Elena watched him as he went. He\u0027d deliberately turned away from her. He\u0027d snubbed her on purpose, and in front of Caroline, who\u0027d been watching like a hawk. Tears burned in her eyes, but at that moment only one thought burned in her mind. She\u0027d have him, even if it killed her. If it killed both of them, she\u0027d have him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-awakening-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-2.html","bookId":2031,"book":{"id":2031,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Elena Gilbert is the most beautiful and popular girl in all of Robert E.
