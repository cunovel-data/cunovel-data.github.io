{"id":39352,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. — MR. M\u0027BUFFER ACCEPTS THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS","content":"It was an anxious hour for the Honourable Undecimus Scott when he first learnt that Mr. M\u0027Buffer had accepted the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. The Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds! Does it never occur to anyone how many persons are appointed to that valuable situation? Or does anyone ever reflect why a Member of Parliament, when he wishes to resign his post of honour, should not be simply gazetted in the newspapers as having done so, instead of being named as the new Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds? No one ever does think of it; resigning and becoming a steward are one and the same thing, with this difference, however, that one of the grand bulwarks of the British constitution is thus preserved. Well, Mr. M\u0027Buffer, who, having been elected by the independent electors of the Tillietudlem burghs to serve them in Parliament, could not, in accordance with the laws of the constitution, have got himself out of that honourable but difficult position by any scheme of his own, found himself on a sudden a free man, the Queen having selected him to be her steward for the district in question. We have no doubt but that the deed of appointment set forth that her Majesty had been moved to this step by the firm trust she had in the skill and fidelity of the said Mr. M\u0027Buffer; but if so her Majesty\u0027s trust would seem to have been somewhat misplaced, as Mr. M\u0027Buffer, having been a managing director of a bankrupt swindle, from which he had contrived to pillage some thirty or forty thousand pounds, was now unable to show his face at Tillietudlem, or in the House of Commons; and in thus retreating from his membership had no object but to save himself from the expulsion which he feared. It was, however, a consolation for him to think that in what he had done the bulwarks of the British constitution had been preserved. It was an anxious moment for Undy. The existing Parliament had still a year and a half, or possibly two years and a half, to run. He had already been withdrawn from the public eye longer than he thought was suitable to the success of his career. He particularly disliked obscurity for he had found that in his case obscurity had meant comparative poverty. An obscure man, as he observed early in life, had nothing to sell. Now, Undy had once had something to sell, and a very good market he had made of it. He was of course anxious that those halcyon days should return. Fond of him as the electors of Tillietudlem no doubt were, devoted as they might be in a general way to his interests still, still it was possible that they might forget him, if he remained too long away from their embraces. \u0027Out of sight out of mind\u0027 is a proverb which opens to us the worst side of human nature. But even at Tillietudlem nature\u0027s worst side might sometimes show itself. Actuated by such feelings as these, Undy heard with joy the tidings of M\u0027Buffer\u0027s stewardship, and determined to rush to the battle at once. Battle he knew there must be. To be brought in for the district of Tillietudlem was a prize which had never yet fallen to any man\u0027s lot without a contest. Tillietudlem was no poor pocket borough to be disposed of, this way or that way, according to the caprice or venal call of some aristocrat. The men of Tillietudlem knew the value of their votes, and would only give them according to their consciences. The way to win these consciences, to overcome the sensitive doubts of a free and independent Tillietudlem elector, Undy knew to his cost. It was almost a question, as he once told Alaric, whether all that he could sell was worth all that he was compelled to buy. But having put his neck to the collar in this line of life, he was not now going to withdraw. Tillietudlem was once more vacant, and Undy determined to try it again, undaunted by former outlays. To make an outlay, however, at any rate, in electioneering matters, it is necessary that a man should have in hand some ready cash; at the present moment Undy had very little, and therefore the news of Mr. M\u0027Buffer\u0027s retirement to the German baths for his health was not heard with unalloyed delight. He first went into the city, as men always do when they want money; though in what portion of the city they find it, has never come to the author\u0027s knowledge. Charley Tudor, to be sure, did get ?5 by going to the \u0027Banks of Jordan;\u0027 but the supply likely to be derived from such a fountain as that would hardly be sufficient for Undy\u0027s wants. Having done what he could in the city, he came to Alaric, and prayed for the assistance of all his friend\u0027s energies in the matter. Alaric would not have been, and was not unwilling to assist him to the extent of his own immediate means; but his own immediate means were limited, and Undy\u0027s desire for ready cash was almost unlimited. There was a certain railway or proposed railway in Ireland, in which Undy had ventured very deeply, more so indeed than he had deemed it quite prudent to divulge to his friend; and in order to gain certain ends he had induced Alaric to become a director of this line. The line in question was the Great West Cork, which was to run from Skibbereen to Bantry, and the momentous question now hotly debated before the Railway Board was on the moot point of a branch to Ballydehob. If Undy could carry the West Cork and Ballydehob branch entire, he would make a pretty thing of it; but if, as there was too much reason to fear, his Irish foes should prevail, and leave—as Undy had once said in an eloquent speech at a very influential meeting of shareholders—and leave the unfortunate agricultural and commercial interest of Ballydehob steeped in Cimmerian darkness, the chances were that poor Undy would be well nigh ruined. Such being the case, he had striven, not unsuccessfully, to draw Alaric into the concern. Alaric had bought very cheaply a good many shares, which many people said were worth nothing, and had, by dint of Undy\u0027s machinations, been chosen a director on the board. Undy himself meanwhile lay by, hoping that fortune might restore him to Parliament, and haply put him on that committee which must finally adjudicate as to the great question of the Ballydehob branch. Such were the circumstances under which he came to Alaric with the view of raising such a sum of money as might enable him to overcome the scruples of the Tillietudlem electors, and place himself in the shoes lately vacated by Mr. M\u0027Buffer. They were sitting together after dinner when he commenced the subject. He and Mrs. Val and Clementina had done the Tudors the honour of dining with them; and the ladies had now gone up into the drawing-room, and were busy talking over the Chiswick affair, which was to come off in the next week, and after which Mrs. Val intended to give a small evening party to the most 閘ite of her acquaintance. \u0027We won\u0027t have all the world, my dear,\u0027 she had said to Gertrude, \u0027but just a few of our own set that are really nice. Clementina is dying to try that new back step with M. Jaqu阾an鄍e, so we won\u0027t crowd the room.\u0027 Such were the immediate arrangements of the Tudor and Scott party. \u0027So M\u0027Buffer is off at last,\u0027 said Scott, as he seated himself and filled his glass, after closing the dining-room door. \u0027He brought his pigs to a bad market after all.\u0027 \u0027He was an infernal rogue,\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027Well, I suppose he was,\u0027 said Undy; \u0027and a fool into the bargain to be found out.\u0027 \u0027He was a downright swindler,\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027After all,\u0027 said the other, not paying much attention to Alaric\u0027s indignation, \u0027he did not do so very badly. Why, M\u0027Buffer has been at it now for thirteen years. He began with nothing; he had neither blood nor money; and God knows he had no social merits to recommend him. He is as vulgar as a hog, as awkward as an elephant, and as ugly as an ape. I believe he never had a friend, and was known at his club to be the greatest bore that ever came out of Scotland; and yet for thirteen years he has lived on the fat of the land; for five years he has been in Parliament, his wife has gone about in her carriage, and every man in the city has been willing to shake hands with him.\u0027 \u0027And what has it all come to?\u0027 said Alaric, whom the question of M\u0027Buffer\u0027s temporary prosperity made rather thoughtful. \u0027Well, not so bad either; he has had his fling for thirteen years, and that\u0027s something. Thirteen good years out of a man\u0027s life is more than falls to the lot of every one. And then, I suppose, he has saved something.\u0027 \u0027And he is spoken of everywhere as a monster for whom hanging is too good.\u0027 \u0027Pshaw! that won\u0027t hang him. Yesterday he was a god; to-day he is a devil; to-morrow he\u0027ll be a man again; that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027But you don\u0027t mean to tell me, Undy, that the consciousness of such crimes as those which M\u0027Buffer has committed must not make a man wretched in this world, and probably in the next also?\u0027 \u0027Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,\u0027 said Undy, quoting Scripture as the devil did before him; \u0027and as for consciousness of crime, I suppose M\u0027Buffer has none at all. I have no doubt he thinks himself quite as honest as the rest of the world. He firmly believes that all of us are playing the same game, and using the same means, and has no idea whatever that dishonesty is objectionable.\u0027 \u0027And you, what do you think about it yourself?\u0027 \u0027I think the greatest rogues are they who talk most of their honesty; and, therefore, as I wish to be thought honest myself, I never talk of my own.\u0027 They both sat silent for a while, Undy bethinking himself what arguments would be most efficacious towards inducing Alaric to strip himself of every available shilling that he had; and Alaric debating in his own mind that great question which he so often debated, as to whether men, men of the world, the great and best men whom he saw around him, really endeavoured to be honest, or endeavoured only to seem so. Honesty was preached to him on every side; but did he, in his intercourse with the world, find men to be honest? Or did it behove him, a practical man like him, a man so determined to battle with the world as he had determined, did it behove such a one as he to be more honest than his neighbours? He also encouraged himself by that mystic word, \u0027Excelsior!\u0027 To him it was a watchword of battle, repeated morning, noon, and night. It was the prevailing idea of his life. \u0027Excelsior\u0027! Yes; how great, how grand, how all-absorbing is the idea! But what if a man may be going down, down to Tophet, and yet think the while that he is scaling the walls of heaven? \u0027But you wish to think yourself honest,\u0027 he said, disturbing Undy just as that hero had determined on the way in which he would play his present hand of cards. \u0027I have not the slightest difficulty about that,\u0027 said Undy; \u0027and I dare say you have none either. But as to M\u0027Buffer, his going will be a great thing for us, if, as I don\u0027t doubt, I can get his seat.\u0027 \u0027It will be a great thing for you,\u0027 said Alaric, who, as well as Undy, had his Parliamentary ambition. \u0027And for you too, my boy. We should carry the Ballydehob branch to a dead certainty; and even if we did not do that, we\u0027d bring it so near it that the expectation of it would send the shares up like mercury in fine weather. They are at ?2 12s. 6d. now, and, if I am in the House next Session, they\u0027ll be up to ?7 10s. before Easter; and what\u0027s more, my dear fellow, if we can\u0027t help ourselves in that way, they\u0027ll be worth nothing in a very few months.\u0027 Alaric looked rather blank; for he had invested deeply in this line, of which he was now a director, of a week\u0027s standing, or perhaps we should say sitting. He had sold out all his golden hopes in the Wheal Mary Jane for the sake of embarking his money and becoming a director in this Irish Railway, and in one other speculation nearer home, of which Undy had a great opinion, viz.: the Limehouse Thames Bridge Company. Such being the case, he did not like to hear the West Cork with the Ballydehob branch spoken of so slightingly. \u0027The fact is, a man can do anything if he is in the House, and he can do nothing if he is not,\u0027 said Undy. \u0027You know our old Aberdeen saying, \u0027You scratch me and I\u0027ll scratch you.\u0027 It is not only what a man may do himself for himself, but it is what others will do for him when he is in a position to help them. Now, there are those fellows; I am hand-and-glove with all of them; but there is not one of them would lift a finger to help me as I am now; but let me get my seat again, and they\u0027ll do for me just anything I ask them. Vigil moves the new writ to-night; I got a line from him asking me whether I was ready. There was no good to be got by waiting, so I told him to fire away.\u0027 \u0027I suppose you\u0027ll go down at once?\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027Well, that as may be—at least, yes; that\u0027s my intention. But there\u0027s one thing needful—and that is the needful.\u0027 \u0027Money?\u0027 suggested Alaric. \u0027Yes, money—cash—rhino—tin—ready—or by what other name the goddess would be pleased to have herself worshipped; money, sir; there\u0027s the difficulty, now as ever. Even at Tillietudlem money will have its weight.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t your father assist you?\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027My father! I wonder how he\u0027d look if he got a letter from me asking for money. You might as well expect a goose to feed her young with blood out of her own breast, like a pelican, as expect that a Scotch lord should give money to his younger sons like an English duke. What would my father get by my being member for Tillietudlem? No; I must look nearer home than my father. What can you do for me?\u0027 \u0027I?\u0027 \u0027Yes, you,\u0027 said Undy; \u0027I am sure you don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027ll refuse to lend me a helping hand if you can. I must realize by the Ballydehobs, if I am once in the House; and then you\u0027d have your money back at once.\u0027 \u0027It is not that,\u0027 said Alaric; \u0027but I haven\u0027t got it.\u0027 \u0027I am sure you could let me have a thousand or so,\u0027 said Undy. \u0027I think a couple of thousand would carry it, and I could make out the other myself.\u0027 \u0027Every shilling I have,\u0027 said Alaric, \u0027is either in the Ballydehobs or in the Limehouse Bridge. Why don\u0027t you sell yourself?\u0027 \u0027So I have,\u0027 said Undy; \u0027everything that I can without utter ruin. The Ballydehobs are not saleable, as you know.\u0027 \u0027What can I do for you, then?\u0027 Undy set himself again to think. \u0027I have no doubt I could get a thousand on our joint names. That blackguard, M\u0027Ruen, would do it.\u0027 \u0027Who is M\u0027Ruen?\u0027 asked Alaric. \u0027A low blackguard of a discounting Jew Christian. He would do it; but then, heaven knows what he would charge, and he\u0027d make so many difficulties that I shouldn\u0027t have the money for the next fortnight.\u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have my name on a bill in such a man\u0027s hands on any account,\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t like it myself,\u0027 said Undy; \u0027but what the deuce am I to do? I might as well go to Tillietudlem without my head as without money.\u0027 \u0027I thought you\u0027d kept a lot of the Mary Janes,\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027So I had, but they\u0027re gone now. I tell you I\u0027ve managed ?1,000 myself. It would murder me now if the seat were to go into other hands. I\u0027d get the Committee on the Limehouse Bridge, and we should treble our money. Vigil told me he would not refuse the Committee, though of course the Government won\u0027t consent to a grant if they can help it.\u0027 \u0027Well, Undy, I can let you have ?250, and that is every shilling I have at my banker\u0027s.\u0027 \u0027They would not let you overdraw a few hundreds?\u0027 suggested Undy. \u0027I certainly shall not try them,\u0027 said Alaric. \u0027You are so full of scruple, so green, so young,\u0027 said Undy, almost in an enthusiasm of remonstrance. \u0027What can be the harm of trying them?\u0027 \u0027My credit.\u0027 \u0027Fal lal. What\u0027s the meaning of credit? How are you to know whether you have got any credit if you don\u0027t try? Come, I\u0027ll tell you how you can do it. Old Cuttwater would lend it you for the asking.\u0027 To this proposition Alaric at first turned a deaf ear; but by degrees he allowed Undy to talk him over. Undy showed him that if he lost the Tillietudlem burghs on this occasion it would be useless for him to attempt to stand for them again. In such case, he would have no alternative at the next general election but to stand for the borough of Strathbogy in Aberdeenshire; whereas, if he could secure Tillietudlem as a seat for himself, all the Gaberlunzie interest in the borough of Strathbogy, which was supposed to be by no means small, should be transferred to Alaric himself. Indeed, Sandie Scott, the eldest hope of the Gaberlunzie family, would, in such case, himself propose Alaric to the electors. Ca\u0027stalk Cottage, in which the Hon. Sandie lived, and which was on the outskirts of the Gaberlunzie property, was absolutely within the boundary of the borough. Overcome by these and other arguments, Alaric at last consented to ask from Captain Cuttwater the loan of ?700. That sum Undy had agreed to accept as a sufficient contribution to that desirable public object, the re-seating himself for the Tillietudlem borough, and as Alaric on reflection thought that it would be uncomfortable to be left penniless himself, and as it was just as likely that Uncle Bat would lend him ?700 as ?500, he determined to ask for a loan of the entire sum. He accordingly did so, and the letter, as we have seen, reached the captain while Harry and Charley were at Surbiton Cottage. The old gentleman was anything but pleased. In the first place he liked his money, though not with any overweening affection; in the next place, he had done a great deal for Alaric, and did not like being asked to do more; and lastly, he feared that there must be some evil cause for the necessity of such a loan so soon after Alaric\u0027s marriage. Alaric in making his application had not done so actually without making any explanation on the subject. He wrote a long letter, worded very cleverly, which only served to mystify the captain, as Alaric had intended that it should do. Captain Cuttwater was most anxious that Alaric, whom he looked on as his adopted son, should rise in the world; he would have been delighted to think that he might possibly live to see him in Parliament; would probably have made considerable pecuniary sacrifice for such an object. With the design, therefore, of softening Captain Cuttwater\u0027s heart, Alaric in his letter had spoken about great changes that were coming, of the necessity that there was of his stirring himself, of the great pecuniary results to be expected from a small present expenditure; and ended by declaring that the money was to be used in forwarding the election of his friend Scott for the Tillietudlem district burghs. Now, the fact was, that Uncle Bat, though he cared a great deal for Alaric, did not care a rope\u0027s end for Undy Scott, and could enjoy his rum-punch just as keenly if Mr. Scott was in obscurity as he could possibly hope to do even if that gentleman should be promoted to be a Lord of the Treasury. He was not at all pleased to think that his hard-earned moidores should run down the gullies of the Tillietudlem boroughs in the shape of muddy ale or vitriolic whisky; and yet this was the first request that Alaric had ever made to him, and he did not like to refuse Alaric\u0027s first request. So he came up to town himself on the following morning with Harry and Charley, determined to reconcile all these difficulties by the light of his own wisdom. In the evening he returned to Surbiton Cottage, having been into the city, sold out stock for ?700, and handed over the money to Alaric Tudor. On the following morning Undy Scott set out for Scotland, properly freighted, Mr. Whip Vigil having in due course moved for a new writ for the Tillietudlem borough in the place of Mr. M\u0027Buffer, who had accepted the situation of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748/75748.html","bookId":1354,"book":{"id":1354,"title":"The Three Clerks","description":"简介： There is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction, and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree in Kensington Gardens of a summer day...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
