{"id":39351,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. — SURBITON COLLOQUIES","content":"All further conversation in the drawing-room was forbidden for that night. Mrs. Woodward would have willingly postponed the reading of Charley\u0027s story so as to enable Katie to go to bed after the accident, had she been able to do so. But she was not able to do so without an exercise of a species of authority which was distasteful to her, and which was very seldom heard, seen, or felt within the limits of Surbiton Cottage. It would moreover have been very ungracious to snub Charley\u0027s manuscript, just when Charley had made himself such a hero; and she had, therefore, been obliged to read it. But now that it was done, she hurried Katie off to bed, not without many admonitions. \u0027Good night,\u0027 she said to Charley; \u0027and God bless you, and make you always as happy as we are now. What a household we should have had to-night, had it not been for you!\u0027 Charley rubbed his eyes with his hand, and muttered something about there not having been the slightest danger in the world. \u0027And remember, Charley,\u0027 she said, paying no attention to his mutterings, \u0027we always liked you—liked you very much; but liking and loving are very different things. Now you are a dear, dear friend—one of the dearest.\u0027 In answer to this, Charley was not even able to mutter; so he went his way to the inn, and lay awake half the night thinking how Katie had kissed his hand: during the other half he dreamt, first that Katie was drowned, and then that Norah was his bride. Linda and Katie had been so hurried off, that they had only been just able to shake hands with Harry and Charley. There is, however, an old proverb, that though one man may lead a horse to water, a thousand cannot make him drink. It was easy to send Katie to bed, but very difficult to prevent her talking when she was there. \u0027Oh, Linda,\u0027 she said, \u0027what can I do for him?\u0027 \u0027Do for him?\u0027 said Linda; \u0027I don\u0027t know that you can do anything for him. I don\u0027t suppose he wants you to do anything.\u0027 Linda still looked on her sister as a child; but Katie was beginning to put away childish things. \u0027Couldn\u0027t I make something for him, Linda—something for him to keep as a present, you know? I would work so hard to get it done.\u0027 \u0027Work a pair of slippers, as Crinoline did,\u0027 said Linda. Katie was brushing her hair at the moment, and then she sat still with the brush in her hand, thinking. \u0027No,\u0027 said she, after a while, \u0027not a pair of slippers—I shouldn\u0027t like a pair of slippers.\u0027 \u0027Why not?\u0027 said Linda. \u0027Oh—I don\u0027t know—but I shouldn\u0027t.\u0027 Katie had said that Crinoline was working slippers for Macassar because she was in love with him; and having said so, she could not now work slippers for Charley. Poor Katie! she was no longer a child when she thought thus. \u0027Then make him a purse,\u0027 said Linda. \u0027A purse is such a little thing.\u0027 \u0027Then work him the cover for a sofa, like what mamma and I are doing for Gertrude.\u0027 \u0027But he hasn\u0027t got a house,\u0027 said Katie. \u0027He\u0027ll have a house by the time you\u0027ve done the sofa, and a wife to sit on it too.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Linda, you are so ill-natured.\u0027 \u0027Why, child, what do you want me to say? If you were to give him one of those grand long tobacco pipes they have in the shop windows, that\u0027s what he\u0027d like the best; or something of that sort. I don\u0027t think he cares much for girls\u0027 presents, such as purses and slippers.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t he?\u0027 said Katie, mournfully. \u0027No; not a bit. You know he\u0027s such a rake.\u0027 \u0027Oh! Linda; I don\u0027t think he\u0027s so very bad, indeed I don\u0027t; and mamma doesn\u0027t think so; and you know Harry said on Easter Sunday that he was much better than he used to be.\u0027 \u0027I know Harry is very good-natured to him.\u0027 \u0027And isn\u0027t Charley just as good-natured to Harry? I am quite sure he is. Harry has only to ask the least thing, and Charley always does it. Do you remember how Charley went up to town for him the Sunday before last?\u0027 \u0027And so he ought,\u0027 said Linda. \u0027He ought to do whatever Harry tells him.\u0027 \u0027Well, Linda, I don\u0027t know why he ought,\u0027 said Katie. \u0027They are not brothers, you know, nor yet even cousins.\u0027 \u0027But Harry is very—so very—so very superior, you know,\u0027 said Linda. \u0027I don\u0027t know any such thing,\u0027 said Katie. \u0027Oh! Katie, don\u0027t you know that Charley is such a rake?\u0027 \u0027But rakes are just the people who don\u0027t do whatever they are told; so that\u0027s no reason. And I am quite sure that Charley is much the cleverer.\u0027 \u0027And I am quite sure he is not—nor half so clever; nor nearly so well educated. Why, don\u0027t you know the navvies are the most ignorant young men in London? Charley says so himself.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s his fun,\u0027 said Katie: \u0027besides, he always makes little of himself. I am quite sure Harry could never have made all that about Macassar and Crinoline out of his own head.\u0027 \u0027No! because he doesn\u0027t think of such nonsensical things. I declare, Miss Katie, I think you are in love with Master Charley.\u0027 Katie, who was still sitting at the dressing-table, blushed up to her forehead; and at the same time her eyes were suffused with tears. But there was no one to see either of those tell-tale symptoms, for Linda was in bed. \u0027I know he saved my life,\u0027 said Katie, as soon as she could trust herself to speak without betraying her emotion—\u0027I know he jumped into the river after me, and very, very nearly drowned himself; and I don\u0027t think any other man in the world would have done so much for me besides him.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Katie! Harry would in a moment.\u0027 \u0027Not for me; perhaps he might for you—though I\u0027m not quite sure that he would.\u0027 It was thus that Katie took her revenge on her sister. \u0027I\u0027m quite sure he would for anybody, even for Sally.\u0027 Sally was an assistant in the back kitchen. \u0027But I don\u0027t mean to say, Katie, that you shouldn\u0027t feel grateful to Charley; of course you should.\u0027 \u0027And so I do,\u0027 said Katie, now bursting out into tears, overdone by her emotion and fatigue; \u0027and so I do—and I do love him, and will love him, if he\u0027s ever so much a rake! But you know, Linda, that is very different from being in love; and it was very ill-natured of you to say so, very.\u0027 Linda was out of bed in a trice, and sitting with her arm round her sister\u0027s neck. \u0027Why, you darling little foolish child, you! I was only quizzing,\u0027 said she. \u0027Don\u0027t you know that I love Charley too?\u0027 \u0027But you shouldn\u0027t quiz about such a thing as that. If you\u0027d fallen into the river, and Harry had pulled you out, then you\u0027d know what I mean; but I\u0027m not at all sure that he could have done it.\u0027 Katie\u0027s perverse wickedness on this point was very nearly giving rise to another contest between the sisters. Linda\u0027s common sense, however, prevailed, and giving up the point of Harry\u0027s prowess, she succeeded at last in getting Katie into bed. \u0027You know mamma will be so angry if she hears us,\u0027 said Linda, \u0027and I am sure you will be ill to-morrow.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t care a bit about being ill to-tomorrow; and yet I do too,\u0027 she added, after a pause, \u0027for it\u0027s Sunday. It would be so stupid not to be able to go out to-morrow.\u0027 \u0027Well, then, try to go to sleep at once\u0027—and Linda carefully tucked the clothes around her sister. \u0027I think it shall be a purse,\u0027 said Katie. \u0027A purse will certainly be the best; that is, if you don\u0027t like the slippers,\u0027 and Linda rolled herself up comfortably in the bed. \u0027No—I don\u0027t like the slippers at all. It shall be a purse. I can do that the quickest, you know. It\u0027s so stupid to give a thing when everything about it is forgotten, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Very stupid,\u0027 said Linda, nearly asleep. \u0027And when it\u0027s worn out I can make another, can\u0027t I?\u0027 \u0027H\u0027m\u0027m\u0027m,\u0027 said Linda, quite asleep. And then Katie went asleep also, in her sister\u0027s arms. Early in the morning—that is to say, not very early, perhaps between seven and eight—Mrs. Woodward came into their room, and having inspected her charges, desired that Katie should not get up for morning church, but lie in bed till the middle of the day. \u0027Oh, mamma, it will be so stupid not going to church after tumbling into the river; people will say that all my clothes are wet.\u0027 \u0027People will about tell the truth as to some of them,\u0027 said Mrs. Woodward; \u0027but don\u0027t you mind about people, but lie still and go to sleep if you can. Linda, do you come and dress in my room.\u0027 \u0027And is Charley to lie in bed too?\u0027 said Katie. \u0027He was in the river longer than I was.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s too late to keep Charley in bed,\u0027 said Linda, \u0027for I see him coming along the road now with a towel; he\u0027s been bathing.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I do so wish I could go and bathe,\u0027 said Katie. Poor Katie was kept in bed till the afternoon. Charley and Harry, however, were allowed to come up to her bedroom door, and hear her pronounce herself quite well. \u0027How d\u0027ye do, Mr. Macassar?\u0027 said she. \u0027And how d\u0027ye do, my Lady Crinoline?\u0027 said Harry. After that Katie never called Charley Mr. Macassar again. They all went to church, and Katie was left to sleep or read, or think of the new purse that she was to make, as best she might. And then they dined, and then they walked out; but still without Katie. She was to get up and dress while they were out, so as to receive them in state in the drawing-room on their return. Four of them walked together; for Uncle Bat now usually took himself off to his friend at Hampton Court on Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Woodward walked with Charley, and Harry and Linda paired together. \u0027Now,\u0027 said Charley to himself, \u0027now would have been the time to have told Mrs. Woodward everything, but for that accident of yesterday. Now I can tell her nothing; to do so now would be to demand her sympathy and to ask for assistance;\u0027 and so he determined to tell her nothing. But the very cause which made Charley dumb on the subject of his own distresses made Mrs. Woodward inquisitive about them. She knew that his life was not like that of Harry—steady, sober, and discreet; but she felt that she did not like him, or even love him the less on this account. Nay, it was not clear to her that these failings of his did not give him additional claims on her sympathies. What could she do for him? how could she relieve him? how could she bring him back to the right way? She spoke to him of his London life, praised his talents, encouraged him to exertion, besought him to have some solicitude, and, above all, some respect for himself. And then, with that delicacy which such a woman, and none but such a woman, can use in such a matter, she asked him whether he was still in debt. Charley, with shame we must own it, had on this subject been false to all his friends. He had been false to his father and his mother, and had never owned to them the half of what he owed; he had been false to Alaric, and false to Harry; but now, now, at such a moment as this, he would not allow himself to be false to Mrs. Woodward. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027he was in debt—rather.\u0027 Mrs. Woodward pressed him to say whether his debts were heavy—whether he owed much. \u0027It\u0027s no use thinking of it, Mrs. Woodward,\u0027 said he; \u0027not the least. I know I ought not to come down here; and I don\u0027t think I will any more.\u0027 \u0027Not come down here!\u0027 said Mrs. Woodward. \u0027Why not? There\u0027s very little expense in that. I dare say you\u0027d spend quite as much in London.\u0027 \u0027Oh—of course—three times as much, perhaps; that is, if I had it—but I don\u0027t mean that.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 said she. Charley walked on in silence, with melancholy look, very crestfallen, his thumbs stuck into his waistcoat pockets. \u0027Upon my word I don\u0027t know what you mean,\u0027 said Mrs. Woodward. \u0027I should have thought coming to Hampton might perhaps—perhaps have kept you—I don\u0027t exactly mean out of mischief.\u0027 That, however, in spite of her denial, was exactly what Mrs. Woodward did mean. \u0027So it does—but—\u0027 said Charley, now thoroughly ashamed of himself. \u0027But what?\u0027 said she. \u0027I am not fit to be here,\u0027 said Charley; and as he spoke his manly self-control all gave way, and big tears rolled down his cheeks. Mrs. Woodward, in her woman\u0027s heart, resolved, that if it might in any way be possible, she would make him fit, fit not only to be there, but to hold his head up with the best in any company in which he might find himself. She questioned him no further then. Her wish now was not to torment him further, but to comfort him. She determined that she would consult with Harry and with her uncle, and take counsel from them as to what steps might be taken to save the brand from the burning. She talked to him as a mother might have done, leaning on his arm, as she returned; leaning on him as a woman never leans on a man whom she deems unfit for her society. All this Charley\u0027s heart and instinct fully understood, and he was not ungrateful. But yet he had but little to comfort him. He must return to town on Monday; return to Mr. Snape and the lock entries, to Mr. M\u0027Ruen and the three Seasons—to Mrs. Davis, Norah Geraghty, and that horrid Mr. Peppermint. He never once thought of Clementina Golightly, to whom at that moment he was being married by the joint energies of Undy Scott and his cousin Alaric. And what had Linda and Norman been doing all this time? Had they been placing mutual confidence in each other? No; they had not come to that yet. Linda still remembered the pang with which she had first heard of Gertrude\u0027s engagement, and Harry Norman had not yet been able to open his seared heart to a second love. In the course of the evening a letter was brought to Captain Cuttwater, which did not seem to raise his spirits. \u0027Whom is your letter from, uncle?\u0027 said Mrs. Woodward. \u0027From Alaric,\u0027 said he, gruffly, crumpling it up and putting it into his pocket. And then he turned to his rum and water in a manner that showed his determination to say nothing more on the matter. In the morning Harry and Charley returned to town. Captain Cuttwater went up with them; and all was again quiet at Surbiton Cottage.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748/75747.html","bookId":1354,"book":{"id":1354,"title":"The Three Clerks","description":"简介： There is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction, and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree in Kensington Gardens of a summer day...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
