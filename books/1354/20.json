{"id":39346,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. — A DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES.—MORNING","content":"On the morning after this conversation with Alaric, Charley left his lodgings with a heavy heart, and wended his way towards Mecklenburg Square. At the corner of Davies Street he got an omnibus, which for fourpence took him to one of the little alleys near Gray\u0027s Inn, and there he got down, and threading the well-known locality, through Bedford Place and across Theobald\u0027s Road, soon found himself at the door of his generous patron. Oh! how he hated the house; how he hated the blear-eyed, cross-grained, dirty, impudent fish-fag of an old woman who opened the door for him; how he hated Mr. Jabesh M\u0027Ruen, to whom he now came a supplicant for assistance, and how, above all, he hated himself for being there. He was shown into Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s little front parlour, where he had to wait for fifteen minutes, while his patron made such a breakfast as generally falls to the lot of such men. We can imagine the rancid butter, the stale befingered bread, the ha\u0027porth of sky-blue milk, the tea innocent of China\u0027s wrongs, and the soiled cloth. Mr. M\u0027Ruen always did keep Charley waiting fifteen minutes, and so he was no whit surprised; the doing so was a part of the tremendous interest which the wretched old usurer received for his driblets of money. There was not a bit of furniture in the room on which Charley had not speculated till speculation could go no further; the old escritoire or secr閠aire which Mr. M\u0027Ruen always opened the moment he came into the room; the rickety Pembroke table, covered with dirty papers which stood in the middle of it; the horsehair-bottomed chairs, on which Charley declined to sit down, unless he had on his thickest winter trousers, so perpendicular had become some atoms on the surface, which, when new, had no doubt been horizontal; the ornaments (!) on the chimney, broken bits of filthy crockery, full of wisps of paper, with a china duck without a tail, and a dog to correspond without a head; the pictures against the wall, with their tarnished dingy frames and cracked glasses, representing three of the Seasons; how the fourth had gone before its time to its final bourne by an unhappy chance, Mr. M\u0027Ruen had once explained to Charley, while endeavouring to make his young customer take the other three as a good value for ?7 10s. in arranging a little transaction, the total amount of which did not exceed ?15. In that instance, however, Charley, who had already dabbled somewhat deeply in dressing-cases, utterly refused to trade in the articles produced. Charley stood with his back to the dog and duck, facing Winter, with Spring on his right and Autumn on his left; it was well that Summer was gone, no summer could have shed light on that miserable chamber. He knew that he would have to wait, and was not therefore impatient, and at the end of fifteen minutes Mr. M\u0027Ruen shuffled into the room in his slippers. He was a little man, with thin grey hair, which stood upright from his narrow head—what his age might have been it was impossible to guess; he was wizened, and dry, and grey, but still active enough on his legs when he had exchanged his slippers for his shoes; and as keen in all his senses as though years could never tell upon him. He always wore round his neck a stiff-starched deep white handkerchief, not fastened with a bow in front, the ends being tucked in so as to be invisible. This cravat not only covered his throat but his chin also, so that his head seemed to grow forth from it without the aid of any neck; and he had a trick of turning his face round within it, an inch or two to the right or to the left, in a manner which seemed to indicate that his cranium was loose and might be removed at pleasure. He shuffled into the room where Charley was standing with little short quick steps, and putting out his hand, just touched that of his customer, by way of going through the usual process of greeting. Some short statement must be made of Charley\u0027s money dealings with Mr. M\u0027Ruen up to this period. About two years back a tailor had an over-due bill of his for ?20, of which he was unable to obtain payment, and being unwilling to go to law, or perhaps being himself in Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s power, he passed this bill to that worthy gentleman—what amount of consideration he got for it, it matters not now to inquire; Mr. M\u0027Ruen very shortly afterwards presented himself at the Internal Navigation, and introduced himself to our hero. He did this with none of the overbearing harshness of the ordinary dun, or the short caustic decision of a creditor determined to resort to the utmost severity of the law. He turned his head about and smiled, and just showed the end of the bill peeping out from among a parcel of others, begged Mr. Tudor to be punctual, he would only ask him to be punctual, and would in such case do anything for him, and ended his visit by making an appointment to meet Charley in the little street behind Mecklenburg Square. Charley kept his appointment, and came away from Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s with a well-contented mind. He had, it is true, left ?5 behind him, and had also left the bill, still entire; but he had obtained a promise of unlimited assistance from the good-natured gentleman, and had also received instructions how he was to get a brother clerk to draw a bill, how he was to accept it himself, and how his patron was to discount it for him, paying him real gold out of the Bank of England in exchange for his worthless signature. Charley stepped lighter on the ground as he left Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s house on that eventful morning than he had done for many a day. There was something delightful in the feeling that he could make money of his name in this way, as great bankers do of theirs, by putting it at the bottom of a scrap of paper. He experienced a sort of pride too in having achieved so respectable a position in the race of ruin which he was running, as to have dealings with a bill-discounter. He felt that he was putting himself on a par with great men, and rising above the low level of the infernal navvies. Mr. M\u0027Ruen had pulled the bill out of a heap of bills which he always carried in his huge pocket-book, and showed to Charley the name of an impoverished Irish peer on the back of it; and the sight of that name had made Charley quite in love with rum. He already felt that he was almost hand-and-glove with Lord Mount-Coffeehouse; for it was a descendant of the nobleman so celebrated in song. \u0027Only be punctual, Mr. Tudor; only be punctual, and I will do anything for you,\u0027 Mr. M\u0027Ruen had said, as Charley left the house. Charley, however, never had been punctual, and yet his dealings with Mr. M\u0027Ruen had gone on from that day to this. What absolute money he had ever received into his hand he could not now have said, but it was very little, probably not amounting in all to ?50. Yet he had already paid during the two years more than double that sum to this sharp-clawed vulture, and still owed him the amounts of more bills than he could number. Indeed he had kept no account of these double-fanged little documents; he had signed them whenever told to do so, and had even been so preposterously foolish as to sign them in blank. All he knew was that at the beginning of every quarter Mr. M\u0027Ruen got nearly the half of his little modicum of salary, and that towards the middle of it he usually contrived to obtain an advance of some small, some very small sum, and that when doing so he always put his hand to a fresh bit of paper. He was beginning to be heartily sick of the bill-discounter. His intimacy with the lord had not yet commenced, nor had he experienced any of the delights which he had expected to accrue to him from the higher tone of extravagance in which he entered when he made Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s acquaintance. And then the horrid fatal waste of time which he incurred in pursuit of the few pounds which he occasionally obtained, filled even his heart with a sort of despair. Morning after morning he would wait in that hated room; and then day after day, at two o\u0027clock, he would attend the usurer\u0027s city haunt—and generally all in vain. The patience of Mr. Snape was giving way, and the discipline even of the Internal Navigation felt itself outraged. And now Charley stood once more in that dingy little front parlour in which he had never yet seen a fire, and once more Mr. Jabesh M\u0027Ruen shuffled into the room in his big cravat and dirty loose slippers. \u0027How d\u0027ye do, Mr. Tudor, how d\u0027ye do? I hope you have brought a little of this with you;\u0027 and Jabesh opened out his left hand, and tapped the palm of it with the middle finger of his right, by way of showing that he expected some money: not that he did expect any, cormorant that he was; this was not the period of the quarter in which he ever got money from his customer. \u0027Indeed I have not, Mr. M\u0027Ruen; but I positively must get some.\u0027 \u0027Oh—oh—oh—oh—Mr. Tudor—Mr. Tudor! How can we go on if you are so unpunctual? Now I would do anything for you if you would only be punctual.\u0027 \u0027Oh! bother about that—you know your own game well enough.\u0027 \u0027Be punctual, Mr. Tudor, only be punctual, and we shall be all right—and so you have not got any of this?\u0027 and Jabesh went through the tapping again. \u0027Not a doit,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027but I shall be up the spout altogether if you don\u0027t do something to help me.\u0027 \u0027But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor.\u0027 \u0027Oh, d—— it; you\u0027ll make me sick if you say that again. What else do you live by but that? But I positively must have some money from you to-day. If not I am done for.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think I can, Mr. Tudor; not to-day, Mr. Tudor—some other day, say this day month; that is, if you\u0027ll be punctual.\u0027 \u0027This day month! no, but this very day, Mr. M\u0027Ruen—why, you got ?18 from me when I received my last salary, and I have not had a shilling back since.\u0027 \u0027But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 and Jabesh twisted his head backwards and forwards within his cravat, rubbing his chin with the interior starch. \u0027Well, then, I\u0027ll tell you what it is,\u0027 said Charley, \u0027I\u0027ll be shot if you get a shilling from me on the 1st of October, and you may sell me up as quick as you please. If I don\u0027t give a history of your business that will surprise some people, my name isn\u0027t Tudor.\u0027 \u0027Ha, ha, ha!\u0027 laughed Mr. M\u0027Ruen, with a soft quiet laugh. \u0027Well, really, Mr. Tudor, I would do more for you than any other young man that I know, if you were only a little more punctual. How much is it you want now?\u0027 \u0027?15—or ?10—?10 will do.\u0027 \u0027Ten pounds!\u0027 said Jabesh, as though Charley had asked for ten thousand—\u0027ten pounds!—if two or three would do—\u0027 \u0027But two or three won\u0027t do.\u0027 \u0027And whose name will you bring?\u0027 \u0027Whose name! why Scatterall\u0027s, to be sure.\u0027 Now Scatterall was one of the navvies; and from him Mr. M\u0027Ruen had not yet succeeded in extracting one farthing, though he had his name on a volume of Charley\u0027s bills. \u0027Scatterall—I don\u0027t like Mr. Scatterall,\u0027 said Jabesh; \u0027he is very dissipated, and the most unpunctual young man I ever met—you really must get some one else, Mr. Tudor; you really must.\u0027 \u0027Oh, that\u0027s nonsense—Scatterall is as good as anybody—I couldn\u0027t ask any of the other fellows—they are such a low set.\u0027 \u0027But Mr. Scatterall is so unpunctual. There\u0027s your cousin, Mr. Alaric Tudor.\u0027 \u0027My cousin Alaric! Oh, nonsense! you don\u0027t suppose I\u0027d ask him to do such a thing? You might as well tell me to go to my father.\u0027 \u0027Or that other gentleman you live with; Mr. Norman. He is a most punctual gentleman. Bring me his name, and I\u0027ll let you have ?10 or ?8—I\u0027ll let you have ?8 at once.\u0027 \u0027I dare say you will, Mr. M\u0027Ruen, or ?80; and be only too happy to give it me. But you know that is out of the question. Now I won\u0027t wait any longer; just give me an answer to this: if I come to you in the city will you let me have some money to-day? If you won\u0027t, why I must go elsewhere—that\u0027s all.\u0027 The interview ended by an appointment being made for another meeting to come off at two p.m. that day, at the \u0027Banks of Jordan,\u0027 a public-house in Sweeting\u0027s Alley, as well known to Charley as the little front parlour of Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s house. \u0027Bring the bill-stamp with you, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said Jabesh, by way of a last parting word of counsel; \u0027and let Mr. Scatterall sign it—that is, if it must be Mr. Scatterall; but I wish you would bring your cousin\u0027s name.\u0027 \u0027Nonsense!\u0027 \u0027Well, then, bring it signed—but I\u0027ll fill it; you young fellows understand nothing of filling in a bill properly.\u0027 And then taking his leave the infernal navvy hurried off, and reached his office in Somerset House at a quarter past eleven o\u0027clock. As he walked along he bought the bit of stamped paper on which his friend Scatterall was to write his name. When he reached the office he found that a great commotion was going on. Mr. Snape was standing up at his desk, and the first word which greeted Charley\u0027s ears was an intimation from that gentleman that Mr. Oldeschole had desired that Mr. Tudor, when he arrived, should be instructed to attend in the board-room. \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Charley, in a tone of great indifference, \u0027with all my heart; I rather like seeing Oldeschole now and then. But he mustn\u0027t keep me long, for I have to meet my grandmother at Islington at two o\u0027clock;\u0027 and Charley, having hung up his hat, prepared to walk off to the Secretary\u0027s room. \u0027You\u0027ll be good enough to wait a few minutes, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said Snape. \u0027Another gentleman is with Mr. Oldeschole at present. You will be good enough to sit down and go on with the Kennett and Avon lock entries, till Mr. Oldeschole is ready to see you.\u0027 Charley sat down at his desk opposite to his friend Scatterall. \u0027I hope, Mr. Snape, you had a pleasant meeting at evening prayers yesterday,\u0027 said he, with a tone of extreme interest. \u0027You had better mind the lock entries at present, Mr. Tudor; they are greatly in arrear.\u0027 \u0027And the evening meetings are docketed up as close as wax, I suppose. What the deuce is in the wind, Dick?\u0027 Mr. Scatterall\u0027s Christian name was Richard. \u0027Where\u0027s Corkscrew?\u0027 Mr. Corkscrew was also a navvy, and was one of those to whom Charley had specially alluded when he spoke of the low set. \u0027Oh, here\u0027s a regular go,\u0027 said Scatterall. \u0027It\u0027s all up with Corkscrew, I believe.\u0027 \u0027Why, what\u0027s the cheese now?\u0027 \u0027Oh! it\u0027s all about some pork chops, which Screwy had for supper last night.\u0027 Screwy was a name of love which among his brother navvies was given to Mr. Corkscrew. \u0027Mr. Snape seems to think they did not agree with him.\u0027 \u0027Pork chops in July!\u0027 exclaimed Charley. \u0027Poor Screwy forgot the time of year,\u0027 said another navvy; \u0027he ought to have called it lamb and grass.\u0027 And then the story was told. On the preceding afternoon, Mr. Corkscrew had been subjected to the dire temptation of a boating party to the Eel-pie Island for the following day, and a dinner thereon. There were to be at the feast no less than four-and-twenty jolly souls, and it was intimated to Mr. Corkscrew that as no soul was esteemed to be more jolly than his own, the party would be considered as very imperfect unless he could join it. Asking for a day\u0027s leave Mr. Corkscrew knew to be out of the question; he had already taken too many without asking. He was therefore driven to take another in the same way, and had to look about for some excuse which might support him in his difficulty. An excuse it must be, not only new, but very valid; one so strong that it could not be overset; one so well avouched that it could not be doubted. Accordingly, after mature consideration, he sat down after leaving his office, and wrote the following letter, before he started on an evening cruising expedition with some others of the party to prepare for the next day\u0027s festivities. \u0027Thursday morning,—July, 185-. \u0027MY DEAR SIR, \u0027I write from my bed where I am suffering a most tremendous indiggestion, last night I eat a stunning supper off pork chopps and never remembered that pork chopps always does disagree with me, but I was very indiscrete and am now teetotally unable to rise my throbing head from off my pillar, I have took four blu pills and some salts and sena, plenty of that, and shall be the thing to-morrow morning no doubt, just at present I feel just as if I had a mill stone inside my stomac—Pray be so kind as to make it all right with Mr. Oldeschole and believe me to remain, \u0027Your faithful and obedient servant, \u0027VERAX CORKSCREW. \u0027Thomas Snape, Esq., \u0026c., \u0027Internal Navigation Office, Somerset House.\u0027 Having composed this letter of excuse, and not intending to return to his lodgings that evening, he had to make provision for its safely reaching the hands of Mr. Snape in due time on the following morning. This he did, by giving it to the boy who came to clean the lodging-house boots, with sundry injunctions that if he did not deliver it at the office by ten o\u0027clock on the following morning, the sixpence accruing to him would never be paid. Mr. Corkscrew, however, said nothing as to the letter not being delivered before ten the next morning, and as other business took the boy along the Strand the same evening, he saw no reason why he should not then execute his commission. He accordingly did so, and duly delivered the letter into the hands of a servant girl, who was cleaning the passages of the office. Fortune on this occasion was blind to the merits of Mr. Corkscrew, and threw him over most unmercifully. It so happened that Mr. Snape had been summoned to an evening conference with Mr. Oldeschole and the other pundits of the office, to discuss with them, or rather to hear discussed, some measure which they began to think it necessary to introduce, for amending the discipline of the department. \u0027We are getting a bad name, whether we deserve it or not,\u0027 said Mr. Oldeschole. \u0027That fellow Hardlines has put us into his blue-book, and now there\u0027s an article in the Times!\u0027 Just at this moment, a messenger brought in to Mr. Snape the unfortunate letter of which we have given a copy. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Mr. Oldeschole. \u0027A note from Mr. Corkscrew, sir,\u0027 said Snape. \u0027He\u0027s the worst of the whole lot,\u0027 said Mr. Oldeschole. \u0027He is very bad,\u0027 said Snape; \u0027but I rather think that perhaps, sir, Mr. Tudor is the worst of all.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said the Secretary, muttering sotto voce to the Under-Secretary, while Mr. Snape read the letter—\u0027Tudor, at any rate, is a gentleman.\u0027 Mr. Snape read the letter, and his face grew very long. There was a sort of sneaking civility about Corkscrew, not prevalent indeed at all times, but which chiefly showed itself when he and Mr. Snape were alone together, which somewhat endeared him to the elder clerk. He would have screened the sinner had he had either the necessary presence of mind or the necessary pluck. But he had neither. He did not know how to account for the letter but by the truth, and he feared to conceal so flagrant a breach of discipline at the moment of the present discussion. Things at any rate so turned out that Mr. Corkscrew\u0027s letter was read in full conclave in the board-room of the office, just as he was describing the excellence of his manoeuvre with great glee to four or five other jolly souls at the \u0027Magpie and Stump.\u0027 At first it was impossible to prevent a fit of laughter, in which even Mr. Snape joined; but very shortly the laughter gave way to the serious considerations to which such an epistle was sure to give rise at such a moment. What if Sir Gregory Hardlines should get hold of it and put it into his blue-book! What if the Times should print it and send it over the whole world, accompanied by a few of its most venomous touches, to the eternal disgrace of the Internal Navigation, and probably utter annihilation of Mr. Oldeschole\u0027s official career! An example must be made! Yes, an example must be made. Messengers were sent off scouring the town for Mr. Corkscrew, and about midnight he was found, still true to the \u0027Magpie and Stump,\u0027 but hardly in condition to understand the misfortune which had befallen him. So much as this, however, did make itself manifest to him, that he must by no means join his jolly-souled brethren at the Eel-pie Island, and that he must be at his office punctually at ten o\u0027clock the next morning if he had any intention of saving himself from dismissal. When Charley arrived at his office, Mr. Corkscrew was still with the authorities, and Charley\u0027s turn was to come next. Charley was rather a favourite with Mr. Oldeschole, having been appointed by himself at the instance of Mr. Oldeschole\u0027s great friend, Sir Gilbert de Salop; and he was, moreover, the best-looking of the whole lot of navvies; but he was no favourite with Mr. Snape. \u0027Poor Screwy—it will be all up with him,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027He might just as well have gone on with his party and had his fun out.\u0027 \u0027It will, I imagine, be necessary to make more than one example, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said Mr. Snape, with a voice of utmost severity. \u0027A-a-a-men,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027If everything else fails, I think I\u0027ll go into the green line. You couldn\u0027t give me a helping hand, could you, Mr. Snape?\u0027 There was a rumour afloat in the office that Mr. Snape\u0027s wife held some little interest in a small greengrocer\u0027s establishment. \u0027Mr. Tudor to attend in the board-room, immediately,\u0027 said a fat messenger, who opened the door wide with a start, and then stood with it in his hand while he delivered the message. \u0027All right,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027I\u0027ll tumble up and be with them in ten seconds;\u0027 and then collecting together a large bundle of the arrears of the Kennett and Avon lock entries, being just as much as he could carry, he took the disordered papers and placed them on Mr. Snape\u0027s desk, exactly over the paper on which he was writing, and immediately under his nose. \u0027Mr. Tudor—Mr. Tudor!\u0027 said Snape. \u0027As I am to tear myself away from you, Mr. Snape, it is better that I should hand over these valuable documents to your safe keeping. There they are, Mr. Snape; pray see that you have got them all;\u0027 and so saying, he left the room to attend to the high behests of Mr. Oldeschole. As he went along the passages he met Verax Corkscrew returning from his interview. \u0027Well, Screwy,\u0027 said he, \u0027and how fares it with you? Pork chops are bad things in summer, ain\u0027t they?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all U-P,\u0027 said Corkscrew, almost crying. \u0027I\u0027m to go down to the bottom, and I\u0027m to stay at the office till seven o\u0027clock every day for a month; and old Foolscap says he\u0027ll ship me the next time I\u0027m absent half-an-hour without leave.\u0027 \u0027Oh! is that all?\u0027 said Charley. \u0027If that\u0027s all you get for pork chops and senna, I\u0027m all right. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if I did not get promoted;\u0027 and so he went in to his interview. What was the nature of the advice given him, what amount of caution he was called on to endure, need not here be exactly specified. We all know with how light a rod a father chastises the son he loves, let Solomon have given what counsel he may to the contrary. Charley, in spite of his manifold sins, was a favourite, and he came forth from the board-room an unscathed man. In fact, he had been promoted as he had surmised, seeing that Corkscrew who had been his senior was now his junior. He came forth unscathed, and walking with an easy air into his room, put his hat on his head and told his brother clerks that he should be there to-morrow morning at ten, or at any rate soon after. \u0027And where are you going now, Mr. Tudor?\u0027 said Snape. \u0027To meet my grandmother at Islington, if you please, sir,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027I have permission from Mr. Oldeschole to attend upon her for the rest of the day—perhaps you would like to ask him.\u0027 And so saying he went off to his appointment with Mr. M\u0027Ruen at the \u0027Banks of Jordan.\u0027 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748/75742.html","bookId":1354,"book":{"id":1354,"title":"The Three Clerks","description":"简介： There is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction, and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree in Kensington Gardens of a summer day...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
