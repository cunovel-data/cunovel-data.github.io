{"id":39348,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XX. — A DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES.—EVENING","content":"\u0027Excelsior!\u0027 said Charley to himself, as he walked on a few steps towards his lodgings, having left Norman at the door of his club. \u0027Remember it now—now, to-night.\u0027 Yes—now is the time to remember it, if it is ever to be remembered to any advantage. He went on with stoic resolution to the end of the street, determined to press home and put the last touch to \u0027Crinoline and Macassar;\u0027 but as he went he thought of his interview with Mr. M\u0027Ruen and of the five sovereigns still in his pocket, and altered his course. Charley had not been so resolute with the usurer, so determined to get ?5 from him on this special day, without a special object in view. His credit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner; he had about a week since borrowed money from the woman who kept the public-house in Norfolk Street, and having borrowed it for a week only, felt that this was a debt of honour which it was incumbent on him to pay. Therefore, when he had walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings, he retraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts. The house which he frequented was hardly more like a modern London gin-palace than was that other house in the city which Mr. M\u0027Ruen honoured with his custom. It was one of those small tranquil shrines of Bacchus in which the god is worshipped perhaps with as constant a devotion, though with less noisy demonstrations of zeal than in his larger and more public temples. None absolutely of the lower orders were encouraged to come thither for oblivion. It had about it nothing inviting to the general eye. No gas illuminations proclaimed its midnight grandeur. No huge folding doors, one set here and another there, gave ingress and egress to a wretched crowd of poverty-stricken midnight revellers. No reiterated assertions in gaudy letters, each a foot long, as to the peculiar merits of the old tom or Hodge\u0027s cream of the valley, seduced the thirsty traveller. The panelling over the window bore the simple announcement, in modest letters, of the name of the landlady, Mrs. Davis; and the same name appeared with equal modesty on the one gas lamp opposite the door. Mrs. Davis was a widow, and her customers were chiefly people who knew her and frequented her house regularly. Lawyers\u0027 clerks, who were either unmarried, or whose married homes were perhaps not so comfortable as the widow\u0027s front parlour; tradesmen, not of the best sort, glad to get away from the noise of their children; young men who had begun the cares of life in ambiguous positions, just on the confines of respectability, and who, finding themselves too weak in flesh to cling on to the round of the ladder above them, were sinking from year to year to lower steps, and depths even below the level of Mrs. Davis\u0027s public-house. To these might be added some few of a somewhat higher rank in life, though perhaps of a lower rank of respectability; young men who, like Charley Tudor and his comrades, liked their ease and self-indulgence, and were too indifferent as to the class of companions against whom they might rub their shoulders while seeking it. The \u0027Cat and Whistle,\u0027 for such was the name of Mrs. Davis\u0027s establishment, had been a house of call for the young men of the Internal Navigation long before Charley\u0027s time. What first gave rise to the connexion it is not now easy to say; but Charley had found it, and had fostered it into a close alliance, which greatly exceeded any amount of intimacy which existed previously to his day. It must not be presumed that he, in an ordinary way, took his place among the lawyers\u0027 clerks, and general run of customers in the front parlour; occasionally he condescended to preside there over the quiet revels, to sing a song for the guests, which was sure to be applauded to the echo, and to engage in a little skirmish of politics with a retired lamp-maker and a silversmith\u0027s foreman from the Strand, who always called him \u0027Sir,\u0027 and received what he said with the greatest respect; but, as a rule, he quaffed his Falernian in a little secluded parlour behind the bar, in which sat the widow Davis, auditing her accounts in the morning, and giving out orders in the evening to Norah Geraghty, her barmaid, and to an attendant sylph, who ministered to the front parlour, taking in goes of gin and screws of tobacco, and bringing out the price thereof with praiseworthy punctuality. Latterly, indeed, Charley had utterly deserted the front parlour; for there had come there a pestilent fellow, highly connected with the Press, as the lamp-maker declared, but employed as an assistant shorthand-writer somewhere about the Houses of Parliament, according to the silversmith, who greatly interfered with our navvy\u0027s authority. He would not at all allow that what Charley said was law, entertained fearfully democratic principles of his own, and was not at all the gentleman. So Charley drew himself up, declined to converse any further on politics with a man who seemed to know more about them than himself, and confined himself exclusively to the inner room. On arriving at this elysium, on the night in question, he found Mrs. Davis usefully engaged in darning a stocking, while Scatterall sat opposite with a cigar in his mouth, his hat over his nose, and a glass of gin and water before him. \u0027I began to think you weren\u0027t coming,\u0027 said Scatterall, \u0027and I was getting so deuced dull that I was positively thinking of going home.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s very civil of you, Mr. Scatterall,\u0027 said the widow. \u0027Well, you\u0027ve been sitting there for the last half-hour without saying a word to me; and it is dull. Looking at a woman mending stockings is dull, ain\u0027t it, Charley?\u0027 \u0027That depends,\u0027 said Charley, \u0027partly on whom the woman may be, and partly on whom the man may be. Where\u0027s Norah, Mrs. Davis?\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not very well to-night; she has got a headache; there ain\u0027t many of them here to-night, so she\u0027s lying down.\u0027 \u0027A little seedy, I suppose,\u0027 said Scatterall. Charley felt rather angry with his friend for applying such an epithet to his lady-love; however, he did not resent it, but sitting down, lighted his pipe and sipped his gin and water. And so they sat for the next quarter of an hour, saying very little to each other. What was the nature of the attraction which induced two such men as Charley Tudor and Dick Scatterall to give Mrs. Davis the benefit of their society, while she was mending her stockings, it might be difficult to explain. They could have smoked in their own rooms as well, and have drunk gin and water there, if they had any real predilection for that mixture. Mrs. Davis was neither young nor beautiful, nor more than ordinarily witty. Charley, it is true, had an allurement to entice him thither, but this could not be said of Scatterall, to whom the lovely Norah was never more than decently civil. Had they been desired, in their own paternal halls, to sit and see their mother\u0027s housekeeper darn the family stockings, they would, probably, both of them have rebelled, even though the supply of tobacco and gin and water should be gratuitous and unlimited. It must be presumed that the only charm of the pursuit was in its acknowledged impropriety. They both understood that there was something fast in frequenting Mrs. Davis\u0027s inner parlour, something slow in remaining at home; and so they both sat there, and Mrs. Davis went on with her darning-needle, nothing abashed. \u0027Well, I think I shall go,\u0027 said Scatterall, shaking off the last ash from the end of his third cigar. \u0027Do,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027you should be careful, you know; late hours will hurt your complexion.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s so deuced dull,\u0027 said Scatterall. \u0027Why don\u0027t you go into the parlour, and have a chat with the gentlemen?\u0027 suggested Mrs. Davis; \u0027there\u0027s Mr. Peppermint there now, lecturing about the war; upon my word he talks very well.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s so deuced low,\u0027 said Scatterall. \u0027He\u0027s a bumptious noisy blackguard too,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027he doesn\u0027t know how to speak to a gentleman, when he meets one.\u0027 Scatterall gave a great yawn. \u0027I suppose you\u0027re not going, Charley?\u0027 said he. \u0027Oh yes, I am,\u0027 said Charley, \u0027in about two hours.\u0027 \u0027Two hours! well, good night, old fellow, for I\u0027m off. Three cigars, Mrs. Davis, and two goes of gin and water, the last cold.\u0027 Then, having made this little commercial communication to the landlady, he gave another yawn, and took himself away. Mrs. Davis opened her little book, jotted down the items, and then, having folded up her stockings, and put them into a basket, prepared herself for conversation. But, though Mrs. Davis prepared herself for conversation, she did not immediately commence it. Having something special to say, she probably thought that she might improve her opportunity of saying it by allowing Charley to begin. She got up and pottered about the room, went to a cupboard, and wiped a couple of glasses, and then out into the bar and arranged the jugs and pots. This done, she returned to the little room, and again sat herself down in her chair. \u0027Here\u0027s your five pounds, Mrs. Davis,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027I wish you knew the trouble I have had to get it for you.\u0027 To give Mrs. Davis her due, this was not the subject on which she was anxious to speak. She would have been at present well inclined that Charley should remain her debtor. \u0027Indeed, Mr. Tudor, I am very sorry you should have taken any trouble on such a trifle. If you\u0027re short of money, it will do for me just as well in October.\u0027 Charley looked at the sovereigns, and bethought himself how very short of cash he was. Then he thought of the fight he had had to get them, in order that he might pay the money which he had felt so ashamed of having borrowed, and he determined to resist the temptation. \u0027Did you ever know me flush of cash? You had better take them while you can get them,\u0027 and as he pushed them across the table with his stick, he remembered that all he had left was ninepence. \u0027I don\u0027t want the money at present, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said the widow. \u0027We\u0027re such old friends that there ought not to be a word between us about such a trifle—now don\u0027t leave yourself bare; take what you want and settle with me at quarter-day.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027ll take a sovereign,\u0027 said he, \u0027for to tell you the truth, I have only the ghost of a shilling in my pocket.\u0027 And so it was settled; Mrs. Davis reluctantly pocketed four of Mr. M\u0027Ruen\u0027s sovereigns, and Charley kept in his own possession the fifth, as to which he had had so hard a combat in the lobby of the bank. He then sat silent for a while and smoked, and Mrs. Davis again waited for him to begin the subject on which she wished to speak. \u0027And what\u0027s the matter with Norah all this time?\u0027 he said at last. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with her?\u0027 repeated Mrs. Davis. \u0027Well, I think you might know what\u0027s the matter with her. You don\u0027t suppose she\u0027s made of stone, do you?\u0027 Charley saw that he was in for it. It was in vain that Norman\u0027s last word was still ringing in his ears. \u0027Excelsior!\u0027 What had he to do with \u0027Excelsior?\u0027 What miserable reptile on God\u0027s earth was more prone to crawl downwards than he had shown himself to be? And then again a vision floated across his mind\u0027s eye of a young sweet angel face with large bright eyes, with soft delicate skin, and all the exquisite charms of gentle birth and gentle nurture. A single soft touch seemed to press his arm, a touch that he had so often felt, and had never felt without acknowledging to himself that there was something in it almost divine. All this passed rapidly through his mind, as he was preparing to answer Mrs. Davis\u0027s question touching Norah Geraghty. \u0027You don\u0027t think she\u0027s made of stone, do you?\u0027 said the widow, repeating her words. \u0027Indeed I don\u0027t think she\u0027s made of anything but what\u0027s suitable to a very nice young woman,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027A nice young woman! Is that all you can say for her? I call her a very fine girl.\u0027 Miss Golightly\u0027s friends could not say anything more, even for that young lady. \u0027I don\u0027t know where you\u0027ll pick up a handsomer, or a better-conducted one either, for the matter of that.\u0027 \u0027Indeed she is,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Oh! for the matter of that, no one knows it better than yourself, Mr. Tudor; and she\u0027s as well able to keep a man\u0027s house over his head as some others that take a deal of pride in themselves.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m quite sure of it,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Well, the long and the short of it is this, Mr. Tudor.\u0027 And as she spoke the widow got a little red in the face: she had, as Charley thought, an unpleasant look of resolution about her—a roundness about her mouth, and a sort of fierceness in her eyes. \u0027The long and the short of it is this, Mr. Tudor, what do you mean to do about the girl?\u0027 \u0027Do about her?\u0027 said Charley, almost bewildered in his misery. \u0027Yes, do about her. Do you mean to make her your wife? That\u0027s plain English. Because I\u0027ll tell you what: I\u0027ll not see her put upon any longer. It must be one thing or the other; and that at once. And if you\u0027ve a grain of honour in you, Mr. Tudor—and I think you are honourable—you won\u0027t back from your word with the girl now.\u0027 \u0027Back from my word?\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Yes, back from your word,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis, the flood-gates of whose eloquence were now fairly opened. \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027re too much of the gentleman to deny your own words, and them repeated more than once in my presence—Cheroots—yes, are there none there, child?—Oh, they are in the cupboard.\u0027 These last words were not part of her address to Charley, but were given in reply to a requisition from the attendant nymph outside. \u0027You\u0027re too much of a gentleman to do that, I know. And so, as I\u0027m her natural friend—and indeed she\u0027s my cousin, not that far off—I think it\u0027s right that we should all understand one another.\u0027 \u0027Oh, quite right,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027You can\u0027t expect that she should go and sacrifice herself for you, you know,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis, who now that she had begun hardly knew how to stop herself. \u0027A girl\u0027s time is her money. She\u0027s at her best now, and a girl like her must make her hay while the sun shines. She can\u0027t go on fal-lalling with you, and then nothing to come of it. You mustn\u0027t suppose she\u0027s to lose her market that way.\u0027 \u0027God knows I should be sorry to injure her, Mrs. Davis.\u0027 \u0027I believe you would, because I take you for an honourable gentleman as will be as good as your word. Now, there\u0027s Peppermint there.\u0027 \u0027What! that fellow in the parlour?\u0027 \u0027And an honourable gentleman he is. Not that I mean to compare him to you, Mr. Tudor, nor yet doesn\u0027t Norah; not by no means. But there he is. Well, he comes with the most honourablest proposals, and will make her Mrs. Peppermint to-morrow, if so be that she\u0027ll have it.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t mean to say that there has been anything between them?\u0027 said Charley, who in spite of the intense desire which he had felt a few minutes since to get the lovely Norah altogether off his hands, now felt an acute pang of jealousy.\u0027 You don\u0027t mean to say that there has been anything between them?\u0027 \u0027Nothing as you have any right to object to, Mr. Tudor. You may be sure I wouldn\u0027t allow of that, nor yet wouldn\u0027t Norah demean herself to it.\u0027 \u0027Then how did she get talking to him?\u0027 \u0027She didn\u0027t get talking to him. But he has eyes in his head, and you don\u0027t suppose but what he can see with them. If a girl is in the public line, of course any man is free to speak to her. If you don\u0027t like it, it is for you to take her out of it. Not but what, for a girl that is in the public line, Norah Geraghty keeps herself to herself as much as any girl you ever set eyes on.\u0027 \u0027What the d—— has she to do with this fellow then?\u0027 \u0027Why, he\u0027s a widower, and has three young children; and he\u0027s looking out for a mother for them; and he thinks Norah will suit. There, now you have the truth, and the whole truth.\u0027 \u0027D—— his impudence!\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t see that there\u0027s any impudence. He has a house of his own and the means to keep it. Now I\u0027ll tell you what it is. Norah can\u0027t abide him—\u0027 Charley looked a little better satisfied when he heard this declaration. \u0027Norah can\u0027t abide the sight of him; nor won\u0027t of any man as long as you are hanging after her. She\u0027s as true as steel, and proud you ought to be of her.\u0027 Proud, thought Charley, as he again muttered to himself, \u0027Excelsior!\u0027—\u0027But, Mr. Tudor, I won\u0027t see her put upon; that\u0027s the long and the short of it. If you like to take her, there she is. I don\u0027t say she\u0027s just your equal as to breeding, though she\u0027s come of decent people too; but she\u0027s good as gold. She\u0027ll make a shilling go as far as any young woman I know; and if ?100 or ?150 are wanting for furniture or the like of that, why, I\u0027ve that regard for her, that that shan\u0027t stand in the way. Now, Mr. Tudor, I\u0027ve spoke honest; and if you\u0027re the gentleman as I takes you to be, you\u0027ll do the same.\u0027 To do Mrs. Davis justice, it must be acknowledged that in her way she had spoken honestly. Of course she knew that such a marriage would be a dreadful misalliance for young Tudor; of course she knew that all his friends would be heart-broken when they heard of it. But what had she to do with his friends? Her sympathies, her good wishes, were for her friend. Had Norah fallen a victim to Charley\u0027s admiration, and then been cast off to eat the bitterest bread to which any human being is ever doomed, what then would Charley\u0027s friends have cared for her? There was a fair fight between them. If Norah Geraghty, as a reward for her prudence, could get a husband in a rank of life above her, instead of falling into utter destruction as might so easily have been the case, who could do other than praise her—praise her and her clever friend who had so assisted her in her struggle? Dolus an virtus— Had Mrs. Davis ever studied the classics she would have thus expressed herself. Poor Charley was altogether thrown on his beam-ends. He had altogether played Mrs. Davis\u0027s game in evincing jealousy at Mr. Peppermint\u0027s attentions. He knew this, and yet for the life of him he could not help being jealous. He wanted to get rid of Miss Geraghty, and yet he could not endure that anyone else should lay claim to her favour. He was very weak. He knew how much depended on the way in which he might answer this woman at the present moment; he knew that he ought now to make it plain to her, that however foolish he might have been, however false he might have been, it was quite out of the question that he should marry her barmaid. But he did not do so. He was worse than weak. It was not only the disinclination to give pain, or even the dread of the storm that would ensue, which deterred him; but an absurd dislike to think that Mr. Peppermint should be graciously received there as the barmaid\u0027s acknowledged admirer. \u0027Is she really ill now?\u0027 said he. \u0027She\u0027s not so ill but what she shall make herself well enough to welcome you, if you\u0027ll say the word that you ought to say. The most that ails her is fretting at the long delay.—Bolt the door, child, and go to bed; there will be no one else here now. Go up, and tell Miss Geraghty to come down; she hasn\u0027t got her clothes off yet, I know.\u0027 Mrs. Davis was too good a general to press Charley for an absolute, immediate, fixed answer to her question. She knew that she had already gained much, by talking thus of the proposed marriage, by setting it thus plainly before Charley, without rebuke or denial from him. He had not objected to receiving a visit from Norah, on the implied understanding that she was to come down to him as his affianced bride. He had not agreed to this in words; but silence gives consent, and Mrs. Davis felt that should it ever hereafter become necessary to prove anything, what had passed would enable her to prove a good deal. Charley puffed at his cigar and sipped his gin and water. It was now twelve o\u0027clock, and he thoroughly wished himself at home and in bed. The longer he thought of it the more impossible it appeared that he should get out of the house without the scene which he dreaded. The girl had bolted the door, put away her cups and mugs, and her step upstairs had struck heavily on his ears. The house was not large or high, and he fancied that he heard mutterings on the landing-place. Indeed he did not doubt but that Miss Geraghty had listened to most of the conversation which had taken place. \u0027Excuse me a minute, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis, who was now smiling and civil enough; \u0027I will go upstairs myself; the silly girl is shamefaced, and does not like to come down\u0027; and up went Mrs. Davis to see that her barmaid\u0027s curls and dress were nice and jaunty. It would not do now, at this moment, for Norah to offend her lover by any untidiness. Charley for a moment thought of the front door. The enemy had allowed him an opportunity for retreating. He might slip out before either of the women came down, and then never more be heard of in Norfolk Street again. He had his hand in his waistcoat pocket, with the intent of leaving the sovereign on the table; but when the moment came he felt ashamed of the pusillanimity of such an escape, and therefore stood, or rather sat his ground, with a courage worthy of a better purpose. Down the two women came, and Charley felt his heart beating against his ribs. As the steps came nearer the door, he began to wish that Mr. Peppermint had been successful. The widow entered the room first, and at her heels the expectant beauty. We can hardly say that she was blushing; but she did look rather shamefaced, and hung back a little at the door, as though she still had half a mind to think better of it, and go off to her bed. \u0027Come in, you little fool,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis. \u0027You needn\u0027t be ashamed of coming down to see him; you have done that often enough before now.\u0027 Norah simpered and sidled. \u0027Well, I\u0027m sure now!\u0027 said she. \u0027Here\u0027s a start, Mr. Tudor; to be brought downstairs at this time of night; and I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s about\u0027; and then she shook her curls, and twitched her dress, and made as though she were going to pass through the room to her accustomed place at the bar. Norah Geraghty was a fine girl. Putting her in comparison with Miss Golightly, we are inclined to say that she was the finer girl of the two; and that, barring position, money, and fashion, she was qualified to make the better wife. In point of education, that is, the effects of education, there was not perhaps much to choose between them. Norah could make an excellent pudding, and was willing enough to exercise her industry and art in doing so; Miss Golightly could copy music, but she did not like the trouble; and could play a waltz badly. Neither of them had ever read anything beyond a few novels. In this respect, as to the amount of labour done, Miss Golightly had certainly far surpassed her rival competitor for Charley\u0027s affections. Charley got up and took her hand; and as he did so, he saw that her nails were dirty. He put his arms round her waist and kissed her; and as he caressed her, his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her hair was none of the best. He thought of those young lustrous eyes that would look up so wondrously into his face; he thought of the gentle touch, which would send a thrill through all his nerves; and then he felt very sick. \u0027Well, upon my word, Mr. Tudor,\u0027 said Miss Geraghty, \u0027you\u0027re making very free to-night.\u0027 She did not, however, refuse to sit down on his knee, though while sitting there she struggled and tossed herself, and shook her long ringlets in Charley\u0027s face, till he wished her—safe at home in Mr. Peppermint\u0027s nursery. \u0027And is that what you brought me down for, Mrs. Davis?\u0027 said Norah. \u0027Well, upon my word, I hope the door\u0027s locked; we shall have all the world in here else.\u0027 \u0027If you hadn\u0027t come down to him, he\u0027d have come up to you,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis. \u0027Would he though?\u0027 said Norah; \u0027I think he knows a trick worth two of that;\u0027 and she looked as though she knew well how to defend herself, if any over-zeal on the part of her lover should ever induce him to violate the sanctum of her feminine retirement. There was no over-zeal now about Charley. He ought to have been happy enough, for he had his charmer in his arms; but he showed very little of the ecstatic joy of a favoured lover. There he sat with Norah in his arms, and as we have said, Norah was a handsome girl; but he would much sooner have been copying the Kennett and Avon canal lock entries in Mr. Snape\u0027s room at the Internal Navigation. \u0027Lawks, Mr. Tudor, you needn\u0027t hold me so tight,\u0027 said Norah. \u0027He means to hold you tight enough now,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis. \u0027He\u0027s very angry because I mentioned another gentleman\u0027s name.\u0027 \u0027Well, now you didn\u0027t?\u0027 said Norah, pretending to look very angry. \u0027Well, I just did; and if you\u0027d only seen him! You must be very careful what you say to that gentleman, or there\u0027ll be a row in the house.\u0027 \u0027I!\u0027 said Norah. \u0027What I say to him! It\u0027s very little I have to say to the man. But I shall tell him this; he\u0027d better take himself somewhere else, if he\u0027s going to make himself troublesome.\u0027 All this time Charley had said nothing, but was sitting with his hat on his head, and his cigar in his mouth. The latter appendage he had laid down for a moment when he saluted Miss Geraghty; but he had resumed it, having at the moment no intention of repeating the compliment. \u0027And so you were jealous, were you?\u0027 said she, turning round and looking at him. \u0027Well now, some people might have more respect for other people than to mix up their names that way, with the names of any men that choose to put themselves forward. What would you say if I was to talk to you about Miss——\u0027 Charley stopped her mouth. It was not to be borne that she should be allowed to pronounce the name that was about to fall from her lips. \u0027So you were jealous, were you?\u0027 said she, when she was again able to speak. \u0027Well, my!\u0027 \u0027Mrs. Davis told me flatly that you were going to marry the man,\u0027 said Charley; \u0027so what was I to think?\u0027 \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what you think now,\u0027 said Mrs. Davis; \u0027for you must be off from this. Do you know what o\u0027clock it is? Do you want the house to get a bad name? Come, you two understand each other now, so you may as well give over billing and cooing for this time. It\u0027s all settled now, isn\u0027t it, Mr. Tudor?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes, I suppose so,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Well, and what do you say, Norah?\u0027 \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sure I\u0027m agreeable if he is. Ha! ha! ha! I only hope he won\u0027t think me too forward—he! he! he!\u0027 And then with another kiss, and very few more words of any sort, Charley took himself off. \u0027I\u0027ll have nothing more to do with him,\u0027 said Norah, bursting into tears, as soon as the door was well bolted after Charley\u0027s exit. \u0027I\u0027m only losing myself with him. He don\u0027t mean anything, and I said he didn\u0027t all along. He\u0027d have pitched me to Old Scratch, while I was sitting there on his knee, if he\u0027d have had his own way—so he would;\u0027 and poor Norah cried heartily, as she went to her work in her usual way among the bottles and taps. \u0027Why, you fool you, what do you expect? You don\u0027t think he\u0027s to jump down your throat, do you? You can but try it on; and then if it don\u0027t do, why there\u0027s the other one to fall back on; only, if I had the choice, I\u0027d rather have young Tudor, too.\u0027 \u0027So would I,\u0027 said Norah; \u0027I can\u0027t abide that other fellow.\u0027 \u0027Well, there, that\u0027s how it is, you know—beggars can\u0027t be choosers. But come, make us a drop of something hot; a little drop will do yourself good; but it\u0027s better not to take it before him, unless when he presses you.\u0027 So the two ladies sat down to console themselves, as best they might, for the reverses which trade and love so often bring with them. Charley walked off a miserable man. He was thoroughly ashamed of himself, thoroughly acknowledged his own weakness; and yet as he went out from the \u0027Cat and Whistle,\u0027 he felt sure that he should return there again to renew the degradation from which he had suffered this night. Indeed, what else could he do now? He had, as it were, solemnly plighted his troth to the girl before a third person who had brought them together, with the acknowledged purpose of witnessing that ceremony. He had, before Mrs. Davis, and before the girl herself, heard her spoken of as his wife, and had agreed to the understanding that such an arrangement was a settled thing. What else had he to do now but to return and complete his part of the bargain? What else but that, and be a wretched, miserable, degraded man for the rest of his days; lower, viler, more contemptible, infinitely lower, even than his brother clerics at the office, whom in his pride he had so much despised? He walked from Norfolk Street into the Strand, and there the world was still alive, though it was now nearly one o\u0027clock. The debauched misery, the wretched outdoor midnight revelry of the world was there, streaming in and out from gin-palaces, and bawling itself hoarse with horrid, discordant, screech-owl slang. But he went his way unheeding and uncontaminated. Now, now that it was useless, he was thinking of the better things of the world; nothing now seemed worth his grasp, nothing now seemed pleasurable, nothing capable of giving joy, but what was decent, good, reputable, cleanly, and polished. How he hated now that lower world with which he had for the last three years condescended to pass so much of his time! how he hated himself for his own vileness! He thought of what Alaric was, of what Norman was, of what he himself might have been—he that was praised by Mrs. Woodward for his talent, he that was encouraged to place himself among the authors of the day! He thought of all this, and then he thought of what he was—the affianced husband of Norah Geraghty! He went along the Strand, over the crossing under the statue of Charles on horseback, and up Pall Mall East till he came to the opening into the park under the Duke of York\u0027s column. The London night world was all alive as he made his way. From the Opera Colonnade shrill voices shrieked out at him as he passed, and drunken men coming down from the night supper-houses in the Haymarket saluted him with affectionate cordiality. The hoarse waterman from the cabstand, whose voice had perished in the night air, croaked out at him the offer of a vehicle; and one of the night beggar-women who cling like burrs to those who roam the street a these unhallowed hours still stuck to him, as she had done ever since he had entered the Strand. \u0027Get away with you,\u0027 said Charley, turning at the wretched creature in his fierce anger; \u0027get away, or I\u0027ll give you in charge.\u0027 \u0027That you may never know what it is to be in misery yourself!\u0027 said the miserable Irishwoman. \u0027If you follow me a step farther I\u0027ll have you locked up,\u0027 said Charley. \u0027Oh, then, it\u0027s you that have the hard heart,\u0027 said she; \u0027and it\u0027s you that will suffer yet.\u0027 Charley looked round, threw her the odd halfpence which he had in his pocket, and then turned down towards the column. The woman picked up her prize, and, with a speedy blessing, took herself off in search of other prey. His way home would have taken him up Waterloo Place, but the space round the column was now deserted and quiet, and sauntering there, without thinking of what he did, he paced up and down between the Clubs and the steps leading into the park. There, walking to and fro slowly, he thought of his past career, of all the circumstances of his life since his life had been left to his own control, and of the absence of all hope for the future. What was he to do? He was deeply, inextricably in debt. That wretch, M\u0027Ruen, had his name on bills which it was impossible that he should ever pay. Tradesmen held other bills of his which were either now over-due, or would very shortly become so. He was threatened with numerous writs, any one of which would suffice to put him into gaol. From his poor father, burdened as he was with other children, he knew that he had no right to expect further assistance. He was in debt to Norman, his best, he would have said his only friend, had it not been that in all his misery he could not help still thinking of Mrs. Woodward as his friend. And yet how could his venture to think longer of her, contaminated as he now was with the horrid degradation of his acknowledged love at the \u0027Cat and Whistle!\u0027 No; he must think no more of the Woodwards; he must dream no more of those angel eyes which in his waking moments had so often peered at him out of heaven, teaching him to think of higher things, giving him higher hopes than those which had come to him from the working of his own unaided spirit. Ah! lessons taught in vain! vain hopes! lessons that had come all too late! hopes that had been cherished only to be deceived! It was all over now! He had made his bed, and he must lie on it; he had sown his seed, and he must reap his produce; there was now no \u0027Excelsior\u0027 left for him within the bounds of human probability. He had promised to go to Hampton with Harry Norman on Saturday, and he would go there for the last time. He would go there and tell Mrs. Woodward so much of the truth as he could bring himself to utter; he would say farewell to that blest abode; he would take Linda\u0027s soft hand in his for the last time; for the last time he would hear the young, silver-ringing, happy voice of his darling Katie; for the last time look into her bright face; for the last time play with her as with a child of heaven—and then he would return to the \u0027Cat and Whistle.\u0027 And having made this resolve he went home to his lodgings. It was singular that in all his misery the idea hardly once occurred to him of setting himself right in the world by accepting his cousin\u0027s offer of Miss Golightly\u0027s hand and fortune.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748/75744.html","bookId":1354,"book":{"id":1354,"title":"The Three Clerks","description":"简介： There is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as well as for the writing of works of fiction, and there can be no better place for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree in Kensington Gardens of a summer day...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2748","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
