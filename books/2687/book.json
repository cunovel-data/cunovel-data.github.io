His deputy sheriff job, plus battle injuries that ended his military career, keep him right where he wants to be: Off the ranch and away from his family\u0027s pity. His darkest war memories are on lockdown, leaving him skeptical he\u0027ll ever find a woman who wants a man who\u0027s less than whole. \\n Domini Katzinski has had to control every aspect of her life since age eleven, when she was orphaned in the Ukraine. Watching others\u0027 relationships crumble has convinced her to focus on the short-term and find a take-charge man to whom she can relinquish total sexual control.

Plus, he has his own handcuffs. \\n Once Cam gets over his surprise that sweet, shy Domini wants to be dominated, he is back to issuing orders. Their passion is as hot as a rocket-propelled grenade--and if Domini has her way, it\u0027s a one-shot deal. Cam wants more, and launches a full-out sensual assault...until tragedy strikes, forcing him to change tactics as he tries to keep past demons from blowing their future together all to hell...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shoulda-been-a-cowboy-rough-riders-7.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":8,"name":"Western","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
