{"id":70174,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"“You hands are on me, not him.” Cam circled her wrists and placed her hands behind her; one on Cam’s right thigh, one high on the left. “I’ll touch you while you’re sucking him.” The position would’ve been awkward if not for the arch in her spine which caused her nipples to brush the bristly hair on Brock’s legs and tingle deliciously in response. She smiled. Cam knew how much she loved nipple play. Even now he was seeing to her sexual needs. “Open,” Brock directed. She closed her eyes, dropped her jaw in anticipation of all that smooth, hot, hard flesh pushing past her lips and teeth, over her tongue until it filled her mouth completely. Brock swirled the cockhead over her lips and plunged in to the root. Domini started to gag. Cam’s voice drifted to her. “Relax. Breathe.” Brock wasn’t expecting a slow tease. He pumped in and out in a smooth rhythm that Domini knew would get him off quickly. Cam twined his hands in her hair, holding it out of her face. “You have no idea how fucking hot it is to see his dick in your mouth.” A slight hum from her had Brock groaning, “Jesus. Do that again.” She did. Domini looked up at Brock. A little thrill shot through her, seeing him lost in pleasure. She understood Cam was giving this intimate moment to Brock as much as she was. Was it easier for Cam to show his gratitude for his friendship when he was proving to Brock that Cam McKay was still one hundred percent dominant male? “More, come on, take it all,” Brock urged, forcing her to refocus. As she created tight suction on every withdrawal, she slackened her throat muscles when Brock plunged back in to the root. His hardness filled her mouth over and over, sending her into hazy subspace where she existed on a whole different plane. “You’re beautiful,” Cam whispered. “So damn beautiful I can’t think for wanting you. Two men so fucking hot for you that we’re both gonna fuck you at once. Me in that tight pussy. Brock in your tight ass. You’re getting wet thinking about it, aren’t you?” She moaned. The sensations were devastating. The constant wet suction of Brock’s slippery cock fucking her mouth. The rasp of her nipples against Brock’s legs. Cam’s hand fisted in her hair. The ache in her arms. The feel of Cam’s rough skin as she dug her nails into his upper thighs. Three distinctively different breathing patterns distorted the air. Three different scents filled her lungs. But it was the simple eroticism of Cam’s words and his fingertips dancing up and down her arms that made her hot. She saw Brock’s hand reach between his legs and adjust his balls. “I need it faster.” Brock picked up the pace, and his fingers curled around her neck, his thumbs pressed on the spot her jawbone hinged, keeping her jaw open. “I’m so close…” “Come on her chest.” Brock groaned and eased out of Domini’s mouth. His left hand wrapped around his cock and he jacked off in short, fast strokes. The sound of his flesh slapping and his grunt of completion gave way to spurts of warm come landing on her chest as Brock watched through hooded eyes. His hand slowed, but didn’t stop, as if he didn’t want the moment to end. “Damn, woman. You’re something.” Cam rubbed the quivering muscles in her arms. “Stand up.” Brock snagged the towel, intending to wipe his come from Domini’s chest, but Cam snatched it. “Let me.” After he’d wiped her down, those intense blue eyes locked on hers. “You ready?” Her body trembled. Could she do this? She looked at Cam. Fire danced in his eyes. He wanted this. She nodded. “Get rid of your pants.” Domini shimmied them off. Cam hooked a finger under the elastic band of her panties and tugged her closer. “You’re wet.” He pressed his mouth to the section of skin below her belly button and sucked hard, holding her lower back so she couldn’t squirm away. Not that Domini tried to escape any time he put his hands or mouth on her. He’d sucked hard enough to leave a reddish-purple love bruise behind. “My mark looks pretty on your creamy skin. I’d like to leave love bites all over you.” “I wouldn’t stop you,” Domini said, reaching out to caress the side of his face. “I know.” He kissed her belly one last time. “Climb up on my lap.” Cam widened his legs to fit outside of the chair legs. He brought her high up on his thighs; his erection nestled into the crack of her butt. Domini tried desperately not to put weight on Cam’s left side. She gasped when Cam hooked her legs over the arms of the chair, baring her most intimate parts completely. “Look at that.” Brock stood a few feet away, hot eyes drawn to and devouring her sex. “Pretty pink isn’t it? Soft. Wet. Sweet.” “You offering me a taste?” Again, Cam answered for her. “Yep.” “Hot damn.” Brock dropped to his knees. She couldn’t seem to find her voice through the staccato beats of her heart. Cam’s large, work-roughed hands followed the curve of her legs from her ankles up to the crease of her thighs. He traced one finger up her slit and gently separated her pussy lips, exposing her clit. Oh no. Surely they didn’t plan on…double-teaming her. Brock bent his head and lapped at the moisture pouring from the mouth of her sex, curling his long, pink tongue inside. Not only did Brock expertly use his tongue, the contrast of his dark face and light-colored mouth, centered between her milky white thighs, was an undeniably hot image. Domini moaned when Brock wiggled his tongue inside her. Then Brock licked the folds surrounding her core, suckling her pussy lips, stopping below the swollen nub throbbing for attention. “How close are you to coming?” Cam murmured in her ear. “A hair trigger away,” she admitted. A look passed between Cam and Brock, but Brock didn’t look at her. He fastened his mouth to her clit. No tongue swirling teases. No drawn out licks. Brock just kept sucking on that pearl until the orgasm steamrolled over her. Domini gasped through each strong pulse, listening to the sexy timbre of Cam’s voice in her ear, which only heightened the heat in her groin. By the time the final throb ended, her body trembled. She wanted to crawl into Cam’s big bed and sleep. Naturally Cam and Brock had other plans. Brock said, “Up you go,” and lifted her off the chair and to her feet. After that orgasm she didn’t have enough breath in her lungs to protest and hardly the wherewithal to even stand. “We’re both gonna fuck you now.” The fog cleared from her head at that command. “Here? But…” Why not in his bed? “This is more stable for my leg.” “Oh.” But she knew there was more to his reasoning. He whispered fiercely, “My bed is our space, Domini. I won’t share you in it. Ever. Not even for an hour.” He used his teeth on her earlobe. “I’m pushing you to the edge you wanted. To the place where your body knows what it wants even if you’re unsure.” Cam drew his finger from her chin down to her belly button. “Trust me.” “I do.” As soon as Cam lay back on the sofa, she crawled up and managed to situate her legs on either side of his hips. “You’ll have to lean against me completely and angle your ass so Brock can reach you.” To please herself and to quell her nerves, she rubbed her breasts over his chest, loving his quick intake of breath when her nipples brushed his. “I like being pressed against you like this,” she whispered. “Face to face.” “Me too, princess.” Cam’s lips drifted across hers in an almost kiss. “Ready?” A tiny wave of apprehension flowed through her but she nodded. “Brock? You suited up?” “Yep. Suited up, slicked up and ready to go.” Cam sifted his fingers through her hair. “You’re gonna have to do most the work since I’m flat on my back.” “Being naked with you is hardly work.” “God, woman, sometimes you undo me,” he rasped. Such raw emotion in his eyes. “Cam.” “I know. Let’s do this. Lower onto me.” His cock filled her and she closed her eyes with a sigh. This was familiar. Cam tapped her chin with his finger. “Eyes on me. Always on me.” His avid mouth controlled hers and coupled with his greedy hands roaming over her bare body, Domini almost didn’t notice a slippery finger circling her anus until it wiggled inside. Her gasp was lost in Cam’s mouth when a second finger joined the first. Stretching her. Fucking her steadily. Brock didn’t say a word as he prepared her. It was surreal, feeling him so intimately, but not seeing him. Both fingers disappeared. She stiffened. “Gotta relax,” Cam murmured against her mouth. When Cam threaded his hands though her hair, kissing her like she was the center of his universe, she forgot how big the head of Brock’s penis was until it pressed past the ring of muscle. Burning pain followed. Domini fought the urge to break free from Cam and buck Brock off. Cam sensed her panic. “You can take him. Just like you took me.” He nuzzled her neck. Her temple. Her ear. “Loosen up, let go, let us make you feel good. Let me give you something you’ve never had.” He licked and teased the pulse point at the base of her throat. “I love how you taste here.” “How do I taste?” “Like fire. Like ice. Like mine.” Their gazes collided. When Cam’s tongue swept into her mouth, she fell headfirst into his powerful kiss. Somewhere in the back of Domini’s mind she realized Brock had been very quiet. Too quiet. Cam kept a haze of passion floating between them she could almost touch. Then Brock snapped his hips and drove into her ass completely.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shoulda-been-a-cowboy-rough-riders-7/page-28.html","bookId":2687,"book":{"id":2687,"title":"Shoulda Been a Cowboy (Rough Riders #7)","description":"Storyline: Shoulda Been a Cowboy (Rough Riders #7) The bigger they are, the harder they fall--in love.
