{"id":40750,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"The ugly six-story building at the corner of the Kochstrasse and the Wilhelmstrasse was the only one standing in a waste of empty bombed space. Bond paid off his taxi and got a brief impression of the neighborhood-waist-high weeds and half-tidied rubble walls stretching away to a big deserted crossroads lit by a central cluster of yellowish arc lamps-before he pushed the bell for the fourth floor and at once heard the click of the door opener. The door closed itself behind him, and he walked over the uncarpeted cement floor to the old-fashioned lift. The smell of cabbage, cheap cigar smoke, and stale sweat reminded him of other apartment houses in Germany and Central Europe. Even the sigh and faint squeal of the slow lift were part of a hundred assignments when he had been fired off by M., like a projectile, at some distant target where a problem waited for his coming, waited to be solved by him. At least this time the reception committee was on his side. This time there was nothing to fear at the top of the stairs. \n Number Two of Secret Service Station WB was a lean, tense man in his early forties. He wore the uniform of his profession-well-cut, well-used, lightweight tweeds in a dark green herringbone, a soft white silk shirt, and an old school tie (in his case Wykehamist). At the sight of the tie, and while they exchanged conventional greetings in the small musty lobby of the apartment, Bond\u0027s spirits, already low, sank another degree. He knew the type-backbone of the civil service... overcrammed and underloved at Winchester... a good second in P.P.E. at Oxford... the war, staff jobs he would have done meticulously-perhaps an O.B.E.... Allied Control Commission in Germany where he had been recruited into the I Branch.... And thence-because he was the ideal staff man and A-one with Security, and because he thought he would find life, drama, romance-the things he had never had-into the Secret Service. A sober, careful man had been needed to chaperone Bond on this ugly business. Captain Paul Sender, late of the Welsh Guards, had been the obvious choice. He had bought it. Now, like a good Wykehamist, he concealed his distaste for the job beneath careful, trite conversation as he showed Bond the layout of the apartment and the arrangements that had been made for the executioner\u0027s preparedness and, to a modest extent, his comfort. \n The flat consisted of a large double bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen containing tinned food, milk, butter, eggs, bread, and one bottle of Dimple Haig. The only odd feature in the bedroom was that one of the double beds was angled up against the curtains covering the single broad window and was piled high with three mattresses below the bedclothes. \n Captain Sender said, \"Care to have a look at the field of fire? Then I can explain what the other side has in mind.\" \n Bond was tired. He didn\u0027t particularly want to go to sleep with the picture of the battlefield on his mind. But he said, \"That\u0027d be fine.\" \n Captain Sender switched off the lights. Chinks from the streetlight at the intersection showed round the curtains. \"Don\u0027t want to draw the curtains,\" said Captain Sender. \"Unlikely, but they may be on the lookout for a covering party for 272. If you\u0027d just lie on the bed and get your head under the curtains, I\u0027ll brief you about what you\u0027ll be looking at. Look to the left.\" \n It was a sash window, and the bottom half was open. The mattresses, by design, gave only a little, and James Bond found himself more or less in the firing position he had been in on the Century Range. But now he was staring across broken, thickly weeded bombed ground toward the bright river of the Zirnmerstrasse-the border with East Berlin. It looked about a hundred and fifty yards away. Captain Sender\u0027s voice from above him and behind the curtain began reciting. It reminded Bond of a spiritualist sйance. \n \"That\u0027s bombed ground in front of you. Plenty of cover. A hundred and thirty yards of it up to the frontier. Then the frontier-the street-and then a big stretch of more bombed ground on the enemy side. That\u0027s why 272 chose this route. It\u0027s one of the few places in the town which is broken land-thick weeds, ruined walls, cellars-on both sides of the frontier.... 272 will sneak through that mess on the other side, and make a dash across the Zirnmerstrasse for the mess on our side. Trouble is, he\u0027ll have thirty yards of brightly lit frontier to sprint across. That\u0027ll be the killing ground. Right?\" \n Bond said, \"Yes.\" He said it softly. The scent of the enemy, the need to take care, already had him by the nerves. \n \"To your left, that big new ten-story block is the Haus der Ministerien, the chief brain center of East Berlin. You can see the lights are still on in most of the windows. Most of those will stay on all night. These chaps work hard-shifts all round the clock. You probably won\u0027t need to worry about the lighted ones. This Trigger chap will almost certainly fire from one of the dark windows. You\u0027ll see there\u0027s a block of four together on the corner above the intersection. They\u0027ve stayed dark last night and tonight. They\u0027ve got the best field of fire. From here, their range varies from three hundred to three hundred and ten yards. I\u0027ve got all the figures and so on when you want them. You needn\u0027t worry about much else. That street stays empty during the night-only the motorized patrols about every half an hour. Light armored car with a couple of motorcycles as escort. Last night, which I suppose is typical, between six and seven when this thing\u0027s going to be done, there were a few people that came and went out of that side door. Civil-servant types. Before that nothing out of the ordinary-usual flow of people in and out of a busy government building, except, of all things, a whole damned woman\u0027s orchestra. Made a hell of a racket in some concert hall they\u0027ve got in there. Part of the block is the Ministry of Culture. Otherwise nothing-certainly none of the KGB people we know, or any signs of preparation for a job like this. But there wouldn\u0027t be. They\u0027re careful chaps, the opposition. Anyway, have a good look. Don\u0027t forget it\u0027s darker than it will be tomorrow around six. But you can get the general picture.\" \n Bond got the general picture, and it stayed with him long after the other man was asleep and snoring softly with a gentle regular clicking sound. A Wykehamist snore, Bond reflected irritably. \n Yes, he had got the picture. The picture of a flicker of movement among the shadowy ruins on the other side of the gleaming river of light, a pause, the wild zigzagging sprint of a man in the full glare of the arcs, the crash of gunfire-and then either a crumpled, sprawling heap in the middle of the wide street or the noise of his onward dash through the weeds and rubble of the Western Sector. Sudden death or a home run. The true gauntlet! How much time would Bond have to spot the Russian sniper in one of those dark windows? And kill him? Five seconds? Ten? When dawn edged the curtains with gun metal, Bond capitulated to his fretting mind. It had won. He went softly into the bathroom and surveyed the ranks of medicine bottles that a thoughtful Secret Service had provided to keep its executioner in good shape. He selected the Tuinal, chased down two of the ruby and blue depth-charges with a glass of water, and went back to bed. Then, poleaxed, he slept. \n He awoke at midday. The flat was empty. Bond drew the curtains to let in the gray Prussian day, and, standing well back from the window, gazed out at the drabness of Berlin, and listened to the tram noises and to the distant screeching of the U-Bahn as it took the big curve into the Zoo Station. He gave a quick, reluctant glance at what he had examined the night before, noted that the weeds among the bomb rubble were much the same as the London ones-campion, dock, and bracken-and then went into the kitchen. \n There was a note propped against a loaf of bread: \"My friend [a Secret Service euphemism that in this context meant Sender\u0027s chief] says it\u0027s all right for you to go out. But to be back by 1700 hours. Your gear [doubletalk for Bond\u0027s rifle] has arrived and the batman will lay it out this P.M. P. Sender.\" \n Bond lit the gas cooker, and with a sneer at his profession, burned the message. Then he brewed himself a vast dish of scrambled eggs and bacon, which he heaped on buttered toast and washed down with black coffee into which he had poured a liberal tot of whiskey. Then he bathed and shaved, dressed in the drab, anonymous, middle-European clothes he had brought over for the purpose, looked at his disordered bed, decided to hell with it, and went down in the lift and out of the building. \n James Bond had always found Berlin a glum, inimical city, varnished on the Western side with a brittle veneer of gimcrack polish rather like the chromium trim on American motorcars. He walked to the Kurfьrstendamm and sat in the Cafй Marquardt and drank an espresso and moodily watched the obedient queues of pedestrians waiting for the Go sign on the traffic lights while the shiny stream of cars went through their dangerous quadrille at the busy intersection. It was cold outside and the sharp wind from the Russian steppes whipped at the girls\u0027 skirts and at the waterproofs of the impatient hurrying men, each with the inevitable briefcase tucked under his arm. The infrared wall heaters in the cafe glared redly down and gave a spurious glow to the faces of the cafe squatters, consuming their traditional \"one cup of coffee and ten glasses of water,\" reading the free newspapers and periodicals in their wooden racks, earnestly bending over business documents. Bond, closing his mind to the evening, debated with himself about ways to spend the afternoon. It finally came down to a choice between a visit to that respectable-looking brownstone house in the Clausewitzstrasse known to all concierges and taxi drivers and a trip to the Wannsee and a strenuous walk in the Grunewald. Virtue triumphed. Bond paid for his coffee and went out into the cold and took a taxi to the Zoo Station. \n The pretty young trees round the long lake had already been touched by the breath of autumn, and there was occasional gold amongst the green. Bond walked hard for two hours along the leafy paths, then chose a restaurant with a glassed-in veranda above the lake and greatly enjoyed a high tea consisting of a double portion of Matjeshering, smothered in cream and onion rings, and two Molle mit Korn. (This Berlin equivalent of a boilermaker and his assistant was a schnapps, double, washed down with draught Lцwenbrдu.) Then, feeling more encouraged, he took the S-Bahn back into the city. \n Outside the apartment house, a nondescript young man was tinkering with the engine of a black Opel Kapitan. He didn\u0027t take his head out from under the bonnet when Bond passed close by him and went up to the door and pressed the bell. \n Captain Sender was reassuring. It was a \"friend\"-a corporal from the transport section of Station WB. He had fixed up some bad engine trouble on the Opel. Each night, from six to seven, he would be ready to produce a series of multiple backfires when a signal on a walkie-talkie operated by Sender told him to do so. This would give some kind of cover for the noise of Bond\u0027s shooting. Otherwise, the neighborhood might alert the police and there would be a lot of untidy explaining to be done. Their hideout was in the American Sector, and while their American \"friends\" had given Station WB clearance for this operation, the \"friends\" were naturally anxious that it should be a clean job and without repercussions. \n Bond was suitably impressed by the car gimmick, as he was by the very workmanlike preparations that had been made for him in the living room. Here, behind the head of his high bed, giving a perfect firing position, a wood and metal stand had been erected against the broad windowsill, and along it lay the Winchester, the tip of its barrel just denting the curtains. The wood and all the metal parts of the rifle and sniperscope had been painted a dull black, and, laid out on the bed like sinister evening clothes, was a black velvet hood stitched to a waist-length shirt of the same material. The hood had wide slits for the eyes and mouth. It reminded Bond of old prints of the Spanish Inquisition or of the anonymous operators on the guillotine platform during the French Revolution. There was a similar hood on Captain Sender\u0027s bed, and on his section of the windowsill there lay a pair of nightglasses and the microphone for the walkie-talkie. \n Captain Sender, his face worried and tense with nerves, said there was no news at the Station, no change in the situation as they knew it. Did Bond want anything to eat? Or a cup of tea? Perhaps a tranquilizer-there were several kinds in the bathroom? \n Bond stitched a cheerful, relaxed expression on his face and said no thanks, and gave a lighthearted account of his day while an artery near his solar plexus began thumping gently as tension built up inside him like a watchspring tightening. Finally his small talk petered out and he lay down on his bed with a German thriller he had bought on his wanderings, while Captain Sender moved fretfully about the flat, looking too often at his watch and chainsmoking Kent filter-tips through (he was a careful man) a Dunhill filtered cigarette holder. \n James Bond\u0027s choice of reading matter, prompted by a spectacular jacket of a half-naked girl strapped to a bed, turned out to have been a happy one for the occasion. It was called Verderbt, Verdammt, Verraten. The prefix ver signified that the girl had not only been ruined, damned, and betrayed, but that she had suffered these misfortunes most thoroughly. James Bond temporarily lost himself in the tribulations of the heroine, Grдfin Liselotte Mutzenbacher, and it was with irritation that he heard Captain Sender say that it was five-thirty and time to take up their positions. \n Bond took off his coat and tie, put two sticks of chewing gum in his mouth, and donned the hood. The lights were switched off by Captain Sender, and Bond lay along the bed, got his eye to the eyepiece of the sniperscope, and gently lifted the bottom edge of the curtain back and over his shoulders. \n Now dusk was approaching, but otherwise the scene (a year later to become famous as Checkpoint Charlie) was like a well-remembered photograph-the wasteland in front of him, the bright river of the frontier road, the further wasteland, and, on the left, the ugly square block of the Haus der Ministerien with its lit and dark windows. Bond scanned it all slowly, moving the sniperscope, with the rifle, by means of the precision screws on the wooden base. It was all the same except that now there was a trickle of personnel leaving and entering the Haus der Ministerien through the door onto the Wilhelmstrasse. Bond looked long at the four dark windows-dark again tonight-that he agreed with Sender were the enemy\u0027s firing points. The curtains were drawn back, and the sash windows were wide open at the bottom. Bond\u0027s scope could not penetrate into the rooms, but there was no sign of movement within the four oblong black gaping mouths. \n Now there was extra traffic in the street below the windows. The woman\u0027s orchestra came trooping down the pavement toward the entrance. Twenty laughing, talking girls carrying their instruments-violin and wind instrument cases, satchels with their scores-and four of them with the drums. A gay, happy little crocodile. Bond was reflecting that some people still seemed to find life fun in the Soviet Sector, when his glasses picked out and stayed on the girl carrying the cello. Bond\u0027s masticating jaws stopped still, and then reflectively went on with their chewing as he twisted the screw to depress the sniperscope and keep her in its center. \n The girl was taller than the others, and her long, straight, fair hair, falling to her shoulders, shone like molten gold under the arcs at the intersection. She was hurrying along in a charming, excited way, carrying the cello case as if it were no heavier than a violin. Everything was flying-the skirt of her coat, her feet, her hair. She was vivid with movement and life and, it seemed, with gaiety and happiness as she chattered to the two girls who flanked her and laughed back at what she was saying. As she turned in at the entrance amidst her troupe, the arcs momentarily caught a beautiful, pale profile. And then she was gone, and, it seemed to Bond, that with her disappearance, a stab of grief lanced into his heart. How odd! How very odd! This had not happened to him since he was young. And now this single girl, seen only indistinctly and far away, had caused him to suffer this sharp pang of longing, this thrill of animal magnetism! Morosely, Bond glanced down at the luminous dial of his watch. Five-fifty. Only ten minutes to go. No transport arriving at the entrance. None of those anonymous black Zik saloons he had half-expected. He closed as much of his mind as he could to the girl and sharpened his wits. Get on, damn you! Get back to your job! \n From somewhere inside the Haus der Ministerien there came the familiar sounds of an orchestra tuning up-the strings tuning their instruments to single notes on the piano, the sharp blare of individual woodwinds-then a pause, and then the collective crash of melody as the whole orchestra threw itself competently, so far as Bond could judge, into the opening bars of what even to James Bond was vaguely familiar. \n \"Moussorgsky\u0027s Overture to Boris Godunov,\" said Captain Sender succinctly. \"Anyway, six o\u0027clock coming up.\" And then, urgently, \"Hey! Right-hand bottom of the four windows! Watch out!\" \n Bond depressed the sniperscope. Yes, there was movement inside the black cave. Now, from the interior, a thick black object, a weapon, had slid out. It moved firmly, minutely, swiveling down and sideways so as to cover the stretch of the Zimmerstrasse between the two wastelands of rubble. Then the unseen operator in the room behind seemed satisfied, and the weapon remained still, fixed obviously to such a stand as Bond had beneath his rifle. \n \"What is it? What sort of gun?\" Captain Sender\u0027s voice was more breathless than it should have been. \n Take it easy, dammit! thought Bond. It\u0027s me who\u0027s supposed to have the nerves. \n He strained his eyes, taking in the squat flash eliminator at the muzzle, the telescopic sight, and the thick downward chunk of magazine. Yes, that would be it! Absolutely for sure-and the best they had! \n \"Kalashnikov,\" he said curtly. \"Submachinegun. Gas-operated. Thirty rounds in seven sixty-two millimeter. Favorite with the KGB. They\u0027re going to do a saturation job after all. Perfect for range. We\u0027ll have to get him pretty quick, or 272 will end up not just dead but strawberry jam. You keep an eye out for any movement over there in the rubble. I\u0027ll have to stay married to that window and the gun. He\u0027ll have to show himself to fire. Other chaps are probably spotting behind him-perhaps from all four windows. Much the sort of setup we expected, but I didn\u0027t think they\u0027d use a weapon that\u0027s going to make all the racket this one will. Should have known they would. A running man will be hard to get in this light with a single-shot job.\" \n Bond fiddled minutely with the traversing and elevating screws at his fingertips and got the fine lines of the scope exactly intersected, just behind where the butt of the enemy gun merged into the blackness behind. Get the chest-don\u0027t bother about the head! \n Inside the hood, Bond\u0027s face began to sweat and his eye socket was slippery against the rubber of the eyepiece. That didn\u0027t matter. It was only his hands, his trigger finger, that must stay bone dry. As the minutes ticked by, he frequently blinked his eyes to rest them, shifted his limbs to keep them supple, listened to the music to relax his mind. \n The minutes slouched on leaden feet. How old would she be? Early twenties? Say twenty-three? With that poise and insouciance, the hint of authority in her long easy stride, she would come of good racy stock-one of the old Prussian families probably or from similar remnants in Poland or even Russia. Why in hell did she have to choose the cello? There was something almost indecent in the idea of this bulbous, ungainly instrument between her splayed thighs. Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, and so did that girl Amaryllis somebody. But they should invent a way for women to play the damned thing sidesaddle. \n From his side Captain Sender said, \"Seven o\u0027clock. Nothing\u0027s stirred on the other side. Bit of movement on our side, near a cellar close to the frontier. That\u0027ll be our reception committee-two good men from the Station. Better stay with it until they close down. Let me know when they take that gun in.\" - \"All right.\" \n It was seven-thirty when the KGB submachinegun was gently drawn back into the black interior. One by one the bottom sashes of the four windows were closed. The coldhearted game was over for the night. 272 was still holed up. Two more nights to go! - Bond softly drew the curtain over his shoulders and across the muzzle of the Winchester. He got up, pulled off his cowl, and went into the bathroom, where he stripped and had a shower. Then he had two large whiskeys-on-the-rocks in quick succession, while he waited, his ears pricked, for the now muffled sound of the orchestra to stop. At eight o\u0027clock it did, with the expert comment from Sender-\"Borodin\u0027s Prince Igor, Choral Dance Number 17, I think.\"-who had been getting off his report in garbled language to the Head of Station. \n \"Just going to have another look. I\u0027ve rather taken to that tall blonde with the cello,\" Bond said to Sender. \"Didn\u0027t notice her,\" said Sender, uninterested. He went into the kitchen. Tea, guessed Bond. Or perhaps Horlick\u0027s. Bond donned his cowl, went back to his firing position, and depressed the sniperscope to the doorway of the Haus der Ministerien. Yes, there they went, not so gay and laughing now. Tired perhaps. And now here she came, less lively, but still with that beautiful careless stride. Bond watched the blown golden hair and the fawn raincoat until it had vanished into the indigo dusk up the Wilhelmstrasse. Where did she live? In some miserable flaked room in the suburbs? Or in one of the privileged apartments in the hideous lavatory-tiled Stalinallee? \n Bond drew himself back. Somewhere, within easy reach, that girl lived. Was she married? Did she have a lover? Anyway, to hell with it! She was not for him. \n \n * * * \n \n The next day, and the next night watch, were duplicates, with small variations, of the first. James Bond had his two more brief rendezvous, by sniperscope, with the girl, and the rest was a killing of time and a tightening of the tension that, by the time the third and final day came, was like a fog in the small room. \n James Bond crammed the third day with an almost lunatic program of museums, art galleries, the zoo, and a film, hardly perceiving anything he looked at, his mind\u0027s eye divided between the girl and those four black squares and the black tube and the unknown man behind it-the man he was now certainly going to kill tonight. \n Back punctually at five in the apartment, Bond narrowly averted a row with Captain Sender because, that evening, Bond took a stiff drink of the whiskey before he donned the hideous cowl that now stank of his sweat. Captain Sender had tried to prevent him, and when he failed, had threatened to call up Head of Station and report Bond for breaking training. \n \"Look, my friend,\" said Bond wearily, \"I\u0027ve got to commit a murder tonight. Not you. Me. So be a good chap and stuff it, would you? You can tell Tanqueray anything you like when it\u0027s over. Think I like this job? Having a Double-O number and so on? I\u0027d be quite happy for you to get me sacked from the Double-O Section. Then I could settle down and make a snug nest of papers as an ordinary staffer. Right?\" Bond drank down his whiskey, reached for his thriller-now arriving at an appalling climax-and threw himself on the bed. \n Captain Sender, icily silent, went off into the kitchen to brew, from the sounds, his inevitable cuppa. \n Bond felt the whiskey beginning to melt the coiled nerves in his stomach. Now then, Liselotte, how in hell are you going to get out of this fix? \n It was exactly six-five when Sender, at his post, began talking excitedly. \"Bond, there\u0027s something moving way back over there. Now he\u0027s stopped-wait, no, he\u0027s on the move again, keeping low. There\u0027s a bit of broken wall there. He\u0027ll be out of sight of the opposition. But thick weeds, yards of them, ahead of him. Christ! He\u0027s coming through the weeds. And they\u0027re moving. Hope to God they think it\u0027s only the wind. Now he\u0027s through and gone to ground. Any reaction?\" \n \"No,\" said Bond tensely. \"Keep on telling me. How far to the frontier?\" \n \"He\u0027s only got about fifty yards to go,\" Captain Sender\u0027s voice was harsh with excitement. \"Broken stuff, but some of it\u0027s open. Then a solid chunk of wall right up against the pavement. He\u0027ll have to get over it. They can\u0027t fail to spot him then. Now! Now he\u0027s made ten yards, and another ten. Got him clearly then. Blackened his face and hands. Get ready! Any moment now he\u0027ll make the last sprint.\" \n James Bond felt the sweat pouring down his face and neck. He took a chance and quickly wiped his hands down his sides and then got them back to the rifle, his finger inside the guard, just lying along the curved trigger. \"There\u0027s something moving in the room behind the gun. They must have spotted him. Get that Opel working.\" \n Bond heard the code word go into the microphone, heard the Opel in the street below start up, felt his pulse quicken as the engine leaped into life and a series of ear-splitting cracks came from the exhaust. \n The movement in the black cave was now definite. A black arm with a black glove had reached out and under the stock. \n \"Now!\" called out Captain Sender. \"Now! He\u0027s run for the wall! He\u0027s up it! Just going to jump!\" \n And then, in the sniperscope, Bond saw the head of Trigger-the purity of the profile, the golden bell of hair-all laid out along the stock of the Kalashnikov! She was dead, a sitting duck! Bond\u0027s fingers flashed down to the screws, inched them round, and as yellow flame fluttered at the snout of the submachinegun, squeezed the trigger. \n The bullet, dead-on at three hundred and ten yards, must have hit where the stock ended up the barrel, might have got her in the left hand-but the effect was to tear the gun off its mountings, smash it against the side of the window frame, and then hurl it out of the window. It turned several times on its way down and crashed into the middle of the street. \n \"He\u0027s over!\" shouted Captain Sender. \"He\u0027s over! He\u0027s done it! My God, he\u0027s done it!\" \n \"Get down!\" said Bond sharply, and threw himself sideways off the bed as the big eye of a searchlight in one of the black windows blazed on, swerving up the street toward their block and their room. Then gunfire crashed, and the bullets howled into their window, ripping the curtains, smashing the woodwork, thudding into the walls. \n Behind the roar and zing of the bullets, Bond heard the Opel race off down the street, and, behind that again, the fragmentary whisper of the orchestra. The combination of the two background noises clicked. Of course! The orchestra, that must have raised an infernal din throughout the offices and corridors of the Haus der Ministerien, was, as on their side the backfiring Opel, designed to provide some cover for the sharp burst of fire from Trigger. Had she carried her weapon to and fro every day in that cello case? Was the whole orchestra composed of KGB women? Had the other instrument cases contained only equipment-the big drum perhaps the searchlight-while the real instruments were available in the concert hall? Too elaborate? Too fantastic? Probably. \n But there had been no doubt about the girl. In the sniperscope, Bond had even been able to see one wide, heavily lashed, aiming eye. Had he hurt her? Almost certainly her left arm. There would be no chance of seeing her, seeing how she was, if she left with the orchestra. Now he would never see her again. Bond\u0027s window would be a death trap. To underline the fact, a stray bullet smashed into the mechanism of the Winchester, already overturned and damaged, and hot lead splashed down on Bond\u0027s hand, burning the skin. On Bond\u0027s emphatic oath, the firing stopped abruptly and silence sang in the room. \n Captain Sender emerged from beside his bed, brushing glass out of his hair. Bond and Sender crunched across the floor and through the splintered door into the kitchen. Here, because the room faced away from the street, it was safe to switch on the light. \n \"Any damage?\" asked Bond. \n \"No. You all right?\" Captain Sender\u0027s pale eyes were bright with the fever that comes in battle. They also, Bond noticed, held a sharp glint of accusation. \n \"Yes. Just get an Elastoplast for my hand. Caught a splash from one of the bullets.\" Bond went into the bathroom. When he came out, Captain Sender was sitting by the walkie-talkie he had fetched from the sitting room. He was speaking into it. Now he said into the microphone, \"That\u0027s all for now. Fine about 272. Hurry the armored car, if you would. Be glad to get out of here, and 007 will need to write his version of what happened. Okay? Then over and out.\" \n Captain Sender turned to Bond. Half accusing, half embarrassed he said, \"Afraid Head of Station needs your reasons in writing for not getting that chap. I had to tell him I\u0027d seen you alter your aim at the last second. Gave Trigger time to get off a burst. Damned lucky for 272 he\u0027d just begun his sprint. Blew chunks off the wall behind him. What was it all about?\" \n James Bond knew he could lie, knew he could fake a dozen reasons why. Instead he took a deep pull at the strong whiskey he had poured for himself, put the glass down, and looked Captain Sender straight in the eye. \n \"Trigger was a woman.\" \n \"So what? KGB has got plenty of women agents-and women gunners. I\u0027m not in the least surprised. The Russian woman\u0027s team always does well in the World Championships. Last meeting, in Moscow, they came first, second, and third against seventeen countries. I can even remember two of their names-Donskaya and Lomova. Terrific shots. She may even have been one of them. What did she look like? Records\u0027ll probably be able to turn her up.\" \n \"She was a blonde. She was the girl who carried the cello in that orchestra. Probably had her gun in the cello case. The orchestra was to cover up the shooting.\" \n \"Oh!\" said Captain Sender slowly. \"I see. The girl you were keen on?\" \n \"That\u0027s right.\" \n \"Well, I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ll have to put that in my report too. You had clear orders to exterminate Trigger.\" \n There came the sound of a car approaching. It pulled up somewhere below. The bell rang twice. Sender said, \"Well, let\u0027s get going. They\u0027ve sent an armored car to get us out of here.\" He paused. His eyes flicked over Bond\u0027s shoulder, avoiding Bond\u0027s eyes. \"Sorry about the report. Got to do my duty, y\u0027know. You should have killed that sniper whoever it was.\" \n Bond got up. He suddenly didn\u0027t want to leave the stinking little smashed-up flat, leave the place from which, for three days, he had had this long-range, onesided romance with an unknown girl-an unknown enemy agent with much the same job in her outfit as he had in his.

At least they\u0027d stop short of killing her-as he himself had done. \n James Bond said wearily, \"Okay. With any luck it\u0027ll cost me my Double-O number. But tell Head of Station not to worry. That girl won\u0027t do any more sniping. Probably lost her left hand. Certainly broke her nerve for that kind of work. Scared the living daylights out of her. In my book, that was enough.
