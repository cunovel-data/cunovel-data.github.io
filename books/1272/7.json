{"id":40752,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Through the next day, Bond\u0027s excitement mounted. He found an excuse to go into the Communications Section and wander into the little room where Miss Maria Freudenstein and two assistants were working the cipher machines that handled the Purple Cipher dispatches. He picked up the en clair file-he had freedom of access to most material at headquarters-and ran his eye down the carefully edited paragraphs that, in half an hour to so, would be spiked, unread, by some junior C.I.A. clerk in Washington and, in Moscow, be handed, with reverence, to a top-ranking officer of the KGB. He joked with the two junior girls, but Maria Freudenstein only looked up from her machine to give him a polite smile and Bond\u0027s skin crawled minutely at this proximity to treachery and at the black and deadly secret locked up beneath the frilly white blouse. She was an unattractive girl with a pale, rather pimply skin, black hair and a vaguely unwashed appearance. Such a girl would be unloved, make few friends, have chips on her shoulder-more particularly in view of her illegitimacy-and a grouse against society. Perhaps her only pleasure in life was the triumphant secret she harbored La that flattish bosom-the knowledge that she was cleverer than all those around her, that she was, every day, hitting back against the world-the world that despised, or just ignored her, because of her plainness-with all her might. One day they\u0027d be sorry! It was a common neurotic pattern-the revenge of the ugly duckling on society. \n Bond wandered off down the corridor to his own office. By tonight that girl would have made a fortune, been paid her thirty pieces of silver a thousandfold. Perhaps the money would change her character, bring her happiness. She would be able to afford the best beauty specialists, the best clothes, a pretty flat. But M. had said he was now going to hot up the Purple Cipher Operation, try a more dangerous level of deception. This would be dicey work. One false step, one incautious lie, an ascertainable falsehood in a message, and the KGB would smell a rat. Once more, and they would know they were being hoaxed and probably had been ignominiously hoaxed for three years. Such a shameful revelation would bring quick revenge. It would be assumed that Maria Freudenstein had been acting as a double agent, working for the British as well as the Russians. She would inevitably and quickly be liquidated-perhaps with the cyanide pistol Bond had been reading about only the day before. \n James Bond, looking out of the window across the trees in Regent\u0027s Park, shrugged. Thank God it was none of his business. The girl\u0027s fate wasn\u0027t in his hands. She was caught in the grimy machine of espionage and she would be lucky if she lived to spend a tenth of the fortune she was going to gain in a few hours in the auction rooms. \n \n * * * \n \n There was a line of cars and taxis blocking George Street behind Sotheby\u0027s. Bond paid off his taxi and joined the crowd filtering under the awning and up the steps. He was handed a catalog by the uniformed Commissionaire who inspected his ticket, and went up the broad stairs with the fashionable, excited crowd and along a gallery and into the main auction room that was already thronged. He found his seat next to Mr. Snowman, who was writing figures on a pad on his knee, and looked round him. \n The lofty room was perhaps as large as a tennis court. It had the took and the smell of age and the two large chandeliers, to fit in with the period, blazed warmly in contrast to the strip lighting along the vaulted ceiling whose glass roof was partly obscured by a blind, still half-drawn against the sun that would have been blazing down on the afternoon\u0027s sale. Miscellaneous pictures and tapestries hung on the olive-green walls and batteries of television and other cameras (amongst them the M.I.5 cameraman with a press pass from The Sunday Times) were clustered with their handlers on a platform built out from the middle of a giant tapestried hunting scene. There were perhaps a hundred dealers and spectators sitting attentively on small gilt chairs. All eyes were focused on the slim, good-looking auctioneer talking quietly from the raised wooden pulpit. He was dressed in an immaculate dinner jacket with a red carnation in the buttonhole. He spoke unemphatically and without gestures. \n \"Fifteen thousand pounds. And sixteen,\" a pause. A glance at someone in the front row. \"Against you, sir.\" The flick of a catalog being raised. \"Seventeen thousand pounds I am bid. Eighteen. Nineteen. I am bid twenty thousand pounds.\" And so the quiet voice went, calmly, unhurriedly on while down among the audience the equally impassive bidders signaled their responses to the litany. \n \"What is he selling?\" asked Bond opening his catalog. \n \"Lot 40,\" said Mr. Snowman. \"That diamond riviиre the porter\u0027s holding on the black velvet tray. It\u0027ll probably go for about twenty-five. An Italian is bidding against a couple of Frenchmen. Otherwise they\u0027d have got it for twenty. I only went to fifteen. Liked to have got it. Wonderful stones. But there it is.\" \n Sure enough, the price stuck at twenty-five thousand and the hammer, held by its head and not by its handle, came down with soft authority. \"Yours, sir,\" said Mr. Peter Wilson and a sales clerk hurried down the aisle to confirm the identity of the bidder. \n \"I\u0027m disappointed,\" said Bond. \n Mr. Snowman looked up from his catalog. \"Why is that?\" \n \"I\u0027ve never been to an auction before and I always thought the auctioneer banged his gavel three times and said going, going, gone, so as to give the bidders a last chance.\" \n Mr. Snowman laughed. \"You might still find that operating in the Shires or in Ireland, but it hasn\u0027t been the fashion at London sale rooms since I\u0027ve been attending them.\" \n \"Pity. It adds to the drama.\" \n \"You\u0027ll get plenty of that in a minute. This is the last lot before the curtain goes up.\" \n One of the porters had reverently uncoiled a glittering mass of rubies and diamonds on his black velvet tray. Bond looked at the catalog. It said \"Lot 41\" which the luscious prose described as: \n A PAIR OF FINE AND IMPORTANT RUBY AND DIAMOND BRACELETS, the front of each in the form of an elliptical cluster composed of one larger and two smaller rubies within a border of cushioned-shaped diamonds, the sides and back formed of simpler clusters alternating with diamond openwork scroll motifs springing from single-stone ruby centers millegriffe-set in gold, running between chains of rubies and diamonds linked alternately, the clasp also in the form of an elliptical cluster. \n * According to family tradition, this lot was formerly the property of Mrs. Fitzherbert (1756-1837) whose marriage to The Prince of Wales afterwards Geo. IV was definitely established when in 1905 a sealed packet deposited at Coutts Bank in 1833 and opened by Royal permission disclosed the marriage certificate and other conclusive proofs. \n These bracelets were probably given by Mrs. Fitzherbert to her niece, who was described by the Duke of Orleans as \"the prettiest girl in England.\" \n While the bidding progressed, Bond slipped out of his seat and went down the aisle to the back of the room where the overflow audience spread out into the New Gallery and the Entrance Hall to watch the sale on closed-circuit television. He casually inspected the crowd, seeking any face he could recognize from the 200 members of the Soviet embassy staff whose photographs, clandestinely obtained, he had been studying during the past days. But amidst an audience that defied classification-a mixture of dealers, amateur collectors and what could be broadly classified as rich pleasure-seekers-was not a feature, let alone a face, that he could recognize except from the gossip columns. One or two sallow faces might have been Russian, but equally they might have belonged to half a dozen European races. There was a scattering of dark glasses, but dark glasses are no longer a disguise. Bond went back to his seat. Presumably the man would have to divulge himself when the bidding began. \n \"Fourteen thousand I am bid. And fifteen. Fifteen thousand.\" The hammer came down. \"Yours, sir.\" \n There was a hum of excitement and a fluttering of catalogs. Mr. Snowman wiped his forehead with a white silk handkerchief. He turned to Bond. \"Now I\u0027m afraid you are more or less on your own. I\u0027ve got to pay attention to the bidding and anyway for some unknown reason it\u0027s considered bad form to look over one\u0027s shoulder to see who\u0027s bidding against you-if you\u0027re in the trade that\u0027s to say-so I\u0027ll only be able to spot him if he\u0027s somewhere up front here, and I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s unlikely. Pretty well all dealers, but you can stare around as much as you like. What you\u0027ve got to do is to watch Peter Wilson\u0027s eyes and then try and see who he\u0027s looking at, or who\u0027s looking at him. If you can spot the man, which may be quite difficult, note any movement he makes, even the very smallest. Whatever the man does-scratching his head, pulling at the lobe of his ear or whatever, will be a code he\u0027s arranged with Peter Wilson. I\u0027m afraid he won\u0027t do anything obvious like raising his catalog. Do you get me? And don\u0027t forget that he may make absolutely no movement at all until right at the end when he\u0027s pushed me as far as he thinks I\u0027ll go, then he\u0027ll want to sign off. Mark you,\" Mr. Snowman smiled, \"when we get to the last lap I\u0027ll put plenty of heat on him and try and make him show his hand. That\u0027s assuming of course that we are the only two bidders left in.\" He looked enigmatic. \"And I think you can take it that we shall be.\" \n From the man\u0027s certainty, James Bond felt pretty sure that Mr. Snowman had been given instructions to get the Emerald Sphere at any cost. \n A sudden hush fell as a tall pedestal draped in black velvet was brought in with ceremony and positioned in front of the auctioneer\u0027s rostrum. Then a handsome oval case of what looked like white velvet was placed on top of the pedestal and, with reverence, an elderly porter in gray uniform with wine-red sleeves, collar and back belt, unlocked it and lifted out Lot 42, placed it on the black velvet and removed the case. The cricket ball of polished emerald on its exquisite base glowed with a supernatural green fire and the jewels on its surface and on the opalescent meridian winked their various colors. There was a gasp of admiration from the audience and even the clerks and experts behind the rostrum and sitting at the tall counting-house desk beside the auctioneer, accustomed to the Crown jewels of Europe parading before their eyes, leaned forward to get a better look. \n James Bond turned to his catalog. There it was, in heavy type and in prose as stickily luscious as a butterscotch sundae: \n THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE \n DESIGNED IN 1917 BY CARL FABERGЙ FOR A RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN AND NOW THE PROPERTY OF HIS GRANDDAUGHTER \n 42 A VERY IMPORTANT FABERGЙ TERRESTRIAL GLOBE. A sphere carved from an extraordinarily large piece of Siberian emerald matrix weighing approximately one thousand three hundred carats and of a superb color and vivid translucence, represents a terrestrial globe supported upon an elaborate rocaille scroll mount finely chased in quatre-couleur gold and set with a profusion of rose-diamonds and small emeralds of intense color, to form a table-clock. \n Around this mount six gold putti disport themselves among cloud-forms which are naturalistically rendered in carved rock-crystal finished matt and veined with fine lines of tiny rose-diamonds. The globe itself, the surface of which is meticulously engraved with a map of the world with the principal cities indicated by brilliant diamonds embedded within gold collets, rotates mechanically on an axis controlled by a small clock-movement, by G. Moser, signed, which is concealed in the base, and is girdled by a fixed gold belt enameled opalescent oyster along a reserved path in champlevй technique over a moirй guillochage with painted Roman numerals in pale sepia enamel serving as the dial of the clock, and a single triangular pigeon-blood Burma ruby of about five carats set into the surface of the orb, pointing the hour. Height: 7? in. Workmaster, Henrik Wigstrцm. In the original double-opening white velvet, satin-lined, oviform case with the gold key fitted in the base. \n * The theme of this magnificent sphere is one that had inspired Fabergй some fifteen years earlier, as evidenced in the miniature terrestrial globe which forms part of the Royal Collection at Sandringham. (See plate 280 in The Art of Carl Fabergй, by A. Kenneth Snowman.) \n After a brief and searching glance round the room, Mr. Wilson banged his hammer softly. \"Lot 42-an object of vertu by Carl Fabergй.\" A pause. \"Twenty thousand pounds I am bid.\" \n Mr. Snowman whispered to Bond, \"That means he\u0027s probably got a bid of at least fifty. This is simply to get things moving.\" \n Catalogs fluttered. \"And thirty, forty, fifty thousand pounds I am bid. And sixty, seventy, and eighty thousand pounds. And ninety.\" A pause and then: \"One hundred thousand pounds I am bid.\" \n There was a rattle of applause round the room. The cameras had swiveled to a youngish man, one of three on a raised platform to the left of the auctioneer who were speaking softly into telephones. Mr. Snowman commented, \"That\u0027s one of Sotheby\u0027s young men. He\u0027ll be on an open line to America. I should think that\u0027s the Metropolitan bidding, but it might be anybody. Now it\u0027s time for me to get to work.\" Mr. Snowman flicked up his rolled catalog. \n \"And ten,\" said the auctioneer. The man spoke into his telephone and nodded. \"And twenty.\" \n Again a flick from Mr. Snowman. \n \"And thirty.\" \n The man on the telephone seemed to be speaking rather more words than before into his mouthpiece-perhaps giving his estimate of how much further the price was likely to go. He gave a slight shake of his head in the direction of the auctioneer and Peter Wilson looked away from him and round the room. \n \"One hundred and thirty thousand pounds I am bid,\" he repeated quietly. \n Mr. Snowman said, softly, to Bond, \"Now you\u0027d better watch out. America seems to have signed off. It\u0027s time for your man to start pushing me.\" \n James Bond slid out of his place and went and stood amongst a group of reporters in a corner to the left of the rostrum. Peter Wilson\u0027s eyes were directed towards the far right-hand corner of the room. Bond could detect no movement, but the auctioneer announced \"And forty thousand pounds.\" He looked down at Mr. Snowman. After a long pause Mr. Snowman raised five fingers. Bond guessed that this was part of his process of putting the heat on. He was showing reluctance, hinting that he was near the end of his tether. \n \"One hundred and forty-five thousand.\" Again the piercing glance towards the back of the room. Again no movement. But again some signal had been exchanged. \"One hundred and fifty thousand pounds.\" \n There was a buzz of comment and some desultory clapping. This time Mr. Snowman\u0027s reaction was even slower and the auctioneer twice repeated the last bid. Finally he looked directly at Mr. Snowman. \"Against you, sir.\" At last Mr. Snowman raised five fingers. \n \"One hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds.\" \n James Bond was beginning to sweat. He had got absolutely nowhere and the bidding must surely be coming to an end. The auctioneer repeated the bid. \n And now there was the tiniest movement. At the back of the room, a chunky-looking man in a dark suit reached up and unobtrusively took off his dark glasses. It was a smooth, nondescript face-the sort of face that might belong to a bank manager, a member of Lloyd\u0027s, or a doctor. This must have been the prearranged code with the auctioneer. So long as the man wore his dark glasses he would raise in tens of thousands. When he took them off, he had quit. \n Bond shot a quick glance towards the bank of cameramen. Yes, the M.I.5 photographer was on his toes. He had also seen the movement. He lifted his camera deliberately and there was the quick glare of a flash. Bond got back to his seat and whispered to Snowman, \"Got him. Be in touch with you tomorrow. Thanks a lot.\" Mr. Snowman only nodded. His eyes remained glued on the auctioneer. \n Bond slipped out of his place and walked swiftly down the aisle as the auctioneer said for the third time, \"One hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds I am bid,\" and then softly brought down his hammer. \"Yours, sir.\" \n Bond got to the back of the room before the audience had risen, applauding, to its feet. His quarry was hemmed in amongst the gilt chairs. He had now put on his dark glasses again and Bond put on a pair of his own. He contrived to slip into the crowd and get behind the man as the chattering crowd streamed down the stairs. The hair grew low down on the back of the man\u0027s rather squat neck and the lobes of his ears were pinched in close to his head. He had a slight hump, perhaps only a bone deformation, high up on his back. Bond suddenly remembered. This was Piotr Malinowski, with the official title on the Embassy staff of \"Agricultural Attachй.\" So! \n Outside, the man began walking swiftly towards Conduit Street. James Bond got unhurriedly into a taxi with its engine running and its flag down. He said to the driver, \"That\u0027s him. Take it easy.\" \n \"Yes, sir,\" said the M.I.5 driver, pulling away from the curb. \n The man picked up a taxi in Bond Street. The tail in the mixed evening traffic was easy. Bond\u0027s satisfaction mounted as the Russian\u0027s taxi turned up north of the Park and along Bayswater. It was just a question whether he would turn down the private entrance into Kensington Palace Gardens, where the first mansion on the left is the massive building of the Soviet Embassy. If he did, that would clinch matters. The two patrolling policemen, the usual Embassy guards, had been specially picked that night. It was their job just to confirm that the occupant of the leading taxi actually entered the Soviet Embassy. \n Then, with the Secret Service evidence and the evidence of Bond and of the M.I.5 cameraman, there would be enough for the Foreign Office to declare Comrade Piotr Malinowski persona non grata on the grounds of espionage activity and send him packing. In the grim chess game that is secret service work, the Russians would have lost a queen. It would have been a very satisfactory visit to the auction rooms. \n The leading taxi did turn in through the big iron gates. \n Bond smiled with grim satisfaction. He leaned forward. \"Thanks, driver. Headquarters please.\" \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1576/46782.html","bookId":1272,"book":{"id":1272,"title":"007之八爪女 Octopussy","description":"简介： 苏联利用八爪女的马戏团在美国某空军基地演出的机会，与八爪女名义上是合作走私珠宝，实际上是使用核弹炸毁美国空军基地，以便挑起战争。007从一颗法布尔金蛋追踪到核弹，历尽艰险终于在最后一秒拆下核弹。为了解救八爪女，007又舍身爬上了起飞的飞机...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/08/10-11-38-84-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1576","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
