Speed is of the essence.\"\n Irina Spasky folded her clue, stuck in it her purse, and walked out the door.\n Alistair Oh frowned. \"It seems Cousin Irina has an idea.\"\n The Starling triplets put their heads together. Then, as if they\u0027d gotten a collective brain flash, they stood up so fast they knocked over their chairs and ran outside.\n Jonah Wizard\u0027s dad pulled him into the corner. They had a heated discussion and his dad typed some stuff into his BlackBerry.\n \"Gotta jet,\" Jonah said. \"Later, losers.\" And off they went.\n That made three teams already out the door, and Dan still had no idea what the clue meant.\n \"Well.\" Ian Kabra stretched lazily, like he had all the time in the world. \"Are you ready, dear sister?\"\n \"To make fools of our American cousins?\" Natalie smiled. \"Anytime.\"\n Dan tried to trip them as they walked past, but they nimbly stepped over his leg and kept going.\n \"All right!\" Mr. Holt announced. \"Team, form up!\"\n The Holt clan shot to their feet. Their buff little pit bull, Arnold, barked and leaped around them like he was trying to bite their noses.\n \"Where we going, Dad?\" Hamilton asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know. But everybody else is leaving! Follow them!\"\n They marched double-time out of the Great Hall, which left only Amy, Dan, Alistair Oh, and William McIntyre.\n \"Dear me,\" Alistair sighed. With his black suit and silk cravat, he reminded Dan of a butler. A butler with a secret. His eyes seemed to be smiling, even when he wasn\u0027t. \"I think I\u0027ll have a stroll around the grounds and think about this.\"\n Dan was thankful to see him leave. Alistair seemed like the nicest of their competition, but he was still competition.\n Dan stared at the clue again, more frustrated than ever. \"Resolution. Fine print.\n Richard S -- . I don\u0027t get it.\"\n \"I can offer you no help with the clue.\" Mr. McIntyre managed a faint smile. \"But your grandmother would be pleased you accepted the challenge.\"\n Amy shook her head. \"We don\u0027t stand a chance, do we? The Kabras and the Starlings are rich. Jonah Wizard\u0027s famous. The Holts are like steroid monsters. Alistair and Irina seem so -- I don\u0027t know -- worldly.\n And Dan and I -- \"\n \"Have other talents,\" Mr. McIntyre finished. \"As I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find out.\"\n Dan reread the clue. He thought about baseball cards, and letters, and autographs.\n \"We\u0027re supposed to find this guy Richard,\" he decided. \"But why is his last name just S___?\"\n Amy\u0027s eyes widened. \"Wait a minute. I remember reading that back in the 1700s, people used to do that. They would use only one letter if they wanted to disguise their names.\"\n \"Huh,\" Dan said. \"So, like, I could say A -- has a face like a baboon butt, and you wouldn\u0027t know who I\u0027m talking about?\"\n Amy boxed him on the ear.\n \"Ow!\"\n \"Children,\" Mr. McIntyre interrupted. \"You will have enough enemies without fighting each other. Besides\" -- he checked his gold pocket watch -- \"we don\u0027t have much time, and there is something I must tell you, something your grandmother wanted you to know.\"\n \"An inside tip?\" Dan asked hopefully.\n \"A warning, young master Dan. You see, all Cahills -- if they know themselves to be Cahills -- belong to one of four major branches.\"\n Amy stood up straight. \"I remember this! Grace told me once.\"\n Dan frowned. \"When did she tell you that?\"\n \"In the library one afternoon. We were talking.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t tell me!\"\n \"Maybe you weren\u0027t listening! There are four branches. The Ekaterina, the Janus, the ... uh, Tomas, and the Lucian.\"\n \"Which are we?\" Dan asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Amy looked at Mr. McIntyre for help. \"She just mentioned the names. She wouldn\u0027t tell me what we are.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you there,\" Mr. McIntyre said, but Dan could tell from his tone that he was keeping something back. \"However, children, there is another ... ah, interested party you should know about. Not one of the four Cahill branches, but a group that may make your quest more difficult.\"\n \"Ninjas?\" Dan asked excitedly.\n \"Nothing quite that safe,\" Mr. McIntyre said. \"I can tell you very little about them. I confess I know only the name and a few unsettling stories. But you must beware of them. This was your grandmother\u0027s last warning, which she made me promise to tell you if you accepted the challenge:\n Beware the Madrigals.\"\n A chill went down Dan\u0027s back. He wasn\u0027t sure why. The name Madrigals just sounded evil. \"But, Mr. McIntyre, who -- \"\n \"My boy,\" the old man said, \"I can tell you no more. I\u0027ve stretched the rules of the competition saying as much as I have. Just promise me you will trust no one. Please. For your own safety.\"\n \"But we don\u0027t even know where to start!\" Amy protested. \"Everyone else just rushed off like they knew what to do. We need answers!\"\n Mr. McIntyre stood. He closed his leather folder. \"I must get back to my office. But, my dear, perhaps your way of finding out is not the same as the other teams\u0027. What do you normally do when you need answers?\"\n \"I read a book.\" Amy gasped. \"The library! Grace\u0027s library!\"\n She raced out of the Great Hall. Usually, Dan did not run with excitement when his sister suggested visiting a library. This time, he did.\n The library was next to Grace\u0027s bedroom -- a big sunken parlor lined with bookshelves.\n Dan thought it was creepy being back here with just Amy, especially since Grace had died next door in her big four-poster bed. He expected the rooms to be all draped in black, with sheets over the furniture like you saw in movies, but the library was bright and airy and cheerful, just like it had always been.\n That didn\u0027t seem right to Dan. With Grace gone, the mansion should be dark and dreary -- kind of the way he felt. He stared at the leather chair by the window and remembered one time he\u0027d been sitting there, playing with a cool stone dagger he\u0027d busted out of a locked display case. Grace had come up so quietly he didn\u0027t notice her until she was standing right over him. Instead of getting mad, she\u0027d knelt next to him.\n That dagger is from Tenochtitl√°n, she\u0027d said.\n Aztec warriors used to carry these for ritual sacrifice. They would cut off the parts of their enemies that they believed held their fighting spirit.\n She\u0027d showed him how sharp the blade was, and then she left him alone. She hadn\u0027t told him to be careful. She hadn\u0027t gotten angry because he\u0027d busted into her cabinet.\n She\u0027d acted like his curiosity was totally normal -- even admirable.\n No adult had ever understood Dan that well. Thinking about it now, Dan felt like somebody had cut away part of his spirit.\n Amy started searching the library books. Dan tried to help, but he had no idea what he was looking for and quickly became bored. He spun the old globe with brown seas and weird-colored continents, wondering if it would make a good bowling ball. Then he noticed something he\u0027d never seen before under the Pacific Ocean -- a signature.\n Grace Cahill, 1964.\n \"Why did Grace autograph the world?\" he asked. Amy glanced over. \"She was a cartographer. A map-maker and an explorer. She made that globe herself.\"\n \"How did you know that?\"\n Amy rolled her eyes. \"Because I listened to her stories.\"\n \"Huh.\" That idea had never occurred to Dan. \"So where\u0027d she explore?\"\n A man\u0027s voice said, \"Everywhere.\"\n Alistair Oh was leaning on his cane in the doorway, smiling at them. \"Your grandmother explored every continent, Dan. By the time she was twenty-five, she could speak six languages fluently, handle a spear or boomerang or rifle with equal skill, and navigate almost every major city in the world. She knew my hometown of Seoul better than I did. Then, for reasons unknown, she came back to Massachusetts to settle down. A woman of mystery -- that was Grace.\"\n Dan wanted to hear more about Grace\u0027s boomerang skills. That sounded sweet! But Amy stepped away from the bookcase. Her face was bright red. \"A-Alistair. Uh ... what do you want?\"\n \"Oh, don\u0027t let me stop you. I won\u0027t interfere.\"\n \"Um, but... there\u0027s nothing here,\" Amy mumbled. \"I was hoping for ... I don\u0027t know.\n Something I hadn\u0027t seen before, but I\u0027ve read most of these. There really aren\u0027t that many books. And there\u0027s nothing about Richards-.\"\n \"My dear children, may I suggest something? We need an alliance.\"\n Dan was immediately suspicious. \"Why would you want an alliance with a couple of kids?\"\n The old man chuckled. \"You have intelligence and youth, and a fresh way of looking at things. I, on the other hand, have resources and age. I may not be one of the most famous Cahills, but I did change the world in my own small way. You know my fortune comes from inventions, eh? Did you know I invented the microwavable burrito?\"\n \"Wow,\" Dan said. \"Earth-shattering.\"\n \"There\u0027s no need to thank me. The point is I have resources at my disposal. And you can\u0027t travel around the world on your own, you know. You\u0027ll need an adult chaperone.\"\n Around the world?\n Dan hadn\u0027t thought about that. He hadn\u0027t even been allowed to go on the fourth grade field trip to New York last spring because he\u0027d put Mentos in his Spanish teacher\u0027s Diet Coke. The idea that this clue hunt might take them anywhere in the world made him feel a little lightheaded.\n \"But -- but we can\u0027t help each other,\" Amy said. \"Each team is separate.\"\n Alistair spread his hands. \"We can\u0027t both win.\n But this challenge may take weeks, perhaps months. Until the end, surely we can collaborate? We are family, after all.\"\n \"So give us some help,\" Dan decided. \"There\u0027s nothing here about Richard S___ .\n Where do we look?\"\n Alistair tapped his cane on the floor. \"Grace was a secretive woman. But she loved books. She loved them very much. And you\u0027re right, Amy. It does seem strange there are so few of them here.\"\n \"You think she had more books?\" Amy cupped her hand over her mouth. \"A ... a secret library?\"\n Alistair shrugged. \"It\u0027s a large house. We could split up and search.\"\n But then Dan noticed something -- one of those random little details that often caught his eye. On the wall, at the very top of the bookshelf, was a plaster crest just like above the front door of the mansion, a fancy C surrounded by four smaller coats of arms -- a dragon, a bear, a wolf, and a pair of snakes wrapped around a sword. He must\u0027ve seen this before a million times, but he\u0027d never noticed that the smaller crests each had a letter carved in the middle -- E, T, J, L.\n \"Get me a ladder,\" he said.\n \"What?\" Alistair asked.\n \"Never mind,\" Dan decided. He began to climb the shelf, knocking down books and knickknacks.\n \"Dan, get down!\" Amy protested. \"You\u0027re going to fall and break your arm again! \"\n Dan had reached the crest, and he saw what to do. The letters were smudged darker than the rest of the stone, like they\u0027d been touched many times. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-5.html","bookId":1546,"book":{"id":1546,"title":"The Maze of Bones ( The 39 Clues #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Maze of Bones (The 39 Clues #1) \n Minutes before she died Grace Cahill changed her will, leaving her decendants an impossible decision: You have a choice - one million dollars or a clue. \n Grace is the last matriarch of the Cahills, the world\u0027s most powerful family.
