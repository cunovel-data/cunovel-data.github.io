{"id":107143,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Travel?\" Dan said. \"Where are we going?\"\n Amy glanced at the cop. She leaned closer to Dan and whispered, \"First, we need to find a chaperone. And quickly.\n Aunt Beatrice is going to call Social Services soon. We need to get home, get our stuff, and get out. If the police find out we\u0027ve been disowned, they\u0027ll take us to a foster home or something. We\u0027ll never be able to find the thirty-nine clues.\"\n Dan hadn\u0027t thought about this. He didn\u0027t know much about foster homes, but he figured he didn\u0027t want to live in one. Would a foster home let him take his collection?\n Probably not.\n \"So how do we get an adult?\" he asked. \"Rent one?\"\n Amy twisted her hair into a noose. \"We need somebody who\u0027ll let us do what we want without asking too many questions. Somebody old enough to look like we\u0027re being chaperoned, but not strict enough that they\u0027ll try to stop us. Somebody kind of pliable.\"\n \"Does \u0027pliable\u0027 mean we can lie to them?\"\n \"Mrrp,\" Saladin said, like that sounded good to him as long as he got fresh fish.\n The police car turned onto Melrose Street and pulled up in front of their weathered brownstone apartment building.\n \"This is the address?\" the cop asked. She sounded bored and annoyed.\n \"Yes,\" Amy said. \"I mean, yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"You sure there\u0027s somebody home? Your guardian or whatever?\"\n \"Nellie Gomez,\" Dan said. \"She\u0027s our au pa -- \"\n His eyes widened. He looked at Amy, and he could tell she was thinking the same thing. It was so obvious even a Holt could\u0027ve seen it.\n \"Nellie!\" they said together. They got out of the police car with their cat and the jewelry box and raced up the front steps.\n Nellie was just where Dan figured she\u0027d be -- sacked out on the sofa with her earbuds in, bobbing her head to whatever weird music she was listening to while she punched text messages into her phone. A stack of cookbooks sat next to her on the couch. The top one read Exotic Mandarin Cuisine.\n Dan let Saladin down to explore the apartment. Then he noticed the empty carton of Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Cherry Garcia -- his Cherry Garcia -- sitting on the coffee table.\n \"Hey!\" Dan protested. \"That was mine!\" Of course, Nellie didn\u0027t hear him. She kept jamming out and typing on her phone until Amy and Dan stood right over her.\n Nellie frowned like she was annoyed she had to actually work. She pulled out one earbud. \"Back already? Whoa -- what happened? You\u0027re all grungy.\"\n \"We need to talk,\" Amy said.\n Nellie blinked, which was pretty cool to watch since her eyes were done in blue glitter eye shadow. She had a new nose ring shaped like a silver snake. Dan wondered why she wanted a snake curled inside her nostril.\n \"What do we need to talk about, kiddo?\" she asked.\n Amy looked like she wanted to hit Nellie with the jewelry box. Dan knew she hated it when Nellie called her kiddo, but she kept her voice polite.\n \"We -- we\u0027ve got a deal for you. A new babysitting deal. It pays a lot of money.\"\n Nellie pulled out her other earbud. They had her attention now. Three words always worked with Nellie: guys, food, and money.\n She stood up. She was wearing her ripped British flag T-shirt, faded jeans, and pink plastic shoes. Her hair looked like a pile of wet straw -- half black, half blond.\n She folded her arms and looked down at Amy. \"Okay. What kind of deal?\"\n Dan was afraid Amy would freeze up, but she seemed to be keeping her nerves pretty well. Nellie wasn\u0027t as intimidating as some of the other au pairs they\u0027d had.\n \"Urn ... it\u0027s a trip,\" Amy said. \"You\u0027d be our chaperone.\"\n Nellie frowned. \"Why isn\u0027t your aunt asking me about this?\"\n \"Oh, she broke her neck,\" Dan blurted out.\n Amy gave him a look like\n Shut up!\n \"Broke her neck?\" Nellie asked.\n \"It\u0027s not serious,\" Dan said. \"Just a little break. She\u0027s, uh, going to be in the hospital for a while, though. So she figured we\u0027d better take a trip. We talked to our Uncle Alistair. He said we\u0027d need an adult to go with us.\"\n That last part, at least, was true. Dan didn\u0027t know where he was going with this, but he plunged ahead. He figured if he could just keep Nellie confused, she couldn\u0027t call him a liar.\n \"It\u0027s this thing our family does,\" he said. \"Kind of like a scavenger hunt. We visit a bunch of places and have fun.\"\n \"What sort of places?\" Nellie asked.\n \"Oh, all kinds.\" Dan thought about the map in Grace\u0027s secret library -- all those pushpins. \"That\u0027s part of the fun. We don\u0027t know all the places at the beginning. We could go all over the world.\"\n Nellie\u0027s eyebrows shot up. \"You mean, like, for free?\"\n Amy nodded, as if she were warming up to Dan\u0027s methods. \"Yeah, it could take months! Traveling to exotic places where there\u0027s lots of ... um, food and guys. But you wouldn\u0027t need to be with us the whole time -- just for the adult stuff like buying airline tickets and checking into hotels and stuff. You\u0027d have a lot of time on your own.\"\n Yes, please, Dan thought. Nellie was okay, but the last thing he wanted was her following them around too closely.\n \"How are you going to pay for it?\" Nellie said suspiciously.\n Amy opened the jewelry box and dumped it on the table. The pearl bracelet, the diamond ring, and the emerald earrings glittered.\n Nellie\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"Oh -- my -- god. Did you steal that?\"\n \"No!\" Amy said. \"It\u0027s from our grandmother! She wanted us to take this trip. She said so in her will.\"\n Dan felt impressed. That wasn\u0027t exactly a lie, either.\n Nellie stared at the jewelry. Then she picked up her phone and dialed.\n Dan tensed. He had visions of Social Services -- whatever that was -- swooping in, guys with white coats and nets, maybe, taking them to a foster home.\n \"Hello?\" Nellie said into the phone. \"Yeah, Dad, listen, I\u0027ve got a new job for the Cahills.\"\n Pause.\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s really good money. So I can\u0027t make dinner tonight like I promised.\" Nellie picked up the diamond ring, but Amy snatched it away. \"How long? Um ... we\u0027re traveling. So a few weeks. Maybe ... months?\"\n She yanked the phone away from her ear. On the other end, her dad was yelling in rapid Spanish.\n \"Dad!\" Nellie said.\n \"No, claw. But the fall semester doesn\u0027t start for a month, and it\u0027s all, like, boring courses anyway.\n I could just take more hours in the spring and -- \"\n Another burst of angry Spanish.\n \"Well, if you\u0027d let me go to cooking school instead of stupid regular college -- \"\n Her dad\u0027s yelling got slightly louder than a nuclear explosion.\n \"Que, papa?\"\n Nellie yelled.\n \"Lo siento, you\u0027re breaking up. I\u0027ll call you when I get a better signal. Love ya!\" She hung up.\n \"He\u0027s fine with it,\" she announced. \"I\u0027m in, kiddos.\"\n On Amy\u0027s orders, Dan was only supposed to pack one bag. That meant clothes, but Dan wasn\u0027t interested in clothes. He looked around his room, trying to figure out what to take from his collections.\n His bedroom was already way too small for his stuff. Against one wall were his tombstone rubbings. He\u0027d have to roll them up or fold them to pack them, and that would ruin them. His closet was stacked with plastic bins holding his card collection and coin portfolios -- too many to choose from. Under his bed were boxes full of old Civil War weapons, his casts, his autographed celebrity photos, and a ton of other stuff.\n He picked up his laptop, which he\u0027d bought from the computer science teacher at school for $300. He\u0027d have to take that, because he used it to find out stuff and make money. He knew the exact value of every trading card on the Internet. He\u0027d learned to sell his duplicate cards at school and in the local card shops for a little more than he\u0027d paid. It wasn\u0027t much, but he could make about $100 a month if he was lucky. And he was lucky. Unfortunately, he spent the money on rare stuff as fast as he made it.\n He slipped the computer into his black duffel bag. Then he added three extra shirts, pants, underwear, a toothbrush, his inhaler, and -- finally -- his passport.\n Their parents had gotten them passports right before they died, when Dan was four.\n Dan didn\u0027t remember why. They\u0027d never used them. Grace had insisted on renewing them last year, which had seemed kind of sil y to Dan at the time. Now he wondered....\n He shoved the passport to the bottom of the bag. There was hardly any room left.\n No way could he fit even a tenth of his stuff.\n He dug under his mattress and brought out his photo album. It was a big white binder holding his most important collection: photos of his parents.\n There was only one. It was burned around the edges: the only photograph that had survived the fire. His mom and dad were standing on the summit of a mountain with their arms around each other, smiling for the camera. They both wore Gortex parkas and thermal climbing pants, with harnesses around their waists. Instead of helmets, they wore baseball caps, so their eyes were hidden in shadows. His dad, Arthur, was tall and tan with salt-and-pepper hair and a nice smile. Dan wondered if he would look like that when he got older. His mom, Hope, had reddish-brown hair like Amy\u0027s. She was a little younger than their dad, and Dan thought she was very pretty. Her hat was an Orioles cap. His dad\u0027s was a Red Sox. Dan wondered if that was random, or if those were their favorite teams, and if they ever fought about which one was better. He didn\u0027t know. He didn\u0027t even know if they had green eyes like he did, because the caps hid their faces.\n He wanted to collect other photos of them. He wanted to know where else they traveled and what they wore. He wanted to see a picture that had him in it. But there was nothing to collect. Everything from their old house had burned, and Grace always insisted she had no photographs of them, though Dan never understood why.\n He stared at the photo and got a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He thought about the fire at Grace\u0027s mansion, the man in black, Mr. McIntyre lying on the pavement, Uncle Alistair driving away like a madman, and his mom\u0027s handwriting in that Benjamin Franklin book.\n What could be so important about a book? Dan knew the value of a lot of collectibles, but he\u0027d never heard of anything worth burning down a house.\n Grace must\u0027ve known what she was doing, setting up this contest. She wouldn\u0027t have let him and Amy down. Dan told himself that over and over, trying to believe it.\n There was a knock on his door. He took the plastic sleeve with the photograph out of the album and slipped it in his bag. He zipped it shut just as the door opened.\n \"Hey, dweeb,\" Amy said, but she didn\u0027t really sound mean. \"You almost done?\"\n \"Yeah. Yeah, I\u0027m good.\"\n She\u0027d taken a shower and changed clothes -- back into her regular jeans and green T-shirt. She frowned at his full duffel bag, then looked at all the bins sitting in the closet. Dan guessed she could tell he hadn\u0027t sorted through them.\n \"You could, uh, take a backpack, too,\" she offered. \"If that helps.\"\n Coming from Amy, it was a pretty nice thing to say. But Dan stared at his closet.\n Somehow he knew he wouldn\u0027t be coming back here ever again. \"Amy, how much money do you think we\u0027ll get for the jewelry?\"\n Her hand went to her neck, and Dan realized she was wearing Grace\u0027s jade necklace.\n \"Um ... I don\u0027t know.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-8.html","bookId":1546,"book":{"id":1546,"title":"The Maze of Bones ( The 39 Clues #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Maze of Bones (The 39 Clues #1) \n Minutes before she died Grace Cahill changed her will, leaving her decendants an impossible decision: You have a choice - one million dollars or a clue. \n Grace is the last matriarch of the Cahills, the world\u0027s most powerful family.
