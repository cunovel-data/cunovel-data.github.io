{"id":89444,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"To Molly, Gard, Chiron and Guenevere PART ONE Because she was Chalice she stood at the front door with the Grand Seneschal, the Overlord\u0027s agent and the Prelate, all of whom were carefully ignoring her. But she was Chalice, and it was from her hand the Master would take the welcome cup. From the front door of the House, at the top of the magnificent curling sweep of stair, she could see over the heads of the crowd. The rest of the Circle stood stiffly and formally at the foot of the stair with the first Houseman and the head gardener, but nearly the entire citizenry of the demesne seemed to have found an excuse to be somewhere in or near the House or lining the long drive from the gates today. Their new Master was coming home: the Master thought lost or irrecoverable. The Master who, as younger brother of the previous Master, had been sent off to the priests of Fire, to get rid of him. Third and fourth brothers of Masters were often similarly disposed of, but the solitary brother of an unmarried Master without other Heir should not have been dealt with so summarily. So the Master had been told. But the two brothers hated each other, and the younger one was given to the priests of Fire. That had been seven years ago. A little over six years later the Master died, still without other Heir. The Grand Seneschal had sent immediately to the priests of Fire to say that there was urgent need of the younger brother of the Master of Willowlands, for the Master had died without having produced a son. Such a request - a plea - had never been made before. Once someone has gone to the Elemental priests, they do not return. But a demesne must have its Master. And a change of family, of bloodline, in any demesne, upsets all, often for generations, till the new family has settled into its charge. The nearest other living relative of the old Master of Willowlands was a fourth cousin who had already married someone unsuitable and had three children by her. The priests of Fire said they would see what they could do, but they promised nothing. The younger brother of the old Master had just crossed into the third level, and by the third level Elemental priests can no longer live among ordinary humans. But six weeks ago the Grand Seneschal had received another message from the priests of Fire: that the Master of Willowlands was coming home. It would not be an easy Mastership, and the priests were not sure it was even possible, but the Master himself felt the responsibility to his demesne, and he was determined to try. Mirasol - straining her eyes toward the gate, partly as a way to ignore the three men who were ignoring her - remembered the younger brother: his strength of purpose, his feeling of obligation to the demesne, his feeling for the demesne. It was what the brothers had quarrelled about. The elder brother had loved the power of the Mastership, not its duties, and he was not the least willing to bear lectures on his behaviour from his younger brother. She wasn\u0027t surprised the younger brother was coming home, even from the third level of the priesthood of Fire. She had dreamed of the message to the Grand Seneschal the night before it arrived: she had felt the fire and smelt the burning. She knew the Master would come. She knew too that the smell of burning was a warning, but she did not know of what. Might the demesne itself burn, or its new Master? She could see only a little way down the drive as it curved toward the gates half a league distant. But she could see when people better placed than she for first sight of the arrival stiffened and stared. The three men standing with her drew themselves to attention. She could hear carriage wheels now. It will be all right, she told herself. It must be all right. She settled her shoulders with a tiny, invisible shake, and fractionally raised her chin. Six horses drew the coach: four of them coal-black, clinker-black, two of them ashy grey. The coach itself was also black, but black was always fashionable among the great and grand and would draw no comment. But the curtains at these windows were drawn closed, and they too were black. A light flickered behind them, red and wavering, like firelight. Again she smelt burning, but she did not know if she imagined it. The welcoming of a new Master was a time of rejoicing. The ceremony of investiture was the official occasion, and after the rites were done there was an enormous banquet with musicians and dancing for everyone who belonged to the demesne - and for anyone else from any other demesne who wished to join in the festivities at the price of some enthusiastic contribution to toasts and cheers and acclamations. But the informal arrival of a Master should still be a happy moment. And she knew she was not the only person present who felt that the brothers had been born in the wrong order: it was the younger who would have made the better Master from the beginning. But no one clapped or called. No one smiled. It was as if everyone was holding their breath. The coach stopped in front of the House, where the gravel had been raked in a perfect circle, a symbol of good luck. Any coach wheels and any horses\u0027 hooves would have broken the circle, splintered the careful spiral; that it should be so broken was a part of the welcome, like opening and pouring out the contents of a bottle of wine. There was no reason for her to feel uneasy, watching the horses dance as they halted, kicking pebbles every way, to feel that something fragile and vital was being destroyed. The body of the coach rocked on its wheels, and little spurts of gravel pattered out from under them. Then the door opened. Perhaps she imagined the cloud of darkness like smoke that billowed out; no one else reacted, and she bit down on her own gulp of astonishment. And of sudden fear. She remembered the younger brother. She had not known him - it was not for such a one as she had been to know the Master\u0027s family - but she had known a good deal of him. She had known more of him than of the Master, before the Master sent him away, because he was the one who rode or walked round the demesne, seeing that the fields and woods grew and throve, and the temples and places of power were serene and well tended. He was not tall and handsome and flashing-eyed like his older brother, but there was kindness and grace in him, and intelligence in his unremarkable brown eyes. She knew little of the Elemental priests, nothing of their initiations, and only folk-tales of what the priesthoods did and were capable of. She knew that Fire frightened her worst, more than Earth or Air. And the Fire priests themselves had said that Willowlands\u0027 new Master could no longer live among ordinary humans. As the coach door swung back, one of the House servants jumped forward as if suddenly recalling himself, and lowered the steps. Two figures climbed carefully down. They both wore black capes with hoods that hid their faces, but they carried themselves and moved and looked around as anyone might. As any ordinary human might. There was a collective letting-out of breath. Talisman, the tallest of the minor Circle, seemed suddenly shorter; Sunbrightener, who was the fattest, seemed fatter. That was until the third figure climbed down from the coach. He too wore a black cape with a hood, but the cape bulged and seethed weirdly around him, and he let himself carefully down the steps as if he did not know or could not remember how to use his feet for such an activity. The two figures who had climbed down first reached their hands to help him, holding him at the elbows and under the arms, but she felt, looking on, that their hands did not grasp quite where elbows and armpits should be. He half limped, half rolled up the steps toward the House\u0027s front door with his helpers still on his either side. She seemed to hear a distant roar, like a fire caught in a sudden updraft. She wanted to glance at the faces of the other people, the people who had come here this morning to catch a first glimpse of their new Master, wanted to see if they looked frightened or appalled. But she couldn\u0027t drag her own gaze away from the great roiling black loom of the third figure coming toward her. She felt the three men standing beside her struggling not to step back and away as she stepped forward. She had been clutching the welcome cup against her body so tightly that her stomach ached where the extravagantly ornamented brim had bitten into her. The roughness of the intricate overlay on the cup\u0027s bowl gave her suddenly cold stiff fingers better purchase as she moved her hands to their proper places on its stem. She was Chalice, and hers the first greeting. The top step was a wide smooth half-moon of white stone before the door. There was plenty of space for her and him and his two aides, as well as the three men behind her, and the doorkeepers back farther yet, flanking the doorposts. She raised her cup, grateful that the weight of it prevented her hands from shaking, and looked down. Three faces turned up toward her, two of them brown and ordinary and worried-looking. The third face was black, as black as the coal-coloured horses that drew the black coach, and its - his - eyes were red, flickering like fire around the black pupils. She recognised nothing in that face from her memories of the younger brother of the dead Master. She looked at him steadily, willing herself to see something - anything - that she could welcome as Master, and in the final seconds it took him to climb the last step, she saw what she needed to see: comprehension. He knew her for Chalice and knew she was there to welcome him, because he came as Master. When he stood with her on the top step he gave a little shudder, or ripple, and his two aides dropped their hands and stepped back. As they let go of him she saw that they wore gloves. Her mouth was dry, as dry as if she had been eating ash, and she was slow to say the two important words: \"Welcome, Master.\" She was slow, but he was slower. He should reach immediately to take the cup from her, hold it briefly over his head for everyone to see that he accepted it, taste its contents and hand it back to her. It was possible that he would thank her, but it was not necessary. But he only stood, looking at her. The hood shadowed his shadow-dark face; she thought she was glad of it. He twitched, a tiny spasm, once, twice. Perhaps he was trying to raise his hands. The third time he succeeded, the sleeves of the cape juddering back as if blown by a wind, and she saw that he too wore gloves, long heavy ones, laced snugly to the elbows. She could not give any Chalice cup to gloved hands. She looked back into his face - into the shadows where his face was. She did not know what to do. She thought she must have imagined the comprehension she had seen there a moment earlier; she could read no expression on that black face now. Clumsily he raised his left hand and drew the fingers through the laces of the glove on his right. The cords fell away in uneven shards, as if charred. Slowly he peeled the glove away from his arm - and the heat of his flesh raged out at her. The air between them was almost too hot to breathe. Even more clumsily he raised his naked right hand, the fingertips glowing like embers, to touch the cup. She held her ground while the fingers of that fiery hand curled round the bowl of the cup inches from her face. The enamelled metal of the goblet grew uncomfortably warm against her skin and steam rose from the liquid within it. The weight of the cup did not change and she supported it as he stood with his hand around it. He looked at it and back at her. \"What...do you give...me to drink?\" His voice was as eerie as his appearance, but perfectly intelligible. Her answer to this question had been in no record she had consulted about the rite of welcome; but then no one had ever welcomed a third-level Elemental priest as Master either. She had held her own against the preferences of the Prelate and the Grand Seneschal only because she was, in the end, Chalice, and they could not order her to give him the earthed wine customary for a welcome cup. But she had not expected to have to announce publicly her departure from tradition: only the Master himself would taste the contents of his welcome cup. She felt as if she were being wayward, unreasonable and oblivious all over again when she had to reply, \"Water - plain water from the Ladywell - and a spoonful of honey, Master.\" She was sure - she was almost sure - she did not imagine it that he smiled. And it was only after her answer that she felt him begin to draw the cup toward himself. Still he did not - or could not - bear its weight, and so she carried it for him. Together they made only a faint gesture of holding it above his head, for the audience to see; and then she tipped it gently against his mouth, and saw him drink; and also saw a tiny rivulet run down by the side of his mouth and hiss off his chin, briefly leaving a fire-red tracing thread behind it. He let her draw the cup back toward her again with his hand still around it. She looked again into his face and saw, though she could not have explained how she saw, that he was tired, tired almost to death; and so she knew that it was only weariness that made him clumsier still, that when he lifted his hand away from the cup, he was not able to do it cleanly, and his hand dropped a little, and glanced - only barely, fleetingly glanced - off the back of her hand, where it seared the thin flesh to the bone. At the time it almost didn\u0027t matter. She found that she had been half expecting something like it to happen, and did not flinch when it did. She lowered the goblet only a little bit hastily, and tucked the weight of it against her body again so that she could drop her wounded hand to her side and let the long sleeve of her robe cover the burn. This made it throb worse than if she could have held it up, but that couldn\u0027t be helped. No one farther away than the three men behind her awaiting their turn - and possibly the Master\u0027s two aides - would have seen anything, and she wished to keep it that way. But the three men waiting just behind her would have seen. The Grand Seneschal might have kept his mouth shut for his own good - it was he who had negotiated with the priests of Fire in the first place, and he who had received the news that the priests did not believe what he was asking could be done. She didn\u0027t know the Prelate well enough to guess after his motives, beyond a growing suspicion he had few of his own and preferred to borrow them from some stronger character. But the Overlord\u0027s agent would have every reason to tell the tale - and doubtless had. While it would upset the balance of the entire country if one of the demesnes were realloted, the process of the reallotment would hugely increase this Overlord\u0027s power, and bind the new Master to the Overlord with a political gratitude it would take generations of Masters and Overlords to bring into equilibrium again. And their current Overlord was a little too fond of political power - she among others believed - without such temptations as a Master who might burn his subjects by the touch of his hand. By the end of the first day of the new Master\u0027s return, the people she met were looking first at her right hand. Gossip travels as fast as fire. By then she had dressed and bandaged it, so there was nothing to see but the bandage; but that was enough. And there was no way to shrug off what had happened as an accident. Of course it had been an accident: no Master could remain Master who deliberately harmed any of his people. What had happened to her should be viewed as no worse or more significant than if one of his coach horses had shied and trodden on one of the onlookers: an unfortunate mishap. That\u0027s all. But of course it was not, for it was not an accident that should have been able to happen. If the new Master were not a priest of Fire. If the new Master were still human. \"It is nothing,\" she said to the people she caught looking at her hand. \"It is nothing.\" Sometimes she tried to smile. She\u0027d smiled at Sama, when she\u0027d asked for lint and salve; Sama was a Housewoman with a round, happy face and three children, and she and her children were excellent customers for Mirasol\u0027s honey. \"I was clumsy. It is no more than if I brushed my hand against a dish just out of the oven.\" \"It don\u0027t look like nothing,\" said Sama, whose round face was not happy today. \"And oven burns hurt.\" \"Of course they hurt,\" Mirasol said briskly, trying to be competent with one hand and failing. \"But we bear them because we are clumsy - and because we still like our food cooked.\" Sama\u0027s face closed a little more, but she did reach out to help Mirasol with her bandage. \"It is not as though we had had a chance to practise our roles,\" Mirasol said, trying to make a joke, but she realised as soon as the words were out of her mouth they were a mistake. Usually a new Master was well known to the demesne; usually the Chalice\u0027s welcome cup to the Master entering his House as Master for the first time was a formality only. Usually a new Master was human. \"But - \" Sama began. \"He is our Master,\" said Mirasol firmly. There was an uncomfortable pause while Sama finished tying up the bandage. When she was done she raised her eyes to Mirasol\u0027s and said, \"As Chalice wills.\" Mirasol almost blurted out, It\u0027s not what I will! It is what has happened! A few months ago she would have spoken so, spoken before she thought, a few months ago when her Chalicehood was still so new that every reminder of it was like a burn. But she was Chalice now, and all things had changed, herself most of all. Before the Chalice had chosen her, Sama would have argued with her; would have held her own opinion against Mirasol\u0027s. She would not argue with her Chalice; it was her duty to accept the Chalice\u0027s ruling. Mirasol hoped she was right. She told herself it would have been worse if it had been an ordinary accident like a coach horse blundering into the audience, because that would so clearly have been a bad omen. The new Master was a priest of Fire, and adjustments had to be made. That\u0027s all. That\u0027s all. She could not help the bandage on her hand, but once she realised there was no point in trying to hide it, she used that hand freely, as if it did not hurt her. She had to hope that the fixed expression on her face that this usage provoked - because it did hurt a great deal - only looked like the Chalice\u0027s professional mask. But if their new Master believed he could be Master, then she wanted him to have his chance. In the first place this was only her duty: the Master was the Master, but no Master could maintain his land without his Chalice. But in the second place she wanted this Master to grasp and hold because these first six months of her abrupt and lonely Chalicehood had been almost beyond her strength. She did not think she would be able to bear - to contain - the tumult if Willowlands were given a new, outblood Master; and she did not think this or any demesne could survive an outblood Master and a second disastrously new, inexperienced and untrained Chalice together. It was bad enough as it was. Willowlands was restless, hurt and unhappy: half mad with it, she sometimes thought, delirious as a child with a bad fever. Whether this was a result of being Masterless for seven months or from the seven years preceding the previous Master\u0027s death it was impossible for her to say. But she knew it was also because she, the new Chalice, was herself rough and raw from having had no teaching. She thought of her Chalicehood in wild metaphors: like a blind woman asked to paint a portrait; like a scullery-maid dragged out of her kitchen, given a plough with no horse and told to raise six hectares of barley by sundown. And yet if she lost her fragile balance as a result of an outblood Master and the Chalice passed to someone else, there was no vanity in her bleak awareness that this would be a catastrophe. She had learnt enough to begin piecing together ways to calm a little of the appalling strain and distress the deaths of the last Master and Chalice had caused. But she had learnt by precarious methods: feverishly reading the old books, following her nose through the footnotes and annotations, leaning hardest on the advice of the oftenest-cited manuscripts, when she could find them, when the House library or the old Chalice\u0027s rooms contained copies of them, guessing miserably from scraps and fragments when she could not find what she needed. The changeover from Master to Master and Chalice to Chalice should never happen - had never happened - as it had just happened here; most of the information and guidance she needed simply didn\u0027t exist. And she had only barely begun. She still had far more questions than answers, far more unknowing than knowing, about everything to do with Chalice work. And yet she was all there was. The people rarely came to her with their individual problems and disturbances, but while this meant she was not yet well accepted as Chalice, which was in itself unsettling to the land and its people, she had as much and more than she could do merely responding to the most savage ruptures in the fabric of the demesne. And she felt as if she were using embroidery silks to mend plaster and lath. No, she thought, that\u0027s not it. It\u0027s more like putting out fires: like harvesttime after a dry summer. And they were in a drought that might destroy all. Sometimes the demesne\u0027s disquiet manifested as literal tremors of the ground, when the trees shook as if in a high wind, plates flew off shelves, and fences didn\u0027t merely fall down but burst apart. Usually she could hear these in her mind if they were too far away for her feet to feel them. Sometimes the Grand Seneschal sent her a message. (She tried to tell herself this was an indication of some measure of approval, but she feared it was only that as Seneschal he knew what she, who was Second of the entire Circle, second to the Master himself, ought to be capable of. The Grand Seneschal was only Third: but she never remembered this when he was glaring at her, or when another of his brusquely worded messages arrived.) The rest of the Circle were little use. The violence of the deaths seven months ago had damaged and disrupted all their abilities as it had damaged and disrupted everything to do with the demesne; only the Grand Seneschal had pulled himself together again to take the full weight of his place in the demesne framework. Once, only a few days before the homecoming of the new Master, a farmer, Faine, had come thundering up to her cottage on the back of one of his work-horses, still wearing its ordinary harness and looking as wretched and confused as its master. She\u0027d heard the commotion and come outdoors - even her bees had scattered out of the way of these tumultuous visitors. She knew Faine; he was almost a neighbour. Possibly he had come to her because she was Chalice; much likelier he had come to her because of all the Circle she was nearest. \"Can you come now?\" he said breathlessly. She thought his eyes weren\u0027t focusing on her face: perhaps seeing the thing that he had left behind him. \"There\u0027s a great cut opening in one of my fields,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve left my brothers getting the beasts away - it\u0027s big enough for one to fall in. And it\u0027s growing.\" He was speaking as if past her, as if looking at someone standing behind her. He was old enough, she thought, to remember the Chalice before the last one - she who had been Chalice to the father of the new Master and his brother. That Chalice had been much loved; Mirasol\u0027s father had consulted her once about a stand of trees that did not thrive as they should. \"There was something wrong about the air around them,\" he\u0027d said. \"You could smell it as soon as you stood among \u0027em. I tried Oakstaff first, but he hadn\u0027t the time for the likes of me - but Chalice herself came.\" Mirasol knew of her own experience that these trees were now among the finest in what had been her father\u0027s woodright. That Chalice would have known what to do. But that Chalice had never had to grapple with her demesne in the conditions Mirasol faced. \"A moment,\" she said, and flew back indoors. A tremor so ferocious it had ripped the mundane ground apart? She had no idea what she should do, but she had to try to do something. She snatched up the cup of balance, three of the Chalice stones that worked well with it, a handful of herbs, and thrust two pots of honey in the pockets of her cloak. She hesitated over her book of basic incantations; but basic incantations did not include crevasses opening in fields, and watching her fumble uselessly through a book would be good for neither Faine and his brothers nor herself. Her best hope was that the earthlines might tell her something she could use. The journey to Faine\u0027s farm was so uncomfortable, holding on to the hip strap till her fingers were sore to keep herself from being jolted off by the big horse\u0027s bone-breaking trot, that she managed to avoid thinking about what she could do when they arrived. She didn\u0027t know what she could do. She might as well think about her sore fingers and bruised seatbones. It was worse than she imagined and, she thought, glancing at Faine\u0027s face, worse than it had been when he had left to fetch help. A great ragged cleft had torn its way through the flat grassy pastureland; the red-brown gash looked eerily like a wound in flesh. Part of the awfulness of it was that the rest of the scene seemed so normal: the sun shone, the birds sang in the trees. The end near them was perhaps only two hands\u0027-breadth across, but Mirasol could see it widened swiftly farther down the field. As she slid stiffly off the horse and her feet touched the ground, the ground shivered, like a horse\u0027s skin shedding flies; the tuft of grass at the end of the trench rocked wildly and then parted with a sound like tearing cloth, and the trench was suddenly a hand\u0027s-breadth longer. The birdsong faltered, and then took up again. Mirasol barely noticed; she was listening to the earthlines. Two passed through Faine\u0027s field, and they were weeping like children. She looked around, and broke a small twig off an oak tree, thanking the tree for its help. She always preferred to find something she could use at the location itself, and she liked oak for Chalice work. She brushed her fingers over its leaves and murmured a few words of dedication. The now-familiar ritual was a little soothing - but what next? Two men and a woman had seen them coming, and met them at the edge of the injured field, but the keening of the earthlines in Mirasol\u0027s ears was so loud it was almost impossible to hear human speech. \"...the rest of them out,\" one man was saying. \"...Daisy\u0027s calf ran in the wrong direction, and Daisy followed,\" said the other man. \"They\u0027re...\" And then, as if the moaning of the earthlines was a curtain and they had parted it for her, Mirasol could hear the frightened bellowing of the trapped cow. \"Get a rope,\" Mirasol heard her own voice saying. \"Two ropes. You may have to drag them out. Your horse has a yokemate, I assume? Fetch him. How has this - rift - opened? Does it stretch from one end, or out from the middle?\" \"The far end,\" quavered the woman. \"It began there. Where Daisy is.\" \"Good,\" said Mirasol\u0027s voice again. \"That makes it easier.\" It does? thought Mirasol. The earthlines whimpered. \"Where is your spring?\" Every farm in Willowlands had a spring; she hoped this one would be a strong one, and near at hand. \"Bring me a flask of the water - freshly drawn - as quick as you can.\" The woman turned and ran. Mirasol walked to the edge of the field, took a deep breath, and climbed the fence. She was immediately deafened by the lament of the earthlines. It was not only the two in the field who spoke; the earthlines in the entire quadrant echoed their distress. She walked slowly along the length of the cleft; would she notice in time, she thought, if it decided to widen suddenly? She fished the cup of balance out of her pocket and rubbed her fingers over it; it was very difficult keeping her own balance between the strange space where the earthlines moved and spoke and the fact that if the crack opened under her feet in the mundane world, she\u0027d fall into it. She tried to listen through the earthlines\u0027 misery for any sign or guide: What was the cut doing here? Why was it here in this field rather than in some other field? Why was it here at all? Broken, wept the earthlines. Broken, broken. Some of the groaning, she thought, was the ground itself, splitting, tearing itself from itself. She was staring into the far end, where it was deepest - probably the height of two tall men, she guessed, easily enough to imprison a cow and her calf - when the woman came with a flask of icy spring water, and shortly after her one of Faine\u0027s brothers with a pair of horses. Mirasol mixed her cup: water, the spring water this field would know, herbs for distress of mind and body and one for deep dangerous wounds that they will not fester; some of this year\u0027s spring honey, because spring was the season of joy for the future, and some honey tasting strongly of handflowers. Handflowers were lavender-pink, and inside they were striped red in such a way that they resembled the fingers and thumbs of two hands held cupped together. It was considered lucky to drink rainwater from the cups of handflowers - and anyone who regularly did then saw all things so clearly that they could not be deceived. I will not deceive you, said Mirasol silently to the earthlines. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing, but I\u0027m here and I\u0027m listening; and there is still joy in this world. She stirred the mixture with the oak twig. Last she dropped in the three small stones, which were for light in darkness, for compassion and for love. \"Someone will have to climb down there with them, you know, to put the ropes around them,\" she said. The man nodded. \"I know. I\u0027ll go.\" His face was pinched with worry and fear; he met her eyes, briefly, as if forgetting himself, and immediately looked away. \"Drink this first,\" Mirasol said, and offered him her cup. \"Just a sip - you only need a sip.\" The Chalice stones clinked faintly against the side of the cup as he drank. She turned away without waiting to see if her mixture had had any effect; she didn\u0027t have a second choice if it didn\u0027t. She knelt, and then lay down flat, just above where the unhappy cow bawled and thrashed. It was not a graceful procedure - what might the Chalice who had cured her father\u0027s trees have done about a trapped cow? Cows and sheep did get caught in natural cuts and hollows sometimes - but there was nothing natural about this one. She spilled several drops from her cup on the bits of cow that happened to be under them when they fell. At least once the sweet water landed on her nose - which was where she was aiming - and Mirasol saw the vast pink tongue reach up to lick it off. The calf, being smaller, and trying to hide under its mother, was harder, but she splashed it a few times. And then she stood up, as if what she wanted and hoped would happen was going to happen. The cow stopped bellowing. \"Go down now,\" she said. \"Get ready. I\u0027ll start at the far end: that\u0027ll give you a few minutes.\" She didn\u0027t add, I have no idea how long the effect will last. I have no idea why it worked. If it worked. Maybe the cow just likes the taste of honey. I have no idea if anything else will work. She turned away, and began again the long walk - it felt twice as long this second time - to the far end of the grotesque crack in the ground. The high dreadful keening of the earthlines had diminished to a woebegone rumble; a rumble that seemed to be turning toward her - looking for her - looking for help, as Faine had done. She knew the usual conjurations to quiet an earth tremor - often a mere murmur of silence and peace, quiet and calm was enough, like singing a lullaby to a fretful child - but these seemed hardly appropriate for an earthquake that had torn a hole in the landscape. But she found herself humming an old lullaby her mother had sung to her: Sleep, my little love, sleep, my little one. Sleep is sweet and love is sweeter, but honey is sweetest of all. There were several ritual ways a Chalice could hold her cup; she chose the one - only practical on the slender, stemmed Chalice vessels - that allowed her to weave the fingers of her two hands together around it while her crossed thumbs held the other side: connection, joining, linkage. She tried several phrases from the incantation book she had left behind, but none of them suited her; none of them felt right, none of them settled to the work before her. She felt the earthlines listening - listening but waiting. Waiting to hear the thing that would reassure them, that would knit them together, that would call them home. She reached the end of the crack and paused. It had, she noticed with some small relief, stopped growing. But when she turned and looked back along the length of it, it seemed leagues long; the two big work-horses as small as mice in the distance; the heavy ropes hanging off their harness and disappearing into the crack were barely visible threads. \"Please,\" she said clearly, aloud, as if she spoke to a person. \"Please be as you were. I will try to help you.\" She hesitated, and pulled out the handflower honey and added a little more to the mixture in her cup. The water was faintly gold against the silver cup; the small stones in the bottom shone like gems. She did not want gold and silver and gems; she wanted ordinary things, commonplace things. Trees and birdsong and sunlight, and unfractured earth. \"Let the earth knit together again, like - like darning a sock. Here are the threads to mend you with.\" And she threw a few drops from her cup into the trench. She saw them twinkle in the air as if they were tiny filaments; the pit was quite shallow here, and she could see tiny spots of darkness where they landed. Her fingers were sticky with honey. Absentmindedly she put one in her mouth; the taste of the herbs was clear and sharp, but the honey\u0027s complex sweetness seemed to carry mysteries. There was a sudden sharp new tremor under her feet. Her heart leaped into her throat and she froze. The jolt loosened the dirt on the sides of the trench, and it pattered down. Quite a lot of it pattered down, till the trench was barely a trench at all, little more than a slight hollow. \"Here are the threads to mend you with,\" she said again, having no better spell or command to offer, and she tossed more drops from her cup into the wound in the earth. The trench began to fill up.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chalice/page-1.html","bookId":2087,"book":{"id":2087,"title":"Chalice","description":"Storyline: Chalice was published in 2008. It was written by fantasy author Robin McKinley, who lives in England. McKinley has won several awards for her writing, some of which has been popular with young readers, and some with mature ones. Her work has been published for thirty years. She has re-told old fairy tales, and the story of Robin Hood, sub-created a country, Damar, in a world like some of the desert or near-desert parts of ours, except that there are dragons. In Chalice, she has written a book which takes place in a country that seems entirely of McKinley\u0027s creation, except that the culture approximates that of the Middle Ages. There are horses and carriages, but no steam engines, swords but no gunpowder.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/chalice.jpg","author":"Robin McKinley","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/chalice.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:37 PM"}}
