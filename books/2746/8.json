{"id":82991,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Hey!\" I cried again, to no avail, so I called upon my superspy heritage, and seconds later I was whistling loudly enough to make the cows come home (literally—that\u0027s why Grandpa Morgan taught me how to do it). My classmates finally turned away from Macey, and I said, \"It\u0027s time.\" A silence had fallen over the room, but then a longer, deeper quiet stretched out. We were through playing dress-up, and everyone knew it. \"Hello, ladies.\" The words were right, but the voice coming to us through the shadows was wrong in so many ways that I can\u0027t possibly describe it here. Really, it would be cruel to all the trees who would have to give their lives for me to explain what it was like to be expecting Joe Solomon and get Mr. Mosckowitz. \"Don\u0027t you all look very…\" He was staring, mouth gaping, as if he\u0027d never seen push-up bras or eyeliner before. \"…nice,\" he finally said, then slapped his hands together, I guess to stop the nervous shaking. But he still couldn\u0027t steady his voice as he said, \"Well, very big night. Very big. For…\" He hesitated. \"…all of us.\" Mr. Mosckowitz pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and stared beyond the lighted driveway of the mansion. Even I didn\u0027t know exactly what lay in that dark abyss. Sure, there are woods and jogging trails and a lacrosse field that is handy during Code Reds (and doubles as a great underground storage facility for the helicopters), but everyone knows the Gallagher Woods are a minefield—maybe literally—and I started shaking in my sensible shoes. What if there are snipers? Or attack dogs … or … but before I could finish that thought, I heard crunching gravel and squealing tires, and turned around to see an Overnight Express truck roaring toward us. Gee, what\u0027s the package emergency? I wondered. But when the driver\u0027s-side door flew open and Mr. Solomon jumped out and yelled, \"Get in!\" I realized we were the package. Instantly, my mind flashed back to one of Liz\u0027s note cards. COVERT OPERATION RULE #1: DON\u0027T HESITATE. Mr. Mosckowitz opened the cargo doors and I climbed inside, imagining that the truck was like our teachers—it had led a fascinating and dangerous life before it retired and came to us. But I didn\u0027t see a wall of monitors and headsets—none of the stuff the trucks have in movies—only crates and crates of packages. That\u0027s when the truck became even cooler, because I\u0027m pretty sure Mr. Solomon had stolen it! \"First rule,\" he warned as we settled inside, \"don\u0027t touch any of the packages.\" Then Mr. Solomon crawled in behind us, leaving Mr. Mosckowitz outside looking up at him like a water boy who\u0027d just been asked to hold the star quarterback\u0027s helmet. \"Harvey?\" Mr. Solomon said impatiently but still soft enough that he sounded like a pretty nice guy, \"clock\u0027s ticking.\" He tossed Mr. Moskowitz the keys. \"Oh!\" This seemed to wake him up. \"Yep. Sure thing. I\u0027ll see you\"—he pointed toward all of us—\"out there.\" \"No, you won\u0027t, Harvey,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"That\u0027s the idea.\" Call me crazy, but this wasn\u0027t how I\u0027d always pictured the first time I\u0027d be in the dark with a guy who looks like Joe Solomon. (And I\u0027m pretty sure I speak for the entire sophomore class on that one.) \"Operatives in deep cover will be given false histories,\" he fired at us through the dark. \"These histories, including names, dates of birth, and favorite kindergarten teachers, and are called …\" \"Legends!\" Liz blurted. A test is a test, in Liz\u0027s mind, and as long as there was a Q\u0026A, she could handle this mission business. \"Very good, Ms. Sutton,\" he said, and even in the dark I knew Liz was a number two lead pencil away from heaven. \"For this mission, ladies, you will be posing as normal teenage girls. Think you can handle that?\" I\u0027m not sure, but I think that might have been Joe Solomon\u0027s idea of a joke—but it was soooo not funny because, if there\u0027s one thing we\u0027re not, it\u0027s normal. But he obviously didn\u0027t care about any of that, because he just plowed on. \"When conducting manual surveillance on a subject in a three-man rotation, the person with visual contact is the …\" \"Eyeball!\" \"Correct. The person within sight of the eyeball is the…\" \"Backup.\" \"And the final person …\" \"The reserve.\" \"Very good. Now remember, rotate frequently, but not too frequently. Vary your pace and spacing, and above all…\" I felt the truck come to a stop. The engine turned off. Above all, what? I wanted to cry. The most important night of my life, and he forgets the punch line! A small light came on in the ceiling of the truck, bathing us in an eerie, orange-yellow glow, and I heard music, the kind a merry-go-round makes, and I wondered if my whole life from that point on would be a house of mirrors. Mr. Solomon moved a television monitor to one of the shelves and fiddled with some wires. I was expecting a view of the world outside (or at least something from the WB), but instead I saw what I\u0027d been seeing for years—the fourteen faces of the sophomore class. \"In the field, ladies, you can never expect to have things go as planned. I fully expect you to master the ability to improvise. For example, tonight\u0027s mission requires a vehicle not owned by the Gallagher Academy. So\"—he motioned around us—\"I made alternative arrangements.\" (Yep. He definitely stole it!) He passed earpieces to Bex, Liz, and me, and said, \"Basic comms units. Don\u0027t be afraid to use them.\" Then he showed us a pair of tortoiseshell eyeglasses, an I [HEART] Roseville button, and a necklace with a silver cross. \"There are cameras contained within these three items, which will allow us to follow and critique your progress.\" The cross swung from his forefinger and, on the screen, the image of my classmates swayed back and forth. \"These are for our benefit tonight— not yours. It\u0027s a just teaching exercise, ladies, but don\u0027t expect us to come to your rescue.\" Okay, I\u0027ll admit it. I was starting to get a little freaked out at that point, but seriously, who can blame me? We were all feeling it—I could tell by the way Bex\u0027s leg twitched and Liz kept wringing her hands. Every girl in the back of that truck was on edge (and not just because we were up close and personal with Mr. Solomon, either). Even though Liz, Bex, and I were the only ones going outside, we were all more than Gallagher Girls right then—we were operatives on a mission, and we knew there would come a day when way more than grades would be riding on what we were about to learn. The carnival music suddenly got louder as the back door opened, and the first thing I saw was a bright orange cap as Mr. Mosckowitz peeked in. \"They\u0027re close,\" he said. Mr. Solomon plugged a wire into a speaker, and in the next second I heard my mother\u0027s voice joining the carnival music. \"It\u0027s great weather for running.\" My blood went cold. Anyone but Mom, I prayed. Anyone but Mom. You know the phrase Be careful what you wish for! Oh yeah, I\u0027m now a really big believer in that one, because no sooner had the words crossed my mind than Mr. Solomon turned to us and said, \"There are three types of subjects who will always be the most difficult to surveil.\" He ticked them off on his fingers. \"People who are trained. People who suspect they may be followed. And people you know.\" He paused. \"Ladies, this is your lucky night.\" He pulled a black-and-white photo from the pocket of his jacket and held it up. The face was new to us, but the voice that came blaring through the speaker saying, \"Yes. I should probably get back into that habit myself,\" was one we knew well. \"Oh, bollocks!\" Bex exclaimed, and Liz dropped her note cards. \"Smith!\" I cried. \"You expect us to recon Professor Smith?\" I couldn\u0027t believe it! Not only was it our first mission ever, but he honestly expected us to tail a man who had thirty years of experience, and who had seen us every school day since seventh grade, and who, worst of all, was the single most paranoid human being on the planet! (Seriously. I mean, he\u0027s got the plastic surgery bills to prove it.) A team of CIA all-stars would probably get made within twenty minutes. Three Gallagher Girls didn\u0027t stand a chance. After all, once a guy\u0027s heard you give a report on the trade routes of Northern Africa, he\u0027s probably gonna wonder why you\u0027re sitting behind him on the merry-go-round! \"But… but… but… he never leaves the grounds,\" I protested, finally finding my words. \"He would never enter an unsecured area on a whim.\" Oooh, good one, I thought, as I struggled to recall Liz\u0027s flash cards. \"This goes against the subject\u0027s pattern of behavior!\" But Mr. Solomon only smiled. He knew it was an impossible mission—that was why he\u0027d given it to us. \"Trust me, ladies,\" he said with somber respect, \"no one knows Mr. Smith\u0027s patterns of behavior.\" He tossed a thick file folder toward us. \"The one thing we do know is that tonight is the Roseville town carnival, and Mr. Smith, for good or bad, is a man who loves his funnel cakes.\" \"Well, have fun!\" My mother\u0027s voice came blaring through the speakers. I imagined her waving at her colleague as he turned at the edge of town. I heard her breathing become deeper, almost felt her cross trainers as they struck the dark pavement. \"Your mission,\" Mr. Solomon said, \"is to find out what he drinks with those funnel cakes.\" I\u0027d been waiting my whole life for my first mission and it all came down to what? Carbonated beverages?! \"Subject\u0027s at the firehouse, Wise Guy,\" Mom whispered. \"He\u0027s all yours.\" And then, just like that, my mother and her watchful eyes were gone, leaving us alone in the dark with Joe \"Wise Guy\" Solomon and a mathematician in a bright orange cap. Mr. Solomon thrust the necklace toward me and said, \"In or out?\" I grabbed the cross, knowing I would need it. Chapter Six I love Bex and Liz. Seriously, I do. But when your mission is to go unnoticed at the Roseville town carnival while trailing an operative who\u0027s as good as Mr. Smith, a genius in Jackie O shades and a girl who could totally be Miss America (even though she\u0027s British) are not exactly what I\u0027d call ideal backup. \"I have eyeball,\" Bex said, as I lurked across the town square by the dunking booth. Every minute or so, I\u0027d hear a splash and applause behind me. People kept walking by carrying corn dogs and caramel apples—lots of calories on sticks—and I suddenly remembered that while our chef makes an awesome crème brûlée, his corn dogs really do leave something to be desired. So I bought one—a corn dog, that is. Now, here\u0027s where you might start thinking—Hey, who is she to eat during a mission? Or, isn\u0027t it careless to stand there smearing mustard all over a deep-fried weenie when there are operatives to tail? But that\u0027s the thing about being a pavement artist (a term first used to describe me when I was nine and successfully tailed my father through the mall to find out what he was going to buy me for Christmas), you can\u0027t be ducking behind Dumpsters and dodging into doorways all the time. Seriously, how covert is that? Real pavement artists don\u0027t hide—they blend. So when you start craving a corn dog because every third person you see is eating one, then bring on the mustard! (Besides, even spies have to eat.)","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-8.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class.
