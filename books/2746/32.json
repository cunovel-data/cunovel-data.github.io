They…they didn\u0027t know anything about…They were cool with it.\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"We don\u0027t exactly show up on caller ID.\"\n It wasn\u0027t supposed to be funny, but \"Old Josh\" would have laughed or smiled that slow, melting smile. \"New Josh\" just stood there—looking at me.\n \"Cammie.\" My mother\u0027s voice carried clearly through the doorway and echoed through the Hall of History. \"Come in here, please.\"\n I stepped inside, brushing against him for a moment that didn\u0027t last nearly long enough.\n \"I\u0027ll…\" He motioned to the benches at the top of the stairs. \"Your mom and that guy—they said I could wait.\"\n But I didn\u0027t want him to wait. If he did, I\u0027d have to look him in the eye; I\u0027d have to say things that only make sense in a language even I don\u0027t know. I wanted him to walk away and not look back. But before I could say so, Mom said, \"Cameron, now!\" and I knew we were out of time. In so many ways.\n She didn\u0027t hug and kiss me—which was strange. Not unexpected, but it gave seeing her an unfinished feeling, like I should stay standing by the door, waiting for her \"How\u0027s it going, kiddo?\" before I took a seat on the sofa and asked what was for supper. I glanced around and saw Mr. Solomon in the corner of the room. \"Sleep well?\" he asked.\n \"Not really.\" Not a lie.\n \"I enjoyed visiting with Josh,\" my mom said. \"He seems nice.\" He is. \"It was nice to meet him finally.\"\n \"Yeah, I …\" Then I realized something was wrong. \"Wait!\"\n Mom smiled at Mr. Solomon and—can you believe it— he actually smiled back. With teeth and everything! (Okay, so I might have thought he was kind of hot then. But only for a second or two.)\n \"Honey, you\u0027re good,\" Mom said to my look of utter disbelief. \"But give us some credit.\"\n Oh my gosh! I sank onto the leather sofa. \"How …\" There were so many ways to finish that sentence: how long had they known? How far were they willing to let me go? How did they find out?\n \"You\u0027ve been very busy,\" Mom said. She sat down in one of the beautiful leather chairs across from me and crossed one perfect leg over the other.\n \"You mean you didn\u0027t wonder how we found you last night?\" Mr. Solomon asked.\n No, I hadn\u0027t wondered. Everything had happened so fast, and hours later I was still riding that same wave of emotion. I felt like an idiot—a great, big, hand-caught-in-the-cookie-jar fool.\n \"Cammie, this is not an ordinary school—it can\u0027t be, with such exceptional students. What you did was reckless and careless, and if you tried a stunt like that in the field, lives would be put at risk and operations could fail. You know that. Don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"That being said, as someone with a good deal of experience\"—she glanced at Mr. Solomon, who nodded—\"it was a rather impressive display.\"\n \"It was?\" I looked between the two of them, expecting a trapdoor to open up and send me zooming to the dungeon. \"I\u0027m not… in trouble?\"\n Mom tilted her head, weighing her words. \"Let\u0027s just say, you\u0027ve had one of the more extensive Covert Operations exercises this school has ever allowed.\"\n \"Oh,\" I said, and the word sounded heavy.\n \"But, Cam,\" Mom said, leaning forward, \"why didn\u0027t you come to me?\"\n She sounded hurt. It was torture—the hard kind.\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Don\u0027t cry. Don\u0027t cry. Don\u0027t cry. \"I just…\" It was too late; my voice was cracking. \"I didn\u0027t want you to be ashamed of me.\"\n \"Her ashamed?\" Mr. Solomon said, and it took me a split second to remember that he was even in the room. \"You think she could have gotten away with as much as you did at your age?\" He laughed, then smiled. \"That wasn\u0027t your mom in you—that was your dad.\"\n He stood and strolled to the window. I saw his reflection in the sunny glass as he spoke. \"He always said you were going to be good.\" Okay, so maybe he was still a little hot…\"Cammie, I think I\u0027ve been pretty hard on you this semester,\" Joe Solomon said, as if letting me in on a secret. \"You know why?\"\n Because you hate me was the answer that sprang to mind, though I knew it wasn\u0027t the right one.\n \"I\u0027ve already lost one member of the Morgan family I care about.\" He looked between me and my mom. \"So I\u0027d give about anything for you to never come into my classroom again.\" Shocked and hurt, I could do nothing but stare at him. He reached into his pocket and pulled out my form where I\u0027d marked the Covert Operations box. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to find a nice safe desk or lab somewhere?\" I didn\u0027t answer, so after a moment he refolded the form and put it back in his pocket. \"Well, if you\u0027re going to be in the field—you\u0027re going to be ready. I owe your old man that much.\" Sadness seeped into his voice, and for the first time I saw Joe Solomon as human. \"I owe him more than that.\"\n I glanced toward my mother, who gave him a sad, knowing smile.\n \"Have a good break, Cammie,\" Mr. Solomon said, sounding like his old self as he reached for the door. \"Rest up. Next semester won\u0027t be the cakewalk you just had.\"\n That was a cakewalk?! I wanted to scream, but Joe Solomon was already gone. I wanted answers from him. How well had he known my dad? Why did he come to the Gallagher Academy now? Why did I get the feeling there was more to the story?\n But then my mom spoke, and I realized we were alone. My defenses fell, and I felt like I could curl up beside her and sleep straight through Christmas.\n \"Cammie,\" she said, moving to sit beside me. \"I\u0027m not glad you lied to me. I\u0027m not glad you broke the rules, but there is one part of this that has made me very proud.\"\n \"The computer stuff?\" I guessed. \"Because, really, that was all Liz. I didn\u0027t—\"\n \"No, kiddo. That\u0027s not it.\" She reached down and took my hand. \"Do you know that your dad and I weren\u0027t sure we wanted you to go to school here?\"\n I\u0027ve heard a lot of crazy things in my life, but that one took my breath away. \"But… you were a Gallagher Girl…. I\u0027m a legacy…. It\u0027s …\"\n \"Sweetheart,\" Mom stopped me. \"When we came here, I knew I\u0027d be taking away everything that isn\u0027t inside these walls. I didn\u0027t want this to be the only life you know.\" She smoothed my hair. \"Your dad and I used to talk about whether this was the best place for you.\"\n \"But what… how did you decide?\" I asked, but as soon as I had said the words, I knew it was a stupid question.\n \"Yeah, kiddo, when we lost your father I knew I had to get out of the field…\"\n \"And you needed a job?\" I tried to finish for her.\n She shook me off. \"I needed to come home.\"\n When did I start crying? I really didn\u0027t know. I really didn\u0027t care.\n She smoothed my hair and said, \"But the thing I worried most about was that you\u0027d spend your childhood learning to be hard and strong and never learn that it\u0027s okay to be soft and sweet.\" She straightened beside me, forced me to look into her eyes. \"Doing what we do, it doesn\u0027t mean turning off the part of yourself that loves, Cam. I loved your father…I love your father. And you. If I thought you would have to give that up … to never know that… I would take you as far away from this place as we could go.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. Not a lie.\n \"Good. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re smart enough to know that,\" she said, then pushed me away. \"Now go on. You\u0027ve got tests to take.\"\n I ran my hands across my face, searching for stray tears, then I stood and headed toward the door. But before I could leave, she stopped me.\n \"It would have been okay, you know, kiddo? To mark that other box.\"\n I looked back at her, and I saw not the headmistress or the spy or even the mother, but the woman I\u0027d seen crying.\n And just when I thought I couldn\u0027t love her more.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t touch that if I were you.\"\n Josh spun around at the sound of my words. Still, his fingers were perilously close to Gilly\u0027s sword. \"We\u0027re pretty good at keeping things protected around here,\" I said, inching closer.\n He put his hands in his pockets. That was probably the safest place for them, but the gesture reminded me of the first night we\u0027d met. I longed for that dark street, for the chance to do things over.\n \"So,\" he said. \"A spy, huh?\" His eyes never left the sword. I couldn\u0027t blame him. I didn\u0027t want to look at me, either.\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"That explains a lot.\"\n \"So they told you?\" I asked.\n He nodded. \"Yeah, I got the grand tour.\"\n Somehow, I found that really hard to believe, but I wasn\u0027t exactly in a position to say, Did you see the nuclear powered hovercraft we keep in the basement, so I just nodded, too.\n \"Josh, you know you can\u0027t ever—\"\n \"Tell anyone?\" He looked at me. \"Yeah, they told me.\"\n \"I mean, ever, Josh. Ever.\"\n \"I know,\" he said. \"I can keep a secret.\"\n The words stung. They were supposed to.\n There we were, in a room dedicated to secret lives and secret triumphs. He could see it all from where he stood. My sisterhood was bare to him. I was exposed, but there was more between us than ever before.\n \"I\u0027m sorry I lied. I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m not… normal.\"\n \"No, Cammie, I get the spy thing,\" he said, spinning on me. \"But you didn\u0027t just lie about where you go to school.\" His voice was harsh, but wounded. His eyes seemed almost bruised. \"I don\u0027t even know who you are.\"\n \"Yes, you do,\" I said. \"You know everything that matters.\"\n \"Your dad?\" he asked.\n I froze. \"It\u0027s classified—what happened—I couldn\u0027t tell you. I wanted to, but—\"\n \"Then just tell me he died. Tell me your mom can\u0027t cook and you\u0027re an only child. Don\u0027t…make up a family. Don\u0027t make up another life.\" Josh looked over the railing along the Hall of History, into the towering foyer of the Gallagher Mansion, and said, \"What\u0027s so great about normal?\"\n I might have been the genius, but Josh was the one to see the truth. For a while there, I had needed another life, a trial life—normal on a temporary basis. The problem was looking into the wounded eyes of someone I cared about and telling him that I would never be free to really love him, because … well… then I\u0027d have to kill him.\n Then, I realized where we were—what he was looking at. JOSH KNOWS! I mentally screamed. There doesn\u0027t have to be any more lying. He\u0027s inside. He\u0027s one of us (kind of). He\u0027s…\n But Josh was heading down the stairs. I bolted forward, yelling, \"Wait, Josh. Wait! It\u0027s okay now. It\u0027s…\"\n When he reached the floor, he stopped and pulled his hand out of his pocket. \"Do you want these?\" I saw the earrings lying in his palm.\n \"Yes,\" I said, nodding, biting back tears. I flew down the stairs, and he shuffled them into my hands so quickly I never even felt his touch. \"I love them. I didn\u0027t want to—\"\n \"Sure.\" He walked farther away from me. I probably know a dozen different ways to subdue a guy Josh\u0027s size—not that I would have used any of them. (Okay, so I thought about it…) \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-32.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: \n I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class.
