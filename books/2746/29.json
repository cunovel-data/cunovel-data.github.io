{"id":83012,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"JOSH: Cammie, is it true you attend the Gallagher Academy, home of filthy rotten heiresses, and are not homeschooled, as you initially told me?\\n\\n CAMMIE: (instantly bursts into tears—note: tears are very important!) Yes. It\u0027s true. I do go to the Gallagher Academy, but no one there understands me. It\u0027s not a school; (dramatic pause) it\u0027s a prison. I\u0027ll understand if you never want to see me again.\\n\\n JOSH: How could I ever hate you, Cammie? I love you. And, if possible, now I love you even more.\\n\\n C. Elimination: Dillon, aka D\u0027Man, could be \"taken out.\" (This alternative failed to achieve universal support.)\\n\\n These were all pretty good options (well, not C, but I felt as if I owed it to Bex to at least include it), but as I weighed them in my mind, and nine o\u0027clock drew closer, I knew there was another option. One we hadn\u0027t put on paper.\\n\\n Josh and Dillon were coming to get proof, and even though the rumor that the security division had recently invested in poisonous darts probably wasn\u0027t true, I still didn\u0027t want to think about what would happen if Josh came looking for me—now or ever. And when I thought about it that way, I really only had one choice.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be back soon,\" I said as I shoved Josh\u0027s earrings in my pocket and reached for my silver cross, clinging to my legend till the end.\\n\\n I walked toward the door as Bex called, \"What are you gonna tell him?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t stop as I said, \"The truth.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-six\\n\\n Well. obviously I didn\u0027t mean \"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\" truth. More like Code Red truth—the abridged kind. Spy truth.\\n\\n Yes, I go to the Gallagher Academy.\\n\\n Yes, I have been lying to you.\\n\\n Yes, you can\u0027t believe a single thing I\u0027ve said or done.\\n\\n But here\u0027s the thing about spy truth: sometimes it isn\u0027t enough to achieve your mission objectives. Sometimes you need more, and even though I didn\u0027t want to do it, maybe it\u0027s only fitting that a relationship that started with a lie would end with one.\\n\\n No, I never really loved you.\\n\\n No, I don\u0027t care that you\u0027re hurt.\\n\\n No, I never want to see you again.\\n\\n The mansion seemed especially silent and empty for so early on a Monday night. My footsteps echoed in the dim halls, but I didn\u0027t fear the noise. The tunnels were awaiting me, and Josh, and the end of something I had cherished.\\n\\n Still, before I climbed the wall one last time, there was something I couldn\u0027t stand to carry over it.\\n\\n Mr. Solomon\u0027s office wasn\u0027t exactly on my way—but it was close enough. I reached into the back pocket of my jeans for the folded form that Mr. Solomon had given us—that everyone but me had long since turned in. It was creased and mangled, and I realized that I\u0027d carried it with me almost everywhere I\u0027d gone for weeks—unsigned, unfinished.\\n\\n Twenty-four hours before, I had been afraid to even look at it, but so much can happen in a spy\u0027s life in that amount of time—a father can get reborn, a friendship can live and die, a true love can dissolve like the paper its love notes are written on. Twenty-four hours before, I had been sitting on top of our walls, but now I knew on which side I belonged.\\n\\n The two boxes lay at the bottom of the page, like a fork in the road that I had grown tired of straddling. Beyond our walls was a boy I could only hurt, and inside them were people I could help. It was probably the hardest decision of my life, and I made it by drawing an X. That\u0027s one of the golden rules of CoveOps: don\u0027t make anything more difficult than it has to be.\\n\\n It was true; things were hard enough already.\\n\\n \"Hi, Josh. Hello, Dillon, so nice seeing you again,\" I practiced as I paced the shadows of the sidewalk—waiting, not really thinking about what I had to do, but instead trying to figure out a way to accidentally-on-purpose kick Dillon in the head—hard.\\n\\n Beep. Beep beep. Beepbeepbeep.\\n\\n I glanced down at my watch and saw the red dot on the screen moving closer to my position as the tracker became a constant Beep-beep-beep-beep-beeeeeeeeeeeep.\\n\\n I temporarily deactivated it just as I heard Dillon\u0027s echoing, \"I\u0027m telling you, this is gonna be off the—\"\\n\\n \"Hi, guys.\" Okay, so my chameleon-ness wasn\u0027t entirely gone, because it was pretty obvious they hadn\u0027t had a clue I was there. Dillon even dropped his rope. (By the way, what kind of wuss needs a rope to climb a twelve-foot stone wall? I\u0027d totally been doing that since second grade!)\\n\\n But the fact that I\u0027d caught him off guard didn\u0027t stop Dillon from being super cocky (once he\u0027d managed to round up his rope and all). \"Well, well, well.\" He strolled toward me. \"There she is. How was school today?\" he asked, as if he was going to be really clever and trip me up.\\n\\n \"Fine.\" I swallowed. I didn\u0027t want to look at Josh. If I did, I feared my nerve would crumble. More than anything, I wanted Dillon to pick a fight. I could yell at Dillon; I could scream; I could earn my Gallagher glare from him. Josh was another story.\\n\\n \"We were just coming to see you,\" Dillon said, inching closer.\\n\\n \"Really?\" I said, adding an artificial nervousness to my voice. \"But …\" I glanced between the two of them. \"You don\u0027t know where I live.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure we do,\" Dillon said. \"I saw you Saturday. Walking back to school. With your friends.\"\\n\\n \"But… I\u0027m homeschooled.\" And the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Teenage Drama goes to—Cammie Morgan! \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n The streetlight above us flickered off and on, and in that half second of darkness, Dillon stepped closer.\\n\\n \"Give it up, rich girl. I SAW you!\"\\n\\n Behind him, Josh whispered, \"Dillon …\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you don\u0027t own this town, you know. I don\u0027t care what your daddy—\"\\n\\n \"Dillon,\" Josh said again, growing louder.\\n\\n Now I couldn\u0027t help looking at Josh. I couldn\u0027t stop looking at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I whispered. It was the admission of guilt Dillon had been waiting for. He just didn\u0027t know it was for the wrong crime. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m so …\"\\n\\n \"Cammie?\" Josh asked, as if trying to recognize me. \"Cammie, is it—\"\\n\\n I nodded, unable to meet his gaze through my tear-blurred vision.\\n\\n \"See!\" Dillon said, mocking me. \"I told you—\"\\n\\n \"Dillon!\" Josh cut him off. \"Just… get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"But—\" Dillon started, and Josh stepped in front of me. He was trying to shield me from Dillon, but really he\u0027d just taken away the best chance I\u0027d ever have to claw the little jerk\u0027s eyes out. (Literally, eye-clawing was going to be on the P\u0026E final.)\\n\\n \"Dillon, just go,\" Josh said, forcing his friend to back away. But that didn\u0027t stop D\u0027Man from smugly saying, \"See you around.\"\\n\\n I wanted to punch and kick and make him feel as much pain as possible, but I remembered that no amount of P\u0026E training would help me make him hurt the way that I hurt. Even at the Gallagher Academy they don\u0027t teach you how to break somebody\u0027s heart.\\n\\n As Dillon walked away, I thought of the lies I had planned to tell Josh, and for a second I thought I couldn\u0027t do it. I couldn\u0027t hurt him—then or ever. But just as soon as Dillon disappeared, Josh spun and shouted, \"Is it true?\"\\n\\n \"Josh, I—\"\\n\\n He stepped closer. His voice was harder. \"You\u0027re one of them?\"\\n\\n One of them?\\n\\n \"Josh—\"\\n\\n \"A Gallagher Girl.\" All my life, that term had been revered, almost worshipped, but on Josh\u0027s lips it was an insult, and in that instant he stopped being the boy of my dreams and started being one of Dillon\u0027s hoodlums at the pharmacy; he was ganging up on Anna; he was judging me, so I snapped, \"So what if I am?\"\\n\\n \"Humph!\" Josh said then shook his head, staring into the dark night. \"I should have known it.\" He kicked at the ground like I\u0027d seen him do a thousand times, and when he spoke, it was almost to himself. \"Homeschooled.\" Then he looked at me. \"So what was I? Some kind of joke? Was it like, hey, who can make a fool out of a townie? Was that—\"\\n\\n \"Josh—\"\\n\\n \"No, I really want to know. Was it charity case week? Or date your local delivery boy month? Or—\"\\n\\n \"Josh!\"\\n\\n \"Or were you just bored?\"\\n\\n \"YES!\" I yelled at last, wanting it to stop. \"Yes, okay. I was bored, and I wanted to see if I could get away with it, okay?\"\\n\\n Mr. Solomon was right—the worst kind of torture is watching someone you love get hurt.\\n\\n Josh backed down, and his voice was almost a whisper as he said, \"Okay.\" We\u0027d both gone too far—said too much— but we both knew then that there are reasons Gallagher Girls don\u0027t date boys from Roseville. He just didn\u0027t know that the reasons are classified.\\n\\n \"Look, I\u0027m leaving tomorrow,\" I said, knowing that I couldn\u0027t have Josh climbing the fence that night or any other. \"I had to say good-bye.\" I reached into my pocket for the earrings. They glistened in my hand like fallen stars. \"You should probably take these back.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said, waving them away. \"They\u0027re yours.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I forced them into his hand. \"You take them. Give them to DeeDee.\" He looked shocked. \"I think she\u0027d really like them.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, okay.\" He shoved the earrings into his pocket as I forced a smile.\\n\\n \"Hey, take care, okay?\" I took a step, then remembered how he\u0027d felt chained to one kind of life while I felt bound to another. \"And you know free will?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" he said, sounding surprised that I\u0027d remembered.\\n\\n \"Good luck with that.\"\\n\\n Free will. I used mine to walk away—back to the life I\u0027d been bound to, the life I\u0027d chosen—and away from the boy who had shown me exactly what I was giving up. I hoped he wasn\u0027t watching me go. In my mind, he had already turned a corner—hating me a little, allowing that to bridge the gap over his grief. I walked on through the darkness, but I didn\u0027t look back.\\n\\n If I had, I probably would have seen the van.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-seven\\n\\n Tires squealed across the pavement. I smelled burning rubber and heard shouting and the sound of metal against metal—a door, I think. Hands were around my eyes, covering my mouth, just like on another night, on another street, when another set of hands came from out of nowhere. Autopilot kicked on, and seconds later my attacker lay at my feet—but it wasn\u0027t Josh—not that time.\\n\\n Another set of hands were on me. Fists were everywhere. I kicked—made contact—heard a familiar, \"Oh, jeez that hurt.\"\\n\\n But before I could process what I had heard, I was on my stomach in the van, and someone was commanding, \"Drive!\"\\n\\n I lay there, motionless, really ticked off, because, even though Mr. Solomon had been hinting for weeks that our CoveOps semester final was going to be a practical exam, I hadn\u0027t realized how literally he\u0027d meant it until Mr. Smith blindfolded me and bound my hands.\\n\\n \"Sorry, Mr. Mosckowitz,\" I muttered, feeling guilty about kicking him so hard. After all, it was only the second mission he\u0027d ever been on, and I kicked him in the gut. Plus, I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s a bruiser.\\n\\n He wheezed a little before saying, \"That\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll be … fine.\"\\n\\n \"Harvey …\" Mr. Solomon warned.\\n\\n \"Right. Be quiet,\" Mr. Mosckowitz said, jabbing me softly in the ribs, sounding like he was having the time of his life. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-29.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \\n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class.
