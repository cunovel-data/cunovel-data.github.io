{"id":82990,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"As we walked between Madame Dabney\u0027s tea room and the elevator to Sublevel One, Tina Walters told me for about the tenth time, \"Cammie, you don\u0027t even have to steal the file…Just take a little—\"\\n\\n \"Tina!\" I snapped, then whispered because a crowded hallway full of future spies isn\u0027t the best place to have a covert conversation, \"I\u0027m not going to steal Macey\u0027s permanent record just to see if she really set the gym on fire at her last school.\"\\n\\n \"Borrow,\" Tina reminded me. \"Borrow the permanent record. Just a peek.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I said again, just as we turned into the small, dark corridor. I saw Liz standing there, staring into the mirror that concealed the elevator as if she didn\u0027t recognize her own reflection. \"What\u0027s wrong with …\" Then I saw the little slip of yellow paper. \"What? Is it out of order or—\"\\n\\n And then I read the little slip of yellow paper.\\n\\n SOPHOMORE C.O. CLASS CANCELED.\\n\\n MEET OUTSIDE TONIGHT. 7:00,\\n\\n DON\u0027T WEAR YOUR UNIFORMS!\\n\\n -SOLOMON\\n\\n Bex\u0027s reflection appeared beside mine, and our eyes locked. I started to rip the note from the mirror, to save it as a piece of Gallagher Academy history, because two things were extraordinary about it. First, I\u0027d never even heard of a class being canceled, much less witnessed it myself. Second, Joe Solomon had just invited fourteen girls to go on what amounted to a moonlight stroll.\\n\\n Things were about to get interesting.\\n\\n I\u0027ve seen Liz freak out about assignments before, but that day at lunch, she was as white as the salt in the shaker as she went over every tiny, perfectly punctuated line of her CoveOps notes—stopping occasionally to cinch her eyes together as if she were trying to read the answers on the top of her head. (Maybe she was. With Liz\u0027s head, anything is possible.)\\n\\n \"Liz, est-ce qu-il-y-a une épreuve de CoveOps dont je ne connais pas?\" I asked, thinking that if there was a CoveOps test I didn\u0027t know about, someone should really bring me into the loop. But Liz thought I was trying to be funny.\\n\\n \"Tu ne la considéras pas sérieuse?\" she nearly yelled. \"Tu sais ques Ke qui se passe ce soir!\"\\n\\n Of course I was taking it seriously, but Liz wasn\u0027t about to believe that, so I abandoned our French assignment and whispered, \"No, Liz, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Exactement!\" she cried, leaning closer. \"Anything in these books could be out there!\" she said, as if we were dropping into an actual war zone and not our own backyard. \"Or it could be something\"—she looked around and then leaned closer—\"not in the books!\"\\n\\n I seriously thought she might throw up, especially when Bex leaned over and said, \"I bet we\u0027re going to bust up a drug cartel that\u0027s operating out of a nightclub.\" (Because she saw that once on an episode of Alias.)\\n\\n Liz gulped, and her knuckles went white as she gripped a flash card. \"It won\u0027t be anything like that, Liz,\" I whispered. But by this time the entire sophomore class was staring.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Tina demanded. \"What do you know? Did your mother tell you something?\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I said, wishing I hadn\u0027t gotten them started. \"I don\u0027t know anything.\"\\n\\n \"So Solomon didn\u0027t ask your mother for two helicopters, three stun guns, and a dozen Brazilian passports?\"\\n\\n But before I could respond to Tina\u0027s ridiculous question, the main doors opened, and the seventh-grade class came in, doing a lot of bon jouring—\"hello\" being one of the few phrases they knew—and the sophomore class forgot about me and went back to doing what it had been doing for a week—watching Macey McHenry.\\n\\n She was the first person to ever combine black fingernail polish with a Peter Pan-collared white blouse (that\u0027s not verified or anything—just a guess), and her diamond nose ring looked like a twenty-thousand-dollar zit, but to an outsider, Macey McHenry might have seemed like one of us. She walked through the Grand Hall like she owned the place (as usual), picked up a plain green salad with no dressing (as usual), and walked to our table. Then she plopped down next to Bex and said, \"The munchkins annoy,\" which was totally not usual.\\n\\n Up to that point, I\u0027d mainly heard Macey say things like \"You\u0027re in my light,\" and \"If you\u0027re gonna have plastic surgery, you might want to try my mother\u0027s guy in Palm Springs.\" (Needless to say, Mr. Smith didn\u0027t write down the number.) But there she was, sitting with us, talking with us. Acting like one of us!\\n\\n Liz said, \"Je me demande pourquoi elk a décidé a parler à nous aujourd\u0027hui. Comme c\u0027est bizarre!\" But I didn\u0027t know why Macey was feeling so talkative, either.\\n\\n Before I could respond, Macey turned to Liz and snapped, \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you either, freak.\"\\n\\n I was just starting to process the fact that even cosmetic heiresses who get kicked out of a lot of private schools speak pretty good French, when Macey leaned closer to Liz, who leaned away.\\n\\n \"Tell me,\" Macey said in the worst imitation Southern accent I\u0027ve ever heard, \"how can someone who\u0027s supposed to be so smart sound so stupid?\"\\n\\n Liz\u0027s pale face turned instantly red as tears came to the corners of her eyes. Before I knew what was happening, Bex had flown from her seat, pinned Macey\u0027s right arm behind her back with one hand, and grabbed that diamond nose ring with the other so fast that I said a quick prayer of thanks that the British are on our side (well, assuming we never revisit the Revolutionary War).\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re three years late, but let me give you a real quick, important lesson,\" Bex said in English (probably because it\u0027s harder to sound scary in French). But the strangest thing was happening—Macey was smiling—almost laughing, and Bex totally didn\u0027t know what to do.\\n\\n The rest of the hall was going slowly quiet, as if someone somewhere was turning the volume down. By the time the teachers stopped talking, Bex still had ahold of Macey, I had leaned across the table to grab ahold of Bex, and Liz had a death grip on a flash card that listed the top five places you should go to look for black market explosives in St. Petersburg.\\n\\n \"Rebecca,\" said a male voice. I turned away from the tight-lipped smirk that was spreading across Macey\u0027s face to see Joe Solomon standing behind me, speaking across the table to Bex, who was slowly allowing blood to creep back into Macey\u0027s arm. \"I understand you could get into trouble for that,\" he said.\\n\\n It\u0027s true. Gallagher Girls don\u0027t fight in the hallways. We don\u0027t slap and we don\u0027t shove. But mostly, we don\u0027t use the skills of the sisterhood against the sisters. Ever. It\u0027s a testament to how universally despised and viewed as an outsider Macey was that Bex wasn\u0027t immediately jumped from ten directions. But Mr. Solomon was an outsider, too. Maybe that\u0027s why he said, \"If you\u0027re so eager to show off, you and your friends can take point tonight.\" He looked at Liz and me. \"Good luck.\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t a cheery, break-a-leg \"good luck,\" though. It was a watch-out-or-you\u0027ll-have-your-legs-broken \"good luck.\"\\n\\n Liz went back to her flash cards, but Bex and I stared at each other across the table as our faces morphed from sheer terror to uncontrolled excitement. For Gallagher Girls, leading a mission is no punishment—that\u0027s the gold-freaking-star! Only a little of the dread lingered in the back of my mind as I realized that we were about to play with live ammo— maybe in both the literal and figurative senses of the word.\\n\\n Macey returned to her salad while Mr. Solomon added, \"Et n\u0027oubliez pas, mesdemoiselles, ce soir vous êtes des civils— ressemblez-y.\"\\n\\n Oh, yeah, just what I needed—fashion advice from Joe Solomon himself. The Grand Hall went back to normal, but I doubt that any of the sophomores, besides Macey, took another bite. As if we hadn\u0027t known it before, Joe Solomon had just reminded us that we\u0027d soon be venturing out from behind our comfortable walls, operating on our own for the first time in our superspy lives.\\n\\n Four years of training had all come down to this, and I for one didn\u0027t have a thing to wear.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure how it happened, but at some point between one P.M. and six forty-five, the sophomore class from the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women morphed from a group of spies-in-training into a bunch of teenage girls. It was pretty scary.\\n\\n Liz spent her afternoon becoming the textbook version of what an undercover operative should look like, copying everything from the patent leather purse to the pillbox hat. (It was a pretty old textbook.) Then the hallways started reverberating with terrifying yells of \"Have you seen my black boots?\" and \"Does anyone have any hair spray?\"\\n\\n I was seriously starting to worry about the fate of national security. In our suite, Bex looked awesome (as usual), Liz looked ridiculous (but try telling her that), and Macey was looking at an old Cosmo as if determining whether green is the new black was a matter of life or death. All I could do was sit on my bed in my old jeans and a black knit top my mom once wore to parachute onto the top of the Iranian Embassy, and watch the clock tick down.\\n\\n But then Tina came busting into our room. \"Which one?\" she asked, holding a pair of black leather pants and short skirt in front of her. I was on the verge of saying, neither, when Eva Alvarez ran in.\\n\\n \"Do these go? I don\u0027t know if these go!\" Eva held up a pair of high-heeled boots that made my feet hurt just by looking at them.\\n\\n \"Um, Eva, can you run in those?\" I asked.\\n\\n But before Eva could answer, I heard someone say, \"They\u0027re all the rage in Milan.\" I looked around. I counted heads. And then it dawned on me who was speaking. Macey stared at us over the top of her magazine, and added, \"If you want to know.\"\\n\\n Within minutes, half the sophomore class was in our little suite, and Macey was telling Tina, \"You know, lip liner is supposed to go on the lips,\" and Tina was actually listening! I mean, this is the same girl who had single-handedly started the Macey-is-Mr. Smith\u0027s-illegitimate-daughter rumor. Little did we know she was one fashion emergency away from turning to the enemy!\\n\\n Courtney was borrowing earrings; Anna was trying on jackets; and I wasn\u0027t sure if I would ever feel safe going into hostile territory with any of them ever again.\\n\\n \"You know, Eva, what blends in Milan might stick out in Roseville,\" I tried, but she didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n \"You know, guys, hiding in plain sight requires looking plain!\" I said, but Kim Lee was wriggling out of a halter top and nearly knocked my head off with her flailing arms.\\n\\n \"You know, I really don\u0027t think he\u0027s taking us to the prom!\" I shouted, and Anna put Macey\u0027s gorgeous formal gown back into the closet.\\n\\n I\u0027m the chameleon! I wanted to cry. I\u0027m the CoveOps legacy! I\u0027d been preparing for this night my entire life—doing drills with my dad, asking my mom to tell me stories, becoming the girl nobody sees. But now I was drifting deeper and deeper into the shadows until I was standing in the middle of my own room, watching my closest friends swarm around our gorgeous new guest, and I was completely invisible.\\n\\n \"Lose the earrings,\" Macey said, pointing to Eva. \"Tuck in the shirt,\" she told Anna, then turned to Courtney Bauer and said, \"What died in your hair?\" (Courtney does have a tendency to over-gel sometimes.)\\n\\n Bex was sitting with Liz on her bed, and they both looked as amazed as I felt. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-7.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \\n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class.
