{"id":83015,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Oh my gosh, he\u0027s leaving, I thought—not knowing whether to feel sad at his loss or thrilled with the fact that we were letting him walk out that door—his memory of our secrets intact. Surely they\u0027re not going to let that happen, I wondered, unless they trust him … unless he\u0027s been cleared … unless someone decided that he didn\u0027t need to drink the tea and go to sleep and wake up feeling like he\u0027s had a crazy dream he can\u0027t remember.\\n\\n Unless it\u0027s okay for me to love him.\\n\\n He reached for the door, so I blurted, \"Josh,\" knowing that if the Gallagher Academy was going to take a chance on him, I had to at least try to make things right. \"I… I go to Nebraska over winter break. My grandparents live there— my dad\u0027s parents. But I\u0027ll be back.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said as he reached for the door. \"I guess I\u0027ll see you around.\"\\n\\n It was fast—like blink-or-you\u0027ll-miss-it fast—but Josh smiled at me—quickly, sweetly, and that was enough to let me know that he\u0027d meant it when he said he\u0027d be seeing me. More important, it proved that he\u0027d be looking.\\n\\n I was just starting to imagine what it was going to be like—a new year, a new semester, a new start with no secrets standing between us, but then he stopped and said, \"Oh, tell your mom thanks for the tea.\"\\n\\n He opened the door and walked outside. I stood in the middle of the empty foyer for a long time. After all, in the movies, the dramatic good-bye is often followed by the good-bye-er flying back through the door to sweep the good\u0027 bye-ee into a very dramatic, very sexy kiss. And if there was any dramatic, sexy kissing potential in my future, I wasn\u0027t going to sway from that spot.\\n\\n I felt something soft and warm rub against my leg and looked down to see Onyx wrapping her tail around my ankle. She purred, consoling me, sounding like a very lucky cat, and I knew things had come full circle.\\n\\n Behind me, girls started rushing down the stairs toward the Grand Hall and a few last-minute study sessions before the first day of finals, but as they passed me, I knew what the main topic of conversation was going to be over breakfast. (You think regular girls love gossip—try Gallagher Girls!)\\n\\n Still, I didn\u0027t mind their stares. Instead, I stood swaying in the current of bodies that was floating off to start the day, but I didn\u0027t budge until Bex appeared beside me.\\n\\n \"Hey.\" She shoved a book and a bagel into my hands. \"Come on,\" she said with a tug at my arm. \"We\u0027ve got our COW final, you know. Liz made flash cards.\"\\n\\n I followed my friend up the stairs, and I got lost in a sea of girls who were dressed like me, and were trained like I was, and who were entrenched in my same world.\\n\\n Is this the world I would choose if I could go back—be ignorant and blissful and happy—if I could live a white picket life on a white picket street and be ignorant of the unpleasant deeds that have to be done in places most people can\u0027t find on a map? I don\u0027t know. Maybe I would if my mind was like an Etch A Sketch and I could shake it and erase all that I know. But I\u0027m in too deep now. I know what goes bump in the night, and I know how to fight it.\\n\\n Bex and I walked up the stairs. Then Liz joined our steps, then Macey. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen next semester. I don\u0027t know if Josh will ever talk to me again. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll remember, or what we\u0027ll face in CoveOps, or even what Mr. Smith will look like come September. But I know who will be beside me, and as every good spy knows—sometimes that\u0027s enough. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-33.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \\n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies. Even though Cammie is fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways, she has no idea what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks she\u0027s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, or track him through town with the skill of a real \"pavement artist\"-but can she maneuver a relationship with someone who can never know the truth about her? \\n Cammie Morgan may be an elite spy-in-training, but in her sophomore year, she\u0027s on her most dangerous mission-falling in love.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.jpg","author":"Ally Carter","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:18 PM"}}
