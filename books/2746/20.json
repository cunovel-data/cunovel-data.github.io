{"id":83003,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Okay, so maybe Josh was pretty smart, too.\n Chapter Sixteen\n Summary of Communication On October 18, during a routine Driver\u0027s Ed assignment, The Operatives noticed that the \"fill sign\" was marked (in other words, the stone was turned) at the designated dead letter drop, so Agent Morgan faked a stomachache when everyone else was engaged in a Gilmore Girls marathon and went to retrieve the following:\n Okay, so if your dad\u0027s not Aquaman, is he The Flash?\n Translation: Please think I\u0027m funny, because my self-esteem is fairly low, and humor may be all I have going for me. (Translation done by Macey McHenry.)\n After a brief reply from The Operative, The Subject wrote back the following week: Today my shop teacher gave me detention for not properly sanding a birdhouse. Then my dad told me I should start helping him at the pharmacy two nights a week. When I got home, I found out that my mom made 18 different kinds of banana bread, and I had to taste-test each one. It was torture. How was your day?\n Translation: I feel very comfortable sharing things with you because you are separate from my ordinary, mundane life. Leaving these notes and having clandestine meetings is exciting. Having a relationship with you is new and unique, and I\u0027m enjoying it. (Translation done by Macey McHenry, with assistance from Elizabeth Sutton.)\n The Operatives took this message as a positive sign and fully expected The Subject to continue communication. A level of trust seemed to be building, and The Operatives felt as if The Subject may soon be ready to be called on to act. The Subject was making excellent progress.\n Then they received the following:\n This is crazy. You know that right?\n Translation: While I enjoy the temporary release from normalcy this relationship provides, I can see that it is impractical in the long run. However, I am willing to see where it goes. (Translation done by Macey McHenry.)\n Following this communication, The Operatives knew that it was important to proceed slowly in order to bring The Subject along at a manageable pace. They agreed that any mention of dates, making out, and any sort of formal events should be postponed indefinitely.\n Another week passed before The Operatives received their most significant piece of communication to date:\n Is there, any chance you can come to the movies this Friday? I know you may not be able to, but I\u0027ll be here (at our place) at seven if you can.\n Translation: WE\u0027RE IN!! (Translation done by Cameron Morgan and verified by Macey McHenry.)\n We had a place! We had a date—to the movies!\n My euphoria lasted from the time I picked up the note and all the way through our customary debrief up in the suite. By the next morning, however, I wasn\u0027t thinking like a girl—I was thinking like a spy.\n What if movies were the favorite pastime of the guys in the Gallagher Maintenance Department? Or, what if the movie was gross and I got nauseous and puked Milk Duds everywhere?\n MILK DUDS! What if I got caramel in my teeth and had to go digging around in a molar or something to get it out? There is simply no attractive way of doing that! What was I going to do—only eat popcorn? But then the same thing could happen with the little kernel pieces!\n Oh my gosh! I had an Organic Chemistry test and a Conversational Swahili exam, but both of those things seemed like child\u0027s play compared to the dilemma at hand— right up until Macey joined us at our lunch table and said, \"Junior Mints.\"\n Junior Mints—of course! Minty chocolate fun with none of the dangerous side effects. I take back everything I ever said about her ever in my life. MACEY McHENRY IS A GENIUS!\n Liz was looking at the note, comparing it against the others she\u0027d already run through the lab to see if the chemical composition of the paper or the ink could tell us anything. (It did—he shops at Wal-Mart.)\n \"Notice how he tilts the M in movie,\" Liz said, holding the note toward us. \"I think I remember reading that this shows a tendency to…\"\n But a tendency to what, we\u0027d never find out, because just then the sophomore lunch tables went quiet in a way that could only mean one thing.\n \"Hello, ladies,\" Joe Solomon said, but not before I snatched the piece of paper and crammed it in my mouth, which ordinarily would have been really great spy maneuvering except that Josh doesn\u0027t use Evapopaper.\n \"How\u0027s the lasagna?\" Mr. Solomon asked, and I started to say something before I remembered that my mouth was…well… otherwise engaged.\n \"The Gallagher Academy career fair is this Friday evening,\" Mr. Solomon said. My roommates and I all looked at each other—the exact same thing crossing our minds— this Friday evening! \"Here\u0027s a list of agencies and firms that will be represented.\" He tossed a stack of flyers onto the long table. \"Great chance to see what\u0027s out there—especially for those of you who won\u0027t be joining me in Sublevel Two.\"\n Okay, I admit it. That part made me swallow a little paper.\n After Mr. Solomon left, I spat out what was left of Josh\u0027s note (which luckily included all of the writing) and stared at it and the shiny flyer, which announced a chance for me to chart the course of the rest of my life. I wasn\u0027t hungry anymore.\n Career day at spy school is probably like career days at regular schools except…well … we probably have a lot more guests who arrive by rappeling out of black helicopters. (The guys from Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms have always been kinda show-offy.)\n The hallways were full of folding tables and cheesy banners, (GO ALL THE WAY WITH THE NSA—who thinks of this stuff?) Every classroom had a scout perched at a back table, watching in amazement as we went through our routines. Even P\u0026E was crawling with spies—literally—as we spread out in the barn and showed off our overall lethal-ness for the recruiters.\n \"Don\u0027t take my head off!\" Liz cried.\n I wasn\u0027t sure if she was talking about the roundhouse kick that had just passed inches from her nose or the fact that Bex was refusing to consider postponing my big date. In any case, I was fairly certain we probably shouldn\u0027t be having that conversation in a hayloft full of current and future government agents.\n Light cascaded through the skylights. Barn swallows nested in the rafters up above. And ten feet away, Tina Walters was showing an agent from the FBI how we\u0027d learned to kill a man with a piece of uncooked spaghetti.\n \"Guys!\" I snapped.\n A whistle blew, telling us it was time to shift positions, so Bex came to stand behind me. As she wrapped her arms around my neck, she whispered in my ear, \"Crowded corridors. Tons of people. No one will miss you—not The Chameleon.\"\n I flipped her over my back and glared at her as she lay sprawled on the mat beneath me.\n \"I think you have to cancel,\" Liz said as she charged at me. I slid aside and dropped her neatly to the mat next to Bex. She pushed up on her elbows and whispered, \"This is an opportunity for the Gallagher Girls of today to decide how they will become the Gallagher Women of tomorrow.\" (Or so we\u0027d read on the flyer.)\n I was just starting to feel in control of the situation, when Bex\u0027s leg swung swiftly around, catching me off guard, dropping me to the top of the pile. \"Yeah, like Cammie doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s going to be when she grows up.\"\n Before I could reply, we saw a man walking toward us, so we scrambled to our feet. He wasn\u0027t tall or short; he wasn\u0027t handsome or ugly. He was the kind of person you could see a dozen times and never quite remember, and with just one glance I knew he was a pavement artist—I knew he was like me.\n \"Very nice,\" the man said. There was no telling how long he\u0027d been in that crowded loft, watching. \"You girls are sophomores, is that right?\"\n There was an extra bounce in Bex\u0027s step as she inched toward him. \"Yes, sir,\" she said, her voice full of swagger.\n \"And you\u0027re all studying Covert Operations?\" he asked with a sideways glance at Liz, who had somehow gotten her hair tangled in the laces of my shoe.\n \"Just for this semester,\" Liz said, sounding totally relieved.\n \"Next semester we can specialize if we want to,\" Bex clarified. \"But a lot of us continue training for fieldwork.\"\n I\u0027m pretty sure she was getting ready to slip into the conversation how she got to be lookout for her dad once while he took out an arms dealer at an outdoor market in Cairo, but the man didn\u0027t give her a chance.\n \"Well,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll let you get back to your practice.\" He placed his hands in his pockets and smiled. When he turned to walk away, I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d seen me at all, until he glanced in my direction and nodded. \"Ms. Morgan.\" If he\u0027d had a hat he would have tipped it.\n On the other side of the room, Ms. Hancock blew her whistle again and yelled, \"Circle up, girls. Let\u0027s show our guests how we play rock-paper-scissors.\"\n Bex winked at me and rolled up a copy of the October Vogue that she\u0027d borrowed from Macey.\n I felt sorry for whoever drew rock and scissors.\n Operation Divide and Conquer The operation, which took place on Friday night, October 29, was a basic four-man op with three agents holding in secure sweeping patterns throughout the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women. The Reserve Operatives were assigned a portion of the main campus, and when asked where Agent Morgan was, The Operatives were to reply \"I don\u0027t know\" or \"I just saw her heading that way\" while pointing in a very general direction.\n If asked more directly about the location of Agent Morgan, The Operatives were to exclaim, \"You just missed her!\" and then walk very quickly away.\n I followed Bex and Macey through the corridors. Sounds bounced off the hardwood floors and stone walls as newbies drooled over the Mr. Solomon-like recruiters from the CIA, and a flock of seventh graders oohed and aahed over the latest satellite feeds from Homeland Security. (So that\u0027s what Brad Pitt\u0027s bedroom looks like…)\n Bex was totally right. I\u0027ve seen the Gallagher Academy in states of organized chaos before, but never have I seen it so alive. The air was full of something (and not just the gases that had escaped from the labs when someone from Interpol got a little too close to one of Dr. Fibs\u0027s classified projects).\n \"Okay,\" Bex said to me beneath her breath. \"Knock \u0027em dead.\"\n I glanced at Macey. \"You\u0027ll be fine,\" she said, and I started to feel really good. Then she finished. \"Just don\u0027t be an idiot.\"\n I turned down an empty corridor, leaving the sounds of our future behind me, and sensed something else drawing closer. I reached out for the tapestry and the crest-slash-trigger behind it, when I stopped frozen at the sound of my name.\n \"You must be Cameron Morgan.\"\n The man strolling toward me had a dark suit, dark hair, and eyes so black they could get completely lost in the night.\n \"And where are you running off to?\" the man asked.\n \"Oh, they needed more napkins at the refreshments table.\" (Whether you agree or disagree with my actions, you\u0027ve got to admit that my fibbing ability was totally getting better.)\n He laughed. \"Oh, child, don\u0027t you know that anyone with your pedigree should never have to fetch the napkins?\" I stared blankly at him, unable to smile, until he extended his hand. \"I\u0027m Max Edwards. I knew your father.\"\n Of course he did. I\u0027d met a half dozen men like Max Edwards already that day—men with stories, men with secrets—all wanting to pull me aside and return a little piece of my father to me. Even without Josh waiting for me at the end of the tunnel, I think I might have felt like running the other way. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-20.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: \n I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies.
