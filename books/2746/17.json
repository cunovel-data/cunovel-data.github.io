{"id":83000,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I saw Bex shift. She\u0027d been doing a better than average job of ignoring us, but I knew all of her sensors were on full alert. Her eyes never left her notebook, but she saw everything. (Bex is super sleuthy that way.) \"What does it mean?\" Liz asked again, inching closer and closer to Macey McHenry, our new professor of boys. Macey looked back at her notebook, and must have come to the conclusion that she\u0027d studied enough for one night, because she tossed her notes aside. She marched to her bed, glanced at the scrap of paper once more, then dropped it to the floor. \"It means he\u0027s in demand.\" She nodded at me. \"Good choosing.\" \"But does he like her back?\" Liz wanted to know. \"This DeeDee person?\" Macey shrugged and stretched out on her bed. \"Hard to say.\" That\u0027s when Liz pulled out a notebook I\u0027d seen her carrying around for the past week. I\u0027d thought it was for an extra project—little did I know it was our extra project. She threw the binder open with a thunk, and a hundred pieces of paper ruffled with the sudden waft of air. I looked at the headers of each piece as Liz rifled through them. \"See …\" She pointed to a highlighted portion of one page. \"…in this e-mail he used the word \u0027bro\u0027 in reference to his friend Dillon. As in, and I quote, \u0027chill out, bro. It will be okay.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t have a brother. What is it about boys that makes them refer to each other in that way? I don\u0027t call Cam or Bex sis. Why?\" she demanded, as if her life depended upon her understanding this fact. \"WHY?\" Yeah, that\u0027s when Macey McHenry looked at Liz as if she were stupid. Of all the crazy things I\u0027ve seen in this business, that was one of the craziest. Macey cocked her head and said, \"You\u0027re the uber-genius?\" Just like that, Bex was up off the bed and moving toward Macey. Things were about to get bad—really bad. But poor Liz wasn\u0027t hurt by what Macey said. In fact, she just looked at her and said, \"I know—right!\" as if she too were outraged. Bex stopped. I exhaled. And eventually Liz shook her head in amazement, scattering the unanswered questions from her mind—something I must have seen her do a thousand times. That\u0027s when I knew that boys were just another subject to Liz—another code she had to crack. Eventually, she dropped to the floor and said, \"I\u0027ve got to make a chart.\" \"Look.\" Macey seemed to give up as she straightened herself on the bed. \"If he\u0027s the sentimental type, then it means he doesn\u0027t care about her. If he\u0027s not, then he might like her—or might not.\" She leaned closer, needing us to understand. \"You can analyze or theorize—or whatever—but seriously, what good do you think it will do? You\u0027re in here. He\u0027s out there. And there\u0027s nothing I can do about that.\" \"Oh,\" Bex said, speaking for the first time. \"That\u0027s not your area of expertise anyway.\" I saw her mind churning. She looked like a girl on a mission as she stepped forward. \"It\u0027s ours.\" Chapter Thirteen Spies are wise. Spies are strong. But, most of all, spies are patient. We waited two weeks. TWO WEEKS! Do you know how long that is in fifteen-year-old-girl time? A lot. A LOT, a lot. I was really starting to empathize with all those women who talk about biological clocks. I mean, I know mine\u0027s still got a lot of ticks left in it, but I still managed to think and worry about Operation Josh every spare minute—and that was at genius spy school, where spare minutes aren\u0027t exactly common. I can only imagine the misery of a girl going to a normal school, since she probably isn\u0027t going to spend her Saturday nights helping her best friend crack the codes that protect U.S. spy satellites. (Liz even split the extra credit she earned from Mr. Mosckowitz with me—the cash prize offered by the NSA, she kept.) We were in the classic holding pattern, gathering info, building his profile and my legend, biding our time until we had what we needed to go in. Two weeks of this. TWO WEEKS! (Just in case you missed it before.) Then, as with all good covert operatives, we caught a break. Tuesday, October 1. Subject received an e-mail from Dillon, screen name \"D\u0027Man,\" asking if The Subject would like a ride home from play practice. The Subject responded by saying that he would be walking home—that he needs to return some videos at \"AJ\u0027s\" (local establishment located on town square that specializes in movie and video game rentals). I looked at the e-mail as Bex slid it onto the breakfast table in front of me. \"Tonight,\" she whispered. \"We\u0027re on.\" During CoveOps class I honestly couldn\u0027t write fast enough. Joe Solomon is a genius, I thought, wondering why I\u0027d never realized it before. \"Learn your legends early. Learn them well,\" he warned as he leaned over, gripping the back of the teacher\u0027s chair I\u0027d never seen him sit in. \"The split second it takes you to recall something your cover identity would know is the split second in which very bad people can do very bad things.\" My hand was shaking. Pencil marks were going everywhere on the page—kind of like the time I picked up a pencil to use in Dr. Fibs\u0027s class, only it turned out it wasn\u0027t an ordinary pencil, but rather a prototype for a new Morse code auto-translator. (Needless to say, I still haven\u0027t fully recovered from the guilt of sharpening it.) \"Most of all, remember that going into deep cover does not mean approaching subjects.\" Mr. Solomon eyed us. \"It means putting yourself in a position where the subject approaches you.\" I don\u0027t know about regular girls, but when you\u0027re a spy, getting dressed to go out can be something of a production. (Can I just say thank goodness for Velcro—seriously—no wonder the Gallagher Academy invented the stuff.) \"I still think we should have put her hair up,\" Liz said. \"It looks glamorous.\" \"Yeah,\" Macey scoffed, \"because so many girls go for glamour when they hang out at the Roseville town square.\" She had a point. Personally, I didn\u0027t care, which was kind of ironic since it was my hair and all, but I had plenty of other things on my mind—not the least of which was the arsenal of items that Bex was spreading out on the bed in front of me—not that I could really see all that well, because Macey was doing my makeup and she kept telling me to \"look up\" or \"look down\" or \"hold perfectly still.\" When she wasn\u0027t barking demands, she was saying things like, \"Talk, but not too much. Laugh, but not too loud.\" And, my personal favorite, \"If he\u0027s shorter than you, slouch.\" Then Bex took over. \"Let\u0027s talk pocket litter.\" (Not a sentence you hear every day unless you\u0027re…well… us.) \"You\u0027re not sixteen, so IDs aren\u0027t a problem, but we still have to support your cover identity.\" She turned and began scanning the items on the bed. \"Take this,\" she said, tossing a pack of gum in my direction. It was the same brand we\u0027d pulled from Josh\u0027s garbage. \"To display common likes and help with the whole breath thing.\" Bex scanned the bed again. \"What did we say, handbag or no handbag?\" she asked, turning back to the group. \"She should definitely carry a purse,\" Macey said, and Bex agreed. I couldn\u0027t believe it! Macey and Bex were bonding…over accessories! Would wonders never cease? Bex pulled a bag off the bed and opened it. \"Movie ticket stub—if he asks you how you liked it, just say you did, but you didn\u0027t buy the ending.\" She dropped the tiny scrap of paper into the bag and picked up another item. \"Binocuglasses. You shouldn\u0027t need them tonight, of course, but it won\u0027t hurt to have them.\" She dropped yet another item inside our pack of lies then topped everything off with a What Would Jesus Do? ink pen, then snapped the bag shut with a very self-satisfied smirk. I had no idea how Bex had found all that stuff, and to tell you the truth, I didn\u0027t want to know. But as I looked at everything I was supposed to carry and thought about all the things I was supposed to know, I had to wonder: Do all girls go through this? Is every girl on a date really in deep cover? \"And, don\u0027t forget…\" I looked up to see the silver cross swinging back and forth on its chain. \"It\u0027s broken,\" I told Bex. \"It hasn\u0027t worked right since the water from the tank shorted it out; and you still wouldn\u0027t have been able to pick up the signal because of the jammers.\" \"Cammie,\" Bex said, sighing. \"Cammie, Cammie, Cammie…this is your legend.\" The cross kept swinging. \"This is how it\u0027s accessorized.\" I knew she was right. As soon as I crossed that fence, I had to stop being me and start being that other person—the homeschooled girl who wore that necklace and … \"You have got to be kidding me!\" I snapped, but it was too late, Liz had appeared in the doorway, holding Onyx. And I thought this boy business was hard before I had to rub a cat all over my body to give the hair-covered illusion of a feline-lover. All these years I\u0027d thought being a spy was challenging. Turns out, being a girl is the tricky part. They walked with me downstairs to the most remote of the secret passageways. \"Did you check your flashlight?\" Liz asked, the way Grandma Morgan always says \"Do you have your ticket?\" whenever they take me to the airport. It was sweet. I wished they could go with me, but that\u0027s something every spy learns early in the game—it doesn\u0027t matter how skilled your team is, there will come a time when you have to go on alone. As we walked along, Macey said, \"I still don\u0027t understand how you\u0027re going to get out and back in without getting caught.\" She sounded genuinely confused, but I wasn\u0027t. Someday, I really ought to write a book about the mansion. I could probably make a fortune selling copies to the newbies, sharing tricks like how you can jiggle the door of the janitor\u0027s closet in the west stairwell, then slide down a pipe all the way to the butler\u0027s pantry. (How you get back up is up to you.) Another good one is the wooden panel on the landing of the stone staircase in the old chapel. If you press it three times, it will pop open, and from there, you have ceiling access to every room in the North Hall. (I just wouldn\u0027t recommend this one if you are in any way afraid of spiders.) \"You\u0027ll see, Macey,\" I told her as we turned to walk down a long stone corridor toward the old ruby-colored tapestry that hung alone on the cold stone wall. I looked at the Gallagher family tree, and then at Macey. She didn\u0027t study the generations, didn\u0027t find her own name there or ask questions; she just said, \"You look good,\" and I nearly passed out from the shock of such high praise. I pulled the tapestry aside and started to slip in, just as Bex said, \"Knock \u0027em dead!\" I was already inside when Liz yelled after me, \"But not literally!\" Chapter Fourteen I don\u0027t know how I let them talk me into it. Well, I do, but you\u0027ll never hear me admit it out loud. Sneaking outside the campus grounds was one thing—that was merely a matter of memorizing the sweeping grids of the cameras, knowing the blind spots of the guards, and circumventing the motion detectors along the south wall. But wearing shoes that made the sneaking infinitely more difficult was something I will never be proud of. Sure, Macey\u0027s black boots elongated my legs and gave me an aura of Charlie\u0027s Angels-ness, but by the time I was in position on a park bench at the corner of the town square, my feet were sore, my ankle was twisted, and my nerves were shot.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-17.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies.
