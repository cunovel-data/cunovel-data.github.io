{"id":82992,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Bex was on the far side of the square, milling around outside the library while the Pride of Roseville marching band warmed up. Liz was supposed to be behind me, but I couldn\u0027t see her. (Please tell me she didn\u0027t bring her molecular regeneration homework…) Mr. Smith was probably thirty feet in front of Bex, being Joe Ordinary, which was totally creeping me out. Every few moments I\u0027d catch a flash of his black jacket as he strolled along the streets, looking like a soccer dad who was worried about the mortgage, and I remembered that of all the false façades at the Gallagher Academy, the best belonged to its people. \"How you doing up there, Duchess?\" I asked, and Bex shot back, \"I hate that bloody code name.\" \"Okay, Princess,\" I said. \"Cam—\" Bex started, but before she could finish her threat, I heard Liz\u0027s voice in my ear. \"Chameleon, where are you?\" Liz complained. \"I lost you again.\" \"I\u0027m over by the dunk tank, Bookworm.\" \"Wave your arms or something.\" I could almost hear Liz standing on tiptoes, peering through the crowd. \"That kind of defeats the purpose now, doesn\u0027t it?\" Bex noted. \"But how am I supposed to follow you, following Smith if I can\u0027t— Oh, never mind,\" Liz said. \"I see you.\" I looked around and thought, Oh, yeah, I can see why I\u0027d be tough to spot. I was sitting on a bench in plain sight. Seriously. I couldn\u0027t have been more out in the open if I\u0027d had a big neon sign over my head. But that\u0027s the thing most people don\u0027t get about surveillance. No one—not even one of my best friends—was going to look twice at an ordinary-looking girl in last year\u0027s clothes sitting on a park bench eating a corn dog. If you can be still enough, and common enough, then it\u0027s really easy to be invisible. \"He\u0027s flipping,\" Bex said softly, and I knew it was showtime. Roseville might look like Mayberry, but Professor Smith wasn\u0027t taking any chances. He was doubling back, so I got off my bench and eased toward the sidewalk, knowing Smith was heading toward me on the opposite side of the square, past Bex, who managed to duck her head and act nonchalant. That\u0027s when a lot of people would have lost it. An amateur would have looked at her watch and spun around as if she\u0027d just remembered some place she needed to be, but not Bex—she just kept walking. Half the town must have turned out for the carnival, so there was lots of pedestrian cover on the sidewalk between Mr. Smith and me (a very good thing). People don\u0027t see things nearly as quickly as they see motion, so when Professor Smith turned, I stayed perfectly still. When he moved, I waited five seconds, then followed. But mostly, I remembered what my dad always said about how a tail isn\u0027t a string—it\u0027s a rubber band, stretching back and forth, in and out, moving independently of The Subject. When something interested me, I stopped. When someone said something funny, I laughed. When I passed an ice-cream stand, I bought some, all the while keeping Mr. Smith at the edge of my vision. But that\u0027s not to say it was easy. No way. In all the times I\u0027d imagined my first mission, I\u0027d always thought I\u0027d be retrieving top secret files or something. Never once did I imagine that I\u0027d be asked to tail my COW professor through a carnival and find out what he drinks with his funnel cakes. The crazy thing was that this was SO MUCH HARDER! Professor Smith was acting as if those KGB hitmen were already on their way to Roseville—using every countersurveillance technique in the book (or at least the books I\u0027ve seen), and I realized how exhausting it must be to be him. He couldn\u0027t even go out for funnel cakes without \"flipping\" and \"corner clearing\" and \"breadcrumbing\" all the time. Once, things got really toasty, and I thought for sure he was going to make me, but I fell in behind a group of little old women. But then one of the women stumbled at the curb, and, instinctively, I reached out to help her. Ahead of us, Professor Smith stopped in front of a darkened storefront, staring at the reflection in the glass, but I was twenty feet behind him and shrouded by a sea of gray hair and polyester—which was a good thing. But then the women all turned to face me—which was a bad thing. \"Thank you, young lady,\" the older woman said. She squinted at me. \"Do I know you?\" But just then, a voice blared in my ear. \"Did we rotate?\" Liz sounded close to panic. \"Did we rotate the eyeball?\" Professor Smith was getting away, heading back in Bex\u0027s direction, so I answered, \"Yes,\" but that only made the woman cock her eyebrow and stare harder. \"I don\u0027t remember seeing you before,\" the old woman said. \"Sure you do, Betty,\" one of the other women said, patting her friend on the arm. \"She\u0027s that Jackson girl.\" And that\u0027s why I\u0027m the chameleon. I am the girl next door (it\u0027s just that our doors have fingerprint-reading sensors and are bulletproof and all…). \"Oh! Is your grandmother out of the hospital yet?\" the more fragile of the women asked. Okay, so I didn\u0027t know the Jacksons, much less how Granny was feeling, but Grandma Morgan had taught me that Chinese Water Torture is nothing compared to a grandmother who really wants to know something. I saw Professor Smith nearing Bex, but over my comms unit, Bex was laughing, saying, \"Yeah, man. Go, Pirates!\" as if she lived for Friday night football. Sure, Bex\u0027s definition of football might have been soccer, but boys were always boys, and a crowd of jersey-clad testosterone was assembling across the street. I didn\u0027t need surveillance photos to know who was at the center of the mob. The old women were staring at me as if I were a needle they were trying to thread, and I said the only thing I could think of. \"Dr. Smith says she needs to go south—that she needs to be toasty.\" I looked past the mob surrounding me and toward the one surrounding Bex, hoping she\u0027d heard and understood that trouble was heading her way. My hopes dwindled, though, when I heard her say, \"Yeah, I love tight ends.\" \"Isn\u0027t that nice?\" the old woman said. \"Does she know where she\u0027s going?\" I saw Mr. Smith\u0027s dark jacket disappear past the pillars of the library\u0027s main entrance and then out of sight. \"You know she\u0027s such a bookworm,\" I said, hoping Liz was listening. \"She can\u0027t wait to be near the library, just around the corner from the library, in fact,\" I said through gritted teeth, just as static and chaos filled my ears. I heard Bex mutter, \"Oh, no!\" Ahead of me, the football boys were heading in a pack down the street, but Bex wasn\u0027t with them. As far as I could see, Bex wasn\u0027t anywhere, and neither was Smith. \"Sorry, ladies. Gotta go,\" I snapped and hurried away. \"Bookworm,\" I said, \"do you have them? I have lost visual with The Subject and the eyeball. I repeat. I have lost visual with The Subject and the…\" I reached the library and looked in the direction where I\u0027d last seen Mr. Smith, but all I saw was a long line of yellow streetlights. I weaved back through the crowd, circling the entire square, until I wound up right back where I\u0027d started, in a vacant lot between a shoe store and City Hall, right behind the dunk tank. I should have been more aware of my surroundings, I know—Spy 101 and all that—but it was too late. We\u0027d been so close … soooo close. I hadn\u0027t wanted to admit it to myself, but about the time I polished off that ice-cream cone, I\u0027d honestly started imagining what it would feel like to have Joe Solomon say, \"Nice job.\" But now they were gone—everyone—Smith, Bex, and Liz. I couldn\u0027t turn tail and run back to school—not then. We\u0027d come too close. So I darted toward the funnel-cake stand, the one place we felt certain Smith would have to visit before the night was through, but I didn\u0027t pay attention to where I was going or how completely the Deputy Chief of Police filled the little seat above the dunk tank. I heard the crack of a baseball hitting metal, sensed movement out of the corner of my eye, but all the P\u0026E training in the world wasn\u0027t enough to help me dodge the tidal wave that crashed over my shoulders. Yeah, that\u0027s right. My first covert operations mission was also my first wet T-shirt contest, and as I stood there shivering, I knew it would probably be my last of both. People were rushing toward me, offering towels, asking if they could give me a ride home. Yeah, I\u0027m stealthy, I thought, as I thanked them as unmemorably as possible and darted away. Halfway down the sidewalk, I pulled a soggy twenty-dollar bill from my pocket, bought a Go Pirates! sweatshirt, and pulled it on. In my ear, the comms unit had gone from crackling static to dense nothing, and I realized with a thud that my little silver cross, though state-of-the-art, wasn\u0027t the waterproof edition. Bex\u0027s band of football jocks strolled by, but not a single eye looked my way. As a girl, I wouldn\u0027t have minded a little corner-of-the-eye checking out, but as a spy, I was totally relieved that the whole drowned-chic look didn\u0027t undermine my covertness too much. I walked toward the funnel-cake stand, knowing that at any minute I could turn the corner on disaster—and I guess in a way, I did. Bex and Liz were sitting together on a bench as Mr. Smith paced before them, and boy, was he scary just then. His new face had always seemed strong, but I hadn\u0027t appreciated its hard lines until he leaned over Liz and yelled, \"Ms. Sutton!\" Liz started shrinking, but Bex crossed her arms and looked totally bored. \"I want to know what you are doing here!\" Smith demanded. \"Ms. Baxter\"—he turned to Bex—\"you are going to tell me why you and Ms. Sutton have left campus. You are going to explain why you\u0027ve been following me for thirty minutes, and …\" I watched his expression change as something dawned on him. \"And you are going to tell me where Joe Solomon is right now.\" Bex and Liz looked at each other for a long time before Bex turned back to Mr. Smith. \"I had a craving for a corn dog.\" Well, I have already pointed out the corn dog inadequacy of the Gallagher Academy food service team, but Mr. Smith didn\u0027t buy her argument, which was just as well. He wasn\u0027t supposed to. He\u0027d heard her real message loud and clear—Bex and Liz weren\u0027t talking. Those are my girls. Then I remembered that I was probably supposed to be doing something! After all, the mission wasn\u0027t over yet—not really. There was still hope. Surely I could salvage some of it. Surely… I was really starting to hate Joe Solomon. First he sends us out to tail a guy who was almost bound to catch at least one of us, and then he doesn\u0027t teach us what to do when we get caught! Was I supposed to cause a diversion and hope Bex and Liz could slip away? Was I supposed to find a weapon and jump Smith from behind? Or was I simply supposed to stroll across the street and take my rightful place beside them on that bench of shame? From the corner of my eye, I saw the Overnight Express truck cruise by. It could have stopped and an army could have swarmed in and saved the day, but that didn\u0027t happen; and I instantly knew why. The street was full of people who could never know the power of the girls on the bench. I could have saved the sisters, but not at the risk of the sisterhood. \"Get up,\" Mr. Smith told Liz. He tossed a Dr Pepper bottle into a nearby trash can. \"We\u0027ll finish this discussion back at school.\" I stayed in the shadows and watched Bex and Liz walk by. You know you\u0027re stealthy if your two best friends in the universe can pass within twenty feet of you and don\u0027t have a clue you\u0027re there. But it was for the best, I figured. After all, I was still a girl on a mission.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-9.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies. Even though Cammie is fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways, she has no idea what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks she\u0027s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, or track him through town with the skill of a real \"pavement artist\"-but can she maneuver a relationship with someone who can never know the truth about her?
