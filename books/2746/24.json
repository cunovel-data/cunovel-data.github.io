I tugged at the hem of my skirt and fingered my corsage, feeling naked since I hadn\u0027t known to wear my mother\u0027s pearls. (Even the ones without the microfilm reader could have come in handy.) There were a lot of things I wanted to ask, like How do you stay so clean? and Does that tooth-whitening gum really work? but I couldn\u0027t say any of that, so I just stood there like an idiot, smiling at her, clinging to my cover. \"Are your parents here, darling?\" she asked, and then started scanning the crowd. \"No,\" I said, \"they\u0027re … busy.\" \"Oh, what a shame,\" she said, with a tilt of her head. But she didn\u0027t give me time to reply before blurting, \"Cammie, I want you to feel as welcome in our house as you do your own.\" Immediately, I started fantasizing about the recon we could set up with that kind of access, but all I could manage to say was, \"Oh … Um … Thanks.\" The band changed songs, and Mrs. Abrams leaned close to yell through the noise, \"What\u0027s your favorite kind of pie?\" I barely heard her, and was on the verge of shouting, \"I\u0027m not a spy!\" when I saw Dillon standing on a bale of straw, waving wildly in our direction. Josh glanced at his mother but didn\u0027t have to say a word before she said, \"Okay, darling. You kids go have fun.\" And then she gave me another hug. THREE HUGS! This was seriously freaking me out. \"Cammie, darling, you just come over any time, okay? And when you get a chance, give our number to your parents. Maybe they\u0027d be interested in joining our bridge club.\" The last bridge my parents had anything to do with involved the Gansu Province, dynamite, and a really ticked-off yak, but I just smiled and said, \"Thanks.\" As Josh pulled me away, I risked a glance back. Mr. Abrams had his arm around his wife\u0027s shoulders, and Mrs. Abrams raised her hand in a sad half-wave, as if she were freezing that bit of Josh in space and time. So those are normal parents. I studied the boy beside me who longed for a life in Mongolia and wasn\u0027t allowed to leave the house in anything wrinkled or stained, and another piece of his code fell into place—he was a little less encrypted. I started walking toward Dillon and the crowd of kids our age (if you\u0027re going to do the deep-cover thing you might as well do it all the way), but Josh tugged at my hand, stopping me. \"Come on, let\u0027s dance.\" \"But\"—I pointed to the teenage mob—\"aren\u0027t those your friends?\" Josh looked at them. \"Yeah, those are the kids from my school.\" \"If you want to go say hi or something …\" \"Let me think,\" he said, teasing. \"I could dance with the prettiest girl at the party or go hang out with a bunch of idiots I see all day every day. What do you think?\" I thought he was getting some serious bonus points for the prettiest girl at the party line, was what I thought, but that didn\u0027t stop me from looking at him in a new way as he steered us to the opposite side of the barn, away from his friends, away from his parents. For the first time, I realized I might not be the only one in deep cover. We danced for a long time before Josh said, \"Thanks for meeting my parents. They\u0027re big on that.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"They\u0027re really nice.\" \"They\u0027re psycho,\" he corrected me. \"Did you hear what he said? About the store? He seriously thinks everyone in this town would die if it weren\u0027t for him.\" He shook his head. \"You\u0027re so lucky no one cares what you do. I mean, you can be anything you want to be. No one\u0027s waiting on you to be some kind of chosen one.\" \"No,\" I said. \"I guess no one is.\" Lie—absolute, total, and complete lie. He pulled me tighter, which was a good thing for two reasons, because A) it kept him from seeing the tears that were forming at the corners of my eyes, threatening to test the waterproofness of Macey\u0027s new mascara, and B) it gave me pretty good cover, which I was about to totally need. In fact, no spy in the history of the known universe has ever needed cover more. \"Oh my gosh!\" I gasped and ducked, hiding my head behind Josh\u0027s shoulder. \"What?\" he said. \"Oh, um, I just stubbed my toe,\" I lied, because that was hardly the time to say, Hey Josh, speaking of parents, MY MOM JUST WALKED IN WITH MY COVEOPS TEACHER! Across the dance floor, Mom was in Mr. Solomon\u0027s arms. They were both totally laughing, and he was twirling her, and her hair was flying around like she was in a shampoo commercial. Seriously. She could have sold conditioner to a bald man the way she looked out there. I started easing toward the shadows, far away from the main doors, cursing myself for not marking all the exits earlier. I was stupid. STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. \"I think I want to sit down for a while.\" I found a stretch of shadowy space at the back of the barn, beneath the hayloft, far away from Mom and Mr. Solomon. \"Do you want some punch?\" he asked. \"YES! Punch sounds great!\" I watched Josh disappear into the crowd, and for a second the panic stopped and I felt another feeling in my gut, like the ground had been swept out from under me. But it wasn\u0027t just nerves. I was flying, hurtling through the sky. Literally. Chapter Twenty Oh my gosh! I thought but didn\u0027t scream—partly because all the air had been jerked out of my lungs, and partly because Bex had one hand clamped over my mouth. Liz was looking at me through the pale light that floated into the hayloft from the party below, the noise muffled by bales of last year\u0027s straw. \"Cammie,\" Liz said patiently, as if trying to wake me from a deep sleep. \"We had to get you out of there. Your mom and Solomon—they\u0027re here!\" That\u0027s when I looked around the hayloft and saw the series of pulleys the girls had constructed—the wires that were tied to Bex and to me—and I suddenly understood why I felt like a fish Grandpa Morgan had just jerked out of the water. Even Macey was there, lying on her stomach, peering over the edge of the loft. \"We\u0027re good.\" She rolled onto her side to face us. \"The shadows are so thick back there; I don\u0027t think anyone saw.\" \"Oh my gosh,\" I finally said. For someone who was technically involved in her first act of espionage, Macey was acting pretty calm about it— like maybe Tina\u0027s theory that she had once blackmailed the editor of Vogue into bringing back gaucho pants was actually true. Liz, on the other hand, was freaking out. \"Cammie, did you hear me?\" she nearly shouted. \"Your mom and Solomon are here! They\u0027re here! They could have seen you! Do you know what would happen if they saw you?\" \"I know,\" I said as I sank to the floor of the loft. I breathed in the sweet smell of the hay and waited for my heart to stop pounding. Then I realized something. \"They didn\u0027t see me,\" I said. \"But how can you be sure?\" This time, Bex answered. \"Because she isn\u0027t dead yet.\" The hayloft was dark and at least thirty feet above the heart of the party, so Bex and Liz sank to the floor and together we crawled toward Macey and the edge. Dim lights twinkled below us, and the band played a slow song. I watched my mom dance with Mr. Solomon. She rested her head on his shoulder, and suddenly, having them skin me alive seemed like a totally better option than watching that. \"Wow,\" Macey muttered. \"Killer couple.\" But I don\u0027t know if she meant it literally. \"Oh, Cammie,\" Liz said, \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027re just here as friends. Right, Bex?\" Bex was speechless. Oh my gosh! \"I mean, I\u0027m sure they\u0027re just—\" Liz tried to make things better, but it was Macey who said, \"Don\u0027t worry, they aren\u0027t dating or in love or anything.\" She sounded so decisive—so sure. I looked at her, wondering How can she possibly know such a thing! Then I remembered—she was Macey McHenry! Of course she knew! I was totally starting to feel better until she added a fateful, \"Yet,\" and I thought I was going to be sick. I couldn\u0027t watch any more, so I turned away and asked, \"How did this happen?\" \"After you turned your mom down, I saw her talking to double-O-hottie down there,\" Macey said. \"And they decided to go do something.\" \"And we knew something like this could happen, so we slipped a tracker into your mom\u0027s purse,\" Bex said smugly, loving the situation a little too much, if you ask me. \"And we activated the tracker in Josh\u0027s shoe.\" Liz held her wrist toward me, and suddenly I saw two red dots blinking side by side, as beneath us, Josh carried two cups of punch through the party, passing inches away from my mother. \"And then we decided you might need an emergency operative extraction,\" Liz said, reveling in the chance to quote one of her flash cards. I threw my arms over my head, burying my face in the sweet-smelling hay, willing it all to be a dream, and I had almost succeeded when I heard, \"Nice corsage.\" I looked up and glared at Macey, who shrugged and said, \"What? Like you didn\u0027t think it?\" But that was hardly the time to explain. Oh, no, we totally had better things to do, as Bex was no doubt aware, because she was backing farther into the shadows, saying, \"Come on. One operative extraction coming up.\" Before I knew what was happening, Bex was pulling me to my feet and hooking me to the cable, and Macey was pushing open the loft door to the chilly autumn night, getting ready to lower me outside like a great big bale of hay. \"No,\" I said, but Liz pushed me out the door. \"I can\u0027t,\" I cried, but I was spinning around and around in midair. Before I knew it, Liz was joining me on the ground, followed by Macey, who bolted for the trees that lined the edges of the pasture. \"Liz, I can\u0027t do this,\" I said as I gripped my friend\u0027s skinny shoulders. \"I\u0027ve got to get back inside, somehow.\" \"Have you gone completely bonkers?\" Bex said as she joined us on the ground. \"But Josh is in there,\" I protested. \"So are your mother and Mr. Solomon,\" Bex pointed out. She jerked the stretch of cable I was holding, and it burned through my hands. \"Bex, I can\u0027t just leave him! He\u0027ll worry. He\u0027ll start looking and asking around and…\" \"She\u0027s right,\" I heard Liz saying. \"It\u0027s a direct violation of CoveOps rule number—\" But I was never going to know which CoveOps rule that violated, because just then a big ruby-colored flash came zooming out of the forest. \"Get in!\" Macey cried from the driver\u0027s seat. For a moment, I didn\u0027t know which was more surprising, the fact that my classmates had come to rescue me in a Gallagher Academy golf cart or that Bex had let Macey drive (although, when you think about it, Macey probably did have way more golf-cart experience than the rest of us). When Liz saw the dazed look on my face, she blushed and said, \"Let\u0027s just say Bubblegum Guard is going to wake up in a few hours, amazed that his sinus medicine made him so drowsy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-24.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies. Even though Cammie is fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways, she has no idea what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks she\u0027s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, or track him through town with the skill of a real \"pavement artist\"-but can she maneuver a relationship with someone who can never know the truth about her? Cammie Morgan may be an elite spy-in-training, but in her sophomore year, she\u0027s on her most dangerous mission-falling in love.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.jpg","author":"Ally Carter","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:18 PM"}}
