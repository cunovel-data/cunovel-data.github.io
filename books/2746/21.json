{"id":83004,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"I\u0027m with Interpol now.\" Max Edwards said, eyeing me. \"I know you\u0027re a CIA legacy and all, but that\u0027s no reason not to give the rest of us a shot, eh?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Started the CoveOps training yet?\" \"Yes, sir, with the intro class.\" \"Good. Good. I\u0027m sure Joe Solomon is finding plenty to teach you,\" he said, patting me on the-shoulder, emphasizing the word in a way I didn\u0027t understand. Then he leaned closer and whispered, \"I\u0027m going to give you some advice, Cammie. Not everyone can live this life, you know. Not everyone has it in their blood—the stress, the risk, the sacrifice.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card with a phone number centered and alone on the plain white background. \"Call me anytime. You\u0027ll always have a place with us.\" He patted me on the shoulder again and walked away, his footsteps echoing down the empty stone corridor. I watched him turn the corner; then I counted to ten and slipped behind the tapestry. Halfway down the tunnel, I stopped and changed my clothes. I never saw that card again. Chapter Seventeen I know in spy movies it always looks really cool when the operative goes from a maid\u0027s uniform to a slinky, sexy ballgown in the amount of time it takes an elevator to climb three floors. Well, I don\u0027t know how it is for TV spies, but I can tell you that even with Velcro, the art of the quick change is one that must take a lot of practice (not to mention better lighting than one is likely to find in a tunnel that was once a part of the Underground Railroad). That\u0027s probably why I panicked when I saw the strange look on Josh\u0027s face when he first saw me outside the gazebo. Either my blouse was open, or my skirt was stuck in my underwear, or something even more mortifying. I froze. \"You look …\" I have lipstick on my teeth. My hair is full of cobwebs. I\u0027m wearing two different kinds of shoes and my backup is two whole miles away! \"… amazing.\" I\u0027d never felt less invisible in my life. I forgot about Bex and Macey and their great bodies, Liz and her gorgeous blond hair. Even my mother faded from my mind as I saw myself through Josh\u0027s eyes. For the first time in a long time I didn\u0027t want to disappear. Then I remembered that it was my turn to say something. He was wearing a leather jacket and khaki pants that had the kind of crisp creases that made me think of the Navy SEALs, who were probably doing a demonstration in the Gallagher Academy pond at that very moment, so I said, \"You look very…clean.\" \"Yeah.\" He tugged at his collar. \"My mom found out and … well… let\u0027s just say you were this close to having to wear a wrist corsage.\" He held two fingers inches apart, and I remembered one time when my dad got my mom a corsage— of course it came equipped with a retinal scanner and comms unit, but still, the thought was nice. I started to say so, but just then Josh said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but we kind of missed the movie. I should have looked up the times before I asked you. It started at six.\" The mission was compromised at 19:00 hours when The Operative and The Subject realized they had missed their window of opportunity—which in The Operative\u0027s opinion was a waste of her best outfit. \"Oh,\" I said, trying not to sound too heartbroken. I\u0027d let Liz do my hair. I\u0027d jogged two miles in the dark. I had been looking forward to this all week, but all I could do was put on my best spy face and say, \"That\u0027s okay. I guess I\u0027ll just…\" \"Do you want to grab a burger?\" Josh blurted before I could finish my thought. Grab a burger? I\u0027d just eaten filet mignon with the Deputy Director of the CIA, but I found myself saying, \"I\u0027d love to!\" Across the square, bright lights beamed through one set of windows. We walked toward the light, and Josh held the door open for me and gestured for me to walk in (how sweet is that!). The diner had a black-and-white checkerboard floor with red vinyl booths and lots of old records and pictures of Elvis nailed to the walls. The whole place was a little too doo-woppy for my personal taste, but that didn\u0027t stop me from crawling into a booth—unfortunately on the side facing away from the windows since Josh had already nabbed the best position for himself. (Mr. Smith would have been very disappointed in me.) But at least across the booth he probably couldn\u0027t feel my leg shaking. The Operative tried to implement the Purusey breathing technique, which has been proven effective at fooling polygraphs. There is no conclusive evidence as to whether it is effective at masking the internal lie detectors of fifteen-year-old boys. The waitress came and took our orders, and Josh leaned way back in his seat. I knew from Liz\u0027s notes on body language that this meant he was feeling pretty confident (either that or I smelled like the tunnel and he wanted to get as far away from me as possible). \"I\u0027m sorry we missed the movie,\" Josh said as he rearranged his pickles. \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"This is fun, too.\" Then the strangest thing happened—we both stopped talking. It was like that episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer where everyone in town got their voices stolen. I was beginning to wonder if that had actually happened—like maybe, back at school, the CIA had been fiddling around with one of Dr. Fibs\u0027s experiments and something had gone horribly wrong. I started to open my mouth and test my theory, when I heard a muffled cry of \"Josh!\" and some banging on the diner windows, and I realized that the muteness hadn\u0027t affected anyone but us. When I heard the ding of the diner door, I spun to see a mob of teenagers heading our way, and let me tell you, for a girl who\u0027s gone to a private all-girls school since the seventh grade, that\u0027s a pretty scary sight. I have never been so behind enemy lines in my life! I thought, scrolling back through our P\u0026E training on how to handle multiple attackers. Normally, I might have counted on Josh—my guide in that strange and foreign land—but he was panicking, too. I could tell by the way his jaw had gone all slack and a french fry was poised, midair, en route to his mouth. I mentally reeled through the things in my favor: no one knew me. I wasn\u0027t wearing my uniform. And if push came to shove I could…well…push and shove. (Two of the boys looked pretty football player-ish, but I did an entire project once on the \"the bigger they are the harder they fall\" philosophy of hand-to-hand combat, and there is totally something to it.) I was safe, for the meantime. My cover might not have been blown, but I couldn\u0027t say the same for my confidence—especially when one of the girls, a very pretty blond, said, \"Hi, Josh,\" and he said, \"Hi, DeeDee.\" The Operative realized that the band of insurgents was led by the suspect known as DeeDee (even though she did not appear to have any pink paper in her possession). Most of the mob walked by with just the occasional \"Hey, Josh\" as they passed, but DeeDee and another boy crawled into the booth with us, and oh yeah, guess who ended up being pressed up against Josh? DEE DEE! (Soooo not an accident!) Can I just say that it is such a good thing that there was an entire diner full of witnesses, because I\u0027m fairly certain I could have killed her with a bottle of ketchup. \"Hi, I\u0027m DeeDee,\" she said as she helped herself to one of Josh\u0027s fries (rude!). \"Have we met?\" I\u0027m the daughter of two secret agents who has a genius IQ and the ability to kill you in your sleep and make it look like an accident, you silly, vapid, two-bit… \"Cammie\u0027s new in town.\" Okay, this is why it\u0027s always best to have backup. Josh totally saved me, because I was seriously starting to finger the ketchup bottle about then. \"Oh,\" she said. Even though Macey McHenry herself had done my makeup, I felt completely covered with boils as I sat there. She helped herself to another fry, but didn\u0027t look at me when she said, \"Hi.\" \"DeeDee and I have known each other for forever,\" Josh said, and DeeDee blushed. Two of the girls from the mob put some money in the jukebox and soon a song I\u0027d never heard was echoing throughout the diner, causing the boy who was sliding into the booth next to me to yell when he said, \"Yeah, she\u0027s just one of the boys.\" He thrust a hand in my direction. \"Hey, I\u0027m Dillon.\" THIS is Dillon? My superspy instincts were taken aback as I studied the small boy who was supposedly \"D\u0027Man.\" (Note to self: don\u0027t believe everything you read when hacking into the DMV, because short boys will totally lie about their height when applying for their learners\u0027 permits.) It took a second for me to recognize him and realize he\u0027d been the boy with Josh in the street—the one who\u0027d been told I was nobody. Somehow I managed to say, \"Hi. I\u0027m Cammie.\" Dillon was nodding his head slowly as he eyed me and said, \"So this is the mystery woman.\" DeeDee instantly stopped chewing on her fry. \"So she exists!\" Dillon exclaimed. \"You have to forgive my friend here,\" Dillon said as he slid one arm around my shoulders. \"He\u0027s not the most outgoing of hosts, so if I can do anything to help you feel at home here, consider me at your disposal.\" Dillon\u0027s arm was still around me, so I was feeling pretty grateful for all those P\u0026E classes when Josh reached across the table and punched Dillon in the shoulder. \"What?\" Dillon cried. \"I\u0027m just being hospitable.\" If that was hospitable then Madame Dabney really needed to update her curriculum. \"Well, Cammie,\" Dillon went on, unfazed, \"please allow me to say that I can see why doofus here\u0027s been keeping you to himself.\" Dillon reached for a fry, but this time Josh moved the plate away and said, \"Well, thanks for stopping by. Don\u0027t let us keep you.\" And then Josh tried to kick Dillon under the table, but he missed and hit me, but it\u0027s not like I screamed or anything. (I\u0027ve totally been kicked harder.) \"Are you kidding?\" Dillon asked, elbows-on-table as he lowered his voice, forcing us all to huddle around his conspiracy. \"We\u0027re gonna go climb the wall and moon some rich girls later. Wanna come?\" The wall? OUR wall? I wondered in disbelief. Is it possible I\u0027ve been routinely mooned for the past three years and didn\u0027t know it? Has Josh\u0027s very own backside been exposed (and possibly photographed by the security department) without my knowledge? (Note to self: find those photographs.) I must have looked as confused as I felt, because Josh leaned closer and said, \"The Gallagher Academy?\" as if wondering whether or not I\u0027d heard of the place. \"It\u0027s a really snooty boarding school. The girls there are all rich delinquents or something.\" I wanted to jump to our defense. I wanted to proclaim that you shouldn\u0027t judge someone until you\u0027ve walked a mile through an underground tunnel in her uncomfortable shoes. I wanted to tell them everything they owed to the Gallagher Girls who had gone before me, but I couldn\u0027t. Sometimes spies can only nod and say, \"Oh, really?\" \"What?\" Dillon said. \"You don\u0027t, like, go there?\" he asked, then laughed so loudly that everyone in the restaurant turned to stare. I studied Dillon and wondered how long it would take me to hack into the IRS—I bet, by December, Uncle Sam could be repossessing everything his family owned. \"I\u0027m homeschooled,\" I said, while silently chanting, And I have a cat named Suzie, and my dad\u0027s an engineer, and I love mint chocolate cookie ice cream.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-21.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies. Even though Cammie is fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways, she has no idea what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks she\u0027s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, or track him through town with the skill of a real \"pavement artist\"-but can she maneuver a relationship with someone who can never know the truth about her?
