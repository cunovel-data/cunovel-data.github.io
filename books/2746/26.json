{"id":83009,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"I didn\u0027t move; I just waited out the night. The school was quiet around me, and I let the silence calm my heartbreak, lull me into a sleepless trance as I stared past my reflection in the dark glass, and whispered, \"Happy birthday, Daddy.\"\\n\\n I stayed away as long as I could that Sunday morning, but by noon, I had to see my mother; I had to know that she was okay and apologize somehow for forgetting my father in that small way. I had to know if that was the beginning of the end of my memories.\\n\\n I burst through her office door, armed with a dozen excuses, but they all flew from my mind when I saw Mom, Mr. Solomon, and Buckingham staring at me as if I\u0027d just been beamed down from outer space. They shut up too quickly—something you\u0027d think spies would know better than to do. I didn\u0027t know what was more disturbing—the fact that something was obviously wrong, or that three faculty members of the world\u0027s premiere spy school had forgotten to lock the door.\\n\\n After what seemed like forever, Buckingham said, \"Cameron, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. You have firsthand experience in a matter we\u0027ve been discussing.\" At that moment it didn\u0027t matter that Patricia Buckingham had two bad hips and arthritic fingers, I still would have sworn she was made of steel. \"Of course, Rachel, you are Cameron\u0027s mother, not to mention headmistress of this school, so I would respect your opinion if you chose to ask Cameron to leave.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" my mom said. \"She\u0027s in now. She\u0027ll want to help.\"\\n\\n The whole vibe of the room was starting to seriously creep me out, so I said, \"What is it? What\u0027s—\"\\n\\n \"Close the door, Cameron,\" Buckingham instructed. I did as I was told.\\n\\n \"Abe Baxter missed a call-in,\" Mr. Solomon said, crossing his arms as he leaned on the corner of Mom\u0027s desk, just like I\u0027d seen him do a hundred times during CoveOps class. And yet, it didn\u0027t feel like a lecture. \"Actually, he\u0027s missed three call-ins.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t realize his words had knocked me off my feet until I felt my backpack pressing against my spine as I tried to lean back on the sofa. Does Bex know, I wondered for a split second before the obvious answer dawned on me: of course not.\\n\\n \"He may just be delayed, of course,\" Buckingham offered. \"These things happen—communications difficulties, changes in cell operation…This doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that his cover has been compromised. Still, three missed calls is … troubling.\"\\n\\n \"Is Bex\u0027s mom …\" I stumbled over my words. \"Is she with him?\"\\n\\n Mr. Solomon looked at Buckingham, who shook her head. \"Our friends at Six say no.\"\\n\\n And then I realized why Buckingham was in charge of that discussion—she had been MI6, just like Bex\u0027s parents. She had been the one to get the call. She was the one who was going to have to decide what, if anything, to tell Bex.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t mean anything,\" my mom soothed, but I heard traces of the woman I\u0027d seen the night before—traces I probably wouldn\u0027t have heard twenty-four hours earlier, but I knew they were there now, and I\u0027d be listening for them for the rest of my life.\\n\\n \"Bex …\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"We were just talking about her, Cam,\" Mom said. \"We don\u0027t know what to do.\"\\n\\n Say what you will about spies, but they don\u0027t do anything halfway. Our lies come complete with Social Security numbers and fake IDs, and our truths cut like Spanish steel. I knew what my mom was saying. I knew why she risked saying it to me. The Gallagher Academy was made of stone, but news like that could burn it to the ground as quickly as if it were built out of newspapers and painted with gasoline.\\n\\n \"Cam\"—Mom sat on the edge of the coffee table in front of me—\"this has happened before, of course, but each case is different, and you know Bex better than anyone—\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell her.\" The words surprised even me. I know we\u0027re supposed to be tough and hardened and in the process of being prepared for anything, but I didn\u0027t want her to know just because we were too weak to carry the secret on our own. I looked at my mother again, remembered how long it takes some wounds to heal, and realized there would be plenty of time for grieving.\\n\\n Bex\u0027s father was thousands of miles away, but she still had the promise of him. Who was I to take that away too soon? What would I have given for a few extra hours of it myself?\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Macey McHenry said behind me, and I instantly regretted showing her the small, ancient corridor and telling her it was a great place to study. \"That had better not be because of a boy.\"\\n\\n She dropped her stack of books beside me, but I couldn\u0027t look at her. Instead, I just sat there wiping away the tears I was crying quietly for Bex\u0027s father—swallowing the tears I was crying for my own. A long time passed. I don\u0027t know—maybe like a millennium or something—before Macey nudged me with her knee and said, \"Spill.\"\\n\\n Say what you will about Macey McHenry, but she really doesn\u0027t beat around the bush. A superspy would have lied to her—good lies, too. But I couldn\u0027t. Maybe it was stress. Maybe it was grief. Maybe it was PMS, but something made me look up at Macey and say, \"Bex\u0027s dad is missing. He might be dead.\"\\n\\n Macey slid to sit beside me. \"You can\u0027t tell her.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said, and then I blew my nose.\\n\\n \"When will they know for sure?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" And I didn\u0027t. \"Could be days. Could be months. He hasn\u0027t called his handler. If he calls, then …\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t tell her.\"\\n\\n Of course we couldn\u0027t, but something about that statement made me stop and look at her. I thought back on it, and for the first time, I heard the we. There were things I couldn\u0027t tell my mother, things I couldn\u0027t tell my boyfriend, and things I couldn\u0027t tell my friends. But sitting there with Macey McHenry, I realized for the first time that someone knew all my secrets—that I wasn\u0027t entirely alone.\\n\\n Macey stood and started to walk away. \"Cammie, no offense …\" When someone like Macey McHenry says \"no offense\" it\u0027s almost impossible for someone like me not to be offended by what she says next, but I tried. \"… but don\u0027t go up there now. You look like hell, and she\u0027ll see it.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t offended. I was actually glad she\u0027d said it, because it was true and I might not have realized it if Macey hadn\u0027t said so.\\n\\n Macey walked away, and I sat there for a long time— thinking. I remembered the time my dad took me to the circus. For two hours we sat side by side, watching the clowns and cheering for the lion tamer. But the part I remember most was when a man stepped out onto the high wire, fifty feet above the ground. By the time he reached the other side, five other people had climbed onto his shoulders, but I wasn\u0027t watching him—I was too busy staring at my father, who looked on as if he knew what it felt like, up there without a net.\\n\\n Sitting there that day, I knew that the only thing I could do was keep putting one foot in front of the other, hoping none of the secrets on my shoulders would make me lose my balance.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-two\\n\\n \"Eyes closed,\" Mr. Solomon commanded again, and we followed his instructions.\\n\\n The projector purred behind me. I felt its white light slicing through the room as we cinched our eyes together and trained our minds to recall even the most minute details of the things we had just seen. I thought about the photo of a supermarket parking lot as Mr. Solomon said, \"Ms. Alvarez, what\u0027s wrong with this picture?\"\\n\\n \"The blue van has handicapped plates,\" Eva said. \"But it\u0027s parked at the back of the lot.\"\\n\\n \"Correct. Next picture.\" The projector clicked, the image changed, and we had two seconds to study the photo that flashed before our eyes.\\n\\n \"Ms. Baxter?\" Mr. Solomon asked. \"What\u0027s wrong here?\"\\n\\n \"The umbrella,\" Bex said. \"There\u0027s rain on the window and the coat on the hook is damp, but the umbrella is bundled up. Most people leave them open to dry.\"\\n\\n \"Very good.\"\\n\\n When we opened our eyes, I didn\u0027t look at the screen, I looked at our teacher and wondered yet again how he could talk to Bex, challenge her as if nothing in the world was wrong. I didn\u0027t know whether to envy him or hate him, but I didn\u0027t have time for either, because he was saying, \"Eyes closed.\" I heard him take a step, and I wanted to know how he could stand there when all I wanted to do was run away. \"Ms. Morgan, what\u0027s wrong with this picture?\"\\n\\n \"Um … I didn\u0027t… I mean, I\u0027m …\"\\n\\n What was wrong was that I hadn\u0027t been able to look my best friend in the eye for days. What was wrong was that people like Abe Baxter live and die, and the whole world goes on—never knowing what they\u0027ve sacrificed. There was so much wrong that I didn\u0027t know where to start.\\n\\n \"Okay. How about you, Ms. Bauer?\"\\n\\n \"The teacup at the head of the table,\" Courtney said.\\n\\n \"What about it?\"\\n\\n \"Its handle is facing the wrong way.\"\\n\\n \"So it is,\" Mr. Solomon said as the lights in the classroom flickered to life and we all squinted against the glare.\\n\\n Our internal clocks were telling us the same thing— class wasn\u0027t over.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got something for you today, ladies,\" Mr. Solomon said as he handed a stack of papers to each girl in the front row.\\n\\n Liz\u0027s hand was instantly in the air.\\n\\n \"No, Ms. Sutton,\" Mr. Solomon said before Liz could even ask the question. \"This isn\u0027t a test, and it\u0027s not for a grade. Your school just needs you to say in black and white whether you are going to keep studying covert operations next semester.\"\\n\\n All around me, my classmates started filling out the form—a check mark here, a signature there, until Mr. Solomon stepped forward and snapped, \"Ladies\"—he paused as everyone looked up—\"my colleague Mr. Smith is fond of saying, \u0027It is a big world full of dark corners and long memories.\u0027 Do not\"—he paused, surveying us, and I could have sworn his stare lingered on me—\"take this decision lightly.\"\\n\\n Bex poked me in the shoulder. When I turned around, she flashed a big thumbs-up and mouthed the words \"This is awesome!\"\\n\\n I looked back down at the form in my hands, rubbed it between my fingers, and tried to smell if there was poison in the ink.\\n\\n It\u0027s just paper, I told myself. Ordinary paper. But then that very fact sent chills down my spine as I realized the form wasn\u0027t on Evapopaper. It wasn\u0027t meant to dissolve and wash away. I caught Joe Solomon\u0027s eye, and I\u0027m pretty sure he saw me notice that—the permanence of what it meant. And even though it wasn\u0027t meant to be eaten, I still got a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-three\\n\\n Now, you may think that if you\u0027re a Gallagher Girl dating a boy from Roseville that the best thing in the world would be having Tina Walters come running up to you at breakfast, exclaiming, \"Cammie, I talked to your mom, and she said we can all walk into town on Saturday!\"\\n\\n You may think that—but you\u0027d be wrong.\\n\\n Every moment I spent in town while it was swarming with Gallagher Girls was a moment they could see me with Josh, or Josh could see me with them. Still, I looked at Bex across the breakfast table, felt the sadness that I\u0027d been carrying for days, and even though Liz whispered, \"Cam, it\u0027s a big risk,\" I knew I had to go. I needed a few hours of forgetting.\\n\\n Saturday morning, the suites were buzzing as girls collected their Christmas shopping lists and checked what movies were playing. (I\u0027d already seen them both with Josh, of course.) Some of us rode into town in Gallagher Academy vans, but I chose to walk with the rest of the sophomores— amazed at how that familiar terrain looked by the light of day. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-26.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) \\n Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class.
