{"id":83010,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"When we reached the edge of town, I started rubbing my temples. \"Oh,\" I said, \"my head is killing me. Does anybody have any aspirin?\" My classmates checked their pockets and purses, but no one could find any little bottles of pills (probably because I\u0027d stolen them all the night before). \"You guys go on without me,\" I said, when we reached the square. \"I\u0027m gonna run to the pharmacy.\" Not a lie. \"The movie\u0027s gonna start in ten minutes,\" Bex reminded me, but I was already walking away, calling after them, \"I\u0027ll meet you in there.\" As plans go, it was a pretty good one. I could spend two hours with Josh, then sneak into the back of the theater, say something about the movie on the way home, and they\u0027d never know I hadn\u0027t been there all along. The door dinged when I pushed inside. I\u0027d never been to the pharmacy with Josh. It had always seemed better not to see him there. But he\u0027d told me his dad was making him work on Saturdays, and having permission to be in town was too good an opportunity to pass up. I walked to the counter and spoke to the woman behind it. \"Hi. Is Josh here?\" \"Well, hello, Cammie,\" a man said behind me. I turned to see Mr. Abrams walking my way. He was wearing a white smock with his name embroidered above the pocket. I felt like I was getting ready to have my teeth cleaned. \"This is a nice surprise.\" \"Oh, hello, Mr. Abrams.\" \"Is this your first trip to our little store?\" \"Yes, it is. It\u0027s …\" I looked around at the long rows of cough syrups and greeting cards and bandages for every occasion. \"…nice.\" Mr. Abrams beamed. \"Well, Josh just ran out to make a delivery. Ought to be right back, though. In the meantime, I want you to go over to the counter and order up any kind of ice cream you want—on the house. How\u0027s that sound?\" I glanced behind me to see an old-fashioned soda fountain stretching across the far wall. \"That sounds great!\" Totally not a lie. Mr. Abrams smiled at me and started toward a set of narrow stairs, but before climbing, he turned and said, \"Cammie, you come back any time.\" He disappeared around a corner. I was almost sad to watch him go. The ice-cream counter was smooth against my hands as I walked in front of the huge mirror that hung behind the bar. The woman from the counter followed me over and slipped on an apron as I climbed onto one of the old metal stools. A sign above the bar read \"Proudly serving Coca-Cola since 1942.\" There was a tall glass jar full of straws. The woman didn\u0027t bat an eye when I ordered a double chocolate sundae, and for the first time in weeks I felt almost normal. Outside it was November and cold, but the sun was beaming through the glass storefront, warming my skin as I ate my ice cream and fell into a dreamy, sugar-induced trance. Then, I heard the jingling of the little brass bells above the door. I didn\u0027t turn around. I didn\u0027t have to. The woman who\u0027d been helping me pulled off her apron and headed toward the counter as I paused with a spoon halfway to my mouth and saw Anna Fetterman\u0027s reflection in the mirror behind the bar. \"Can you help me?\" Anna said, once the clerk drew near. \"I need to have my inhaler refilled.\" \"Sure, honey.\" The woman took the slip of paper from Anna\u0027s hand. \"Let me go check on this. It\u0027ll just be a minute.\" I was already off my stool and crouching behind an adult diapers display, when I realized that all I was really guilty of was eating a hot fudge sundae so soon after lunch, and let me tell you—Anna has seen me eat way more than that (a certain incident involving Doritos, squirty cheese, and the winter Olympics comes to mind), so I was just getting ready to go say hi, when I heard something that made me freeze. The bells rang again, and I glanced through the shelves to see Dillon and a bunch of boys from the barn dance walk in. But they didn\u0027t walk down the aisles. No. They\u0027d already found what they were looking for. \"Hey, don\u0027t I know you?\" Dillon asked, but he wasn\u0027t talking to me. It was worse. He was talking to Anna, and he wasn\u0027t simply asking a question. His words were too sharp. His tone too predatory as he stepped closer to little Anna Fetterman and said, \"No, wait, you don\u0027t go to my school.\" In the mirror above the bar I saw him crowd Anna against the shelves. \"I bet you go to the Gallagher Academy.\" Anna drew her purse to her chest as if he were going to grab it and run away. \"What a nice purse,\" Dillon said. \"Did your daddy buy you that purse?\" Anna\u0027s daddy is an eighth-grade biology teacher in Dayton, Ohio, but Dillon didn\u0027t know that and Anna couldn\u0027t tell him. She was clinging to her cover just as ardently as I was clinging to mine. The boys around Dillon started to laugh. And just like that I remembered why Gallagher Girls and town boys aren\u0027t supposed to mix. Anna stumbled backward, because, despite nearly three and a half years of P\u0026E training, she could hardly swat a fly. The town was swarming with Gallagher Girls that afternoon, but Dillon and his friends had found Anna. It wasn\u0027t an accident. Anna was alone and weak, so obviously someone like Dillon would be there to try to thin her from the herd. \"I\u0027m just here to …\" Anna tried to speak, but her voice was barely more than a whisper. \"What\u0027s that?\" Dillon asked. \"I didn\u0027t hear you.\" \"I…\" Anna stuttered. I wanted to go to her, but I was frozen somehow— halfway between being her friend and being a homeschooled girl with a cat named Suzie. If I were one and not the other, I could have stopped it, but instead I told myself over and over, She\u0027ll be okay; she\u0027ll be okay; she\u0027ll be— \"What\u0027s the matter? Don\u0027t they teach you how to speak at the Gallagher Academy?\" Dillon said, and I would have given anything for Anna to bite back in Arabic, or Japanese, or Farsi, but she just took another backward step. Her elbow knocked a box of Band-Aids, and it teetered on the edge of the shelf. Anna inched toward the door and mumbled, \"I\u0027ll come back for—\" But a couple of Dillon\u0027s friends stepped in front of her, surrounding her with a wall of crimson lettermen\u0027s jackets, and I couldn\u0027t see her anymore. She\u0027ll be fine, I said again, willing it to be true. Which in a way it was, because just then the doorbells chimed, and in walked Macey McHenry. \"Hey, Anna.\" To my knowledge, Macey had never said more than two words to Anna Fetterman, but as she strolled through the door, her voice was light and free, and she sounded like the tiny girl\u0027s best friend in the world. \"What\u0027s going on?\" The four boys parted around Anna, backing away; maybe because of the way Macey chomped her gum then blew a bubble that popped in Dillon\u0027s face; maybe because they\u0027d never seen a girl so beautiful in person before. But Dillon didn\u0027t stray. \"Oh,\" he said smugly, looking Macey\u0027s amazing figure up and down. \"She has a friend.\" Anna looked at Macey as if she half suspected her classmate to say, Who me? I\u0027m not her friend. But Macey only fingered the bottles on the shelves, handing Anna a bottle of vitamin C. \"You should really take these.\" Macey walked down the aisle, examining the shelves, ignoring Dillon and the gang, who kept looking at their leader for directions. \"I should have known the Gallagher Academy wouldn\u0027t let its precious darlings out on their own,\" Dillon mocked. But Macey only smiled one of her patently beautiful smiles. \"Yeah,\" she said, eyeing his buddies. \"We\u0027re not brave like you.\" \"Is there a problem here?\" I knew the voice, but the accent was one Bex only used on rare occasions. To this day, I don\u0027t know how she got through the front door without setting off the chimes, but there she was, strolling past the Cold and Flu section, coming to stand on Anna\u0027s other side. I didn\u0027t know why she wasn\u0027t at the movie. I didn\u0027t care. It was three against four now, and Dillon didn\u0027t like those odds. Still, he managed to look at Bex and say, \"What\u0027s the matter? Is your yacht broken or something?\" Dillon snickered. The friends snickered. It was an idiot snicker-a-thon until Macey said, \"Not that I\u0027ve heard.\" \"Did you boys come over here to flirt with Anna?\" Bex said, laying on her faux charm. She pushed a petrified Anna toward the clan. \"Anna, tell the boys a little something about yourself.\" \"I have a boyfriend!\" she blurted in a way that told me it totally wasn\u0027t a lie. I was stunned. Bex was stunned. Even Macey took a second to recover. Anna has a boyfriend? In all this time, I\u0027d never thought that one of my classmates might have a boyfriend—especially not Anna. \"His name is Carl,\" she added. \"Sorry, boys,\" Bex said, sliding her arm around Anna\u0027s shoulder. \"Carl beat you to it.\" \"Oh, so they have boyfriends. Tell me, is Carl a townie?\" Dillon asked, as if he wanted to be let in on a secret. \"Do you girls like to go slumming?\" \"It\u0027s probably Carl Rockefeller,\" Macey added, and Bex squeezed Anna harder until she said, \"Yes. Carl Rockefeller. We know each other from the physics\"—another hard squeeze—this time with fingernails—\"um, yacht,\" Anna corrected, \"club.\" Two pats on Anna\u0027s shoulder told her she\u0027d done well. \"Hey,\" Dillon said, stepping forward as if he were tired of beating around the bush. \"I was wondering if you know someone I know…\" His voice trailed off. He leaned forward, and I just knew—I mean KNEW—that he was on to me, but then he said, \"The Queen of England.\" Well, Bex actually has met the queen, but obviously she wasn\u0027t about to say so. She just stood quietly as Dillon and his buddies laughed far too hard at the joke, making it even less funny. \"Honey, I got your—\" The woman behind the counter stopped abruptly when she saw four boys closing in on three girls. The only sound in the room was the white paper bag that held Anna\u0027s prescription as it crinkled in her hands. \"Thanks,\" Bex said, snatching the package. \"Is this all you needed?\" she asked Anna, who nodded, and the color slowly returned to her cheeks. \"How \u0027bout you?\" Macey asked Dillon. \"You get what you came for?\" But they didn\u0027t wait for his response. Instead, they walked together past a long shelf of magazines, where Macey\u0027s face stared out from the cover of Newsweek, along with the rest of the McHenry family, beneath a caption that read The Most Powerful Family in America? Dillon looked at it, then at her. Macey cocked a hip. \"We appreciate your vote.\" A long time after they\u0027d gone, I still couldn\u0027t turn away from the bells that were still ringing. I watched Anna stroll down the street with her saviors—with her friends. A hand circled my wrist, and Josh said, \"Hey.\" I saw his reflection in the mirror from the corner of my eye, but there was something through that window I couldn\u0027t turn away from. Liz was standing on the sidewalk, staring at me through the glass as if she didn\u0027t know me. As if she didn\u0027t want to. \"Hey, what\u0027s wrong?\" Josh asked, finally turning me to face him. \"What are you doing with those?\" He gestured to the half dozen bottles of aspirin I must have subconsciously gathered in my arms to throw like snowballs at Dillon and his cronies if help hadn\u0027t come. \"Oh.\" I looked down. \"I knocked them off and was picking them up.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1/page-27.html","bookId":2746,"book":{"id":2746,"title":"I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1)","description":"Storyline: I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls #1) Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, a fairly typical all-girls school-that is, if every school taught advanced martial arts in PE and the latest in chemical warfare in science, and students received extra credit for breaking CIA codes in computer class. The Gallagher Academy might claim to be a school for geniuses but it\u0027s really a school for spies. Even though Cammie is fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways, she has no idea what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks she\u0027s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, or track him through town with the skill of a real \"pavement artist\"-but can she maneuver a relationship with someone who can never know the truth about her? Cammie Morgan may be an elite spy-in-training, but in her sophomore year, she\u0027s on her most dangerous mission-falling in love.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.jpg","author":"Ally Carter","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/i-d-tell-you-i-love-you-but-then-i-d-have-to-kill-you-gallagher-girls-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:18 PM"}}
