{"id":7891,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII A YOUNG ARISTOCRAT","content":"After a drive of three miles, which was accomplished in a short time by the spirited horses, the carriage entered, through an ornamental gate, upon a smooth driveway, which led up to a handsome mansion, of large size, with a veranda stretching along the entire front. A boy, a little smaller than Herbert, ran out of the front door, and opened the door of the carriage before Pompey had time to descend from the box. “What, grandpa, come back?” he said, in surprise. “Yes, Oscar, we were too late for the train,” said his mother. “I brought you back a companion for a few hours. This is Herbert Mason, whom I intrust to your care, depending upon you to see that he passes his time pleasantly.” Oscar looked at Herbert inquisitively. Herbert offered his hand, saying, “I am glad to make your acquaintance, Oscar.” “How long are you going to stay?” asked Oscar, as his mother and grandfather went into the house. “I must return in time to take the twelve o\u0027clock train.” “Is grandpa going, too?” “Yes.” “And are you going to take care of him?” “I believe so.” “I wouldn\u0027t want to.\u0027 “Why not?” “Oh, it\u0027s an awful bore to be tied to a blind man.” “You\u0027d find it more of a bore to be blind yourself,” said Herbert. “Yes, I suppose I should. Grandpa wants me to go to walk with him sometimes, but I don\u0027t like it.” “If I had a grandfather who was blind, I think I should be willing.” “Wait till you have one, and you\u0027ll see how it is then.” “I suppose he needs somebody.” “Oh, well, he can take one of the servants, then. It\u0027s their business to work.” “Where do you live?” he asked, after a pause. “I am going to live in New York.” “Are you? I should like to go there.” “Perhaps you wouldn\u0027t want to go as I am going.” “What, alone? Yes, I should rather go that way. Then I could do as I pleased. Now it\u0027s \u0027Oscar, do this,\u0027 and \u0027You mustn\u0027t do that,\u0027 all the time.” “That isn\u0027t what I mean exactly. I\u0027ve got to earn my own living after I get there, and I don\u0027t know anybody in the city.” “You haven\u0027t run away from home, have you?” “I haven\u0027t got any home.” “Where\u0027s your father and mother?” “They are both dead.” “What are you going to do?” “I hope to get into a store or counting-room and learn to be a merchant.” “I shan\u0027t have to work for a living,” said Oscar, in a tone of importance. “Because your family is rich, I suppose,” said Herbert. “Yes, we\u0027ve got a large estate, ever so many acres. That\u0027s what mother\u0027s got. Then grandpa is rich besides, and I expect he will leave me a good deal of his money. He\u0027s pretty old, and I don\u0027t believe he\u0027ll live very long.” Oscar said this with such evident satisfaction that Herbert was disgusted, thinking it not very creditable to him to speculate so complacently upon his grandfather\u0027s speedy death. “You seem to be well off, then,” said he, at last, to the boy. “Yes,” said Oscar, “our family is one of the first in the State. My father is a Peyton.” “Is he?” asked Herbert, not appearing as much awestruck as Oscar expected. “We\u0027ve got a plantation in Virginia. We live there part of the year. My father\u0027s there now. I hope we shall go there soon.” “Do you like it better than here?” “Yes, a good deal.” “This is a handsome place.” “Yes, this is mother\u0027s estate. The other belongs to father.” “Have you any brothers and sisters, Oscar?” “I\u0027ve got one sister. She\u0027s about twelve. But, I say, I thought you were a gentleman\u0027s son when I first saw you.” “So I am,” said Herbert, emphatically. “Was your father rich?” “No.” “Did he have to work for a living?” “Yes.” “Then he wasn\u0027t a gentleman,” said Oscar, decidedly. “Isn\u0027t anybody a gentleman that has to work for a living?” asked Herbert, his indignation excited by his companion\u0027s assumption of superiority. “Of course not,” said Oscar, coolly. “It isn\u0027t respectable to work. Niggers and servants work.” “That is where I don\u0027t agree with you,” said Herbert, his face flushing. “You don\u0027t pretend to be a gentleman, do you?” demanded Oscar, insolently. “Yes, I do,” said Herbert, firmly. “But you\u0027re not one, you know.” “I don\u0027t know anything of the kind,” said Herbert, angrily. “I suppose you call yourself one.” “Of course, I am a gentleman,” said Oscar, complacently. “You don\u0027t talk like one, at any rate,” retorted Herbert. This was new language for Oscar to hear. He had been accustomed to have his own way pretty much, and had been used to order round his father\u0027s servants and slaves like a little despot. The idea of being told by a boy who had to work for a living that he did not talk like a gentleman, did not suit him at all. His black eyes flashed and he clenched his fists. “Do you mean to insult me?” he demanded. “I never insult anybody,” said Herbert, not feeling particularly alarmed by this hostile demonstration. “It is you that have insulted me.” “Didn\u0027t you tell me I was not a gentleman?” said Oscar, hotly. “I said you did not talk like one.” “That\u0027s about the same thing,” said Oscar. “Just as you like. Even if I did say so, you said the same of me.” “Well, suppose I did.” “I am as much a gentleman as you, to say the least,” asserted Herbert. “If you say that again, I\u0027ll knock you down,” said Oscar, furiously. “I\u0027ll say it all day, if I like,” said Herbert, defiantly. Perhaps it would have been better for Herbert to stop disputing, and to have taken no notice of Oscar\u0027s words. But Herbert was not perfect. He had plenty of spirit, and he was provoked by the airs Oscar chose to assume, and by no means inclined to allow him to arrogate a superiority over himself, merely on account of his wealth. Though manly and generous, he was quick to resent an insult, and accordingly, when Oscar dared to repeat what he had said, he instantly accepted the challenge as recorded above. Had Oscar been prudent, he would have hesitated before endeavoring to carry his threat into execution. A moment\u0027s glance at the two boys would have satisfied anyone that the chances, in a personal contest, were decidedly in our hero\u0027s favor. Herbert was not only a little taller than Oscar, perhaps an inch and a half, but his shoulders were broader and his frame more muscular. Oscar had never done any work to strengthen his arms, while Herbert had been forced by circumstances to do so. Oscar flung himself upon Herbert, and endeavored to bear him to the ground. But the latter, without an effort, repelled the charge, and flung himself free from his antagonist\u0027s grasp. This naturally made Oscar more determined to overcome his foe. His face red with passion, he showered blows upon Herbert, which the latter parried with ease. At first he acted wholly upon the defensive, but, finding that Oscar\u0027s impetuosity did not abate, suddenly closed with him and threw him down. Oscar rose but little hurt, for Herbert used no unnecessary force, and recommenced the assault. But the result was the same as before. Oscar was almost beside himself with mingled rage and mortification, and it is hard to tell how long the contest would have lasted, had not a servant come up and informed the boys that Mrs. Peyton wished to see them immediately. She had witnessed the whole scene from a window and felt called upon to interfere. “How is this, young gentleman?” she asked, gravely. “You have scarcely been together twenty minutes, and I find you fighting.” “I beg your pardon, Mrs. Peyton,” said Herbert, in a manly tone. “I feel ashamed of myself, but Oscar attacked me for claiming to be a gentleman, and I am afraid that my blood was up, and so we got into a fight.” “How is this, Oscar?” said his mother. “Did you so wholly lose your politeness as to attack your guest for asserting his claims to be a gentleman? I am annoyed with you.” “He says he has to work for a living,” said Oscar, sullenly. “So may you, some time.” “I am rich.” “You may not always be. At any rate, being rich doesn\u0027t insure gentlemanly behavior, as your conduct to-day clearly shows. Herbert, I hope you will excuse my son\u0027s rudeness.” “Here is my hand, Oscar,” said Herbert, cordially. “Let us be friends.” Oscar hardly knew how to receive this overture, but he was finally thawed by Herbert\u0027s manner, and they were soon sauntering about on the lawn on the best of terms. At half-past eleven, after an inviting lunch, the carriage was ordered, and Herbert and Mr. Carroll were driven to the depot, accompanied by Oscar, who went in his mother\u0027s place. Herbert purchased tickets for both, being intrusted with Mr. Carrol\u0027s pocketbook for that purpose. He found a comfortable seat for the old gentleman, and sat down beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3020/83521.html","bookId":261,"book":{"id":261,"title":"Try and Trust","description":"简介： Well, wife, said Mr. Benjamin Stanton, as he sat down to a late breakfast, I had a letter from Ohio yesterday....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3020","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
