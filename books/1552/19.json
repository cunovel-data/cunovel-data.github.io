My impression is that the airport is very busy during the day, but that there is very little traffic at night. Would it be possible that the radar is not so closely watched at night?\u0027\u0027 The Commissioner of Police, a pleasant, very military-looking man in his forties, the silver buttons and insignia on whose dark blue uniform glittered as they can only when spit and polish is a main activity and there are plenty of batmen around, said judiciously, \"I think the Commander has a point there, sir. The airport commandant admits that things do slacken off a bit when there\u0027s nothing scheduled. He hasn\u0027t got all that amount of staff and of course most of them are locals, sir. Good men, but hardly up to London Airport standards. And the radar at the met. station is only a G.C.A. set with a low horizon and range---mostly used for shipping.\u0027\u0027 “Quite, quite.\u0027\u0027 The Deputy Governor didn\u0027t want to be dragged into a discussion about radar sets or the merits of Nassavian labor. ”There\u0027s certainly a point there. No doubt Commander Bond will be making his own inquiries. Now there was a request from the Secretary of State\u0027\u0027---the title rolled sonorously forth---\"for details and comments on recent arrivals in the island, suspicious characters, and so forth. Mr. Pitman?\u0027\u0027 The Chief of Immigration and Customs was a sleek Nassavian with quick brown eyes and an ingratiating manner. He smiled pleasantly. Nothing out of the ordinary, sir. The usual mixture of tourists and businessmen and local people coming home. We were asked to have details for the past two weeks, sir.\u0027\u0027 He touched the brief case on his lap. “I have all the immigration forms here, sir. Perhaps Commander Bond would care to go through them with me.\u0027\u0027 The brown eyes flicked toward Bond and away. ”All the big hotels have house detectives. I could probably get him further details on any particular name. All Passports were checked in the normal manner. There were no irregularities and none of these people was on our Wanted List.\u0027\u0027 Bond said, \"Might I ask a question?\u0027\u0027 The Deputy Governor nodded enthusiastically. \"Of course. Of course. Anything you like. We\u0027re all here to help.\u0027\u0027 \"I\u0027m looking for a group of men. Probably ten or more. They probably stick together a good deal. Might be as many as twenty or thirty. I guess they would be Europeans. They probably have a ship or a plane. They may have been here for months or only a few days. I gather you have plenty of conventions coming to Nassau---salesmen, tourist associations, religious groups, heaven knows what all. Apparently they take a block of rooms in some hotel and hold meetings and so forth for a week or so. Is there anything like that going on at the moment?\u0027\u0027 \"Mr. Pitman?\u0027\u0027 “Well, of course we do have plenty of those sort of gatherings. Very welcome to the Tourist Board.\u0027\u0027 The Chief of Immigration smiled conspiratorially at Bond as if he had just given away a closely guarded secret. ”But in the last two weeks we\u0027ve only had a Moral Rearmament Group at the Emerald Wave and the Tiptop Biscuit people at the Royal Bahamian. They\u0027ve gone now. Quite the usual convention pattern. All very respectable.\u0027\u0027 \"That\u0027s just it, Mr. Pitman. The people I\u0027m looking for, the people who may have arranged to steal this plane, will certainly take pains to look respectable and behave in a respectable fashion. We\u0027re not looking for a bunch of flashy crooks. We think these must be very big people indeed. Now, is there anything like that on the island, a group of people like that?\u0027\u0027 “Well\u0027\u0027---the Chief of Immigration smiled broadly---”of course we\u0027ve got our annual treasure hunt going on.\u0027\u0027 The Deputy Governor barked a quick, deprecating laugh. \"Now, steady on, Mr. Pitman. Surely we don\u0027t want them to get mixed up in all this, or heaven knows where we shall end. I can\u0027t believe Commander Bond wants to bother his head over a lot of rich beachcombers.\u0027\u0027 The Commissioner of Police said doubtfully, \"The only thing is, sir---they do have a yacht, and a small plane for the matter of that. And I did hear that a lot of shareholders in the swindle had come in lately. Those points do tally with what the Commander was asking about. I admit it\u0027s ridiculous, but this man Largo\u0027s respectable enough for Commander Bond\u0027s requirements and his men have never once given us trouble. Unusual to have not even one case of drunkenness in a ship\u0027s crew in nearly six months.\u0027\u0027 And Bond had leaped at the flimsy thread and had pursued it for another two hours--- in the Customs building and in the Commissioner\u0027s office--- and, as a result, he had gone walking in the town to see if he could get a look at Largo or any of his party or pick up any other shreds of gossip. As a result he had got a good look at Domino Vitali. And now? The taxi had arrived at the airport. Bond told the driver to wait and walked into the long low entrance hall just as the arrival of Larkin\u0027s flight was being announced over the Tannoy. He knew there would be the usual delay for customs and immigration. He went to the souvenir shop and bought a copy of the New York Times . In its usual discreet headlines it was still leading with the loss of the Vindicator. Perhaps it knew also about the loss of the atom bombs, because Arthur Krock, on the editorial page, had a heavyweight column about the security aspects of the NATO alliance. Bond was halfway through this when a quiet voice in his ear said, \"007? Meet No. 000.\u0027\u0027 Bond swung round. It was! It was Felix Leiter! Leiter, his C.I.A. companion on some of the most thrilling cases in Bond\u0027s career, grinned and thrust the steel hook that was his right hand under Bond\u0027s arm. \"Take it easy, friend. Dick Tracy will tell all when we get out of here. Bags are out front. Let\u0027s go.\u0027\u0027 Bond said, \"Well God damn it! You old so-and-so! Did you know it was going to be me?\u0027\u0027 \"Sure. C.I.A. knows all.\u0027\u0027 At the entrance Leiter had his luggage, which was considerable, put aboard Bond\u0027s taxi, and told the driver to take it to the Royal Bahamian. A man standing beside an undistinguished-looking black Ford Consul sedan left the car and came up. \"Mr. Larkin? I\u0027m from the Hertz company. This is the car you ordered. We hope she\u0027s what you want. You did specify something conventional.\u0027\u0027 Leiter glanced casually at the car. \"Looks all right. I just want a car that\u0027ll go. None of those ritzy jobs with only room for a small blonde with a sponge bag. I\u0027m here to do property work--- not jazz it up. \"May I see your New York license, sir? Right. Then if you\u0027ll just sign here . . . and I\u0027ll make a note of the number of your Diner\u0027s Club card. When you go, leave the car anywhere you like and just notify us. We\u0027ll collect it. Have a good holiday, sir.\u0027\u0027 They got into the car. Bond took the wheel. Leiter said that he\u0027d have to practice a bit on what he called \"this Limey southpaw routine\u0027\u0027 of driving on the left, and anyway he\u0027d be interested to see if Bond had improved his cornering since their last drive together. When they were out of the airport Bond said, \"Now go ahead and tell. Last time we met you were with Pinkertons. What\u0027s the score?\u0027\u0027 \"Drafted. Just damned well drafted. Hell, anyone would think there was a war on. You see, James, once you\u0027ve worked for C.I.A., you\u0027re automatically put on the reserve of officers when you leave. Unless you\u0027ve been cashiered for not eating the code book under fire or something. And apparently my old Chief, Alien Dulles that is, just didn\u0027t have the men to go round when the President sounded the fire alarm. So I and twenty or so other guys were just pulled in---drop everything, twenty-four hours to report. Hell! I thought the Russians had landed! And then they tell me the score and to pack my bathing trunks and my spade and bucket and come on down to Nassau. So of course I griped like hell. Asked them if I shouldn\u0027t brush up on my Canasta game and take some quick lessons in the cha-cha. So then they unbuttoned and told me I was to team up with you down here and I thought maybe if that old bastard of yours, N or M or whatever you call him, had sent you down here with your old equalizer, there might be something cooking in the pot after all. So I picked up the gear you\u0027d asked for from Admin., packed the bow and arrows instead of the spade and bucket, and here I am. And that\u0027s that. Now you tell, you old sonofabitch. Hell, it\u0027s good to see you.\u0027\u0027 Bond took Leiter through the whole story, point by point from the moment he had been summoned to M\u0027s office the morning before. When he came to the shooting outside his headquarters, Leiter stopped him. \"Now what do you make of that, James? In my book that\u0027s a pretty funny coincidence. Have you been fooling around with anybody\u0027s wife lately? Sounds more like around the Loop in Chicago than a mile or so from Piccadilly.\u0027\u0027 Bond said seriously, “It makes no sense to me, and none to anyone else. The only man who might have had it in for me, recently that is, is a crazy bastard I met down at a sort of clinic place I had to go to on some blasted medical grounds.\u0027\u0027 Bond, to Leiter\u0027s keen pleasure, rather sheepishly gave details of his ”cure\u0027\u0027 at Shrublands. “I bowled this man out as a member of a Chinese Tong, one of their secret societies, the Red Lightning Tong. He must have heard me getting the gen on his outfit from Records---on an open line from a call box in the place. Next thing, he damned near managed to murder me. Just for a lark, and to get even, I did my best to roast him alive.\u0027\u0027 Bond gave the details. ”Nice quiet place, Shrublands. You\u0027d be surprised how carrot juice seems to affect people.\u0027\u0027 \"Where was this lunatic asylum?\u0027\u0027 \"Place called Washington. Modest little place compared with yours. Not far from Brighton.\u0027\u0027 “And the letter was posted from Brighton.\u0027\u0027 ”That\u0027s the hell of a long shot.\u0027\u0027 \"I\u0027ll try another. One of the points our chaps brought up was that if a plane was to be stolen at night and landed at night, a full moon would be the hell of an aid to the job. But the plane was taken five days after the full. Just supposing your roast chicken was the letter-sender. And supposing the roasting forced him to delay sending the letter while he recovered. His employers would be pretty angry. Yes?\u0027\u0027 \"I suppose so.\u0027\u0027 \"And supposing they gave orders for him to be rubbed for inefficiency. And supposing the killer got to him just as he got to you to settle his private account. From what you tell me he wouldn\u0027t have lain down under what you did to him. Well, now. Just supposing all that. It adds up, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\u0027 Bond laughed, partly in admiration. \"You\u0027ve been taking mescalin or something. It\u0027s a damned good sequence for a comic strip, but these things don\u0027t happen in real life.\u0027\u0027 \"Planes with atom bombs don\u0027t get stolen in real life. Except that they do. You\u0027re slowing down, James. How many people would believe the files on some of the cases you and I have got mixed up in? Don\u0027t give me that crap about real life. There ain\u0027t no such animal.\u0027\u0027 Bond said seriously, \"Well, look here, Felix. Tell you what I\u0027ll do. There\u0027s just enough sense in your story, so I\u0027ll put it on the machine to M tonight and see if the Yard can get anywhere with it. They could check with the clinic and the hospital in Brighton, if that\u0027s where he was taken, and they may be able to get on from there. Trouble is, wherever they get, there\u0027s nothing left of the man but his shoes, and I doubt if they\u0027ll catch up with the man on the motorbike. It looked a real pro job to me.\u0027\u0027 \"Why not? These highjackers sound like pros. It\u0027s a pro plan. It all fits all right. You go ahead and put it on the wire and don\u0027t be ashamed of saying it was my idea. My medal collection has got to looking a bit thin since I left the outfit.\u0027\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-19.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \"The girl looked him up and down.
