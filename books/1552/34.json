{"id":107890,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"Largo said softly, \"And what is it you propose, No. 10?\u0027\u0027 For the first time, No. 10 looked to his right. He could not see the expression in Largo\u0027s eye. He spoke at the great red and black mass of his face. The tone of his voice was obstinate. He said, \"I am proposing that one member of each national group should stay on board to safeguard the interests of the other members of his national group. That would reduce the swimming party to ten. In this way those who are undertaking this dangerous work would go about it with more enthusiasm knowing that no such happening as I have mentioned could come about.\u0027\u0027 Largo\u0027s voice was polite, unemotional. He said, \"I have one very short and simple answer to your suggestion, No. 10.\u0027\u0027 The light glittered redly on the metal thumb that protruded from the big hand. The three bullets pumped so quickly into the face of the Russian that the three explosions, the three bright flashes, were almost one. No. 10 put up two feeble hands, palms forward, as if to catch any further bullets, gave a jerk forward with his stomach at the edge of the table, and then crashed heavily backward, in a splinter of chair wood, onto the floor. Largo put the muzzle of the gun up to his nose and delicately sniffed at it, moving it to and fro under the nostrils as if it was some delicious phial of perfume. In the silence, he looked slowly down one rank of faces and up the other. Finally he said softly, \"The meeting is now at an end. Will all members please return to their cabins and look for a last time to their equipment. Food will be ready from now on in the galley. One drink of alcohol will also be available for those who want it. I will detail two crew members to look after the late No. 10. Thank you.\u0027\u0027 When Largo was alone he got to his feet, stretched, and gave a great cavernous yawn. Then he turned to the sideboard, opened a drawer and took out a box of Corona cigars. He chose one and, with a gesture of distaste, lit it. He then took the closed red rubber container that held the ice cubes and walked out of the door and along to the cabin of Domino Vitali. He closed the door and locked it. Here also, a red riding light hung from the ceiling. Under it, on the double bunk, the girl lay offered like a starfish, her ankles and wrists strapped to the four corners of the ironwork below the mattress. Largo put the icebox down on the chest of drawers and balanced the cigar carefully beside it so that the glowing tip would not spoil the varnish. The girl watched him, her eyes glittering red points in the semi-darkness. Largo said, “My dear, I have had great enjoyment out of your body, much pleasure. In return, unless you tell me who gave you that machine to bring on board, I shall be forced to cause you great pain. It will be caused with these two simple instruments,\u0027\u0027 he held up the cigar and blew on the tip until it glowed brightly, ”this for heat, and these ice cubes for cold. Applied scientifically, as I shall apply them, they will have the inevitable effect of causing your voice, when it has stopped screaming, to speak, and speak the truth. Now then. Which is it to be?\u0027\u0027 The girl\u0027s voice was deadly with hate. She said, \"You killed my brother and you will now kill me. Go on and enjoy yourself. You are already a piece of death yourself. When the rest of it comes, very soon, I pray God you will suffer a million times more than both of us.\u0027\u0027 Largo\u0027s laugh was a short, harsh bark. He walked over to the edge of the bunk. He said, \"Very well, my dear. We must see what we can do with you, very softly and very, very slowly.\u0027\u0027 He bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her shirt and the join of the brassiere. Very slowly, but with great force, he tore downward, the whole length of her. Then he threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole gleaming length of her body. He examined it carefully and reflectively and then went to the chest of drawers and took the cigar and the bowl of ice cubes and came back and made himself comfortable on the edge of the bunk. Then he took a puff at the cigar, knocked the ash off onto the floor, and leaned forward. 22. The Shadower In the attack center of the Manta it was very quiet. Commander Pedersen, standing behind the man at the echo-sounder, occasionally made a comment over his shoulder to Bond and Leiter, who had been given canvas-backed chairs well away from the depth and speed gauges, which had been hooded so that they could be read only by the navigating team. These three men sat side by side on red leather, foam-cushioned, aluminum seats, handling the rudder and the forward and aft diving planes as if they were pilots in an airliner. Now the captain left the echo-sounder and came over to Bond and Leiter. He smiled cheerfully. “Thirty fathoms and the nearest cay is a mile to westwards. Now we\u0027ve got a clear course all the way to Grand Bahama. And we\u0027re making good speed. If we keep it up, we\u0027ve got about four hours\u0027 sailing. Be off Grand Bahama about an hour before first light. How about some food and a bit of sleep? There won\u0027t be anything on the radar for an hour---these Berry Islands\u002711 fill the screen until we\u0027re clear of them. Then\u002711 come the big question. When we clear them, shall we see that one of the smallest of the cays has broken loose and is sailing fast northwards on a parallel course to ours? If we see that on the screen, it\u0027ll be the Disco. If she\u0027s there, we\u0027ll submerge. You\u0027ll hear the alarm bells. But you can just roll over and have a bit more sleep. Nothing can happen until it\u0027s certain that she\u0027s in the target area. Then we\u0027ll have to think again.\u0027\u0027 The captain made for the stairway. ”Mind if I lead the way? Watch your head on the pipes. This is the one part of the ship where there isn\u0027t much clearance.\u0027\u0027 They followed him down and along a passage to the mess hall, a well-lighted dining room finished in cream with pastel pink and green panels. They took their places at the head of one of the Formica-top tables away from the other officers and men, who looked curiously at the two civilians. The captain waved a hand at the walls of the room. “Bit of a change from the old battleship gray. You\u0027d be surprised how many eggheads are involved in the design of these ships. Have to be, if you want to keep your crew happy when the ship\u0027s submerged for a month or more at a time. The trick-cyclists said We couldn\u0027t have just one color, must have contrast everywhere or the men\u0027s eyes get sort of depressed. This hall\u0027s used for movies, closed-circuit television, cribbage tournaments, bingo, God knows what---anything to keep the men off duty from getting bored. And you notice there\u0027s no smell of cooking or engine smells. Electrostatic precipitators all over the ship that filter them off.\u0027\u0027 A steward came with menus. ”Now then, let\u0027s get down to it. I\u0027m having the baked Virginia ham with red-eye gravy, apple pie with ice cream, and iced coffee. And steward, don\u0027t go too easy on that red-eye.\u0027\u0027 He turned to Bond. \"Getting out of harbor always gives me an appetite. You know, it isn\u0027t the sea the captain hates, it\u0027s the land.\u0027\u0027 Bond ordered poached eggs with rye toast and coffee. He was grateful for the captain\u0027s cheerful talk, but he himself had no appetite. There was a gnawing tension inside him which would be released only when the Disco was picked up on the radar and there would be a prospect of action. And lurking behind his concern about the whole operation was worry about the girl. Had he been right to trust her with so much of the truth? Had she betrayed him? Had she been caught? Was she alive? He drank down a glass of iced water, and listened to the captain explaining how the ice cubes and the water were distilled from the sea. Finally Bond became impatient with the cheerful, even tone of the conversation. He said, \"Forgive me, Captain, but could I interrupt for a moment and clear my mind about what we\u0027re going to do if we\u0027re right about the Disco and if we come up with her off the Grand Bahama? I can\u0027t quite figure what the next step ought to be. I\u0027ve got my own ideas, but were you thinking we\u0027d try and go alongside and board her, or just blow her out of the water?\u0027\u0027 The captain\u0027s gray eyes were quizzical. He said, “I was kind of leaving all that to you fellers. The Navy Department says that I\u0027m under your orders. I\u0027m just the chauffeur. Supposing you tell me what you have in mind and I\u0027ll be glad to go along with anything you suggest so long as it doesn\u0027t endanger my ship\u0027\u0027---he smiled---”too much, that is. In the last resort, if the Navy Department means what it says, and from your account of this operation it does, the safety of the ship will also have to go by the board. As I told you aloft in the attack center, I got acknowledgment of our signal and full approval for our proposed course of action. That\u0027s all the clearance I need. Now then, you tell me.\u0027\u0027 The food came. Bond pecked at his eggs and pushed them away. He lit a cigarette. He said, looking at Felix Leiter, “Well, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve worked out, Felix, but this is how I see the picture we may find around four o\u0027clock in the morning, on the assumption, that is, that the Disco has been sailing north in shoal water under cover of the Berry Islands and that she\u0027ll then make for the Grand Bahama shore somewhere off the site of the missile station. Well now, on that assumption, I\u0027ve had a good look at the charts and it seems to me that, if she\u0027s going to lay that bomb as close to the target as she can, she\u0027ll heave to and anchor about a mile offshore in about ten fathoms and get the bomb another half-mile or so closer to the target, lay it in twelve feet of water or so, switch on the time mechanism, and get the hell away. That\u0027s how I\u0027d go about it. She\u0027d be away by first light and there\u0027s plenty of yacht traffic around West End from what I can gather from the pilot. She\u0027d show up on the station radar, of course, but she\u0027d be just another yacht. Assuming the bomb\u0027s set for the twelve hours Largo\u0027s got before the time limit expires, he could be back in Nassau or twice as far away if he wanted in the time he\u0027s got. For my money, he\u0027ll go back to Nassau with his treasure-hunting story and wait for the next lot of orders from SPECTRE.\u0027\u0027 Bond paused. He avoided Leiter\u0027s eyes. ”That is, unless he\u0027s managed to get information out of the girl.\u0027\u0027 Leiter said stanchly, \"Hell, I don\u0027t believe that girl would talk. She\u0027s a tough cookie. And supposing she did? He\u0027s only got to drop her overboard with some lead round her neck and say her aqualung failed on the treasure hunt, or some spiel of that sort. He\u0027d go back to Nassau all right. That man\u0027s cover\u0027s as solid as J. P. Morgan and Company.\u0027\u0027 The captain interrupted. \"Leaving all that aside, Commander Bond, and sticking to the operational angles, how do you suggest he\u0027s going to get that bomb out of the ship and right into the target area? I agree that according to the charts he can\u0027t get much closer in the yacht, and if he did he might be in trouble with the waterfront guard at the missile station. I see from my dope on the place that they\u0027ve got some kind of a guard boat for chasing away fishermen and suchlike when they\u0027re going to do a practice shoot.\u0027\u0027 Bond said decisively, \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s the real purpose of the underwater compartment in the Disco . They\u0027ve got one of those underwater sleds in there, and probably an electric torpedo to haul it. They\u0027ll load the bomb on the sled and take it in with a team of underwater swimmers, lay it, and come back to the ship. Otherwise, why have all that underwater gear?\u0027\u0027 The captain said slowly, \"You may be right, Commander. It makes sense. But so what do you want me to do about it?\u0027\u0027 Bond looked the captain in the eye. \"There\u0027s only one moment to nail these people. If we show our hand too soon, the Disco can get the hell away---only a few hundred yards maybe, and dump the bombs in a hundred fathoms. The only time to get them, and the bomb, the first bomb anyway, is when that team has left the ship and is on its way to the laying point. We\u0027ve got to get their underwater team with our underwater team. The second bomb, if it\u0027s aboard, doesn\u0027t matter. We can sink the ship with the second bomb inside her.\u0027\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-34.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \"The girl looked him up and down.
