{"id":107878,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Back in the hotel, a dispatch rider from Government House was waiting for Bond. He saluted smartly, handed over an O.H.M.S. envelope, and got Bond\u0027s signed receipt in exchange. It was a cable from the Colonial Office “Personal to the Governor.\u0027\u0027 The text was prefixed PROBOND. The cable read: ”YOUR 1107 RECORDS HAVE NOTHING REPEAT NOTHING ON THESE NAMES STOP INFORMATIVELY ALL STATIONS REPORT NEGATIVELY ON OPERATION THUNDERBALL STOP WHAT HAVE you QUERY.\u0027\u0027 The message was signed \"PRISM,\u0027\u0027 which meant that M had approved it.\n Bond handed the cable to Leiter.\n Leiter read it. He said, \"See what I mean? We\u0027re on a bum steer. This is a thumb-twiddler. See you later in the Pineapple Bar for a dry martini that\u0027s half a jumbo olive. I\u0027ll go send a postcard to Washington and asked them to send down a couple of WAVES. We\u0027re going to have time on our hands.\u0027\u0027\n 14.\n Sour Martinis\n As it turned out, the first half of Bond\u0027s program for the evening went by the board. On the telephone Domino Vitali said that it would not be convenient for them to see the house that evening. Her guardian and some of his friends were coming ashore. Yet it was indeed possible that they might meet at the Casino that evening. She would be dining on board and the Disco would then sail round and anchor off the Casino. But how would she be able to recognize him in the Casino? She had a very poor memory for faces. Would he perhaps wear a flower in his buttonhole or something?\n Bond had laughed. He said that would be all right. He would remember her by her beautiful blue eyes. They were unforgettable. And the blue rinse that matched them. He had put the receiver down halfway through the amused, sexy chuckle. He suddenly wanted to see her again very much.\n But the movement of the ship altered his plans for the better. It would be much easier to reconnoitre her in the harbor. It would be a shorter swim and he would be able to go into the water under cover of the harbor police wharf. Equally, with her anchorage empty, it would be all the easier to survey the area where she had been lying. But if Largo moved the yacht about so nonchalantly was it likely the bombs, if there were any, would be hidden at the anchorage? If they were, surely the Disco would stand watch over them. Bond decided to put a decision aside until he had more and more expert information about the ship\u0027s hull.\n He sat in his room and wrote his negative report to M. He read it through. It would be a depressing signal to get. Should he say anything about the wisp of a lead he was working on? No. Not until he had something solid. Wishful intelligence, the desire to please or reassure the recipient, was the most dangerous commodity in the whole realm of secret information. Bond could imagine the reaction in Whitehall where the Thunderball war room would be ready, anxious to grasp at straws. M\u0027s careful “I think we may conceivably have got a lead in the Bahamas. Absolutely nothing definite, but this particular man doesn\u0027t often go wrong on these things. Yes, certainly I\u0027ll check back and see if we can get a follow-up.\u0027\u0027 And the buzz would get around: ”M\u0027s on to something. Agent of his thinks he\u0027s got a lead. The Bahamas. Yes, I think we\u0027d better tell the P.M.\u0027\u0027 Bond shuddered. The MOST IMMEDIATES would pour in to him: “Elucidate your 1806.\u0027\u0027 ”Flash fullest details.\u0027\u0027 “Premier wants detailed grounds for your 1806.\u0027\u0027 There would be no end to the flood. Leiter would get the same from C.I.A. The whole place would be in an uproar. Then, in answer to Bond\u0027s tatty little fragments of gossip and speculation, there would come the blistering: ”Surprised you should take this flimsy evidence seriously.\u0027\u0027 “Futurely confine your signals to facts,\u0027\u0027 and, the final degradation, ”View speculative nature your 1806 and subsequents comma future signals must repeat must be joint and countersigned by CIA representative.\u0027\u0027\n Bond wiped his forehead. He unlocked the case containing his cipher machine, transposed his text, checked it again, and went off to Police Headquarters, where Leiter was sitting at his keyboard, the sweat of concentration pouring down his neck. Ten minutes later Leiter took off his earphones and handed over to Bond. He mopped his face with an already drenched handkerchief. “First it\u0027s sunspots, and I had to swap over to the emergency wavelength. There I found they\u0027d put a baboon on the other end---you know, one of the ones that can write the whole of Shakespeare if you leave him at it long enough.\u0027\u0027 He angrily waved several pages of cipher groups. ”Now I\u0027ve got to unscramble all this. Probably from Accounts about how much extra income tax this sunshine trip will cost me.\u0027\u0027 He sat down at a table and began cranking away at his machine.\n Bond put his short message over quickly. He could see it being punched out on the tapes in one of those busy rooms on the eighth floor, going to the supervisor, being marked \"Personal for M, copy to OO Section and Records,\u0027\u0027 then another girl hurrying off down the passage with the flimsy yellow forms on a clip file. He queried whether there was anything for him and signed off. He left Leiter and went down to the Commissioner\u0027s room.\n Harling was sitting at his desk with his coat off, dictating to a police sergeant. He dismissed him, pushed a box of cigarettes over his desk to Bond, and lit one himself. He smiled quizzically. \"Any progress?\u0027\u0027\n Bond told him that the Trace on the Largo group had been negative and that they had called on Largo and gone over the Disco with a Geiger counter. This also had been negative. Bond still wasn\u0027t satisfied. He told the Commissioner what he wanted to know about the fuel capacity of the Disco and the exact location of the fuel tanks. The Commissioner nodded amiably and picked up the telephone. He asked for a Sergeant Molony of the Harbor Police. He cradled the receiver and explained, “We check all fueling. This is a narrow harbor crammed with small craft, deep-sea fishing boats, and so on. Quite a fire hazard if something went wrong. We like to know what everyone is carrying and whereabouts in the ship. Just in case there\u0027s some fire-fighting to be done or we want a particular ship to get out of range in a hurry.\u0027\u0027 He went back to the telephone. ”Sergeant Molony?\u0027\u0027 He repeated Bond\u0027s questions, listened, said thank-you, and put the receiver down. \"She carries a maximum of five hundred gallons of Diesel. Took that amount on on the afternoon of June 2nd. She also carries about forty gallons of lubricating oil and a hundred gallons of drinking water---all carried amidships just forrard of the engine room. That what you want?\u0027\u0027\n This made nonsense of Largo\u0027s talk of lateral tanks and the difficult ballast problem and so forth. Of course he could have wanted to keep some secret treasure-hunting gear out of sight of the visitors, but at least there was something on board he wanted to hide, and, for all his show of openness, it was now established that Mr. Largo might be a rich treasure hunter, but he was also an unreliable witness. Now Bond\u0027s mind was made up. It was the hull of the ship he wanted to have a look at. Leiter\u0027s mention of the Olterra had been a long shot, but it just might pay off.\n Bond passed on a guarded version of his thoughts to the Commissioner. He told him where the Disco would be lying that night. Was there on the force a totally reliable man who could give him a hand with his underwater recce, and was there a sound aqualung, fully charged, available?\n Harling gently asked if this was wise. He didn\u0027t exactly know the laws of trespass, but these seemed to be good citizens and they were certainly good spenders. Largo was very popular with everyone. Any kind of scandal, particularly if the police were involved, would create the hell of a stink in the Colony.\n Bond said firmly, “I\u0027m sorry, Commissioner. I quite see your point. But these risks have to be run and I\u0027ve got a job to do. Surely the Secretary of State\u0027s instructions are sufficient authority,\u0027\u0027 Bond fired his broadside. ”I could get specific orders from him, or from the Prime Minister for the matter of that, in about an hour if you feel it\u0027s necessary.\u0027\u0027\n The Commissioner shook his head. He smiled. \"No need to use the big guns, Commander. Of course you shall have what you want. I was just giving you the local reaction. I\u0027m sure the Governor would have given you the same warning. This is a small puddle here. We\u0027re not used to the crash treatment from Whitehall. No doubt we\u0027ll get used to it if this flap last long enough. Now then. Yes, we\u0027ve got plenty of what you want. We\u0027ve got twenty men in the Harbor Salvage Unit. Have to. You\u0027d be surprised how often a small boat gets wrecked in the fairway, just where some cruise ship\u0027s going to anchor. And of course there\u0027s the occasional body. I\u0027ll have Constable Santos assigned to you. Splendid chap. Native of Eleuthera, where he used to win all the swimming prizes. He\u0027ll have the gear you want where you want it. Now just give me the details. . . .\u0027\u0027\n Back in his hotel, Bond took a shower, swallowed a double bourbon old-fashioned, and threw himself down on his bed. He felt absolutely beat---the plane trip, the heat, the nagging sense that he was making a fool of himself in front of the Commissioner, in front of Leiter, in front of himself, added to the dangers, and probably futile ones at that, of this ugly night swim, had built up tensions that could only be eased by sleep and solitude. He went out like a light---to dream of Domino being pursued by a shark with dazzling white teeth that suddenly became Largo, Largo who turned on him with those huge hands. They were coming closer, they reached slowly for him, they had him by the shoulder. . . . But then the bell rang for the end of the round, and went on ringing.\n Bond reached out a drugged hand for the receiver. It was Leiter. He wanted that martini with the jumbo olive. It was nine o\u0027clock. What the hell was Bond doing? Did he want someone to help with the zipper?\n The Pineapple Room was paneled in bamboo carefully varnished against termites. Wrought-iron pineapples on the tables and against the wall contained segments of thick red candle, and more light was provided by illuminated aquaria let into the walls and by ceiling lights enclosed in pink glass starfish. The Vinylite banquettes were in ivory white and the barman and the two waiters wore scarlet satin calypso shirts with their black trousers.\n Bond joined Leiter at a corner table. They both wore white dinner jackets with their dress trousers. Bond had pointed up his rich, property-seeking status with a wine-red cummerbund. Leiter laughed. \"I nearly tied a gold-plated bicycle chain round my waist in case of trouble, but I remembered just in time that I\u0027m a peaceful lawyer. I suppose it\u0027s right that you should get the girls on this assignment. I suppose I just stand by and arrange the marriage settlement and later the alimony. Waiter!\u0027\u0027\n Leiter ordered two dry martinis. “Just watch,\u0027\u0027 he said sourly. The martinis arrived. Leiter took one look at them and told the waiter to send over the barman. When the barman came, looking resentful, Leiter said, ”My friend, I asked for a martini and not a soused olive.\u0027\u0027 He picked the olive out of the glass with the cocktail stick. The glass, that had been three-quarters full, was now half full. Leiter said mildly, \"This was being done to me while the only drink you knew was milk. I\u0027d learned the basic economics of your business by the time you\u0027d graduated to Coca-Cola. One bottle of Gordon\u0027s gin contains sixteen true measures---double measures, that is, the only ones I drink. Cut the gin with three ounces of water and that makes it up to twenty-two. Have a jigger glass with a big steal in the bottom and a bottle of these fat olives and you\u0027ve got around twenty-eight measures. Bottle of gin here costs only two dollars retail, let\u0027s say around a dollar sixty wholesale. You charge eighty cents for a martini, a dollar sixty for two. Same price as a whole bottle of gin. And with your twenty-eight measures to the bottle, you\u0027ve still got twenty-six left. That\u0027s a clear profit on one bottle of gin of around twenty-one dollars. Give you a dollar for the olives and the drop of vermouth and you\u0027ve still got twenty dollars in your pocket. Now, my friend, that\u0027s too much profit, and if I could be bothered to take this martini to the management and then to the Tourist Board, you\u0027d be in trouble. Be a good chap and mix us two large dry martinis without olives and with some slices of lemon peel separate. Okay? Right, then we\u0027re friends again.\u0027\u0027\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-22.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \n \"The girl looked him up and down.
