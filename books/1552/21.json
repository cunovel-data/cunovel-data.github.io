I wouldn\u0027t advise any client of mine to invest at these prices.\u0027\u0027 “Quite so.\u0027\u0027 Largo obviously didn\u0027t want to get drawn too deeply into these matters. ”You mentioned something about Palmyra. Is there anything I can do to help in that respect?\u0027\u0027 Bond said, “I understand you have a lease of the property, Mr. Largo. And there is talk that you may be leaving the house before long. Only gossip, of course. You know what they are in these small islands. But it sounds more or less what I\u0027m looking for and I gather the owner, this Englishman, Bryce, might sell if he got the right price. What I was going to ask you\u0027\u0027---Bond looked apologetic---”was whether we might drive out and look the place over. Some time when you weren\u0027t there of course. Any time that might suit you.\u0027\u0027 Largo flashed his teeth warmly. He spread his hands. \"But of course, of course, my dear fellow. Whenever you wish. There is no one in residence but my niece and a few servants. And she is out most of the time. Please just call her up on the telephone. I shall tell her that you will be doing so. It is indeed a charming property---so imaginative. A beautiful piece of design. If only all rich men had such good taste.\u0027\u0027 Bond got to his feet and Leiter followed suit. “Well, that\u0027s extraordinarily kind of you, Mr. Largo. And now we\u0027ll leave you in peace. Perhaps we may meet again in the town some time. You must come and have lunch. But\u0027\u0027---Bond poured admiration and flattery into his voice---”with a yacht like this, I don\u0027t suppose you ever want to come ashore. Must be the only one on this side of the Atlantic. Didn\u0027t one used to run between Venice and Trieste? I seem to remember reading about it somewhere.\u0027\u0027 Largo grinned his pleasure. \"Yes, that is right, quite right. They are also on the Italian lakes. For passenger traffic. Now they are buying them in South America. A wonderful design for coastal waters. She only draws four feet when the hydrofoil is operating.\u0027\u0027 \"I suppose accommodation\u0027s the problem?\u0027\u0027 It is a weakness of all men, though not necessarily of all women, to love their material possessions. Largo said, with a trace of pricked vanity, “No, no. I think you will find that it is not so. You can spare five minutes? We are rather crowded at the moment. You have heard no doubt of our treasure hunt?\u0027\u0027 He looked sharply at them as a man would who expects ridicule. ”But we will not discuss that now. No doubt you do not believe in these things. But my associates in the affair are all on board. With the crew, there are forty of us. You will see that we are not cramped. You would like?\u0027\u0027 Largo gestured to the door in the rear of the stateroom. Felix Leiter showed reluctance. \"You know, Mr. Bond, that we have that meeting with Mr. Harold Christie at five o\u0027clock?\u0027\u0027 Bond waved the objection aside. \"Mr. Christie is a charming man. I know he won\u0027t mind if we are a few minutes late. I\u0027d love to see over the ship if you\u0027re sure you can spare the time, Mr. Largo.\u0027\u0027 Largo said, \"Come. It will not take more than a few minutes. The excellent Mr. Christie is a friend of mine. He will understand.\u0027\u0027 He went to the door and held it open. Bond had been expecting the politeness. It would interfere with Leiter and his apparatus. He said firmly, \"Please go first, Mr. Largo. You will be able to tell us when to duck our heads.\u0027\u0027 With more affabilities, Largo led the way. Ships, however modern, are more or less the same---the corridors to port and starboard of the engine room, rows of cabin doors, which Largo explained were occupied, the large communal bathrooms, the galley, where two cheerful-looking Italians in white smocks laughed at Largo\u0027s jokes.about the food and seemed pleased with the visitors\u0027 interest, the huge engine room where the chief engineer and his mate, Germans it seemed, gave enthusiastic information about the powerful twin Diesels and explained the hydraulics of the hydrofoil depressor ---it was all exactly like visiting any other ship and saying the right things to the crew, using the right superlatives to the owner. The short space of afterdeck was occupied by the little two-seater amphibian, painted dark blue and white to match the yacht, its wings now folded and its engine cowled against the sun, a big jolly-boat to hold about twenty men, and an electric derrick to hoist them in- and outboard. Bond, estimating the ship\u0027s displacement and her freeboard, said casually, \"And the hold? More cabin space?\u0027\u0027 “Just storage. And the fuel tanks, of course. She is an expensive ship to run. We have to carry several tons. The ballast problem is important with these ships. When her bows come up, the fuel shifts aft. We have to have big lateral tanks to correct these things.\u0027\u0027 Talking fluently and expertly, Largo led them back up the starboard passageway. They were about to pass the radio room when Bond said, ”You said you had ship-to-shore. What else do you carry? The usual Marconi short and long wave, I suppose. Could I have a look? Radio has always fascinated me.\u0027\u0027 Largo said politely, \"Some other time, if you don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m keeping the operator full time on met. reports. They\u0027re rather important to us at the moment.\u0027\u0027 \"Of course.\u0027\u0027 They climbed up into the enclosed dome of the bridge, where Largo briefly explained the controls and led them out on the narrow deck space. “So there you are,\u0027\u0027 said Largo. ”The good ship Disco Volante ---the Flying Saucer. And she really does fly, I can assure you. I hope you and Mr. Larkin will come for a short cruise one of these days. For the present\u0027\u0027---he smiled with a hint of a secret shared--- \"as you may have heard, we are rather busy.\u0027\u0027 \"Very exciting, this treasure business. Do you think you\u0027ve got a good chance?\u0027\u0027 “We like to think so.\u0027\u0027 Largo was deprecating. ”I only wish I could tell you more.\u0027\u0027 He waved an apologetic hand. \"Unfortunately, as they say, my lips are sealed. I hope you will understand.\u0027\u0027 \"Yes, of course. You have your shareholders to consider. I only wish I was one so that I could come along. I suppose there\u0027s not room for another investor?\u0027\u0027 “Alas, no. The issue, as they say, is fully subscribed. It would have been very pleasant to have had you with us.\u0027\u0027 Largo held out a hand. ”Well, I see that Mr. Larkin has been looking anxiously at his watch during our brief tour. We must not keep Mr. Christie waiting any longer. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bond. And you, Mr. Larkin.\u0027\u0027 With a further exchange of courtesies they went down the ladder to the waiting launch and got under way. There was a last wave from Mr. Largo before he vanished through the hatch to the bridge. They sat in the stern well away from the boatman. Leiter shook his head. \"Absolutely negative. Reaction around the engine room and the radio room, but that\u0027s normal. It was all normal, damnably normal. What did you make of him and the whole setup?\u0027\u0027 \"Same as you---damned normal. He looks what he says he is, and behaves that way. Not much crew about, but the ones we saw were either ordinary crew or wonderful actors. Only two small things stuck me. There was no way down to the hold that I could see, but of course it could have been a manhole under the passage carpet. But then how do you get the stores he talked of down there? And there\u0027s the hell of a lot of space in that hold even if I don\u0027t know much about naval architecture. I\u0027ll do a check with the oiling wharf through the customs people and see just how much fuel he does carry. Then it\u0027s odd that we didn\u0027t see any of these shareholders. It was around three o\u0027clock when we went on board and most of them may have been having siestas. But surely not all nineteen of them. What do they do in their cabins all the time? Another small thing. Did you notice that Largo didn\u0027t smoke and that there was no trace of tobacco smell anywhere in the ship? That\u0027s odd. Around forty men and not one of them is a smoker. If one had anything else to go on one would say that wasn\u0027t coincidence but discipline. The real pros don\u0027t drink or smoke. But I admit it\u0027s a damned long shot. Notice the Decca Navigator and the echo-sounder? Pretty expensive bits of equipment, both of them. Fairly normal on a big yacht, of course, but I\u0027d have expected Largo to point them out when he was showing us the bridge. Rich men are proud of their toys. But that\u0027s only clutching at straws. I\u0027d have said the whole outfit\u0027s as clean as a whistle if it wasn\u0027t for all that missing space we weren\u0027t shown. That talk about fuel and ballast sounded a bit glib to me. What do you think?\u0027\u0027 \"Same as you. There\u0027s at least half of that ship we didn\u0027t see. But then again there\u0027s a perfectly good answer to that. He may have got a stack of secret treasure-hunting gear down there he doesn\u0027t want anyone to see. Remember that merchant ship off Gibraltar during the war? The Italian frogmen used it as a base. Big sort of trapdoor affair cut in the hull below the water line. I suppose he hasn\u0027t got something like that?\u0027\u0027 Bond looked sharply at Leiter. “The Olterra . One of the blackest marks against Intelligence during the whole war.\u0027\u0027 He paused. ”The Disco was anchored in about forty feet of water. Supposing they\u0027d got the bombs buried in the sand below her. Would your Geiger counter have registered?\u0027\u0027 “Doubt it. I\u0027ve got an underwater model and we could go and have a sniff round when it gets dark. But really, James\u0027\u0027---Leiter frowned impatiently---”aren\u0027t we getting a bit off beam---seeing burglars under the bed? We\u0027ve got damn-all to go on. Largo\u0027s a powerful-looking piratical sort of chap, probably a bit of a crook where women are concerned. But what the hell have we got against him? Have you put a Trace through on him and on these shareholders and the crew members?\u0027\u0027 “Yes. Put them all on the wire from Government House, Urgent Rates. We should get an answer by this evening. But look here, Felix.\u0027\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was stubborn. ”There\u0027s a damned fast ship with a plane and forty men no one knows anything about. There\u0027s not another group or even an individual in the area who looks in the least promising. All right, so the outfit looks all right and its story seems to stand up. But just supposing the whole thing was a phony---a damned good one of course, but then so it ought to be with all that\u0027s at stake. Take another look at the picture. These so-called shareholders all arrive just in time for June third. On that night the Disco goes to sea and stays out till morning. Just supposing she rendezvous\u0027d that plane in shallow water somewhere. Just suppose she picked up the bombs and put them away---in the sand under the ship, if you like. Anyway, somewhere safe and convenient. Just suppose all that and what sort of a picture do you get?\u0027\u0027 “A B picture so far as I\u0027m concerned, James.\u0027\u0027 Leiter shrugged resignedly. ”But I guess there\u0027s just enough to make it a lead.\u0027\u0027 He laughed sardonically. \"But I\u0027d rather shoot myself than put it in tonight\u0027s report. If we\u0027re going to make fools of ourselves, we\u0027d better do it well out of sight and sound of our chiefs. So what\u0027s on your mind? What comes next?\u0027\u0027 “While you get our communications going, I\u0027m going to check with the oiling wharf. Then we\u0027ll call up this Domino girl and try and get ourselves asked for a drink and have a quick look at Largo\u0027s shore base---this Palmyra. Then we go to the Casino and look over the whole of Largo\u0027s group. And then\u0027\u0027---Bond looked stubbornly at Leiter ---”I\u0027m going to borrow a good man from the Police Commission to give me a hand, put on an aqualung, and go out and have a sniff round the Disco with your other Geiger machine.\u0027\u0027 Leiter said laconically, \"Destry Rides Again! Well, I\u0027ll go along with that, James. Just for old times\u0027 sake. But don\u0027t go and stub your toe on a sea urchin or anything. I see there are free cha-cha lessons in the ballroom of the Royal Bahamian tomorrow. We\u0027ve got to keep fit for those. I guess there\u0027ll be nothing else in this trip for my memory book.\u0027\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-21.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \"The girl looked him up and down.
