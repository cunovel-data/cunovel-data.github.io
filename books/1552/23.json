Reprieved, but clutching at his scraps of professional dignity, he snapped his fingers for the waiter to take away the glasses. \"Okay, suh. Whatever you says. But we\u0027ve pot plenty overheads here and the majority of customers they doan complain.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n Leiter said, \"Well, here\u0027s one who\u0027s dry behind the ears. A good barman should learn to be able to recognize the serious drinker from the status-seeker who wants just to be seen in your fine bar.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \"Yassuh.\u0027\u0027 The barman moved away with Negro dignity.\\n\\n Bond said, \"You got those figures right, Felix? I always knew one got clipped, but I thought only about a hundred per cent---not four or five.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n “Young man, since I graduated from Government Service to Pinkertons, the scales have dropped from my eyes. The cheating that goes on in hotels and restaurants is more sinful than all the rest of the sin in the world. Anyone in a tuxedo before seven in the evening is a crocodile, and if he couldn\u0027t take a good bite at your pocketbook he\u0027d take a good bite at your ear. The same goes for the rest of the consumer business, even when it\u0027s not wearing a tuxedo. Sometimes it gets me real mad to have to eat and drink the muck you get and then see what you\u0027re charged for it. Look at our damned lunch today. Six, seven bucks with fifteen per cent added for what\u0027s called service. And then the waiter hangs about for another fifty cents for riding up in the elevator with the stuff. Hell\u0027\u0027---Leiter ran an angry hand through his mop of straw hair---”just don\u0027t let\u0027s talk about it. I\u0027m fit to bust a gut when I think about it.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n The drinks came. They were excellent. Leiter calmed down and ordered a second round. He said, “Now let\u0027s get angry about something else.\u0027\u0027 He laughed curtly. ”Guess I\u0027m just sore at being back in Government Service again watching all the taxpayers\u0027 money going down the drain on this wild goose chase. Mark you, James\u0027\u0027---there was apology in Leiter\u0027s voice---“I\u0027m not saying this whole operation isn\u0027t a true bill, hell of a ------ mess in fact, but what riles me is that we should be a couple of arse-end Charlies stuck down on this sand spit while the other guys have got the hot spots---you know, places where something really may be happening---or at least likely to happen. Tell you the truth, I felt like a damned fool gumshoeing around that feller\u0027s yacht this afternoon with my little Geiger toy.\u0027\u0027 He looked keenly at Bond. ”You don\u0027t find you grow out of these things? I mean it\u0027s all right when there\u0027s a war on. But it seems kinda childish when Peace is bustin\u0027 out all over.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n Bond said doubtfully, “Of course I know what you mean, Felix. Perhaps it\u0027s just that in England we don\u0027t feel quite as secure as you do in America. The war just doesn\u0027t seem to have ended for us--- Berlin, Cyprus, Kenya, Suez, let alone these jobs with people like SMERSH that I used to get tangled up in. There always seems to be something boiling up somewhere. Now this damned business. Dare say I\u0027m taking it all too seriously, but there\u0027s something fishy going on around here. I checked up on that fuel problem and Largo certainly told us a lie.\u0027\u0027 Bond gave the details of what he had learned at police headquarters. ”I feel I\u0027ve got to make sure tonight. You realize there\u0027s only about seventy hours to go? If I find anything, I suggest tomorrow we take a small plane and really run a search over as much of the area as we can. That plane\u0027s a big thing to hide even under water. You still got your license?\u0027\u0027\\n\\n “Sure, sure.\u0027\u0027 Leiter shrugged his shoulders. ”I\u0027ll go along with you. Of course I will. If we find anything, perhaps the signal I got this evening won\u0027t look so damned silly after all.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n So this was what had put Leiter into such a vile temper! Bond said, \"What was that?\u0027\u0027\\n\\n Leiter took a drink and gazed morosely into his glass. “Well, for my money it\u0027s just so much more attitudinizing by those power-struck fatcats at the Pentagon. But that sheaf of stuff I was waving about was a circular to all our men on this job to say that the Army and the Navy and the Air Force are holding themselves ready to give full support to C.I.A. if anything turns up. Think of that, dammit!\u0027\u0027 Leiter looked angrily at Bond. ”Think of the waste of fuel and manpower that must be going on all over the world keeping all these units at readiness! Just to show you, know what I\u0027ve been allocated as my striking force?\u0027\u0027 Leiter gave a harsh, derisive laugh. “Half squadron of Super Sabre fighter bombers from Pensacola, and---\u0027\u0027 Leiter stabbed at Bond\u0027s forearm with a hard finger---”and, my friend, the Manta! The ------ Manta! Our latest ------ atomic submarine!\u0027\u0027 When Bond smiled at all this vehemence, Leiter continued more reasonably: \"Mark you, it\u0027s not quite so idiotic as it sounds. These Sabres are on anti-submarine sweep duties anyway. Carrying depth charges. They have to be at readiness. And the Manta happens to be on some sort of a training cruise in the area, getting ready to go under the South Pole for a change I suppose, or some other damned promotion job to help along the Navy Estimates. But I ask you! Here\u0027s all these million dollars\u0027 worth of material on instant call from Ensign Leiter, commanding Room 201 in the Royal Bahamian Hotel! Not bad!\u0027\u0027\\n\\n Bond shrugged his shoulders. \"Seems to me your President is taking all this a bit more seriously than his man in Nassau. I suppose our Chiefs of Staff have weighed in with our stuff on the other side of the Atlantic. Anyway, no harm in having the big battalions in the offing just in case Nassau Casino happens to be Target No. 1. By the way, what ideas have your people got about these targets? What have you got in this part of the world that fits in with SPECTRE\u0027S letter? We\u0027ve only got the joint rocket base at a place called Northwest Cay at the eastern end of the Grand Bahamas. That\u0027s about a hundred and fifty miles north of here. Apparently the gear and prototypes we and your people have got there would easily be worth £100,000,000.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \"The only possible targets I\u0027ve been given are Cape Canaveral, the naval base at Pensacola, and, if the party really is going to take place in this area, Miami for target No. 2, with Tampa as a possible runner-up. SPECTRE used the words `a piece of property belonging to the Western Powers.\u0027 That sounds like some kind of installation to me--- something like the uranium mines in the Congo, for instance. But a rocket base would fit all right. If we\u0027ve got to take this thing seriously, I\u0027d lay odds on Canaveral or this place on Grand Bahama. Only thing I can\u0027t understand, if they\u0027ve got these bombs, how are they going to transport them to the target and set them off?\u0027\u0027\\n\\n “A submarine could do it--- just lay one of the bombs offshore through a torpedo tube. Or a sailing dinghy, for the matter of that. Apparently exploding these things is no problem so long as they recovered all the parts from the plane. Apparently you\u0027d just have to insert some kind of fuse thing in the right place between the T.N.T. and the plutonium, and screw the impact fuse off the nose and fit a time fuse that would give you time to get a hundred miles away.\u0027\u0027 Bond added casually, ”Have to have an expert who knows the drill of course, but the trip would be no problem for the Disco , for instance. She could lay the bomb off Grand Bahama at midnight and be back at anchor off Palmyra by breakfast time.\u0027\u0027 He smiled. \"See what I mean? It all adds up.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n “Nuts,\u0027\u0027 said Leiter succinctly. ”You\u0027ll have to do better than that if you want my blood pressure to go up. Anyway, let\u0027s get the hell out of here and go have ourselves some eggs and bacon in one of those clip joints on Bay Street. It\u0027ll cost us twenty dollars plus tax, but the Manta probably burns that every time her screws turn full circle. Then we\u0027ll go along to the Casino and see if Mr. Fuchs or Signor Pontecorvo is sitting beside Largo at the blackjack table.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n 15.\\n\\n Cardboard Hero\\n\\n The Nassau Casino is the only legal casino on British soil anywhere in the world. How this is justified under the laws of the Commonwealth no one can quite figure. It is leased each year to a Canadian gambling syndicate and their operating profits in the smart winter season are estimated to average around $100,000. The only games played are roulette, with two zeros instead of one, which increases the take to the house from the European 3.6 to a handsome 5.4; blackjack, or 21, on which the house makes between 6 and 7 per cent; and one table of chemin de fer , whose cagnotte yields a modest 5 per cent. The operation is run as a club in a handsome private house on West Bay Street and there is a pleasant dance and supper room with a three-piece combo that plays old favorites in strict time, and a lounge bar. It is a well-run, elegant place that deserves its profit.\\n\\n The Governor\u0027s A.D.C. had presented Bond and Leiter with membership cards, and after they had had coffee and a stinger at the bar they separated and went to the tables.\\n\\n Largo was playing chemin de fer . He had a fat pile of hundred-dollar plaques in front of him and half a dozen of the big yellow thousand-dollar biscuits. Domino Vitali sat behind him chain-smoking and watching the play. Bond observed the game from a distance. Largo was playing expansively, bancoing whenever he could and letting his own banks run. He was winning steadily, but with excellent manners, and by the way people joked with him and applauded his coups he was obviously a favorite in the Casino. Domino, in black with a square-cut neckline and with one large diamond on a thin chain at her throat, was looking morose and bored. The woman on Largo\u0027s right, having bancoed him three times and lost, got up and left the table. Bond went quickly across the room and slid into the empty place. It was a bank of eight hundred dollars---the round sum being due to Largo making up the cagnotte after each play.\\n\\n It is good for the banker when he has got past the third banco. It often means the bank is going to run. Bond knew this perfectly well. He was also painfully aware that his total capital was only one thousand dollars. But the fact that everyone was so nervous of Largo\u0027s luck made him bold. And, after all, the table has no memory. Luck, he told himself, is strictly for the birds. He said, \"Banco.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n “Ah, my good friend Mr. Bond.\u0027\u0027 Largo held out a hand. ”Now we have the big money coming to the table. Perhaps I should pass the bank. The English know how to play at railway trains. But still\u0027\u0027--- he smiled charmingly---\"if I have to lose I would certainly like to lose to Mr. Bond.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n The big brown hand gave the shoe a soft slap. Largo eased out the pink tongue of playing card and moved it across the baize to Bond. He took one for himself and then pressed out one more for each of them. Bond picked up his first card and flicked it face up into the middle of the table. It was a nine, the nine of diamonds. Bond glanced sideways at Largo. He said, \"That is always a good start---so good that I will also face my second card.\u0027\u0027 He casually flicked it out to join the nine. It turned over in mid-air and fell besides the nine. It was a glorious ten, the ten of spades. Unless Largo\u0027s two cards also added up to nine or nineteen, Bond had won.\\n\\n Largo laughed, but the laugh had a hard edge to it. “You certainly make me try,\u0027\u0027 he said gaily. He threw his cards to follow Bond\u0027s. They were the eight of hearts and the king of clubs. Largo had lost by a pip---two naturals, but one just better than the other, the crudest way to lose. Largo laughed hugely. ”Somebody had to be second,\u0027\u0027 he said to the table at large. \"What did I say? The English can pull what they like out of the shoe.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n The croupier pushed the chips across to Bond. Bond made a small pile of them. He gestured at the heap in front of Largo: \"So, it seems, can the Italians. I told you this afternoon we should go into partnership.\u0027\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-23.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \\n \"The girl looked him up and down.
