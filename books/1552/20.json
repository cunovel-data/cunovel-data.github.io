Leiter checked in and they went up to his room and sent for two double dry martinis on the rocks and the menu.\n From the pretentious dishes, “For Your Particular Consideration,\u0027\u0027 printed in Ornamental Gothic, Bond chose Native Seafood Cocktail Supreme followed by Disjointed Home Farm Chicken, Sauté au Cresson, which was described in italics as ”Tender Farm Chicken, Broiled to a Rich Brown, Basted with Creamery Butter and Disjointed for Your Convenience. Price 38/6 or dollars 5.35.\u0027\u0027 Felix Leiter went for the Baltic Herring in Sour Cream followed by \"Chopped Tenderloin of Beef, French Onion Rings (Our Renowned Beef is Chef-Selected from the Finest Corn-fed, Mid-Western Cattle, and Aged to Perfection to Assure You of the Very Best). Price 40/3 or dollars 5.65.\u0027\u0027\n When they had both commented sourly and at length about the inflated bogosity of tourist-hotel food and particularly the mendacious misuse of the English language to describe materials which had certainly been in various deepfreezes for at least six months, they settled down on the balcony to discuss Bond\u0027s findings of the morning. Half an hour and one more double dry martini later, their luncheon came. The whole thing amounted to about five shillings\u0027 worth of badly cooked rubbish. They ate in a mood of absent-minded irritation, saying nothing. Finally Leiter threw down his knife and fork. “This is hamburger and bad hamburger. The French onion rings were never in France, and what\u0027s more\u0027\u0027---he poked at the remains with a fork---”they\u0027re not even rings. They\u0027re oval.\u0027\u0027 He looked belligerently across at Bond. \"All right, Hawkshaw. Where do we go from here?\u0027\u0027\n “The major decision is to eat out in future. The next is to pay a visit to the Disco ---now.\u0027\u0027 Bond got up from the table. ”When we\u0027ve done that, we\u0027ll have to decide whether or not these people are hunting pieces of eight or £100,000,000. Then we\u0027ll have to report progress.\u0027\u0027 Bond waved at the packing cases in a corner of the room. \"I\u0027ve got the loan of a couple of rooms on the top floor of police headquarters here. The Commissioner\u0027s cooperative and a solid character. These Colonial Police are good, and this one\u0027s a cut above the rest. We can set up the radio there and make contact this evening. Tonight there\u0027s this party at the Casino. We\u0027ll go to that and see if any of these faces mean anything to either of us. The first thing\u0027s to see if the yacht\u0027s clean or not. Can you break that Geiger counter out?\u0027\u0027\n “Sure. And it\u0027s a honey.\u0027\u0027 Leiter went to the cases, selected one, and opened it. He came back carrying what looked like a Rolleiflex camera in a portable leather case. ”Here, give me a hand.\u0027\u0027 Leiter took off his wrist watch and strapped on what appeared to be another watch. He slung the “camera\u0027\u0027 by its strap over his left shoulder. ”Now run those wires from the watch up my sleeve and down inside my coat. Right. Now these two small plugs go through these holes in my coat pocket and into the two holes in the box. Got it? Now we\u0027re all fixed.\u0027\u0027 Leiter stood back and posed. “Man with a camera and a wrist watch.\u0027\u0027 He unbuttoned the flap of the camera. ”See? Perfectly good lenses and all that. Even a button to press in case you have to seem to take a picture. But in back of the make-believe there\u0027s a metal valve, a circuit, and batteries. Now take a look at this watch. And it is a watch.\u0027\u0027 He held it under Bond\u0027s eyes. “Only difference is that it\u0027s a very small watch mechanism and that sweep secondhand is a meter that takes the radioactive count. Those wires up the sleeve hitch it on to the machine. Now then. You\u0027re still wearing that old wrist watch of yours with the big phosphorus numerals. So I walk round the room for a moment to get the background count. That\u0027s basic. All sorts of things give off radiation of some sort. And I take an occasional glance at my watch---nervous type, and I\u0027ve got an appointment coming up. Now here, by the bathroom, all that metal is giving off something and my watch is registering positive, but very little. Nothing else in the room and I\u0027ve established the amount of background interference I\u0027ll have to discount when I start to get hot. Right? Now I come close up to you and my camera\u0027s only a few inches away from your hand. Here, took a look. Put your watch right up against the counter. See! The sweephand is getting all excited. Move your watch away and it loses interest. It\u0027s those phosphorus numerals of yours. Remember the other day one of the watch companies withdrew an air pilots\u0027 watch from the market because the Atomic Energy People got fussy? Same thing. They thought this particular pilots\u0027 watch, with the big phosphorescent numerals, was giving off too much radiation to be good for the wearer. Of course\u0027\u0027---Leiter patted the camera case---”this is a special job. Most types give off a clicking sound, and if you\u0027re prospecting for uranium, which is the big market for these machines, you wear earphones to try and pick up the stuff underground. For this job we don\u0027t need anything so sensitive. If we get near where those bombs are hidden, this damned sweephand\u0027ll go right off the dial. Okay? So let\u0027s go hire ourselves a sixpenny sick and pay a call on the ocean greyhound.\u0027\u0027\n 13.\n \"My Name Is Emilio Largo\u0027\u0027\n Leiter\u0027s “sixpenny sick\u0027\u0027 was the hotel launch, a smart Chrysler-engined speedboat that said it would be $20 an hour. They ran out westward from the harbor, past Silver Cay, Long Cay, and Balmoral Island and round Delaporte Point. Five miles farther down the coast, encrusted with glittering seashore properties the boatman said cost £400 per foot of beach frontage, they rounded Old Fort Point and came upon the gleaming white and dark blue ship lying with two anchors out in deep water just outside the reef. Leiter whistled. He said in an awestruck voice, ”Boy, is that a piece of boat! I\u0027d sure like to have one of those to play with in my bath.\u0027\u0027\n Bond said, \"She\u0027s Italian. Built by a firm called Rodrigues at Messina. Thing called an Aliscafo . She\u0027s got a hydrofoil under the hull and when she gets going you let this sort of skid down and she rises up and practically flies. Only the screws and a few feet of the stern stay in the water. The Police Commissioner says she can do fifty knots in calm water. Only good for inshore work of course, but they can carry upwards of a hundred passengers when they\u0027re designed as fast ferries. Apparently this one\u0027s been designed for about forty. The rest of the space is taken up with the owner\u0027s quarters and cargo space. Must have cost damned near a quarter of a million.\u0027\u0027\n The boatman broke in. “They say on Bay Street that she goin\u0027 go after the treasure these next few days or so. All the people that own share in the gold come in a few days ago. Then she spen\u0027 one whole night doin\u0027 a final recce. They say is down Exhuma way, or over by Watlings Island. Guess you folks know that\u0027s where Columbus make him first landfall on this side of the Atlantic. Around fourteen ninety somethin\u0027. But could be anywhere down there. They\u0027s always been talk of treasure down \u0027mongst the Ragged Islands---even as far as Crooked Island. Fact is she sail out southward. Hear her myself, right until her engines died away. East by southeast, I\u0027da say.\u0027\u0027 The boatman spat discreetly over the side. ”Must be plenty heap of treasure with the cost of that ship and all the money they throwing \u0027way. Every time she go to the Hoiling Wharf they say the bill\u0027s five hundred pound.\u0027\u0027\n Bond said casually, \"Which night was it they did the final recce?\u0027\u0027\n \"Night after she hoiled. That\u0027d be two nights ago. Sail round six.\u0027\u0027\n The blank portholes of the ship watched them approach. A sailor polishing brass round the curve of the enclosed dome that was the bridge walked through the hatch into the bridge and Bond could see him talking into a mouthpiece. A tall man in white ducks and a very wide mesh singlet appeared on deck and observed them through binoculars. He called something to the sailor, who came and stood at the top of the ladder down the starboard side. When their launch came alongside, the man cupped his hands and called down, \"What is your business, please? Have you an appointment?\u0027\u0027\n Bond called back, \"It\u0027s Mr. Bond, Mr. James Bond. From New York. I have my attorney here. I have an inquiry to make about Palmyra, Mr. Largo\u0027s property.\u0027\u0027\n “One moment, please.\u0027\u0027 The sailor disappeared and returned accompanied by the man in white ducks and singlet. Bond recognized him from the police description. He called down cheerfully, ”Come aboard, come aboard.\u0027\u0027 He gestured for the sailor to go down and help fend the launch. Bond and Leiter climbed out of the launch and went up the ladder.\n Largo held out a hand. \"My name is Emilio Largo. Mr. Bond?\u0027\u0027\n And . . .?\u0027\u0027\n “Mr. Larkin, my attorney from New York. Actually I\u0027m English, but I have property in America.\u0027\u0027 They shook hands. ”I\u0027m sorry to bother you, Mr. Largo, but it\u0027s about Palmyra, the property I believe you rent from Mr. Bryce.\u0027\u0027\n “Ah, yes, of course.\u0027\u0027 The beautiful teeth gleamed warmth and welcome. ”Come on down to the stateroom, gentlemen. I\u0027m sorry I am not properly dressed to receive you.\u0027\u0027 The big brown hands caressed his flanks, the wide mouth turned down in deprecation. \"My visitors usually announce themselves on the ship-to-shore. But if you will forgive the informality . . .\u0027\u0027 Largo allowed the phrase to die on the air and ushered them through a low hatch and down a few aluminum steps into the main cabin. The rubber-lined hatch hissed to behind him.\n It was a fine large cabin paneled in mahogany with a deep wine-Red carpet and comfortable dark blue leather club chairs. The sun shining through the slats of Venetian blinds over the broad square ports added a touch of gay light to an otherwise rather somber and masculine room, its long center table littered with papers and charts, glass-fronted cabinets containing fishing gear and an array of guns and other weapons, and a black rubber underwater diving suit and aqualung suspended, almost like the skeleton in a sorcerer\u0027s den, from a rack in one corner. The air-conditioning made the cabin deliciously cool, and Bond felt his damp shirt slowly freeing itself from his skin.\n “Please take a chair, gentlemen.\u0027\u0027 Largo carelessly brushed aside the charts and papers on the table as if they were of no importance. ”Cigarettes?\u0027\u0027 He placed a large silver box between them. “And now what can I get you to drink?\u0027\u0027 He went to the loaded sideboard. ”Something cool and not too strong perhaps? A Planter\u0027s Punch? Gin and tonic? Or there are various beers. You must have had a hot journey in that open launch. I would have sent my boat for you if only I had known.\u0027\u0027\n They both asked for a plain tonic. Bond said, \"I\u0027m very sorry to barge in like this, Mr. Largo, No idea I could have got you on the telephone. We just got in this morning, and as I\u0027ve only a few days I have to get a move on. The point is, I\u0027m looking for a property down here.\u0027\u0027\n “Oh, yes?\u0027\u0027 Largo brought the glasses and bottles of tonic to the table and sat down so that they formed a comfortable group. ”What a good idea. Wonderful place. I\u0027ve been here f9r six months and already I\u0027d like to stay forever. But the prices they\u0027re asking---\u0027\u0027 Largo threw up his hands. \"These Bay Street pirates. And the millionaires, they are even worse. But you are wise to come at the end of the season. Perhaps some of the owners are disappointed not to have sold. Perhaps they will not open their mouths so wide.\u0027\u0027\n “That\u0027s what I thought.\u0027\u0027 Bond sat comfortably back and lit a cigarette. ”Or rather what my lawyer, Mr. Larkin, advised.\u0027\u0027 Leiter shook his head pessimistically. “He had made some inquiries and he frankly advised that real-estate values down here have gone mad.\u0027\u0027 Bond turned politely toward Leiter to bring him into the conversation. ”Isn\u0027t that so?\u0027\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thunderball-james-bond-9/page-20.html","bookId":1552,"book":{"id":1552,"title":"Thunderball (James Bond #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Thunderball (James Bond (Original Series) #9) \n \"The girl looked him up and down.
