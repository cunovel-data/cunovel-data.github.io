{"id":98319,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"I wait for him to break it to me gently. How does the enemy think?\\n\\n “Much of what we assumed is correct. They have been watching us for some time. Infestations were embedded in key individuals around the world, sleeper agents, if you will, waiting for the signal to launch a coordinated attack after our population had been whittled down to a manageable number. We know how that attack turned out here at Camp Haven, and we strongly suspect that other military installations were not as fortunate.”\\n\\n He slaps the paper on his thigh. I must have flinched, because he gives me a reassuring smile.\\n\\n “A third of the surviving population. Planted here to eradicate those who survived the first three waves. You. Me. Your team members. All of us. If you have any fear, as poor Tank did, that a fifth wave is coming, you can put it aside. There will be no fifth wave. They have no intention of leaving their mothership until the human race is exterminated.”\\n\\n “Is that why they haven’t…?”\\n\\n “Attacked us again? We think so. It seems their foremost desire is to preserve the planet for colonization. Now we are in a war of attrition. Our resources are limited; they can’t last forever. We know it. They know it. Cut off from supplies, with no means to marshal any significant fighting force, eventually this camp—and any others out there like it—will wither and die, like a vine cut off from its roots.”\\n\\n Weird. He’s still smiling. Like something about this doomsday scenario turns him on.\\n\\n “So what do we do?” I ask.\\n\\n “The only thing we can do, Sergeant. We take the battle to them.”\\n\\n The way he says it: no doubt, no fear, no hopelessness. We take the battle to them. That’s why he’s the commander. Standing over me, smiling, confident, his chiseled features reminding me of some ancient statue, noble, wise, strong. He is the rock against which the alien waves crash, and he is unbroken. We are humanity, the banner read. Wrong. We’re pale reflections of it, weak shadows, distant echoes. He is humanity, the beating, unbeaten, invincible heart of it. In that moment, if Commander Vosch had told me to put a bullet through my head for the cause, I would have. I would have without a second thought.\\n\\n “Which brings us back to your assignment,” he says quietly. “Our recon flights have identified significant pockets of infested combatants clustered in and around Dayton. A squad will be dropped in—and for the next four hours, it will be on its own. The odds of making it out alive are roughly one in four.”\\n\\n I clear my throat. “And two squads stay here.”\\n\\n He nods. Blue eyes boring deep—to the marrow deep. “Your call.”\\n\\n That same small, secretive smile. He knows what I’m going to say. He knew before I walked through the door. Maybe my Wonderland profile told him, but I don’t think so. He knows me.\\n\\n I rise from the chair to full attention.\\n\\n And tell him what he already knows.\\n\\n 52\\n\\n AT 0900 the entire battalion musters in the yard, creating a sea of blue jumpsuits headed by the top four squads in their crisp new fatigues. Over a thousand recruits standing in perfect formation, facing east, the direction of new beginnings, toward the speakers’ platform erected the day before. Flags snap in the icy breeze, but we don’t feel the cold. We are lit from within by a fire hotter than the one that turned Tank into ash. The brass of Central Command moves down the first line—the winning line—shaking our hands and congratulating us for a job well done. Then a personal word of gratitude from the drill instructors. I’ve been dreaming of what to say to Reznik when he shakes my hand. Thanks for making my life a living hell…Oh, die. Just die, you son of a bitch… Or my favorite, short and sweet and to the point: Eff you. But when he salutes and offers me his hand, I almost lose it. I want to hit him in the face and hug him at the same time.\\n\\n “Congratulations, Ben,” he says, which totally throws me off. I had no idea he even knew my name. He gives me a wink and continues down the line.\\n\\n There’re a couple of short speeches by officers I’ve never seen before. Then the supreme commander is introduced and the troops go crazy, waving our hats, pumping our fists. Our cheers echo off the buildings encircling the yard, making the roar twice as loud and us seem twice as many. Commander Vosch raises his hand very slowly and deliberately to his forehead, and it’s as if he hit a switch: The noise cuts off as we raise our own hands in salute. I can hear quiet snuffling all around me. It’s too much. After what brought us here and what we went through here, after all the blood and death and fire, after being shown the ugly mirror of the past through Wonderland and facing the uglier truth of the future in the execution room, after months of brutal training that pushed some of us past the point of no return, we have arrived. We have survived the death of our childhood. We are soldiers now, maybe the last soldiers who will ever fight, the Earth’s final and only hope, united as one in the spirit of vengeance.\\n\\n I don’t hear a word of Vosch’s speech. I watch the sun rising over his shoulder, framed between the twin towers of the power plant, its light glinting off the mothership in orbit, the sole imperfection in the otherwise perfect sky. So small, so insignificant. I feel like I can reach up and pluck it from the sky, throw it to the ground, grind it to dust beneath my heel. The fire in my chest grows white-hot, spreads over every inch of my body. It melts my bones; it incinerates my skin; I am the sun gone supernova.\\n\\n I was wrong about Ben Parish dying on the day he left the convalescent ward. I’ve been carrying his stinking corpse inside me all through basic. Now the last of him is burned away as I stare up at the solitary figure who lit that fire. The man who showed me the true battlefield. Who emptied me so I might be filled. Who killed me so I might live. And I swear I can see him staring back at me with those icy blue eyes that see down to the bottom of my soul, and I know—I know—what he’s thinking.\\n\\n We are one, you and I. Brothers in hate, brothers in cunning, brothers in the spirit of vengeance.\\n\\n 53\\n\\n YOU SAVED ME.\\n\\n Lying in his arms that night with those words in my ears, and I’m thinking, Idiot, idiot, idiot. You can’t do this. You can’t, you can’t, you can’t.\\n\\n The first rule: Trust no one. Which leads to the second rule: The only way to stay alive as long as possible is to stay alone as long as possible.\\n\\n Now I’ve broken both.\\n\\n Oh, they’re so clever. The harder survival becomes, the more you want to pull together. And the more you want to pull together, the harder survival becomes.\\n\\n The point is I had my chance and I didn’t do so well on my own. In fact, I sucked. I would have died if Evan hadn’t found me.\\n\\n His body is pressed against my back, his arm is wrapped protectively around my waist, his breath a delicious tickle against my neck. The room is very cold; it would be nice to climb under the covers, but I don’t want to move. I don’t want him to move. I run my fingers along his bare forearm, remembering the warmth of his lips, the silkiness of his hair between my fingers. The boy who never sleeps, sleeping. Coming to rest upon the Cassiopeian shore, an island in the middle of a sea of blood. You have your promise, and I have you.\\n\\n I can’t trust him. I have to trust him.\\n\\n I can’t stay with him. I can’t leave him behind.\\n\\n You can’t trust luck anymore. The Others have taught me that.\\n\\n But can you still trust love?\\n\\n Not that I love him. I don’t even know what love feels like. I know how Ben Parish made me feel, which can’t be put into words, or at least any words I know.\\n\\n Evan stirs behind me. “It’s late,” he murmurs. “You’d better get some sleep.”\\n\\n How did he know I’m awake? “What about you?”\\n\\n He rolls off the bed and pads toward the door. I sit up, my heart racing, not sure exactly why. “Where are you going?”\\n\\n “Going to look around a little. I won’t be long.”\\n\\n After he leaves, I strip off my clothes and slip on one of his plaid lumberjack shirts. Val had been into the frilly sleepwear. Not my style.\\n\\n I climb back into bed and pull the covers up to my chin. Dang, it’s cold. I listen to the quiet. Of the Evanless house, that is. Outside are the sounds of nature unleashed. The distant barking of wild dogs. The howl of a wolf. The screech of owls. It’s winter, the time of year when nature whispers. I expect a symphony of wild things once spring arrives.\\n\\n I wait for him to come back. An hour goes by. Then two.\\n\\n I hear the telltale creak again and hold my breath. I usually hear him come in at night. The kitchen door slamming. The heavy tread of his boots coming up the stairs. Now I hear nothing but the creaking on the other side of the door.\\n\\n I reach over and pick up the Luger from the bedside table. I always keep it near me.\\n\\n He’s dead was my first thought. It isn’t Evan outside that door; it’s a Silencer.\\n\\n I slide out of bed and tiptoe to the door. Press my ear against the wood. Close my eyes to focus. Holding the gun in the proper two-handed grip, the way he taught me. Rehearsing every step in my head, like he taught me.\\n\\n Left hand on knob. Turn, pull, two steps back, gun up. Turn, pull, two steps back, gun up…\\n\\n Creeaaaaaak.\\n\\n Okay, that’s it.\\n\\n I fling open the door, take just one step back—so much for rehearsal—and bring up the gun. Evan jumps back and smacks against the wall, his hands flying up reflexively when he sees the muzzle glinting in front of his face.\\n\\n “Hey!” he shouts. Eyes wide, hands up, like he’s been jumped by a mugger.\\n\\n “What the hell are you doing?” I’m shaking with anger.\\n\\n “I was coming back to—to check on you. Can you put the gun down, please?”\\n\\n “You know I didn’t have to open it,” I snarl at him, lowering the gun. “I could have shot you through the door.”\\n\\n “Next time I’ll definitely knock.” He gives me his trademark lopsided smile.\\n\\n “Let’s establish a code for when you want to go all creeper on me. One knock means you’d like to come in. Two means you’re just stopping by to spy on me while I sleep.” His eyes travel from my face to my shirt (which happens to be his shirt) to my bare legs, lingering a breath too long before returning to my face. His gaze is warm. My legs are cold.\\n\\n Then he knocks once on the jamb. But it’s the smile that gets him in.\\n\\n We sit on the bed. I try to ignore the fact that I’m wearing his shirt and that shirt smells like him and he’s sitting about a foot away also smelling like him and also that there’s a hard little knot in the pit of my stomach like a smoldering lump of coal.\\n\\n I want him to touch me again. I want to feel his hands, as soft as clouds. But I’m afraid if he touches me, all seven billion billion billion atoms that make up my body will blow apart and scatter across the universe.\\n\\n “Is he alive?” he whispers. That sad, desperate look is back. What happened out there? Why is he thinking about Sams?\\n\\n I shrug. How can I know the answer to that?\\n\\n “I knew when Lauren was. I mean, I knew when she wasn’t.” Picking at the quilt, running his fingers over the stitching, tracing the borders of the patches like he’s tracing the path on a treasure map. “I felt it. It was just me and Val then. Val was pretty sick, and I knew she didn’t have much time. I knew the timing, almost down to the hour: I’d been through it six times.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-5th-wave-the-5th-wave-1/page-35.html","bookId":1642,"book":{"id":1642,"title":"The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave #1)","description":"Storyline: The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave #1) \\n After the 1st wave, only darkness remains.
