{"id":80620,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"“Fuck,” I groan, nearly collapsing on top of her as I bury my face in her neck. I start to pump into her hard, needing her and needing to bind us together. It’s as if I can somehow fuse her to me with every thrust.\n My breathing is labored as I try to hold on long enough so that Tessa cums, too, but I fear it’s hopeless. Her legs come up around my hips, one hand on my back, clinging to me, and one in my hair, pulling it.\n “Oh, God, baby. I can’t—”\n “I’m yours,” she whispers, as she licks my ear, and I’m done for.\n Her words send me over the edge, cumming inside her with a loud moan. I grip her body tightly to me as I hold myself inside her, releasing my orgasm, emptying my thick load into her. I try to catch my breath. Holding her to me, I start to move again, needing to get her off as well.\n I sit up a little and reach between us. I feel her clit slick with her need and my cum. “Now you owe me two orgasms, little fox. And I’m going to get them.”\n I lean down and take a nipple in my mouth, and again her hand goes to my hair, holding me in place. I lightly bite it and then move to the other, making sure to give equal treatment. I feel her tight channel clench me, and her wet nectar slips down between us.\n I thumb her clit harder, and with just the slight pressure on her tits, she tenses under me and shouts out her orgasm. Her body ripples, and she moans my name as she pulls me tighter to her. It makes me feel needed and forgiven, and I want it all over again.\n “Another,” I mumble against her nipple, moving down and biting the thick flesh around it. “Another orgasm, and this time I cum with you.”\n “Oh, God,” she moans, and moves her hips under me.\n Her first orgasm is still there, just barely dissipated as I rub her sensitive clit again and move back and forth between her nipples. I steadily thrust into her, and her body winds tighter and tighter.\n “I love you, Tessa. You’re mine, and I’ll never let you go.”\n “Sean,” she moans, and then her orgasm begins again.\n I feel the tingle run up my cock and out the head as I thrust into her one final time, cumming into her womb. Her tight pulses pull my own orgasm from me as I give her body what it begs for.\n Before she can come down from her orgasm, I flip us over so she’s on top of me, straddling my cock and lying on my chest.\n “More, Tessa,” I whisper against her neck. I gently thrust into her, slowly this time and less rushed. “I need much, much more.”\n She smiles down at me, then starts to move in time with my slow thrusts. “I guess we have a couple of days to make up for.”\n “We’ve got an entire island to make up on.”\n I feel my own smile match hers as our lips connect.\n Chapter 24\n Tessa\n “I think you reached your goal three days ago.” I look over my shoulder teasingly at Sean who has been kissing my back for the last twenty minutes, his beard tickling me.\n It’s late afternoon, and we’ve been lying on the beach most of the day. The warm breeze rolls in off the ocean, leaving a sweet smell in the air. I could lie here forever.\n “Just making sure,” he says against my skin, still pressing kisses all over me, stopping every now and then for a little nibble. I’ve noticed he likes to leave little love bites in random places on my body. I keep finding them when I turn in the mirror. Discovering a new one every time I look in the mirror makes me smile.\n He said he wanted to taste every part of me, and he’s been trying to reach that goal since. I’m pretty sure he got it the first day. I give him a soft smile before turning myself back to the ocean, letting him do as he pleases with me.\n Since I opened myself back up to him, he hasn’t wanted to be more than a foot from me. It was adorable, until he tried to follow me into the bathroom to pee. Hell, what am I thinking? That was pretty adorable, too.\n It didn’t take much for me to cave to Sean, but it’s hard to tell someone you don’t want something when you really want it. He’s offering a life that seems too good to be true, but like he said, he’s been showing me every day that he means it. I haven’t wanted for anything, and the main thing I crave is him, and he’s always at my side.\n My life changed the day he entered it. From the very first moment I saw him, I came alive. It was like I was just moving through the motions, one thing after another, doing what I thought I should be doing. Existing but not really living.\n He woke me up. It might have been crazy how we got here, but I can’t bring myself to be mad or upset about it anymore. I want to be here with him, and I’m done denying us both happiness.\n The island is almost like a dream. It’s like we’re in our own little world here and nothing can touch us. Sean says the main island isn’t that far away, but I don’t want to go anywhere right now. I like being alone and getting to know Sean more, learning about his experiences growing up on the streets and how it slowly led him to a life of crime.\n It made me ache for him and made me love him more than I thought was possible. I can’t imagine being so young and feeling so alone. I was little when I found out my parents weren’t coming back, but I had my grandmother to watch over me and love me the best she could. I can’t judge him for the choices he had to make. It started out as just surviving and then turned into all he knew.\n Now he wants a fresh start with me, and I want to give that to him. I want to be part of it because like him, I can’t see myself living without him. Once my anger started to cool, I could see more clearly. This man loves me, and he would do anything to keep me. Why would I turn my back on that? He doesn’t have to worry about that anymore because I’m not going anywhere. I’m not leaving this island. I’m his until I take my last breath. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-39.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
