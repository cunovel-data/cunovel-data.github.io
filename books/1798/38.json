{"id":80619,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"“There is no me without you. And if I have to spend the rest of my life making it up to you, then I’ll do it. I will never stop trying to prove to you that what I did was never meant to hurt you and was only meant to save you. To save me.”\\n\\n I walk over to the closet and pull out a small bag. I had Sal specifically pick up a few things that I knew Tessa would need if things went south. I didn’t go about doing this the right way, but I’ll die knowing the end justified the means.\\n\\n “The plan was to complete the robbery and then come back to you. I was going to get you after work and tell you to pack your things and run with me. I would have told you all of it and brought you here of your own free will. But that’s not what happened, and I have to deal with the aftermath. This may not make up for taking you from that bank, but I hope it helps.”\\n\\n I remove the tray and place the small bag in her lap, watching her fingers untangle from the sheet and slowly reach for it.\\n\\n I kneel beside the bed, and she looks at me skeptically as she unzips the bag.\\n\\n She pulls out the small brooch shaped like a fox. It was her grandmother’s. As recognition hits her, she looks up at me with watery eyes.\\n\\n “The first time I ever saw you, you were wearing that. I knew it meant a lot to you, and when you showed me the picture of your grandmother wearing it, I knew it had to come with us. You’ve been my little fox since the second I laid eyes on you, Tessa. I may have not done this the right way, but if you let me, I’ll love you enough to make up for this until the end of time.”\\n\\n She rubs her finger over the fox, tears running down her face. “I’m scared,” she whispers.\\n\\n I cup her hands in mine as she cradles the fox. “I’m scared, too, baby. I’m scared I fucked up everything and that you won’t forgive me. I’m scared that you won’t ever look at me and feel what you once felt. But mostly I’m scared because I don’t deserve you, and one day you’ll realize it.”\\n\\n “Sean.” She looks up to me with her big golden eyes, so hopeful and so soft.\\n\\n No sooner is the word out of her lips than I’m on them. She’s hesitant at first, but it only takes a half a second before she melts against me, opening her lips and letting me in.\\n\\n Her warm mouth tastes of syrup and sweetness, and she moans as I sweep my tongue in, claiming her. I get off the floor and sit on the bed, never breaking our kiss. I pull her to me, onto my lap, as I wrap my arms around her and hold her against my body.\\n\\n She moans as I suck her tongue and then nibble her lips, the last of her resistance slipping away. It feels as if she’s letting go of all the anger, and she’s as light as a feather. She’s delicate and fragile in my arms, and I’ll never break that gentle trust again. I’ll never do anything again to make her question me or my motives. Ever.\\n\\n I move my lips down her chin to her neck, needing to inhale her scent and taste every inch of her.\\n\\n “I love you, Sean. Don’t ever do that to me again.”\\n\\n I pull back and cup her face, looking into her liquid-gold eyes. “Never, baby. That life is in the past. It’s just us now. I love you so fucking much.”\\n\\n My lips are back on hers again, needing to know that this is real. That the worst is over and it’s all going to be okay.\\n\\n “Please,” Tessa begs, clinging to me. She pulls my body tighter to hers as she adjusts her position in my lap. She slings one leg around my waist so our cores are aligned, and her heat is against my solid cock.\\n\\n “Please what, little fox? Say the words and make them dirty.” I kiss down her neck, grazing the delicate skin there with my teeth.\\n\\n “I want you inside me. I need you cumming in me, Sean.”\\n\\n Her words send a shiver down my spine, and a little cum leaks inside my jeans. Breaking away from her neck, I look into her golden eyes and see need there.\\n\\n We both want to make up and bind ourselves to one another. “It’s been too long since I’ve been inside you, baby.” I hold her face with both hands before running my fingers down her chest to cup her breasts. “I won’t last long. I’m too desperate.”\\n\\n She nods a little at me, biting her lip. I see a blush creep across her cheeks, the little freckles there making her look so innocent and pure. Her gorgeous auburn hair flows around her as she grinds down on my erection, torturing me.\\n\\n “I think my little fox likes the idea of me cumming quick.”\\n\\n She’s got on pale pink panties and one of my oversized white T-shirts. I push the shirt up, exposing her underwear and watching as she moves her hips against me.\\n\\n “Is that what you want, Tessa? Do you want me to cum fast so we can do it over and over?” I look up, and she bites her lip again, nodding at me. “Say the words, little fox.”\\n\\n “Yes. I want you, and I want us. Make me remember why this is so perfect between us.”\\n\\n Grabbing her by the waist, I flip us over so she’s flat on her back. Her legs fall open as I move between them.\\n\\n “Take the shirt off. I wanna suck on your tits.”\\n\\n I reach down and unbuckle my jeans, pushing them down to my thighs. I’m too wound up to take them all the way off. I will after this first time, but right now I just need our important parts to connect. Just the essentials, and then we can take it slow.\\n\\n As soon as my cock is out, she falls back on the bed, the T-shirt gone. Immediately, I pull her panties to the side and press my cock to her opening.\\n\\n I look up into her eyes, and as her nails slightly scratch down my chest, I thrust inside her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-38.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
