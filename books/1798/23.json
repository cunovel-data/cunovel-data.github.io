I’ve got to get you clean, and I’m not putting my cock back inside you until you’re well fed and we give your pussy some time to rest.” Leaning down, he softly kisses me on the lips. “You sore?” His tone turns from playful to concerned. “I tried to be gentle, but with you…” His hand comes up to stroke the side of my face, his thumb grazing my cheek. “I find I get carried away. My control isn’t so great with you, but I’ll try to be gentler.”\\n\\n “It was perfect.” I turn my head to the side and kiss his palm, wanting him to know I mean it. “Just a little sore, but it was worth it.”\\n\\n I’m not sure how the man could be gentler with me. In fact, I liked it when he went a little rough with me in bed. The things he said, the things he’d made me say…it made me feel freaking sexy. A feeling I’m not used to. But he makes me feel that way.\\n\\n “I’ll make sure all of it’s worth it.” He places another soft kiss on my lips. His words seem to be about more than this moment, but he pulls away to turn on the shower and drags me in with him. Sean lets the water hit him first until he gets it to the temperature he likes. Then he pulls me under with him.\\n\\n He takes his time washing every inch of me. I cringe a little when he drops to his knees and starts washing my stomach and hips, the places on my body I’m most self-conscious of. Washing the soap away, he starts trailing open-mouthed kisses all over my belly and my hips before going lower.\\n\\n He slowly pushes me back until I’m against the shower wall. My breathing picks up as he stares right at my pussy.\\n\\n “I’m going to show you how good I’ll make you feel every day.” He licks his lips, his intent clear.\\n\\n “Every day?” I moan, just thinking about what he’s going to do. Put his mouth there. Holy shit. I close my eyes, dropping my head back, nervous and excited.\\n\\n “Every fucking day,” he confirms. His face goes right between my legs as one hand locks onto my hip. His other hand grabs my leg, throwing it over his shoulder as his mouth attacks me.\\n\\n He doesn’t tease; he goes straight for my clit, sucking it into his mouth. My hips jerk, but he keeps a firm hold on me.\\n\\n “Oh God, oh God,” I chant between moans, not able to put a thought together. His beard rubs along my inner thighs, and I’m sure there are going to be marks left behind.\\n\\n “Cum on my face, little fox. Show me how good I make you feel.” He sucks my clit back into his mouth again, and his words send me over the edge. My orgasm races through me, making me feel weightless. It’s not until a few moments later do I realize it’s because I’m back in his arms once again, cuddling into him.\\n\\n We stand there, letting the water run over us as we hold each other close. I have no idea how long we’re there, but I have no desire to leave, until I realize the water starts to run cold.\\n\\n “Come on, little fox. I need to feed you. Don’t want my curves going anywhere.” He kisses me right under my ear, where he just whispered the words.\\n\\n “You like my curves?” I know he keeps implying it, but I want to hear him say it.\\n\\n “Like is putting it mildly.”\\n\\n I smile against his neck as he carries me out of the shower and places me on the bathroom counter. He grabs a towel and dries both of us off before wrapping the towel around his waist, hiding his very obvious erection from me. It’s then I remember he didn’t get off in the shower, too. I want to make him feel as good as he did me.\\n\\n “Let me take care of you.” I can’t look at him when I say the words, but I reach for the towel. He stops me, grabbing my wrist with one hand and putting his finger under my chin to make me look up at him.\\n\\n “You already did. But my cock just can’t seem to go down when you’re naked. Hell, when you\u0027re breathing.”\\n\\n “But…” I don’t understand what he means.\\n\\n Releasing my wrist, he takes a step towards me, crowding me on the counter. He makes no move to touch me, but he places his hands on either side of me, caging me in. His smell invades my senses, making it hard to think.\\n\\n “Oh, I came eating your sweet cunt.” He leans in a little more, his mouth just a breath from mine. “My woman is so fucking sexy and tastes so fucking good, I came just from eating her pussy.”\\n\\n His words send a rush of desire through me, making my vagina clench.\\n\\n “Oh, Jesus.”\\n\\n “I’m never going to get enough of you. Never going to let you go.” His eyes are so intense, I believe him. I should be running because of how fast this is happening, but all I can do is close the sliver of distance between our mouths, my fingers latching behind his neck, never wanting to let go.\\n\\n The kiss goes on and on before Sean finally pulls away.\\n\\n “Got to stop, baby. I want you again, and I want to get you fed and give your pussy a little rest.”\\n\\n “Mmkay,” is all I can say, still in the kiss fog.\\n\\n He grabs my hips, pulling me off the counter before leading me back towards his room and over to a closet. He pulls out some clothes and hands me a dress.\\n\\n I pause. He has a dress in his closet? What the heck? I want to say something, but I stay motionless as he grabs himself something. When he turns around and sees my expression, he rushes to explain. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-23.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
