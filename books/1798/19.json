Reaching over my head, I grab the collar of my shirt and pull it up and off, giving her what she asked for. Her sharp inhalation makes me want to puff out my chest. She wiggles around, still rubbing her hands all over me. I need to get her under the covers and asleep before I have her legs over my shoulders, with me in between them. I won’t risk her not remembering our first time together. I want her to remember every detail of it. I want to hook her into me and show her all the ways I can please her. I want to give her what she needs. I reach down and tug at her dress again. “I hate this fucking thing.” “You don’t like it? I thought I looked sexy for once.” She pouts up at me, her bottom lip sticking out, making me want to bite it. “You\u0027re always sexy.” I grab the top of the dress and do as she suggested. I rip it. “But I don’t like other people seeing you with so few clothes on.” She gasps as the material easily comes apart in my hands, leaving her in just her panties. I throw the dress behind me, not caring where it lands. “Holy shit, that was hot. Can we do it again?” Her wide eyes are filled with excitement. “You got another dress around here I don’t know about?” I tease her. She just shakes her head, that happy excited look still pasted across her face. “I’ll buy you more and rip them off you if you really want me to, but you only wear them in the house.” No way is she ever going out dressed like that again. I’d end up doing life in prison. “I’ll wear whatever I want.” She thrusts her chin up smugly, but it’s too adorable to be threatening. I have no idea how someone can be smug and adorable all at once, but she’s doing it, and I just smile at her as I try not to laugh. “You want me to walk around in public without a shirt on?” Her fingers, which were busily trailing my chest, following the lines of my tattoos, stop and dig into me in a possessive manner. It makes my cock jerk, and I fucking love the feeling. She glares at me. “No need for that, little fox. It’s all yours. I’m just showing you how it makes me feel.” I grab the blanket and pull it over her. Hiding her body from me. It takes everything in me not to look at it, but I know my control would probably shatter if I did. “I’m going to get you some water and something to stop your headache before it starts.” I pull myself from the bed and make my way towards the kitchen to grab a bottle of water and a few pills for her. When I turn around, I nearly trip over her. She’s standing in the middle of my kitchen with just her panties on. “I thought you were going to ruin me.” She says it so matter-of-factly, no shyness at all. She pushes her body up against me, her naked chest hitting mine. Her curves melt into me. Reaching up, she locks her arms around my neck, and I have to bend a little for her to reach, even though she’s on her tiptoes. All control snaps. My hands go to her face, dropping the water bottle and pills, letting them hit the floor as I take her mouth. Her sweetness hits my lips, and the taste of her reminds me how desperate I am for her. It’s like being trapped in the desert for weeks and finally having water. I can’t stop myself from wanting to drink her down. One sip will never be enough. Thrusting my tongue into her mouth, I try to devour her. I never knew lips could be so soft. They yield to me just like all of her curves. Her body wiggles against mine, her moan filling my mouth. Fuck. I let go of her face and grab her hips, easily lifting her to me. Her legs wrap around my waist. Before I know what I’m doing, I have her back in my bed without having broken the kiss. I’ve somehow got my pants and underwear off, and my naked cock is pressed against her sheathed pussy. When I realize what I’ve done, that I’ve taken it too far, I pull back and rest my forehead against hers. Get it under control, Sparrow. You can have her in the morning. “Please.” She moves her hips against me. Her warm pussy rubs my cock, testing every bit of control I have. I feel cum leak out the tip, and I have to bite the inside of my mouth to stop myself from cumming. No way would I cum before her. “I’ll give you what you need, little fox. Then you’ll go to sleep like a good girl.” “Just do it. Take me. I’ve been thinking about it all day. Come morning I’ll be too shy to ask.” She moves against me more. I know she’s right. In the morning she will be too shy to ask, but I won’t let her pull away. I’ll bulldoze right through all those walls she might try to erect. Any self-doubt she might have, I’ll shatter. “You won’t have to ask. I’ll always give you what you need.” I pull back from her a little so I have room to slide one of my hands between us. I dip one finger into her underwear, going straight for her clit, not wanting to draw it out. I know what she needs, and I’m going to give her that. I won’t leave her in need, but I’m only willing to give her this tonight. Tomorrow she’ll get it all. Her hips rise and moans pour from her lips when I touch her there. She’s fucking soaked. Dropping my head down to one of her big tits, I take her nipple into my mouth and suck. I stroke my finger where she needs it the most, and she instantly cums. Her whole body jerks, and when my name leaves her lips, I find myself cumming on her. Fuck. I can’t believe she went off for me like that. I didn’t think anything could be hotter than that. A simple touch from me sent her over the edge. It gives me hope. I continue to suck her nipple and work my finger on her clit, milking her orgasm for her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-19.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
