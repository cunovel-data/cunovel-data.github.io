When I go back to the bed, I sit on the edge and start to wipe away the make-up on her eyes. She’s got so much on, she doesn’t look like my Tessa.\n After a few swipes, it’s mostly gone, and I can see the fresh-faced beauty I’ve been craving. She looks so perfect here in my bed.\n Leaning down, I place one soft kiss on her cheek, wanting more, but not able to let myself take advantage of her. No, when I take her for the first time, I want her looking into my eyes and begging me for more.\n As I lean back and look down at her, she whispers my name as she falls asleep.\n Now all I’ve got to do is take her clothes off like a gentleman and keep my hands to myself. Shouldn’t be too difficult, right?\n Chapter 10\n Sean\n I give the dress a little tug and it does nothing at all. Trying a little harder, I yank with a little more force, making her big honey eyes pop open at me. I expect her to maybe jump or wonder where she is, but she just smiles at me. Trusting. A trust I’m going to shatter, but I’m going to enjoy it while I still have it. Soak up as much of it as I can. Hold on to each sweet moment.\n “Harder.” Her voice is husky, and I growl at the simple word. I know she means yank on the dress harder, but all I can picture is her below me as I thrust my cock into her virgin-tight pussy while she begs me to fuck her harder. To give her something only I can. Telling me I’m the only man she’ll ever let have her. That she’ll be mine forever.\n She licks her lips and a sweet little giggle pops out of her mouth as she catches what she said. Her little giggle alone makes my cock ache with need. Fuck having blue balls, I’m going to have a fucking blue body. I don’t just want to fuck her. I want to rub every part of me all over her.\n “Come on, handsome. I’m sure you rip clothes off women all the time.” She reaches up and her finger traces the hair along my jaw before she grabs a handful off it. Yeah, I’m never shaving again; I like her grabbing onto me like that.\n “I don’t recall ever ripping clothing off of a woman before,” I admit. Fuck, I can’t even remember the last time I’d been with a woman, let alone who it was. When I was younger and just started getting my hands dirty, I played, but as time went on I quit that shit fast.\n I don’t think I’m cocky when it comes to my looks, but I know I attract a lot of female attention. Add that to the fact that I don’t treat women like shit like a lot of the men do in the places I hang out. Women would get attached to me, and then I’d still end up hurting them. That was something I took no pleasure in. I’ve been keeping to myself since, focusing instead on stacking my bank account. My hand did the job just fine when I needed the release, and that approach came with fewer problems.\n I’d always wanted to settle down one day, but I knew I had to get my hands clean. That was something I planned to do after this score, but sweet little Tessa stumbled into my life a few weeks before I was ready. She fell right into my path, and there’s no turning around now. The goal is still the same, there are just a few added parts to it now. And the end goal is bigger and better than I could have ever dreamed of. No, I didn\u0027t think perfection and sweet innocence like her even existed.\n “Oh, I can be your first.” She wiggles her eyebrows. “You can be my first, too.” She parts her legs, and I can’t stop myself from looking as she shows her simple white underwear. I thought maybe having too many meetings in the back of strip clubs had jaded me. I’ve seen women in what’s supposed to be the sexiest lingerie, but the sight of her in simple white panties has me wanting to cum in my pants.\n I know the truth, though. It’s not about what she’s wearing. It’s her. Everything about her seems to do this to me. This little curvy slip of a girl can turn me inside out without even trying. No games or batting her eyelashes coyly at me. It’s simply her. Everything about her just does it for me. She’s utterly perfect. Like she’s made for me. Made to drive me utterly crazy.\n “I’d be your first what?” I bait her, wanting to hear her say it. She parts her legs a little more, showing me her panty-covered pussy.\n “Everything. Go ahead. Ruin me.” She giggles again, and I’m not sure what to make of her comment.\n Ruin her. I like and hate the idea all at once.\n “I’d never ruin you.” Make her want only me? Fuck yes. But ruin her? Never. It already kills me that I might jade her a little. She’s so trusting and sweet. I’d hate for her to lose that. I hate that I might be the one to make her lose that.\n If only I’d met her another way. She could have kept all the innocent trust she has because she’d have me to protect her and to shield her from everything that could shatter it. Make sure nothing touched her so she could keep it.\n Her hand drops from my face and runs down my chest. I lean into her hand, liking her touch.\n “Oh, I’m sure you’d ruin me. I think I could cum just looking at you.” She keeps running her hand over my chest and brings her other hand up to join in. Fucking hell, she’s so cute when she’s drunk. Gone is the shy girl, and in her place is someone who doesn’t think before she speaks, and I love it. I love the shy blush that hits her cheeks, but I enjoy this just as much.\n “What if I told you that you’d already ruined me?”\n “Liar. Take off your shirt. I want to see how far those tattoos go.” She’s changing the subject, even when she doesn’t realize she’s doing it. My girl seems to have a problem with thinking she isn’t hot or some shit, but we’ll work on that over time. She’ll soon see how fucking serious I am about us. She won’t have a doubt her in mind about the lengths I’ll go to to have her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-18.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
