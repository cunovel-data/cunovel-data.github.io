It only takes a few moments before she’s totally relaxed and taking me all the way to the base of my cock. My balls press against her sticky pussy, and I feel her warm sugary syrup coating them.\\n\\n I hold my cock in her ass for a few seconds. I want to enjoy the feeling of being in her ass. “I won’t cum, but I need to know that I’ve claimed it as mine. Every part of you.”\\n\\n I push into her before pulling out slowly, then push in one final time. I will always prefer the warm welcome of her wet cunt, but I just needed to have this hole, too.\\n\\n Pulling out slowly again for the final time, I leave the tightness of her ass and rub my palm over her asshole and pussy, gently petting the soreness away.\\n\\n “Let’s take a shower, baby.” I kiss her back and pull her with me into the shower, letting the hot water and bubbly soap wash us clean.\\n\\n Once we’re clean, I carry Tessa out of the shower and dry her off. I grab a simple cover-up for her and some loose shorts for me. We dress and walk down to the part of the island that’s shaded.\\n\\n There’s a big cabana on this side of the island, which gives us privacy, but also a perfect view of the sunset. It’s got a cover over the top and long silky panels that allow us to remain unseen, yet it still feels like we’re outside.\\n\\n I hold her to me as we lie in the cabana and watch the sun set. The peaceful calm between us is all we need. I steal little kisses and touches as we silently hold one another, just enjoying our perfect little paradise.\\n\\n It’s then time for dinner, so I scooping Tessa up and carry her on the path back to the house. When we get to the dining room, I place her in the seat beside me and sit down next to her.\\n\\n “Are you always going to carry me like that?” She looks at me with her big golden eyes filled with love and happiness.\\n\\n “Yes, Tessa. I will carry you, love you, spoil you, adore you, and worship you for the rest of my life.”\\n\\n A blush hits her sun-kissed cheeks, and I lean down to place my lips on them.\\n\\n It’s amazing what we’ve been through and how far we’ve come in such a short time. People would probably consider us crazy, but if they felt even a tenth of what I feel for her, they would understand. I can’t put into words exactly what she means to me, so I just have to keep showing her, over and over. If that’s what it takes to show her what I feel inside, then I’ll gladly do it.\\n\\n Pushing a stray hair out of her eyes, I look at her and think how impossibly insane it is that I found her. That all my hopes, dreams, wishes, and love can be wrapped up in one person. I never intended for my life to end up this way, but it’s more perfect than I could have imagined.\\n\\n I started out as the thief, but Tessa stole my heart.\\n\\n Epilogue\\n\\n Tessa\\n\\n 3 months later …\\n\\n “I’m going to have to start running an extra two miles a day if Marie keeps this up.”\\n\\n Sean stands up from the little table in the kitchen. He raises his shirt to rub his belly as he smirks at me.\\n\\n I have to agree. If we keep eating like this, I might have to join him. And I don’t run. Ever. Unless something is chasing me, and that only happens when Sean and I are playing around. Though once I did suggest going with him. He said no, then made me ride him while he gripped my hips in a firm hold to remind me how much he liked them and how he didn’t want them going anywhere. Needless to say, he didn’t run that day either.\\n\\n Reaching over, I grab a few of the hairs on his stomach and pull, making him yelp and jump back from me. I giggle. “See how she treats me, Marie?” He leans down, placing one hand on the table and the other on the back of my chair, caging me in. He kisses me softly on the lips.\\n\\n “Missed a little,” he whispers against my lips, licking any syrup that might be remaining.\\n\\n “I see how she treats you alright.” Marie’s tone makes me blush.\\n\\n Marie started working on the island about six weeks ago. She used to come each day on a boat until Sal finally talked her into staying with him permanently. Watching them together is utterly adorable, and I wonder if people look at Sean and me like that.\\n\\n Giving me another quick kiss, Sean picks up my plate and his own to take to the sink, but Marie stops him and pulls them from his hands.\\n\\n “That’s my job,” she scolds him. I can’t see Sean’s face, but I’m sure he’s scowling at her. This has no effect on her, though he’s probably a whole foot and a half taller than her. She’s the definition of a spitfire if you get her going. I love that about her and have even picked up a few of her tricks. Sean and Sal both tried to get her to quit working here, saying she didn’t need to work. She’s Sal’s woman, but she says she loves doing it. She needs something to do or she’ll go stir crazy. They still ended up hiring another woman to help out, and the battle of wills is still going strong.\\n\\n He makes his way back to me and crouches so we’re at eye level. “You sure you don’t want to come with me? I’ll be quick. It won’t take me long at all to make sure everything is in line.”\\n\\n “No, it’s fine. I’m just going to lie down for a little. I bet by the time I wake up, you’ll be back.” Sean likes to go to town once a month to pick up a few things, check his mail, and look in on his accounts. I went with him the last time and enjoyed myself, but today I have something I need to take care of.\\n\\n “How about I put it off, and we’ll go tomorrow when you’re feeling better?” I can see the concern written all over his face. I lied this morning and told him I had a headache to get out of going today. Sometimes this man handles me like glass. I wonder how he’ll be once he gets me knocked up. “I could nap with you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-42.html","bookId":1798,"book":{"id":1798,"title":"Thief (Breeding #3)","description":"Storyline: Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out.
