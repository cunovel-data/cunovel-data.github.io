{"id":11279,"no":8,"title":"THE YOUTH’S DREAM.","content":"“I HAVE dreamed a dream of a future time, Of a scepter and a crown, For the sheaves of wheat and the moon and stars In my dream to me bow down.” ’Twas a vision true, as the future proved, For the boy, once sold a slave, By a faithful life rose to princely power, And the world its homage gave. Have you dreamed a dream of a future time, Of a fortune and a name? Of success and honor and love and joy, And at last undying fame? If your dream comes true you must toil and strive With a purpose strong and pure, For the kingly heart and the godly life Wins a crown that shall endure. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794/77311.html","bookId":1289,"book":{"id":1289,"title":"A Little Colored Boy and Other Stories","description":"简介： I think it more likely that God put an angels voice in Neddys throat to give us a taste of heavenly music, said grandma, looking up from the apples she was paring....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
