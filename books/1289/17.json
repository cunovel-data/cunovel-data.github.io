For some one had said, she whispered to me, With her face on my shoulder hid, Some one had said (there were sobs in her voice) That they didn’t like something she did. So I took my little girl up on my knee— I am old and exceedingly wise— And I said, “My dear, now listen to me; Just listen and dry your eyes. “This world is a difficult world, indeed, And people are hard to suit, And the man who plays on the violin Is a bore to the man with the flute. “And I myself have often thought How very much better ’twould be, If every one of the folks that I know Would only agree with me. “But, since they will not, the very best way To make this world look bright Is never to mind what the people say, But to do what you think is right.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794/77320.html","bookId":1289,"book":{"id":1289,"title":"A Little Colored Boy and Other Stories","description":"简介： I think it more likely that God put an angels voice in Neddys throat to give us a taste of heavenly music, said grandma, looking up from the apples she was paring....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
