Why, there he is again,” she exclaimed, as he reappeared almost at once; “I suppose she wasn’t at home.” When little Ada, aged three, had been told the story of Lot’s wife being turned into a pillar of salt she asked her mother, anxiously, “Is all salt made of ladies?” Later, when six years old, she was called one Sunday, “Come, Ada, and learn your catechism;” whereupon she answered roguishly, “If it’s for me, it ought to be a kittychism!” Cyril was seven years old. He loved his mother very dearly, and had been separated from her sometimes, as she had to go to India. Once when she came to wish him “good-night” he was under the bed-clothes. He came out with a flushed little face, and said, as he hugged her tight: “Mummie, do you know what I was doing? I was asking God to love you as much as I do. He couldn’t love you more.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794/77321.html","bookId":1289,"book":{"id":1289,"title":"A Little Colored Boy and Other Stories","description":"简介： I think it more likely that God put an angels voice in Neddys throat to give us a taste of heavenly music, said grandma, looking up from the apples she was paring....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
