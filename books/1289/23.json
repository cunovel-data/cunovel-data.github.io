One day her brother Will and his friend Tom were telling how a big dog chased a cat, and nearly frightened her to death, when Cissy cried out, “O, what a bad, bad dog! what made him want to hurt kitty?” “Why, we told him to; he isn’t a bad dog,” said Will. Then Cissy’s cheeks grew red and her eyes flashed as she said, “You is bad boys; what for you want kitty hurted? God don’t want kitties to be hurted;” and then the little preacher broke down and sobbed out the rest on mamma’s shoulder. Will and Tom both got red in the face and pretty soon walked off; but they did not soon forget the lesson Cissy taught them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794/77326.html","bookId":1289,"book":{"id":1289,"title":"A Little Colored Boy and Other Stories","description":"简介： I think it more likely that God put an angels voice in Neddys throat to give us a taste of heavenly music, said grandma, looking up from the apples she was paring....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2794","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:48 AM"}}
