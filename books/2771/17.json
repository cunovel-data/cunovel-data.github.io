{"id":86607,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"This should be about the time I tell the cop the truth: that I\u0027m in Hampton by the order of the Illinois Juvenile Department of Corrections. But I won\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Got it,\" Vic says.\\n\\n The officer gets back in his squad car and orders Vic and his friends to move on. He follows Vic\u0027s car. I watch until both cars are out of sight.\\n\\n When I look around for my backpack, I quickly realize it\u0027s gone. One of Vic\u0027s friends probably snatched it. But that\u0027s the least of my worries.\\n\\n My jaw is starting to protest Vic\u0027s punch, and I put my hand up to my face to feel if it\u0027s bleeding. When I do, Maggie reveals herself.\\n\\n Our eyes lock.\\n\\n The bus to Paradise comes rumbling down the street and we both get on it. I sit at my usual spot in back and she follows, sitting right next to me. I\u0027m surprised until I notice her fingers shaking.\\n\\n She\u0027s scared.\\n\\n It\u0027s demented and strange after all that\u0027s happened, but she feels safe with me right now. I don\u0027t dare touch her, \u0027cause that would mean this is something more than it is. And I know this ... this feeling of friendship is a fleeting, temporary thing. What scares me to fucking death is that some part of my brain has decided this insignificant act of Maggie sitting next to me is the first step in fixing all that\u0027s gone wrong in my life.\\n\\n Which makes it all the more significant.\\n\\n TWENTY-FOUR\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n I saw Caleb today at school. Rumors are running rampant about the bruises on his face. None of the rumors are true.\\n\\n After school I get on the bus to go to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. I walk down the aisle to where Caleb is sitting. He doesn\u0027t look up. I take the seat next to him like I did yesterday.\\n\\n This time he doesn\u0027t walk behind me after we\u0027re dropped off at the bus stop by Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. We walk side by side, as if there\u0027s an unspoken understanding between the two of us. I\u0027m the only one (besides Vic and his thug friends) who knows how Caleb got his bruises. The fight yesterday scared me. Did Caleb get caught up in the fight because Vic insulted me? Whatever the reasons were, it was us against them. Caleb and I were on the same team and we didn\u0027t have a chance of winning.\\n\\n That\u0027s why I ran behind a tree and called 911 from my cell, to protect him/us, because he would never be able to fight off three guys by himself, and God knows my cheap book bag couldn\u0027t take much more. I\u0027ve never been able to stomach a fight anyway. The fight is over, but its aftereffects have lingered.\\n\\n So now it\u0027s another day at Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house working together, but not.\\n\\n Caleb still follows my conditions: he doesn\u0027t talk to me as he works on the gazebo and I plant more daffodils.\\n\\n I hum songs as I work. Sometimes Mrs. Reynolds hums along with me, until she starts belting out words to the songs so loud that I stop working and blink my eyes at this old lady who doesn\u0027t care what people think about her. It\u0027s really mind-boggling.\\n\\n When Mrs. Reynolds starts nodding off, I walk inside the house and pour myself a glass of water. Before I leave the kitchen, I pour one for Caleb too. Quietly, I set it down on one of the wooden planks beside him.\\n\\n Heading back inside to prepare a small snack, I remember I forgot to bring the cookie plate down from the attic last week. I go up the two flights of stairs to the attic and pick up the plate.\\n\\n The door closes and I shriek. Caleb is standing in the attic with me, the glass of water in his hand. \"Oh my God!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you, Maggie. I just wanted to say thanks for the water and ... well, and I know it\u0027s not easy working together, but I do appreciate you not kicking me out.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t leave,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because that door locks automatically.\"\\n\\n Caleb eyes the door stopper he just kicked out of the way. \"You\u0027re joking, right?\"\\n\\n I shake my head slowly. I\u0027m trying not to panic at the reality of being stuck with Caleb Becker in an attic. Breathe, Maggie. In. Out. In. Out.\\n\\n Caleb tries turning the knob, then tries a turn-door-knob-while-pushing-on-door action. \"Shit.\" He turns to me. \"You and me. In the same room. This is not supposed to happen.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I say.\\n\\n \"We could yell for Mrs. Reynolds. She\u0027s sleeping outside, but--\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll never hear us all the way out there. Her hearing is marginal if you\u0027re ten feet away. When she wakes up we\u0027ll hear her and then yell our heads off.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re saying we\u0027re stuck here?\"\\n\\n I nod again.\\n\\n \"Shit.\"\\n\\n \"You already said that,\" I inform him. Caleb starts pacing while running his hands over his buzz cut. \"Yeah, well, this sucks. Being locked up is getting to be the theme of my life,\" he mumbles. \"How long before she usually wakes up?\"\\n\\n I shrug. \"It could be a half hour, but sometimes she sleeps for an hour or more, like yesterday.\"\\n\\n Taking a deep breath, he sits in the middle of the floor and leans against Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 trunk. \"You might as well take a seat,\" he says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m kind of afraid of spiders.\"\\n\\n \"Still?\"\\n\\n \"You remember that about me?\"\\n\\n \"How could I forget? You and Leah used to make me your personal spider killer,\" he says. I look at him strangely.\\n\\n \"Sit,\" he orders. \"I\u0027m giving the old lady two hours to free us and then I\u0027m breaking that door down.\"\\n\\n Neither of us say anything for a long time. The only sound is our breathing and the eerie bangs and creaks of the old house.\\n\\n \"Was it scary in jail?\" I ask, breaking the silence.\\n\\n \"Sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Like when? What did they do to you?\"\\n\\n I turn and look at him. His expression is wary. \"You know, you\u0027re the first one who\u0027s asked for details.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll admit I\u0027ve heard the rumors. I suspect most of them aren\u0027t true.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027d you hear?\"\\n\\n I curl my lip, nervous to be the one to tell him. \"Let\u0027s see ... you had a boyfriend in jail... you joined a gang... you attempted to escape and got solitary confinement ... you beat up a guy who afterward needed to be hospitalized ... should I continue?\"\\n\\n \"You believe any of it?\"\\n\\n \"No. Why? Are they true?\"\\n\\n He leans his head back against the trunk and lets out a long breath. \"I was in a fight and got thrown in solitary for it.\" He puts his palms over his eyes. \"I was in solitary for thirty-six hours. God, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m talking to you, of all people, about this.\"\\n\\n \"Did they give you food and water?\"\\n\\n He laughs. \"Yeah, you still get meals. But you\u0027re sleeping on a slab of cement and a one-inch foam mattress on top of that. A stainless steel toilet is your only companion.\"\\n\\n \"At least you were alone,\" I say. \"I had to wait for someone to bring a plastic bowl for me to go to the bathroom while I was in the hospital. Then I had to lay there while they wiped me. It was so degrading.\"\\n\\n \"Do the doctors say you\u0027ll ever walk without a limp?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t know. I have to go to physical therapy twice a week until I go to Spain.\"\\n\\n \"Spain?\"\\n\\n I explain why I\u0027m working at Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house every day and about my dream of leaving Paradise so I can get away from the past.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t wait to get back home,\" he admits. \"Coming back here meant I was free of being locked up.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re Caleb Becker. People will always accept you. The only thing that kept me from being a loser before was tennis and Leah. Now that I\u0027ve lost both, I have nothing except humiliating stares and comments people say but don\u0027t think I hear.\"\\n\\n Caleb stands and paces the attic again. \"Coming home has sucked. But leaving Paradise would be a copout.\"\\n\\n \"To me,\" I tell him, \"leaving Paradise means freedom. I feel locked up just living in this town where everybody reminds me what a loser I am now.\"\\n\\n Caleb crouches down, his face right in front of mine. \"You are not a loser. Hell, Maggie, you always knew what you wanted and went for it.\"\\n\\n I tell him the honest truth. \"Not anymore. When you hit me, a part of me died.\"\\n\\n TWENTY-FIVE\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n \"Caleb, phone!\" Mom yells from the kitchen.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been in my room, trying to figure out these mixed-up thoughts I\u0027ve been having since Tuesday, when Maggie and I got locked in the attic. We sat there for maybe forty minutes. In that short amount of time I probably shared more with her than I have with Kendra. Ever.\\n\\n I\u0027m in serious trouble here.\\n\\n I pick up the cordless and head to my room. \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, CB. It\u0027s Brian.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Sunday,\" Brian says in a way-too-cheery tone.\\n\\n \"And?\" I say.\\n\\n \"Come on, dude, don\u0027t tell me you forgot our ritual. You, me, Drew, and Tristan ...\"\\n\\n I remember. Sunday afternoons watching football-- me, Brian, Tristan, and Drew. No chicks allowed was our motto.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving for Tristan\u0027s in ten. Be ready,\" Brian says, then the line goes dead.\\n\\n I\u0027m in my briefs. I\u0027d sworn to myself I\u0027d sleep all day. But if I want to get back into a normal routine, Sunday football can\u0027t be ignored.\\n\\n I take a quick shower--believe me I\u0027m used to them. And when I\u0027m pulling on some old sweats and a t-shirt, I hear Mom downstairs fawning over Brian.\\n\\n I\u0027m so glad you called Caleb. You\u0027re such a good friend. Here\u0027s some leftover Chinese food from last night. I swear she\u0027s like an out-of-control machine.\\n\\n When I get downstairs, Brian says to me, \"Your mom rocks, CB. Check out all the stuff she packed for us.\"\\n\\n I glance into the large grocery bag. Mom must have put half of the food from our refrigerator in it. I\u0027m about to hug her, but she picks up a dish rag and starts wiping off the kitchen table when I come close. \"Go on,\" she says, \"and have a good time.\"\\n\\n At Tristan\u0027s house we have to wait for the game to come on. It\u0027s the Packers against the Bears. Before I got arrested, I could have told you every date of every game and every Bears\u0027 opponent playing in those games.\\n\\n I park myself on the couch in his basement and lean back. I can hardly wait to watch. The other guys have no clue how much I missed this.\\n\\n Hell, I didn\u0027t even realize how much I missed this.\\n\\n I got Kendra back, I got my friends back. I\u0027ve got to forget about Maggie. I\u0027m sure I\u0027m just thinking about her so much because we\u0027re working together. I came back to Paradise with a mission to get my life back to normal. Sitting back and watching the game makes me realize that the status quo isn\u0027t all that bad.\\n\\n Until Tristan starts tossing cans of Michelob to each of us.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you get the brew?\" Drew asks.\\n\\n \"From the Fourth of July. I snatched a case from my parents\u0027 party and hid it. My mom didn\u0027t even know it was missing.\"\\n\\n \"Way to go, man,\" Brian says. \"Toss one of those puppies over here.\"\\n\\n Brian and Drew catch theirs and open them right away. I catch the one thrown to me. Tristan holds his can up. \"To a new season of Bears ball.\"\\n\\n \"To a quarterback who can actually throw the ball,\" Brian says.\\n\\n \"And a running back that can actually run the ball,\" Drew offers.\\n\\n They all turn to me, waiting for my dumb football wisdom.\\n\\n I\u0027m holding the can, the coldness against my palm sending a chill up my arm. \"And a punter who could kick the ball,\" I add, wondering if they realize I haven\u0027t flipped the top and opened it yet.\\n\\n They all take a swig. Except me. I may have jeopardized going back to jail when I got in a fight with Vic when he insulted Maggie, but that was worth the risk. I haven\u0027t even been near alcohol since the night of the accident. I\u0027m not about to jeopardize going back for a stupid can of beer. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-17.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \\n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
