{"id":86594,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I guess now wouldn\u0027t be the best time to talk about how much I miss my ex-best friend who also happens to be \"one of those Beckers.\" A car horn beeps outside. It\u0027s Sabrina.\n \"Go,\" Mom says. \"And call when you get there so I know you\u0027re safe, even if you think I\u0027m being overprotective or uncool.\"\n I walk out the door, trying to count the days in my head until I leave for Spain. I think it\u0027s a hundred and eighteen days, obviously not soon enough. When I get in the front seat of my cousin\u0027s car, she says, \"Nice outfit.\"\n Sabrina knows well enough that we struggle financially and my clothes are an extravagant expense we can\u0027t afford. Two years ago my dad left on a business trip to Texas. It was supposed to be for four weeks, he was trying to convince a group of investors to move their digital-chip manufacturing facility to Paradise. They rejected his proposal, but they offered him a job traveling around the country as their consultant.\n In two years my dad has been back to Paradise three times. Once to ask my mom for a divorce, once to announce he\u0027s getting remarried, and the last time was after the accident. He came for one week, then left. He says he\u0027s happy, that he wants me to come visit his new home, but he never makes any commitments or sets up any dates. I wasn\u0027t even at his second wedding.\n \"Thanks.\" I run my fingers over the soft pants one more time.\n And that\u0027s our entire conversation until Sabrina parks on the street and we walk toward Brian Newcomb\u0027s house.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Sabrina asks. \"You\u0027re limping worse than usual. I thought your leg was better.\"\n \"It was ... it is.\" But a spasm reared its ugly head today.\n I hear rock music blaring out of the windows of Brian\u0027s house and take a deep breath. There\u0027s going to be dancing. Dancing involves moving around and bumping into people. What if I fall? Worse, what if I can\u0027t get up and people start laughing?\n At the front of the house, I\u0027m ready to hightail it back home and hide out in my bedroom until I leave for Spain. But Sabrina eagerly opens the door before I can retreat.\n As we enter the foyer, I\u0027m hypersensitive and aware all eyes are focused on me. A chill runs down my spine. Could it be I have a zit the size of an avocado pit growing on my nose? Is my limp that bad? Or is it gossip they crave? Either way, I don\u0027t like the attention. I\u0027d just about do anything to remain lost in the background forever.\n \"Hey, guys, it\u0027s Maggie Armstrong back from the dead!\" yells a guy on the football team.\n \"I heard Caleb Becker is back, too,\" a guy named Ty calls out.\n \"That\u0027s what I hear,\" I say glibly, not feeling at all glib. I can\u0027t hide. Do they know I want to? \"It\u0027s no biggie.\" I\u0027m surprised that I\u0027m able to get the words out; my throat is threatening to close up.\n \"But he almost killed you,\" someone else says. I don\u0027t even know who said it; the crowd has become one big blur. I don\u0027t even think I could take a deep breath now if I wanted to.\n \"It was a year ago. I\u0027m over it.\" Gulp. Being brave is not as easy as it looks. Especially when your heart is racing faster than the beat of the music, which has now faded into the background. Lucky music.\n \"How can you be? Weren\u0027t you in a wheelchair for, like, four months?\"\n One hundred and twenty-three days to be exact, but who\u0027s counting? \"I guess.\"\n \"People, give her room to breathe.\" I turn to the voice. It\u0027s Kendra. Caleb\u0027s old girlfriend. We used to hang in the same circles, but we were never close. She reminds me of a fake, plastic doll. To my surprise she grabs my arm and pulls me out on the back patio. With my limp it\u0027s hard to keep up with her without tripping over my own feet, but she doesn\u0027t seem to notice. Or care.\n \"Have you seen him?\" she asks in a whisper.\n For a second I\u0027m confused. Kendra is popular, someone nobody can ignore. But I\u0027m not really here, am I? Sure, my body is. But my serenity is back at home, in my room where I can hide from the past and reminders of the accident.\n Kendra shakes me, and I\u0027m back at the party.\n \"Did you see him?\" she asks. The way she looks at me you\u0027d think her eyes were darts.\n \"Who?\"\n She\u0027s annoyed, her curly blonde hair bouncing with each movement of her head, emphasizing her mood like exclamation points. \"Caleb.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"But he lives right next door to you,\" she says almost desperately, those darts narrowing into little slits.\n \"So?\" Okay, so I never did particularly click with Kendra. She knows it, I know it. Not many others know it; we\u0027d been very good at pretending we were on the same page. It feels like a standoff, her challenging me for information she wants and thinks I have. But I don\u0027t have it, so I don\u0027t even have the satisfaction of holding back information from her.\n Brian peeks his head out the screen door. \"Kendra, what\u0027re you doing out here? Come in and save me from having to play spin-the-bottle.\"\n Kendra looks from me to Brian, then back. \"I\u0027m coming,\" she says, tossing her hair once again with a flick of her head, before entering the house. I\u0027m left alone. Outside.\n I\u0027m fine with alone. I\u0027m used to alone. Alone is comfortable for me, it\u0027s quiet and doesn\u0027t demand I be happy or satisfied or ... asked any questions. I try not to think about what it was like when I wasn\u0027t alone, when I was an integral part of the social scene. When Kendra and I weren\u0027t enemies or friends, but hung with the same people. And even if we weren\u0027t socially equal, then at least we were on the same social playing field.\n Get-togethers wouldn\u0027t have been the same without me.\n Now it\u0027s not the same with me.\n I sit on a lounge chair by the pool. A few minutes later the party has multiplied and people start congregating and dancing on the patio. I am still alone, but within the crowd.\n Brianne is hanging onto Drew Wentworth, Paradise High\u0027s varsity quarterback. His hands are all over her as they dance close to a slow song blaring from the second-story window.\n Danielle and Sabrina are huddled in a corner, gossiping and giggling. After a while some guys pull them onto the patio and start dancing with them. The scene reminds me of those California teen reality shows. I stick out like a sore thumb wearing a pink Juicy Couture outfit. I open my purse, glance at the emergency numbers my mom gave me just to make sure they\u0027re still there, then close my purse back up. Surely becoming an outcast when you were previously popular isn\u0027t considered an emergency, is it?\n Kendra and Brian start putting on their own public dance show right on the diving board after changing into bathing suits. Everyone gathers around, chanting for the couple to jump in. Kendra loves the attention, she\u0027s used to it. Her family has owned the biggest parcel of land in Paradise for the past two hundred years. Her dad has been the mayor for the past ten years, and her grandfather was the mayor before that. Some girls are born to have it all.\n Soon a bunch of other seniors come out of the house wearing bathing suits. Danielle walks over to me. \"Did you bring a suit? Sabrina and I are going to change in Brian\u0027s room.\"\n If I came out wearing a bathing suit showing all my scars, I\u0027d probably clear the place out. \"My doctor says I can\u0027t swim yet,\" I lie.\n \"Oh, sorry. I didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"No problem,\" I say, pulling out the cell.\n While Danielle and Sabrina run up the stairs, I hobble out the door and dial the number to my mom\u0027s work.\n \"Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner. Can I help you?\"\n \"Hey, Mom, it\u0027s me.\"\n \"Are you okay?\" she asks.\n \"I\u0027m fine. Having a blast,\" I say as I limp away from Brian\u0027s house and start walking down the street. I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m going. Someplace private ... quiet ... where I don\u0027t have to think about what I\u0027m missing. A place I can close my eyes and focus on my future.\n A future without Paradise.\n I can imagine the smile on my mom\u0027s face as she says, \"See ... and you were worried you wouldn\u0027t fit in. Don\u0027t you feel silly now?\"\n \"Absolutely.\" The truth? I feel absolutely silly that I have to lie to my mom.\n FIVE\n Caleb\n I\u0027m keeping a permanent smile on my face at my mom\u0027s welcome-home party for me, just like my dad ordered. It\u0027s a fake smile, but my mom\u0027s friends seem to be buying it. I think.\n My mom has been all over me, laughing and hugging me in public as I play the reformed son. I wonder how long I can keep up this farce before I can\u0027t take it anymore. Forget me, how long can she keep it up? Dad doesn\u0027t even seem to notice her Jekyll and Hyde transformation. Why do appearances matter so much to my parents?\n \"Caleb has become religious while he\u0027s been away,\" Mom tells Mrs. Gutterman as she grabs my elbow and makes me face the reverend\u0027s wife. \"Isn\u0027t that right, Caleb?\" she says.\n \"I prayed every day,\" I say, not missing a beat, and knowing it\u0027s not only Mrs. Gutterman who\u0027s listening. The truth? I prayed every day that I\u0027d survive the juvenile system, come back to Paradise, and make things right again. Mom\u0027s declaration that I\u0027ve become religious is hollow, because we\u0027ve never discussed what I did while I was in jail. She\u0027s never asked, and I\u0027ve never told her.\n Besides, she doesn\u0027t want to know the truth. If pretending will heal this family, I\u0027m okay with it. I think it\u0027s bullshit, but I\u0027m okay with it.\n Mrs. Gutterman is whisked away by someone else, leaving my mom and me standing together.\n She leans closer to me. \"Button that shirt up more,\" she whispers.\n I look down at my shirt. I only have two buttons unbuttoned. I\u0027m not willing to argue with my mom today. It\u0027s not worth it. There\u0027s so many things I need to fix, fighting about a damn button would be laughable.\n As I\u0027m buttoning up my shirt, I glance at the Goth Girl leaning against the side of the house. I pour a glass of root beer and walk over to my sister. I\u0027ve tried holding a smile for as long as I can, but my face is starting to hurt from the effort. \"Here,\" I say, handing the drink to her, \"your favorite.\"\n She shakes her jet-black hair. \"Not anymore.\"\n So now I\u0027m standing here with the drink nobody wants in my hand. I take a sip. Yuck. \"Tastes like licorice. I don\u0027t know why you ever liked the stuff in the first place.\"\n \"Now I drink water. Plain, old water.\"\n This, coming from the girl who used to spike her lemonade with root beer and refused to eat chicken without smothering it with her own concoction of barbeque sauce, ketchup, mustard, and parmesan cheese. Plain water doesn\u0027t fit Leah, whether my little sister wants to admit it or not.\n I stand beside her and take in the setting. Paradise isn\u0027t a large town, but the word \"party\" brings people out in droves. \"Quite a crowd here tonight.\"\n \"Yep. Mom went all out,\" she says.\n \"Dad didn\u0027t try to stop her.\"\n Leah shrugs, then says, \"Why would he? She\u0027d still do it her way in the end.\" A few minutes pass before I hear Leah\u0027s voice again. \"Did they make you cut your hair like that?\"\n I run my hand over the prickly buzz cut. \"No.\"\n \"It makes you look tough.\"\n Should I tell her what her dyed black hair looks like? I briefly consider it, but quickly realize her blackness goes deeper than her hair. Broaching that subject at a party wouldn\u0027t be the best course of action.\n Leah shuffles her feet. \"Brian is having a party tonight at his house.\"\n \"Two parties in Paradise in one night? Boy, things sure have changed.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-4.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
