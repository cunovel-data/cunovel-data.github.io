{"id":86605,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"And, for the second time since he\u0027s been back, he reaches out to touch me.\n TWENTY-ONE\n Caleb\n I swear, my leg almost just gave out on me. Because the last person I expected to answer the door to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house was Maggie Armstrong wearing a ridiculous, oversized dress with pink and green flowers plastered all over it.\n I try and grab her arm when she loses her balance, but I\u0027m too late. Once on the floor, she refuses my outstretched hand.\n \"Wh ... What are you doing here?\"\n \"What are you doing here?\" I ask.\n \"I work here after school,\" she says while trying to pretend she\u0027s content to stay sprawled on the floor.\n I quickly shove my Justice Department ID in my back pocket. I double-check the address again before saying, \"I\u0027m here to see a Mrs. Reynolds. This is her house, isn\u0027t it?\" Maggie\u0027s hatred is evident in her stare. \"Listen, seeing you here is a surprise to me, too,\" I say. \"The manager at The Trusty Nail sent me. This lady\u0027s house is the next job site on the list.\"\n I watch as Maggie pulls herself up. It\u0027s painful, I can tell just by watching her fingers curl into a tight fist.\n God, watching her struggle is making me sick to my stomach. Because I indirectly did this to her. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say.\n \"Tell it to the judge,\" she mumbles.\n \"I did,\" I respond truthfully. Not that it mattered to Judge Farkus. The guy wanted to make me an example for all delinquents who drank then got behind the wheel of a car. \"What do you want from me, Maggie?\"\n \"I want you to leave.\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" I tell her.\n An old lady appears from the back of the house and shuffles to the door. \"You must be from the community service program,\" she says.\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" I introduce myself and hand her my community service ID for inspection. It\u0027s a requirement to show it before entering a house.\n Mrs. Reynolds scans my ID, then hands it back. \"Well, come on in. This here\u0027s Margaret, my companion. Margaret this is ... what did you say your name was again?\"\n \"Caleb.\"\n Mrs. Reynolds tells Maggie, \"Caleb is going to help us. Show him to the attic and explain our project while I check on some cookies I have baking in the oven.\"\n I set my backpack on the ground after Mrs. Reynolds is out of sight. \"Another awkward situation, huh?\"\n Maggie is as still as a statue.\n \"I wish you never came back,\" she says quietly, hugging herself.\n I\u0027m tempted to leave and face Damon\u0027s wrath for ditching community service, but I won\u0027t. I\u0027m stuck here with her.\n \"I\u0027m not going anywhere until I finish this job for the lady.\"\n Maggie\u0027s eyes widen. Her mouth opens and closes, but no words come out. She turns around and walks farther into the house.\n I silently follow her up a narrow staircase on the second floor to the attic.\n Maggie points to a box. \"That needs to be thrown out. I\u0027ll put boxes there and you can dispose of them.\"\n I nod.\n We work in silence. Maggie places the boxes in the discard pile and I carry them down the stairs. Mrs. Reynolds has me stuff the boxes in huge garbage bags and then lug them to the recycle bin at the end of the driveway.\n Mrs. Reynolds comes out of the kitchen and hands me a plate of cookies. \"Here, bring these up to the attic. You and Maggie can share them while you work.\"\n I enter the attic for what seems like the hundredth time today with the cookies in hand. Maggie throws a box in my direction, but I move out of the way to avoid it. It was intentional, no doubt about it. \"Watch it, will ya?\" I drop the plate on a trunk in the middle of the attic.\n She turns her back to me and ignores the plate.\n Maggie thinks she\u0027s the only victim in this whole mess. But I have to keep my cool. No matter what happens, I can\u0027t let her get under my skin and let the truth come out.\n \"Listen, Maggie, it was an accident. If I could take back that day, I would. If I could turn back time, I would.\"\n She turns to me now, her head tilted to the side. \"Tell me, Caleb. Why does your apology sound so hollow to me?\"\n I stand, speechless, as she takes the plate of cookies and leaves the attic. Why can\u0027t this be easy? I pick up the next box and don\u0027t look up until all the boxes are trashed.\n Maggie leaves Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house first, but I stay behind. The old lady is in the backyard when I hand her the completion sheet and pen. \"Thanks for letting me work here,\" I say.\n \"My husband, Albert, may he rest in peace, felt it important to help out the less fortunate. Don\u0027t get me started on the juvenile justice system or we\u0027ll be here for weeks. You did a good job today.\"\n I flash her a smile of appreciation.\n She starts to sign the form, but stops herself. \"It says here you have experience in construction. You know ... I may have another job for you. That is, if you\u0027re up to it.\"\n \"What kind of job?\"\n \"How good are you with your hands?\"\n \"Better than most,\" I say, then chuckle.\n The old lady points to a tall pile of lumber stacked in the corner of the backyard. \"Okay, Mr. Better-Than-Most. You think you could build me a gazebo out of this pile of old wood? You do know what a gazebo is, don\u0027t you?\"\n Yeah, I know what one is. Building a gazebo will take at least a couple of weeks, probably even fill up enough time to finish my community service.\n What am I thinking? I can\u0027t work with Maggie. No way. It would never work.\n Although it\u0027s not like I\u0027d actually be working with her. I\u0027ll be on my own, building the gazebo. The way Mrs. Reynolds is looking at me with confidence strengthens my bruised ego. I\u0027m not thinking about Maggie. I\u0027m not thinking about what\u0027s right or wrong. I blurt out, \"I can do it.\" I should be honest with the lady and tell her about why I was convicted. And, more importantly, who I was convicted of hitting. \"Mrs. Reynolds, I have to be honest with you ...\"\n As if on cue, the phone rings. The old lady takes her cane and hurries into the house. \"Just come back tomorrow and we\u0027ll finish our conversation then.\"\n So now I run to catch the bus because I\u0027m late. When I get on, Maggie is sitting up front so I head for the rear.\n The fifteen-minute bus ride seems like an hour. At our stop, we\u0027re the only two left on the bus. We get off and I let her lead the way while I follow behind.\n My sister is outside. The expression on her face when she sees Maggie and me walking up the street together is priceless.\n \"Did you just come home with Maggie?\" Leah asks, following me into the house.\n \"We were on the same bus. Don\u0027t get all hyped up about it.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get all hyped up about what?\" my mom says, coming into the room in the middle of a conversation I don\u0027t want her to know anything about.\n \"It\u0027s nothing,\" I tell Mom, then narrow my eyes at my sister and say through clenched teeth so only she can hear, \"so stop making a big deal about it.\"\n Leah runs up to her room and slams her door shut. My mom goes back into the kitchen, totally oblivious.\n The Beckers are a picture-perfect family. A picture-perfect, royally-fucked-up family.\n TWENTY-TWO *** Maggie\n On Monday I head for the bus after school. As I step into the aisle, I catch sight of Caleb already sitting in the back. It was bad enough working side by side in that small attic last week. If I have to work with him again I\u0027ll quit.\n But then I won\u0027t be going to Spain.\n And if I don\u0027t go to Spain, I won\u0027t be leaving Paradise next semester.\n And if I don\u0027t leave Paradise next semester, Caleb and his friends will be laughing all the way to prom while I sit home and prove them right.\n Maybe he\u0027s not going to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house today and I\u0027m going off on unnecessary tangents for no reason.\n Maybe he\u0027s working somewhere else doing odd jobs. But as he follows me into Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 backyard, my fears are realized.\n \"Now come inside, both of you. Irina brought over some pie.\" Mrs. Reynolds walks into the house, not realizing that neither me nor Caleb has followed her.\n \"Took you long enough,\" Mrs. Reynolds says when I enter the kitchen. \"Here, I cut some pie for both of you.\"\n I sit down at the kitchen table and stare at the pie. Normally I\u0027d dig right in, but I can\u0027t. Caleb walks in and sits across from me. I focus my attention in the opposite direction, as if the painting of the fruit bowl on the wall is the most interesting object I\u0027ve ever laid eyes on.\n \"Margaret, remember you told me I should have that gazebo built?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I answer cautiously.\n Mrs. Reynolds holds her chin up. \"Well, Caleb is going to help make that a reality. It may take a few weeks, but--\"\n A few weeks? \"If he stays, I quit,\" I blurt out. A few weeks?\n I hear the clink of Caleb\u0027s fork hitting the plate, then he stands and storms out of the room.\n Mrs. Reynolds puts her hands on either side of her face and says, \"Margaret, what is all this nonsense about you quitting? Why?\"\n \"I can\u0027t work with him, Mrs. Reynolds. He did this to me,\" I cry.\n \"Did what, child?\"\n \"I went to jail for hitting Maggie with my car while I was drunk,\" Caleb says, reappearing in the doorway.\n Mrs. Reynolds makes some tsking noises, then says, \"My, my, we are in a pickle, aren\u0027t we?\"\n I look up at Mrs. Reynolds with pleading eyes. \"Just make him leave.\"\n I can tell she\u0027s going to do it, she\u0027s going to tell Caleb to get out.\n Mrs. Reynolds walks up to Caleb and says, \"You have to understand that my first priority is Margaret. I\u0027ll call the senior center and have them contact your community service officer.\"\n \"Please, Mrs. Reynolds,\" Caleb tells her, his voice pleading. \"I just want to finish the job and just... be free again.\"\n Mrs. Reynolds looks back at me, her wise eyes telling me more than words could say. Forgive.\n I can\u0027t forgive. I\u0027ve tried. If he\u0027d innocently lost control of the car and hit me, it would have been forgivable. I don\u0027t know how innocent the accident was. God, I can\u0027t believe in my heart of hearts he deliberately hit me with the car. But too many questions have gone unanswered.\n Questions I want to remain unanswered.\n They said he left me lying in the street as if I were an animal. That is unforgivable. I don\u0027t know if I can ever get over it.\n Because it reminds me too much of what my father did. He left me without looking back. And worse, Caleb destroyed the one chance I had to impress my dad. I push my way past Caleb and head to the attic, a place that\u0027s dark, secluded, and private. I\u0027m not even thinking about black widow spiders as I open the attic door and hobble inside.\n Gosh, I used to worship the ground Caleb walked on. He was tall, handsome ... clearly one of the populars, where Leah\u0027s and my status teetered on the edge. As if that wasn\u0027t enough, nothing ever bothered the guy. Maybe it\u0027s because guys like him always get what they want, they never have to work hard for anything. Maybe, deep down, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s having a hard time. And deep down I know it\u0027s selfish for me to think this way. I shouldn\u0027t thrive on someone else\u0027s unhappiness.\n But as the saying goes, misery likes company. And I feel miserable, inside and out. Isn\u0027t it fair that the person who\u0027s miserable with me is the guy who made me this way?\n Mrs. Reynolds followed me, I can tell by the powdery scent that travels with her.\n \"This is a mighty interesting place to hide out. I thought you were afraid of spiders.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-15.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
