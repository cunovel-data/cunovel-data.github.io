{"id":86603,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"I didn\u0027t have the heart to tell her a pretty dress can\u0027t erase the ugly scars hiding underneath.\n We head over to the Paradise County Fairgrounds. They\u0027ve transformed the fairgrounds into an amusement park, complete with a Ferris wheel and dunking booth.\n The Ladies\u0027 Auxiliary sponsors the festival each year. Usually the entire town attends.\n The food pavilion is covered in twinkling lights, reminding me of Christmas.\n Mom puts down the brownies she made on the pot-luck table, then scans the crowd. \"Look, there\u0027s Lou,\" she says, pointing.\n Sitting next to him is his mother, my boss. \"Should we go say hi?\" I ask.\n Mom shrugs. \"It would be nice.\"\n When we reach the table, Mr. Reynolds stands up and smiles. \"Linda, glad you made it. Hi, Maggie.\"\n \"Hi, Mr. Reynolds. Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.\"\n Mr. Reynolds leans close and whispers in my ear, \"We\u0027re not at the diner. You can call me Lou.\"\n \"That\u0027d be weird,\" I say. Calling Mom\u0027s boss by his first name is just too ... I don\u0027t know ... familiar.\n \"Okay, well, when you don\u0027t feel weird about it give it a try.\n Mom sits next to her boss and I walk around the table and plop down next to Mrs. Reynolds.\n \"Mrs. Reynolds, it was so generous of you to give my daughter a job,\" Mom says. \"As I told you on the phone, I\u0027m very grateful.\"\n \"I\u0027m the grateful one,\" Mrs. Reynolds says. \"We\u0027ve had a productive first week. Haven\u0027t we, Margaret?\"\n My fingernails still have dirt under them that I haven\u0027t been able to scrape out. \"Mrs. Reynolds is an expert on daffodils, Mom.\"\n \"When you get back from Spain they\u0027ll be up and blooming,\" Mrs. Reynolds says.\n I smile, thinking about leaving for Spain. It\u0027s about the only thing making me smile lately.\n Mrs. Reynolds looks longingly at the buffet table. \"I\u0027m famished,\" she says. \"How about we take a gander at the food and see if there\u0027s anything worthwhile.\"\n \"Mom, don\u0027t stuff yourself,\" Mr. Reynolds says over the loud dance music the band just started to play on the makeshift stage in front of the Fun House.\n Mrs. Reynolds rolls her eyes. \"My son thinks I\u0027m a child.\"\n \"Mom, you know what the--\" Mr. Reynolds\u0027 gruff voice chimes in.\n Mrs. Reynolds silences her son with a single stare. Mom looks kind of nervous and I feel the same way. I don\u0027t want to get involved in this. It\u0027s clearly out of my jurisdiction as companion.\n Mr. Reynolds turns to my mom. \"Linda, how about showing the teens some old dance moves?\"\n Wow, that came out of left field. Mom never dances. She and my dad would come to the festival year after year and I never once saw them sway to the music, let alone dance.\n \"I\u0027d love to,\" Mom says. \"Maggie, you don\u0027t mind, do you?\n When I shake my head, she takes Mr. Reynolds\u0027 outstretched hand and he leads her away from the food pavilion.\n I\u0027m sitting here with my eyes wide open. What just happened? Did my mom accept a dance with her boss? Isn\u0027t that illegal?\n I can see the dance floor from where I\u0027m sitting. Right away, Mom is wiggling her body and moving around like a teenager. I scan the fairgrounds to see if anyone else is paying attention. Sure enough, a group of kids from school are watching her.\n I want to die.\n Why would Mom want to dance in the first place? She\u0027s making a spectacle of herself, jumping around as if she doesn\u0027t care people are staring. Isn\u0027t it bad enough people stare at me?\n \"Margaret, I\u0027m ready to load up my plate now that my son who thinks he\u0027s a doctor is out of my hair. Will you help me?\"\n I tear my gaze away from the dancing queen. \"Uh, yeah, sure.\"\n Mrs. Reynolds leans on her cane as we head to the food line. I hold her plate and pile food on as she points to various dishes. The old lady is totally oblivious to the scene on the dance floor.\n \"What do you keep staring at?\" Mrs. Reynolds asks.\n \"Nothing.\"\n \"That nothing\u0027s getting a lot of attention.\"\n I make a harrumph and move down the line. But when I get to Mrs. Becker\u0027s famous Spaghetti Spectacular, I freeze and wonder if Leah and Caleb are here.\n \"This one looks good,\" Mrs. Reynolds says, referring to the spaghetti dish.\n \"It tastes good, too,\" I admit. \"But can you eat it? Mr. Reynolds said--\"\n \"Margaret, I\u0027m an old lady who enjoys her food. If I can\u0027t eat what I want, you might as well bury me six feet under right here and now.\"\n \"Okaay,\" I say warily. \"If you insist.\" I place a small spoonful on Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 plate, but she raises her eyebrows and urges me to heap on another spoonful. When we get to the end of the buffet line, I\u0027m afraid to take another glance at the dance floor.\n It\u0027s like a car wreck. You know what you\u0027re going to see is bad, but you can\u0027t help it. I wonder if that\u0027s how people felt when they saw me lying on the ground after the accident.\n Okay, so I\u0027m just like everyone else. I check out the dance floor and, thankfully, my mom is nowhere to be found. But I do see Kendra Greene. She\u0027s slow dancing with Brian Newcomb as if he were the love of her life.\n My dream is to find a guy who\u0027ll love me despite my flaws and won\u0027t turn away from me when a perfect girl walks by. Maybe a boy like that doesn\u0027t even exist.\n I\u0027m sitting at the table watching Mrs. Reynolds eat. I have no clue how she packs it all in for such a small woman. She takes a small bite of the Spaghetti Spectacular and gives me a nod. \"It\u0027s like a burst of flavor and different textures making it taste ...\"\n \"Spectacular?\" I say.\n \"Quite,\" she agrees, and we both laugh. Mom comes sidling over to the table. Was that a shimmy I just saw her do as she sat down? \"What\u0027s so funny?\" Mom asks.\n \"The spaghetti dish,\" Mrs. Reynolds says. \"It is spectacular.\"\n There\u0027s silence now, because Mom immediately knows we\u0027re talking about Mrs. Becker\u0027s award-winning specialty.\n Mr. Reynolds is sweating and takes a sip of water. \"Is something wrong?\"\n Mom shakes her head.\n The band guy is yelling for the over-twenty-one crowd to get on the dance floor. Parents flock to the middle of the floor, ready to show off their moves.\n I watch the other kids in my grade running around and enjoying themselves. Brian and Kendra enter the Fun House. Drew Rudolph is trying to coax Brianne onto the Tilt-A-Whirl. My cousin Sabrina is sitting next to her sister on the Ferris wheel.\n \"Go on,\" Mrs. Reynolds says. \"Join your friends.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have friends,\" I admit. \"I\u0027m what you call a loser. Or a loner. Take your pick.\"\n \"Pshaw.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Pshaw. Hogwash. You\u0027re a smart, pretty young lady. Girls like you are not losers. Or loners.\"\n \"I\u0027m not pretty, that\u0027s for sure. And I limp.\"\n She looks me up and down. \"You may lack fashion sense, but you have fine features when you\u0027re not pouting or looking startled. And the limp ... as long as it doesn\u0027t bother you, it shouldn\u0027t matter what people think.\"\n I believe I have that startled look on my face right now.\n \"And what\u0027s this nonsense about you not having any friends? Everyone should have at least one friend.\"\n I glance around and spot Leah Becker, sitting alone at one of the tables. Her parents are in a deep conversation with another couple a few feet away. I would walk up to her, but she\u0027d probably ignore me.\n Mrs. Reynolds puts her hand on mine. \"Is she a friend?\"\n \"Used to be.\"\n \"Go talk to her.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t even know what to say.\"\n Mrs. Reynolds lets out a frustrated breath. \"Suit yourself, child. But when you\u0027re an old bird like me you\u0027ll be wishing you had more friends in your life. Being alone isn\u0027t fun, is it?\"\n \"No. Being alone isn\u0027t fun.\"\n I look over at my mom, who is now line dancing. She doesn\u0027t look alone. In fact, she hasn\u0027t looked this happy for a long time. Mom smiles at Mr. Reynolds and he smiles back.\n Mr. Reynolds. Lou. My mom\u0027s boss. My boss\u0027 son. Well, whatever his name is, it\u0027s clear to me he has the hots for my mom.\n I don\u0027t know if I should be embarrassed, angry, or happy for her.\n NINETEEN\n Caleb\n My pants are too fucking tight and this shirt has so much starch in it I feel like a mannequin. But I\u0027m here, at the Fall Festival. Once I\u0027m done acting like the model son, I\u0027m outta here.\n I spot my parents by the food pavilion, talking with another couple. Nothing has changed since I\u0027ve been back. My sister is still a zombie, but it\u0027s worse now, because since she ran out of the lunchroom Monday, she\u0027s ignored me. My parents haven\u0027t brought up the accident since I\u0027ve been back. I tried to talk about it, but I\u0027ve been shut down.\n When I walk up to my parents, my mom smiles. \"We were waiting for you, Caleb.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m here,\" I say unenthusiastically, not in the least ready to put on this show.\n My dad looks tired; there are circles under his eyes and he\u0027s not walking as tall and straight as I remember. \"Caleb, do you remember Dr. and Mrs. Tremont? Dr. Tremont owns a dental practice in Denton, and just opened one up in Paradise now that Dr. Kryzanowich retired.\"\n \"Really?\"\n Dr. Tremont points to the east. \"Over by Central and Carriagedale Roads. You know, the new building next to the Paradise cinemas.\"\n I shake my head. \"I haven\u0027t seen it yet.\"\n \"Where have you been hiding out?\" Dr. Tremont says, laughing. \"It\u0027s the building with the big tooth out front.\"\n My dad is turning red under his collar. \"I\u0027m starving,\" he says before I tell Dr. Tremont that I haven\u0027t seen his big toothed building because I\u0027ve been locked up in jail for the past year. \"Why don\u0027t you taste some of my wife\u0027s dish while Caleb finds his friends.\"\n Mom does a really good job of directing the Tremonts to the buffet table and away from me. Do you think Mom realizes it wasn\u0027t the best idea to try and pretend like I\u0027m a perfect son? My sister joins them, totally ignoring me.\n The Fall Festival is a zoo. It\u0027s hard to believe Paradise is a small town when there are so many people around. Brian and the guys are hanging out near the parking lot.\n \"Wow, Caleb, who dressed you?\" Brian quips, shaking his head in disbelief.\n I grimace. \"Would you believe it if I told you my mother did?\"\n Brian nods. \"Yeah. Paradise wasn\u0027t the same without you, man. But those clothes have got to go.\"\n Drew chuckles while he lights a cigarette. \"You\u0027re right, Brian. Paradise isn\u0027t the same. I saw Mrs. Armstrong dancing with that guy from the diner. They looked pretty tight. Do you think they\u0027re ... you, know? God knows Maggie\u0027s not gettin\u0027 any. That girl needs a bunch more surgeries before she\u0027ll attract any dude. Maybe she could get a prom date over the internet.\"\n Nobody laughs, because Drew is not funny. He\u0027s been a jerk ever since I came back, trying his best to piss me off on purpose.\n Tristan throws a football in the air. \"We\u0027re heading over to the field to play ball. Let\u0027s go before our moms try to make us dance with them.\"\n I take off the ridiculous shirt while I play, but my balls are being strangled by the pants I\u0027m wearing. After forty-five minutes, we head back. But when Tristan and Brian are ahead of us, I grab Drew by the shoulder and push him back into a tree. I take him completely off guard. He has no clue I\u0027m tempted to kick his ass. One thing I learned at the DOC from the inmates ... take them when they least expect it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-13.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
