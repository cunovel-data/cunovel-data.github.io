{"id":86617,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"Tell me about it,\" he says.\\n\\n But when Coach Wenner gets up to the podium, the guys on the Paradise wrestling team are never ones to take a back seat. A roar goes up behind me. \"Wee-ner! Wee-ner! Wee-ner!\"\\n\\n The guys are pronouncing the coach\u0027s name wrong on purpose. I bet Wenner is already planning how many extra push-ups he\u0027ll make the team do in practice to make up for it.\\n\\n The rest of the school gets into it, even as the teachers are trying to put a kabash on the latest chant.\\n\\n \"Wee-ner! Wee-ner.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, ha ha, very funny. You had your laugh, now let\u0027s get to it,\" Coach says. \"Andy Abrams, Caleb Becker, Adrian Cho, David Grant...\"\\n\\n Even though our school is small, it takes a while to get through all the names.\\n\\n Finally, after more than an hour stuck in this hot gym, Meyer gets back on the mic and dismisses us to our sixth period classes. Trying to get out is like a mob scene. Everyone is as restless as I am to escape. But I\u0027m hanging back.\\n\\n I scan the bleachers. My sister is looking down, oblivious to anything except the stairs. Maggie is standing with the rest of the mob pushing through to get out. She looks so fragile standing there, like a bird surrounded by an elephant stampede.\\n\\n There\u0027s some pushing and shoving. Two junior guys are fighting. And it\u0027s right where Maggie is. \"Maggie, watch out!\" I yell, but she can\u0027t hear me. She doesn\u0027t notice the commotion behind her, but I\u0027m too late and it\u0027s too noisy. The guy is pushed into Maggie, who trips over two steps and lands flat on her knee.\\n\\n \"Maggie!\" I yell, pushing people out of the way to get to her. I finally reach her and kneel next to her. \"Maggie, you okay?\"\\n\\n She blinks, looks like she\u0027s going to be sick, and sits up.\\n\\n \"Mag-ie, Mag-ie, Mag-ie,\" the crowd starts chanting.\\n\\n I look up at the crowd and yell, \"Shut the fuck up!\" but nobody is listening. I grab Maggie\u0027s elbow. She tries to pull away but I hang on tight. \"Are you okay?\" I ask once she\u0027s standing. Most of the kids have stopped chanting her name, but a few assholes still have nothing better to do.\\n\\n Drew grabs my shoulder and pulls me back. \"Caleb, what are you helping her for? The bitch was responsible for putting you in jail.\"\\n\\n I take my fist and slam it right into Drew\u0027s face. He charges me and we\u0027re at each other\u0027s throats, fists flying, until Wenner and another coach break us up.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Maggie?\" I ask.\\n\\n Wenner looks at me like I\u0027ve lost it. \"At the nurse.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to see her.\"\\n\\n \"The only thing you\u0027re seeing is the principal\u0027s office, Becker. What\u0027s wrong with you?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m escorted to Meyer\u0027s office. I have no choice since Wenner has my wrists pinned behind my back. \"Wait here for Mr. Meyer,\" the coach orders.\\n\\n But as soon as he leaves the office, I hop over the front desk and open the nurse\u0027s door. Maggie\u0027s pants are rolled up just above her knees.\\n\\n My gaze immediately focuses on her scars.\\n\\n The angry lines from where the doctors must have sewed her up are pink and look like her leg has been clawed by a fierce animal.\\n\\n By her knee, where the biggest sets of marks are, I think is a skin graft, because it\u0027s a darker shade and doesn\u0027t match the rest of her soft, ivory skin.\\n\\n Tearing my gaze away from her leg, I look up at her. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Maggie,\" I say.\\n\\n Her expression is hard, her eyes shuttered. \"Go away, Caleb. Or do you want to take a picture so you could show Kendra? Then you\u0027d both have something else to laugh about.\"\\n\\n FORTY\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n Caleb doesn\u0027t even know Mrs. Reynolds died. When I saw him in the hall this morning, I was going to tell him. But then I caught Caleb and Kendra together. Before our relationship started, I could understand. But I thought he liked me enough not to need someone else. I thought what we had was real. Ugh. I don\u0027t want to think about Kendra Greene and her perfect blonde hair and her perfect, perky boobs or the perfect way she walks. But I can\u0027t help it. Because I\u0027m not perfect.\\n\\n I\u0027m sitting in the nurse\u0027s office to prove it. Ever since Caleb stood there frozen, gawking at the scars on my leg, I\u0027ve been dying to get out of here. \"Can I go back to class now?\"\\n\\n The school nurse is bent over my leg with rubber gloves, examining it. She looks up. \"Does it hurt?\"\\n\\n You mean my heart? \"No. It\u0027s fine,\" I say. \"Really.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a little blood here. I\u0027m concerned there might be internal damage.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a little scratch,\" I say as the woman is putting antiseptic on a cotton ball and rubbing blood off my knee. \"A big deal was made for nothing.\"\\n\\n I know why Caleb came running over to me and acted all concerned. It\u0027s because he feels guilty that I overheard details about his relationship with Kendra. Drew was only telling the truth, that I was responsible for putting him in jail. Caleb and I should never have started talking. We should have kept ignoring each other at Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house.\\n\\n Because if we didn\u0027t talk, I wouldn\u0027t be so connected to him.\\n\\n If we didn\u0027t talk, I wouldn\u0027t have kissed him and wanted more. I wouldn\u0027t have let him manipulate me.\\n\\n Nurse Sandusky doesn\u0027t look happy as I get down off of the examining table and carefully lower my pant leg. But I\u0027m not going to sit here and sulk all day. I\u0027m going to get up and stand tall--to Caleb, to Drew, to Kendra ... and whoever else decides to get in my way.\\n\\n When I\u0027m dressed, I breathe a sigh of relief. My scars are covered. So why do I feel so exposed? Because Caleb has seen the scars from the injuries he put on my body.\\n\\n The forever scars that will make me think of him and the accident every day of my life.\\n\\n Unfortunately I have to pass Meyers office on my way out. Caleb is sitting in front of the secretary\u0027s desk, his head slumped in his hands.\\n\\n As if he knows I\u0027m watching him, he lifts his head up. His eyes bore into me as if they\u0027re seeking warmth or connection. Does he think I\u0027m a fool who wants to be humiliated? I look away, wait for the nurse to write me a pass, and leave the office as fast as I can.\\n\\n As if the day couldn\u0027t get worse, Kendra and Hannah are walking down the hall. They haven\u0027t seen me yet. I duck into the girls\u0027 bathroom ... I\u0027ve had enough for one day.\\n\\n I look at myself in the bathroom mirror. Dull hazel eyes, hair that hasn\u0027t decided if it wants to be dark or light, and a nose that\u0027s too big for my face. On top of all those flaws, I have a limp.\\n\\n How could I ever have thought I could compete with perfect Kendra Greene?\\n\\n The bathroom door creaks open. I hide in one of the stalls and soon enough I hear Kendra say, \"I can\u0027t imagine the two of them kissing. Can you?\"\\n\\n \"Puh-leaze, Kend, don\u0027t gross me out. Caleb is, like, Hollywood tough guy and Maggie is, like, a total dork. She probably kisses with her lips all pursed and her hands at her sides.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. You should have seen her this morning. I thought she was going to cry right in the middle of the hall.\"\\n\\n The two of them laugh.\\n\\n I want to die. Forget standing tall, deep down I really am a dork and a coward.\\n\\n I peek through the door opening. Hannah is putting on her lipstick while Kendra is playing with her big, blonde hair.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s always going to love you. You two have a bond that can\u0027t be broken,\" Hannah says.\\n\\n Kendra stops playing with her hair and leans against one of the sinks. \"Caleb told Brian he was interested in Maggie to throw him off.\"\\n\\n \"Why Maggie? Isn\u0027t she the least likely person to snag him? He did hit her with his car, you know. And she milks it for all it\u0027s worth.\"\\n\\n Kendra hesitates.\\n\\n \"What?\" Hannah asks.\\n\\n \"Did you check under the stalls?\"\\n\\n Oops. I\u0027m dead meat. Balancing on top of the toilet seat with a bum leg is not an option.\\n\\n The door to one of the stalls creaks open. Oh, no. I\u0027m trying to peek through the door, but I don\u0027t want to stumble or make any sounds to alert them I\u0027m spying.\\n\\n \"You two are so pathetic. You should have looked before you started babbling about your pathetic lives.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s Sabrina, my cousin.\\n\\n \"What did you hear?\" Kendra says.\\n\\n \"What do you think? I heard all of it.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll keep it to yourself, won\u0027t you Sabrina?\"\\n\\n Sabrina puts her hands on her hips. \"I don\u0027t know. Why don\u0027t you stop spreading rumors about my cousin? She may limp, but she\u0027s got more to admire than both of you put together.\"\\n\\n The other girls stare at Sabrina as if she sprouted wings, totally shocked that the follower finally proved she has a mind of her own.\\n\\n \"Get a grip, Sabrina. Don\u0027t forget, you were a loser and Maggie was in your spot a year ago. Just because you\u0027re friends with Brianne and Danielle now doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re suddenly hot shit.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s right. I wasn\u0027t nice to Sabrina when I was on top and she was struggling to keep friends that didn\u0027t hide in the library during lunch. I think Kendra\u0027s words are going to bring Sabrina down a notch, but my cousin doesn\u0027t miss a beat.\\n\\n \"Kendra, I used to worship the ground you walked on because you were pretty and popular and had a boyfriend the rest of the girls only dreamed they could get. I wanted to be popular, to be like you. Now I just think you\u0027re pathetic.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better watch yourself, Sabrina, or you might just find yourself a loser again so quick your head will spin.\" Kendra\u0027s eyes are wide and wild, and I think if she had superpowers they\u0027d melt Sabrina with that one stare. But she doesn\u0027t have superpowers. Hannah is standing behind Kendra with her thumb and forefinger in an \"L\" on her forehead, directing it toward Sabrina.\\n\\n While Sabrina is sticking up for me and being threatened, I\u0027m hiding out like a coward. My palms are sweaty. I realize it\u0027s my own fear holding me back. I watch my cousin sticking up for me knowing the end result is not going to be pretty. I feel Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 spirit giving me courage.\\n\\n I push the stall door open wide, the loud creak alerting all three to my presence.\\n\\n Sabrina\u0027s face is as shocked as Kendra\u0027s and Hannah\u0027s.\\n\\n Kendra gives a nervous laugh, but recovers quickly. \"Is this, like, the designated loser bathroom and I never got the memo?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just like your cousin,\" Hannah says to me. \"One who\u0027ll always follow in the footsteps of girls like me and Kendra.\"\\n\\n I hobble next to my cousin. \"Hannah, you and Kendra have it all. And yet... you\u0027re both empty shells, nothing worthwhile on the inside. I wouldn\u0027t follow you even if it meant healing my legs.\"\\n\\n \"I think the accident damaged your brain.\" Kendra spits out the words like a dragon would spit fire at its enemy.\\n\\n Sabrina is watching me in shock. I know I haven\u0027t been strong since the accident. I never stick up for myself and I focus on my flaws instead of my assets. Spending time with a strong woman like Mrs. Reynolds must have rubbed off on me. And spending time with Caleb the past few months has made me feel attractive and beautiful. I just ... deep down I can\u0027t believe he was lying to me. Admiration shined through the depths of his eyes. His fingers trembled when he traced my lips or touched my face. A guy like Caleb, who hides his emotions, couldn\u0027t fake those intense reactions even if he wanted to.\\n\\n Kendra shakes her head and sneers at me. \"If Caleb gave you any attention, he just felt sorry for you.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m sure he did ... but what we shared went way beyond that. \"I wouldn\u0027t sneer if I were you,\" I say to Kendra. \"It doesn\u0027t suit your face.\"\\n\\n My cousin turns to me. \"Caleb? No, it can\u0027t be true. Can it?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-27.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \\n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
