{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong. Even after months of painful physical therapy, Maggie walks with a limp. Her social life is nil and a scholarship to study abroad—her chance to escape everyone and their pitying stares—has been canceled. \n After a year in juvenile jail, Caleb’s free . . . if freedom means endless nagging from a transition coach and the prying eyes of the entire town. Coming home should feel good, but his family and ex-girlfriend seem like strangers. \n Caleb and Maggie are outsiders, pigeon-holed as \"criminal\" and \"freak.\" Then the truth emerges about what really happened the night of the accident and, once again, everything changes. It’s a bleak and tortuous journey for Caleb and Maggie, yet they end up finding comfort and strength from a surprising source: each other.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":31,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
