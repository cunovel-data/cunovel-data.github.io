{"id":86619,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"Give them back,\" she says, pulling the bottle from my hand and clutching them as if they hold her sanity.\\n\\n \"You can overdose on that shit, Mom. It\u0027s dangerous.\"\\n\\n My mom laughs, a throaty laugh so strong it makes her cough.\\n\\n \"Is that why you\u0027ve been avoiding getting close to me. You\u0027ve become a closet pill popper?\" Damn, why didn\u0027t I see this before?\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not in the closet anymore, is it?\"\\n\\n \"Does Dad know?\"\\n\\n \"What do you think? It\u0027s the only way I can keep a smile on my face all day. He doesn\u0027t like to think about the bad stuff. He\u0027s too busy. I\u0027ve been a failure, haven\u0027t I? A terrible wife, a terrible mother ... it\u0027s no wonder I was kicked out of the Ladies\u0027 Auxiliary.\"\\n\\n \"Stop caring what everyone thinks!\" I yell. \"You\u0027re killing the entire family.\"\\n\\n \"Did you think about the entire family when you hit Maggie?\" she whispers, then huffs out a disgusted breath.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t about me, Mom.\" I don\u0027t tell her it never was about me.\\n\\n She shakes her head. \"You don\u0027t get it, Caleb, do you? There\u0027s four people living in this house and we\u0027re all strangers. It is about you. It\u0027s about all of us.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t even know who I am anymore. I thought I did, but with Maggie\u0027s betrayal I\u0027m back where I started.\\n\\n My mom turns to face the sink, her body shaking and wrought with despair. As I walk over and put my arms around her, I want to tell her I\u0027ll help her. I need help, too. But she stiffens as soon as I make contact. \"Don\u0027t touch me.\"\\n\\n I take my hands off her and back away. Everything around me is crashing into a million pieces. There\u0027s no way I can mend them no matter how hard I try. \"Don\u0027t wait up,\" I grind out before leaving the kitchen and taking the stairs two steps at a time. I bang on Leah\u0027s bedroom door. \"Open up.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want?\" Leah says through the door.\\n\\n I pound harder. \"Leah, open this door or I\u0027ll break it down.\"\\n\\n She opens it right before I\u0027m about to kick it open. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"How long has Mom been abusing prescription drugs?\"\\n\\n She shrugs. \"After you got sentenced. She stopped for a while, but started up again when you got released.\"\\n\\n \"How can you just stand there like it\u0027s no big deal?\"\\n\\n Leah stares at me and cocks her head to the side, her black makeup in stark contrast to her white skin, making her look like a mime. \"When she\u0027s numb she doesn\u0027t ask questions.\"\\n\\n Huh? I stare at my sister as if she\u0027s a ghost, a shell of a person I once knew. \"Do you even have a conscience anymore?\"\\n\\n Leah shrugs.\\n\\n I grab her shoulders and yell, \"Leah, grow up and finally take responsibility for something ... anything!\"\\n\\n Tears start streaming down her cheeks. I shouldn\u0027t be satisfied that I\u0027m making my sister cry, but I swear any emotion from her pleases me. I feel her emotions, too. But they\u0027re so conflicted with mine I can\u0027t be close to her. Not now. A part of Leah has always been a part of me. Her misery has become mine, and right now I want nothing to do with it.\\n\\n She\u0027s sobbing while I leave the house and head down the street.\\n\\n I walk ten houses away before I realize where I\u0027m headed: Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. The lady is the only one who\u0027s tough enough to help. Maybe she\u0027ll let me live with her, in that little room above the garage.\\n\\n Waiting twenty minutes for a bus to come to take me to Hampton seems like forever. When it comes and I take one look at the old lady\u0027s house, I feel like I\u0027m home.\\n\\n I ring the doorbell, hoping she can hear it. Maybe I\u0027ll install one of those bulbs that light up every time the doorbell rings, so if her hearing really goes she\u0027ll be all set.\\n\\n The second time I ring, the door opens. But it\u0027s not Mrs. Reynolds, it\u0027s the guy who owns Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner. \"Is Mrs. Reynolds home?\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you Caleb Becker?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. I--\"\\n\\n \"How do you know my mother?\" he demands. I put my hands in my pockets. \"I worked for her.\"\\n\\n He hesitates, confused, then his mouth goes wide. \"You built the gazebo?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"While Maggie Armstrong worked here? The both of you, together?\"\\n\\n \"With Mrs. Reynolds,\" I assure him.\\n\\n \"Did she know you were the one that hit Maggie? Forget it, from the look on your face I assume my mother knew. She probably tried to patch everything up, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. I need to talk to Mrs. Reynolds.\" She\u0027s the only one I have left now.\\n\\n \"She passed away yesterday morning.\"\\n\\n No. No, this can\u0027t happen. A hole forms in my chest and spreads through my veins. \"You\u0027re lying.\"\\n\\n \"My mother had a heart attack in her sleep. Now I don\u0027t know what\u0027s been going on here, but I know Maggie\u0027s mother doesn\u0027t want you hanging around her daughter. Respect the family and leave her be.\"\\n\\n \"No problem. No problem at all,\" I say.\\n\\n FORTY-TWO\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n Mom told me Mr. Reynolds had a surprise for me. I went to Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner after school and Mr. Reynolds gave me the keys to his mom\u0027s Cadillac. I protested, but Mom assured me Mrs. Reynolds would want me to have it.\\n\\n So now Mom is driving me to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house on her break. She helps me open the garage. I smile when I see the car, remembering the time Mrs. Reynolds helped me get over my fear of driving.\\n\\n \"You sure you\u0027re ready to do this?\" Mom asks.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure. Now get back to work. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n \"Maggie, you\u0027ve been so strong lately, but I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re ready for this.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s time I tell her how I\u0027m feeling. I\u0027ve been trying to hold it in so I don\u0027t hurt her, when all along I think I\u0027ll hurt her more if I don\u0027t say anything. \"Mom, I need some space,\" I say, then gauge her reaction. She\u0027s looking at me skeptically, but I can tell by the way her lips are together in concentration that she\u0027s listening and attempting to understand.\\n\\n I take a deep breath and say, \"I know it\u0027s hard for you. It\u0027s been unbelievably difficult for me ... but I\u0027m finally ready to accept my body and my limitations. I\u0027m me ... the new me. It might not be a perfect me, but I\u0027m okay with that. It\u0027s about time I stopped trying to escape my life, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n A tear runs down my mom\u0027s cheek. She smiles at me, this warm smile that reaches her eyes. \"The accident... it took a part of you away.\"\\n\\n \"Only because I let it.\"\\n\\n Now we\u0027re both crying. I give her a long hug.\\n\\n After a few minutes she gets in her car and drives away from the house, giving me the space I need. Taking a deep breath, I scan the yard. And swallow hard. The gazebo is standing like a castle in the middle of the grass, outlined by the flower beds. The bulbs are patiently waiting in hibernation until it\u0027s their time to poke their heads out of the ground for the first time and vibrantly come to life.\\n\\n After yesterday, I feel like I\u0027ve bloomed. It took a romance and an old lady to coax me out of hibernation, but it happened.\\n\\n As I\u0027m carefully driving home, I see Caleb at Paradise Park at the basketball courts. I stop to let him know I\u0027m not upset he betrayed me. I\u0027ll get over him. It might take a while, but I\u0027m going to be just fine. I\u0027ll have other boyfriends and adventures in life, other times I\u0027ll be able to feel confident and carefree and happy. I\u0027m a survivor. Even with my limp. Getting out of the car and gathering all my courage, I walk over to him.\\n\\n He sees me, but doesn\u0027t stop dribbling the ball.\\n\\n \"Caleb,\" I call out.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about Mrs. Reynolds?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have a chance. I wanted to,\" I say, then step toward him.\\n\\n \"You better stay back or I might start harassing you.\"\\n\\n Okay, I deserve that. I did slap him and refuse his help yesterday. But that was before I straightened everything out in my head. \"I heard you got in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"You come here to rub it in or you want to challenge me to a one-on-one?\" he says.\\n\\n \"You know I can\u0027t play.\"\\n\\n He looks me up and down suggestively. \"Oh, you play, Maggie. Maybe not basketball, your games are more complicated than that.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n He takes the basketball and holds it at his side, then gives a short laugh. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re afraid of me.\"\\n\\n I move forward, stepping closer to him and putting my chin in the air with confidence. \"I\u0027m not afraid of you.\"\\n\\n He stands before me with as much confidence as I\u0027m showing him. \"Prove it.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n He tosses the basketball to the side of the court and steps toward me, closing the distance between us. \"Figure it out.\"\\n\\n My breath catches and I panic. \"I ... I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"I think you do,\" he says, coming so close I can almost feel his emotions as my own.\\n\\n \"You want me to kiss you?\" I ask breathlessly.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve ruined me, you do know that don\u0027t you?\" he says right before I stand on my tiptoes and touch my lips to his.\\n\\n He grabs my waist and pulls me close so I can feel the full strength and length of his body against mine. My fingers wrap around his biceps at the same time. I\u0027m lost in the protection of his embrace and the smell and taste that\u0027s uniquely Caleb Becker. Uniquely ... us.\\n\\n As our kiss turns more intense, I sense a change in him. He\u0027s kissing harder, fuller. Angry.\\n\\n I stumble backwards and push him away from me. \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Making sure I scare you. It\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it? So you can claim being the victim.\"\\n\\n We\u0027re standing here staring at each other. Controller and controlled. Perpetrator and victim. Boy and girl.\\n\\n He picks up his basketball. \"Go home, Maggie. You got what you came for.\"\\n\\n Movement out of the corner of my eye catches my attention, breaking the connection. It\u0027s Leah.\\n\\n \"Caleb, Mom and Dad want you home. Now,\" she says.\\n\\n I smooth down my hair, pat dirt off my pants, clear my throat, and do everything but look at the two of them.\\n\\n Then I run back to the car as fast as I can.\\n\\n FORTY-THREE\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell her that I hit her, did you?\" Leah asks J. as she watches Maggie run away from the park. I shake my head.\\n\\n \"But you and Maggie. I saw how you looked at her and I knew...\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I say quickly, then look my sister straight in the eye.\\n\\n I start walking back home and my sister steps in beside me. \"Getting mixed up with Maggie can ruin our family, Caleb.\"\\n\\n \"Lay off, Leah. I mean it.\" I turn to her. \"I\u0027ve just about had it.\"\\n\\n When I get home, my parents are waiting for me by the front door. My dad is standing rigid, a stern look on his face. My mom is beside him. I can tell she\u0027s totally out of it.\\n\\n \"Where were you last night?\" Dad orders in such a stern voice you\u0027d think I was out committing murder. \"Visiting an old friend. What\u0027s the big deal?\" My mom looks at my dad. I hold my arms wide. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I saw Maggie coming from the direction of the park,\" Dad says.\\n\\n \"So? It\u0027s a free country, Dad. People can walk where they want to.\"\\n\\n My mom clutches her arms tight, grabbing on to her sweater. \"We just don\u0027t want to see you get into trouble. People talk...\"\\n\\n \"About what?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to discuss it,\" Mom says, then starts to walk woodenly back into the house, no doubt to numb herself again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-29.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \\n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
