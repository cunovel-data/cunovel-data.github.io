{"id":86591,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"ONE\\n\\n Caleb\\n\\n I\u0027ve been waiting a year for this moment. It\u0027s not every day you get a chance to get out of jail. Sure, in the game of Monopoly you just have to roll the dice three times and wait for a double, or pay the fine and be free. But there are no games here at the Illinois Department of Corrections-Juvenile complex; or the DOC as we inmates call it.\\n\\n Oh, it\u0027s not as rough as it sounds. The all male juvenile division is tough, but it\u0027s not like the adult DOC. You might ask why I\u0027ve been locked up for the past year. I was convicted of hitting a girl with my car while driving drunk. It was a hit-and-run accident, too, which actually made the judge in my case royally pissed off. He tacked on an extra three months for that.\\n\\n \"You ready, Caleb?\" Jerry, the cell guard, asks.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" I\u0027ve been waiting three hundred and ten days for this. Hell, yeah, I\u0027m ready.\\n\\n I take a deep breath and follow Jerry to the room where the review committee will evaluate me. I\u0027ve been prepped by the other guys in my cell block. Sit up straight, look full of remorse, act polite, and all that stuff. But, to tell you the truth, how much can you trust guys who haven\u0027t gotten out themselves?\\n\\n As Jerry opens the door to the evaluation room, my muscles start to twitch and I\u0027m getting all sweaty beneath my state-issued coveralls, state-issued socks, and yep, even my state-issued briefs. Maybe I\u0027m not so ready for this after all.\\n\\n \"Please sit down, Caleb,\" orders a woman wearing glasses and a stern look on her face.\\n\\n I swear the scene is out of a bad movie. Seven people sitting behind six-foot-long tables in front of one lone metal chair.\\n\\n I sit on the cold, hard metal.\\n\\n \"As you know, we\u0027re here to evaluate your ability to leave here and begin your life as a free citizen.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I say. \"I\u0027m ready to leave.\"\\n\\n A big guy, who I can tell is going to play \"bad cop,\" puts his hand up. \"Whoa, slow down. We have a few questions to ask before we make our decision.\"\\n\\n Oh, man. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n Big Guy checks my file, flipping page after page. \"Tell me about the night of the accident.\"\\n\\n The one night in my life I want to erase from history. Taking a deep breath, I say, \"I was drinking at a party. I drove home, but lost control of the car. When I realized I hit someone, I freaked and drove back to the party.\"\\n\\n \"You knew the girl you hit?\"\\n\\n Memories assault me. \"Yes, sir. Maggie Armstrong ... my neighbor.\" I don\u0027t add she was my twin sister\u0027s best friend.\\n\\n \"And you didn\u0027t get out of the car to see if your neighbor was hurt?\"\\n\\n I shift in my chair. \"I guess I wasn\u0027t thinking straight.\"\\n\\n \"You guess?\" another committee member asks.\\n\\n \"If I could turn back time, I swear I would. I\u0027d change everything.\"\\n\\n They question me for another half hour and I spurt out answers. Why I was drinking while underage, why I\u0027d get into a car drunk, why I left the scene of the accident. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m saying the wrong thing or right thing, which puts me on edge. I\u0027m just being me ... seventeen-year-old Caleb Becker. If they believe me, I stand a chance of getting released early. If they don\u0027t... well, I\u0027ll be eating crappy food for another six months and continue rooming with convicts.\\n\\n Big Guy looks right at me. \"How do we know you won\u0027t go on another drinking binge?\"\\n\\n I sit up straight in my chair and direct my attention to each and every one of the committee members. \"No offense, but I never want to come back here again. I made a huge mistake, one that\u0027s haunted me day and night since I\u0027ve been here. Just... let me go home.\" For the first time in my life, I\u0027m tempted to grovel.\\n\\n Instead, I sit back and wait for another question.\\n\\n \"Caleb, please wait outside while we make our decision,\" the woman with the glasses says.\\n\\n And it\u0027s over. Just like that.\\n\\n I wait out in the hall. I\u0027m usually not a guy who breaks under pressure, and the past year in jail has definitely given me an invisible piece of armor I wear around me. But waiting for a group of strangers to decide your fate is majorly nerve-wracking. I wipe beads of perspiration off my forehead.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" guard Jerry says. \"If you didn\u0027t win them over, you might get another chance in a few months.\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" I mumble back, not consoled in the least.\\n\\n Jerry chuckles, the shiny silver handcuffs hanging off his belt clinking with each movement. The dude likes his job too much.\\n\\n We wait a half hour for someone to come out of the room and give me a sign of what\u0027s next. Freedom or more jail time?\\n\\n I\u0027m tired of being locked in my cell at night.\\n\\n I\u0027m tired of sleeping on a bunk bed with springs pushing into my back.\\n\\n And I\u0027m tired of being watched twenty-four hours a day by guards, personnel, cameras, and other inmates.\\n\\n The lady with the glasses opens the door. \"Caleb, we\u0027re ready for you.\"\\n\\n She isn\u0027t smiling. Is that a bad sign? I\u0027m bracing myself for bad news. I stand up and Jerry pats me on the back. A pity pat? Does he know something I don\u0027t? The suspense is freaking me out.\\n\\n I sit back on the metal chair. All eyes are on me. Big Guy folds his hands on the table and says, \"We all agree that your actions last year concerning the accident were reprehensible.\"\\n\\n I know that. I really know that.\\n\\n \"But we believe that was an isolated incident never to be repeated. You\u0027ve demonstrated positive leadership qualities with other inmates and worked hard on your jobs here. The review committee has decided to release you and have you finish out your sentence with one hundred and fifty hours of community service.\"\\n\\n Does that mean what I think it means? \"Release? As in I can leave here?\" I ask the Big Guy.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be meeting with your transition coach tomorrow morning. He\u0027ll arrange your community service duties and report your progress to us.\"\\n\\n Another member of the committee points a manicured finger at me. \"If you screw up, your transition counselor can petition the judge to bring you back here to serve out the rest of your sentence. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t give breaks to repeaters. Go back home, be a model citizen, finish your community service requirements, and have a good, clean life.\"\\n\\n I get it. \"I will,\" I say.\\n\\n When I get back to my cell, the only one here is the new kid. He\u0027s twelve and still cries all the time. Maybe he should\u0027ve thought twice before he buried a knife into the back of the girl who refused to go to the school dance with him.\\n\\n \"You ever gonna stop crying?\" I ask the kid.\\n\\n He\u0027s got his face in his pillow; I don\u0027t think he hears me. But then I hear a muffled, \"I hate this place. I want to go home.\"\\n\\n I change into my work boots because I get the pleasure of having to clean the dumpsters today. \"Yeah, me too,\" I say. \"But you\u0027re stuck here so you might as well suck it up and get with the program.\"\\n\\n The kid sits up, sniffles, and wipes his nose with the back of his hand. \"How long have you been here?\"\\n\\n \"Almost a year.\"\\n\\n That sets the kid plunging back into his pillow for more wailing. \"I don\u0027t want to be locked up for a year,\" he cries.\\n\\n Julio, another cell mate, walks into the room. \"Seriously, Caleb, if that kid doesn\u0027t shut up, I\u0027m gonna kill him. I haven\u0027t slept for three nights because of that crybaby.\"\\n\\n The wails stop, but then the sniffles start. Which are actually worse than the wailing.\\n\\n \"Julio, give the kid a break,\" I say.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too soft, Caleb. Gotta toughen these kids up.\"\\n\\n \"So they can be like you? No offense, man, but you\u0027d scare a serial killer,\" I say.\\n\\n One look at Julio and you know he\u0027s a tough guy. Tattoos all over his neck, back, and arms. Shaved head. When my mom comes for visits, she acts like his tattoos are contagious.\\n\\n \"So?\" Julio says. \"They gonna let you outta here?\" I sit on my bed. \"Yeah. Tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky sonofabitch. You goin\u0027 back to that small town with a funny name? Wha\u0027s it called again?\"\\n\\n \"Paradise.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ll be stuck here alone with crybaby while you\u0027re in Paradise? Ain\u0027t that a bitch.\" He gives the kid a wide-eyed stare. If I didn\u0027t know Julio better, I\u0027d be afraid, too.\\n\\n This sets the kid off again.\\n\\n Julio chuckles, then says \"Well, I\u0027ll give you the number to my cousin Rio in Chicago. If you need to hightail it out of Paradise, Rio will hook you up.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, man,\" I say.\\n\\n Julio shakes his head at the crying kid, says \"Later, amigo\" and leaves the open cell.\\n\\n I tap the kid on his shoulder. He jerks away, scared.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not gonna hurt you,\" I tell him.\\n\\n He turns to me. \"That\u0027s what they all say. I heard about what goes on in jails.\" He scoots his butt towards the wall.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t flatter yourself, kid. You\u0027re not my type. I like chicks.\"\\n\\n \"What about the guy with the tattoos?\" I fight the urge to laugh. \"He\u0027s hetero, too. Dude, you\u0027re in a juvenile facility.\"\\n\\n \"He said he\u0027ll kill me.\"\\n\\n \"He says that because he likes you,\" I assure him. Julio has a sick sense of humor. \"Now get off the bed, stop the crying, and go to group.\"\\n\\n Group is group therapy. Where all the inmates sit around and discuss personal shit about their lives.\\n\\n Tomorrow I\u0027m getting the hell out of this place. No more group. No more cellmates. No more crappy food. No more cleaning dumpsters.\\n\\n Tomorrow I\u0027m going home.\\n\\n TWO\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n I think physical therapists like their job a little too much. I mean, why do they always look so happy and smiley as they make you sweat and wince from pain?\\n\\n Sure enough, Robert, my physical therapist, is waiting for me with a big white-toothed smile in the lobby of the outpatient area of the hospital.\\n\\n \"Hi, Maggie. You ready to work that leg of yours?\" Not really. \"I guess so,\" I say, looking down at the floor. I know it\u0027s Robert\u0027s job to try and make me walk better. But there\u0027s no use in helping me walk normal because my leg is all messed up inside. The last surgery I had to fix my tibial plateau fracture lasted over seven hours. My orthopedic surgeon jokes with me and calls it a bionic leg.\\n\\n All I know is that I have more nails and plastic inside me than the average tool box.\\n\\n When I go to Spain next semester the screeners at the airport are going to have a field day with me. They\u0027ll probably ask me to climb inside the x-ray machine to make sure I\u0027m not concealing a weapon inside my knee.\\n\\n Robert escorts me into the physical therapy room. I have to come here twice a week. Twice a week for almost a year and still people stare at me when I walk.\\n\\n \"Maggie, lie down and put your foot on my shoulder,\" Robert instructs, getting down to business-as-usual.\\n\\n Sighing, I lay down on the mat and put my foot on Robert\u0027s shoulder. He holds my foot in place and leans forward. \"Put pressure on it.\"\\n\\n After the accident, all I can do is a little baby push.\\n\\n \"Come on, Maggie. You can do better than that. I hardly feel it.\"\\n\\n I put my forearm over my eyes. \"It\u0027s never going to get better than this.\"\\n\\n \"Sure it will. Look, you never believed you\u0027d be able to walk again and here you are.\"\\n\\n I put more pressure on my foot.\\n\\n \"Thatta girl. Rate your pain level right now from one to ten, ten being excruciating.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-1.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \\n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
