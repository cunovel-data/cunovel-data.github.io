{"id":86618,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"I nod. \"The Caleb Becker? Leah Becker\u0027s brother, Caleb Becker?\" I cock my head to the side and nod some more. Sabrina\u0027s mouth drops open and her eyes bug out. Like a shock wave, I realize Caleb had been right all along. Going to Spain was just a copout, a way to escape people and a way for me to forget the accident for a little while. But the accident happened. There is no way to forget it. And I limp. I have to face the fact I will never be the same as before. It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m okay. Taking a deep breath, I realize something... I feel stronger and more alive than I did before the accident. The door to the bathroom opens. Mrs. Gibbons walks into the bathroom. Her eyebrows go up when she witnesses our little confrontation. \"Aren\u0027t you all supposed to be in class?\" None of us answer. Kendra is staring at me, Hannah keeps looking from Kendra to me and back to Kendra, Sabrina still has her mouth open in shock, and I\u0027m not revealing anything. \"Okay, then. Let\u0027s all take a little trip to Mr. Meyer\u0027s office so he can get to the bottom of this.\" \"Fine with me,\" I say. \"Me, too,\" Sabrina says, backing me up. I owe a big apology to her for being such a jerk before the accident. Sometimes you have to steer away from the crowd in order to be a better person. It\u0027s not always easy, that\u0027s for sure. But it\u0027s right. And sometimes doing the right thing feels so good. Even if it does end up in a trip to the principal\u0027s office. Kendra\u0027s eyes are still spitting fire. \"Whatever.\" \"Yeah, whatever,\" Hannah says, doing an embarrassing imitation of her best friend. I almost feel sorry for her. We all follow Mrs. Gibbons to the front office. Sabrina is looking at me, wide-eyed. \"No way! Caleb Becker?\" she mouths silently. It\u0027s not Kendra\u0027s fault she\u0027s beautiful and pretty. It\u0027s not even Caleb\u0027s fault for being attracted to her. It doesn\u0027t even matter. What matters is that I\u0027m not carrying around feelings of hatred and betrayal. It\u0027s been too exhausting. Mrs. Reynolds was right. I don\u0027t hate Kendra. I don\u0027t hate Leah. I don\u0027t hate Caleb. I\u0027m feeling stronger than I have in ... well, I can\u0027t even remember when. All I know is that I feel good. No, better than that. I feel strong. FORTY-ONE Caleb Meyer points to me and jabs his finger into the air with each word as he says, \"Okay, Becker. In my office.\" I follow him into his office, then he closes the door once I\u0027m sitting in the chair opposite his desk. He\u0027s pissed off. I can tell by the way his neck muscles twitch and the colors of his face and bald head turn a deep shade of red. He doesn\u0027t even sit in his chair. He sits on the edge of his desk right over me. He\u0027s trying to be intimidating, to scare me into being a good kid. But he\u0027s never roomed with a guy like Julio. And if Julio didn\u0027t intimidate me, Meyer doesn\u0027t stand a chance. \"Why did you start a fight with Drew Rudolph?\" I can\u0027t tell him the truth. If the whole thing comes out, Leah could be dragged into this, too. And Kendra. And Maggie. Leah has been acting creepy. I don\u0027t know what she\u0027ll end up saying. Will she blurt out the truth, that she was the one who hit Maggie? \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say dumbly. Meyer\u0027s anger deflates while frustration takes its place. \"What am I going to do with you, Becker? I\u0027ve had a parent call and say you were responsible for coercing a peer into consuming alcohol. Another complaint was filed by the wrestling coach from Fremont ... something about you bullying one of his top wrestlers. You\u0027re on thin ice here, on the fast track to being a delinquent forever. Don\u0027t you understand the only person your behavior ultimately hurts is you? Unless you can explain yourself, I have no choice but to give you a suspension.\" Suspension? Oh, shit. I would defend myself, but it\u0027s no use. The guy wouldn\u0027t believe me, anyway. I stay silent. \"You have nothing to say about these accusations?\" \"Nope.\" \"Caleb, have a seat outside while I figure out how to proceed with this.\" So now I\u0027m stuck in another metal chair outside Meyer\u0027s office. Closed doors and metal chairs are the recurring themes in my life. I look up when the door to the front office opens. Maggie walks in the office, just feet from where I\u0027m sitting. Only able to check her out from the side, I study her face. She has high cheekbones and a straight nose. It\u0027s not small; it has a little bump in the middle, almost as if God wanted to put it there so her nose wouldn\u0027t be perfect. She wouldn\u0027t be Maggie without that imperfection. She\u0027s not in-your-face pretty like Kendra, but there\u0027s something about her ... that mix of insecurity and regal features that don\u0027t fit. Every one of her features reflects who she is. Except her scars. Those I wish I could take away with a touch of my fingers and transfer them to my own body. Maggie is focused on the counter, reading something intently. Her hair falls like a curtain shielding her face from me. I\u0027m barely aware of Sabrina, Kendra, and Hannah in the room, too. This place is getting crowded. Mrs. Gibbons, the art teacher, knocks on Meyer\u0027s door. She peeks her head inside when he barks for her to enter his sacred domain. \"We\u0027ve had a situation with some of the senior girls.\" The girls head single file into his office. Kendra looks defiant, Hannah looks scared, Sabrina looks indifferent, and Maggie is ... she seems resolved to handle whatever comes flying at her. The girls come out a few minutes later. Maggie doesn\u0027t look at me. She files out of the office with the rest of the girls. Meyer reappears at the door. \"Okay, Becker. Your turn.\" I go into his office and am directed to yet another chair. This one is padded. I rest my elbows on my knees and think of what Meyer said: I\u0027m on the fast track for being a delinquent forever. Maggie was probably right: if you disappear, then you don\u0027t have to always be reminded of the past wherever you turn. I did my community service, but haven\u0027t gotten my final release papers. Damon is seriously going to kill me when he finds out I got in a fight. What the hell is going to happen when I go back to the DOC? I hope Mom and Leah don\u0027t go over the edge. I hear the clicking of shoes and look up. My mother is standing in the doorway of Meyer\u0027s office. Her lips are tight. I can sense she has a loose rein on control because I see her wobbling slightly from side to side. \"Ah, Mrs. Becker,\" Meyer says. \"Thanks for coming so quickly.\" Mom nods and holds onto the door frame. \"So ... should I take him home?\" Meyer walks up to my mom and puts his hand on her shoulder to steady her. \"The boy whom Caleb assaulted has not filed any charges as yet, but policy forces me to keep him off school grounds until this is resolved. You\u0027ll get a call from me after I\u0027ve consulted the district superintendent to inform you of the length of Caleb\u0027s suspension.\" Mom nods, then focuses on me. She looks tired. The deep lines under her eyes and at the corners of her mouth look deeper than I\u0027ve ever seen them. I put those lines there. Without meaning to, I\u0027ve broken my mother\u0027s spirit. In the car, I\u0027ve got nothing to say. And when silent tears start dripping out of her tired eyes, all I want to do is escape. Because I can\u0027t tell her anything to make her feel better, I can\u0027t fight this snowball of bullshit that has become my life. I sit in my room until darkness falls, when someone knocks on my door. \"Caleb, open up,\" a familiar transition counselor\u0027s voice rings out. Great, now I get to be reamed out by Damon. \"Let me have it,\" I say dryly as I let him in. If you\u0027ve never seen a black guy\u0027s face get red with anger, you\u0027ve never seen Damon Manning pissed off. \"What the hell is going on? I got a call from your principal this afternoon telling me you\u0027re suspended for two weeks. You want to go back to the DOC?\" \"Sure. You got cuffs ready?\" I say, holding my arms out in front of me. Damon gets in my face, real close. \"Listen, punk, I have no problem slapping cuffs on you and hauling your ass back to prison. But I don\u0027t think you realize your eighteenth birthday is just around the corner. And you know what kind of eighteenth birthday present you get from the State of Illinois? You get transferred to the big boy jail. That\u0027s right, the adult place where the inmates rule, and not one day will go by that you won\u0027t be threatened or forced to do shit you\u0027ve only heard about. I don\u0027t want you in there, Caleb, because you\u0027ll go in a confused smartass boy and come out a hardened bastard. They\u0027ll eat you alive there and nobody can save your ass. You hear me? Now tell me why the hell you\u0027ve been getting into fights.\" I\u0027m so used to pleading guilty, I forget sometimes to tell the truth. I look Damon straight on, no playing around this time. \"I was protecting Maggie. Drew insulted her.\" Damon takes my desk chair and sits in it. He puts his hand on his forehead and starts rubbing it, kind of like Meyer did this afternoon. \"Caleb, what\u0027re you doing? She\u0027s your victim. You hit her with your car.\" \"I didn\u0027t do it.\" \"What?\" he snaps. \"I said I didn\u0027t mean to do it.\" Damon takes his hand off his forehead and leans forward. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to pull here, but it\u0027s not good. If you can\u0027t pretend Maggie doesn\u0027t exist, then leave town. She called my boss this morning expressing concern about her safety. She said you\u0027ve been sexual with her, and now that it\u0027s over you\u0027ve harassed her.\" \"What?\" Damon looks straight at me. \"Maggie Armstrong says she\u0027s filing a complaint. Oh, don\u0027t look so shocked, Caleb. What did you expect? When you don\u0027t follow the rules you pay the consequences. It\u0027s simple.\" Nothing is that simple. I swallow. My throat feels constricted. Maggie hates me enough to send me back to the DOC? \"I need to know,\" Damon continues. \"Did you have a sexual encounter with her?\" I sit on my bed and rest my head in my hands. Jeez, this cannot be happening. \"That depends on what you mean by a sexual encounter.\" \"Don\u0027t fuck with me, Becker.\" \"I didn\u0027t have sex with her.\" \"Did you harass her?\" I shake my head. \"We had a relationship, a mutual relationship. It was no big deal. It\u0027s over. Done.\" \"How did it end?\" \"Abruptly.\" Damon blows out a breath in frustration, then pulls out a stack of papers from his briefcase. \"I got your release papers signed. You finished your community service.\" I stare at the papers as if they have angels\u0027 wings on them, but my head is still reeling. I thought what Maggie and I shared was ... well, it was a hell of a lot more than I ever had with Kendra. If Maggie hooked up with me just for revenge ... oh, hell. \"You\u0027re released, but we have a bit of a problem. You can\u0027t go back to school. Caleb?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Everybody isn\u0027t against you, you know.\" I nod. Right now, I can\u0027t agree. I was so pumped to fix everything when I returned home. But all I\u0027ve been doing is fighting instead of fixing. I\u0027m at a loss here. After Damon leaves, I head to the kitchen. Mom is leaning against the sink. She\u0027s shaking as she takes a bunch of pills and swallows them with a gulp of water. \"Mom, what are you doing?\" \"Taking medication for tension and stress.\" I snatch the bottle of pills off the counter. \"Give me that back,\" she orders. Taking a closer look at the drug\u0027s name on the bottle. Diazepam. Valium. \"How long have you been taking these?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-28.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
