He glances at me before saying, \"Caleb went through the academic program at the, uh, Department of Corrections.\"\\n\\n Meyer puts a hand up. \"That may be, Dr. Becker. But he didn\u0027t pass social studies or rack up enough credits to be a senior.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m going to say what I\u0027ve been wanting to say all along, to hell with the consequences. \"I could just drop out.\"\\n\\n Mom frowns. \"Caleb, no.\" Yeah, a real live public reaction!\\n\\n Dad\u0027s eyebrows furrow. \"Son, you\u0027re not dropping out. I\u0027m sure Mr. Meyer can work something out. Right?\"\\n\\n The guy takes a deep breath and pulls out yet another folder, which seriously makes me want to laugh. He studies the contents while we all wait in silence. \"Well, I could put him into a junior level social studies but keep all of his other subjects at the senior level.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a wonderful idea,\" Mom shrieks.\\n\\n Dad nods.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll have to take summer school and graduate late. It\u0027s not ideal but--\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine, isn\u0027t it, Caleb?\"\\n\\n Oh, man. Summer school? Why don\u0027t they just stick bamboo under my fingernails instead? \"Whatever it takes, Dad.\"\\n\\n I stare out the window at the cars driving past the school and birds flying to who knows where.\\n\\n \"Caleb, why don\u0027t you get a class schedule from my secretary,\" the principal says, then checks his watch. \"You can catch the last half of third period if you hurry.\"\\n\\n Dad and Mom are silent as we exit Meyers office.\\n\\n The secretary hands me a piece of paper. \"Here\u0027s your class schedule.\"\\n\\n I walk to senior English. Leave it to old Meyer to make me enter the classroom smack in the middle of class. I wince as I open the door.\\n\\n I can almost hear an announcer\u0027s voice in my head. Yes, ladies and gentleman, the main attraction ... straight from juvenile jail... Caleb Becker! I feel sixty eyes on me, burning into my skull as I walk up to the teacher, Mr. Edelsen. \"Can I help you?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in this class.\"\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n Eyes.\\n\\n Muscles tightening. \"Well, have a seat then.\"\\n\\n I walk to the back of the class and pick a seat next to Drew Rudolph. We used to hang out. You know ... before.\\n\\n After class I have lunch. I pay for an apple and Coke from money my parents gave me this morning. As I walk through the lunchroom, I hold my head high. Let them talk about the ex-con all they want. Facing these kids is nothing compared to the guys at the DOC.\\n\\n When I turn the corner, I bump into Kendra. It\u0027s the first time we\u0027ve been this close since my arrest.\\n\\n \"Hi, Caleb,\" she says with a teasing lilt to her voice. \"Drew told me he saw you in English class.\" I nod.\\n\\n \"Remember when we had English together?\"\\n\\n Boy, do I. We used to take bathroom breaks at the same time and meet in some deserted hallway to make out and feel each other up. \"I remember.\"\\n\\n She smiles at me with her bright teeth and killer full lips. I could have kissed those lips forever. I still can.\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I\u0027ll catch you later,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Later,\" I say, watching her butt sway as she walks away.\\n\\n After school, for community service, I fixed an old lady\u0027s fence and hung up her light fixture.\\n\\n Before I got convicted I\u0027d come home to find at least ten messages from Kendra, begging me to call. But this time I got home and the answering machine only had one message ... from Damon.\\n\\n I called him back. Our conversation went like this.\\n\\n \"Caleb?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Good job today. On time and everything. \"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Keep it up. I\u0027ll call in two days.\"\\n\\n Woo hoo! He\u0027ll leave me alone for a whopping two days. My dad is working late tonight so it\u0027s only me, my mom, and Leah. Leah is pushing her food around on her plate, not really eating. Mom is too busy yakking to her friends on the phone. I don\u0027t think she even realizes Leah and I are sitting at the table with her. I\u0027m thankful when everyone in my house is sleeping. It\u0027s the only time it resembles the old days.\\n\\n At night I\u0027m lying in my bed, staring at the clock like I\u0027ve been doing for the past two hours. Three o\u0027clock in the morning. I can\u0027t sleep. Too many thoughts running through my useless head. Maybe I need an uncomfortable and overly used mattress like I had in the DOC in order to get a full night of sleep.\\n\\n Throwing the covers back, I stand up and pace my bedroom. The picture of Kendra on my headboard is staring back at me, her smile a secret promise between the two of us. I snatch the cordless phone from the living room and take it back to my bedroom.\\n\\n I dial Kendra\u0027s number, her private line that only rings in her bedroom, but I hang up before it rings. What if she\u0027s dating someone else and doesn\u0027t want to talk to me? I sure as hell don\u0027t want to be running after her if she\u0027s hanging with another guy.\\n\\n I look out the window, gauging how long it\u0027ll be until the sun comes creeping up. In the DOC, there were always guys who couldn\u0027t sleep. You could see them across the way sitting in their bunks, or you could hear them tossing and turning. The new guys and youngest kids had the hardest time. They\u0027d be crying silently, the only indication being a random sniffle or shoulders slumped over and shaking. Even though some of them were just twelve or thirteen, they tried to act like men.\\n\\n But they were, in the end, just boys.\\n\\n I notice a light turn on in Maggie\u0027s bedroom, the glow outlining the curtains covering her window. I have computer class with her, but usually I sit in the back while she takes a seat in the front row. I keep my head down because the kids in class are analyzing my every move. When the bell rings, Maggie is the first one out ... sometimes I think she\u0027s out of there before the bell even rings. Does she think she\u0027s the only one affected by the accident?\\n\\n FOURTEEN\\n\\n Maggie\\n\\n I can\u0027t sleep after my nightmares and have to turn my light on to stay awake. At least this time I didn\u0027t wake Mom up screaming.\\n\\n This nightmare was different. Kendra Greene drove the car, not Caleb. In all my other nightmares, it\u0027s Caleb at the wheel of the car that hit me.\\n\\n I guess it\u0027s because I saw Kendra talking to Caleb in the cafeteria yesterday. He didn\u0027t see me because I sit right next to the doors so I can leave as soon as I\u0027ve finished eating.\\n\\n The cafeteria is a strange place. The populars can be spotted right away. They\u0027re loud and laugh a lot. The regular people sit in their own cliques, totally separate from the popular lunch tables.\\n\\n I used to be a popular. Most athletes in Paradise are populars. But now I\u0027m a loner who doesn\u0027t even mingle with the regulars, not even the lowest ones.\\n\\n Loners sit by themselves, scattered throughout the lunchroom. They eat alone, then make their hasty exits.\\n\\n I never knew where the loners went to, they just disappeared during lunch hour. But now that I am a loner I know that secret place.\\n\\n The school library. It\u0027s the mysterious place you can go to and not be seen.\\n\\n Caleb isn\u0027t afraid of attention. He walked right into the cafeteria yesterday, his head held high as if he was Mr. Meyer himself. Then he went right up to Kendra Greene and said something to make her smile. I swear everyone in the room was silent, watching them reunite. Does he know Brian and Kendra are a couple? The way Caleb stared at her butt when she walked away from him makes me think he\u0027s oblivious to what\u0027s been going on since he was in jail. Some things haven\u0027t changed.\\n\\n I pull back my window curtains and stare out at Caleb\u0027s window. It\u0027s a little past three a.m. He\u0027s probably sleeping like a baby without a care in the world.\\n\\n But he\u0027s not. His light is on and I see his silhouette pacing his room.\\n\\n I let the curtains fall back to cover the window, turn the light off, and hurry back to bed. I can\u0027t fall into old habits, not now after everything that\u0027s happened.\\n\\n The reality is I had a crush on Caleb since first grade.\\n\\n He used to tease Leah and me as we played with our Barbie dolls and dressed up in costumes. But when we needed a boy to play a part in one of our shows, we could always coerce him into acting the part. And if we made up a ballet show, we could count on him to be an audience member as we jeté\u0027d and plié\u0027d our hearts out in front of him.\\n\\n But the time I fell head over heels in love with Caleb Becker was in sixth grade, when he took the blame after I broke his mom\u0027s ceramic statue of an owl that had been given to her great-great-grandmother from some former U.S. president.\\n\\n Leah was upstairs getting ready and I was waiting for her in their living room. We were going to play tennis at the park. Caleb surprised me by flying down the stairs with a Star Wars lightsaber in his hand, waving it around. I laughed and put up my racquet as a weapon, challenging him. He came at me with the saber, and I swung my racquet to ward off his attack. I counted on whacking his saber, not the ceramic owl on his mom\u0027s credenza.\\n\\n His mother heard the crash and came running. Caleb said it was his fault, that he was playing around with the saber. He never named me as the one who broke the statue; he didn\u0027t even name me as an accomplice. I was too scared at the time to tell the truth, even when I knew he got grounded for a whole month. Without even realizing it, he became my hero.\\n\\n After that, I used to watch Caleb through my window when he played catch with his friends or had Boy Scout\\n\\n meetings in his backyard. When we were in seventh grade he started mowing the lawn while listening to music. I could hardly concentrate on my homework while I watched him weave back and forth across the lawn with the mower, his muscles bunching through his t-shirt as he gathered grass clippings and shoved them into garbage bags.\\n\\n Sometimes he\u0027d catch me looking at him and wave. Sometimes I tentatively waved back, but then I\u0027d close my curtains and keep them closed for a week so he\u0027d never know how I really felt about him. Other times I\u0027d pretend I didn\u0027t see him, although I suppose he knew I\u0027d been spying.\\n\\n Caleb never let on that he liked me more than a friend. That was okay by me. I just kept up hope that one day he\u0027d see me as a girl and not his twin sister\u0027s pesky friend.\\n\\n He had girlfriends over the years, but was never serious about any of them.\\n\\n Until Kendra.\\n\\n They started dating in the beginning of our freshman year. Kendra hung out at his house every day after school; they were inseparable from the start. Every time I happened to glance out my window and spot them in an intimate embrace, my hopeful heart crumbled little by little.\\n\\n That was also about the time my dad left. So here I was, desperately waiting for my dad and Caleb to love me as much as I loved them.\\n\\n What could I do to make the ones I loved love me back? The only thing I was good at was tennis. So I practiced and played and challenged myself every day during\\n\\n the summer between our freshman and sophomore year. Surely, once Caleb saw I was the only sophomore on the varsity squad, he\u0027d notice me.\\n\\n And I sent my dad articles from the local paper about my success, never forgetting to add the tennis coach\u0027s prediction that I\u0027d make it to the Illinois state championship in October.\\n\\n That season my dad never saw me play.\\n\\n That season was also when Caleb lost his virginity to Kendra.\\n\\n Once, just once, I saw them having sex one night under a blanket in his backyard. I never told anyone, although I could have sworn Caleb looked up at my window and knew I\u0027d been watching.\\n\\n He never said anything to me about it. And I never told Leah. She\u0027d be grossed out anyway. In fact, after that I felt so embarrassed I stopped watching Caleb. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-9.html","bookId":2771,"book":{"id":2771,"title":"Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1)","description":"Storyline: Leaving Paradise (Leaving Paradise #1) \\n Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong.
