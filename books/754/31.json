I tell you, we’ve got the hottest team in Ohio right here in Elkton.” \n \n “You must have a hot team to beat those fellows. I’ve seen them play. They got away with the Chicagos two out of three games in Los Angeles.” \n \n “Well, I rather think our boys might do better than that,” said the clerk, throwing out his chest. \n \n Raybold smiled a bit. \n \n “Many queer things happen in baseball,” he said. “Your team is not a straight local nine?” \n \n “Oh, no,” was the proud answer. “We’ve got a salaried team. That is,” he hastily added, “three men are on salary. The others are employed in town. One of them is a bell boy here in this hotel.” \n \n The Northern Securities man shook his head in a puzzled manner. \n \n “And such a team got away with Frank Merriwell’s nine?” he said. “I don’t understand it.” \n \n The cigar clerk was touched. \n \n “You don’t seem to understand,” he said. “Elkton has a team that can make any of ’em hustle. You ought to see our pitcher. He’s from Wisconsin. His name is Wolfers. Mark what I’m telling you, he’ll be in one of the big leagues within two years. I think he’s a better man than Cy Young or Chesbro, or any of them fellows. He uses the spit ball, and he can put it just where he wants to, which is better than some of the pitchers can do.” \n \n At this moment Bob Wolfers, accompanied by Jack Lawrence and Seymour Whittaker, a local baseball enthusiast and a man of wealth, entered the hotel. \n \n “Oh, your pitcher may be a good man,” said Raybold, taking his cigar from his mouth and examining it critically: “but you ought to know that Frank Merriwell is, beyond doubt, the cleverest slab artist not gobbled up by one of the two big leagues. The Boston Americans and the New York Nationals both want him.” \n \n “Is that straight, mister?” asked Wolfers, butting in and winking at the cigar clerk. \n \n “Yes, that’s straight.” \n \n “I suppose you know it for a fact?” \n \n “I suppose I do.” \n \n “Well, that fellow wouldn’t last twenty seconds on either the Bostons or the New Yorks. He’s the greatest shine for a pitcher that I ever saw.” \n \n Raybold flushed a bit and chewed at the end of his cigar, while he surveyed Wolfers from head to foot. \n \n “I presume you’re competent to judge?” he said. \n \n “I presume I am.” \n \n “It’s a fine thing for a man to have a high estimation of his ability as a judge. Who are you?” \n \n “My name is Wolfers.” \n \n “Oh-ho! I see! Professional jealousy. A case of sour grapes.” \n \n Wolfers laughed derisively. \n \n “Why should it be a case of sour grapes? Merriwell got his medicine all right to-day.” \n \n “Did you ever get bumped?” \n \n “What has that got to do with it? All pitchers get hit occasionally.” \n \n “That’s right; and, therefore, I claim that you can’t judge Merriwell’s ability by one game. Probably it will be different in the next game.” \n \n “There will be no next game,” said the manager. \n \n “How is that?” \n \n “One game wound us up with those chaps.” \n \n “Don’t you dare play them another?” \n \n “Dare? Ha! ha! ha! That’s a joke! Look here, my friend, there’s nothing we’re afraid to hitch up with.” \n \n “Then why don’t you give them another chance at you?” \n \n “Because we have games arranged for the rest of this week, and we expect to be playing in the league again by the first of next week. We can’t bother with small fry. We play out of town to-morrow and next day, and the Cuban Giants meet us here Saturday.” \n \n “I like the way you talk about small fry!” exclaimed Raybold, the tone of his voice indicating that he did not like it. \n \n “Besides,” said Lawrence, “I don’t fancy Merriwell or any of his crowd want to tackle us again.” \n \n “That’s where you make a mistake,” said a quiet voice, as Frank entered the office, limping the least bit. “We’re very anxious to get another game with you, Mr. Lawrence. We think we might reverse the result of to-day.” \n \n Raybold’s eyes twinkled. He recognized Frank at once, but, having never met him, he did not speak. Lawrence shrugged his shoulders. \n \n “It seems to me you ought to be satisfied, Merriwell,” he said. “You got your bumps to-day, didn’t you?” \n \n “You certainly hit me enough,” confessed Frank. \n \n “Still you are anxious for more. Some people never know when they’ve got enough.” \n \n This kind of talk was most annoying, but Merriwell had perfect self-control. \n \n “That’s right,” he acknowledged. “Perhaps I’m one of that kind.” \n \n “Well, out of pity for you, we shouldn’t think of making another game with you, even if we had the opportunity.” \n \n “Look here,” chipped in Raybold, a trifle warmly, “I believe you’re troubled with cold feet. That’s what’s the matter! You’re so pleased over this victory that you want to boast about it.” \n \n This angered Lawrence, who declared that it was nothing to boast about and made a great deal of talk to that effect. When he had finished, Raybold said: \n \n “I’ll wager a hundred dollars even with any man that you can’t defeat Merriwell’s team in another game.” \n \n Seymour Whittaker pricked up his ears. \n \n “What’s that?” he asked. “Your money would feel good in my pocket.” \n \n “Do you take my bet?” \n \n Lawrence turned quickly to Whittaker. \n \n “No use to bet,” he said. “We can’t give them another game. They’ll have to swallow their defeat and make the best of it.” \n \n “The best of it, or the worst of it,” laughed Wolfers. “Too bad they feel so sore. They were outclassed, that’s all.” \n \n “I’m sorry I can’t win that hundred off you, sir,” said Whittaker to Raybold. “It would be easy money for me.” \n \n Lawrence then inquired if Sprowl was in his room at the hotel, and, being told at the desk that he was, he proceeded upstairs, followed by Wolfers and Whittaker. \n \n “It’s unfortunate that these fellows will give you no chance to get even, Mr. Merriwell,” said Raybold. “They must be afraid of you.” \n \n “I hardly think that,” said Merry. “The game to-day could not have frightened them, although it was close until the finish of the ninth inning. They have perfect confidence in themselves. As you are a stranger, it was a surprise to me when you offered to back us in that manner.” \n \n “Oh, we’ve never met, but I’ve seen you pitch. I was out West a short time ago. Have you the same team you had in California and Colorado?” \n \n “Just the same, except that we’re one substitute short. Stretcher has gone home.” \n \n “How did you happen to lose to-day? Was it bad fielding behind you?” \n \n “No, sir. In the ninth I failed to make a hit, with two men on the bags. On the other hand, when their turn came, they did get the hit needed, likewise having two men on the sacks. That’s about how it happened.” \n \n In this manner Frank shouldered the burden. He made no reference to his lame ankle, nor did he explain that he had entered the box after Morgan’s arm gave out. \n \n “That was hard luck!” exclaimed Raybold. “Could you beat them to-morrow?” \n \n “No man can predict what will happen in baseball. Look at the poor showing the Boston Americans made at the opening of the season, just when every one expected great things of them. There are no sure things in baseball that is worth being called baseball.” \n \n “Of course we all realize that. Evidently you are not satisfied to leave Elkton without another try at the team here.” \n \n “Hardly satisfied. Quite the contrary.” \n \n “Well, can’t you drive them into giving you a game?” \n \n “I don’t know how. You’ve just heard their manager refuse.” \n \n “Yes, but men frequently change their minds. Keep at him. Give me permission to see what I can do. Will you?” \n \n “Well——” \n \n “Of course I mean on my own responsibility. I’ll not represent you.” \n \n “I couldn’t think of permitting that, in case you tried to get a game through a wager. I can’t prevent you from betting as much as you choose on your own responsibility.” \n \n “I understand your position. I believe I heard once that betting was against your principles. You seem to have taken a decided stand on that matter. It’s rather peculiar for a young fellow in your position, but I admire you for it. Stick by your principles, say I. I have a theory that it is wrong for a man to do anything he believes to be wrong. Another man may not consider it wrong, and, therefore, for him it may be all right.” \n \n “That’s a dangerous doctrine to preach, as it’s likely to be misunderstood. I have no doubt but there are men who do not consider it wrong to lie or cheat; but——” \n \n “Oh, beyond a certain limit my theory does not apply. It applies to some mooted questions. Lying and cheating are things no man can make right by thinking or pretending to think they are right. But you know some strait-laced persons believe attending the theatre on Sunday is wrong. For them it is wrong. I see no harm in it. I feel that it frequently does me good. For me it is all right.” \n \n “How about playing cards on Sunday?” \n \n “I see no harm in it. Do you?” \n \n “Yes,” answered Frank honestly. “Even if I did not think it harmed me, I would not do it on account of the example I might be placing before others. A man has to consider that.” \n \n “If he considers everything of that sort, he’ll find himself robbed of much of the pleasure in this life.” \n \n “A man can have plenty of pleasure without resorting to license. This life can be enjoyed in a good, healthy way, and the person who takes care not to set a bad example for others enjoys it more than one who is careless and indifferent. I do not believe any young man of my years ever enjoyed life more than I; yet I have been conscientious in many things on account of the example I might be setting before others. It is possible I might drink without harming myself, but I know there are fellows on my baseball team who could not drink without doing themselves serious injury. If I drank, several of them might drink. Could I be contented and undisturbed if I saw them forming the habit through following in my footsteps?” \n \n “Well, you put up a great argument, and you’ve given me something new to think about. Just the same, if I can drive Elkton into playing another game with you through betting that you’ll defeat them, I am going to do it. The sandy gentleman was inclined to snap up the hundred I offered. He must have some influence in baseball circles. I propose to keep after him. Leave it to me. On what terms did you play to-day?” \n \n “Two-thirds of the net gate money went to the winners.” \n \n “Good crowd?” \n \n “Fine.” \n \n “Your share will pay your bills?” \n \n “It ought to.” \n \n “Well, if you can get two-thirds in the next game, even if you have to wait several days before you play, you may not lose anything.” \n \n “I’m willing to wait and lose money if I can get the game.” \n \n Raybold found another opportunity that evening to make some betting talk to Seymour Whittaker. \n \n Whittaker professed a strong desire to wager money on the Elks, but said he could not, as Lawrence would not consider making another game with the Merries. \n \n “Are you one of the directors of the team?” asked Raybold. \n \n “Yes, sir.” \n \n “It seems that you might have some influence with him.” \n \n “Not enough to cause him to change his mind. He’s very set. It’s a good thing for you. I’d feel like a robber after taking your money.” \n \n “Would you, indeed?” laughed Raybold. “Well, see here, my dear man, I’ll give you a perfect snap. I’ll wager two hundred to one hundred that you cannot defeat the Merries again, the game to be played here any time next week, with a fair and impartial umpire.” \n \n “Why don’t you give me your money!” cried Whittaker. “You might as well.” \n \n “What do you say? Two hundred to one hundred.” \n \n “No use. It can’t be done, and you’re in luck.” \n \n “When does your local paper appear?” \n \n “Thursday.” \n \n “I’m going to insert a notice in the paper to the effect that the Elkton team does not dare give Merriwell another chance.” \n \n “Don’t be so foolish!” \n \n “Look the paper over when it comes out,” said Raybold. “You’ll find the notice.” \n \n Raybold was in earnest. He really did insert a notice in the local paper, paying advertising rates for the privilege. This notice was sarcastically worded and reflected on the courage of the local team in refusing to give the Merries another game. It called attention to the fact that the Merries had on their tour defeated far better known and much stronger teams than the Elks, while it further stated that no team could draw such a crowd, all of Elkton being desirous of witnessing another “go” with the visitors who had given the locals such a tussle the first time. \n \n There was something about this notice that aroused the pride and indignation of the Elktonites. The village hummed over it. The citizens began to tell one another that the Elks must give Frank Merriwell’s team another chance. \n \n The Elks were playing in another town, but Lawrence was called up on the phone by two or three persons who asked him why he did not play the Merries again. \n \n Frank had not known Raybold intended to insert the notice. After the notice appeared Merry kept still and awaited results. \n \n He had lingered in Elkton with his team, hoping another game could be secured. \n \n Seymour Whittaker was indignant. He looked around for Raybold and demanded to know why the people of Elkton had been insulted. Raybold laughed and said no insult was intended. Whittaker insisted that the newspaper notice plainly insinuated that the Elktonites were afraid their team would be beaten if it met the Merries again. \n \n “It looks that way to me,” said Raybold. \n \n “You know we’re not afraid.” \n \n “Prove it.” \n \n “We will!” cried Whittaker. “I’ll have the directors of the team get together. They can instruct Lawrence to arrange for the game. Then I presume you’ll squeal on that betting talk you’ve made.” \n \n “Hardly.” \n \n “Put your money up now, then.” \n \n “All right.” \n \n “Two hundred to one.” \n \n “That’s what I offered. If the game is not played, the bet is off.” \n \n They went out and found a stakeholder. The money was put up. \n \n On Saturday the Elks returned home and the famous Cuban Giants appeared to play them. \n \n The Cuban Giants is one of the strongest colored teams in the country, and the people of Elkton believed the real test of the locals would come in the game with the Giants. \n \n Merry knew the directors of the team had held a meeting for the purpose of considering the advisability of playing again with his team, but he could learn nothing as to the result of that meeting. \n \n Somehow, after returning to Elkton, Lawrence kept away from Frank, who saw him for the first time Saturday on the baseball field just before the beginning of the game with the Giants. \n \n In the presence of the assembled spectators, Frank walked out to the bench and spoke to the Elkton manager, asking if he had decided to give him another game. \n \n “Merriwell,” said Lawrence disagreeably, “I never saw a fellow so persistent in seeking a second drubbing. We’ll play you Monday, on one condition.” \n \n “Name it.” \n \n “The winning team shall take all the gate money.” \n \n “Agreed!” said Frank, with a promptness that surprised Lawrence. “It’s settled!” \n \n “You won’t get a dollar.” \n \n “Don’t worry about me. Will you announce the game here to-day? It will be the best sort of an advertisement.” \n \n “Yes, I’ll announce it.” \n \n As Frank walked away, Lawrence turned to Wolfers, chuckling: \n \n “Didn’t I work that cleverly? The directors instructed me to give him another game. I’d had to have done so on an even break, fifty per cent. to each team, if he had insisted; but I kept away from him and made him so eager he was willing to take terms of any sort. We’ll get all the boodle.” \n \n Cutts went in to pitch the game, and for five innings he had the heavy-hitting colored boys at his mercy. In the sixth inning he went to pieces and gave the Giants five base bits, which netted three runs. \n \n At that time the Elks had five scores. \n \n Wolfers warmed up at once. \n \n He was greeted with tumultuous cheers when he walked out to pitch at the beginning of the sixth. \n \n The colored boys were stayers. They laughed heartily over the applause given Wolfers. \n \n “We’ll put him into the stable quicker than we did the other fellow,” said the captain of the Giants. “Get right after him, boys. Knock his eye out. He’s a man with a swelled head. You can see it in the way he walks.” \n \n But when Wolfers struck out the first three batters to face him, pitching only eleven balls, they began to realize that they were up against a wizard. \n \n The joy of the spectators was boundless. The man from Wisconsin was cheered madly as he struck out the third man. \n \n “That’s all right,” declared one of the Giants. “We’ll fall on his neck next inning.” \n \n “Oh, yes you will!” derisively roared a big man. “You’ll fall on his neck—I don’t think!” \n \n Lawrence seized the opportunity as a favorable one to make an announcement. Walking out to the home plate, he held up his hand for silence. \n \n “Ladies and gentlemen,” he called, “I wish to inform you that there will be another game here in Elkton Monday afternoon at the usual hour.” \n \n “Hooray!” bellowed the big man. “I’ll quit work to come! You can’t give us too much of this kind of baseball!” \n \n “It seems,” said the manager of the Elks, smiling, “that some baseball players are greedy to be trimmed. They don’t know when they have enough. Our first game with Frank Merriwell’s Athletic Team resulted in a victory for us. The Merries were not satisfied. Mr. Merriwell has boned us into giving him another game. We intend to give him all he wants. I understand that Merriwell himself will pitch for his team. Bob Wolfers will do the pitching for us, and——” \n \n What a yell went up! \n \n “Oh, that’s a shame!” howled the big man, as the uproar subsided somewhat. “Why don’t you give them a chance? It isn’t fair!” \n \n “We propose to show you just what kind of a game we can put up with Wolfers in the box,” said Lawrence. “We promise you your money’s worth. Don’t miss it.” \n \n “We won’t!” they cried. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1950/55835.html","bookId":754,"book":{"id":754,"title":"Frank Merriwell\u0027s Endurance","description":"简介： On the way East with his athletic team Frank Merriwell accepted the invitation made by Hugh Morton to stop off at Omaha and visit the Midwestern Athletic Association....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1950","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:15 AM"}}
