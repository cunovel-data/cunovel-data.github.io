She did not look back, although an expression of disappointment came from her hidden lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Lucky for him he moved lively,” said Frank, as she sank down at his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Some evil charm protects him!” breathed the mysterious woman. “I did not wish to kill him—then. I hoped to drive over him and maim him!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is plain that you have no liking for the man.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Like him? I loathe and detest the sight of his wicked face, his treacherous eyes and his cruel mouth! When I behold him something in my heart struggles and burns until it is only by the utmost restraint that I keep myself from flying at him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He has done you a great wrong?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, me and one dearest to me in all the world.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He knows you, and that is why you keep yourself veiled?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He has never seen my face.” \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time the driver had quieted and restrained the frightened horse, and Merry looked back. He saw at a distance his companions making all haste in that direction, and he knew Cameron had not interfered with them, which gave him a feeling of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The boys are coming,” he said. “I thought that man might try to stop them.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The woman directed the driver to pull the horse down to a walk, which he succeeded in doing. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I do not wish to seem inquisitive,” said Merry; “but it is no more than natural that I should be greatly interested in Carey Cameron after what has happened.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Quite natural,” admitted the woman. “He is a gambler.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I thought it by his appearance.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He has traveled much, making his living by gambling. His former home was here, and he returned here a few months ago. As a boy he was a baseball enthusiast, and that explains his wonderful interest in the game. When he came back here he sided with the vicious element, and I believe he has been appointed manager of the team they mean to put in the place of the one organized by Gaddis. I do not know much about it, but I have learned that they believe this team will be able to defeat anything in these parts. He has secured a number of players blacklisted in the big leagues. Cameron will run the team to make money for himself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How can he make money out of baseball in a town like this?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He will gamble on the games.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But if he has a team that is far superior to any team it meets he’ll find no one to bet on the other teams.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “When that happens he will bet on the other teams himself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You mean——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That I know his treacherous nature. He will betray his friends. He’ll not wager money openly on an opposing team. It is likely he will openly bet small sums on his own team. His supposed-to-be friends will do the betting. Some agent of Cameron will bet Cameron’s money, and you may be sure that his team will lose that game.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “In short, he will double-cross his friends, and that is the worst form of treachery.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That man is capable of anything, Mr. Merriwell! To carry out his ends he would commit murder!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He’ll reach the end of his rope some day.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I trust that day is not far in the future!” \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time they had reached the outskirts of the town. The road led up a low hill, near the crest of which, set back amid some trees, could be seen a rather gloomy-looking house. This house the mysterious woman indicated with a slight gesture, explaining that they were bound thither. \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is your home?” questioned Merry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “For the time being it serves me as home,” she replied. “I have occupied it two months.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You do not belong in this town?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No; before coming here two months ago I had never seen the place. I shall be happy when I leave it to return no more.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You do not like Cartersville?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I detest the place! It is run by hoodlums and ruffians. There are some respectable people here, but the vicious element predominates, and respectable people are afraid to stand up for their rights.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “A fine place in which to play baseball!” laughed Merry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “No worse place in Iowa.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Perhaps it is just as well that we are not going to play here.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You are better off.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys were not far behind when they reached the gate and turned into the grounds surrounding the gloomy house amid the trees. The house was shuttered, and many of the shutters were closed. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the front step Merry sprang from the carriage and assisted his strange companion to alight. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the others of his party came up Frank said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Fellows, although this lady has been kind enough to offer us the shelter of her house, I fear we are intruding in a certain way. I am sure we are putting her to great inconvenience, and I wish to——” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mr. Merriwell,” interrupted the veiled woman, “I have tried to make it plain that you are not placing me at any inconvenience. I will add that my circumstances are such that the sum you may pay me for the accommodation of yourself and friends will be very acceptable. Oh! I’m going to take pay! You may give whatever sum you choose; I am satisfied that it will be satisfactory. I think this should put you more at your ease.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “To a certain extent it does,” admitted Merry. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then come in.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The woman turned toward the door, which opened at once. As Merry followed her he saw the door had been opened by a singularly grave-looking Chinaman. \\n\\n \\n\\n “John,” said the mysterious woman, “these are my guests.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Velly well, miss,” nodded the Celestial. \\n\\n \\n\\n “They will remain as long as they choose and are to have the best the house affords while here.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Velly well, miss.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Take them upstairs and let them select their own rooms.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Velly well, miss.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, turning to Frank, the woman said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Dinner will be served in an hour. I think you will be ready by that time.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yah,” muttered Hans. “I vos readiness alretty soon.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you wish to send to the station for anything in the way of baggage I will call a man to attend to that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “There is nothing at the station that we shall need to-night,” said Frank. “We had better leave our stuff there. We have everything necessary for present wants in our hand bags.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Show them up, John.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Velly well, miss.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They followed the Chinaman of the solemn and respectful manner and the limited vocabulary. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1950/55817.html","bookId":754,"book":{"id":754,"title":"Frank Merriwell\u0027s Endurance","description":"简介： On the way East with his athletic team Frank Merriwell accepted the invitation made by Hugh Morton to stop off at Omaha and visit the Midwestern Athletic Association....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1950","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:15 AM"}}
