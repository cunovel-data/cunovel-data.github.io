Dr. Ellie Sullivan has just completed her residency at a large urban hospital. While jogging in a park nearby, she witnesses the shooting of an FBI agent in pursuit of wanted criminals, a couple identified as the Landrys. The only person to see the shooter\u0027s face, Ellie is suddenly at the center of a criminal investigation. Agent Max Daniels takes over the Landry case. A no-nonsense lawman, he\u0027s definitely not the ideal man that Ellie has always imagined, yet she\u0027s attracted to him in a way she can\u0027t explain. Ellie heads home to Winston Falls, South Carolina, to attend her sister\u0027s wedding. Shortly after she arrives, though, she receives a surprise visitor: Max Daniels. The Landrys have been captured, and she\u0027ll be called to testify. But they\u0027ve been captured before, and each time the witnesses are scared into silence-or disappear before they can take the stand. Max vows to be Ellie\u0027s shadow until the trial, and it isn\u0027t long before sparks fly.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:41 PM"}},{"id":88685,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9/page-18.html","bookId":1828,"book":{"id":1828,"title":"The Ideal Man (Buchanan-Renard #9)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood delivers a contemporary romance that\u0027s pulse-pounding in every sense of the word.

The only person to see the shooter\u0027s face, Ellie is suddenly at the center of a criminal investigation. Agent Max Daniels takes over the Landry case. A no-nonsense lawman, he\u0027s definitely not the ideal man that Ellie has always imagined, yet she\u0027s attracted to him in a way she can\u0027t explain. Ellie heads home to Winston Falls, South Carolina, to attend her sister\u0027s wedding. Shortly after she arrives, though, she receives a surprise visitor: Max Daniels. The Landrys have been captured, and she\u0027ll be called to testify. But they\u0027ve been captured before, and each time the witnesses are scared into silence-or disappear before they can take the stand. Max vows to be Ellie\u0027s shadow until the trial, and it isn\u0027t long before sparks fly.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:41 PM"}},{"id":88701,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9/page-34.html","bookId":1828,"book":{"id":1828,"title":"The Ideal Man (Buchanan-Renard #9)","description":"Storyline: New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood delivers a contemporary romance that\u0027s pulse-pounding in every sense of the word.
