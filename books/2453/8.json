{"id":80358,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"PART TWO\\n\\n SEARCHING\\n\\n FOR BRENDA, AND FOR HIMSELF\\n\\n Despite his several duty stops, still Harry beat Trevor Jordan back to E-Branch H. Q. He found the place just as the telepath had advised: My activated under Darcy Clarke and ready at a moment\u0027s notice to back him to the hilt ... psychically if not physically. In the event, and with the assistance of new-found friends, he hadn\u0027t needed extra help; also, and right from the beginning, he had asked Darcy to keep out of it. Be that as it may, the Head of Branch had been ready, wiling and able, and it said a lot for the value the espers placed on Harry.\\n\\n Eventually the Necroscope was able to complete his report, and in the wee smal hours he sat alone with Darcy in the latter\u0027s office. With his duties behind him, Harry at last found time to inquire after Brenda and his infant son. Not that his concern was any less than it should be, or his attitude in any way casual, but he knew that wherever his wife and child were, it was unlikely that they would come to any harm. For al that Harry Jr was a babe in arms, he\u0027d already displayed his ability to protect his mother from even the most dire threat, and Harry Sr knew that whatever mundane things the infant wasn\u0027t capable of doing for himself, Brenda - or the Great Majority - would do for him.\\n\\n And in answer to his, \u0027Anything ...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Darcy shook his head worriedly. \u0027Not a thing. Every man who wasn\u0027t on your case has been on the lookout for Brenda and the baby. They\u0027ve al drawn blanks. Precogs, telepaths, hunchmen, locators: a dead end - if you\u0027ll forgive that expression.\\n\\n When Brenda first came here, it was Harry Jr who brought her; we have to assume he\u0027s taken her away again. Why, and where to ... is anybody\u0027s guess. Of course we shall go on searching for them, but right now ... \" His shoulders slumped a little. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Harry. You\u0027ve done so much, given so much of your time and energy for us, and we don\u0027t seem able to do a thing for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which means I\u0027ll have to do it for myself,\u0027 Harry answered, but without bitterness. \u0027Darcy, you must have known from square one that the main reason I let you talk me into staying here was for Brenda? You had al the contacts, and I hoped the people you brought in would be able to do something for her. I knew she\u0027d be safe here if there were any aftershocks from the work I\u0027d been doing. But that\u0027s all over now.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy saw what was coming. \u0027You\u0027re moving out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lock, stock and barrel. E-Branch isn\u0027t for me, Darcy. I was always a loner, and that\u0027s the way I have to be. And after all - and as you\u0027ve often enough said yourself - do I really want to spend my life slopping out mental sewers? I just can\u0027t see myself at the beck and call of the police, their \"pet psychic\" who they can call on to solve every grubby little murder in the book! Oh, I know it wouldn\u0027t be like that, but it would be something like that, and it isn\u0027t what I\u0027m cut out for. So, it looks like it\u0027s come sooner than either one of us expected. I\u0027m moving out, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have any ties here. I mean, I\u0027m not bosom buddies with any of the people here, or anything like that. I have friends here, yes ... I hope you\u0027re all my friends. But no one I have to say goodbye to. Except maybe you. So, goodbye.\u0027\\n\\n Plainly Darcy didn\u0027t know what to say. \u0027You\u0027re our greatest asset - or you were.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m just a man,\u0027 Harry answered, and meant it. \u0027And anyway, the Branch has enough going for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But... lock, stock and barrel?\u0027\\n\\n Harry shrugged. That doesn\u0027t amount to much. Nothing, in fact. What\u0027s in that wardrobe in my room can stay for now. Maybe I\u0027ll pick it up sometime.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s not what I meant. No contact?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only if you find my wife and child. But in any case, I\u0027ll probably find them first.\u0027 Suppressing a yawn but stretching a little, the Necroscope grimaced as he felt a scab break on his thigh under new bandages. His expression was wry as he looked at his hands, which were also bandaged.\\n\\n \u0027You should have had stitches,\u0027 Darcy was concerned.\\n\\n \u0027I hate stitches!\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027Not to mention scars! This way if I\u0027m lucky there\u0027ll be no scars.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So where will you go? And when? Not tonight, surely?\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s my flat in Hartlepool, which could use some tidying up before I sell. It\u0027s been empty for well over a year. And my inheritance up in Bonnyrig, that big old house. I think I\u0027d probably like the solitude, and I would be that much closer to my Ma. As for when: what\u0027s wrong with tonight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 Darcy said, suddenly anxious, \u0027we\u0027re both tired. You especially. You look all in! And we don\u0027t see things right - nobody does - when we\u0027re, tired. Spend the night here; have breakfast with me in the morning; make up your mind then.\u0027\\n\\n Harry shrugged again. \u0027It\u0027s made up,\u0027 he answered. \u0027On the other hand, you\u0027re right and I am tired. Okay, tomorrow is soon enough ... \"\\n\\n Darcy looked pleased, said, \u0027And you\u0027ll stay in touch - I mean, when you\u0027re settled?\u0027\\n\\n Harry sighed. \u0027If you promise not to bother me ... maybe. But let\u0027s have it understood right here and now - I\u0027m through with E-Branch, Darcy. It isn\u0027t me. I wouldn\u0027t have time for the Branch anyway, no time for anything, until I know about Brenda and little Harry.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy nodded. \u0027Very well...\u0027 And then, on an afterthought: \u0027What will I tell the police?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n They found two bodies in that burned-out van. One was our werewolf, yes, but the other . . .? They\u0027re bound to identify him, you know. And then there\u0027s the one inside the garage, shot dead ... but with a crossbow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s deal with George Jakes first,\u0027 Harry answered. The big question is going to be: how did George get out of a Fulham mortuary into a burned out van in the East End, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re the last one who saw him, er, in designated situ, as it were. If we have to put a name on all of this - I mean, we won\u0027t, but if we had to - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would be mine, yes ... \" Harry gave it a few seconds of thought, and said, Tell them that A.C. Jamieson was an obeah man from Haiti. They should be able to prove that easily enough. He must have stolen Jakes\u0027s body so that he could use it to put some kind of hex on the police. As for why he chose to commit suicide: who knows? He was a madman, after all. Also, tell them to look for a shrivelled or melted wolf-mask, and a claw glove. Then they\u0027ll have all they need.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027More than they need,\u0027 Darcy agreed. That garage was full of class motors, most of them knocked off!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As for the one inside the garage, \"Skippy\" ... maybe that was Jamieson\u0027s work, too. Sure he was a madman, but mad like a fox!\\n\\n Killing Skippy, he was covering his tracks. Simple ... \"\\n\\n \u0027And the murder weapon?\u0027\\n\\n They won\u0027t find it,\u0027 Harry shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027Something you haven\u0027t told me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something I might look into, eventually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, then,\u0027 said Darcy, nodding thoughtfully, \u0027it seems we\u0027ve covered just about everything.\u0027 Then the faint half-smile that had almost made it onto his face turned to a frown. \u0027Still, I\u0027m glad Jakes didn\u0027t leave anyone behind.\\n\\n Family, I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know what you mean,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027It would be hard to explain, right? But don\u0027t go worrying about Jakes, Darcy. I have it on pretty good authority that he doesn\u0027t feel sorry for himself, just glad that he got his man, albeit after the fact.\u0027\\n\\n Thinking about it, Darcy\u0027s face went pale. He remembered the Bodescu case, Hartlepool on the north-east coast, and the teeming dead coming up out of their graves. But for the fact that he - what, liked the Necroscope? trusted him? knew there was no menace in him? - he supposed by now his guardian-angel talent would be howling for him to run the fuck away from the man!\\n\\n \u0027It just doesn\u0027t bear thinking about,\u0027 he said, quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Well, if you must,\u0027 the Necroscope told him, \u0027then think of it this way: Jakes was only doing what he\u0027d always done in life, and what he did best. He considers himself fortunate to have had another crack at it, and to have done it well. I say we should all be so lucky ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All I know,\u0027 Darcy answered, \u0027is that when I\u0027m dead and gone, all I will want to do is lie very still!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but that\u0027s for now,\u0027 Harry told him without emphasis, but with a strange light in those eyes that knew so much.\\n\\n Darcy was scarcely listening to or looking at him, which was probably as well, but was still considering recent events. The dead thief and murderer in the garage, for instance. Harry was right: so far the police hadn\u0027t found the murder weapon - but they did have the actual instrument of death, the short, hardwood bolt. They had spoken to him about that, and it was worth mentioning at least.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure you don\u0027t want to say anything else, Harry?\u0027 he said. \u0027About this crossbow thing, maybe? I mean, a crossbow is in any case an odd sort of weapon. But forensic are looking at it and they\u0027re puzzled by the fluke, the arrowhead.\u0027\\n\\n This was something new. Harry cocked an eyebrow. \u0027So what about it?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shrugged. \u0027It\u0027s a steel arrowhead, as you\u0027d expect. But silver-plated? You kill werewolves with silver, don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n Harry was good at hiding his thoughts, his emotions, and this time his surprise. And coming to him as an extra surprise, it seemed he was getting good at telling lies, or half-truths, too! Never to the dead . . . but to the living? \u0027I didn\u0027t know what I was going up against,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, sure, we had decided that this was the work of a ... what, a lycanthrope? Some kind of lunatic? But what if we were wrong? There are strange things in the world, as we know only too well.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy nodded. \u0027You did kill him, then? Hence the missing weapon?\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope looked away, finally muttered, \u0027He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 But now it was definitely something he would have to look into ... eventually.\\n\\n He stood up a little unsteadily, and said, \u0027I seem to be more tired than I thought - yet how am I supposed to sleep? I have a lot on my mind, going round and round. Sometimes I can\u0027t remember a time when I didn\u0027t have! A pity we can\u0027t just switch ourselves off, like machines.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy gave a smal start, as if he\u0027d just remembered something, and said, \u0027But we can! What, do you think that as head of this bloody outfit I leave sleep to chance? God, I\u0027d never get any!\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked at Darcy as he opened a desk drawer, took out a smal botle, stood up and went to a water dispenser. \u0027Do you have any alergies?\u0027 He dropped a single white pill in a glass and filed it with water. The tablet dissolved in a moment.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Harry shook his head. \u0027No alergies that I know of. But... sleeping pills?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just one,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027Does the trick for me every time. Just switches me off.\u0027\\n\\n Harry took the glass. \u0027Maybe this once,\u0027 he said, tilting his head back and downing the water. But as he drank, he didn\u0027t notice the fact that the Head of E-Branch seemed to be holding his breath ...\\n\\n After the Necroscope left to go to his own room, Darcy caled a Branch \u0027specialist\u0027 on his home number. Not an esper as such, still this was a man with an extraordinary talent. \u0027Doctor Anderson?\u0027 Darcy inquired, when finaly the \u0027phone was picked up. \u0027James Anderson? This is Darcy Clarke ... \"\\n\\n And in a moment, answering the tinny, tired voice at the other end of the line: \u0027Yes, I do know what time it is, Anderson, and I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s so late. But this is important. Do you remember that Keogh thing we spoke about? Wel, it\u0027s come up.\u0027\\n\\n And in another moment: \u0027Just two minutes ago, yes.\u0027\\n\\n And finaly, before puting the \u0027phone down: \u0027Good, I\u0027ll be expecting you.\u0027\\n\\n After that there was nothing for Darcy to do but wait for Anderson to get there. That and to suffer feelings of disgust, self-loathing, like his substance had devolved to so much quaking, treacherous scum on the surface of a sucking swamp. On the other hand ... wel, duty and conscience didn\u0027t mix, not in his job.\\n\\n Darcy\u0027s first duty was to the Branch (the swamp?), and he knew it. His conscience would have to take a back seat...\\n\\n Maybe the Necroscope\u0027s atitude had been too casual after al, or he had been too sure of himself. So E-Branch couldn\u0027t discover the whereabouts of his wife and child ... so what? They didn\u0027t have the Mobius Continuum to work with. (Like a little kid refusing to let the other kids play with his bal - Nyahh! Nyahh!\\n\\n Nyahh! Or too possessive and much too pleased with himself that he had a bal in the first place). But as the saying goes, what goes around comes around, and just like the little kid Harry had discovered that you can\u0027t play the game on your own. Especialy not hide-and-seek.\\n\\n From his rambling old house outside Bonnyrig, he called Darcy Clarke and poured out his frustrations; but Darcy could only tell him what he already knew, (else E-Branch would have contacted him first): \u0027We haven\u0027t even the foggiest idea where they could be, Harry. It\u0027s like they\u0027ve vanished off the face of the Earth!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A month, five weeks?\u0027 Harry looked at the telephone like he didn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. \u0027You\u0027ve been on it for five weeks, and nothing? What, E-Branch, with your locators and your hunchmen, your seers and scryers and precogs? You haven\u0027t the foggiest idea?\u0027\\n\\n Which got Darcy\u0027s back up more than a little. \u0027What are you trying to say, Harry?\u0027 he snapped. \u0027That you don\u0027t think we\u0027re trying hard enough? That you don\u0027t believe we\u0027re looking for them, is that it? Well, start getting it together and believe this: that we have as much interest in the kid as you have - if not for the same reasons!\u0027\\n\\n And while Harry didn\u0027t much like that last, still he knew it must be true. Of course E-Branch wanted to find Harry Jr.\\n\\n Just because his father had turned them down, that didn\u0027t mean the child would - when it was his turn! But maybe Darcy realized he\u0027d said too much, and:\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 his tone of voice was more even now, \u0027I ... don\u0027t want to fight with you. I mean, Christ, we shouldn\u0027t be fighting! We are looking for them, you know we are. And I was wrong to fly off the handle like that. What I said ...\\n\\n wasn\u0027t what I meant to say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you did say it,\u0027 Harry answered, and he was quieter, too. \u0027My son: the next E-Branch dupe! What, when he\u0027s fifteen, sixteen? And while you\u0027re waiting, you\u0027l be stood off in the background watching him grow up, measuring his skills, letting him develop? Or will you step in before then, recruit him like I was recruited: by showing him all the world\u0027s evil, and telling him that with him on the team E-Branch will have the power to change al that? And what then, Darcy? Wil he be the one who ends up slopping out al of those mental sewers? Oh realy? Not if I can help it...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And not if / can help it, Harry!\u0027 Darcy\u0027s voice was pleading now. \u0027Look, you\u0027re not yourself or you wouldn\u0027t be talking like this. And I really didn\u0027t mean it the way it sounded. You want my word on it? You\u0027ve got it: we\u0027ll never interfere with your son or his way of life. But Harry, the fact is that none of us will ever have anything to do with him, if we can\u0027t find him! and at the moment we can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope was silent for a while, then said, \u0027But you will keep trying?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course we will.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, thanks for that, at least.\u0027 And Harry put the \u0027phone down ...\\n\\n Down by the river bank, where the water swirled and eddied in a small bight, Harry spoke to his Ma. It was the first time since the day he\u0027d come up here almost three weeks ago, after selling off his flat in\\n\\n Hartlepool, and the Necroscope\u0027s mother was beginning to feel neglected. But his mind had been troubled - oh, for a long time - and like any mother she\u0027d sensed it. So despite that she could speak to him anywhere, any time, she hadn\u0027t intruded. And anyway, she knew how he liked to visit the people he talked to.\\n\\n It was the middle of April, blustery but at least dry, and Harry was wearing his overcoat where he sat at the river\u0027s rim. But you II probably catch your death anyway! she told him, feeling the cold breeze in his hair, and scanning the blurred grey mirror images of clouds scudding in the river (as seen through his eyes, of course). It\u0027s no day to be out, Harry.\\n\\n She was down there in the mud and the weeds, her spirit at least, and probably her bones, too, even if the rest of her was long washed away. But typical of a Ma (of any mother anywhere), even though Mary Keogh no longer felt the cold for herself, she was still able to feel it for her son.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 Harry told her.\\n\\n No, you\u0027re not. But she wasn\u0027t ready to push it, not yet at least. And because he didn\u0027t seem ready to speak: Well, how are things with the world, Harry? The rest of the world, I mean ...\\n\\n He recognized the ploy: to take his mind off his own problems by getting him to relate the troubles of the world in general. Now that the dead were all linked up and talking to each other from their graves and various resting places, they could get the news from recent arrivals, of course. But through the medium of the Necroscope it was that much more immediate; they could see it and perhaps even feel something of it, if not actually experience it. Harry was their one link with the living. And on this occasion especially he went along with it. For his Ma was right and-he wasn\u0027t \u0027okay\u0027.\\n\\n Not that there was much of good news. \u0027Do you really want to know?\u0027\\n\\n Is it that bad?\\n\\n \u0027Well, it isn\u0027t wonderful!\u0027 He pulled a face. \u0027You\u0027ll have to judge for yourself.\u0027 And recalling a recent newscast:\\n\\n \u0027Most of Africa is in turmoil: Zambia and Rhodesia, Mogadishu, Somalia, Ethiopia. White \"supremacy\" looks to be on its way out in Rhodesia, where they\u0027ve just voted for black rule.\u0027\\n\\n But isn\u0027t that just right? Aren\u0027t all men born equal?\\n\\n Again his shrug. \u0027As long as the recently equal are happy to remain equal -1 mean as long as they don\u0027t want to be more equal - I suppose it\u0027s okay . . .\u0027 And quickly, so as to radically change the subject before she could start protesting or moralizing: \u0027And there\u0027s been an atomic meltdown at a place called Three Mile Island in the United States.\\n\\n It\u0027s a power station.\u0027\\n\\n Oh? (She scarcely sounded impressed). Something melted? Is it that important?\\n\\n Harry had to grin. When his Ma had died nuclear power was fairly new, industrially at least. \u0027It\u0027s pretty important, yes. Dangerous stuff. It kils people, Ma. An unpleasant, invisible, silent death.\u0027 The grin was gone now from his face, and his Ma knew why. She had gathered the rest of it - the seething horror of it - from his mind. And he felt her incorporeal shudder.\\n\\n What else? she said.\\n\\n \u0027Wel, there\u0027s been some prety terrible stuff coming out of Cambodia, but - \u0027\\n\\n - But Harry couldn\u0027t possibly talk about that, not to his Ma! He at once bit his tongue and blanked his mind, wondering where in hel his thoughts could have been wandering that he\u0027d ever mentioned it. Maybe it was because of the way she, his Ma, had died, but reading about that death-lake in Stung Treng had given the Necroscope nightmares: those two thousand bodies tied together with ropes and weighted with stones ...\\n\\n She had caught on from his first mention of Cambodia, however, and quietly said, \u0027Oh, don\u0027t worry, Harry. For we know all about that. And as for Pol Pot: well, he\u0027ll have to come to us, too, you know, in the end. But he can have no idea what\u0027s waiting for him down here.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s waiting for him?\u0027 Harry had never thought of the dead as being especially vengeful. After al, what could they do? - wel, without that he, Harry Keogh, the Necroscope, was their motivation?\\n\\n Do? His Ma at once answered. We\u0027ll do nothing, say nothing, have nothing at all to do, not with him. And he\u0027ll be so cold, lost, and lonely, it will be as though he has no existence, not even this kind of existence, whatsoever. And eventually he won\u0027t have. He\u0027ll simply fade away into nothing. But he wil know why ...\\n\\n For a moment Harry felt the icy chil of her words - the coldness of outer space, the blackness of inner earth - as if it had entered into his soul. But it quickly passed and she was warm again. Strange, but of al Harry\u0027s dead people she was the only one who ever \u0027felt\u0027 warm! Or maybe not so strange. She was his Ma, after al.\\n\\n \u0027So, that\u0027s it then,\u0027 he said after a while, and shrugged. \u0027Oh, there\u0027s other stuff, but maybe it wasn\u0027t such a good idea to tel you what was happening in the world after al. I mean, when you think about it, that meltdown at Three Mile Island is probably the least of our worries!\u0027\\n\\n And she was glad to change the subject, too. But if this ... \u0027meltdown?\u0027 is so dangerous, then why did they do it?\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 (Was her understanding that limited?) \u0027But it was an accident, Ma! They didn\u0027t do it on purpose!\u0027\\n\\n Oh! (She gave a litle laugh). Then I suppose it can\u0027t be helped, can it? But her laughter quickly died away, and it was time to be serious again.\\n\\n So in fact nothing is very much different from what it always was: men go on making mistakes. And I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s much help for that.\\n\\n But now you\u0027ve got to tell me what can be helped, Harry. Tell me how I can help. And more especially, how I can help you ...\\n\\n So finaly the Necroscope\u0027s beloved mother, his frequently omniscient Ma (where he was concerned, anyway), had got to the point. She sensed it when his shoulders slumped a litle, just before he sighed and told her: \u0027I haven\u0027t found them yet, Ma - Brenda and my baby son. Oh, there are a milion places I\u0027ve not even thought to look yet, I know, but that seems a milion too many to even know where to start!\u0027\\n\\n For a while she was silent, then quietly said, Do you want me to ask among the dead, Harry? I mean, do you think it\u0027s possible that...?\\n\\n Harry scarcely dared question her on the subject, but knew he must. \u0027Surely not, Ma?\u0027 he said, almost pleadingly. \u0027If that was the case, wouldn\u0027t you have known by now? If they were ...?\u0027\\n\\n Not necessarily, son, she said. It depends where, and when. I mean, if it were you we\u0027d know, be sure! And no matter where or when, for there\u0027s only one Necroscope ... well, two now. And we\u0027d know it at once, if your light went out. But death is generally a common affair: someone is born, lives, and dies. Inevitably. Brenda is Brenda, just another ordinary person, another life. And if she were to die in some far place, well that could take some little time to get back to me.\\n\\n \u0027And your grandson, Harry Jr? Is he just another \"ordinary\" person? I don\u0027t think so - and not just because he\u0027s your grandson. He knows about you! You know about him! Wouldn\u0027t the Great Majority know it if his light was extinguished, too?\u0027\\n\\n But you have been with us for some time, Harry, she reminded him. And the Great Majority didn\u0027t know about you, either, at first. Why, they didn\u0027t even know about each other until you came on the scene! Oh, I knew you were different, but then I was your mother! But believe me, it took quite a while to convince the rest. Finally, they believed; how could it be otherwise? They felt your warmth as you passed close by; they heard your dreaming, and sensed you trembling when you were afraid. In those days of your childhood, they sprang to champion you. Little did they know that one day you would be the champion of the dead!\\n\\n \u0027You mean, they don\u0027t know him yet? He hasn\u0027t been around long enough? But in Hartlepool that time - what, a year and half ago? - they even came up out of their graves for him!\u0027\\n\\n For both of you, Harry. Oh, Harry Jr caled them up, but who did they come to save?\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t he ... warm, then? Like me?\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027s warm, yes. And the dead feel him like a small, kindly flame. But he isn\u0027t the light in their darkness, like you. One day, maybe, but not yet.\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t know it, then, if he dies . . .\u0027 It wasn\u0027t a question but a statement. And in a way Harry was glad. He wouldn\u0027t want to be appraised of his son\u0027s death, nor of Brenda\u0027s, ever. Neither by the living nor the dead.\\n\\n I would know it... sooner or later, his mother told him. But right now, I can promise you this much at least: nothing of that nature has reached me yet. To my knowledge, they are still among the living.\\n\\n Harry breathed a sigh of relief. If his mother said it was so, then it was so. And in al truth, that had only been a very smal fear anyway; he had \u0027known\u0027, been sure, that his wife and son were alive somewhere. But where?\\n\\n His Ma heard his silent query, and asked him: Where would you go, Harry, if you wanted to hide yourself away? Where would Brenda go?\\n\\n Surely you knew something of her secrets, her fantasies, her dreams?\\n\\n Suddenly the Necroscope realized how selfish he must seem. Because he hadn\u0027t been thinking of it from his wife\u0027s point of view, not really, but his own. And now his mother, in her way, had brought it home to him that Brenda was a person in her own right, with her own secrets, fantasies, dreams. With feelings and emotions and passions, al of them damaged now, or contaminated by contact with Harry\u0027s world, until she had only wanted to \u0027hide herself away\u0027 from it. But:\\n\\n That\u0027s not what I meant, son, his Ma told him. You know it isn\u0027t! It was simply my ... my manner of expression.\\n\\n Except Harry knew that speaking to the dead often conveys more than is actually said; so maybe he\u0027d read something of his Ma\u0027s true thoughts, after al. And certainly she had touched a raw nerve in him. Perhaps deliberately? Ah, but she had a way of bringing things into perspective, his mother - and ways of bringing him into line!\\n\\n But at the same time her approach to his problem had set the Necroscope thinking. For of course Brenda was different, a person in her own right with her own ways of thinking, her own likes and dislikes. So that now Harry wondered where would she be likely to hide herself away, if \u0027hiding\u0027 as such had seemed the only course open to her? She had never been much of a one for the sun but always enjoyed the rain!\\n\\n She\u0027d loved gardens, the wind in her hair, dramatic, misted landscapes. To sit in a window-seat in their garret flat and listen to the rain on the tiles ... that had been one of her favourite things.\\n\\n In which case, Harry\u0027s Ma chimed in, this place would seem entirely suited to her purpose! This very place!\\n\\n \u0027She never even saw this place,\u0027 he shook his head.\\n\\n But a place like this one?\\n\\n \u0027Maybe, maybe not. Certain coastlines seemed to appeal to her, rugged cliffs and rainy skies ... and any garden; but more especially, a garden with a coiner run wild. Long grasses, wild flowers, and a place where she could lie on her back and watch the clouds. And the stars: the brighter the better. She didn\u0027t know a single constellation, but she liked them anyway. A place of wildness - a wilderness - and a lot of stars in the clear night sky: that would suit her perfectly.\u0027\\n\\n You\u0027re a poet and you don\u0027t know it! His Ma rhymed.\\n\\n \u0027I wonder where I get it? Harry said. And she sensed that his mood was lifting a litle.\\n\\n I think it\u0027s about time you started checking on those million places, she told him. For after all, we must have narrowed them down a little by now. And Harry agreed.\\n\\n They little thought or could ever have guessed that Brenda and Harry Jr were in just such a place as the Necroscope\u0027s Ma had suggested, which her query had brought into vivid definition in his mind. A place of dramatic scenery, however alien; of long, misted nights, slanting, sunlit days, long grasses and wild flowers.\\n\\n And a garden quite beyond Brenda\u0027s previous expectations, her mundane imagination.\\n\\n For the fact was that at this point of time it was beyond even the Necroscope\u0027s imagination, too, and would stay that way long after he\u0027d given up any real hope of finding them ...\\n\\n But for now: first Harry reconsidered the places he\u0027d already checked out, starting with Brenda\u0027s old home with her folks in Harden, a coliery vilage on the north-east coast.\\n\\n The mine (\u0027the pit\u0027) itself had been worked out and shut down for some time now, so that the place had seemed even more souless than before, but the people were there as always. Of course, if Brenda or the baby were realy trying to avoid him, if they were actualy hiding themselves away from him - which he was forced to believe was true - then this would be the last place they\u0027d go. Harry had known that from the start, but still he had looked. What he\u0027d found had made him more miserable yet.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t simply approach Brenda\u0027s people as in the old days, for he was no longer him. What, go to them and tell them he was Harry Keogh, and try to explain? They\u0027d never accept any of that, these salt-of-the-earth - and very much down to earth - north-east folks! Instead he\u0027d approached Brenda\u0027s father in his local pub, introducing himself as a friend of Harry\u0027s, and asking what had become of him. Which had had a mixed result.\\n\\n To make a long story short: Brenda and Harry had got married, and there was a child. Eighteen months ago, she\u0027d taken the baby to London to join her husband.\\n\\n He was working there, writing a book or something. She was always very quiet about his work. Nothing strange about that; she was probably a bit ashamed that he didn\u0027t have a \u0027proper job.\u0027 What, Harry Keogh? Why, he hadn\u0027t done a stroke since leaving school - not physical work, anyway. But whatever he did, writing or whatever, he must be doing al right; she\u0027d never been short of money.\\n\\n But then, just a few weeks ago, she\u0027d writen to say that she was taking the baby \u0027abroad\u0027 somewhere. And that was maybe a funny thing, for she hadn\u0027t mentioned her husband: just herself and the baby. Still, she\u0027d hinted often enough that Harry did some kind of hush-hush job with the government; maybe that was it. They must have gone off somewhere overseas to some embassy or other. Maybe the writing hadn\u0027t worked out, so he was wearing his other hat now. Maybe the government had given him a job as one of these \u0027special couriers\u0027 or something: someone who carries important documents or goods from country to country. Or perhaps the writing had worked out after all, and all of this was a tax dodge. Except... well, Brenda should write more often. That last letter had been - what? All of five or six weeks ago?\\n\\n And they were her parents, after all...\\n\\n In short, they were obviously worried about her, no less in their way than Harry himself. And equally obvious, it wasn\u0027t a put-up job ... Brenda wasn\u0027t with them and they really didn\u0027t know her whereabouts. He got the same story from all of her old friends. So Harden was out; she simply wasn\u0027t there, and no one knew where she was.\\n\\n Then another thought had occurred, and one that really was worrying. The Necroscope had given the Russian E-Branch (known to Darcy Clarke and his lot as \u0027the Opposition\u0027) a hard time of it in the last two and a half years. They\u0027d lost three Heads of Branch over that same period, and seen their HQ outside Moscow reduced to so much rubble! What if this thing with his wife and baby was something they had been engineering ever since Harry\u0027s showdown with Boris Dragosani? What if they knew that he, Harry Keogh, was alive, despite that his body - his original body - was dead? If anyone was likely to have that information, it had to be the world\u0027s ESPionage organizations! The Opposition\u0027s top telepath, Zek Foener, had known it definitely ... and following the destruction of the Chateau Bronnitsy, Harry had let her go free. Could Zek have told them? And had they then taken Brenda and the baby in order to facilitate the coercion of the Necroscope himself?\\n\\n But no, a large part of that didn\u0027t make sense; he\u0027d been incorporeal following his fight with Dragosani, and no one in the world would have believed that he\u0027d ever be back, not even Harry himself! But on the other hand part of it did make sense. Right at the end of it, up in the Khorvaty region of the eastern Carpathians, Zek Foener had known that he was back. So she could have given him away after all; which would mean that her Russian superiors had put this thing together all in the space of... what, eighteen months? Even after he\u0027d decimated their E-Branch?\\n\\n No way; he hadn\u0027t left the Soviets nearly enough machinery to bring it into being! Which meant it had to be another dead end, and in a way the Necroscope was glad. He would hate to have to blame this on Zek Foener; partly because he had genuinely liked her, but mainly because his last words to her had been a warning never to come up against him or his again. If a threat carries no weight, then it isn\u0027t a threat; But this way he wouldn\u0027t have to enforce it...\\n\\n So ... where had Brenda ever been, that she might want to return to? Nowhere to mention. Where had she ever expressed a yearning to go? Again, nowhere. Since their early teens she\u0027d only ever wanted to be with Harry. And he hadn\u0027t been the most responsive of sweethearts,\\n\\n either. Indeed, he\u0027d asked himself a hundred times if he really loved her or if she was just some kind of habit. She had never known his uncertainty (he hadn\u0027t been able to tell her, because she herself had been so absolutely sure), but now he despised himself for it anyway.\\n\\n But on the other hand, how do you tell someone who has loved you for so long - as long as you can remember - that you just aren\u0027t sure of your own feelings\u0027? Not so easy. And a lot harder when she\u0027s pregnant with your child.\\n\\n Misted landscapes, dramatic scenery, cliff paths and gardens grown wild, and starry skies ...\\n\\n It brought a certain picture to mind, but of what? High passes and mountain peaks, and stars like chips of ice glinting on high.\\n\\n And a plain of boulders stretching away to a far northern horizon under the weave of ghostly auroras.\\n\\n The picture came and went like ... like an invention of his own imagination? It had to be, for he had certainly never visited such a place! But in any case it was already fading, melting into unreality like a fantastic dreamscape; which was probably as good an explanation as any: that in trying to visualize Brenda\u0027s ideal habitat, he\u0027d evoked a leftover from some old dream. Not so old, in fact... indeed so new that the actual fact of it - its basis in reality - was yet to happen. But the Necroscope couldn\u0027t know that, and in the space of just a second or so the picture had faded entirely.\\n\\n The future was ever a jealous place ...\\n\\n A million places? Hell no, there were a million million places! Since Brenda had never been anywhere or done anything very much, she could literally be anywhere doing anything! But the north-east coast was where she\u0027d been born and grown up, and it still had to be the best bet.\\n\\n Harry had tried all the towns and villages between Harden and Hartlepool, and had then backtracked all the way to Sunderland and Durham City ... to no avail. But he had been surprised how many small villages there were that he\u0027d never heard of or visited before, and how easy it was to try to find a lost someone, albeit hopelessly. Housing and building societies, hotels and flats and bedsits, and temporary accommodations, these were the obvious places to check: Brenda had to be living somewhere, had to have a roof over her head. She wasn\u0027t registered at any of the agencies; the dozen or so girls with small babies who were registered weren\u0027t Brenda. And Harry wasn\u0027t greatly surprised, but he\u0027d had to try anyway.\\n\\n Somewhere abroad: that letter she wrote to her father had said she was going abroad, hence the milion milion places. For if there were a couple of hundred towns in the north-east that the Necroscope had never visited, and five thousand in the rest of England, then what of the rest of the world?\\n\\n Somewhere abroad.\\n\\n ... A garden in a fertile saddle between ruggedly weathered spurs, where dusty beams of sunlight came slanting through the high passes during the long daylight hours, and the stars glittered like frosted jewels at night, or ice-shards suspended in the warp and weave of ghostly auroras ...\\n\\n The northernmost of the North American States? Canada? The frozen tundras of the northern Soviet Union?\\n\\n Switzerland? (Did they even see the aurora borealis in Switzerland - and why the northern lights anyway?) But Brenda was a British girl, naive in most things even in her native country, even in her native county! And as the Necroscope rubbished his own inward directed queries, so that fleeting picture of some far, alien land once more retreated. Which was just as well, for search as he might he would never discover it on Earth.\\n\\n Never find them ... never find his baby son ... never even see them again ... not on Earth!\\n\\n Harry started awake in a cold sweat, in his bedroom in the old house not far from Bonnyrig. A sweat of fear and frustration, yes, and a feeling of utter loneliness.\\n\\n He lay panting in his bed, damp with perspiration, feeling his heart racing and his blood pumping. So that for a few brief moments it wasn\u0027t as if Brenda and the baby were missing at all but simply that. . . that he was the lost one! And of course the genuine Harry Keogh, the original Harry, was lost.\\n\\n That again: his body, gone. And piece by piece his entire world going, too. Was that why he had to find Brenda, in order to find himself? In which case his search was useless, for she would only deny him.\\n\\n Fuck it... that was why she\u0027d run away in the first place! Because he wasn\u0027t him!\\n\\n She\u0027d run, or been taken away. By the baby or by ... someone else?\\n\\n The Russians? But he\u0027d already been over that and it seemed very unlikely. So if not the Opposition, the much-ravaged Soviet E-Branch, then who?\\n\\n As his sweat dried on him, so Harry\u0027s thoughts cleared and his mind seemed to sharpen and focus as he hadn\u0027t been able to focus it for quite some time. He went right back to square one: to that night at E-Branch HQ when he\u0027d first been told that his wife was missing. At the time he had put aside the possibility that A.C. Doyle Jamieson - self-styled \u0027werewolf - could have been responsible for the double disappearance. But now?\\n\\n The man had been into his mind, after all... but for how long? Harry had become his \u0027enemy\u0027 the moment he became involved with the dead police officers and took up their case. Had A. C. been \u0027listening\u0027 to him - to his thoughts and worries and problems - from that time on? In which case he would know about Brenda, Harry\u0027s one weakness. But surely if that were the case, ;/ he and his gang of car thieves were responsible for Brenda\u0027s disappearance, then right at the end when A.C. himself had come under fire, he would have used her as a threat, to stand Harry off. Yes, of course he would -but he hadn\u0027t. So ...\\n\\n ... So, damn it to hell, it was another blind alley!\\n\\n After speaking to his Ma he\u0027d come back to the house full of resolve, and now it was almost burned out of him again. But while his mind was sharp he must pursue the problem. It was so frustrating: to be equipped with his powers - the powers of a Necroscope - and no way to use them to solve his problem, except by trial and error.\\n\\n He got up from the bed feeling stiff; this damned body of his, which wasn\u0027t nearly as flexible as it had used to be. Because it was a different one, naturally. Or unnaturally?\\n\\n The light coming through fly-specked windows was grey as the day outside. He had been down only an hour or two. An hour or two wasted. Down and out. Wilting. Going to seed. Oh, really? And suddenly Harry was angry with himself. He had to shake himself out of it and get on with the search, get on with life. He was ten years older than he should be, sure, but he didn\u0027t have to settle for that, did he? His mind was still in shape, wasn\u0027t it? And the mind governs the body, doesn\u0027t it? Well then, he\u0027d have to get the fucking body in shape, too!\\n\\n He was dressed; he went out into his overgrown garden and did twenty furious press-ups, then felt ridiculous and sat hugging his knees in the deep grass and shivering from the difference in temperature between the house and the garden. And in a while he thought:\\n\\n My Ma\u0027s right... I\u0027ll catch my death!\\n\\n Death, yes.\\n\\n Always a close companion of Harry\u0027s, death wasn\u0027t something he worried about. Not from a distance, anyway. Close up it would be different, of course. If ever death should attempt his stealthy (or sometimes abrupt!) approach, then like anyone else Harry would be galvanized - to life! But as for the idea of death and the dead themselves, he knew no fear.\\n\\n Indeed, he had a thousand dead friends, but not one of them who could help him now, not this time. While among the living ... did he have any friends at all?\\n\\n Well, some - like Darcy Clarke and his people - but even they weren\u0027t like the dead, because the dead were true friends and rarely demanded payment. As for the exceptions to the rule, the one or two monstrous members of the Great Majority who had demanded payment ... but they were in the Necroscope\u0027s past now and couldn\u0027t resurface. At least he prayed not.\\n\\n It was a morbid train of thought, which he tried to break by numbering his friends among the living. These were a handful at best; no, not even that, for he couldn\u0027t any longer approach them as Harry Keogh. They would \u0027know\u0027 that he wasn\u0027t!\\n\\n Depression, was that it? Probably. And Harry thought: /// believed in psychiatry I might even go and see a shrink. But if he started to explore my past, how could I explain it? He\u0027d be certain / was incurably insane! Or, if I liked strong drink, I might go and get drunk and see how I felt when I woke up. Except... I wouldn\u0027t know where to go to drink, and I\u0027d probably feel out of place when I got there. But damn it, I really feel like I could use a good stif drink! And a talk with a genuine friend. Yet I have no one to talk to but the teeming dead, and they\u0027re the only ones who give a damn anyway!\\n\\n A morbid train of thought, yes ...\\n\\n But now the entire chain of his thoughts, ever since he\u0027d started awake in a cold sweat, began to join up link upon link. And there was one missing link, which was integral to the rest. He hadn\u0027t thought of it until now because it had seemed wrong, especially when he was searching, or trying to search, for his wife and child. But there might be something in it at that.\\n\\n Initials writhed on the screen of Harry\u0027s mind. Not A.C. Doyle Jamieson and his brother R.L. Stevenson\u0027s initials, but someone else\u0027s. Someone the Necroscope had studiously avoided thinking of until now. But now ... maybe he did have a friend among the living after al.\\n\\n Or someone who owed him, at least. And maybe, just maybe, it went a lot deeper than that. For one thing, the time frame was right: the disappearance of his wife and child had coincided precisely with this one\u0027s advent. And since that was true, mightn\u0027t there be a more relevant, more sinister connection?\\n\\n Psychiatry? Maybe that was the last thing Harry needed. Maybe al he needed was a rest - from al of this, even from thinking about it! Or a change. Didn\u0027t they say that a change was as good as a rest?\\n\\n Have a good stif drink and sleep it of, sleep it right out of his system. Clear the air. Christ, he needed a drink! Or was it simply his body - or somebody else\u0027s body - that needed it? But... the mind controls the body, doesn\u0027t it? Wel, yes, it does, except when the body has habits or needs that control the mind!\\n\\n Suddenly things clicked into place in the Necroscope\u0027s metaphysical, his lateral-thinking mind. But his mind in another\u0027s body. And a litle shakily - shaky with realization, albeit as yet unproven - he went back into the house, to the telephone.\\n\\n Darcy Clarke was at E-Branch, and he at once sensed something of the excitement in Harry\u0027s voice. And in answer to the Necroscope\u0027s question:\\n\\n \u0027What, Alec Kyle? What did he do when he was under pressure?\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027Well, he would just ride it out, Harry.\\n\\n When there was work to be done, or a problem to be solved, he\u0027d work at it al the way until he\u0027d covered every angle, almost to the point of exhaustion. And after that? What did he do for relaxation?\u0027 (Harry could almost sense the other\u0027s grin). \u0027Wel, I\u0027m not sure if I should mention this, you know? I mean - speaking ill of the dead and al that - but... \"\\n\\n \u0027... Did he like a drink?\u0027 Finaly Harry forced the issue. And Darcy\u0027s answer lit up his mind like the crack of dawn on a summer day:\\n\\n \u0027Did Alec like a drink? Did he ever! When he was wound up, so tight it was the only way to unwind ... then he would drink, yes! Usualy at home, because there he wasn\u0027t risking anything and he didn\u0027t have so far to fal into bed. I remember one time he invited me round to his place and between us we kiled a big botle of Jack Daniel\u0027s. I stayed over, because I knew I wasn\u0027t going to make it to anywhere else. And I paid for it for three whole days. But Alec was just fine! That body of his could soak up hard liquor like a sponge.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He wasn\u0027t an alcoholic, was he?\u0027 (Something of alarm now, in the Necroscope\u0027s voice).\\n\\n \u0027God, no! Once in a blue moon, that\u0027s al. But when he did it, Alec did it right.\u0027\\n\\n Thanks,\u0027 Harry breathed, and put the \u0027phone down.\\n\\n And now he knew. Knew how to be himself again: by not being himself. Feelings of illicit atraction? Chemistry, that\u0027s al. Alec Kyle\u0027s chemistry. And the need to have a good stiff drink folowing a period of prolonged stress? Again, chemistry: the ex-precog\u0027s body doing its own thing - or rather the thing it had used to do.\\n\\n And there stood Harry smack dab in the middle, firm in his determination to get used to his new body, without giving a moment\u0027s thought to the fact that it must get used to him!\\n\\n So maybe a night on the town wasn\u0027t such a bad idea after al. Maybe then he\u0027d be able to get it al going - get body and mind working together - and figure something out. And come to think of it, he did know where to go to get a drink, and probably a free one at that. She owed him that much at least.\\n\\n Alec Kyle\u0027s personal body chemistry? Illicit atraction? Sheer loneliness? Maybe it was al of these things. And initials, certainly.\\n\\n B.J.\u0027s ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-8.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \\n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
