{"id":80352,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"The powerful, silver-grey stretch limo, familiar in itself however unusual - but less than unique - on an island of ancient Fiats and sputtering Lambrettas, bumped carefully over shifting cobbles under a baroque stone archway into the courtyard of Julio\u0027s Cafe and Restaurant in the eastern quarter of Palermo. The lone survivor of a World War II bombing raid, the walled enclosure was once the smallest of four gardens containing a middling villa. The other three gardens were rubble-strewn craters; only their outer walls had been repaired, to create something of an acceptable fagade in the district of the Via Delia Magione.\n The courtyard was set out like a fan-shaped checker-board: square tables decked with white covers, standing on black flags of volcanic stone; the whole split down the middle by a \u0027hinge\u0027 of vehicles parked herringbone-fashion on what was once a broad carriageway. A palm-fringed gap in the wall at the point of the quadrant marked the vehicular exit into the dusky evening.\n Some three dozen patrons sat eating, drinking, chattering, though not too energetically; a pair of sweating, white-aproned waiters ran to and fro between the tables, the bar and kitchens, each serving his own triangle of customers. Even for the third week in May the weather was unseasonably warm; at eight-thirty in the evening the temperature was up in the high seventies.\n The east-facing wall of the courtyard contained what was left of the old villa: a two-storeyed wing three rooms wide and three deep, with a balcony supported by Doric columns that more than hinted of better times. The central, ground-floor room was fronted by a marble bar which spanned the gap between the pillars; kitchens to the left of the bar stood open to the inspection of patrons. Amazingly, in this bombed-out relic of a place, wide arches in the wall to the right displayed the sweep of the original grand marble staircase winding to the upper rooms and balcony. Better times indeed!\n On the balcony - whose tables were reserved for \u0027persons of quality\u0027 - Julio Sclafani himself leaned out as far as his belly would allow to observe the arrival of these latest, most elevated of all his customers: Anthony and Francesco Francezci, come down from the high Madonie especially to eat at Julio\u0027s.\n It was wonderful that they came here, these men of power, ignoring the so-called \u0027class\u0027 restaurants to dine on Julio\u0027s simple but worthy fare. And they\u0027d been doing it for six weeks now, ever since the first signs of improvement in the weather. Or ... perhaps it was that one of them, or even both of them, had noticed Julio\u0027s Julietta? For Sclafani\u0027s youngest, still unmarried daughter was a stunner after all. And the Brothers Francezci were eminently eligible men ...\n But what a shame that she wasn\u0027t at her best! It must be the pollution of Palermo\u0027s air. The fumes of all the cars and mopeds, the stagnation of all the derelict places, the breathing of dead air and the winter damp that came drifting in off the Tyrrhenian Sea. But spring was here and summer on its way; Julietta would bloom again, just as the island was blooming.\n Except... it was worrying, the way she\u0027d come down with - well, with whatever it was - just four or five weeks ago; since when all of the colour had seemed to go out of her, all the joy and vitality, everything that had made her the light of Julio\u0027s life. To be back there on her couch, all exhausted, with an old biddy of a sick-nurse sitting beside her - \u0027in attendance,\u0027 as it were - as at someone\u0027s deathbed! What, Julietta? Perish the thought! As fof the old crow: Julio supposed he should consider himself lucky to have obtained her services so reasonably. All thanks to the Francezcis, for she was one of theirs.\n But here they came even now, smiling up at him - at him! - as they mounted the marble staircase. Such elegant ... such eligible men! Julio hastened to greet them at the head of the stairs, and usher them to their table on the balcony .. .\n Almost exactly one hour earlier, Tony and Francesco Francezci had departed Le Manse Madonie in the mountain heights over Cefalu en-route for Julio\u0027s and the supposed gourmet pleasures of the cafe\u0027s \u0027cuisine.\u0027 The quality of Julio Sclafani\u0027s food was, ostensibly, the sole reason for the Francezcis\u0027 weekly visit to the crumbling, by no means decadent but decidedly decayed city. Ostensibly, yes.\n But in fact the brothers didn\u0027t much care for the food at Sclafani\u0027s, nor for the eating of common fare anywhere else for that matter. They could just as easily dine at Le Manse Madonie, and do far better than at Julio\u0027s, without the bother of having to get there. For at the Manse the brothers had their own servants, their own cooks, their own ... people.\n And so as Mario, their chauffeur, had driven the brothers down the often precipitous, dusty hairpin track from the Manse to the potholed \u0027road\u0027 that joins Petralia in the south to the spa town of Termini Imerese on the coast - where according to legend the buried Cyclops \u0027pisses in the baths of men, to warm them\u0027 - so Francesco had turned his mind and memory to the real reason for their interest in Sclafani\u0027s piddling cafe: the fat man\u0027s daughter, Julietta. Francesco\u0027s interest, anyway ...\n It had been six weeks ago to the day. The brothers had been in Palermo to attend a meeting of the Dons: the heads of the most powerful Families in the world, with the possible exception of certain branches of European Royalty and nobility, and other so called \u0027leaders of men\u0027 or business, politicians and industrialists mainly, in the United States of America and elsewhere. Except there\u0027s power, and there\u0027s power. That of the Francezcis was landed and gilt-edged ... and ancient, and evil.\n It lay in the earth (in territory, or real estate); in the wealth they\u0027d been heir to for oh-so-many, many years, plus the additional wealth which the principal and their unique talents had accumulated and augmented; and not least in those peculiar talents themselves.\n For in fact the Francezcis were advisers. Advisers to the Mafia, still the main force and power-base in Italy and Sicily; and through the Mafia advisers to the CIA, the KGB, and others of the same ilk; and through them advisers to those governments which allegedly \u0027controlled\u0027 them. And because their advice was invariably good, invariably valuable, they were revered as Dons of Dons, as every Francezci before them. But to actually speak of them in such a connection ... that would be quite unpardonable. It was understandable; their social standing ...\n As to that last: they had the reputations of the gentlest of gentlemen! Their presence had been requested - even fought over - for every major social event on the island for the last fifteen years, ever since they came into their inheritance and possession of Le Manse Madonie. And their bloodline: there had been Francezci Brothers for as long as men could remember. The family was noted for its male twins, also for a line that went back into the dimmest mists of history - and into some of the darkest. But that last was for the brothers alone to know.\n Thus the immemorial and ongoing connection of the Francezcis with certain of the island\u0027s (and indeed the world\u0027s) less savoury elements was unsuspected; or if it was it wasn\u0027t mentioned in polite circles. Yet in their role of freelance intelligence agents for the Mob or mobs - as advisers in the field of international crime, various kinds of espionage, and terrorism - the Francezcis were an unparalleled success story. Where or how they gained their intelligence in these diverse yet connected fields: that, too, was for the brothers alone to know, and for others to guess at. But to the Dons it seemed obvious that they had corrupted the incorruptible on a world-wide scale ...... Francesco\u0027s thoughts had strayed from their course. As the limo glided, or occasionally bumped, for the junction with the A-19 motorway into Palermo, he redirected his mind to that evening six short weeks ago:\n After their meeting with the Dons (whom they had advised on such problems as what or what not to do about Aldo Moro and his kidnappers the Red Brigade, in Italy, and President Leone, who had become an embarrassment) the hour had been late. Driving back through Palermo and turned aside by a diversion where road works were in progress, Tony had noticed Julio\u0027s Cafe and suggested they pause a while for refreshments.\n Indoors in the room of the marble staircase, the brothers had ordered Julio\u0027s \u0027Greek Island Specialities.\u0027 They\u0027d picked at spicy sausages, stuffed vine-leaves, and various dips prepared in olive oil - but no garlic - all washed down with tiny measures of Mavrodaphne and a chaser, the brackish Vecchia Romagna, sipped from huge brandy-bowl glasses. By nine-thirty the kitchens had closed; the brothers dined alone. Julio had excused himself - a toothache! He\u0027d called a dentist who, even at this late hour, had agreed to see him. His daughter, Julietta, would see the brothers off the premises when they were done.\n Perhaps Francesco had drunk a little too much Mavrodaphne, too large a measure of brandy. Or it could be that in the gloom and draughty emptiness of the place, with the picked-at food gone cold on their plates, and the knowledge of lowering skies just beyond the arches, the woman had looked more radiant, more luminous ... more pure? Whatever, Francesco had looked at her in a certain way, and she had looked back. And Anthony Francezci had gone down to the limo on his own, while his brother ...\n At which point the silver grey hearse of a car had swerved to avoid a dead animal in the road - a goat, Mario thought! - and again Francesco had been shaken from his reflections where he lolled in a corner of the back seat. Perhaps it was as well. They had been passing close to Bagheria; in a moment they\u0027d be making a sharp right turn. Oh, yes, for Tony would surely want to park a while at a place he was fond of: the Vila Palagonia.\n \u0027What, drawn to your monsters yet again?\u0027 Francesco\u0027s comment had been petulant, almost angry; he was irritated that his mood and memories had been broken into.\n \u0027Our monsters!\u0027 Tony had answered immediately and sharply. For it was true enough: both of the brothers knew the inspiration behind the lunatic array of stone beasts that adorned the walls of the villa. The carved dwarves and gargoyles, the creatures with human hands and feet, and other Things that defied description. Some two hundred years ago the owner of the villa, Prince Ferdinando Gravina, had insisted upon visiting Le Manse Madonie, home to the Ferenczinis, as their name was then. Rich as Croesus, he had been interested to discover why the equally wealthy Ferenczinis were satisfied to dwell in such an \u0027out-of-the-way, austere, almost inhospitable sort of place.\u0027\n And Ferdinando\u0027s mania for grotesques - or his mania in general - had later emerged as a direct result of that visit.\n But in any case Francesco had shrugged, saying, \u0027According to Swinburne, these sculptures have their origin in Diodorus\u0027s tale of the freakish creatures that came out of the Nile\u0027s sunbaked mud.\u0027 And before his brother could answer: \u0027Perhaps it\u0027s better if that legend prevails? It was a long time ago, after all. Too long ago, for such as you and I to remember!\u0027\n At which Tony had scowled and answered, \u0027Ferdinando looked into the pit, brother - the pit at Le Manse Madonie - and we both know it!\u0027 And then, sneeringly: \u0027Let\u0027s be discreet by all means, but in the privacy of our own car in a place like this, who is there to eavesdrop?\u0027\n Then, as at a signal, Mario had driven on for Palermo ...\n And now they were there, at the Cafe Julio, and the fat little sod seating them at a table on his precious balcony and detailing his odious \u0027cuisine,\u0027 from which list they ordered this and that: a few items to pick at, a carafe of red wine. All a sham, a show; the brothers moved the food about their plates, waiting for Sclafani to mention Julietta. And eventually, returning upstairs from some small duty in the kitchens:\n \u0027Gentlemen, I\u0027m eternally in your debt!\u0027 Julio bowed and scraped, plucked nervously at the towel over his arm as he sidled up to their table. \u0027Er, I mean with regard to your kindness in providing a ... a companion for my daughter. I cannot bring myself to call the old lady a nurse - can\u0027t admit to any real sickness in my girl - but the woman is a godsend nevertheless. She fetches and carries, sees to my daughter\u0027s needs, and I am left free to attend my business.\u0027\n \u0027Julietta?\u0027 Francesco contrived to look concerned. \u0027Your daughter? Is she no better, then? We\u0027d wondered why she wasn\u0027t around ...\u0027 He looked down over the balcony into the courtyard, casting here and there with his dark eyes as if searching.\n Julio turned his own eyes to the night sky and flapped his hands in an attitude of despair or supplication. \u0027Oh, my lovely girl! Weak as water and pale as a cloud! Julietta will get better, I am sure. But for now ... she reclines upon her bed, with shadows under her eyes, and complains about the sunlight creeping in her room so that she must keep the curtains drawn! Some strange lethargy, a malaise, a weird photophobia.\u0027\n The brothers looked at each other - perhaps quizzically - and Francesco finally nodded. And to Julio: \u0027Sclafani, we have business tonight. A man of ours returns from an important trip out of the country.\n Meanwhile we\u0027re out for a drive, passing a little time. It\u0027s a very pleasant evening, after all. Alas, we may be called away at any moment, which is why we didn\u0027t order more extensively from your menu. But this thing with Julietta: we find ourselves ... concerned for you.\u0027\n \u0027Indeed,\u0027 Tony nodded. \u0027We Francezcis are delicate that way ourselves - with regard to strong sunlight, I mean.\n Which is why we\u0027re not often out and about when the sun is up.\u0027\n \u0027And,\u0027 Francesco went on, thoughtfully, \u0027 - who can say - perhaps we find ourselves in a position to be of further service?\u0027 Qulio could have fainted! What, the Francezci Brothers, of service to him and his? Of further service?)\n \u0027You see,\u0027 said Tony, \u0027in three days a man will fly from Rome. A doctor, a specialist. You are right: there is a certain malaise or anaemia abroad. Servants of ours in Le Manse Madonie are laid low by it; we ourselves feel a definite lethargy. Our blood seems ... weak? But at least in the heights we have the benefit of clean air! While here in the city .. .\u0027 He shrugged.\n Open-mouthed, Julio looked from one brother to the other. \u0027But what do you propose? I mean, I scarcely dare presume - \u0027\n \u0027 - That our doctor friend should take a look at Julietta, and perhaps keep her under observation a while?\u0027 Francesco cut him short. \u0027But why not? He\u0027s our own private doctor and comes with the very highest recommendation!\n Moreover, he\u0027s been paid in advance. In such an arrangement, surely there are no losers! So, it\u0027s settled.\u0027 He nodded his head as in final confirmation.\n \u0027Settled?\u0027\n \u0027We shall send our car for Julietta three evenings from now -Saturday, yes. And the old woman shall stay with her at all times, of course. But that is to look on the gloomy side, for in the event that she should recover between now and then, which naturally we hope she will...\u0027\n \u0027I... am stunned!\u0027Julio choked out the words.\n \u0027No need to be,\u0027 said Tony, delicately dabbing at his mouth. Take our card. If your Julietta shows signs of recovery, call us. Otherwise look for our car Saturday night. After that, you may inquire after her at your convenience. But remember: we\u0027re private men. Our telephone number is restricted. And rest assured, Julietta will be attended to in every circumstance.\u0027\n It was done. Hardly believing his stroke of good fortune, the fat man went about the night\u0027s business in a daze; the brothers, apparently unmoved, continued to pick at their food . . . until Julio was observed busying himself at the tables in the courtyard below. Then: \u0027Watch the stairs,\u0027 Francesco said. \u0027If he comes up, issue a warning or distract him.\u0027 But as he stood up and moved back a pace from the balcony:\n \u0027Now who is being indiscreet?\u0027 Tony smiled up at him with eye-teeth that were white and needle-sharp in a too-wide mouth.\n Francesco leaned towards his brother - leaned at a peculiar angle -and answered through clenched teeth in a voice that was suddenly as black and bubbling as tar, \u0027What, but can\u0027t you smell that bitch back there?\u0027 In another moment he straightened up, coughed to clear his throat, and continued in a more normal tone of voice. \u0027Anyway, we need to be certain the fat fool will accept our offer. So drink your wine ... and watch the stairs!\u0027\n He turned away. Two paces took him across the balcony and through a curtained archway into a corridor. He passed a gentlemen\u0027s toilet on his left, a ladies\u0027 on the right, and entered a door marked \u0027Private\u0027 into Julio\u0027s office.\n Skirting the desk, he passed through a second door into Julietta\u0027s sick-room. And there she lay, with the old biddy Katerin, eighty years old if she was a day, in attendance. The crone was nodding. Startled, she glanced up at Francesco through rheumy eyes. \u0027Who? What?\u0027 Then, recognizing him, she smiled, nodded and made to rise.\n \u0027No, stay,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Best that you\u0027re here, in case that oily little fat man should look in.\u0027 Katerin nodded again and sat still. In the dimness of the room, the grandam\u0027s eyes were yellow as a cat\u0027s watching her master.\n He sat half-way up the wide couch where Julietta lay, and his sudden weight woke her. Or perhaps she\u0027d already been awake ... waiting. Her eyes opened big as saucers; her jaw fell open; knowledge and horror painted themselves with rapid strokes upon her lovely, oval, oddly palid face. But in no way odd to Francesco. And before she could cry out, if she would:\n \u0027Did you think I would desert you? Ah, no!\u0027 he told her. And his hand crept under her blanket, under her nightgown, to her thigh, so that she could feel his fingers trembling there. \u0027No, for having loved you once, I shall love you all the days of your life.\u0027 But he did not say \u0027my life.\u0027\n As his hand climbed higher on her thigh, so Julietta\u0027s mouth closed and her fluttering breathing steadied; she began to breathe more deeply - of his breath. His essence was in it, as it was in her. And his eyes were uniformly jet, like moist black marbles in his face and unblinking, or like the eyes of a snake before he strikes. Except he had already struck, on that night six weeks ago. And the poison had taken.\n He smiled with his handsome, devil\u0027s face, and the horror went out of her as she lifted her arms to embrace him. But that could not be. \u0027Soon,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Soon - at Le Manse Madonie! Can\u0027t you wait? A day or two, my Julietta. Just a day or two, I promise.\u0027 Her sigh, and her breathing suddenly quickening; the long lashes over her dark eyes fluttering, as Francesco\u0027s cool hand discovered the inside of her hot thigh. Then her nod, and a gasp of weird ecstasy as her head flopped to one side in sudden shame, or defeat, or surrender, and her thighs lolled open.\n He held her lips open with his thumb and smallest finger, and let the middle three elongate into her. His hand was quite still, but the three central fingers stretched with a caterpillar\u0027s expansion, throbbing with the effort of metamorphosis like a trio of sentient penises, with pouting lips opening in their tips. And into her body they crept, while his thumb and smallest finger closed on her bud, to gentle it like a nipple.\n And with the old crone watching and knowing everything - laughing silently through a gap-toothed mouth whose eye-teeth at least were still sharp and white - so Francesco found the artery he sought and used his fingers to pierce and sip at the soft centre of Julietta\u0027s sex where the marks, if he left any, would never be found, and the blood, if any continued to flow, would have its own explanation.\n Then, in a few seconds, a minute - as the girl went, \u0027Ah! Ah! Ah!\u0027 and turned her head this way and that, until her eyes rolled up - slowly Francesco\u0027s jaws cracked open in a grin or a grimace, allowing a trickle of saliva to slop from a corner of his writhing lips. In that same moment his own eyes turned to flame, and then to blood! Julietta\u0027s blood. But: Brother! It was Anthony; not a call as such (for the brothers were not gifted with the true art), but a warning definitely. A tingling of nerves, a premonition. Julio was coming!\n A moment to withdraw from Julietta, and another to lean forward and kiss her clammy brow. Then he was out of the room, flowing from Sclafani\u0027s office into the corridor, and the door marked \u0027Men\u0027 closing softly behind him. And his penis steaming as he plied it in the privacy of a cubicle, once, twice, three times, before it spurted into the bowl. And even his sperm was red where Francesco pulled the chain on it ...\n In the corridor, Sclafani was waiting for him. \u0027Ah! Forgive me! I supposed you would be in there. Your brother asked me to tell you ... Your man has returned from England ... And your driver, Mario? ... A radio message?\u0027 He fluttered his hands, as if that were explanation enough. Which in fact it was.\n Francesco was cool now. He smiled his gratitude, and made for the balcony with Julio hard on his heels. \u0027It\u0027s been such a pleasure to have you,\u0027 the fat man was babbling. \u0027I can\u0027t possibly bill you. What? But I\u0027m already too deeply in your debt!\u0027\n At the table, Mario stood by in his uniform and cap while Tony spoke into a portable radio-telephone. Francesco wheeled on Julio and almost knocked him over. \u0027My friend,\u0027 he said hurriedly. This is a private conversation. You understand? As for the bill: the pleasure was all ours.\u0027 He pressed a wad of notes into the proprietor\u0027s hand, more than enough to cover what they had not eaten. As Julio waddled off, Tony was standing up.\n \u0027ETA in forty-five minutes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even if we go right now, still the chopper will beat us to the Manse.\u0027 He shrugged. Francesco nodded and said, Til speak to Luigi en route.\u0027\n In the limo Francesco sat up front beside Mario. Outside Palermo the static cleared up and he was able to make himself understood on the car\u0027s communication system. \u0027Your patient?\u0027 \u0027Sedated,\u0027 came back a tinny, almost casual voice. Threw up a little ... doesn\u0027t seem to travel too well. The sedative, I suppose.\u0027 From the back of the limo Tony said: \u0027Well, purging can\u0027t hurt.\n They\u0027ll be seeing to that anyway, at Le Manse.\u0027 Francesco glanced back at him. \u0027I left instruction, yes.\u0027 And into the radio: \u0027Any problems at the other end?\u0027\n \u0027None. Smooth as silk. Everything should be that easy!\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 Francesco was pleased. \u0027And this end? Control?\u0027\n They\u0027ve cleared me on to Le Manse Madonie. No problem.\u0027 (Of course not. The Francezcis\u0027 man in Air Traffic Control at Catania had picked up more than a year\u0027s wages for this!) \u0027Our people at the Manse will see to your patient,\u0027 Francesco finished. \u0027We\u0027ll be along later. Oh, and well done.\u0027 Thanks, and out,\u0027 the unseen pilot answered. There were no frills, not on the air ...\n At Le Manse Madonie, the brothers looked on while their people saw to the girl from the helicopter. Still sedated, she\u0027d been stripped and bathed by the time they got there. The rest of it would take most of the night. They watched for an hour or so - the enemas, the operation of the pumps and mechanically forced voiding, the \u0027purification,\u0027 as it were - but after that they lost interest. The manicuring of nails, the cleansing and polishing of teeth, application of fast-acting fungicides to her various openings (lotions to be removed later in a final bathing), al of that would go on and on. Clinical but less than beneficial: health wasn\u0027t the object of the exercise. Only cleanliness.\n \u0027And all wasted,\u0027 Tony Francezci shook his head in disgust as they made for their apartments about midnight. They wouldn\u0027t sleep but merely rest; time for sleeping when it was over.\n \u0027Wasted?\u0027 his brother answered. \u0027Not at all. Well, the girl herself, maybe, but not the effort. He likes them clean, after all. And she can\u0027t lie to him, can\u0027t hide anything. Outside her mind, we could merely prise for clues. Inside it ... he can lay everything bare down to the electrons of her brain and patterns of her past, the memories in the mush of her grey matter.\u0027\n \u0027Poetic!\u0027 Francesco\u0027s brother seemed appreciative, but his voice almost immediately turned sour. \u0027Ah, but will he divulge what he discovers? Or will he obscure and obfuscate, as he\u0027s so wont to do? He gets more difficult all the time.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll tell us something of it, at least,\u0027 the other nodded. \u0027It\u0027s been a while and he\u0027s hungry. He\u0027ll be grateful, and she\u0027ll make a rare tidbit. Why, I could even fancy her myself!\u0027\n Tony gave a snort. \u0027What? But you could fancy old Katerin, if that\u0027s all there was!\u0027 And as they parted company at the top of a flight of stairs and made for their own rooms: \u0027Oh, and on that same note: did you have Julietta, in Julio\u0027s backroom?\u0027\n \u0027Something like that,\u0027 his brother leered back at him. \u0027If you\u0027re asking will we be sending for her . . . yes, we will. Why? Would you perhaps like her for yourself?\u0027\n \u0027Not really,\u0027 Tony told him. \u0027For you\u0027ve been there before me.\u0027 There was no malice in it, nor in Francesco\u0027s answer:\n \u0027It never stopped you before,\u0027 he said, evenly ...\n In the hour before dawn, the Francezcis met again in the secret heart of Le Manse Madonie. Beneath extensive cellars and ancient foundations, at a place deep in the bedrock - a place known only as \u0027the pit\u0027 - they came together to attend personally to the final stage of the operation: the lowering of the girl into an old, dried-out well.\n The mouth of the well was maybe fourteen feet across, wall to wall; the walls were three feet high, and of massive blocks of old hewn masonry; a \u0027lid\u0027 of electrified wire-mesh in a circular frame was hinged to the walls on opposite sides, covering the opening like a grille. But the pit was silent for now, sullen and sinister even to the Francescis. Down there somewhere, at a depth of some eighty feet, it opened into a cyst that had once contained water. Now it housed their father.\n A mechanical hoist stood to one side, its gantry reaching out over the pit. Suspended by chains, a metal table slowly rotated.\n The girl lay naked on the table, with her hands folded on her stomach. In her entire life she had only once been cleaner, less toxic: in the womb, in the days preceding her birth before the first human hands were lain on her. Now mhuman hands would be lain on her.\n But first the interrogation; not of the girl but the Old Ferenczy, the monstrously mutated Francezci in his pit. Only the brothers were present; it wasn\u0027t work for lesser, more easily influenced or corrupted minds. But then, how might one corrupt the Francezcis?\n The cavern containing the pit was a natural place, made unnatural only by its grotesque inhabitant. Rocky ledges swept back into darkness, but the pit itself was illuminated: a bank of powerful spotlights shone down on it from the nitre-streaked dripstone walls. Where the shadows crept, stone steps had been cut back into a shaft that climbed in a spiral to the Manse - the aerie - high overhead. At the foot of the steps an electrified pneumatic \u0027door,\u0027 a grille of two-inch steel bars, guarded the exit. The door\u0027s control panel was set well back within the brightly lit shaft. Like the cover over the old well, this door to the exit shaft wasn\u0027t designed to keep anyone or thing out.\n Yet the place wasn\u0027t specifically a prison but more properly a refuge, a sanctuary ... an asylum. And just this once, perhaps the Francezcis were of a single mind where they stood at the rim of the well and Francesco quietly commented:\n \u0027It\u0027s as if the \"Mad\"-in Madonie were deliberate ...\u0027\n Tony at once cautioned him: \u0027Always remember, brother: he can hear you. Even when you\u0027re sleeping - or lost in your lust with some slut - he can be there. And he\u0027s here even now.\u0027\n And the other knew it was true. Down here their father\u0027s presence was everywhere. It was in the echoes of their voices; and despite the glaring lights - or because of them - it was in the movement of the blackest shadows back there where there should be no movement. It permeated the very atmosphere, as if the place were haunted. But the Old Ferenczy was no ghost. Nor would he ever be, so long as he was their oracle.\n Francesco looked at his brother. \u0027Well, are you ready?\u0027\n Tony licked his fleshy lips, and nodded. He wouldn\u0027t ever be \u0027ready,\u0027 not really, but what must be must be. He had always been the Old One\u0027s favourite, \u0027spoiled\u0027 by a father who had had time for him. As for Francesco: he had been too precocious; his father had never had time for him! Knowing something of the future - indeed, of most things -perhaps the pit-dweller had foreseen the time when Francesco would relish his ... incapacity.\n The electricity was off, the grille safe. \u0027Father,\u0027 Tony leaned over the rim of the old well and gazed down through the mesh on a receding funnel of massive blocks of masonry. \u0027We\u0027ve brought you something. A small tribute, a gift - a girl!\u0027\n A girl. . . a girl. . . a girl, the well repeated, an echo carried on the miasma. But a miasma, here? A wisp of mist, anyway, rising from the pit. The heat of the spotlights vaporized it, turning it to stench. The thing below might not be especially active, but it was there. It was breathing, and ...\n \u0027... Listening!\u0027 said Francesco, who was sensitive to such things. \u0027Oh, he hears you, all right!\u0027\n \u0027Father,\u0027 Tony leaned out more yet. \u0027We\u0027ve brought a gift for you, but we have our needs, too. There are things we need to know ...\u0027 For a moment there was nothing, and then the well seemed to sigh! It was physical - in that a gust of foulness rushed up from below - but it was also mental: the Old Ferenczy\u0027s telepathy, which in the brothers\u0027 case had skipped a generation. And despite that they were not mentalists, still their father\u0027s power was such that finally they \u0027heard\u0027 him:\n Only ask, my son ... after you have sent me my tribute.\n But if the message was simple, its delivery was dramatic. It reverberated in their heads like a shout, and was accompanied by a tumult of tittering, crazed background \u0027voices\u0027 that were all their father\u0027s. He had concentrated part of his mind on his answer, but the rest of it was engaged in its own activity ... the way a madman might often seem calm on the outside, while in fact he seethes within. And the many personalities of the thing - his diverse identities - were like a bickering, uncontrollable, heckling audience to the efforts of the part which now attempted to communicate with the world outside itself; in fact with the thing\u0027s son.\n Tony reeled at the rim of the pit; his brother caught his shoulder to steady him; the mental babble subsided, along with the \u0027echoes\u0027 of their father\u0027s true or \u0027sane\u0027 voice. And:\n \u0027Dangerous!\u0027 Tony muttered. \u0027He isn\u0027t in control.\u0027\n \u0027Or is he simply playing with us? Francesco scowled. \u0027His split-personalities, multi-identities: it wouldn\u0027t be the first time he\u0027d used them to confuse us ...\u0027\n Tony nodded, grimaced, and called down: \u0027Father, plainly you are not yourself. The girl will keep, and we\u0027ll try again later.\u0027 He made himself believe it - in his mind - in case his father was listening. But then, as they reached for the metal platform hanging over the pit, as if to swing the girl aside:\n NO! came that enormous mental grunt from below. NO, WAIT! And a moment later - less forcefully, almost pleadingly now, as they paused - Does she come of her own free will? Is she pure? Is she ... clean?\n And the brothers grinned at each other, nodding in unison. For this time there had been no background \u0027static,\u0027 no babble of crazed, secondary voices. When the thing in the pit desired it, he could control himself and shut them out.\n Tony waited a moment, then said, \u0027She has no will. As for purity: it\u0027s hard to find, father, in today\u0027s world. But clean?\n She\u0027s as clean as we can make her, yes. Except ...\u0027\n Yessss?\n \u0027She knows things, which we would know. She\u0027s yours, but before you use her, will you not first examine her? For us?\u0027\n For a long moment there was silence, until: But. . . why don\u0027t you examine her, my son? Before you give her to me? The old thing\u0027s mental voice was sly now, wickedly intelligent.\n \u0027He knows,\u0027 Francesco grunted, coldly furious. \u0027He knows that we can\u0027t ask her, that even the best drugs won\u0027t open her up, because she\u0027s been forbidden to speak! Her mind\u0027s been tampered with, locked from inside, and only he can get in. And he knows that, too! The old devil wants us to beg!\u0027\n And: Oh, ha! ha! ha! laughed the thing, as the \u0027miasma,\u0027 his breath, thickened. Oh, but I hear and know you, my son, my . . .\n Francesco? The laughter ceased and the mental voice turned cold as ice. And still you have no respect...\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Francesco scowled. \u0027He thinks he\u0027s a Don!\u0027\n \u0027He was,\u0027 Tony reminded him. \u0027A Don of Dons, one of the first. So don\u0027t annoy him; don\u0027t even think, but let me handle this!\u0027\n And directing his thoughts and voice into the pit:\n \u0027Father, it was you who gave word of a certain threat. We acted on your word. For two centuries we have acted on it, and at last we have a lead. This girl has secret knowledge, buried in her mind. Nothing we do will give us access. But you ...?\u0027\n And in a moment - when they could almost hear the brain below working, and the body seething - / can do it, yessss!\n \u0027But will you?\u0027\n Yessss! Send her down.\n \u0027She must not be wasted,\u0027 Tony cautioned. \u0027Her knowledge can\u0027t be lost. It was risky bringing her here; we paid for her; we may never see another opportunity like this. And always remember, father, what threatens us threatens you...\u0027\n I understand, yessss. Send her down.\n \u0027But you are hungry, we know, and occasionaly ... impatient? And if - \u0027\n SEND HER DOWN - NOW!\n There seemed nothing else for it. Francesco operated the gear to open one flap of the grile, and together they manoeuvred the platform and girl into position over the open half of the pit. Finaly Tony broke an ampoule under her nose, and she groaned and shook her head a little. But before she could wake up more fuly, they sent her on her way to hel.\n Her weight was measured on a dial on the control console. She sank skty, seventy, seventy-five feet... and her weight became zero. \u0027Get it up!\u0027 Tony croaked, as Francesco reversed the gears. The platform came up empty. But down below:\n Suddenly the mental emanations - the blasts of raw, terrible emotion - were like a gale blowing in their heads! The brothers reeled, recovered, quickly closed and activated the grile. While in their minds, despite that they were scarcely gifted in the art, and that for once they were glad of it: Flesh, bone, and bloood! The openingsss of her body, her face! The entrancesss to heaven, to hell! Oh, I am a monster! Yesss, for a man could never do thisss! But I am not a man! I am Wamphyri! Wamphyyyrrriii!\n And above it all, a scream, just one - but a shriek to end all shrieks -as the girl came awake and felt. . . what? Her cry of shock, outrage, disbelief, was a sound to grate on the nerve endings forever. It came and went, as her mouth, ears, nostrils and head entire were crammed full of the thing, filled to brimming with him, as was her body.\n And not only the hammerblows of the Old One\u0027s thought processes, but pictures to accompany them: of a creeping, flowing, foaming something, never a human being, but with hands - oh, a great many -and mouths, and eyes, all converging on, soaking into, and expanding within, the girl.\n Then the bloating, the stretching, the rending!\n And the mist over the pit gradualy turning pink, stinking where its molecules came in contact with the grile ...\n A while later the Francezcis were surprised to find themselves close, touching, trembling, and slowly disengaged. Minutes had ticked by; the cavern was quiet again, or unquiet, and the pit... was just a pit, an old wel.\n Francesco looked at his brother quizzicaly, but Tony shook his head. \u0027I won\u0027t, couldn\u0027t, talk to him right now. So let him rest. Later, maybe ... \"\n But as they made to pass out through the steel-barred door into the exit shaft:\n HE\u0027LL BE UP! HE WILL BE UP! HE WILL BE UP! It was almost a cry of triumph, but quickly turning to sick terror. H-h-he wil be up, yes - in just a few years, three, or four at most - and then ... then he\u0027ll seek me out. . . seek us out. . . seek us all out!\n \u0027Who will?\u0027 Tony tried to ask. But dazed as he was from the mental blast, his voice was a croak. It made no difference, for he already knew, and his father had heard him anyway.\n Who? came a fading, awed, even frightened whisper in their minds. Who else butRadu? Who but Radu Lykan, eh?!\n And then a ringing cry like a soul in torment, or one lost forever in outer immensities: Raaaddduuu!\n And once again a whisper: Raaaddduuuuuu! ... that shivered into a shuddering silence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-1.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
