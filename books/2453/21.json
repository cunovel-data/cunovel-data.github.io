BONNIE JEAN AT HARRY\u0027S.\\n\\n \u0027First the place,\u0027 Darcy pushed the photograph back across the desk closer to Harry. \u0027We don\u0027t know much about it; its history is vague at best. But you can probably find out more localy if you\u0027re so inclined.\u0027 (In fact the \u0027probably\u0027 was redundant, for Darcy knew that the Necroscope could do just that - could actually talk to the original owners or builders, if he so desired - but he didn\u0027t want to broach that subject).\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he went on, \u0027it\u0027s called Le Manse Madonie, named after the mountainous region in Sicily where it stands.\\n\\n It was built about four hundred years ago on the foundations of a castle dating back to crusader times. And like most ancient properties, it\u0027s been added to and subtracted from for centuries.\\n\\n \u0027As to what it was originally: a watchtower looking out over the Tyrrhenian? Possibly. The redoubt of some princeling? We don\u0027t know. And actually it mightn\u0027t be so easy to find out after all - not from books, at least - because as far as we\u0027re able to discover most of its historical records have been destroyed. I mean, utterly.\\n\\n \u0027The one sure thing we do know is that it\u0027s stayed in the hands of the same family for centuries. Their line goes back a long way, you might say immemorially. But records? - forget it! Where they exist they\u0027ve been altered, updated, re-written from scratch. Not that there\u0027s much we can deduce from that; quite a few old families have skeletons in their closets. These people have cleared them out, that\u0027s all. Or maybe that\u0027s not all. It could be they were simply making room for a few new ones ...\u0027\\n\\n These people?\u0027 Harry sat wrapped in his own thoughts. He had absorbed all that Darcy had told him, which wasn\u0027t much so far. \u0027Well, it seems obvious to me that you\u0027ve been interested in \"these people\" for quite some time. And that\u0027s E-Branch I\u0027m talking about, keenly interested! So who are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re called the Francezcis,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027That\u0027s their family\\n\\n name, anyway: the current owners and occupiers of Le Manse Madonie. But as I\u0027ve said, it\u0027s been Francezci family property, oh, since the year dot. They\u0027re brothers, twins, but not identical. Anthony, or Tony, and Francesco Francezci. That is who they are, but it\u0027s what they are that interests us.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027So what are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027First the facts,\u0027 Darcy answered. \u0027Let me tell you what we know for sure, and then what we suspect. And finally we\u0027ll be down to best bets. The Francezci brothers are the sole surviving heirs to one of the richest families in the world.\\n\\n You can measure their wealth ... well, in billions! So we believe. Okay, okay!\u0027 He held up a hand. \u0027I said I\u0027d tell you only what we know, and we do know. But it isn\u0027t easy to tie these people, or their assets, down. Put it this way: if you could calculate their wealth in terms of the Italian economy - if you could find a way to put back half of what they have taken out -then Italy and Sicily wouldn\u0027t be in half the shit they\u0027re in now.\u0027\\n\\n Harry could see where they were going. \u0027Mafia,\u0027 he said, very simply.\\n\\n \u0027Shhh!\u0027 Darcy put a finger to his lips and pulled a mock-horrified face. \u0027What, the Francezci brothers? But that\u0027s akin to blasphemy, Harry! Even suggest such a thing in polite Italian society, you\u0027d be ostracised in a moment - and later you could end up circumcised, too, from the neck up! No one talks about them in such terms, but we\u0027re pretty damn sure it\u0027s how people think of them. Except... well it\u0027s amazing how things get warped with the passage of time. I mean, look at the so-called \"legends\" of Robin Hood, Jesse James, Ned Kelly - all the murderers and thieves who\u0027ve become folk heroes.\u0027\\n\\n As he paused for breath, Harry said, \u0027Are you telling me the Francezcis are heroes?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy grinned, or grimaced, and said, \u0027But when you\u0027re powerful enough you can be what you want to be. I\u0027l give you an example of what I\u0027m talking about. Some forty-odd years ago it was a Francezci -allegedly one \"Emilio\" Francezci, a shady\\n\\n \"uncle\" to Anthony and Francesco - who helped to organize the collaboration of a then underground Sicilian Mafia in the American invasion of 1943. That was a joint effort that came about as a direct result of an old debt owed by Emilio to Lucky Luciano, who was then rotting in an American prison cel.\\n\\n \u0027It was Emilio\u0027s \"suggestion\" that in exchange for Luciano\u0027s freedom and later extradition to Italy, Lucky might like to contact several Sicilian \"ex\"-capo friends on behalf of the American invasion force, and request that they and their \"ex\"-Mafia soldiers - who were still scattered throughout Sicily\u0027s villages - tighten the screws on what remained of II Duce\u0027s armed forces and make them an offer they couldn\u0027t refuse: life if they ran away, death if they chose to remain at their posts. Except while a clean sudden death as the result of an American blitzkrieg couldn\u0027t be guaranteed, a very ugly one on the cutting edge of some mafioso guerrilla\u0027s garrotte most certainly could!\\n\\n The reason for all those \"ex\"s is simple: you\u0027ve got to remember that at the time, Mussolini was hanging mafiosi from whichever handy lampposts he could find, and so it was a very good time to refute or better still cancel your membership in that organization! But the Mafia never dies; it might go away for a while, but it always comes back.\\n\\n And II Duce, by standing against them, had put himself in their line of fire. They wanted rid of him - and they certainly didn\u0027t want Hitler!\\n\\n \u0027Thus the American invasion of Sicily was a walkover, and the course of the war - and a great many world-shaping events since - was altered. And so while this Emilio Francezci might be a difficult man to trace, by which I mean that we know absolutely nothing about him, still he could become one of those fake folk heroes I was talking about. But then, I\u0027m told that there are people who idolize the memory of Al Capone, too ...\u0027\\n\\n Harry was silent a while, then said: \u0027But we are talking about Italy, or more properly Sicily, which is a place apart, surely? The way I understand it, graft, political corruption, crime in general, these things are almost a way of life. Just because this one Francezci - this \"Emilio\" - had bad connections, does that mean they\u0027re all tarred with the same brush? I mean, isn\u0027t everyone in that sort of culture tainted or at least touched by it, from the politicians down? ... Or up, as the case may be? What else have you got, Darcy? Why don\u0027t you tel me what brought about E-Branch\u0027s interest in the Francezcis in the first place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cut straight to the point, right?\u0027 Darcy answered. \u0027Okay, let\u0027s try that. E-Branch\u0027s interest in the Francezcis:\\n\\n \u0027Harry, I have prognosticators, people like Alec Kyle, yet unlike him, who are mainly interested in the future. The future of this country, and its welfare - and, I hasten to add, of the world as a whole. But charity begins at home. So what do I mean, these people are like Alec yet unlike him? Well, you were with us long enough to understand that no two sets of ESP skills are exactly alike. The talents of my precogs don\u0027t work like Alec\u0027s did, that\u0027s al. But they are skiled at making damn good guesses. Except as any precog will tell you, the future is devious as hell and therefore hard to gauge.\\n\\n But they do their best.\\n\\n The point is, as an island and a race we\u0027re moving closer and closer to Europe. Not in the physical sense, no, but ideologically, politically, and financially. So it would seem, anyway; so my precogs - my futurologists - have predicted. Well, if that\u0027s how it will be, it\u0027s how it will be. But in a future world where we are tied to Europe, we\u0027d like to give ourselves the best possible advantage. Just because we happen to be divided from Europe by the English Channel and the North Sea - a situation which has given us a positive advantage in the past - doesn\u0027t mean we have to be some kind of poor offshore relative, some sort of bare-arsed cousin!\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope was quick on the uptake. \u0027Your - futurologists? -foresee financial difficulties?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy was impressed. \u0027Among others,\u0027 he answered. \u0027French governments come and go like day follows night, and the French franc fluctuates accordingly. Then there\u0027s the deutschmark ... except there we\u0027re more worried about the past than the future! The old deutschmark may look good now, but it has one hel of a bad record, Harry. And as for the lira and the drachma? I mean, seriously, the pound sterling should end up tied to currencies such as those?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, you\u0027ve gauged something of the future, you\u0027re mindful of the lessons of the past, and you\u0027re now considering the present, right?\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027So that you can discover where the rot has set in, and stop it from spreading over here? Which led you to the Francezcis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Among others, right. But we\u0027ve had to tread oh-so-carefully. The Francezcis seem immune from any kind of accusation. I can give you several examples in the last decade where Italian governments have fallen just because they looked like they were pointing a finger in their direction! E-Branch is E-Branch, yes, but on an international scale even we don\u0027t have that kind of diplomatic clout. Let them get wind of the fact that we\u0027ve been checking on them ... why, even our plug could be pulled! And the intelligence of these people is awesome.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy had gone too fast. \u0027Hold it!\u0027 Harry held up a hand. \u0027You could get the plug pulled? Cease to function? But surely, you\u0027re first-line national security?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy sighed. \u0027We\u0027re E-Branch. There are people who should know better who still don\u0027t even believe in us, and others who want to cut our expenditure ... and we exist on a fucking shoestring anyway! And it isn\u0027t just idle flattery when I tell you that you, personally, have saved our skin time and again. You, your successes, are what\u0027s kept us afloat. We are ahead of The Opposition, which means we\u0027re successful. Ergo: we are allowed to exist. But the Francezcis are just too powerful for us. As a covert organization, we simply can\u0027t go against them. If we\u0027re right about them, we lack the clout to do anything about it. And if we\u0027re wrong and get found out - they\u0027d have us by the balls... \"\\n\\n Harry was thoughtful. Two brothers, that powerful? Just the two of them? What\u0027s their power-base - I mean, apart from money.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, of course, that\u0027s the most powerful force on Earth!\u0027 Darcy exclaimed. \u0027But okay, apart from money:\\n\\n \u0027Harry, they\u0027re like an octopus, with tentacles all over the place, in every kind of sinkhole. I mentioned their intelligence. Well, in the main that\u0027s their power-base, too. Except the rest of this is really deep and you might find it difficult to believe, even hearing it from me, even here at E-Branch HQ.\u0027\\n\\n Try me, anyway,\u0027 the Necroscope answered. \u0027See, I have a very open mind.\u0027 He actually smiled, and for a moment looked even more like the old Harry Darcy had known. And Darcy could see the humour of it: someone trying to tell Harry Keogh that something might be too hard to believe! And that someone just happening to be himself, Darcy Clarke, who could walk through a minefield blindfold, in snowshoes, and come through without a scratch. So that Darcy smiled, too, then chuckled, and the tension was that much more diminished.\\n\\n But in the next moment it was back to business, as Darcy said: \u0027Okay, then listen. These people, the Francezcis, aren\u0027t just a couple of big-time hoods. They\u0027ve got the weight of the Mafia behind them - the total weight! Of course they have, for they\u0027re advisers to the Mafia, like Dons of dons, or Godfathers of godfathers! But that\u0027s not nearly the end of it. For through the Mafia they\u0027re also advisers to the KGB and, on occasion ... to the CIA!\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope looked blank, as if he hadn\u0027t heard. But as it sank in, he cocked his head on one side and said,\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re what?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy nodded. \u0027You can\u0027t see it. Well, that\u0027s understandable. But remember the Lucky Luciano story, and then ask yourself why the Mob is still alive and well and living in a great many places even today, when every \"straight\" body in this big wide world would love to put them out of business for good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the CIA?\u0027 Harry still needed convincing. \u0027I mean, the first is acceptable, even plausible; naturally Mother Russia would love to undermine western capitalism. And what better way than by the corruption at its root? But the CIA?\\n\\n What kind of \"advice\" would the Central Intelligence Agency take - what kind would they even want - from people in bed with the Mob?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go back a step,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027First the KGB. I never said they were giving orders to the Francezcis. I wasn\u0027t hinting that they were sabotaging or manipulating financial institutions, or anything of that order - though they could well be, or at least setting up the machinery for it. I said the Francezcis were \"advisers.\" The key word is\\n\\n \"intelligence!\" And as I told you, the Francezci intelligence machine is awesome! Which is why the CIA uses them; their information is that good. But as to the kind of advice they offer ...\u0027 Darcy shrugged. The Branch isn\u0027t privy to that information. But it won\u0027t be small potatoes, you can bet on it. As to how it works: they\u0027ll tell the KGB stuff that doesn\u0027t conflict with CIA interests. Likewise, they\u0027ll offer information to the CIA if it doesn\u0027t drop the Russians in it.\\n\\n And the Mob benefits both ways by knowing what\u0027s going to go down world-wide. And everyone involved is grateful to the Francezcis. That\u0027s power, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n Harry was silent a while, then said: \u0027So, they\u0027re \"advisers\" of a sort to the Mob, the KGB, even the CIA ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027... And through them, advisers to their governments - just as\\n\\n Emilio Francezci was, when he advised that colaboration between the American invasion force and Sicily\u0027s Mob-in-Waiting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Information of that order,\u0027 Harry mused.\\n\\n \u0027Yes ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Inteligence is the key word,\u0027 the Necroscope continued to mul it over. \u0027Okay, so what is their inteligence machine? How do they organize it? What\u0027s the source of their information? Maybe they\u0027re simply the Mob\u0027s own CIA: the nerve-centre in a spiderweb of international crime and corruption?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shrugged again. \u0027Possibly. But unlikely. For let\u0027s face it, the Families aren\u0027t that... wel, familiar with each other. There are Mob wars going on even now in the USA; probably in Italy, too. They\u0027re not united. It isn\u0027t in their genes. But here\u0027s something to think about:\\n\\n \u0027Our precogs tell us that Communism is on the wane, certainly in Russia. So maybe the Francezcis are preparing the way for the Mob, or a faction of the Mob, in the USSR? That\u0027s a lot of turf, Harry! The point is, whatever they\u0027re doing, you can guarantee they\u0027re not up to any good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you - or the Branch - want me to throw some spanners in their works?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy held up his hands in protest. \u0027Hey, I told you we can\u0027t be involved! You asked me if there was someone you could hit for funds. Which suggested to me that maybe there was a way we could both benefit from ... wel, from what you do best. But if there\u0027s any fal-out from anything you do, the Branch can\u0027t be implicated. We aren\u0027t part of this scene.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What if I don\u0027t need the money that badly?\u0027\\n\\n Then let it go.\u0027\\n\\n The fact is I don\u0027t need the money that badly, or haven\u0027t so far.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You asked me to do something for you,\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027What can I tell you? I\u0027ve done it. Now al I\u0027m saying is this: that place in the photograph, Le Manse Madonie, houses money, treasures, gold, beyond your wildest dreams. Because we\u0027re sure that quite apart from what these characters have stashed away in the world\u0027s banks, they\u0027re also magpies. They - their family - have been accumulating goodies for a couple of hundred years! A lot of the wealth of Europe that vanished into Nazi coffers during World War Two still hasn\u0027t been accounted for. Hel, it never wil be while it\u0027s tied up in that place!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 The Necroscope raised a querying eyebrow. \u0027So even now I don\u0027t know it al?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I would have told you,\u0027 Darcy said at once. That\u0027s the whole idea of talking like this, surely? But so far we\u0027ve just been kicking it around, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about plans of the place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you weren\u0027t interested?\u0027\\n\\n Harry grinned, however tightly. \u0027But we\u0027re just kicking it around, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No plans. And their security is second to none. The space centre at Baikonur in Kazakhstan would be easier! That\u0027s probably an exaggeration, but I\u0027m sure you take my point.\u0027\\n\\n The Chateau Bronnitsy was secure, too,\u0027 Harry answered.\\n\\n Darcy nodded but made no reply. He didn\u0027t want to mention Harry\u0027s \"talent\" for getting into and out of places ... or the damage the Necroscope had done to some of the places he\u0027d been into. The Chateau Bronnitsy - once the headquarters of Soviet ESPionage - was only one of them. And Bronnitsy was no more.\\n\\n \u0027But that place was the very seat of evil,\u0027 Harry went on, \u0027while I\u0027m not yet convinced that these Francezcis are anything but big-time crooks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not asking you to destroy anything,\u0027 the Head of E-Branch shook his head. \u0027In fact, I\u0027m not asking you to do anything. If you do, it\u0027s your business and I don\u0027t even want to know. I\u0027m just pointing out the bull\u0027s eye in case you should ever want to do a litle target practice, that\u0027s al.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if during my \"investigations\" I should discover the Francezci\u0027s oracle, the source of their intelligence ...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027d be grateful, of course. Because if we could tap into that source ... it goes without saying that we\u0027d put it to better use than they do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And maybe queer their pitch at the same time?\u0027 Harry was on top of it. \u0027But you\u0027re not in any kind of hurry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Honestly, Harry, this was for you. If you use it, then you use it. And if you don\u0027t... wel, it\u0027s your choice. But as you say, if it\u0027s also of benefit to us so much the better.\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope gave it another moment\u0027s thought, said, \u0027Do we know what these brothers look like? Or their people? You\u0027ve told me their security at Le Manse Madonie is good. So what do they have up there?\u0027\\n\\n \"Their own private \"staff,\" \u0027 Darcy answered. \u0027Not massive by Mob standards - but, as I\u0027ve said, the Francezcis aren\u0027t Mob. They\u0027re bigger than that. They just pul strings; others do the twitching. And an army wouldn\u0027t be necessary anyway, not in a place as inaccessible as the Madonie. They have guards, their \"servants,\" a four-seater helicopter, and various types of surface transport. Localy, they like to travel in a stretch limo: which is about as close as they come to emulating their nearest and dearest!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry nodded. The Mafia. And Sicily is still Mafia H.Q.?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But definitely!\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027If the Francezcis ever required it, they could call up a lot of heavy-duty help. But not in short order. It takes time to get from Palermo into the Madonie - for some people, anyway.\u0027 With his last comment he averted his face, dug in a desk drawer, and\\n\\n came out with a handful of photographs which he tossed onto the desk top. \u0027Pictures of our friends,\u0027 he quickly returned to the original subject. \u0027Not very good ones, I\u0027m afraid. But the Francezcis appear to be the world\u0027s least photographed - and least photogenic - people!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can I take these with me when I leave?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 Darcy shook his head. \u0027Memorize by al means, but that stuff stays right here. I\u0027ll say it again: officialy, we aren\u0027t even interested in these people. We can\u0027t be identified as a source of information in this respect.\u0027\\n\\n Harry frowned. \u0027You make it sound like the Francezcis have influence over here, too.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027What, with the British Government? Are they \"advising\" our inteligence agencies, too? Another reason you\u0027re interested in them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t know what the Francezcis are or aren\u0027t into!\u0027 The other threw his hands wide. \u0027But with their inteligence, there has to be a real chance that they\u0027re players on our side of the pond, too. Not big as yet, but - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - Up and coming,\u0027 the Necroscope finished it for him. And: \u0027I have to admit, you\u0027ve got me interested. I\u0027m not keen on the idea of my country\u0027s strings being puled by some kind of super-criminal puppet-master, not now or in the future.\u0027\\n\\n He looked at the photographs.\\n\\n Three of the five pictures were of the same two men, taken from the same angle, same location. They\u0027d been snapped in grey evening light leaving a typicaly Italian or Sicilian building, descending a wide flight of steps. Other people were folowing on behind them but out of focus. In the first picture, the two were glancing directly at the camera, their eyes unseen behind the dark lenses of sunglasses, their handsome faces twisted by shock or surprise.\\n\\n In the second picture they loomed much closer, one of them pointing at the camera, his slash of a mouth barking some sort of question or order. In the third picture the pair were almost totally obscured by the five fingers of a gloved hand, reaching to cover the lense of the camera.\\n\\n In al of the photographs their features - while appearing handsome in an almost stereotyped Mediterranean fashion - were very indistinct, blurred; possibly by motion, or by the nerves of the cameraman. Dark hair brushed back, large ears lying flat to their heads, long, slender faces. Also, they appeared taler than the average Italian. Harry knew he would retain these lasting impressions of the Francezcis ... and one other: their lack of colour. For Italians, or Sicilians, they didn\u0027t seem to have too much colour ...\\n\\n \u0027A couple of cold-looking customers, right?\u0027 said Darcy, his voice reaching Harry as if from a million miles away.\\n\\n The Necroscope looked up. \u0027Hmm?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Crawly types.\u0027 Darcy puled a face. \"The result of misspent youths. Pale as a pair of long-time hustlers; spawn of the back aleys and the biliard hals - or in their case, of the dimly-lit, echoing rooms of Le Manse Madonie.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Being a bit theatrical, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 Harry frowned, and his thoughtful or faraway expression disappeared. \u0027And anyway, I thought you didn\u0027t know anything about Le Manse Madonie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, but I know something about them. They have a congenital disorder, a kind of photophobia: alergy to strong light. Which means they keep prety much to home. It\u0027s one of the reasons why we don\u0027t have beter pictures. No one has beter pictures. Another good reason is that they don\u0027t like people taking pictures! The felow who took these ... he was paparazzi, at the time of that nasty Aldo Moro business. It seems amazing to me that he ever got these pictures out of Sicily.\\n\\n Anyway, that\u0027s not al he got.\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shrugged, but in no way negligently. \u0027He was found hanging from a bridge in Naples a month later. Suicide - apparently.\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked at the other photographs. One of a squat man in a flying suit, and the other of a cadaverous type in a valet\u0027s uniform. \u0027And these people?\u0027\\n\\n The little stubby one is their pilot,\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027His name is Luigi Manoza. Until a couple of years ago he was working for one of the New York families. A local war took out his employer, and there were threats on Luigi\u0027s life, too. He fled to relatives in Sicily, ended up working for the Francezcis.\\n\\n The other one is their chauffeur, Mario. He doesn\u0027t have a second name - not that he\u0027s telling anyway. But he\u0027s a dead ringer for a certain \"Mario\" who was a highly-paid hit man for the Scarlatis in Rome in the late Sixties. He was \"the best\" at his infamous job; just the right sort of chap to be driving for the Francezcis!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nice,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But something seems wrong. I mean, for people who want to appear divorced from the Mob, these Francezcis seem to employ an awful lot of ex-soldiers.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shrugged. \u0027In Manoza\u0027s case, he was on the periphery. So he\u0027s a pilot, but he could just as easily be a gardener. The Mafia employs ordinary people, too, you know. As for Mario: he has no criminal record, was never brought to trial. It\u0027s hardly surprising: \"the best\" never are.\u0027\\n\\n The Necroscope dropped the photographs back on the desk and stood up. He held out his hand and Darcy shook it. But as Harry headed for the door:\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027I can stil find you some clean money if you want it.\u0027 Harry paused. \u0027I\u0027D make out,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m not short, not yet anyway.\\n\\n It depends how long it takes to find Brenda and the baby - if I find them. You\u0027re sure there\u0027s nothing your end?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shook his head. \u0027But we\u0027re keeping our eyes and our ears wide open.\u0027\\n\\n He watched Harry open the door and step out into the corridor. He wanted to cal him back, but didn\u0027t. He wanted to ask after his health again: were there any other problems - inside his head, maybe? But he didn\u0027t. It was always the Branch first. And if the Necroscope had looked back, seen Darcy\u0027s face right then, he would have known something was wrong. And maybe Darcy wanted him to. But Harry didn\u0027t look back.\\n\\n Instead, over his shoulder, he said, Thanks, Darcy. It\u0027s as much as I can ask.\u0027\\n\\n And then he closed the door behind him ...\\n\\n That night, Harry caled Bonnie Jean. Why, he could never have said. Maybe it was the three-quarters ful moon hanging in the sky over the budding trees beyond his garden wal. (Though why that should be a motive was just as big a mystery.) Or maybe it was simply that he\u0027d run out of B.J. \u0027s wine, which was probably why he\u0027d left Seatle and headed for home in the first place.\\n\\n But these were arguments the Necroscope had had before, if only with himself. And Bonnie Jean ... was just another of the mysteries of his life. Or was she more than that? An innocent? Harry was sure she was. But how innocent can someone who goes out intent on murder be? Except Harry wasn\u0027t alowed to think that way, and so he setled for innocent. Also, she was a damn good-looking woman and someone to talk to. Company, yes. Wel, if she wanted to be.\\n\\n And it looked like it could be a long night, spent tossing and turning. Especialy if Harry didn\u0027t have anything to drink. And damn it, he intended not to have anything to drink! So why cal Bonnie Jean?\\n\\n But he called her anyway.\\n\\n First he got one of her girls, then Bonnie Jean. She was in the bar, said she\u0027d take it upstairs. (For privacy, he imagined. She wanted privacy, to talk to him.) And she must realy have flown up those stairs, for after a few seconds:\\n\\n \u0027Harry? Is it really mah wee man himself?\u0027 Her voice - or words -were like warm fingers driven home through his butter brain, pressing buttons, switching channels, conjuring a different him. Then B.J. dropped the accent but retained her husky breathlessness: \u0027Funny, but I\u0027ve realy missed you, Harry ... \"\\n\\n And whatever misgivings he\u0027d had - if he had had any at al - were at once forgotten. \u0027Wel, I\u0027m back,\u0027 he found his voice. \u0027For the time being, anyway. And you told me to stay in touch ...\u0027 It seemed a weak, ineffectual way to broach what was on his mind. But the words just slipped off his tongue as if they were someone else\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027And if anything, your call is early,\u0027 B.J. said, without really thinking what she was saying. But it was a fact that the ful moon was stil a week away. Immediately realizing her mistake (why did this bloody man have this effect on her?), she went to add something, anything, but Harry beat her to it:\\n\\n \u0027I know what you mean,\u0027 he said, without really knowing. \u0027I seem a bit eager, right? Well, maybe it\u0027s the moon.\u0027\\n\\n That shocked her rigid, so that she found difficulty in answering: The moon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Over my garden wall,\u0027 he explained. \u0027I seem to have this tune in my head: \"Give me the moonlight, give me the girl, and leave the rest to me.\" Well, I have the moonlight, but...\u0027\\n\\n She sighed her relief, inaudible to Harry, and said, \u0027But no girl, eh?\u0027 And before he could answer: \u0027Where are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pretty close. I\u0027m home. Five or six miles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you find them? Your wife and child?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 the Necroscope answered, his voice showing no emotion one way or the other. B.J. wouldn\u0027t be able to tell if he was glad or sad. And the fact was that right now, Harry didn\u0027t know either.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a quiet night,\u0027 B.J. said. \u0027We\u0027ll be closing around twelve ... \"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t much, Harry thought, but she seemed to be saying so much more. And: That\u0027s more than three hours,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n Too long?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes ... no ... I don\u0027t have much to do. I mean I\u0027m alone and ... lonely, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to come here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can if you - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - No, don\u0027t. Look, why don\u0027t you tell me where you are, and I\u0027ll come to you? I\u0027ll take a taxi. The girls can take care of things here for one night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027l come now?\u0027\\n\\n He sensed her shrug. \u0027I could use a break. Have you eaten?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not in a while.\u0027 (It was true, he was starving!)\\n\\n \u0027Do you have any food in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No food,\u0027 he shook his head, despite that she couldn\u0027t see him. \u0027No drink either ...\u0027\\n\\n She answered pause for pause and finally said, Tm sure we can fix that. I mean, I\u0027ll pick something up on the way.\\n\\n So ... what\u0027s the address? Oh, and Harry, give me your \u0027phone number, too, in case I\u0027m delayed. The number I have doesn\u0027t work.\u0027\\n\\n And he told her both his address and telephone number. Why not? It seemed the most natural thing in the world to do ...\\n\\n Harry\u0027s address was scarcely the easiest place in the world to find. It\\n\\n was one of four Victorian houses standing in an uneven cluster on a riverbank a mile or two out of Bonnyrig, with undulating patchwork-quilt fields on three sides, dotted with dark copses here and there, and, during daylight, the rare hazy view of a distant steeple or square church tower.\\n\\n Just why any specific area falls derelict is hard to say, but this district definitely had. Three of the once-proud, even grand old houses were terraced and stood in high-walled gardens extending almost to the river. The two outer houses had been empty for years and were beyond redemption; their windows were gaping holes and their roofs were buckling inwards. They had been up for sale for a long time; every so often someone would come to look at them, and go away shaking his head. They were not \u0027desirable\u0027 residences. The central house was Harry\u0027s place. It was lonely, but he could talk to his Ma in private here and never fear that anyone would see him sitting on the riverbank mouthing nonsense to himself.\\n\\n Glimpsed through the trees lining the riverbank, Bonnie Jean\u0027s first view of the house was from a road on the far side of the river. She had asked the driver of her taxi to halt, and sat there a while just looking across the river. It was obvious which house was occupied: the ground floor lights were on; they flooded out and lit the sprawling garden, lending the place an eerie illumination. The house was alive, barely. But by comparison the others were stone dead.\\n\\n Yet oddly enough, B.J. didn\u0027t consider the place as a whole at all out of keeping with Harry Keogh\u0027s character. Indeed, she thought it suited him.\\n\\n The reason she had caused the driver to stop was simple: she\u0027d wanted to observe the house from a safe distance.\\n\\n But it was what it was, an old house on its last legs: hardly a \u0027safe\u0027 house as she would imagine such a place to be.\\n\\n And in any case, since Harry\u0027s people, his ex-employers, already knew about her - or something about her - it made little difference. But he had told her they were finished with him and that they\u0027d have no further interest in her.\\n\\n Following which she\u0027d made doubly sure by giving him certain post-hypnotic commands. But he was no ordinary man, this mysterious Harry Keogh, and it was something she\u0027d have to check up on anyway.\\n\\n After a while she\u0027d told the driver to carry on, and a minute later the taxi had crossed the river by an old stone bridge onto a rutted service road. The row of houses lay at the end of the road, and B.J. dismounted and paid her fare outside Harry\u0027s address: Number 3, The Riverside, the one with the lights.\\n\\n As the taxi pulled away, B.J. walked the moonlit ribbon of paving stones to Harry\u0027s door, which opened as she reached it. And Harry was there.\\n\\n Taking the brown-paper, Chinese-motif takeaway bags out of her hands as he ushered her inside, he looked harassed and was instantly apologetic about the state of the place. He had obviously been busy; his brow was damp with perspiration.\\n\\n \u0027But... you seem in a bit of a state!\u0027 she said, looking al around his spacious if sparsely furnished study, the only room that he\u0027d spent any time on, and that nearly a month ago. \u0027What on earth have you been doing, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n He grimaced. \u0027Er, tidying up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 She couldn\u0027t help but smile. Then I\u0027d hate to have seen it when it looked rough!\u0027 He nodded glumly. \u0027A mess, right?\u0027 She shook her head in bewilderment. \u0027And you live here?\u0027 \u0027Is it that bad?\u0027 He looked around, licked his lips nervously, nodded again. \u0027Yes, it is that bad.\\n\\n Well, actually, the house isn\u0027t too bad at all. It\u0027s been a decent old place in its time and was built to last. Which is as well, because it\u0027s seen some neglect. But the site ... is a mess, yes. The main thing is, this place is mine, and I can do it up. I\u0027ve only been here a while, after all. And I\u0027ve been busy. But the place has had a survey and doesn\u0027t seem to have any problems. I mean, structurally,\u0027 Harry opened his arms expansively, setting the Chinese takeaway bags swinging, \u0027it\u0027s just fine! I\u0027ll replace the carpets .\\n\\n . . well, eventually. And a few floorboards kind of creak. Er, the decor could be improved, I suppose. And I really don\u0027t know where all the dust comes from.\u0027 He sighed, and his poorly-feigned optimistic air disappeared in a moment. \u0027Then there\u0027s the paintwork, and a handful of roof tiles, and ...\u0027 Shrugging, he fell silent. \u0027But why this place?\u0027 There had to be a reason. \u0027It was my Ma\u0027s,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Then my stepfather\u0027s. They ... are dead now. It\u0027s just a place to be, I suppose, now that I\u0027m on my own.\u0027\\n\\n Listening to him, B.J. had felt his loneliness. She\u0027d been lonely, too -albeit in a different way - for a very long time now. \u0027Outside, from across the river, I thought it looked like you. The house, I mean. From a distance, it\u0027s still -1 don\u0027t know - rich?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not rich,\u0027 Harry shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027I mean its character,\u0027 she said. \u0027In the night, it looks like it has style.\u0027 \u0027Do I have style?\u0027\\n\\n B.J. nodded and cocked her head on one side. \u0027Wel, you\u0027ve certainly got something, Harry Keogh. Else I wouldn\u0027t be here.\u0027 Which was the truth, however she meant it. And, before he could answer: \u0027Where\u0027s the kitchen?\u0027 she asked, as she took the takeaway bags back from him. \u0027Or don\u0027t I want to know?\u0027 But thank God, the kitchen had been modernized ...\\n\\n They ate. Discovering that he really was hungry, Harry set to with a wil. B.J. watched him mainly, and toyed with the smaler portions of Chinese food that she had served herself. She had also been watching\\n\\n him as she\u0027d unpacked and reheated the food in his microwave: his keen interest in what there was to drink, and his obviously disappointed frown on sighting a botle of Liebfraumilch.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t want any (for which she was glad), settling for a can of Coke instead. But as she poured herself a glass, she said, \u0027The red wine is gone. What was left, anyway ... \" And the pause was pregnant as she stared at him.\\n\\n Harry was ready for it, but stil he glanced at her before looking away. That was bad of me,\u0027 he said. \u0027Would you believe me if I said I came to see you? I mean, you\u0027d asked me to stay in touch, and here I was about to go away. And I couldn\u0027t contact you.\u0027 \u0027But why break in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Break in? As in burglary?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027I didn\u0027t have to break anything. I told you: this is what I do best. It was my job, remember? And your place is a walk-in, believe me! From the back, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 She\u0027d thought she was so secure, but the fact was that she had been advised to employ more security at the rear of the premises. \u0027It was that easy?\u0027\\n\\n Til show you some time,\u0027 he said, hoping he would never have to. And he carried on eating.\\n\\n \u0027And you got past one of my girls,\u0027 B.J. wasn\u0027t finished. \u0027I move very quickly, and very quietly,\u0027 Harry said, knowing that she couldn\u0027t argue with that.\\n\\n \u0027But it was very wrong of you, anyway! What would I have thought or done, if I had been in and you had suddenly entered my bedroom? And as for stealing a botle of my wine ...!\u0027\\n\\n Harry grinned in what he hoped was a disarming manner. \u0027I left a caling card, that\u0027s al. You must have seen that ad on TV. You know the one: \"and al because - \" \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 \" - Harry Keogh loves red wine?\" \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Something like that, yes. But you know that stuff realy did have an adverse effect on me? And didn\u0027t I read something recently - about a mass-poisoning or some such - where certain European vintners were accused of topping up their wines with antifreeze? And now you tell me it\u0027s gone? What, did you actualy sel that stuff?\u0027\\n\\n What? Bonnie Jean could hardly believe it! Now he seemed to be accusing her of something! Also, this was beginning to sound a lot like one of Radu\u0027s word-games ... and if so, then Harry Keogh was good at them! But she kept her temper, answering: \u0027You know, you could be right? I tried it myself and the next morning felt like you looked that time. But no, I didn\u0027t sel it. I gave it to my customers to try - and they didn\u0027t like it either.\u0027 \u0027And so it\u0027s gone?\u0027 \u0027Finished, yes.\u0027\\n\\n Against his wil, Harry felt himself griting his teeth. He didn\u0027t quite know whether to be glad or mad. He should have taken all the bottles when he had the chance. But no, of course he shouldn\u0027t! It had to be for the best that the vile stuff was finished. And with it the \u0027after-image,\u0027 or whatever, of Kyle\u0027s alcoholism, obviously. For Harry was damned if he could fancy B.J. \u0027s Liebfraumilch! Exactly how it all tied up he couldn\u0027t say, but now, at last, it was over. It had to be over, because there was no more of B.J. \u0027s wine.\\n\\n And as if someone had pulled a plug in his brain, most of Harry\u0027s frustrations, anxieties and self-doubts went flooding away down the drain of his mind, leaving him relieved and cool where a moment ago he\u0027d been burning up.\\n\\n For perhaps, after all, he was that one smoker in ten million who could only smoke one brand ... and at last they\u0027d stopped making it! Yet even now, in the depths of his subconscious mind, a small voice was asking him: \u0027Oh, really?\\n\\n But what about Greece? I\u0027ll bet you can get it in Greece ...\u0027\\n\\n And there it was: the question right there on the tip of his tongue, making ready to blurt itself out: That friend of yours, the one who brought it back for you? You wouldn\u0027t happen to know where he got it, would you? Except he mustn\u0027t ask it! Never! Not if he would be his own man again. She came to his rescue, saying: \u0027All I knew was that someone had been into my place. I didn\u0027t think of you at first, but wondered if maybe it had been this organization you worked for. Maybe they were checking me out or something.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment that caught him off guard; he had quite forgotten the story he\u0027d told her about the Branch wanting him to clear up a point or two. But now she\u0027d brought it all back to mind, and since in fact E-Branch knew nothing at all about her: \u0027No, B.J., no one\u0027s out to get you,\u0027 he said. \u0027Like I told you, the people I worked for aren\u0027t police, and in fact they\u0027re not even remotely interested in you. Not any longer. Nor in me for that matter. And believe me, I really am sorry I caused you so much concern ... \"\\n\\n They finished the rest of the meal in an awkward silence, just mulling things over. But when Harry finally sat back, he sighed and said, \u0027You want to know something? I think this is the first time in - God, I don\u0027t know how long! - that I\u0027ve felt relaxed. Your choice of food was just great. And you ... are just great, too. Wrong-headed, maybe, but great. And anyway, who am I to talk?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who indeed?\u0027 she said, something like his Ma might, but with an entirely different feel to it. \u0027Was that a compliment?\u0027\\n\\n Harry laughed and rubbed his chin. \u0027I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 he answered, \u0027but it felt like a whole series of them!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your best line? Your idea of chatting me up? Seduction, even? To tel me that I\u0027m great despite that I\u0027m wrong-headed? Well, I have to say I\u0027ve heard better!\u0027 The way she said \u0027Well,\u0027 it really did sound like his Ma.\\n\\n The idea of red wine was now rapidly receding in the Necroscope\u0027s mind. B.J. had spoken several key words - words that had nothing to do with previous post-hypnotic commands - which Harry had picked up on. And now he realized what else he\u0027d been missing in the last eighteen months, other than his own body.\\n\\n Taking up the used plates and cutlery, and fumbling it a little, he said, \u0027Do you feel cold? Is it cold in here?\u0027 There had been a fire laid in his open fireplace ever since he moved in, but the Necroscope hadn\u0027t felt the need to light it. Normaly he didn\u0027t like it too warm, and perhaps surprisingly the house\u0027s oil-fired central-heating system was working very wel.\\n\\n She had seen his eyes rove over the hearth and had perhaps read something of what was on his mind. \u0027A little chily, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then toss a match on the fire while I wash up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Al right,\u0027 she said. \u0027And ... I\u0027d like to wash up, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ummm?\u0027\\n\\n The bathroom, is - ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Off the landing, upstairs,\u0027 he answered. \"The shower is ... very good.\"\\n\\n \u0027But I bet your bedroom\u0027s a mess, right?\u0027 The direct way was usualy the best and easiest. Even so, B.J. was surprised to find herself breathing a shade too fast.\\n\\n \u0027Actualy, no,\u0027 Harry answered, his voice a little husky. \u0027No, it\u0027s ... prety tidy. I, er, tidied it?\u0027 He paused in the doorway and looked back to where she was standing by the fireplace. Their eyes locked, and for a moment it was like it had been in her bar-room. There was this magnetism, which had nothing to do with the art of beguilement... or on the other hand, it was that entirely natural, mutual beguilement, the electric moment, when a man and woman know that it\u0027s going to happen.\\n\\n \u0027But now that the fire\u0027s lit,\u0027 she tore her eyes from his, struck a match and tossed it onto a base of crumpled newspaper and kindling, \u0027I think I would be just as comfortable ... down here?\u0027\\n\\n And beginning to burn as quickly as the fire, and just as hot, Harry husked, Then after you\u0027ve showered, bring down the quilt and soft top blanket from my bed.\u0027\\n\\n Then he was off to the kitchen, and B.J. licked her lips. The dog-Lord was right: there were other ways, beter ways, to enthral a man. With the lights off and the curtains drawn, in the red glow of the fire, it would be just like a warm, secret cave in here.\\n\\n Yes, it would be just like a lair ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-21.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \\n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
