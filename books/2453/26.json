He dumped his smal but heavy burlap sacks and unzipped his jacket into a wardrobe, deflating himself like a marquee with a snapped kingpost. Then, moving at a frenzied pace, he was out again.\\n\\n At Le Manse Madonie: only nine or ten seconds had passed; the Francezci brothers were at the outer vault door, where Tony expertly spun the combination lock in a sequence that disarmed the alarms. But already Francesco was asking: \u0027Why did he lock the fucking place up again? And how did he - how could he - get past us on his way out? Or\\n\\n ... is he still here, one of us?\u0027 He glared all about, at the small party of thralls gathered in the tunnel.\\n\\n They stared back at his writhing features, the unequivocal guarantee of murder written clear in his scarlet eyes and flaring, convoluted nostrils.\\n\\n Tony had the outer door open; he made to step through into the airlock section . . . paused, lifted his head, and sniffed at the air. And, nostrils gaping, he inhaled frantically, disbelievingly - then choked and grabbed his brother\u0027s elbow.\\n\\n They all smelled it at the same time: gas!\\n\\n Tear-gas, in the ventilation system!\\n\\n The lieutenants and thralls reacted instantly: they stumbled about in the tunnel, coughing and choking, blinded by their own tears, as the atmosphere became tinged with a trace of yellow from the tunnel\u0027s ducts. But a trace was enough.\\n\\n Not enough for the Francezcis, however. Not yet. Wamphyri, they had more control over their bodies. The gas couldn\u0027t hurt if they didn\u0027t breathe it in. Their eyes wouldn\u0027t sting if they shuttered them with transparent membranes.\\n\\n The membranes would sting, but sight would remain unimpaired for a while at least.\\n\\n Francesco put the second combination to rights as his men began to\\n\\n leave the tunnel, staggering away through the reek of the place, colliding with each other, their torches probing the misty-yellow, gradually thickening atmosphere. He spun the dial this way and that, and finally swung the door open -on an inferno!\\n\\n Hot metal had set fire to paper money and burlap; shelving sprawled in twisted disarray; art treasures lay blackened, broken in the roil of dense smoke and fumes. Electrical conduits burned, sparked, sputtered. Flames licked up the rear wall and gouted on the ceiling, emitting the greasy black smoke and gut-wrenching stench of destruction, as fabulous oil paintings submitted to the heat. A wall of heat came scorching out of the strong-room!\\n\\n There were fire extinguishers, but many of them were damaged, blasted loose from their seatings on the walls. It took quite some time for the Francezcis to find two that were still working, and a lot longer to bring the wreckage of the treasure vault under a semblance of control. And of course they must do it themselves in the stinging yellow fog, through all the tears and blood and rage of their hellish vampire eyes -for as yet their thralls were only human after all...\\n\\n Harry emerged from the Continuum at Humph\u0027s co-ordinates deep underground - where the American\u0027s unauthorized explorations had been challenged more than forty years ago, and from which he\u0027d been marched under escort before his employers - in that wide, spiralling stairwell that led upwards to the junction of five tunnels and downwards ... to what? A secret place that no one was allowed to see. Which was why the Necroscope must see it.\\n\\n It was very confusing. He told himself it was to satisfy his \u0027natural curiosity,\u0027 but in fact it was to satisfy B.J.\u0027s post-hypnotic command that he seek out the Wamphyri. Oh, she\u0027d yet to turn him loose officially, but he knew her purpose, and it had become his. It would have been his purpose anyway, whatever the circumstances; but at the same time he\u0027d been ordered to store away whatever information he discovered -to \u0027forget it,\u0027 place it in limbo - until B.J. or Radu brought about its resurgence.\\n\\n The result of which was that he was now here, investigating a monstrous survival, a powerful and esoteric branch of the most dreadful \u0027dynasty\u0027 to ever infest mankind with its evil - the Ferenczys. And on this level he worked without conscious thought with regard to any outcome, but certainly with regard to his own safety. He was in thrall, but he was still Harry Keogh ...\\n\\n Down here, there was as yet no tainted air. In these nethermost extremes of Le Manse Madonie, the performance of the air conditioning system was at its slowest, the circulation languid at best. But up above ... Harry could hear the hoarse shouting, the crying of men scrambling for fresh air. And they wouldn\u0027t find it until they were out of the building proper, out in the night. That was good, for they wouldn\u0027t be coming down here.\\n\\n On the other hand Harry knew his own limitations, too. He was sure that the tear-gas would soon find its way through the system and back to him. Wherefore time was of the essence.\\n\\n He went down the spiralling steps through several complete revolutions, until he arrived at a door formed of parallel bars of steel set in vertical stanchions. A warning sign - an openly displayed red lightning flash - warned that the bars were electrified. Beyond the door the floor was fairly level but uneven, and showed the natural stratification of rock; the place was a cave at the terminal point, the very lowest level, of Le Manse Madonie\u0027s excavations.\\n\\n Well back from the bars on Harry\u0027s side of the door, there were twin, rubber-handled switches set in a panel bolted to the wall. One of these was marked with a lightning flash; the other was likewise pictorial, showing a series of horizontal bars. It couldn\u0027t be simpler. Harry threw both switches, waited until a mechanism hummed and the bars slid from left to right through the housing stanchion. The door stood deactivated, and open.\\n\\n Of course the Necroscope could have simply taken the Mobius route into the natural cavern beyond the door, but he\u0027d been interested in the operation of the mechanism; plainly the technology here antedated Humph\u0027s vault doors.\\n\\n Also, this door was never intended to keep people out - which gave Harry pause as he stepped across the threshold into the dimly-lit cave beyond.\\n\\n There was a nest of supplementary light switches mortared to the wall; when he switched them on, a battery of spotlights high in the walls lit the cave with a briliance that was dazzling. It took a few moments for Harry\u0027s eyes to adjust. Then he saw that the main focus of the spotlights was the mouth of a great circular well whose wall was of massive blocks of old hewn masonry.\\n\\n The Necroscope took it all in at a glance: the well, its electrified wire-mesh cover, the hoist with its metal platform, throwing a gallow\u0027s shadow across the mouth of the well... or the pit? And the deeper shadows, sharp-etched, marching away into the cavern\u0027s unseen corners. But the walled pit was definitely the place\u0027s centre of focus. And perhaps \u0027well\u0027 was a better description after all; Harry could make out a thin mist issuing from its throat, vaporizing on contact with the cover.\\n\\n That this place was a facility, that it was used, however infrequently, was obvious. The door, spotlights, hoist, electrification ... all of these things spoke volumes however inarticulately. But what was it used for?\\n\\n In the very instant of his inwards-directed question, the Necroscope was warned not to ask it. Too late; Harry\u0027s\\n\\n \u0027natural curiosity\u0027 had let him down; his mental guard was down, and his every thought was like a spoken word to the dead. Of which Le Manse Madonie - and the \u0027pit\u0027 in\\n\\n particular - had more than its fair share. They might have remained silent, but his query; \u0027What was this place used for?\u0027 galvanized or even shocked them into grotesque activity. It had been akin to showing the long-healed victims of some hideous torture the implements of their suffering. Except it was much worse, for these victims were not yet healed.\\n\\n The use of this place, of the pit? But they had been part of its use - as they were even now part of the creature in the pit! And while he, it, was not quite insane, they were - driven mad, because they remembered what they had been, and knew what they\u0027d become.\\n\\n The Necroscope gaped; his jaw fell open in that same split second; the short hairs stood up stiff at the back of his neck, because he sensed the coming onslaught. But this time - however strangely, inexplicably -he was ready for it. He somehow knew these people ... he had heard their dead voices before, but had forgotten them because they were part of something that he had been ordered to forget. Now, however, he was once more performing in that earlier \u0027mode,\u0027 so that for the time being his subconscious memory was intact again. And:\\n\\n Him! (The one with the small, timid voice).\\n\\n He was here befoooore! (The one who growled).\\n\\n He\u0027s back! back! back! (A voice that seemed to echo).\\n\\n He didn\u0027t listen, didn\u0027t run! (The agonized girl, her pain still fresh in her incorporeal mind).\\n\\n He must be as mad as we are - har, har, haaarrrrgh! (The utterly crazed one, whose \u0027laughter\u0027 had sounded like bullets, and now sounded like a soul tearing).\\n\\n But all of them beating on Harry\u0027s metaphysical mind simultaneously, so that he had difficulty sorting them out; beating almost physically, great hammerblows of passion, rage, or terror. And not only for themselves but for him.\\n\\n \u0027Dead!\u0027 the Necroscope heard himself gasp out loud. \u0027But where? How?\u0027 Again that question. And in answer: Here! (All of them in unison, explaining the where of it). In the pit! And another voice - like the breath of hell, like the croak of some gigantic, obscene toad - that cowed them all to silence in a moment, explaining the how of it: IN ME...!\\n\\n Contact with the group had been through Harry\u0027s talent: he was the Necroscope and conversed with the dead. But this other contact was different. It was telepathy, which Harry recognized in a moment. But how could it be, when its source was the same? They had the answer to that, too:\\n\\n But we\u0027re part of Him, the terrified girl, perhaps not so terrified after all - or simply stronger, more determined than the rest - told him. The Francezcis ...\\n\\n BE QUIET!\\n\\n ... They fed its to him! She finished in a whisper.\\n\\n He. Him. Something in the pit. Something that breathed air, creating the miasma rising from the throat of that now terrible hole. But... something alive?\\n\\n Obviously - yet when Harry had spoken to them in his unique fashion, it had answered him back.\\n\\n THEY\u0027RE DEAD! The thing told him at once, its massive mentality gonging in Harry\u0027s mind. BUT THEIR MINDS LIVE ON IN ME ...\\n\\n And because telepathy and the language of the dead frequently convey more than is actualy said, now Harry had the whole picture, or thought he did: The Francezci brothers - Wamphyri, last survivors of the dread Ferenczy dynasty - had grown something in this pit, even as Yulian Bodescu had grown that Other thing in the celars of Harkley House in Devon, England. But where Bodescu\u0027s beast had been a mindless monstrosity sprouted of his own vampire flesh, a thing of little or no original inteligence, this construct of the Ferenczys was hugely intelligent! It gathered knowledge from the minds of those it consumed. It was powerfuly telepathic; it was in Harry\u0027s mind even now, leeching his knowledge. He could feel it - its eagerly groping fingers - and slammed the doors of his mind on it, to shut it out before it learned too much! Its hold was broken; Necroscope and pit-thing stood off, \u0027face to face,\u0027 as it were, weighing each other up; Harry felt its awesome vampire probes fumbling at the outer reaches of his identity.\\n\\n But while telepathy is one thing, communication with the dead is something else; while the thing in the pit could \u0027hear\u0027 Harry and its \u0027own\u0027 absorbed vestigial multi-minds speaking - and while it might occasionaly cow those consumed identities, or shout them down - it was mainly incapable of anything but threats.\\n\\n For you can\u0027t any longer hurt the dead. And the girl, the one whose agony was still so fresh, seemed finaly to have recognized that fact and was talking to Harry, begging him to:\\n\\n Run! Oh, run! You\u0027re warm and alive ... you don\u0027t want to be like us, cold and dead! So run!\\n\\n \u0027But I have to know,\u0027 Harry told her, as he sniffed the first faint reek of gas. \u0027What ... what is he?\u0027\\n\\n He is their seer, their scryer, their crystal ball. He\u0027s their machine: they aim, direct him, and he gathers knowledge for them. Even from across the world! He is their oracle! And more than that, he -\\n\\n - I WAS THEIR FATHER! The great voice was back, breaking through all Harry\u0027s barriers. But now there was a gasping sob in it, an all-consuming grieving, a sense of great loss, like the loss of being - or of the control of being. I WAS\\n\\n ANGELO FERRENZIG, FERENCZINI, FRANCEZCI. AND I WAS THE MASTER OF METAMORPHISM -UNTIL\\n\\n METAMORPHISM MASTERED ME!\\n\\n Again, more was conveyed than was spoken. Much more:\\n\\n The Necroscope\u0027s skin crept as he saw the seething horror of a grotesque birth . . . twins, one of which was a monster from first gasp and destroyed at once. The other was Angela, bloodson of Waldemar, and apparently normal. . . A thousand years of vampire life, until his metamorphism ran rampant, became a disease, reduced or exploded him to what he was now.\\n\\n If Harry had wondered how many generations of Francezcis? - then he wondered no longer. The answer was one: the brothers themselves, twins sons of Angelo Ferenczini, born toward the end of his time as ... as a man! For as his disease had taken hold on him, he had determined to extend something of his loathsome existence into the future. Or ... perhaps he had hoped to do a lot more than that, which was why he was now trapped down here and not free-roaming. For Harry had ample evidence of the tenacity of the Wamphyri; he knew that if there\u0027d been any way for this creature to continue as \u0027a whole man,\u0027 then that he would have found it - or would yet find it! - perhaps in one of his sons, if they\u0027d not seen fit to trap him down here first.\\n\\n So, how long had he been here? Two, three, four hundred years? And all that time his sons inhabiting Le Manse Madonie, sometimes as one person and at others as brothers. Little wonder there was a long history of twins - for they were the same twins!\\n\\n They would live here for a while (until one of them had to \u0027die\u0027 and for a time live elsewhere,) then reverse the process, \u0027rejuvenate,\u0027\\n\\n come together as sons and brothers again. And always there would be at least one \u0027keeper\u0027 here.\\n\\n But their father was Faethor Ferenczy\u0027s brother, or half-brother, out of a different mother, Constanza de\u0027 Petralia. Had Angelo not known -didn\u0027t he know? - of his sibling in a different time, a different land? And what of the long-dead Faethor? Did he not know of Angelo? He had never mentioned him to Harry. But then, Faethor had usually kept himself apart; his interests had been limited, divided between war and his mountain territories, and bitter hatred of his egg-son, Thibor the Wallach. Or perhaps the two had known of one another but simply stayed well apart. And anyway, what would it have profited Faethor to speak of this Angelo, whom he never met? And if he had spoken of him, would it have been the truth? For of all liars, there is none like a vampire: fathers not only of monsters, but of lies!\\n\\n Harry gave up on it; there were discrepancies enough in the history of the Wamphyri, as the Necroscope had long-since discovered ...\\n\\n But though all of this - these incredible revelations, and the presence of the thing in the pit - was mind-staggering, still Harry had to know the worst of it. And through the first faint wisps of a yellow mist, he stumbled to the rim of the pit, avoided the wire-mesh, ignored his stinging eyes and gazed down the throat of the awful shaft.\\n\\n Down there, looking back up at him through its own miasma, something with burning sulphur eyes quivered and surged ...\\n\\n Get out of here! the multi-minds urged him, while the Necroscope reeled with the knowledge - the vision - of what had driven them half or wholy mad. But: OUT OF HERE? Angelo Ferenczy was quieter now, his \u0027voice\u0027 dripping sarcasm. OUT OF LE MANSE MADONIE? BUT CAN\u0027T YOU SEE? HE CAME OF\\n\\n HIS OWN FREE WILL - AND UNINVITED. THERE\u0027S BUT ONE WAY OUT, WHICH HE WILL FIND BARRED, I AM SURE! AND EVENTUALLY ...\\n\\n AH, IT WILL BE A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO HIM AGAIN, BUT MORE INTIMATELY NEXT TIME! OH, HA HA HAAAA!\\n\\n Dizziness, nausea, that same mental confusion which had left Harry so helpless on the road below Le Manse Madonie the previous afternoon, struck again! But this time he knew what it was. The mental power of the thing in the reeking pit - of Angelo Ferenczy, or what was become of him - was awesome. The Necroscope could only think of his own safety now. And he knew that the multi-minds of those that the thing had devoured were quite right: he should run, get out of here with al speed.\\n\\n Harry staggered back from the pit amidst thickening clouds of yelow and conjured a Mobius door. It took unaccustomed effort... the gas was in his eyes and lungs; the multi-minds were shouting at him, telling him to run, run; and the ancient, hideously mutated Ferenczy was tearing aside the Necroscope\u0027s mental barriers like so much tissue paper.\\n\\n Panic set in. Confused, Harry saw half-a-dozen co-ordinates displayed on the screen of his mind, places he could escape to. Such as his old flat in Hartlepool; or beter still the Hartlepool cemetery, for the flat was probably occupied by now ... or (most obvious) his hotel room in Paterno ... or his study, garden, or bedroom at the house in Bonnyrig ... Except he could no longer think of that last without B.J. Mirlu also crossing his mind. Everything was so confused and confusing!\\n\\n The pictures in the Necroscope\u0027s mind were automatic, instinctive; lacking an explanatory \u0027narrative,\u0027 they gave little or nothing away. But the girl - the mind of the dead girl who had not yet forgoten the agonies of her dying - seized upon one of them and clung to it.\\n\\n And: Bonniejean! she cried. B.J. Mirlu sent you!\\n\\n And because she was part of Angelo Ferenczy, he heard her, too. MIRLU? RADU LYKAN\u0027S THRALL? THIS ONE IS ... ONE OF RADU\u0027S? Then, his awful mind registered uter terror! His mental probes were immediately withdrawn; they released their grip on Harry\u0027s mentality, writhing back from him as if he were suddenly white hot. And in a way Angelo was right: Harry was one of Radu\u0027s.\\n\\n Go! The girl cried. Hurry! You can\u0027t help me. No one can. So go now, if you still can. And tell B.J. - tell her ...\\n\\n But Harry never found out what he should tel Bonnie Jean, for at that moment Angelo exerted his telepathic power over all the shrieking multi-minds and closed them down, and the psychic aether was empty as deep space. By which time -\\n\\n The Necroscope was in even deeper space: that of the Mobius Continuum, where he twirled aimlessly for what seemed a long time, before a co-ordinate surfaced from the whirlpool deeps of his metaphysical mind and he fled to its source: His room at the hotel in Paterno ...\\n\\n Harry woke up from an instantly forgotten nightmare, woke with a splitting headache, sweating and shivering and nauseous. But he fought it down and lay still, and in the light of a bedside lamp took in his surroundings. The hotel, yes. His room at the Hotel Adrano. In Paterno. Sicily.\\n\\n It al came flooding back - or it didn\u0027t, not al of it:\\n\\n Le Manse Madonie, the treasure vault, the tear-gas - and the money!\\n\\n At that he came off the bed so fast it set his mind, and his body, reeling again. And his clothing stank of gas. God - no wonder he felt nauseous! He\u0027d been hit by his own tear-gas! But the money ... was it real? Nothing/eft real. It al felt like some badly fragmented dream, as if something was missing. So what else was new?\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t felt right from the first moment he got to this fucking place!\\n\\n But after he\u0027d opened the windows to his balcony, and then opened the wardrobe ...\\n\\n It was no dream, and nothing was missing. Not of his loot, at least. A burlap bag slumped over on its side, and a handful of gold coins slipped from the rim and set off on their diverse courses, wobbling across the polished boards. Their miled rims purred on varnished pine; they thumped heavily where they colided with the carpet trim and fel on their sides.\\n\\n And in the wardrobe where he\u0027d emptied his jacket - bundles of high denomination notes! A suitcase ful. Pounds, deutschmarks, dolars, in fifties and hundreds. And the Krugerrands: twin burlap sacks weighing at least thirty pounds each! Sixty pounds of solid gold!\\n\\n And al of this money here in his room, in the night, in Sicily. Harry broke out in a sweat again. He wasn\u0027t a thief - but he was now! But so were the Francezcis.\\n\\n And what the hel, he\u0027d known what he was doing. And what it was for. But...\\n\\n ... He had to get it out of here!\\n\\n He did, to the old house in Bonnyrig. Then returned to the Hotel Adrano, and lay tossing and turning al through the rest of the night, unable to sleep.\\n\\n Rising with the sun, Harry checked out of the hotel. He didn\u0027t dare simply disappear, for that would be to invite investigation. But having checked out, then he disappeared - back to his home in Bonnyrig, where at last he would be able to set the wheels of a real search in motion.\\n\\n In his house - which felt unaccountably strange and empty now, as if he\u0027d been away for a week at least - Harry secreted the money away and began to feel a little easier. And then, to make up for the deficiencies of last night, he slept...\\n\\n ... But only for an hour, until the sun rose again for the second time in just sixty minutes.\\n\\n It was the telephone that brought him awake; Bonnie Jean\u0027s husky voice inquiring oh-so-knowingly, \u0027Is that mah wee man?\u0027\\n\\n And oh, yes, it was him. And he was hers, beyond a doubt:\\n\\n The full moon, its golden light streaming down ... B.J.\u0027s strange eyes, undergoing an even stranger metamorphosis ... and a wolfs head in silhouette, dark against the disk of the moon.\\n\\n Harry said nothing, because her words hadn\u0027t been a question but a trigger. On the other end of the line BJ. understood his silence, smiled at it and asked him:\\n\\n \u0027Wel, did you get your finances sorted out? You can answer normaly, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er, yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m al fixed up now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And ready for a weekend\u0027s climbing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ready as I ever wil be,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027\\n\\n She arranged a meeting for lunch: 12:00 noon, at a little place she knew outside Falkirk, about half-way to where they\u0027d be climbing. And she finished by asking him, \u0027How wil you get there?\u0027\\n\\n Til bike it,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027Looks like a nice day. I should enjoy the ride.\u0027 It was no lie; he would bike it - some of the way, anyhow.\\n\\n He sensed B.J.\u0027s surprise. \u0027But that\u0027s -1 don\u0027t know - maybe fifteen miles?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027l be seting out about 9:30. Plenty of time.\u0027\\n\\n Til have my car. I could pick you up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I ... think I\u0027l enjoy the fresh air.\u0027\\n\\n At last he sensed her shrug. \u0027Wel, okay, just as long as you save some of your energy. Er, for the climbing, I mean ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027l have enough of energy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very wel then,\u0027 she laughed. Til see you around midday. Afterwards, when we\u0027re done, we can always put your bike on the roofrack and I\u0027ll drive you home ... mah wee man.\u0027\\n\\n Which left Harry feeling as if the world had blinked and for a moment he\u0027d felt the darkness. But al he could remember was that he had a date with Bonnie Jean, and that she was innocent, of course.\\n\\n But innocent of what ... ?\\n\\n At Le Manse Madonie there was hell on. There had been hell on all night. And unheard by the brothers\u0027 lieutenants and common thralls (their servants or \u0027soldiers,\u0027) and ignored for now by the Francezcis themselves, because they were busy, the ancient thing in the pit had wailed piteously, continuously to itself for hours now.\\n\\n And one by one the interrogations went on: the \u0027household staff were called forward one after the other into Francesco\u0027s private rooms; he and Anthony talked to them, threatened them, required them to admit responsibility for last night\u0027s damage and robbery.\\n\\n Or if they weren\u0027t directly responsible, to admit that they\u0027d been seduced by some outside agency, and were part and parcel of the break-in. To no avail; but the brothers had known that from the start; it was simply something that had to be done.\\n\\n Finally it was done. Le Manse\u0027s staff, sufficiently cowed but all perfectly \u0027innocent\u0027 - or as innocent as vampires can be - were back at their duties; the Francezcis could now begin to consider, or at least attempt to consider, the mechanics of this thing. Which had to be the most frustrating, infuriating part, for it was patently impossible.\\n\\n Francesco paced, while Tony sprawled in an easy chair. The latter looked entirely exhausted, but his looks were deceptive.\\n\\n Wamphyri, he was simply exhausted of ideas. But in fact he was the most \u0027sensitive\u0027 or \u0027passive\u0027 one, while Francesco had all the aggression.\\n\\n \u0027We should have Guy Cavee in again!\u0027 Francesco burst out. He strode to the hugely heavy curtains, looked for a moment as if he might draw them, tear them aside. But out there, all was brilliant sunlight. And throughout Le Manse Madonie all of the curtains would stay closed until sundown. The Francezcis had a woman whose sole responsibility it was to open and close curtains. No one else touched them, not even the brothers.\\n\\n The night watch? To what end?\u0027 Tony lolled in his chair. \u0027He gave warning, while still the intruder was in the vault.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t know that!\u0027 Francesco rounded on him. \u0027If Cavee is lying, the thief could have been in there - and out of there - before he called out. If there was a plot, he is the obvious one to have been in on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if he is lying,\u0027 Tony waved a slender, languid hand, \u0027then he\u0027s also planning his escape from this place. Indeed, he would be fled by now, or dead by his own hand. For he must know that when, if, we discover the truth ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In any case,\u0027 Francesco stopped pacing. \u0027We have to make an example of someone. And again, he is the most obvious one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re saying that whoever did this, he can\u0027t be seen to get away with it entirely? Someone must pay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it will make no difference. We still won\u0027t know who did it, or how he got into the strong-room without tripping an alarm, and out again -and out of Le Manse - without anyone so much as seeing, hearing, or even smelling him!\u0027 Even Tony was beginning to show his agitation now.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I smelled him well enough!\u0027 Francesco shouted. \u0027Tear-gas! In the ventilation! And grenades, in the vault!\\n\\n Uncounted - literally uncounted - billions in marks, lira, francs, dollars, and treasures, destroyed or stolen. From under our noses. At least a quarter of everything we held down there. And as if that weren\u0027t enough, he actually locked up before leaving! The impertinence of this bastard! Unbelievable!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Impertinent, yes,\u0027 his brother agreed, scowling. \u0027And we sit here impotent.\u0027\\n\\n Francesco ground his teeth, and repeated: \u0027We should have Cavee in again.\u0027\\n\\n Tony\u0027s shrug. \u0027He knows nothing. One look at his face says it all: why, he thinks he should be rewarded; he was that quick off the mark!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Rewarded!\u0027 Francesco snarled.\\n\\n \u0027And the cameras, ruined,\u0027 Tony slumped more yet. \u0027It was hot in there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not necessarily ruined,\u0027 Francesco answered. \u0027They think they can save one of them - or rather, its contents. We can at least hope that we have this dog on film!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We do have Cavee\u0027s description.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Francesco snorted. \u0027What, a true description? If he was in on it? And if he wasn\u0027t, what was that for a description anyway? A face and figure, seen distorted, in monochrome and at an angle from above?\u0027\\n\\n Tony stirred himself, stood up. \u0027You know, of course, that He has been crying out al this time? There was gas down there, too.\\n\\n And he is, after all, our greatest \"treasure.\" For without him, where would we be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard him, yes,\u0027 Francesco rumbled. \u0027But then, who could avoid hearing him? Raving, babbling about bloody Radu, at a time like this!\u0027 But he knew that it must have been worse for his brother, for Anthony and his father were closer. Then, in a moment, Francesco\u0027s expression changed. And turning to face the other, his eyes narrowed more yet and became red-burning slits in his dark face.\\n\\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 said Tony, wonderingly.\\n\\n \u0027We have to make an example of someone,\u0027 Francesco growled. \u0027We can\u0027t be seen to be ... impotent, as you put it.\\n\\n Our dear father is ever hungry. And if Guy Cavee has knowledge of this thing ... \"\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s a lieutenant,\u0027 Tony pointed out. \u0027Junior, but - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he is our example!\u0027 Francesco cut him off, grinning darkly. \u0027Our important example. We can always promote another junior lieutenant, but we shall never be able to make a better example - of anyone.\u0027\\n\\n Again Tony\u0027s shrug. \u0027Well, at least it\u0027s a course of action,\u0027 he said. \u0027Certainly we need to do something. But I can\u0027t see that it will produce anything of a solution. However, and since you seem determined ...\u0027 Grudgingly, he nodded his head. \u0027So be it...\u0027\\n\\n By 11:30 the Necroscope was cycling through wild and gorgeous country somewhere west of Edinburgh. He wore his track-suit; a pack on his shoulders contained a pair of decent climbing shoes and some spare items of clothing; he supposed B.J. would see to anything else. Himself: Harry had already seen to something and got himself some expert tuition; or he\u0027d arranged access to it, at least.\\n\\n Not wanting to make a total fool of himself in the hills, this morning he\u0027d spoken to the dead in a Bonnyrig cemetery and got some leads. The man he had been looking for was in a graveyard in Dalkeith. Harry had gone there along the Mobius way and introduced himself in his fashion; when the excitement had died down, he\u0027d explained his reason for being there. Now he felt a lot happier that he could look after himself on a cliff face.\\n\\n The dead man he\u0027d spoken to had been a climber of the old school. Not a mountaineer as such, no, but someone who had made himself something of a local legend in his lifetime, as a rock-climbing man without peer. No nylon ropes in they days, Necryscope, he\u0027d told Harry. And I wouldn\u0027ae be caught dead - ye\u0027ll excuse mah language - with hammer and piton in mah hand! Lord, no! All that cock wiz fer the so-called \u0027professionals.\u0027 Ah wiz no professional - but man, ah could monkey up a sheer slab o\u0027 a rock like a wee lizard! Lookin\u0027 back now, all eighty years and more - ah can\u0027t say, ah don\u0027t know - ah think it wiz the view pure and simple. Toe look doon on the world frae on high, frae a new place, ye ken, and ken that only the eagles had ever perched there afore a man? Ah, that wiz something!\\n\\n \u0027Will be again,\u0027 Harry had told him from his seat on the old lad\u0027s sarcophagus in the shade of a tree, breathing in the cool, calming quiet of the cemetery. \u0027You can see it all again, through my eyes; though I can\u0027t promise you the climb is going to excite you. I\u0027m only a beginner. I don\u0027t suppose my guide will be letting me tackle anything too adventurous.\u0027\\n\\n A beginner, is it? Wel, ye\u0027re in good hands, be sure, I wouldn\u0027ae dare let anything happen to ye! The dead man had assured him. Me. but ah traveled tae do mah climbing, Harry. Ben Nevis, the Peak District, North Wales, Derbyshire, the Dartmoor Tors, the Cornish and Pembrokeshire sea cliffs ... you name it! But a wee climb will be beter than none at al! Just gi\u0027 me a cal, and ah\u0027l be there fer ye. And don\u0027t fret none ... ah\u0027l no be letting ye down, Necryscope. No wi\u0027 a bump, anyhow!\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027See, this lady I\u0027ll be climbing with is good at it. I don\u0027t want to be made to look, you know, stupid, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n Eh? A wee lassie, is it? Aye, well there were a few good ones in mah day, too. Ah mind one who ... oh, it\u0027s a long time ago. But she wiz the only one who ever beat me up a crag, ah\u0027ll tell ye that...!\\n\\n And shortly it had been time to go.\\n\\n It was only after the Necroscope had left that his new friend recalled the name of the girl from his time, eighty years ago, who had\\n\\n \u0027beaten him up a crag.\u0027 Then, he\u0027d thought to call out after the Necroscope, but Harry\u0027s Ma had got to him first: Don\u0027t, she told him. My son ... is in trouble. But we have it under control. We think so, anyway. The thing is, if he were to hear that girl\u0027s name ... we really don\u0027t know what it would do to his mind. So let it be for now. There will be time later, if it comes to it...\\n\\n The old climber had asked no questions. Like most of the Great Majority, he\u0027d heard of Mary Keogh and knew her reputation; that whatever she did on Harry\u0027s behalf would be for the best. But he really couldn\u0027t understand her concern. Why, that young lassie he\u0027d remembered, that Bonnie Jean Mirlu, would be a long time down in the ground herself by now! What, after all these long years? Of course she would.\\n\\n But because Mary Keogh had spoken, these were thoughts he would keep to himself, always ...\\n\\n The Necroscope had long since mastered the technique of vacating the Continuum astride his machine: it was just a matter of balance, of going from metaphysical to physical, weightlessness to gravity, darkness to light - \u0027simple\u0027\\n\\n things, to Harry. But he still had his other thing - about someone seeing him in the moment he emerged into this space-time. He had become that concerned with keeping his esoteric talents secret.\\n\\n On this occasion, though (and oddly enough, because he was riding a bike), he didn\u0027t worry. For it\u0027s one thing for a man to suddenly appear out of nowhere, but quite another for a man on a bicycle to spring into existence. For a bicycle is such a mundane thing that if a man on a bike comes from nowhere, then it\u0027s a trick of the light, or the eye, or the mind. But it certainly can\u0027t be weird or supernatural.\\n\\n Thus in only ten minutes Harry was able to cover the distance from his house on the outskirts of Bonnyrig to his rendezvous with Bonnie Jean at a pub on the approaches to Falkirk, by \u0027jumping\u0027 stretches of the road ahead for distances of anything from a hundred yards to half a mile. If he could see the way was clear ahead - see with his own eyes the place where he would like to emerge - it was as good as a co-ordinate, and he could simply \u0027go\u0027 there.\\n\\n Finally the picturesque little pub was in view; he spied the place from the crest of a low hill, jumped to a paved service track at the rear, and emerged as from an avenue of tall, fully-clad chestnut trees that made for a perfectly concealed \u0027landing.\u0027 A moment more and he had cycled round to the front of the place, parked his machine and entered.\\n\\n Bonnie Jean was seated at a table in an alcove at one end of the bar. A shame, because it was gloomy; she could have chosen a window seat; but in any case the day was overcast. Maybe she wouldn\u0027t want to climb after all. But no such luck.\\n\\n He slid into his seat beside her, said, \u0027Hello,\u0027 and: \u0027It doesn\u0027t look any too hot out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s ideal.\u0027 She gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u0027We won\u0027t have the sun in our eyes.\u0027 He couldn\u0027t know that she had been keeping abreast of the weather forecasts and so had been fully aware that there\u0027d be little or no sun from noon today.\\n\\n They talked, about nothing much in particular, ate a light lunch, and Harry paid the bill. \u0027A man of means,\u0027 B.J.\\n\\n commented.\\n\\n \u0027Er, you could say that,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I\u0027m solvent again, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n She pulled a wry face. \u0027I wish I could say the same. That place of mine scarcely pays for itself. In fact, I\u0027m in debt.\u0027 Then she bit her lip, for she hadn\u0027t meant to tell him that.\\n\\n \u0027How much?\u0027 he asked her.\\n\\n Too much,\u0027 she told him. Three and a half thousand too much!\u0027 And she sighed and shrugged. \u0027It might mean becoming a pub instead of a club after all.\u0027\\n\\n Harry felt sorry for her, said, \u0027Oh, you never know. Something could turn up.\u0027 In a way he felt guilty; for she\u0027d been spending quite a lot of her time, her nights, with him. Well, he certainly had the means to put that right...\\n\\n The climb B.J. had chosen was further than she had thought; it was some time since she\u0027d been out this way, and never by car. Something like sixty years since the last time she\u0027d practised her climbing here ... but the scenery hadn\u0027t changed that much. The place, in the sprawling foothills of Ben Vorlich, was dramatically beautiful: Loch Lubnaig gleamed silver-grey under the low, unseasonal cloud ceiling, and Ben Ledi across the loch was a hazy blue silhouette like a squat mushroom - the bulk of the mountain holding aloft a massive grey cap formed of dirty sky.\\n\\n \u0027Shoes,\u0027 B.J. commented, eyeing Harry\u0027s feet as they made their way diagonally across sliding scree to the foot of a jagged rock outcrop that rose almost sheer for a hundred feet, to a saddle between awesomely carved spurs. \u0027Boots were better - climbing boots - but as you can see, I don\u0027t wear them either. Anyway, it\u0027s the soles that count. Good, gritty rubber to grip the rock. Boots do protect the ankles, though. You\u0027ll remember, if you get a sprain.\u0027\\n\\n Thanks,\u0027 Harry told her. Til try not to.\u0027 But, as they arrived below the crag: \u0027Are we climbing this?\u0027\\n\\n B.J. grinned at him. \u0027For starters,\u0027 she said. \u0027But don\u0027t worry - this time next year, this will be like a Sunday afternoon stroll! And anyway, I\u0027ll have you on a rope - this time. So for now, why don\u0027t you just sit there and watch while I get the gear ready? I\u0027ll be a minute or two, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n She shrugged out of her pack, turned her back on him, and went down on one knee.\\n\\n Harry wandered off around the base of a chimney that rose half-way to the summit. Out of sight of B.J., he spoke to his friend in the cemetery in Dalkeith. How about it?\\n\\n The other looked out through his eyes, answered: Damn me, but ah\u0027ve climbed here before! Ben Vorlich, am I right?\\n\\n Absolutely.\\n\\n Well, are ye ready?\\n\\n Harry peeped around the base of the stack. B.J. was still busy with her pack, her back still turned to him. Yes, why not?\\n\\n Off we go then. A piece o\u0027 cake. Just you leave it toe me, Necryscope.\\n\\n And the Necroscope left it to him - but not entirely. He felt what the dead climber felt, every nuance of the climb.\\n\\n And of course he learned as they went; for it was his arms and muscles taking the strain, easing him up, ever up within the cleft of the chimney; his eyes scanning the way ahead, taking in each and every detail of the route; his brain, recording it all for later. And the old-timer\u0027s narrative to guide him all the way;\\n\\n That crack there - a good wee hand hold, three fingers at least. And that split opposite: ye can getye\u0027re toe in there - but mind ye dinnae twist ye\u0027re foot! and that wee ledge, Necryscope: aye, park ye\u0027re arse right there a moment... but on\u0027y a moment! And alwiz keep moving - on and up! And breathe, laddie, breathe! For it\u0027s the air that powers ye. Breathe easy, Harry, in and oot. Ah! And see there: a piton! But dinnae ye touch it! That\u0027s cheatin\u0027!\\n\\n They were through the chimney and onto the outer face, and Harry felt like he was actually haring for the high horizon of the topmost rim. Then he scuffed loose a pebble that went clattering all the way down the sheer face, until it hit the scree and bounced up between B.J.\u0027s legs, where she\u0027d just that instant straightened up from her pack. Laden with a rope, hammer, pitons, she frowned, turned, saw a trickle of dust from above. And she looked up.\\n\\n Then ... she would have called out - in astonishment if for no other reason - but was afraid to do so in case she distracted him. The idiot!\\n\\n But \u0027the idiot\u0027 was hauling himself up onto the rim, to sit there with his legs dangling, waving down at her! And B.J.\\n\\n too sat down, with a bump, on the scree, stared up at Harry and for the first time in as long as she could remember felt dizzy - from the angle of her neck, and from the thought of Harry\u0027s \u0027solo\u0027 climb: the speed of it!\\n\\n Then anger replaced her astonishment. The clever bastard! Letting her think he was new to all this!\\n\\n Quickly, she shed her gear, grabbed her pack, set off back the way they had come. Thus she failed to see Harry reeling on the rim, and almost falling before he could regain his balance. Except it wasn\u0027t him but his guide: the fact that the old climber\u0027s mind had seemed suddenly to go blank, so that the Necroscope had been left alone, as it were, on a knife-edge of vertiginous rock.\\n\\n Following which ...\\n\\n ... The way down took a deal longer, and Harry could feel something of a tremble in his guide\u0027s suddenly uncertain mind. At the bottom he asked him: \u0027What was all that about?\u0027\\n\\n A sick spell, the other lied. That\u0027s what stopped me frae climbing, Necryscope: dizzy sickness. Er, vertigo? Aye, and it got me in the end, sure enough. Ah got dizzy once too often ...\\n\\n \u0027You fell?\u0027 Harry\u0027s jaw fell open. He couldn\u0027t believe it.\\n\\n So ah did. But it\u0027s how ah lived; ah cannae complain it\u0027s how ah died, too.\\n\\n And Harry sighed deeply, closed his eyes and thought: Now he tells me! But he kept the thought to himself.\\n\\n Likewise his guide. He, too, kept his thoughts to himself. The fact that he now knew something of what Harry\u0027s Ma had been talking about. For in fact his \u0027attack\u0027 had come when Harry had looked down at Bonnie Jean. The old climber had seen her, too - through the Necroscope\u0027s eyes - that lass who eighty years ago had beaten him up a crag!\\n\\n Well, and finally he\u0027d got his own back ...\\n\\n By the time Harry reached the car, B.J. had almost, not quite, forgiven him. Her tone was severe as she told him: \u0027I\u0027ve a mind to make you cycle home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got it all wrong,\u0027 he lied, but in a way told the precise truth. \u0027I\u0027ve never done it before. It just seemed - I don\u0027t know - so natural, that\u0027s all. Sort of instinctive?\u0027\\n\\n And by the time she\u0027d got him home she was half-convinced.\\n\\n They made love through the evening, but as night came on she had to go. \u0027I\u0027ve missed too many Saturday nights,\u0027\\n\\n she explained. \u0027My regulars expect to see me behind the bar.\u0027\\n\\n But as she kissed him and got into the car, Harry pressed a velvet gift sacklet into her hand. \u0027Oh?\u0027 B.J. looked at him curiously, surprised at the weight of his present.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s very practical,\u0027 he told her. \u0027A little something I feel sure you can use.\u0027\\n\\n And it was. In her room above B.J.\u0027s, she untied the ribbon and turned out the contents onto her bedspread: twenty golden Kruger-rands. B.J. knew their value! Her mysterious Mr Keogh certainly seemed\" to have got his finances sorted out - not to mention hers ...\\n\\n At Le Manse Madonie, the \u0027cleansing\u0027 of Guy Cavee\u0027s person had taken all day. He\u0027d been kept fully conscious most of the time - a torture in itself; the Spanish Inquisition could scarcely have been more cruel - and like the Inquisition, at each stage of the process he\u0027d been given the opportunity to confess. If he had been able to tell the Francezcis anything, certainly he would have done so. And in the end he did: let them so much as make a suggestion - he agreed with it. So that even then they couldn\u0027t be sure he was entirely innocent.\\n\\n But they knew how to make sure. In the moment of his absorption into Angelo, the truth would be known. After that\\n\\n ... his mind, or what was left of a mind, would be mainly his own again. But his body -well, there would be no body.\\n\\n Angelo\u0027s digestive system was that of the Wamphyri carried by his rampant metamorphism to its absolute limits.\\n\\n Literally absorption: he would not so much \u0027digest\u0027 the ex-lieutenant as render him liquid, suck him up like a sponge, add his mass to the bulk of the unthinkable abnormality that was Angelo Francezci, Ferenczini, Ferenczy. A process of simultaneous internal and external homogeniza-tion: to make Cavee as one with the active body, the substance, of the pit-thing. The utter and utterly destructive rape and reduction of a person to protoplasm of... of a different nature.\\n\\n But the mind, thoughts, memories, would be there, not alive but incorporated into Angelo\u0027s mentality, giving him something of access, as to a piece of unfeeling computer software. Incorporeal, and therefore unfeeling, yes, but not without emotion and not without memories. Guy Cavee, like all the others before him, would know exactly what was become of him.\\n\\n As for the thing in the pit: Angelo had been \u0027silent\u0027 for hours; even Tony Francezci had heard or sensed nothing of his father since midday. It was possible that the intruder\u0027s tear-gas had entered the Thing\u0027s system, rendering him ill or even unconscious. But his metamorphism -which was all he was now, a metamorphism - would have no trouble dealing with that; and his mist, his miasma, rose up from the pit as before.\\n\\n Tony had tried \u0027speaking\u0027 to him, told him what had happened and what he and his brother were doing about it; hoping to bring him round, he had even asked for his advice in the matter - all to no avail. But as the brothers had had the now unconscious Cavee placed on the crane\u0027s platform and swung out over the open pit, Tony had felt a psychic tingle of expectancy and had sensed an incredible hunger; so that he\u0027d known his father was silent for his own reasons.\\n\\n Therefore, before bringing Cavee awake with an ampule and lowering him into the shaft, Tony had tried one last time:\\n\\n \u0027Father, we need to know if this man is a traitor. We need to know who coerced him, turned him against us, against you. I know you are hungry, but if he is a dupe we need his thoughts. We need the names in his head.\u0027\\n\\n Nothing - only the miasma thickening - as the brothers, and their lieutenants and senior thrals, edged back from the mouth of the pit. And then Francesco, ever impatient, stepped forward and broke an ampule under Cavee\u0027s nose, commiting him to hel.\\n\\n The platform descended; the miasma rose thicker yet; Cavee began screaming as he came awake to his worst nightmare. He was tied down; his screams, denials, confessions, pitiful pleading, couldn\u0027t help him -nothing could. Then the choking, coughing, gurgling, and the soggy splitting sound ... like meat wrenched from a bone, or wet leather tearing; and in a little while the mist rising from the mouth of the pit turning pink. Then: AN INNOCENT, their father\u0027s doom-fraught voice rang in the brothers\u0027 minds. MORE INNOCENT THAN THEM WHO LEFT ME DOWN HERE TO CRY\\n\\n OUT, NOT KNOWING THE WHYS OR WHEREFORES OF IT! THE SAME ONES WHO NOW BEG ME FOR MY HELP! ... HAH! BUT YOU MERELY\\n\\n SEEK ANSWERS, WHILE I ALREADY HAVE THEM ...!\\n\\n Tony waited awhile, then said: \u0027Father, what threatens us threatens you. We need to know, else we can do nothing.\u0027\\n\\n AH, ANTHONY, MY ANTHONY! AND FRANCESCO; I SEE THAT YOU ARE HERE, TOO. BUT DID YOU NOT\\n\\n HEAR ME CALLING OUT TO YOU? I CALLED FOR LONG AND LONG. AND DID YOU NOT HEAR THE NAME THAT I CALLED?\\n\\n The brothers glanced at each other, and Francesco finally grunted and said, That again: Radu, Radu, Radu! But he\u0027s long gone to earth and won\u0027t be up for a while, if ever. What has he to do with anything?\u0027\\n\\n OH YOU FOOL! said that awful Voice\u0027 from the pit, quietly but scornfully. WHY, UPON A TIME YOU BROUGHT ME\\n\\n ONE OF HIS -A GIRL - TO QUESTION HER. I LEARNED A LITTLE; NOT MUCH, BECAUSE UNLIKE MY THRALLS, RADU\u0027S THRALLS ARE STRONG. SHE WAS BEGUILED; HER MIND WAS CLOSED; SHE COULDN\u0027T SPEAK. BUT\\n\\n SHE WAS ONE OF HIS ... AND YOU TOOK HER!\\n\\n \u0027Because you pressured us into believing that when he was up again he\u0027d come looking for us!\u0027 Francesco snarled, displaying his objection to being called a thrall. \u0027Because you fear this dog-Lord bastard, and transferred your fear to us!\u0027\\n\\n And after a moment\u0027s silence: FEAR HIM? WHY, I FEAR EVERYTHING! TRAPPED DOWN HERE AS I AM, I AM\\n\\n VULNERABLE! EVEN MY OWN SONS HAVE POWER OVER ME. BUT NOW THERE\u0027S ONE WHO MAY WELL HAVE\\n\\n POWER OVER ALL OF US.\\n\\n \u0027His name?\u0027 Tony was eager now.\\n\\n AYE, I SAW THAT, IN HIS MIND. IT WAS ... IT WAS HARRY!\\n\\n \u0027And is he invisible, this \"Harry?\" \u0027 Francesco snorted his sarcasm.\\n\\n APPARENTLY - OR NOT APPARENTLY! The Thing had its sense of humour.\\n\\n \u0027And his master, the people he works for?\u0027 (From Tony.)\\n\\n HOW CAN YOU BE MY SONS, AND DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND, TOO?\\n\\n Again the brothers glanced at each other. And: \u0027Are you saying - \u0027 Tony began, only to be cut off at once by a howl of rage, frustration:\\n\\n HE STRIKES BACK, EVEN FROM HIS LONG SLEEP! YOUR INTRUDER WAS NO COMMON MAN - WHAT, BUT HE SPEAKS\\n\\n TO THE DEAD! - AND HE WORKS FOR NO COMMON MASTER. YOU TOOK ONE OF HIS, AND THIS WAS HIS REVENGE ... OR PART OF IT.\\n\\n Angelo was mistaken, in part at least, but his logic was perfectly sound.\\n\\n \u0027Radu?\u0027 And now there was a tremor in Tony\u0027s voice.\\n\\n THE SAME, his father answered. HE FLEXES WASTED MUSCLES, AND TESTS OUR METAL IN ADVANCE OF HIS RETURN. AND HE HAS\\n\\n FOUND IT WEAK!\\n\\n Tony grabbed Francesco\u0027s arm. \u0027I think he\u0027s right. I know that he believes it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need proof!\u0027 the other snarled. \u0027Oh, I know we can move on our father\u0027s word, bring about mayhem in England or wherever, perhaps track this Radu to his lair and destroy him there - and perhaps expose ourselves, too! Not to any old vampire Lord, but to the authorities! What, centuries of secrecy wasted? Ah, and how many of our good friends across the world would \"flock\" to our assistance then, do you suppose? No, before I make another move, I need proof.\u0027\\n\\n I, I, I. It was always T with Francesco and never \u0027we.\u0027 Tony narrowed his eyes. But before he could answer, there came a shout from the stairwel:\\n\\n \u0027Francesco, Anthony! Sir, and sir!\u0027 A man in a white smock waved something excitedly. \u0027Photographs! The intruder! We have him on film!\u0027\\n\\n And: \u0027Proof?\u0027 Tony said, his red eyes lighting like lamps. \u0027Wel, perhaps now we have it!\u0027\\n\\n And behind them as they left the place, the ancient thing in the pit thought: IT BEGINS! - then relapsed into gibbering and darkness ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-26.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \\n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
