{"id":80360,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"III\n HOME WITH BONNIE JEAN\n And: Sergeant, said Harry to a good friend of his, well over a hundred miles away in the cemetery in Harden, / believe I have a problem. His dead friend, an ex-Army physical training instructor, and an extremely hard man in his time, was into Harry\u0027s mind at once, looking out through his eyes and reading the picture he saw in the bar room. The thing is, Harry went on, while Sergeant got acquainted, / don\u0027t want too much mess.\n Step away from the bar, Harry, \u0027Sergeant\u0027 Graham Lane told him. This lad\u0027s big and bold, but he\u0027s getting old. What, forty-five?\n And look at his gut: he drinks too much, and he\u0027s had too much tonight, too. The next time he speaks to you, if he really means to have a go, is when he\u0027ll make his move. Let me take it from there ...\n Harry moved away from the bar into open space, heard B.J. saying: \u0027Look, Big Jimmy, we were only talking. I\u0027ve the right to talk to people in mah own place, have I no\u0027?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the way he was lookin\u0027 at ye, lass,\u0027 Big Jimmy answered, speaking to her but narrowing his eyes at Harry. \u0027I just dinnae like his attitude, his flashy answers!\u0027 (Here it came):\n \u0027You!\u0027 Big Jimmy rasped, turning more fully to Harry. \u0027So ye\u0027re a live one, eh?\u0027 And he started his swing. \u0027Well, not for long, ye fucking pipsqueak!\u0027\n Sergeant was right there in the Necroscope\u0027s mind, directing him, almost controlling him. So Harry let him handle it his way.\n The bar was on Harry\u0027s right, and Big Jimmy moving along it from the left, still knocking aside bar stools. The man had swung with his right hand, a lumbering blow with lots of weight but nothing of speed. The Necroscope stepped forward inside the arc of the fist, caught Big Jimmy\u0027s wrist in both hands, turned and bent forward from the waist. The big man\u0027s impetus carried him forward; Harry\u0027s back formed the fulcrum and his opponent\u0027s arm the lever; he rose up, somersaulted, came crashing down on a table and reduced it to rubble. And Harry said:\n Christ, Sergeant! I said no mess!\n What mess? The other answered. Ifs over! He\u0027s winded but that\u0027s all. And maybe he\u0027ll take it as a warning. Only a total moron would push it any further. He\u0027s seen how fast we are.\n Wel, I hope you\u0027re right, Harry answered with feeling, as Big Jimmy got groggily to his feet.\n \u0027Why, ye - \u0027 The man took a stumbling step forward.\n The Necroscope took a pace back, his arms lifting and extending forward as his hands commenced moving in an unmistakable karate weave. And cocking his head slightly on one side, warningly: \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 he said. Simply that.\n \u0027Huh!\u0027 The other grunted, stopping dead in his tracks. \u0027So ye\u0027re a hard man, are ye?\u0027\n \u0027You really don\u0027t want to find out,\u0027 Harry told him.\n And from behind the bar: \u0027Ye\u0027re leaving, Big Jimmy!\u0027 B.J. snapped. \u0027Right now, an\u0027 ye\u0027re no coming back!\u0027\n Big Jimmy looked at her through litle red pig-eyes, cast one more murderous glance at Harry, and grunted, Tuck ye\u0027all, then!\u0027 As he swung around and headed for the door, one of the girls was hot on his heels with his coat; and B.J. shouting after them:\n \u0027Tear up his card! No one\u0027s ever tae let that pig in here again!\u0027 Her eyes stopped blazing and she looked at Harry, who was finishing his drink. And regaining a semblance of control, B.J. said: \u0027Greased lightning, aye. Maybe ye\u0027re right, and I should\u0027nae have tae do with ye.\u0027\n Too late for that, B.J.\u0027 he told her. \u0027We\u0027re already had \"tae do,\" as you wel know.\u0027 He glanced round the room but no one was looking his way. They probably thought it best not to. One of the girls was clearing away the wrecked table. \u0027We have to talk,\u0027 Harry reminded B.J.\n She pursed her lips, as if preparing to argue, but finaly said, Tonight, then, after we\u0027ve closed. Midnight, right here. And now perhaps ye\u002711 go? Ye\u0027re no\u0027 a member, after al. Ah\u0027ve mah licence tae think about.\u0027\n And you should think a little more about your accent, he thought, which changes like the wind round Edinburgh Castle!\n B.J. signalled for one of her girls to get his coat, then phoned for a taxi: \u0027Just in case the Big Man\u0027s waiting outside for ye ...\u0027 But he wasn\u0027t, and neither was the little man with the camera. Harry didn\u0027t need the taxi but took it anyway -as far as the town centre. .Then he took the Mobius route the rest of the way to Bonnyrig.\n Back home he rummaged around until he found an incredibly ancient bottle of Scottish malt whisky that must have belonged to his stepfather. There was stil an inch or two of liquor in the bottom, and as he poured himself a large shot he couldn\u0027t help but wonder what Alec Kyle would have thought of it. Oddly enough, he stil felt buoyed by the single shot of cognac he\u0027d had at B.J.\u0027s! So what was he to make of that? A warning?\n And: I\u0027ve really got to get this body in training, Harry thought. With which he poured the contents of his glass - and the rest of the botle -away down the kitchen sink. Once you know your enemy, it\u0027s easier to deal with him.\n And that was the end of that...\n But maybe he should have taken a drink if only to lighten up a little. Doom and gloom were back by the time he used the Mobius Continuum to return to B.J.\u0027s, a little after midnight, and the miseries were on Harry as heavy as ever. Also, he was somewhat upset by al this unnecessary hopping about; if B.J. had realy wanted to talk to him, why hadn\u0027t she simply taken him into her back room and talked to him? Or ... had she needed the time to set him up?\n Whichever, he was alert as never before as he stepped out of the Continuum across the street from B.J.\u0027s in the dark doorway where he\u0027d seen the little man with the camera. If anything he was early; two of B.J.\u0027s girls were just geting into a taxi at the kerbside, and B.J. herself was seeing them off. She gave a wave from her doorway as the cab puled away, then moved back out of sight. And the iluminated sign blinked into darkness.\n Harry conjured a door of his own, moved across the street, rang B.J.\u0027s bel. She hadn\u0027t had time to lock the door yet; he sensed movement, heard the ratle of a chain; the door swung open.\n And seeing him: \u0027Now how in al that\u0027s ...?\u0027 she said, and frowned her puzzlement. \u0027You weren\u0027t here just a moment ago. I thought you weren\u0027t coming.\u0027\n He shrugged. \u0027I saw your girls leaving and waited. Didn\u0027t want anyone to get the, er, wrong idea.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, realy?\u0027 she raised an eyebrow. \u0027Wel, maybe ye\u0027d beter come in then, before someone sees you!\u0027 And as he made to step across the threshold, \u0027But Harry, you can believe me that they wouldn\u0027t get the wrong idea. So let\u0027s have it understood: this is strictly business. It\u0027s not that I want you here, but that you want to be here, right?\u0027\n His turn to frown, where he paused with one foot over the threshold. \u0027You invited me.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she denied it. \u0027You insisted!\u0027\n \u0027Wel, I\u0027m here anyway,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027And do you stil want to talk to me?\u0027 (She half blocked his way).\n \u0027If you\u0027l let me in, yes!\u0027\n Smiling, she let him pass. And walking along the corridor while she finished locking the door, he wondered, now what was that al about?\n The lights were low in the bar room; Harry stood waiting, until B.J. came in from the corridor and turned them off altogether. Then he stood in total darkness, until a vertical crack of light expanded into an oblong as B.J. opened a recessed door behind the bar and passed through into the back room. And looking back at him, she said: \u0027Well, are ye no\u0027 coming?\u0027 She was in and out of that accent of hers like a hungry budgie in its cage, hopping to and fro from swing to swing!\n Harry let himself through the bar hatch and followed her into the back room, or one of them. It was a storage room with a door to one side and stairs ascending to B.J.\u0027s private rooms overhead. Here the Necroscope hesitated . . . until from the foot of the stairs B.J. said: \u0027I see more than enough of that bar of an evening. So if we must talk, let\u0027s at least be comfortable.\u0027\n Following her up the lighted stairs, he admired her figure and the natural swing of her backside in her sheath skirt, which was slit up one side oriental style. B.J. was slim and shapely . . . and classy, yes. Or was it just Kyle\u0027s body chemistry? Whichever, the Necroscope felt it; also their closeness: the fact that they were quite alone here. But (he was quick to reassure himself) it was all part of the search for Brenda.\n This is where I live,\u0027 she told him, stepping aside on a landing that opened directly into her living room. \u0027Go on in.\u0027 And as he stepped by her into the room: \u0027Do have a seat, Harry Keogh,\u0027 she said.\n Before doing so he looked the room over, and was pleased with what he saw. For where the bar below was a mixture of different styles, this room was all B.J. - it perfectly reflected her image, or the image that he still had of her. It was tasteful, yet exciting, too.\n It pleased the eye, and simultaneously satisfied the mind. Lacking pretension or ostentation, still it looked rich, looked real. . . like the woman herself?\n The carpet was pile, patterned, and obviously wool. Harry could almost feel its warmth coming right through the soles of his shoes. The carpet\u0027s pattern was ... what, Turkish? Greek? But Mediterranean, anyway. As were the varnished pine ceiling beams that formed spokes from the centre of the ceiling, completing the wheel where they were joined up by curving members around the room\u0027s perimeter. Thus the room had a circular or at least octagonal look, while in fact it was simply a square room. But actually there was nothing \u0027simple\u0027 about it.\n The main lighting feature, a small round chandelier on an extending golden chain, depended from the hub of the pine ceiling-wheel; its crystal pendants served to contain the electric light from three egg-shaped bulbs, so that the whole piece was set glowing like a small soft sun. Its light was adequate, but could be supplemented by use of shaded wall lights, and by the reading lamp on its tall white stand near the circular central table.\n The three inner walls were decorated with what looked like good quality old prints in modern frames, while in the comers narrow tapestry screens framed in bamboo added to the circular effect. In the exterior wall, a wide bay window and seat took up three-quarters of the\n space and opened onto a balcony overlooking the garden; the Necroscope could see the gently mobile tops of trees or shrubbery out there, gleaming a lush green in the rain, and a night-dark hill in the distance (the Castle\u0027s Rock, maybe, or Arthur\u0027s Seat?) silhouetted against a lowering sky.\n A light-tan leather lounger faced two matching easy chairs across the polished top of the pine table, and a pair of tall, narrow, crammed bookshelves filled the gaps between the framed prints along one wall. A television set at the foot of one of the screens that flanked the bay window could be viewed comfortably from the lounger, while a music centre on its stand occupied the space in front of the other screen. Behind all four of the screens small chests of drawers were barely visible; obviously Bonnie Jean kept her clutter in the drawers, well out of sight of visitors. She was one tidy lady.\n To complete the picture, there was a rotating drinks cabinet on the open landing itself, where B.J. had paused, presumably to prepare drinks, and to inquire: \u0027A Courvoisier?\u0027\n Harry almost replied in the affirmative, then remembered his vow against hard liquor and shook his head. \u0027Thanks, no.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 she said. \u0027And am I supposed to sit here drinking by mahself!\u0027\n \u0027Nothing hard,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I\u0027m not one for hard liquor. Tonight was a one-off. If you hadn\u0027t suggested cognac, I probably wouldn\u0027t have thought of it. But look, since B.J. \u0027s is a wine bar, why don\u0027t you offer me a glass of wine?\u0027\n That seemed to please her. \u0027Actually,\u0027 she said, \u0027I think I\u0027m glad ye\u0027re no\u0027 a drinker. Hard drink will make a fool of a man - like Big Jimmy, for instance. It\u0027ll put an idiot in your head and a braggart in your mouth, to think and speak for ye!\u0027\n The Necroscope was well able to appreciate that: the idea of other people in your head, speaking and acting for you. And it wasn\u0027t too far-fetched, either, except his people were anything but idiots and usually told the truth!\n \u0027As for the difference,\u0027 B.J. went on ...\n \u0027... Eh?\u0027 he felt obliged to cut in.\n \u0027Between a pub and a wine bar,\u0027 she smiled.\n \u0027Oh!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the licence,\u0027 she explained. \u0027A pub\u0027s hours are controlled, and its clients often aren\u0027t! But my wine bar\u0027s a club whose opening hours are satisfactory to me ... within the law, you understand, and with clients that I can pick and choose.\u0027\n \u0027Like Big Jimmy?\u0027 Harry sat on the lounger.\n \u0027It was Big Jimmy\u0027s first bad mistake,\u0027 she answered, \u0027and his last.\u0027\n \u0027You know,\u0027 Harry said, \u0027that was the first Jock \"Jimmy\" I ever met? I know everyone calls everyone Jimmy up here, but are there really that many Jameses?\u0027\n She laughed, and explained: \u0027It\u0027s like \"Johns\" in London. Or \"Bruces\" in Australia. If you don\u0027t know someone\u0027s name, you call him Jimmy, that\u0027s all. But Big Jimmy really was one.\u0027\n Harry grimaced, and agreed, \u0027He was one, all right!\u0027\n Til tell ye something, though,\u0027 she said, sitting in one of the easy chairs opposite him. \u0027You\u0027d best be careful how you use \"Jock.\" The Scots don\u0027t much care for it.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I can tell you know about them,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Despite that you\u0027re not one of them ...?\u0027\n B.J. turned her face away and busied herself pouring wine, generally hiding her momentary confusion.\n She had brought a silver tray bearing a crystal decanter, a bottle, and glasses, from the drinks cabinet. Now she poured a glass of red wine from the decanter and a glass of liebfraumilch from the bottle. Taking up the sweet white wine, she offered a toast: \u0027Here\u0027s to you, Harry Keogh.\u0027 And the accent had quite disappeared.\n Harry picked up his glass and looked at it. The glass was many-faceted; its contents were a light ruby red, but seemed misty. \u0027The red\u0027s for me?\u0027 he queried. \u0027But I thought red wine was supposed to give you a headache? What\u0027s this, the \"house\" wine?\u0027\n That headache stuffs a myth,\u0027 she told him. \u0027In fact I deliberately chose the red for you because it\u0027s not so strong.\n But it does have more than its share of sediment, which is why I decanted it. I managed to clear most of it. But if you don\u0027t like it...\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I can always make you a coffee, or something else of your choice?\u0027\n Harry took a sip. The taste wasn\u0027t unpleasant; there was a certain bite to it - a hint of resin, maybe? He took a stab at it. \u0027You seem taken by things Mediterranean.\u0027\n \u0027Aha!\u0027 she said. \u0027One minute an innocent, the next a connoisseur! But you\u0027re right: a friend brought a whole crate of it back from Greece for me. Probably very cheap local stuff, which might explain its quality, but...\u0027\n \u0027... It\u0027s okay,\u0027 Harry cut her short. \u0027It tastes fine. And I\u0027m grateful for your hospitality. But B.J., I do have to talk to you.\u0027\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she said. \u0027About that night?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Well good, because I want to talk to you, too.\u0027\n \u0027You probably saved my life,\u0027 Harry went on, \u0027and I\u0027m not forgetting that I owe you for that. But what you did was still a killing, if not downright murder! Also, you nailed the \"wolfman\" to his seat in that van, and so helped kill him, too. And you were very cool, calm and collected about the whole business - which worries me. I mean, it\u0027s not everyone who goes around shooting people with a crossbow, then shrugs it off like it\u0027s something that happens all the time ... \"\n She waited until she was sure he had finished, then said: \u0027You could have asked me all of these things that night, after you ... well, after I found myself in the alley . . . when I was off balance? Let\u0027s face it, Harry, if I have a case to answer, so do you. You said you weren\u0027t a policeman, so ... what were you doing there that night, eh? And then there\u0027s a really big question: namely, how did you get us out of there? I mean, I still can\u0027t believe that - \u0027\n \u0027 - Drugged,\u0027 the Necroscope lied. \u0027I drugged you.\u0027 (He\u0027d come prepared for this).\n \u0027What?\u0027 Her eyes has narrowed to slits, increasing their tilt, making her look more feral than ever. \u0027You . . . drugged me? How?\n When?\u0027 Disbelief was written plain on Bonnie Jean\u0027s face.\n \u0027When I took your arm: I squeezed your arm tightly, held you, but still you pulled away. The effort you exerted to free yourself concealed the fact that I\u0027d administered a drug from a small device in my hand. It had been meant for the people I was after, but I hadn\u0027t had an opportunity to use it.\u0027\n She let that sink in, and thought about it. And finally: \u0027That... all sounds a bit far-fetched,\u0027 she said. \u0027What, you got me out of there, unconscious, on your own?\u0027 But Harry saw that she was uncertain.\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t alone,\u0027 he went on. \u0027I had friends in the yard at the back of that place. And I switched the lights off, remember? That stopped the police for a little while. By the time they went inside, we\u0027d bundled you over the wall.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 She cocked her head on one side. \u0027And then you carried me across the road, in full view of anyone who just might happen to be looking, to the alley, where you waited for me to recover, right?\u0027 Her sarcasm didn\u0027t quite drip, but it brimmed, certainly.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry nodded, delighted that she herself had supplied the answer to his biggest problem. \u0027Exactly right. There was a lot of milling around; most of the police were inside, or gathered at the entrance ramp; their vehicles were all over the place, blocking the road. And there was the distraction of the blazing van, of course. Also, if we had been seen . . . well, the people I work for are powerful. And so you see it wasn\u0027t really difficult. The drug is quick-acting, and just as quick to disperse. After a few minutes you came out of it. You were a bit shaken but nothing serious. Surely you remember sitting down on the wet cobbles?\u0027\n B.J. looked very uncertain now; her eyes blinked rapidly as she attempted to absorb all of this. \u0027I was shaken up,\u0027 she finally said. \u0027I ... didn\u0027t know what to make of things, except that it seemed like some kind of magic. I went to my hotel and to bed. In the morning ... well, it was all like a dream! And I had no way to contact you or even to know who you were. And I still don\u0027t.\u0027\n She looked at him accusingly.\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t have helped you,\u0027 the Necroscope continued, and took another sip of wine. \u0027It didn\u0027t do me much good with my superiors, the people at the top. I should have left you at the garage to fend for yourself, and that way the police would have had a suspect for the killings. But ...\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027You had saved my life, and I felt obliged.\u0027\n \u0027So ... you\u0027re an agent, of sorts?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 (It wasn\u0027t too much of a lie. He had been one, at that time, anyway).\n \u0027Working ... for whom?\u0027\n \u0027People,\u0027 Harry shrugged again. \u0027When the police can\u0027t do something that needs doing - when the law defeats the lawful -then my people are there to help. Except they\u0027re not my people any more. I overstepped myself, with you.\u0027\n Her mouth fell open. \u0027You\u0027re out?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered. This is my last job: to find out why you were there, why you did what you did. Only answer a question or two, truthfully ... you\u0027ll be in the clear. And I shall have squared it with my people.\u0027\n They\u0027ll take you back?\u0027\n \u0027No, but that\u0027s okay. I have other things to do.\u0027 He sipped again at his wine, which was in fact excellent. It soothed a sore throat he hadn\u0027t even realized he had. And it was loosening not only his tongue but his mind, too, and making everything he\u0027d said seem reasonable - even to him!\n \u0027So ...\u0027 (she was still uncertain). \u0027After you\u0027d left me in that alley - \u0027. and that was something of a swift getaway, too, if I may say so! - where did you go? And how did you disappear so quickly?\u0027\n \u0027I went to my superiors and briefed them on what had occurred. They\u0027d been after that gang for a long time. As for getting away quickly: \\ there\u0027s a wicket gate in that warehouse door in the alley. I simply I stepped through it.\u0027 (Well, he\u0027d stepped through a kind of door, : anyway, if not a wicket gate).\n The frown was back on her face. \u0027I could swear that when I glanced away from you, then back again, you had simply ... I don\u0027t know, disappeared?\u0027\n That stuff I used on you,\u0027 he answered. \u0027It has illusory effects, but i they soon wear off. Also, it was very misty in the alley.\n Anyway, what ; are you suggesting? Where\u0027s the mystery? I get paid -1 used to get paid \u0027 - not to be seen, to arrive unannounced and depart without leaving a trace.\u0027 Suddenly Harry was slurring his words. Not a lot, but sufficient that he noticed it.\n \u0027So what with the mist and all, and your disorienta- i tion ...\u0027\n And there was B.J. refilling his glass. Had he emptied it that quickly? \u0027Now it\u0027s your turn,\u0027 he said, stifling a yawn.\n \u0027Is my company that boring?\u0027 B.J. smiled wonderingly. Or so he thought.\n Tired!\u0027 the Necroscope told her, feeling the weight of his leaden eyelids. Not surprising, really ... all the chasing about he\u0027d been doing ... and the drink ... and the big question mark still hanging like a sword over Brenda and Harry Jr: their whereabouts, their safety. He leaned to one side, propping himself up with one elbow on the lounger, and asked: \u0027Why were you there? Why the crossbow? Why did you kill that Skippy bloke, and try to kill the one in the wolf mask? Just for revenge? You said that they\u0027d put friends of yours in jeopardy.\u0027 (The word \u0027jeopardy\u0027 hadn\u0027t come out very well, but Harry continued anyway): \u0027Which was enough to make you track them down and kill them? Well, all I can say is, you must really care for your friends! Why not start by telling me about that?\u0027\n \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 she looked a little worried now, concerned for him.\n \u0027Me? I\u0027m fine!\u0027 But the glass tilted in his hand a little. That was okay, there wasn\u0027t much wine in the glass anyway.\n \u0027Look, be comfortable,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ve only just realized how wiped out you look! Here, let me fix that ...\u0027 And before he could complain even if he\u0027d wanted to, B.J. had placed a couple of pillows under his head. \u0027You have hollows under your eyes a cat could curl up and sleep in!\u0027 she said. But the way she said the word \u0027sleep\u0027 was like an invocation: he could actually feel his itchy eyelids closing, and was too tired to rub them open.\n \u0027Your ... turn ...\u0027 he said, lolling there -\n - And barely felt her hands touching his shoulders, turning him on his back, and easing his head onto the pilows. And: Damn it! he thought, as he passed out. And a moment or an aeon later, even more idiotically: / hope I didn\u0027t drop my glass!\n When she was satisfied that the Necroscope was well and truly under, taking her time and careful not to disturb him too much, B.J. unclenched his fingers from around the glass, removed the tray and wine and all back to the drinks cabinet, then returned to Harry and pulled down the crystal chandelier on its retractable cable and chain. His story hadn\u0027t been so wild after all. Not to someone like Bonnie Jean Mirlu, who had heard many wild stories and known many wild things in her long, long life. And what he\u0027d said about drugging her hadn\u0027t come as too much of a surprise either, except for the fact that she hadn\u0027t been able to work out what he\u0027d done to her at the time. But now? It was far easier to believe that than that he\u0027d somehow conveyed her in the blink of an eye from one place to another, without covering the space between! What, like some kind of Genie out of the Arabian Nights?\n Well, Bonnie Jean didn\u0027t believe in that sort of magic, but the \u0027magic\u0027 of secret agencies, like Mis 5 or 6, and mindbending drugs especially, these were things she could readily believe in. Yes, for she had experience of the latter!\n Indeed her red wine was a case - or a good many botles - in point. The recipe for that had been old when the sciences were young, and when dabblers had been caled alchemists. B.J. didn\u0027t know what the ingredients were, but she knew where they were cached and how to brew them up. And she knew something of their origins, too: the islands of the Greek Sea - the \u0027Mediterranean,\u0027 as it was now - and the Bulgarian Empire (later Romania, or Eflak, or Walachia). Oh yes, and even further afield; for certain of the ingredients had come from the Far East with the Hsiung-nu (later the Huns), in the form of precious balms and medicines.\n Certainly the wine had been known in Manchuria and Sinkiang, and to the esoteric Worm Wizards of the Takla Makan Desert, and much later to Arab alchemists in olden Irem, the City of Pillars. In the 14th Century it had been used by the Bulgars - who were good chemists and wine-makers both - and by the Serbians and the Otoman Turks, to ward off the Black Death itself which also had its source in the east. After that, its secrets had been lost to mankind in the reel and roil and turmoil of a troubled world. Lost to mankind, aye, but not to Bonnie Jean\u0027s Master, who remembered al things and told them to her in the hours when she was caled up to atend Him. For she was His watcher where He lay in state, the Guardian of His Place. And the hour of His caling would be soon now ...\n ... The howling in her mind, that would cal her back even from half-way across the world - the cry of the Great Wolf in His secret den -that throbbing throat that the wild Carpathians had known when the Danube was a trade route and Alaric of the Visigoths was yet to sack Rome ...\n Reluctantly, B.J. drew herself back from her mental wanderings in space and time. After al, these weren\u0027t her memories but those of her Master, and she was only privy to them through Him. But Bonnie Jean had watched over Him for two hundred years - like her mother before her, and hers before her - and was a zealous, even a jealous Guardian. And now someone was come who might, just might, threaten B.J., and in so doing threaten Him in His place.\n Well, threats weren\u0027t new. They were old as earth, as old as her Master\u0027s being here; indeed, some of them had come here with him! But the nature of the threat was something else. Aye, for there are threats and there are threats. Now she must discover what sort Harry was, and decide how best to deal with it.\n Kill him? Oh, that would be easy, so easy. She could have done it in the garage - she almost had done it - except she\u0027d thought he was a policeman, and knew that the police don\u0027t give up easily when one of their own is murdered.\n She could even do it now, this very minute ... Ah, but what would follow behind? What of these powerful friends of his, these men who could act when the law couldn\u0027t? And what was their interest in her? Was it just the way he said it was, or was there a lot more to it? No, killing him now would be stupid, dangerous. Especially if he had been sent here, as he alleged. Safer to find out about him -discover al there was to know -and then let her Master decide his fate.\n By now the wine would be right through his system. It was time to begin. Bonnie Jean propped Harry up with pilows until he was in the half-reclining position. She drew curtains across the bay windows, turned down the chandelier lights to a softly luminous glow, and gave the spiral flex a gentle twist that set the pendants slowly turning. Winding and unwinding, they sent a stroboscopic flicker through the finely sheathing membranes of the Necroscope\u0027s eyelids.\n And: \u0027My turn, aye,\u0027 she said softly, in a while. \u0027Or are you no longer interested? Don\u0027t you want to listen to me then, Harry Keogh?\u0027\n His eyelids flickered and B.J. smiled. Oh, he could hear that hypnotic voice of hers, al right, as in some especially vivid dream. \u0027No need to speak,\u0027 she told him. \u0027Simply nod, or shake your head, in answer to my questions. Do you understand?\u0027 B.J. couldn\u0027t know that this was a \u0027game\u0027 he\u0027d played before, and that therefore his resistance was weakened. Or should be.\n He nodded, but his eyelids continued to flutter a litle. \u0027Would you like to see?\u0027 B.J. wondered out loud. \u0027If so, then open your eyes. The light won\u0027t hurt you; indeed the crystals will help you see more clearly. They\u0027l help both of us to see much more clearly.\u0027\n The Necroscope opened his eyes, and Bonnie Jean was gratified to note that their pupils were dark pinpricks swimming on moist mirror irises.\n \u0027Now listen,\u0027 she said, ensuring that the soft spokes of light from the chandelier\u0027s pendants were wheeling directly across his eyes and forehead. \u0027I want you to listen carefully and answer truthfully. You do want to answer my questions, don\u0027t you?\u0027 Her voice was now magnetic, utterly irresistible.\n (A slight twitch of Harry\u0027s head: left and right, left and right. A shake? A denial? He must be stronger than she\u0027d suspected! But no, he\u0027d been asked a question and was only trying to answer it truthfully - just as she had demanded!) Then his Adam\u0027s apple wobbled, and he gurgled: \u0027Y-your ... t-turn ... \"\n Why, he was continuing their \u0027waking\u0027 conversation! A different reaction from anything she\u0027d ever known before. Oh, he was a strange one, al right, this one! But: \u0027My turn, yes,\u0027 she agreed. And why not? Why not satisfy his queries here and now? Then, whatever his fate would be later, for now at least he\u0027d be satisfied that she was innocent of any \u0027ulterior\u0027 motives in connection with the kilings in the garage. What she\u0027d told him at that time - that her motive was pre-emptive, defensive - had been a lie concocted on the spur of the moment.\n She had hoped to gain his sympathy by telling him that those people had threatened friends of hers. That way he\u0027d be more likely to see her as an instrument of his own revenge, which he had. And now was the ideal time, the perfect opportunity, to substantiate and reinforce his previous opinion.\n And so: \u0027My turn,\u0027 she said again. \u0027You want to question me, Harry? You want me to answer those questions you asked me before you fell asleep?\u0027\n (His slow, shuddering nod). And B.J. wondering, What sort of mind has this man, anyway? A determined one, certainly!\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 she went along with it. \u0027Except... I shall expect you to believe everything I tell you. And no matter what I tell you, or say to you, you will only remember that I\u0027m innocent of any crime. You\u0027ll only remember that I\u0027m innocent, and anything else that I require you to remember. And in that respect, and with that regard to myself, you will only act when I desire it. At such times as I require, you\u0027ll follow any instructions I may give you to the letter. You\u0027ll follow any instructions I give you ... to ... the ... letter! Is that understood?\u0027\n But his nod was tentative, trembling.\n \u0027If I\u0027m to trust you with the truth, you must trust me,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027Isn\u0027t it only fair?\n \u0027Y-yes,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 she said. \u0027Now pay attention, and let\u0027s try to have a normal conversation - except you will generally accept what I say. But you are allowed to point out any holes in the logic of my answers. So ... can we try to talk normally?\u0027\n Harry\u0027s throat worked up and down as he licked his lips. His face relaxed a little, and he said, \u0027Sure, why not?\u0027 in a perfectly ordinary speaking voice ... but his pinprick pupils remained fixed unblinkingly on the slowly mobile pendants.\n B.J. was frankly astonished: at one and the same time he was difficult and he was easy! Perhaps, when these \u0027people\u0027 of his had trained him, they had somehow strengthened him against hypnotic suggestion. And post-hypnotic suggestion? If so, then he was a dead man. He mustn\u0027t be allowed to take any knowledge out of this room except what she desired him to know. But that was for the future, while for now:\n \u0027All right, then let\u0027s take it question by question,\u0027 she suggested. \u0027You wanted to know about my crossbow?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a weird weapon,\u0027 he said, attempting a shrug.\n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t,\u0027 she shook her head, despite that he wasn\u0027t looking at her. \u0027It\u0027s a perfectly normal weapon which I use to hunt rabbits in the Highlands. I climb, hunt, and live off the land; those are my hobbies. But I know a crossbow\u0027s power, and that it will kill men as well as rabbits. Also, it\u0027s a silent weapon! Anyway, it served its purpose admirably, and it saved your life. Does that answer your question?\u0027\n \u0027Yes and no.\u0027\n \u0027Yes and no? Theft let\u0027s deal with the \"yes\" part first. What do you mean by yes?\u0027\n \u0027Your answer goes part of the way to explaining a coincidence.\u0027\n \u0027Which is?\u0027\n That the man you helped to kill - the one in the van - believed he was a werewolf.\u0027\n That hit B.J. like a fist! And forgetting for the moment that she was in control here, she even tried to cover her momentary confusion, which Harry wouldn\u0027t notice anyway. But then, regaining control: \u0027Are you saying that you, or these \"people\" of yours, actually believe in werewolves?\u0027\n \u0027No, but the man you shot in the van did believe in them. He thought he was one. If you had believed it, too, you\u0027d use either a silver bullet, or - \u0027\n \u0027 - A silvered crossbow bolt?\u0027 (She had seen it coming).\n \u0027Yes. And you did.\u0027\n She laughed, however shakily. \u0027That bolt was ornamental! Both of them were. They were taken from the wall of a hunting lodge in the Grampians. They were decorations, hanging over a fireplace along with a lot of other old weaponry. The lodge was my uncle\u0027s place, and when he passed on I got one or two of his things. The heads of those bolts were silvered for easy cleaning, because silver can\u0027t rust!\u0027 It was all a lie; clever, but a lie. But she knew that because it at least sounded feasible, it would be that much more acceptable to her \u0027guest,\u0027 especially in his drug-induced trance. In any case, this was a \u0027normal\u0027 conversation and allowed for normal responses. So perhaps Harry had been looking for just such an answer; maybe he\u0027d even hoped for one. At any rate he sighed ... a sigh of relief, it seemed to B.J.\n Yet still she frowned and said: \u0027But if you and these . . . these \"people\" of yours don\u0027t believe in werewolves, what made you think I might?\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t say that we did,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027It was just something that required resolution, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027And is it resolved now?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Very well, and now I have a question for you.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027\n \u0027What else are you working on? You said you weren\u0027t concerned that you\u0027d been dropped by your people because you had other things to do. What things?\u0027\n Tm searching for my wife and child.\u0027\n Stranger by the moment! B.J. thought. But he couldn\u0027t be faking it. His eyes hadn\u0027t blinked once; they were still fixed firmly on the crystal pendants where they slowly revolved, continuing to seek their natural balance. \u0027Are your wife and child lost, then?\u0027\n \u0027They ... went away,\u0027 he said. \u0027From me, my work. The baby ... he ... it was a difficult birth. My wife\u0027s health suffered, mental as well as physical - or rather, mental instead of physical.\u0027\n \u0027Post-natal depression?\u0027\n \u0027And other ... problems, yes.\u0027\n \u0027So she ran away? With your baby?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027But in your line of work, with your experience, you\u0027ll be able to find them, right? I mean, like you found me? I\u0027m not in the telephone book, Harry.\u0027\n \u0027Neither is Brenda,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But I can\u0027t simply ask a taxi driver to take me to her ...\u0027 \u0027\n That\u0027s how you found me?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027So ... where will you look for them?\u0027\n \u0027Abroad. Canada. Maybe America. The West Coast. Seattle. That\u0027s where I\u0027ll start, anyway. Probably.\u0027\n \u0027And when will you go?\u0027\n \u0027As soon as possible. Maybe tomorrow. But that\u0027s a lot of questions, and it\u0027s your turn again.\u0027\n She nodded, despite that he couldn\u0027t see her; it was just that their conversation was that \u0027normal!\u0027\n \u0027You asked me if I\u0027d kiled or helped to kil those men in the garage out of revenge,\u0027 she reminded him. \u0027Well, I did. Revenge pure and simple. I told you it was because they had placed friends of mine in jeopardy, but it was more than that. I don\u0027t much like to talk about it, that\u0027s all.\u0027 (She was lying again, but trying to make it sound good). \u0027You see, one of them used to come here, into my bar. He was chatting-up one of the girls, a close friend of mine. Later he called from London, asked her down to see him. She went, and didn\u0027t come back. But she left a note of the address she\u0027d gone to.\n I waited, and eventually saw in the newspapers how her body had been discovered. After that, I felt it was all up to me. I look after my girls, Harry. Their welfare is very important to me ... \"\n At least that last part was the truth, and B.J.\u0027s story as a whole wasn\u0027t a complete falsehood. About a year ago, she had lost a girl on holiday in London. She simply hadn\u0027t come back and was still missing, B.J. presumed dead. The work of her Master\u0027s olden enemies? She prayed not...\n Meanwhile, though she had finished speaking, Harry wasn\u0027t saying anything. So B.J. prompted him: \u0027Does that sound reasonable?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered tentatively, \u0027as far as it goes. Skippy was from Newcastle. Edinburgh is a short hop. Skippy was always on the run. He might have come up here to get away from trouble in Newcastle. But... you shot at two men.\u0027\n \u0027One because he was trying to kill you,\u0027 she answered. \u0027It was dark in the garage, and he was obviously a killer. And ...\u0027\n \u0027... And the other?\u0027 Harry prompted her, his eyes as glassy and fixed as ever.\n \u0027Because I thought he was trying to run me down! I mean, I didn\u0027t actually shoot at anyone, just at the van . . . and I had to get out of there! I was frightened, Harry!\u0027 It was another clever lie. And while the Necroscope\u0027s drugged mind was absorbing it:\n \u0027Your turn, Harry,\u0027 she said. \u0027Just what is this organization you worked for?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s called E-Branch,\u0027 he said, flatly. \u0027Part of the Secret Intelligence Services. The most secret of them all.\u0027\n \u0027And your job with this E-Branch?\u0027\n He was silent, but beads of sweat had formed on his brow.\n \u0027Wel?\u0027\n \u0027I was a field agent.\u0027\n \u0027Doing what?\u0027\n \u0027You saw that for yourself. Those louts in the garage were murderers and thieves. They were responsible for the deaths of innocent people, including policemen, and your friend! I was - oh, a means of enforcing the law, where natural laws no longer applied.\u0027\n \u0027What,\u0027 she cocked her head on one side, \u0027they\u0027d given you a licence to kill?\u0027 That wasn\u0027t exactly what he\u0027d meant, but:\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m no stranger to death,\u0027 he answered. And before she could respond, \u0027But now it\u0027s your turn again. Why does an \"innocent\" girl like you have access to mind-bending drugs - like the stuff you must have put in my wine? And why, if you\u0027re so innocent, are you afraid of being questioned? Instead of hunting this Skippy and his lycanthrope friend down, why didn\u0027t you give the police the girl\u0027s last known address in London, which you told me you knew?\n Last but not least, why is someone watching you or your place - this place? A shrivelled-up little man with a face like\n ... I don\u0027t know. Like a greyhound?\u0027\n But Bonnie Jean had had more than enough of this game now. And anyway, he was much too good at it. As for that last question of his: it had shaken her to her roots!\n So: Enough of this! she thought. Now it was time to apply the real pressure ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-10.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
