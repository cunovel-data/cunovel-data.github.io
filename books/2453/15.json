{"id":80365,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"III\n RED REVENGE!\n \u0027Land?\u0027 Giorga asked again, after handing Radu a leather jack. \u0027Is that what this is all about?\u0027\n Radu took a sip of the sharp-tasting brandy - the merest sip - then put the jack down. It had been a long time and he needed a clear head. \u0027It\u0027s about land, and life, and death,\u0027 he said, and his voice was very deep, very gruff, as for the first time he turned his face fuly in Giorga\u0027s direction. And in the light from the Old Zirescu\u0027s lamp, he searched for some sign of recognition, but found nothing in the red-flecked, boozy, bulging eyes of the other. If he had - if Giorga had shown even a glimmer of recognition - then his time had come, be sure. His night visitor had already determined that it had come anyway, but al in good time, when Giorga had been given to know why.\n \u0027Well, we\u0027re face to face,\u0027 the old man told him. And that was true enough; in the close confines of Giorga\u0027s caravan they couldn\u0027t be anything else. \u0027So now let\u0027s have it: explain yourself. As for land and life and death, they\u0027re al one. If a man must fight to keep his territory, then he fights. His land is his life, and it\u0027s where he\u0027s buried when he dies!\u0027\n \u0027And wil his people fight with him, or wil they run away because they hate him?\u0027 Radu\u0027s voice was deeper yet, a rumbling growl issuing from his throat, his suddenly chaotic emotions.\n \u0027No,\u0027 the Old Zirescu pushed his face closer yet. \u0027They\u0027ll fight - because they fear him! Here in these western forests, since time immemorial, the Zirescus have always been strong. In my time, I, Giorga, have been strongest of al! I had to be.\u0027\n \u0027In your time, aye,\u0027 Radu nodded. \u0027But do you mean strongest, or hardest? Were you strong with your people, or hard on them?\u0027\n By now the old man had sobered a litle. His gaze was curious as he sat down on the wooden frame of his bed and looked Radu up and down.\n If he\u0027d seen this man before he was sure he would remember him. What, a man as tal as this; why, he must be al of six foot three!\n And his strange looks ... those eyes of his: yelow in the lamplight. And his grey hair, swept back like a mane to fal over his colar. His slightly pointed ears and long, hairy hands ... Then again, the loners were al weird in their ways and looks - this one especialy! Why, his words were almost... what, accusing?\n And suddenly Giorga suspected that this wasn\u0027t about land, and likewise that he wasn\u0027t much interested what it was about. Simultaneously, he suspected it had been a mistake to invite this man into his tiny cramped caravan in the first place.\n \u0027Whatever I\u0027ve been - and whatever I\u0027ve done - it was my way,\u0027 he answered at last, and placed his pilow as a rest for his back. But beneath that pilow he kept a long ironwood knife with a bone handle. Its edge wasn\u0027t so keen, but its point was sharp as a splinter.\n \u0027It was your way, aye,\u0027 Radu growled, \u0027and always for your own good: yours and your sons\u0027. But never for the good of your people. They do hate you, Giorga! -even as I hated you, upon a time ...\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Giorga sat up straighter, puled the pilow round in front of himself, clasped the handle of his knife. There was a good crossbow hanging on the wal, but it wasn\u0027t loaded. Supposing it had been, so what? This man looked as fast as he now looked dangerous! This isn\u0027t... it isn\u0027t about land?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, but it is!\u0027 Radu answered, sitting down carefuly at the other end of Giorga\u0027s bed and moving fractionaly, inch by inch closer. And now his voice was a hoarse throb ... of anticipation? \u0027Indeed, for it\u0027s about a man who worked that land for you, who hunted it for you, and beat the bounds with you, year in, year out, and for payment suffered the jibes and insults of a fat, greedy old man and his loathsome sons. It\u0027s about how he was murdered because he stood in the way of his daughter going to one of your sons; and it\u0027s about the girl, too, who was as good as you and your lot were bad! She was held down, Giorga, raped time and time again, then murdered because her father - by no means a brave man -had not obliged the Zirescus by letting her go as wife to Ion or Lexandru!\u0027\n \u0027I ... I ... I know you now!\u0027 Giorga pointed with his left hand. But Radu knew that the old pig was right-handed, and saw that treacherous right hand trembling behind the pilow in Giorga\u0027s lap. And indeed al of Giorga trembling: his fat bely, his chins, the very jowls of his face. And: \u0027You\u0027re Radu, son of Freji L-L-Lykan!\u0027 he stutered.\n \u0027Aye, Freji\u0027s son, and Magda\u0027s brother. That same brother who was outlawed - or who outlawed himself - when he avenged his father\u0027s death and his sister\u0027s rape and murder. Except he was stopped in the hour of his vengeance ... by you, Giorga, I fancy! And was it Ion and Lexandru who also tried to drown me? And the Ferenczy brothers, likewise on your orders? Ah, I know it was! But as you see, I am not drowned, and not nearly dead! And it is about land, or soil, after al - this soil, Zirescu soil, where you\u0027ve rooted like a pig all your days, and where you\u0027re now destined to die a swinish death. This earth, which the poisons of your loathsome gases shall turn putrid even as you\u0027re lowered into it! And no one to mourn over you, Giorga, even if they would. No, for your sons wil be down there with you!\u0027\n Giorga lunged; his black ironwood knife was in his hand, upraised; Radu grinned as he caught the other\u0027s fat wrist in his own taloned hand, and held it effortlessly. And his grin was the grin of a wolf as his leech poured metamorphic juices through his system, causing his teeth to scythe upwards from his raw red gums as his mouth yawned wider yet!\n In the space of five heartbeats Radu Lykan had changed - changed before the Old Zirescu\u0027s bulging, disbelieving eyes - into something radically different from ... from anything he\u0027d ever seen before! The man was gone, and a monster crouched in his place. And the face on that creature: the flame-eyed, salivating, grinning, panting visage of hell itself! That monstrous, gaping mouth ...!\n Giorga sucked at the suffocating air, and opened his own mouth - to cry out! But too late. Pain snatched the cry from the circle of his rubbery lips, turned it to a yelp, a gurgle, a great whoosh! of expeled air, as Radu twisted his arm until it snapped at the elbow, closed a hand over Giorga\u0027s hand, and slid the knife home through unprotesting layers of fat and up under bulging ribs. Oh ... it hurt, and it did great - even fatal - damage! But not immediately. Giorga\u0027s fat protected him; the knife\u0027s tip couldn\u0027t reach his heart, not angling up from his bely like that; his left hand ceased its fluttering and reached for the knife, clasping its handle where it protruded from his gut. And he panted, \u0027Oh! - ah! - oh!\u0027 as he tried to draw it out, but couldn\u0027t because of the pain.\n Then, stil grinning, Radu towered over him, cocked his head on one side in the inquiring manner of a great dog, and looked him right in his cringing eyes, as if he were looking into his soul. And he said, \u0027Farewel, Giorga!\u0027 - then caught his beard and yanked it up, and without pause drove his fangs into and slicing through the old man\u0027s windpipe!\n Giorga flopped and vibrated in Radu\u0027s grasp, until the werewolf released him and let him topple from his bed to the floor, where he got jammed in the narrow space. It was over, this part of it at least. And the Old Zirescu bled and tried to scream (but had neither the air nor the strength for it), and flopped about in his own blood, and bled some more; great steaming jets of crimson, pulsing from his gaping throat and punctured gut. Air whistling in and out of his severed windpipe, where bright red bubbles formed a livid froth, but al slowing down now as life quickly ebbed.\n Until finally it really was over ...\n Outside the caravan in a mist of his own making, Radu paused for the merest moment to spit Giorga\u0027s taste from his mouth. His taste and the last trace of his blood. For despite that Radu was hungry, and his leech ever hungry, Giorga Zirescu\u0027s blood tasted vile to him. Yet the memory of what he had done would always remain sweet - and sweeter still when the rest of it was over and done with.\n Radu had taken down Giorga\u0027s crossbow. Now he loaded it and his own weapon both, hooked the one to his belt and took the other firmly in a paw-like hand. And as the woods and the earth continued to issue his wreathing mist, he headed direct for the communal fire\u0027s dul orange glow in the centre of the encampment. For he had realized his strength at last; he knew his awesome power, and that he need not fear anything in man or nature - not yet at least.\n And loping low through the mist, his senses were alive with al the sounds, scents, and sensations of the night. He was a child of the night! He heard the rustling in the undergrowth that tracked the hunting shrew; sensed the hooded eyes of an owl upon him; detected an almost inaudible shrilling of tiny bats, sounding clearer than ever before in his vampire-enhanced ears. And he smeled blood, of course - the blood of the Zirescus and the Ferenczys! For Giorga\u0027s blood had not been enough. But that of his sons and their friends might yet quell the fire raging in Radu\u0027s veins ...\n The moon was up again, a ful and briliant disc shining like silver in the sky! Its beam fel in a swath, undulating on Radu\u0027s ground mist and lighting his way to the fire. Passing like a wraith between the innermost caravans and carts, he was almost there. Now he could see the ruddy faces of men in a huddle about the fire, and saw that they were frowning. Their conversation reached him; they talked about - the watchdogs, the camp\u0027s wolves!\n For the wolves were there, those tame dogs of creatures; their tails were down and their ears flat, and they whimpered around the feet of their human masters. Aye, and if they could talk they\u0027d be telling of Radu\u0027s presence, too! They probably were, in their way, but the men were too stupid to know it.\n Except if the blood of men had a scent, so did the blood of the Wamphyri - Radu\u0027s blood! And now the wolves around the fire smeled it. Moreover, they smeled the death which he had so recently wrought. There were three of them; they quit their slinking about the feet of the seated men and as one creature turned in Radu\u0027s direction. Their ears pointed him out in the shadow of a caravan, and now that they stood in the company of men, they felt safe to issue a series of growls and yips.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 someone said. \u0027Is there something there?\u0027 And indeed there was something there. Radu loped forward more surely into the fire\u0027s glow, came to a halt and straightened up. Without pause he scanned the faces in the firelight - and saw that Ion and Lexandru were there! Also the Ferenczys, and three colleagues. As scurvy a handful as he could imagine, but he hated the first four above al other men.\n All jaws dropped, all eyes were on Radu, who now grinned in his fashion and growled, This is between me and the Zirescus - those two, Ion and Lexandru, rapists and murderers!\u0027 He pointed with his crossbow. \u0027And also the Ferenczys,\u0027 he pointed again. \u0027I\u0027ve killed Giorga and now I\u0027ll kill his sons and their friends. As for the rest of you: you don\u0027t have to die if you don\u0027t want to. Enough of talk; too much, even.\u0027 No longer just pointing his weapon but aiming it, at Lexandru, Radu squeezed the trigger.\n It started as quickly as that, without any warning other than that furnished by the watchdogs. Lexandru had come to his feet as Radu spoke, and as the bolt flew to its target he held up his hands in denial.\n The bolt passed between them and struck him in the left breast, burying itself to the ironwood flights. \u0027Oh?\u0027 he said in a loud voice, as if he queried the thing. \u0027And is it - what, Radu? Not dead? Well, there\u0027s a th-thing!\u0027 Then he coughed blood, crumpled to his knees and fell on his face.\n But one of the men at the fire had sufficient wits about him to shout, j \u0027Attack!\u0027 to the wolves. And as Radu hooked the empty crossbow to his belt and levelled the other, the wolves at once sprang towards him. The leader fastened to his weapon forearm; snarling fangs bit deep; Radu grasped the wolfs mane with his free hand, whirled in a circle, and i released the disorientated animal into the sprawling fire! Twin strips of ! his flesh and skin went with it, torn from his forearm by its eye-teeth, j but Radu scarcely felt it. For he was in action, doing what he\u0027d dreamed of doing for so long. Except for now Ion and the Ferenczys must wait, for the other wolves were here.\n One of them was in mid-air, coming head-on, forepaws outstretched and muzzle slavering. Radu couldn\u0027t miss; he shot his bolt and ducked, and the skewered wolf yelped, passed overhead, bounced once and struggled to its forelegs, then collapsed and lay still. The third skidded to a halt as Radu fixed it with a feral-eyed glare and said growlingly, \u0027Oh?\n And would you die, too? Come on, then, let\u0027s get done with it. For there\u0027s room in the fire yet.\u0027 But the grey one had seen more than enough of Radu and backed off whimpering.\n Radu sensed trouble, retaliation; he\u0027d spent too long on these tame wolves! Quick as thought he fell to all fours, felt a crossbow bolt fly inches overhead even as he dropped, glanced across the fire at the knot of men.\n The Ferenczys had already bolted. Ion Zirescu was making off between the caravans, heading for the forest. The man who had shot at Radu was now readying his weapon for a second try. The others stumbled this way and that; startled out of their wits, they scarcely comprehended what was happening.\n Radu loped to the fire, stooped to snatch up a burning brand. And as the man with the crossbow nocked his bolt, Radu let fly with the firebrand, which hit him full in the face. His beard went up in fire and smoke; in another moment his head was a ball of fire! Dropping his weapon, he danced; yelped and beat at himself, and went rolling into a patch of undergrowth close by. By which time the others were all fled. But Radu had seen Ion go, and knew which direction he\u0027d taken.\n The moon came up over the trees at the edge of the clearing, and seeing it Radu went to all fours, threw back his head and howled. It seemed the most natural thing in the world, despite that the sound it made was surely one of the most terrible. For although it was the cry of a beast, the howling issued from the throat of a man! And all of his pent-up passions went into it. It told of all the pain and frustration of a tortured youth remembered and stored, and now released in a torrent of monstrous pleasure as it burst like a flood over the last of those who had caused it. It cried all his years of torment relieved, or in the process of being relieved, at least.\n For Ion Zirescu and the Ferenczys brothers still lived, and the fact of their living was itself a great torment. But their deaths would be a pleasure incomparable: like a sigh in the soul of Radu Lykan - a sigh of relief! - if he still had a soul.\n Ah, and the werewolf knew what he wanted from Ion! For he\u0027d dreamed a dream from time to time, which he now believed was more memory than dream:\n Of lying face-down in the trampled earth of a clearing, and hearing voices as if from a long way away, yet coming to him clearly through a darkness shot with brilliant flashes of light but otherwise devoid of sensation except for a terrible pain at the back of his head, and a great anger seething deep in his core, and a yearning even as great as his current yearning: to tear the living, smoking hearts out of the ones who spoke these words:\n \u0027... Radu\u0027s sister - dead, and by your hands! Six of you, onto one girl! This pair of mangy corpses here, Arlek Bargosi and Kherl Fumari, and the Ferenczy brothers, Rakhi and Lagula ... and you two, of course!\u0027 (Unmistakably Giorga\u0027s voice. And the answer):\n \u0027Not all our fault. It was you who sent us after Freji, to do him in. Well, and there was that in Radu\u0027s eyes as told us he knew!\n He must have found his father out in the woods. As for the girl: that ... was an accident, for she wouldn\u0027t hold still.\u0027\n That one had been Ion. And Magda\u0027s death had been an \u0027accident,\u0027 because she had tried to fight them off where they\u0027d rutted over her like beasts!\n Ah, but there are beasts and there are beasts, and the rest of it wouldn\u0027t be an accident, be sure! Giorga was dead, Lexandru, too, but Ion and the Ferenczys still lived. For now they lived, anyway. Again Radu howled - howled his bloodlust and a vow to the goddess of the moon where she floated on high: that Magda would be avenged in a manner befitting her ordeal! In answer, it seemed the moon lit his way through the woods by silvering the madly trampled, blundering trail of\n Ion Zirescu ... to where the last of that loathsome family was hiding. Later, Radu would scarcely remember tracking him, loping through the dark woods and faling to al fours to sniff the trail of freshly crushed grass and rootlets, the vile-smeling spoor of sweat and fear. But in a little while there\u0027d been a clearing, with a stand of trees to one side, and breaking from the woods into the clearing Radu had sensed ... stillness! Al was still; neither a sound nor any movement; not even the hoot of an owl or the furtive creep of smal creatures in the grass. Why? Because they had been startled to stillness by the sudden crashing of a fugitive? Possibly ...\n Radu\u0027s mist had subsided by then, but the moon was still ful and high and his powers were still with him. Except they were new powers and he didn\u0027t know them; he wasn\u0027t experienced in their use. But listening to the stillness - keeping absolutely still himself and straining to detect even the slightest sound - he\n \u0027heard\u0027 something that wasn\u0027t a sound! Instead, it was ... a thought! They were thoughts! The terrified thoughts of Ion Zirescu!\n At first Radu shook his head; he knew he was imagining it, this listening to another\u0027s mind. But as he concentrated even harder, so the thoughts came that much clearer, so that now he must heed them. And this was what he heard:\n ... Followed me! But how? Is he a man or a dog, to track me so unerringly? Radu Lykan, alive! Or perhaps his vengeful spirit? But a ghost that kills? And his strength! His great speed! No, this is no ghost but Radu himself. We thought him a coward like his father, but the youth who killed Kherl andArlek that night was no coward. And now he\u0027s back. But my father, Giorga, dead? Wel, so what...\n Lexandru and I would have seen to him before too long! Ahhh ...! (That last was a gasp of horror, and it signaled that Radu had been seen).\n He closed his eyes and concentrated more yet, and saw ... through another\u0027s eyes! Through Ion\u0027s, of course! Saw himself, or his shadow, poised at the edge of the clearing, head cocked forward, ears alert as they angled this way and that. And saw - and indeed felt - himself go down on al fours again, and aim himself at the stand of trees. For Ion\u0027s line of sight had given him away, and the shock of his thoughts confirmed it: ... He\u0027s pointing at me, coming straight for me! But I have my machete ...!\n Oh, yes, Radu was coming. Half-upright and leaning forward, he loped towards the stand of trees. But... Ion had a machete? Oh, really? And deep in a clump of gorse, Radu paused to ready his crossbow - four seconds at most - before continuing in a new direction, apparently away from Ion. And in his head:\n ... He\u0027ll go right by me! He hasn\u0027t seen me! (It was a sigh of relief, almost a sob - a pitiful \u0027sound\u0027! But there was no pity in Radu Lykan).\n And in the corner of his eye Radu saw Ion there, crouching in the shrubbery under the trees, behind a dense patch of brambles. But not dense enough. Radu whirled, aimed, and fired; Ion utered a cry of shock, pain, as the bolt zipped through fringing undergrowth to take him in the right forearm, spinning him until his feet tangled and he went down. His machete had flown from useless fingers. And suddenly he was a man alone, unarmed, against a monster ...\n A shadow grew out of the night\u0027s darker shadows, and as the moon slipped behind a cloud Radu Lykan was there, his eyes like yelow lamps in the darkness.\n And: \u0027Up,\u0027 he panted, his voice a cough, a bark, a hideous threat. \u0027On your feet, Ion Zirescu, or die where you lie.\u0027 He nocked the last of his bolts.\n Sobbing, Ion got up, and stumbled backwards away from Radu until he backed up against a tree. And: \u0027Perfect!\u0027 the werewolf Radu growled, as he pointed his weapon point-blank and squeezed the trigger. The ironwood bolt shatered Ion\u0027s left colarbone and nailed him to the tree; his cry of agony cut the night like a knife, and he would have blacked out but daren\u0027t. His weight would rip the muscle of his shoulder open, or stretch and tear the ligaments there, and cripple him for life. Radu heard his thoughts and inquired, \u0027What life?\u0027\n \u0027Kill me, then!\u0027 Ion sobbed. \u0027Get it done with, if that\u0027s what you want.\u0027 And with a bolt in his right arm, and another through his shoulder, holding him in place, he braced himself shuddering against the tree.\n Radu\u0027s voice was a low rumble as he answered, \u0027But that\u0027s not al I want!\u0027\n \u0027Wh-what?\u0027\n \u0027You murdered my father, then raped and kiled my sister. Wel, Freji\u0027s paid for: Giorga paid that debt. But Magda can\u0027t ever be paid for, for she was priceless.\n But you and your brother, the Ferenczys and those other two pigs, you held my sister down and took her again and again. Maybe two of you at a time ... or maybe three? I saw her body, the signs you left, your stinking froth on Magda\u0027s skin. As wel she died, for I don\u0027t think she could have lived with it. Wel, neither can I. And neither can you.\u0027\n His last words were a snarl; he hooked a hand like a claw in the front of Ion\u0027s trousers and ripped them open. Ion was caused to jerk a little, and the bolt in his shoulder dragged against raw nerves. He almost passed out, which wouldn\u0027t do at al. Radu pushed his wolfs face close, sniffed at Ion\u0027s parts and growled, That worthless thing was the instrument of your torture, your ... your pleasure?\u0027 As he closed his talon-like hand on his captive, Ion could do nothing but writhe and shudder against the tree. \u0027And you and the others, al six of you, you took turns to rape her of her innocence. Now it\u0027s my turn. Except you\u0027re not innocent.\u0027\n He crushed Ion to the tree, clenched his hand like a vice, used his vast Wamphyri strength to castrate and more than castrate the other. In a split second Ion lost everything, even the lower pipes of his body, dislocated, wrenched out of place, and left dangling. He lost consciousness, too, and would go on losing blood enough that he\u0027d never again wake up. Well, and Radu wouldn\u0027t let it go to waste, not all of it.\n While there was yet a pulse in his victim\u0027s neck, he sank a wolfs fangs into it to draw off the remainder of Ion\u0027s life.\n And drank long and deep, giving nothing of himself but taking all from the other, even the very last dregs.\n Blood ... it was what he\u0027d needed, what his vampire leech had needed. It was the nectar of life ... it was the life!\n And it was the drug that very nearly killed him, because he almost - but not quite - let himself drown in it. Because the sheer unbridled pleasure of it almost -but not quite - numbed him to everything else. Until, as if in a dream, he heard a startled gasp as someone cried:\n There! But look - only look, will you!\u0027\n Radu knew the voice: Rakhi Ferenczy, the younger of that degenerate pair. Knew the next voice, too, as that of Rakhi\u0027s brother, when Lagula answered: \u0027I see him - and I\u0027ve got the moon-crazed bastard!\u0027\n He surfaced from his delirium of bloodlust, straightened up from slaking his monstrous thirst, and shook his head -to clear his swimming senses and red-drenched vision both ...\n ... And moved - but not fast enough!\n Lagula\u0027s bolt burned his neck, cut a shallow groove in it before burying itself inches deep in the tree. Radu laughed, a great bark of a laugh . . . until Rakhi\u0027s bolt bit deep into his left thigh, scraped bone and jammed there, midway between knee and buttock.\n Radu had fired his last bolt. He had nothing to fight back with except his fierce Wamphyri strength. He would have fought, certainly, if his leech had let him. But survival was uppermost in the symbiont\u0027s \u0027mind\u0027; its host\u0027s survival, and its own, of course.\n The werewolf let himself fall to the forest\u0027s floor, went three-legged, limping through the undergrowth, but still with the sinuous, flowing motion of the Wamphyri. And this time he breathed his mist in earnest, knowing what he did, to obscure him as he fled. Not far from Ion Zirescu\u0027s dangling, ravaged body, he found the machete where it had fallen, and for a moment considered standing and fighting. But a greater wisdom (or a more sinister, insidious instinct?) forbade it. For the time being, survival was everything.\n Once, near the edge of the clearing, Radu paused to look back, and saw the Ferenczys still blundering about in his mist, searching for him (but searching oh so carefully!) in the undergrowth on the fringe of the stand of trees. The fools, to have let him slip through their fingers like this! Didn\u0027t they know, didn\u0027t they realize, that he\u0027d be back for them? Obviously not. Radu thought to remind them, and as the moon tumbled from view behind the treetops, he threw back his head and howled.\n And from now on, whenever the Ferenczy brothers heard the howling of a wolf, they would automatically tremble and reach for the nearest weapons ...\n In the western foothills, well away from the camp of the Zirescus, Radu cut the flights from the bolt that transfixed his thigh and drew it out head-first. At first there was pain, but as he gritted his teeth the pain faded to a dull throb, and in another moment all that remained was an insensitive numbness, as if his thigh were asleep.\n There were medicinal leaves Radu knew of that would help in the healing, but he didn\u0027t bother with them. Something told him they weren\u0027t necessary. It was his leech, already at work on him with its vastly superior metamorphic processes.\n Radu was a changeling creature now, but in the main his mind remained the mind of a man, and in his sleep he was visited by nightmares. He dreamed of the Thing that he\u0027d become, and woke up cold and shivering, unwilling to accept the fact that he was no longer entirely human. His vampire, of course, worked on him to subdue all such fears and regrets. Dimly, he was aware of its influence: the small urging voice of some subconscious \u0027conscience\u0027 that nagged or advised him; no voice at al, but in fact chemical agents and catalysts in his blood and his brain, changing the way he thought. Eventually he succumbed to suggestion, stopped fearing and lost interest in it; finally he accepted that he was what he was - without considering that he was what his leech wanted him to be.\n When the moon was down or on the wane, he was a man - a wolfish-looking man, by all means - but a man. When the moon was up and full, then it was hard to remain a man. But at all times he was Wamphyri, even though he still didn\u0027t understand or recognize his condition ...\n He dwelled for some years between the foothills and the barrier mountains, sleeping in deep caves or crevices by day, and wandering gradually eastwards by night. And despite that his work wasn\u0027t finished in the camps of the Szgany Zirescu - by now the Szgany Ferenczy - and that it never would be while Rakhi and Lagula lived, still he put distance between. He knew that to return now would mean certain death; the entire tribe would be watching out for him, doubtless with orders to shoot on sight. And in any case he needed time to explore his amazing powers: his mentalism, metamorphism, and the source of his boundless, surging energy. As for the wound in his thigh: that had healed in a night and a day; there was scarcely a scar to show for it.\n Adept at avoiding the encampments or settlements of men, he continued to do so; alas that they couldn\u0027t avoid him.\n But the farther east Radu journeyed, the more surely he was aware of a change. Not in himself this time, but in the Szgany, in Sunside\u0027s people themselves.\n Thus far, avoiding men, he had also avoided their challenge, or rather the challenge of his bloodlust; he had slaked his thirst (and that of his parasite) on the raw red flesh of creatures of the wild. In this respect, and without even knowing it, Radu had pitted himself against his leech! But as wel as tenacity, the vampire has al the patience of centuries of life as yet unlived. With a vampire\u0027s longevity, it\u0027s not too hard to be patient.\n And meanwhile: Radu was alowed to believe that the pleasure he\u0027d derived from slaughtering Ion Zirescu and drinking his blood had lain in the kiling, while in fact it had lain in the drinking! Revenge? That had been his motive, but necessity had been his leech\u0027s. Wel, Radu would learn in time. And meanwhile his vampire must be satisfied with the blood of beasts. Except, and as has been noted, there are beasts and there are beasts.\n And indeed great beasts had come among the Szgany of Sunside, which was the reason for the changes that Radu had noted in them. For now during the long hours of daylight, there were grim-faced, determined men on the flanks of the barrier mountains, hunters who pursued and butchered ... men! Aye, and it was butchery. For with his own eyes, Radu was witness to it.\n It happened at a time perhaps two years and nine months (one hundred and thirty-five or thirty-six sunups) after he\u0027d taken his revenge on the Zirescus in the westernmost woods ...\n It was the twilight before the true dawn, and the tumbling moon was already reduced to a pale stain of a disc high in the amethyst sky over Sunside. Soon the furnace sun would be up, but it wouldn\u0027t find Radu wanting. For by now his photophobia was full-fledged; he knew that direct undiluted sunlight would kil him, even if he stil didn\u0027t understand the reason.\n But no sooner was he settled in the back of a shallow cave, where a single stratum of soft rock had weathered out from the face of the cliff, than he heard a panting and scrabbling from beyond the rim of his shelter. It was a man in full flight, exhausted from his exertions and hoarse from the terror of pursuit. Dried up and beginning to blister even in the first faint rays from the southern horizon, he came stumbling, croaking his relief, into Radu\u0027s cave.\n Hidden in a dark corner, Radu shielded the luminous yelow glare of his eyes and waited until the man - a ragged-looking Sunsider, possibly a loner - had himself under partial control at least. And when the other\u0027s panting had slowed and his whimpering ceased, then, speaking softly, Radu asked: \u0027Who pursues you, and why?\u0027\n At the first word the other had jumped a foot, gasped out loud, spun about where he sat upon the dusty floor. \u0027What?\u0027 he croaked. \u0027Who?\u0027\n And then he saw Radu\u0027s eyes, and the dark shape of a man sprawled on a bed of heather in the back of the cave. Radu\u0027s crossbow was loaded; aiming it at the man, he eased himself erect - or partly erect, because of the low ceiling - and went to where the newcomer cringed against the wal of the cave. The man seemed speechless; his throat throbbed and his Adam\u0027s apple went up and down, but he merely gurgled. And finaly he pointed at Radu\u0027s face, at his eyes.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Radu growled, rapidly losing his patience. He wanted to know what was going on here. If this man was a fugitive, he wanted to know why, from what cause. \u0027Are you deaf or daft, or both? I asked why are you running?\u0027\n \u0027Y-you, ask that?\u0027 Finaly the other had found his voice.\n And perhaps Radu understood at that. He narrowed his feral eyes, sniffed his suspicion. \u0027Are you a Ferenczy, is that it? Have you heard about me and what I\u0027ve done, and what I\u0027ll do!\u0027 He pointed his crossbow direct at the other\u0027s throat. But even in the act of speaking the words, he knew he was mistaken. The Ferenczys had become an obsession with him, that was al.\n \u0027A F-Ferenczy?\u0027 The fugitive frowned. \u0027No, I\u0027m a Romani - Bela Romani, of the Szgany Mirlu. Or I was ... \" And now the sob was back in his voice.\n \u0027Are you an outcast then? What, a leper?\u0027 The Zirescus had used to banish anyone even suspected of leprosy. And they\u0027d put a bolt through him and burn his body if he tried to return!\n \u0027Leprosy?\u0027 The other looked at Radu through haggard, red-rimmed eyes. \u0027Ah, no. Worse than that!\u0027\n Radu backed off a pace. What? Could anything be worse than leprosy? \u0027Explain!\u0027 he barked.\n \u0027Who ... what are you?\u0027 Now it was Bela Romani\u0027s turn to be curious. \u0027A loner? A wild man of the mountains? Where have you been that you don\u0027t ... don\u0027t know of these things?\u0027\n \u0027Of what things?\u0027 Radu was exasperated. \u0027Enough of riddles! Can\u0027t you explain yourself?\u0027\n The other crouched back away from him. \u0027I\u0027m speaking of... of the Wamphyri!\u0027 But the way he spoke that last word, or name!\n \u0027Wamphyri?\u0027 Radu repeated him, and frowned. \u0027Who are they?\u0027\n The other licked his lips and shook his head. \u0027But you ... your eyes! Are you saying that you\u0027re not... not one of them?\u0027\n And for the first time Radu pondered it. He was more than a mere man, for sure. But Wamphyri? \u0027Tel me about them,\u0027 he gave a nod of his huge grey wolfish head. And Bela Romani told him:\n It had started in the east, beyond the great pass into Starside and the barren boulder plains. There were rearing stacks out on those plains, vast carved butes, some a kilometre high, either weathered from the mountains over countless millennia or thrust up from below by some colossal, forgotten prehistoric upheaval. The boulder plains were empty of life, cold and dead, for which reason men never went there.\n Or at least, that was how it had used to be; neither the Szgany nor any other beings had dwelled there, except leathery trog unmen in caverns under the barrier mountains. But for some years now there\u0027d been rumours of lights in those rearing rock castles, and grey smoke issuing from fissure chimneys, and flying things that soared in the winds off the northern Icelands, around the summits of those mighty aeries of... of what?\n And a hundred sunups ago the first of Them had come raiding on the Szgany camps. They came in search of provisions for their manses in the towering stacks, thrall recruits for their aeries, and fodder for their beasts. But they themselves, the Wamphyri, were the greatest beasts of all: blood-beasts out of Starside!\n Huge men all, the Wamphyri looked human but were mhuman. Their strength was unbelievable! They took strong Szgany youths for their lieutenants and thralls, and beautiful girls as their odalisques. Chiefest among them was One whose nature had rapidly become a byword for everything evil: Shaitan the Unborn! He was beautiful as a golden man, but deep and dark as the swamps that spawned him. And his lust was insatiable.\n At first Shaitan had restricted his raids to regions east of the great pass, and had set up tribes of Szgany supplicants there. But as other monstrous Lords had ascended to their aeries, and the needs of the Wamphyri had doubled and redoubled, so the raids had spilled over from the eastern lands into Zestos, Lidesci, Tireni, and Mirlu territories west of the pass, and sometimes to points even further west. But the Szgany Zestos, the Lidescis, Tirenis, Mirlus, were not supplicants; they fought back! And now during the daylight hours they travelled - they had become Travellers - as a matter of survival, and not merely to beat the bounds. But during the nights:\n \u0027We hid in deep caves or in the woods, with never a fire for comfort or light,\u0027 Bela continued. \u0027But still the Wamphyri would find us. Last night - following immediately on the evening twilight - they found us again! There was some fighting, but what can men do against Them? The Szgany Mirlu scattered ... I ran, too, into the woods! But I was caught anyway.\n \u0027Hengor \"the Gust\" Hagi, a blood-soaked barrel of a man, got me, clubbed me unconscious, drank blood from my veins and infected me with his poisons. When I came to in the twilight before the dawn, I remembered his instructions as in a dream: that I must go to him in Starside, and be his thrall in Hengstack. Never! I would return to my wife and children, and be a Mirlu! Oh, really? Hah!\n \u0027I was -1 am - a vampire creature, in thrall to Hengor the Gust! The sun is my mortal enemy, the night my only friend. As the poisons take hold, so my condition will worsen. I tried to return to the Mirlus; they saw the mark of Hengor\u0027s bite on my neck; now if they find me - they\u0027ll kill me! But you, your looks,\u0027 Bela turned imploringly to Radu. \u0027We are the same, I\u0027m sure. Except... you seem to have learned to live with it!\u0027\n Radu shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know. But one thing is certain: I won\u0027t die with it! While you were talking, I was listening, but not as you listen. And you\u0027re right: Mirlu hunters are coming. And this cave ... is mine. I was here first.\u0027\n Bela\u0027s eyes went wild in a moment. Drawing his lips back from snarling needle teeth, he made to spring at Radu -\n - Who simply caught him up in one hand, dragged him to the mouth of the cave and tossed him out!\n The entrance was fringed with a little undergrowth and a few trees, and the sunlight didn\u0027t strike at Bela immediately. He tried to stay in the shade, searched for a way up the cliff. There was a goat track; he might even make it! He scrambled up above the tree level, and so came into view of the men who had followed him up through the scree jumbles of the foothills.\n Crossbows twanged and bolts buzzed like angry wasps. Radu saw it all: the way the fugitive was swatted like a fly against the cliff, his feet sliding on the narrow track, his back arching like a bow, as he was struck time and time again. His body crumpling, then toppling, and turning lazily end over end, and slamming down hard into the sharp rubble and scree at the foot of the cliffs.\n Anyone would think that would be enough, that Bela\u0027s pursuers would be satisfied; apparently they weren\u0027t. They took his body, drove a stake through his heart and cut off his head, and built a fire to burn him to ashes! Which apparently was enough. It would have to be, for there was nothing left of him. It took a while but finally the men left, and Radu crept back into his cave to sleep in safety from the sun.\n Getting to sleep took a while, too, for there was a great deal on Radu\u0027s mind. Yet somehow, while he slept, a good many problems were resolved. And it might even be said that he resolved some of them himself...\n In the twilight before the true night Radu awakened, felt the lure of the fading moon and left his cave to worship a while. And as his eerie, ululant howling echoed up into the mountain heights and down into Sunside, he knew. Knew finally and for certain that he was Wamphyri! An eater of men, aye, a Great Vampire. But more than this: he was a werewolf! A man half-human, half-wolf, with the brain of the one and al the speed and cunning and killer instinct of the other. And if changeling men - mere men! - could make it on Starside, where the sun never shone, and be Lords and masters of the great aeries there, then what of Radu? And so, turning his back on Sunside (for now, at least), he climbed for the peaks and headed for Starside and the destiny that waited for him there.\n And there was such a monstrous joy in Radu - the joy of darkling knowledge, the hideous anticipation of living off the life-blood of others - that he could scarcely contain it. For Bela Romani had had it quite wrong, and Radu wasn\u0027t like him at al. Oh, the same fever was in his blood, certainly, but where Bela had been a mere thral infected with the disease of vampirism, Radu was that disease! By virtue of his parasite he was Lord Radu Lykan! And he knew it.\n For weling up from deep within his werewolf body and vampire heart, it was as if he heard the first discordant notes of a strange, savage, and wonderful song.\n And how that silent song of blood and eternity thriled him to his core, when at last he came padding, panting through a high mountain pass, and finaly gazed down on Starside.\n Starside, aye. And faint with distance yet darkly foreboding against a backdrop of writhing northern auroras, there in the cold blue light of the Northstar ... the mist-wreathed stacks of the vampire Lords! But however awesomely bleak, the scene wasn\u0027t weird or cold to Radu. Indeed it felt... familiar? No, much more than that: it felt like home!\n And as he turned his face to the sky and vanishing moon, and gave voice from a throbbing throat, it seemed to Radu that even his howling carried a new note and was more surely a song, albeit a song that was awesome and terrible:\n Wamphyri! Wamphyyyyri...! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-15.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
