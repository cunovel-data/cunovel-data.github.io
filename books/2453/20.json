It was a little after midday, raining, and blowing a gale. Buffeted along the slippery pavements, she thought: The windy fucking city, indeed!\n Furious by the time she arrived at the bar - mainly with herself, but also with the way things were or were not working out - she had to call one of her girls down from her bedroom, from where she was supposed to be watching the street outside, to let her in!\n - \u0027Didn\u0027t you see me arrive?\u0027\n \u0027I... I was using your toilet,\u0027 the girl told her.\n Two other girls, who were in the vicinity and witnessed B.J. \u0027s arrival, reported to her in the bar as she was towelling her hair and trying to dry out.\n \u0027Any luck?\u0027 She glared at them. \u0027What of the watcher? Has he been back? And Harry Keogh? Have you found him?\u0027 But seeing the negative look on their faces: \u0027Let\u0027s get this place tidied up, sorted out. We open tonight. If we stay closed any longer, it will only attract attention. I\u0027ll make adjustments to your duties as soon as I get the chance.\u0027 And finally, as she made to head upstairs: \u0027Any calls?\u0027\n \u0027A few,\u0027 the girl from her bedroom told her. They\u0027re on your answering machine. I didn\u0027t monitor them. You didn\u0027t tell me to . .\n B.J. rushed through the bar and up the stairs to her bedroom. There were three calls from regulars wanting to know when the bar would be open again, and two more from someone or ones who said nothing, but the next and last -\n - Was from Harry:\n \u0027B.J.?\u0027 (He sounded unsure of himself, tinny, distant). \u0027I said I would call you before I went off. So, I\u0027m calling. Tried to get you twice already - nothing doing. Too early, I suppose. Sorry about that. So, I\u0027ll be away\n maybe a month, I\u0027m not sure. About a month, yes. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m bothering you, really. That\u0027s it, then ... \" But after a long pause:\n \u0027Oh, and by the way, that Greek wine of yours is ... good stuff? Well, let\u0027s say it\u0027s an \"acquired taste,\" eh? But a damn good way to get to sleep nights, when your mind just can\u0027t stop ticking over! Know what I mean? No, I don\u0027t suppose you do ...\u0027\n (Another pause, then):\n Til be in touch ... \" And. again a long silence before the \u0027phone went dead.\n And: \u0027Damn!\u0027 B.J. said under her breath, expelling all of her air in a heavy sigh before taking her first deep breath for what seemed like the first time that day.\n She breathed in ... and held it. Now what in all - ?\n Aftershave? Old Spice? Harry\u0027s aftershave? It must be. But lingering on, all this time since he\u0027d been here? Except... he hadn\u0027t been here, not \u0027up\u0027 here, not in her bedroom! Or was it just his voice that had set it off? But damn it all, she could smell him - him, and not just his aftershave! He was that real, that vivid, tantalizing, in her mind ... And in her room?\n B.J.\u0027s eyes were suddenly feral in the gloomy quiet of her room, with the curtains drawn and the rain pattering on the window panes. Her nostrils gaped; she turned her head sharply this way and that! She sniffed, as she tracked the essence of a man, his scent, his odour. But here, in her bedroom ... where he had never been.\n Oh, really?\n She flew down one flight to her living-room. Nothing! His scent wasn\u0027t here - or if it was, it was just the merest trace.\n He may have been here, but he hadn\u0027t lingered here. He\u0027d gone ... up to her bedroom!\n She bounded back up the stairs. And there it was again ... like a familiar perfume, hanging on the air. His scent, and the sweet human smell of her girl. Hers, and his.\n B.J. called for her, screamed for her, down the stairwell. \u0027Moreen! Come up here! Come now!\u0027\n She came, looking confused, frightened, astonished. B.J. took her by the shoulders and shook her. \u0027He was here! He was here - with you!\u0027\n \u0027He what? Who?\u0027 Moreen was a stunning redhead, twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Her green eyes were wide, amazed, disbelieving. Finally she broke free. \u0027B.J., no one was here. Not while I was here, anyway!\u0027 And she shrank away from the other, especially from her looks. \u0027You look like ... like a wild thing!\u0027\n And B.J. knew that she did, that she was. But at least it was controllable. She pulled herself together, willed the thing hiding within her to subservience, then slumped on her bed. \u0027He was here,\u0027 she said, mainly to herself. \u0027Maybe not with you, if you say so. But here, certainly.\u0027\n The watcher?\u0027 Moreen was genuinely mystified. \u0027You think I would invite - ?\u0027\n B.J. shook her head. \u0027Not the watcher, no. Damn, we don\u0027t even know if the watcher exists, not for sure! I\u0027m just taking Harry Keogh\u0027s word for it. He\u0027s the one I\u0027m talking about. Him, Harry Keogh himself, who tossed Big Jimmy about like a sack of coal that night!\u0027\n \u0027The one we\u0027re looking for?\u0027\n B.J. bared her teeth. \u0027I can smell him, right here.\u0027\n Then you\u0027re mistaken.\u0027 The girl tossed her head almost defiantly, and sat down beside the bed on a chair.\n B.J. sat up, took hold of Moreen\u0027s shoulders again, more gently this time. \u0027Look, this is important. Were you here all the time?\u0027\n \u0027Why, no, of course not. How could I be?\u0027 the other said, and gave a defensive shrug. \u0027I mean I had to eat, sleep, attend to various other things. But when it was important to be here, then I was here.\u0027\n \u0027When it was important? When, exactly?\u0027\n \u0027I sat at that window,\u0027 the girl pointed, \u0027oh, until two or half-past two each morning, just watching the road outside. And you have no idea how boring that can get to be, B.J. But I did it anyway, for you.\u0027\n \u0027And then you slept? Where, and how long?\u0027\n \u0027Wrapped in a spare blanket, in the barroom beside one of the big radiators.\u0027\n \u0027Downstairs, you\u0027re sure?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And if someone had got in?\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s why I slept down there!\u0027 Moreen was close to tears. \u0027Any burglar or intruder would have had to get past me. I\u0027m usually a light sleeper and would hear him. But I was up each morning by six-thirty, so as to come up here and check if anyone was watching us in the early mornings - this morning especially ... \"\n B.J. was quick to catch that one. \u0027Why? What was so special about this morning?\u0027\n There were two calls. I heard the \u0027phone ring before your answer machine took over. I seem to remember checking the time; the first call was, oh, about five-thirty I think, and the second maybe fifteen minutes later. That one woke me up more yet. I tossed and turned a bit, then must have dozed for a few minutes. But about six o\u0027clock, I thought I heard something.\u0027\n \u0027What did you hear?\u0027 B.J. tightened her grip.\n \u0027I heard the boards creak, somewhere up here. But it was windy and raining; it was just the old house protesting.\u0027\n B.J. thought about it. Harry could have called from any telephone. A telephone box in the street, even. He\u0027d called twice, got no answer,\n given up and come here personally. But how had he got in past Moreen? And more importantly, what did he want? Suddenly the answer was clear in her mind.\n As clear as his voice on her answering machine ...\n \u0027Go down and help the others,\u0027 she said, standing up. \u0027I... I\u0027m sorry I was so excited, sorry I shouted. Things could be working out better, that\u0027s all. You understand?\u0027\n The girl looked worried now. \u0027B.J., are we in trouble?\u0027\n \u0027Not if I can help it,\u0027 she shook her head. \u0027Do as I say, and don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027\n But as soon as the girl was gone she turned to her bed, stooped and reached underneath, and drew out a three-by-four cardboard wine crate. There were three bottles of her \u0027Greek\u0027 wine sitting neatly in their sockets in the last row. Three, yes. But B.J. knew there should be four!\n Oh, she\u0027d weaned him on, all right, this oh-so-talented Harry Keogh, this \u0027mysterious\u0027 Mr Keogh! And the longer she knew him the more talented and mysterious he got to be ...\n It wasn\u0027t quite a month before Harry was back; in fact, it was twenty-five days. And B.J. needn\u0027t have worried about weaning him off her wine - Radu\u0027s wine, actually - for Harry had been doing that, or trying to do it for himself, and fairly successfully. A single shot on a night, before sleeping, was all he\u0027d allowed himself. And he\u0027d tried tempering the stuff with other brews. Jack Daniel\u0027s Old No. 7 had been one such: a top-quality liquor whose potency should leave any mere wine standing at the post. But that stuff of B.J.\u0027s was definitely ... oh, something else! It was very much to Harry\u0027s taste - or Alec Kyle\u0027s taste, whichever. Its only drawback was what it did to him: his stinging eyes, dry throat, fluffy head; all the symptoms of a heavy cold, for which it seemed to be the only cure! There was a word for it: addiction, which Harry realized well enough. It was why he would only take it on a night, and then only one small shot.\n Even so, it interfered with his search. Except (as he had come to realize by the end of his three weeks and four days in Seattle, Washington, USA), his \u0027search\u0027 was a joke. And a joke that he was playing on himself.\n Of course, with the Mobius Continuum at his fingertips - his to command - he hadn\u0027t needed to stay in Seattle. He could come and go as he wished; spend every night at home in Bonnyrig if he so desired. But he hadn\u0027t desired.\n Truth to tell, the old house where his beloved Ma had died and his murdering black-hearted bastard of a stepfather, Viktor Shukshin, had continued to live - until his past and Harry had caught up with him, at least - was a cheerless sort of place, ominous and full of evil memories.\n It would be a long time, if ever, before the Necroscope could think of it as \u0027home\u0027 in the truest sense of the word.\n Which was why he\u0027d hired a so-called \u0027house\u0027-boat down on the waterfront in Seattle, paying a month\u0027s rent in advance for far less comfort and only half the space he\u0027d been used to even in his and Brenda\u0027s tiny garret flat in Hartlepool, in the ... in the old days. But the flat had worse memories than the house in Bonnyrig, which was one of the reasons he had got rid of it. He\u0027d thought about taking a hotel room, or a suite. Why not? He could easily stay at the city\u0027s finest, if he fancied; and just as easily skip out without paying the bill when it was time to Mobius on. Except hotels weren\u0027t him.\n But, \u0027the old days?\u0027 Funny, that it seemed so long ago! Funny, yes ... for a man whose incorporeal, metaphysical mind had once had access to all of the past, and all of the future, and as much of space as he or any man could live in or explore even in an eternity of lifetimes!\n And the funniest thing of all - or the most ironic - was that he still had it but couldn\u0027t use it. Not to its, or his, best advantage. Not until he\u0027d found Brenda and the baby.\n The past? That was over and done. There was nothing there to help him now, even if he had access to it. Which he didn\u0027t; and that, too, was funny. Incorporeal, he\u0027d been able to \u0027immaterialize\u0027 in the past. But now if he went there, he\u0027d be like a toy man on a toy train that went in a circle - or figure-of-eight loop? - and never stopped; with all the stations passing him by, but never able to get off.\n And as for space - which in this case meant the total of all the places, the geographic locations, in the world - well, he had access to those, certainly. But there were millions of them, and Brenda and the baby were only in one of them.\n Which one was anybody\u0027s guess. The Great Majority couldn\u0027t help him, because they had no contact with the living except Harry himself. And the living ... ?\n Of all living people, the E-Branch specialists - Darcy Clarke\u0027s espers - should have been able to tell him something.\n Yet they\u0027d told him nothing. And he believed them; they simply didn\u0027t know. So where did that leave Harry? What chance did he stand? A very slim one, at best.\n Yet there he\u0027d been in Seattle, Washington, USA (why, he couldn\u0027t say), allegedly \u0027searching\u0027 for two people who were, or should be, very dear to him. And he wasn\u0027t even sure about that last part, either! Love Brenda? But she didn\u0027t love him, didn\u0027t even know the him he was now! And love the baby? What, little Harry, who knew more than he did about everything that made him what he was?\n And yet Harry must search, if only to find out why they\u0027d left him. No, not even that, for he knew why: because he wasn\u0027t him, and because the things he\u0027d done - and others he might yet do - were dangerous. The baby loved his Ma, that was all, just as Harry loved his Ma. Except this baby wasn\u0027t about to let anything happen to Brenda.\n And so back to that word: \u0027search.\u0027 Big joke! In England it had seemed to make sense. Close to Brenda\u0027s source, she had felt more real, she\u0027d seemed feasible. Here she seemed impossible. So what it boiled down to was Harry wandering about in a strange body in a strange city in a strange land, praying he\u0027d somehow collide with someone who was trying her best to avoid him! And she had a million other places in which to do it. And things were mainly a blur anyway, because he felt like hell...\n Maybe if he hadn\u0027t run out of B.J. \u0027s wine he would have stayed on even longer, doing nothing much. But it was starting to look like the wine wasn\u0027t the only thing that had him under its spell. B. J. herself kept coming back to mind: some beguiling thing about her, some promise he\u0027d made, or she\u0027d made. Or maybe some unspoken promise that he wished they\u0027d made.\n Harry wasn\u0027t too pleased with himself that he had stolen B.J. \u0027s wine, but whatever else he did he knew (or hoped) that he wouldn\u0027t have to steal any more. With any luck it was out of his system now. And truth to tell his \u0027problem\u0027 - his, or Alec Kyle\u0027s alcoholism - had narrowed itself down, become specific. For it was now an established fact that the Necroscope couldn\u0027t or didn\u0027t want to drink any other kind of liquor. What was the point when it had little or no effect on him, except in massive doses? So maybe that was why he\u0027d come home at this time: to be closer to B.J., and to her wine.\n HeU of a note!\n And what the hel kind of alcoholism was this anyway? Was it possible for a smoker to be addicted to just one brand? What if they stopped making it? After he\u0027d finished his last pack of Brand X, what then? He\u0027d never smoke again? The Necroscope had never heard of anything like it. And neither had his Ma.\n Have it analysed, she told him. See what\u0027s in it. Maybe it has an antidote.\n Harry was sitting on the river bank where he had materialized, his first port of call upon his return. It had been just after six a. m. in Seattle when he\u0027d woken up, lifted his head, and looked at an empty bottle sitting there on a shelf at the side of his bookcase headboard. An empty bottle and an empty glass. And his first thought had been that he had used up the wine and there\u0027d be none for tonight. That had been some twenty minutes, a wash, shave and a good stiff toothbrushing while he was still brave enough to put something in his mouth, ago - plus a minute or two to get dressed. While here in Scotland it was mid-afternoon. A decently warm spring day; the sun shining, birds singing and all ... and Harry feeling rotten.\n \u0027Mobius-lagged!\u0027 he grumbled, and at once bit his tongue. He shouldn\u0027t be talking about that stuff to anyone - or even thinking about it where the dead were concerned. Even his Ma. He\u0027d have to learn to guard his thoughts about... about that sort of thing.\n Nonsense! his Ma answered. But she was talking about his comment, not about his regretting it. You\u0027re not any kind of lagged! You\u0027re hung over, that\u0027s all.\n He was glad to change the subject. \u0027Yes, probably. Except it doesn\u0027t go away.\u0027\n So do as I tell you! And anyway, if that\u0027s the end of it, it\u0027s the end of it. Thank goodness for that.\n \u0027But I know where there\u0027s more.\u0027 And again he could have bitten his tongue, for she was on him like a ton of bricks: Leave it alone, Harry! That\u0027s all I can do, advise you. You have a mind, and therefore you have a choke: be an alcoholic or don\u0027t be. It\u0027s one or the other. To be or not to be. It\u0027s up to you. No one can order you not to drink, but by the same token no one can make you drink!\n But in the back of the Necroscope\u0027s head, a voice seemed to say, \u0027Oh, really?\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t know what it meant, and so ignored it. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he said out loud, \u0027credit where credit\u0027s due: I\u0027m fighting it. It\u0027s just this last wrinkle in my - or Alec Kyle\u0027s - grey mater. It needs ironing out, that\u0027s all. It\u0027s something that\u0027s residual of him, like his precognition. But I can feel it adjusting to fit me, I think. And if I don\u0027t use it, don\u0027t pander to it, it will... I don\u0027t know, atrophy? It\u0027s just a mater of time, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\n His precognition? She repeated him, as glad as he was to change the subject. Have you been having more visions, then?\n \u0027No,\u0027 Harry shook his head - And at once reeled, and grabbed at the root of a tree to keep from toppling from the bank! For his Ma\u0027s question had seemed to bring something on, a scene obscured by what appeared to be mental static -until the Necroscope realized that he was seeing it through a blizzard!\n A frozen monochrome landscape, like the roof of the world, and a gaunt range of mountains marching against grey skies that went on forever. It was cold - a biting cold - that was so real Harry could even feel it gnawing at him; and the snow slanting down like a million white spears, piercing his warmth as they landed and formed an ever-thickening layer on his being, his mind, his psyche ...\n ... It was gone, leaving him shivering and reeling, while his Ma\u0027s dead voice cried in his mind: Harry! What on earth - ? But what she should have been asking was where. Where on earth? For Harry had seen nothing like it; he\u0027d never been in or imagined being in such a place. He gasped for air, could scarcely believe that he was warm and the sun still shining down on him. It had been so very real. And damn it, he could feel it coming back again!\n He had let go of the root but now clutched at it again, as the thing invaded his senses and tore him from his reality into its own: The iron-grey mountains, snow-capped, ridged with carved, drifted snow; and the valleys and passes between the spurs and peaks full of it,\n like white dunes rolling to rearing horizons of stone. But to Harry\u0027s right. . . what, a city? A walled city, yes, protected in the lee of the mountains and by a long, snaking wall - like a miniature version of the Great Wall of China - with gaunt square towers, battlements, mighty gates. But the old, cold city was dead and empty; it huddled down into itself behind the wall, and kept its secrets ...\n It was much like a scene from some old geography book in Harry\u0027s secondary modern school at Harden. And once again the thought struck him: the Roof of the World, yes! But... Tibet? Why was he seeing a scene out of Tibet?\n The blizzard had fallen of a little. (Harry felt the familiar river bank under his thighs) - but he also felt the cold of the snows gnawing in his bones, and saw a scene from incredible distances of space, or even out of future time, enacted on the screen of his mind. But Harry was the Necroscope and could handle it, perhaps even better than Alec Kyle himself. And finally accepting it, no longer fighting it, he shielded his eyes against the falling snow and stared harder.\n Out there on the white waste ... movement? Single file, a line of seven people - antlike figures, at this range - were making their way across the snow. They were robotic in their movements, like a military drill routine -left, right, left, right, left-but rapid and shuffling. The three in front were dressed in red, also the three bringing up the rear. But the one in the middle was all in white. And as if from a million miles away, the Necroscope could hear the chiming of tiny golden bells ...\n ... The cold receded, was gone from mind and body in a moment; the river swirled below; Harry swayed like a drunkard, and his Ma had time for a single word - Son! - before Alec Kyle\u0027s talent struck again.\n It was no longer snowing. Harry saw the six - what, monks? And one initiate? - out on the snows, tramping single-file as before. But the walled city was no longer in sight; the location was different. This time, in front of the six, the base of a sheer clif reared like a titan face. It was a face: carved out of the rock! But if the location was cold, that great grim visage in the rock was colder still.\n It could only be a temple, (a monastery?) with huge steps carved from the bedrock leading up to the entrance: the yawning mouth of the great face. And up the steps the seven went, to where a portcullis was lifted and the throat became a passageway into the monastery. Then: Sheer fantasy!\n For as the seven disappeared inside ... so the face became flesh! The great jaws snapped shut, and the eyes opened wide to burn crimson as hell! And suddenly the no-longer-stone face was smiling the devil\u0027s own smile!\n Harry couldn\u0027t believe his eyes. He blinked - And stared up at a blue sky, where wisps of cloud drifted across a blinding sun. He\u0027d toppled over onto his back, and was lying there on the river bank with his mouth wide open. Dazzled, Harry blinked again -and at once gritted his teeth, cringing down into himself in anticipation of another shift. But no, it was over now, and it gradually dawned on the Necroscope that he knew it was over.\n Then, struggling to sit up, and gasping the words out, he began to ask his mother, \u0027Ma, did you - ?\u0027\n Of course I saw it! She cut him short. We\u0027re in contact; I saw what you saw. But Harry, what does it mean? What was it?\n Harry stood up and shakily, absentmindedly brushed himself down. Finally he shook his head. \u0027Whatever it was, it certainly wasn\u0027t delirium tremens!\u0027\n But it\u0027s all tied up, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s all one and the same! Harry, are you into another of these ... these things of yours? Her dead \u0027voice\u0027 overflowed with concern.\n Things?\u0027 Harry\u0027s mouth was dry; he hadn\u0027t quite given up expecting something else to happen.\n You know what I mean, his Ma insisted. Are you in trouble again, son?\n And for the first time the Necroscope wondered, Am I?\n But out loud, without really considering what he said, he answered, \u0027Ma, to the best of my knowledge, I\u0027m not in any real \"trouble\" trouble. I don\u0027t think so, anyway. And that\u0027s fine by me, because I\u0027ve got enough problems as it is. So don\u0027t you go wishing any more on me, okay?\u0027\n And yet again he could have bitten his tongue, because what he\u0027d said wasn\u0027t nearly what he\u0027d meant. But too late now.\n Well! his Ma said, in a certain way she had, making that one small word an entire statement on its own. Following which she wasn\u0027t much inclined to talk to him any more ...\n Harry walked the river path to the arched-over gate in the garden wall, and letting himself into the garden became aware of a car\u0027s engine fading to silence at the front of the house. Since the rest of the houses in this once select, now neglected location were derelict, this could only be someone visiting or delivering to him.\n Avoiding the brambles as best he could, Harry ran up the garden path and quickly let himself in. He could have taken the Mobius route, of course, but the more sparing he was in his use of the Continuum, the less likely he\u0027d be to give away its secret inadvertently. In a few seconds he was through the house to the front, where it took only a moment or so to unlock and open the door. Outside, a tall, slim young man was already half-way back down the walled yard to the gate that he had left open. In his hand was a large manila envelope. Beyond the gate, a black car stood waiting on the rutted service road. Hearing the door of the house open, the man turned and saw Harry.\n \u0027Delivery,\u0027 he said, showing Harry the envelope. And trying hard not to show too much interest, his keen, curious eyes looked the Necroscope over.\n Harry returned the other\u0027s cautiously appraising look and said: \u0027You don\u0027t much look like a typical postman.\u0027 And it was true, he didn\u0027t. No uniform for one thing, and the car outside wasn\u0027t a post van, and the envelope had no address or stamps.\n The other shrugged. \u0027Wel then, let\u0027s say it\u0027s \"special\" delivery. Or beter still - \u0027\n \u0027 - E-Branch,\u0027 Harry\u0027s mouth turned down at the corners as the man started back up the path. \u0027Do I know you?\u0027 He held the house door open to let his visitor in.\n They both had to avoid trampling a month\u0027s worth of mail - most of it junk - on the coconut-fibre mat just inside the door.\n The other shook his head, held out his hand, which Harry pointedly ignored. He\u0027d told Darcy he was finished with al of this. \u0027Munroe,\u0027 the stranger let his hand fal. \u0027James Munroe. And no, we haven\u0027t met. I\u0027m usualy on embassy duties here and abroad, \"checking out the talent,\" so to speak. I\u0027m a spoter, only recently returned from Italy to home duties - rotation of embassy staff, and what have you. Today I sensed you were back at last...\u0027 He paused and frowned. \u0027But I\u0027m puzzled you didn\u0027t answer the door sooner. Is there a problem, Mr Keogh?\u0027\n \u0027No problem,\u0027 Harry led him through the house to the room he\u0027d designated as his study, whose patio doors looked out over the garden, directed him to a chair and seated himself. \u0027I was out in the garden, that\u0027s al. But did you say \"back at last?\" How long have you been waiting for me, then?\u0027\n \u0027For a fortnight. In Edinburgh, coming out here each day to see if you were home yet.\u0027\n As they talked, Harry had checked James Munroe over. He would be six foot one or two, twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, one hundred and forty-five pounds maximum. His fare was angular: jutting chin, pointed nose and ears, and jet-black hair, swept back and lacquered down. His eyes saved him from looking cynical, or even sinister; they were wide, brown, penetrating and honest. The sort you could look into and not worry about what was going on in there.\n \u0027A fortnight? Coming out here every day? It\u0027s that important?\u0027\n To you, I believe.\u0027 Munroe shrugged. \u0027And possibly beneficial to the Branch, too, but I\u0027m just guessing. It\u0027s the way we work, as you know.\u0027 He was staring, and Harry was suddenly uncomfortable.\n \u0027Is there something?\u0027 he snapped.\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 the other sat up straighter, was at once startled. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry! I was staring, right? It\u0027s just that when you asked if you knew me, I almost answered, \"No, but I once knew you.\" But Darcy Clarke has told me you\u0027re touchy about that.\u0027\n Harry sighed, nodded and said, \u0027Alec Kyle. Yes, I\u0027m sometimes touchy about it. But I\u0027m geting used to it - to him - to certain aspects of him, anyway.\u0027 He.was nervous. This was geting too close to stuff he couldn\u0027t talk about.\n \u0027It\u0027s funny,\u0027 the other said, \u0027but on you he looks - oh, I don\u0027t know -younger?\u0027\n \u0027Oh? Wel, he feels ancient!\u0027\n \u0027I meant younger ... overall,\u0027 Munroe hurriedly corrected himself. \u0027I mean, it\u0027s like I can sense a younger man shining through. But shining too brightly, maybe?\n Burning up?\u0027 \u0027What are you, an empath, too?\u0027\n The other\u0027s turn to sigh. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m realy fucking this up, right? But I\u0027ve read your files. You\u0027re the Necroscope, and I expected ... no, I didn\u0027t know what to expect! And I didn\u0027t mean to say that, either! I mean - you know - I\u0027m not usualy a rude person, Mr Keogh ...\"\n And now there was an awkward silence, until: \u0027Harry,\u0027 the Necroscope said at last, his unnatural antagonism colapsing. \u0027Cal me Harry, please. And I\u0027m afraid I have been rude, so don\u0027t you go apologizing. Just recently I\u0027ve been doing more than my fair share of tripping over my tongue!\u0027 And changing the subject: \u0027So what\u0027s in the envelope?\u0027\n Munroe shrugged. \u0027I wasn\u0027t told what\u0027s in here.\u0027 He handed it over, and Harry looked at it with an almost accusing expression. This could be some kind of hook, and him the fish. But on the other hand ... it just might be news of Brenda.\n And as he tore it open: \u0027I imagine Darcy tried to get me on the telephone, right? And when he found he couldn\u0027t get me, then he sent you?\u0027\n \u0027Your listed number?\u0027 Munroe shook his head, and smiled. \u0027But we\u0027re E-Branch, Harry. No such things as listed numbers, not to E-Branch. Darcy Clarke could\n \u0027phone you, if he wanted to. I suppose he\u0027s doing his best to respect your privacy.\u0027\n The Necroscope said, \u0027Huh!\u0027 He took out a single, double-folded sheet of A-4 from the envelope. A leter, probably, but there was something stiff inside it - a photograph, maybe? And because it might be about Brenda, he wanted to open it at once. But because it mightn\u0027t be, he didn\u0027t.\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t make sense,\u0027 he finaly shook his head. \u0027Darcy can get me on the \u0027phone and doesn\u0027t. Or he could just write me a leter, asking me to contact him. But he doesn\u0027t. Instead, he sends you.\u0027 He glanced at the contents of the manila envelope - the leter, or whatever - still folded in his lap. \u0027So what do you reckon, James? Was your journey realy necessary?\u0027\n The other raised a querying eyebrow. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but - \u0027\n \u0027See,\u0027 Harry cut him short. \u0027I\u0027m not going to look at this - this\n whatever it is - until I know why you had to deliver it personaly. In fact, if you don\u0027t tell me, and in the very near future at that, say the next five seconds, I\u0027ll simply set fire to it and dump it in the fireplace there. And you\u0027l have to go back down to London and tell Darcy Clarke what happened.\u0027\n He looked around for his table-lighter, began to stand up, and Munroe said: \u0027Okay! You\u0027re right. Darcy wanted me, or someone, to see you personaly. Yes.\u0027\n Harry sat back again. \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Just to see how you, wel, looked ...\"\n \u0027He\u0027s ... what, worried about me?\u0027\n \u0027Maybe about how you\u0027re taking things. Maybe he feels responsible. Guilty ...\"\n Harry jumped on that. \u0027Guilty? And maybe you\u0027re right. So what would he have to feel guilty about?\u0027\n Munroe shrugged again, perhaps desperately this time, and said, \u0027Harry, I\u0027m just a messenger, that\u0027s al. But Mr Clarke did say he was concerned about your general health. I mean, he knows your problems beter than I do, right? So why don\u0027t you read the leter? Maybe it\u0027s al in there.\u0027\n And in any case, despite his threat to burn it, the Necroscope had to know. So he unfolded the single sheet of A-4, laid the smal envelope inside to one side for the moment, and read what was writen in Darcy Clarke\u0027s spidery script:\n Hary -\n First things first. Still nothing on Brenda, I\u0027m afraid. And I suppose if you had heard anything, you would have told me. Don\u0027t worry, we\u0027re still on it.\n Last time we spoke, you said you were thinking of taking a long holiday, except you were short of funds. So it could be you would take a sort of working holiday?\n You asked if I\u0027d check a few places out for you. Wel, I\u0027ve found a place you might like - in the Mediterranean. The weather would be beneficial I\u0027m sure, and the deal could work out realy cheap ...\n Oh, and you asked about exchange rates? Wel, they are prety good, too. So why don\u0027t you contact me and we\u0027l talk?\n I enclose a photograph. Nice place. I think you\u0027d enjoy working there ...\n Al best -\n Darcy.\n The Necroscope knew what Darcy was talking about; he remembered how he\u0027d suggested doing a job on the Russian repository in Moscow, or maybe on some other outfit or organization in the Branch\u0027s bad books, for monies to fund his search. Damn! Was that all this was? Darcy scratching his back - and maybe hoping to get a job done for free - all the time knowing it would put Harry in his debt, so that at some future time the Necroscope might feel obliged to do a little back-scratching in return? A sort of two-birds-with-one-stone scenario?\n \u0027So why don\u0027t you contact me and we\u0027ll talk?\u0027 - Indeed! E-Branch! It was typical! The nerve of the double-dealing...!\n He almost ripped the photograph from its envelope ... and then sat there frozen, staring at it!\n For a moment Harry thought it must be one of Alec Kyle\u0027s \u0027things\u0027 again, his precognition. Hell! - it was one of Kyle\u0027s things, but this time it was real! As real as this photograph, anyway:\n The stark yellow and white clifs, coloured by sunlight. And the squat, white-walled castle, mansion, chateau, whatever it was, perched there on the edge of oblivion. A fortress on a mountainside, at the rim of a sheer drop. The scene was Mediterranean; yes, of course it was, and Harry had seen it before. All sun-bleached rocks, brittle scrub, a few stunted pines; he could almost taste the salty tang of an unseen ocean.\n Finally he moved, rocked back in his chair, and James Munroe was at his side in a moment. \u0027Harry? Are you okay? I mean, your face. You looked stunned ... \"\n Harry got a grip on himself. He didn\u0027t know what all this meant, but he would soon damn well find out. \u0027I... I\u0027m okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s . , . something you wouldn\u0027t understand.\u0027 Because I don\u0027t understand it! \u0027Look, you get on back to London. Sorry I can\u0027t be more hospitable, but I\u0027ve things to do. Especially now. And don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ve done your job. I\u0027ll be getting in touch with Darcy Clarke and E-Branch, yes.\u0027\n And after he\u0027d seen Munroe off, he did just that...\n The Necroscope could have just telephoned Darcy, but there was a better, almost an easier way. And anyway, face to face Darcy wouldn\u0027t be able to hide too much. That is, assuming there was anything to hide.\n Not so long ago, using the Mobius route to E-Branch would have been much easier, but Harry couldn\u0027t do that now. Part of him realized that Darcy knew all about it anyway, but he still didn\u0027t like the idea that he knew - Darcy or anyone else, for that matter! And so he was restricted in his use of the Continuum; he couldn\u0027t do it in front of people.\n So there was no way he could simply materialize in Darcy\u0027s office.\n But that was all right, for there was another way. Harry doubted if they would have converted his room just yet; Darcy had told him they\u0027d keep it for him just the way it was, even if he never had cause to use it again. So he couldn\u0027t see any reason why he shouldn\u0027t use it now, one last time.\n He did: used it as one of his Mobius co-ordinates -\n - And a moment later stepped out through the door of his old room into the main corridor of E-Branch in central London.\n About half-way to Darcy\u0027s office, situated at the far end of the corridor, two Branch agents were talking to each other. Harry headed their way, and for a moment they scarcely noticed him. But as he passed the open door of the Duty Officer\u0027s room he heard someone say, \u0027Holy shit!\u0027 and guessed he\u0027d been recognized. So, in another five seconds maximum Darcy Clarke would know he was here, too. Then, as he closed with the two espers, they finally saw him, snapped erect as soldiers on parade, and slid to one side out of his way. Harry was aware of their surprised glances, at him and at each other, as he passed by.\n Darcy\u0027s office was full of security gadgets; the Necroscope knew that if he just barged in, he would probably set some of them off. So he went to knock ... but before his fist could strike home the door was yanked open from within.\n And Darcy was there - in his shirt-sleeves, open-mouthed -beckoning him to come in. \u0027Harry! It\u0027s ... really great to see you! In fact I was just talking about you - \u0027\n \u0027 - With Munroe, on his car-phone?\u0027 the Necroscope nodded. \u0027Or with the Duty Officer?\u0027 He tossed Darcy\u0027s letter and photograph down on the Head of E-Branch\u0027s desk. And without further ado: \u0027Would you care to explain this?\u0027\n Darcy moved to close the door. Before he could close it all the way, Harry looked back down the corridor and saw half-a-dozen faces peering from their respective offices. Darcy saw his raised eyebrow and knowing, even scornful expression, gave a shrug and said, \u0027Er, word travels fast around here.\u0027\n \u0027In some cases as fast as thought,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Especially around here!\u0027 He placed extra emphasis on the \u0027esp\u0027 of\n \u0027especially.\u0027 \u0027So how will it be? Can we have some privacy for once? I mean complete privacy?\u0027 He sat down in a chair facing Darcy\u0027s desk. \u0027You have more than your fair share of listening devices around this place, Darcy: gadgets and ghosts and what-al. But your people would do wel to remember how curiosity killed the cat. Maybe the two-legged variety could use a reminder now and then?\u0027\n Darcy sat down in his own chair, flipped a switch on the desk and said, \u0027All stations. We have a guest who\u0027s a personal friend of mine, and of the Branch. You all know who he is, and of course he\u0027s to get the same degree of respect that we give each other. So this is private - and that\u0027s a capital \"P.\" \u0027\n As he switched off again, Harry nodded and said, \u0027Gadgets and ghosts, yes. Machines are easy to switch off. But minds ... are something else, right?\u0027 He glanced about the office. \u0027Well, nothing seems to have changed much around here.\u0027\n \u0027Er ... how\u0027s it going?\u0027 Darcy rubbed his hands in a businesslike fashion. He was lost for words if only for a moment. \u0027So, where have you been, Harry? And for that mater, how have you been?\u0027\n \u0027How do I look?\u0027 The Necroscope was unsmiling.\n \u0027Fine!\u0027 Darcy answered, then slumped and shook his head. \u0027Hey, we\u0027re friends, Harry,\u0027 he said, his tone of voice flattening out a little, losing its bounce. \u0027I\u0027d like to think so, anyway. And in that respect I\u0027m pretty much like Ben Trask: I don\u0027t like to lie.\u0027\n \u0027So don\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027You look about the same as last time,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027You\u0027ve lost weight, gained a few wrinkles, and you seem very tired. But at the same time - I don\u0027t know - somehow you look more like you, too? But you don\u0027t talk like you. I mean, I\u0027ve given a lot of thought to that conversation we had about Alec Kyle - could he have been a secret drinker and so forth? That was pretty strange stuff!\n So, you know, apart from Brenda and the baby ... what is it that\u0027s troubling you, Harry? I mean, I\u0027d realy like to help, if I can.\u0027\n And suddenly the Necroscope felt he could relax a little. Darcy\u0027s friendship was genuine. Oh, there would always be this E-Branch thing, but that aside Darcy was real, and Harry felt able to talk to him. About certain things, anyway. And he did talk to him: Told him about Alec Kyle\u0027s precognition, how he seemed to have inherited it, and something about his strange new problem with drink. He didn\u0027t go into details on the latter, but enough that Darcy got the message. Certainly he got the message on the other thing.\n \u0027About Alec drinking; I still think you\u0027re wrong,\u0027 Darcy said, when Harry was through. \u0027And even if you\u0027re right, it\u0027s amazing to me that he hid it so wel! As for this,\u0027 he picked up the picture from his desk. \u0027You say you\u0027ve seen it before?\u0027\n The Necroscope nodded. \u0027Yes. A scene, or sudden vision - in my head - but absolutely real. Actually, it was during our conversation about a Russian Fort Knox. Do you remember?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, as a result of which I sent you the picture.\u0027\n \u0027Right, but my mind - or maybe Alec Kyle\u0027s mind, the last wrinkle in his grey matter? - had already sent it to me! Only I didn\u0027t recognize it, didn\u0027t know what it meant.\u0027\n Darcy nodded. That\u0027s how it was with Alec, too,\u0027 he said. \u0027He rarely understood anything he saw but simply had to run with his visions to see how they worked out. He had to wait until he caught up with the future.\u0027\n \u0027Me, too,\u0027 Harry said. \u0027Except this time I\u0027ve been given more than just a precognitive glimpse, more than a mental clue.\n I have your photograph, too,\u0027 he leaned forward and tapped his index finger on the picture. \u0027And I know that you know quite a bit about this ... what, target? So I won\u0027t be going in blind, because now that I\u0027m sure this place is waiting to happen to me somewhere in my future, you\u0027l be giving me al the details.\u0027\n \u0027As much as we have,\u0027 Darcy said. \u0027Certainly. But even so, it\u0027s still fait accompli. You are going to do it.\u0027\n \u0027So it would appear,\u0027 Harry\u0027s face was grim. \u0027So maybe we can start with you telling me who it is I\u0027ll be doing it to ...\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-the-lost-years-necroscope-9/page-20.html","bookId":2453,"book":{"id":2453,"title":"Necroscope: The Lost Years (Necroscope #9)","description":"Storyline: \n Necroscope: The Lost Years Volume I (Necroscope #9) \n Vampires never rest, and neither does Harry Keogh, the world\u0027s greatest vampire hunter, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead.
