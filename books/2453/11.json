{"id":80361,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"IV HARRY: WEIRD WARNINGS BONNIE JEAN: SHE WONDERS AND WORRIES Beyond the bay window, low over the distant hills and gleaming palely on the rim of the clouds, the waning moon was five days past full strength. B.J. \u0027s powers - or some of them, such as her metamorphism - had waned with it. But others had been hers from birth; they were hers by right. Her Master\u0027s greatest talents had been his mentalism and, upon a time, his metamorphism, of course; and B.J. was blood of his blood. She would have all that was due to her in the fullness of time ... even if it took another two centuries for full development. But for now - - She was a beguiler. That was her art: hypnotism. Aided by the wine, her eyes and mind would exercise such power even over this awkward subject, this Harry Keogh, that he would become as a toy in her hands: hers to command, to do with as she willed. And because she had never failed, B.J. never once considered the idea of failure. In this she was surely fortunate, for Harry Keogh\u0027s metaphysical mind wasn\u0027t at its best. It resisted the Necroscope\u0027s contours; echoes of Alec Kyle\u0027s precognitive talents continued to shape it; its defences had been undermined by previous tampering. But Bonnie Jean knew none of this. Now, drawing the small table to one side, she positioned her chair so that the chandelier hung just to the right of her head, where its scintillant pendant crystals continued to turn to and fro but on a level with her eyes. And in this position she faced the man on the lounger across eighteen inches to two feet of space, and said, \u0027Harry, now we\u0027ll do something else. When I tell you to, I want you to look into my eyes. Not now, but when I tell you. Is that understood?\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027But it\u0027s still your turn.\u0027 Oh, he had willpower, this man! But so did B.J., and she also had the wine - and powers other than will - to subvert the will of others. \u0027But that game is over now,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027And at my command you will look into my eyes.\u0027 And before he could answer, if he\u0027d intended to: \u0027Harry, this is no longer a \"normal\" conversation. Your mind isn\u0027t yours to control. You feel the effects of the wine. You feel ill as never before. Your brain is swimming. The room is spinning. Only I can stop it. Only my eyes can stop it!\u0027 Harry\u0027s head began to loll on the cushions, to and fro, backwards and forwards. More beads of sweat stood out on his brow, forming damp spots in the permanent creases of forgoten frowns. But his pin-prick pupils never once left the pendants, even though his eyes roled to the motion of his face and head. \u0027You do believe me, don\u0027t you?\u0027 she went on. \u0027You do feel those effects I\u0027ve described?\u0027 In combination with her purring, persuasive voice, the action of the delusion-inducing, suggestion-enhancing wine worked on Harry\u0027s mind to the desired effect. He was pale as death, panting now and beginning to convulse. As rapidly as that, he displayed al the symptoms of physical illness; in a little while he might even be sick! And: Now! thought Bonnie Jean, reaching behind her back to the top of her sheath dress, finding the zipper, drawing it down, down, and shrugging the garment off her shoulders. Let it be now! For a moment the dress clung to her breasts, then fel forward and exposed her to the waist. She stood up, stepped out of the dress as it fel, and pushed down her panties. And once again: Now! Let it be now! This would take some effort; it wasn\u0027t her time; the ful moon was B.J.\u0027s time. But she needed more than her own strength now, more than the strength of her human eyes. Oh, Harry Keogh would listen to her as a woman, and obey her to a point. But as the Other she would be more powerful yet and have complete control over him, or so nearly complete that it wouldn\u0027t mater. And seating herself naked before him, she turned her gaze on the chandelier and let its light fill her brain. It formed a softly glowing moon floating right there in her room, a gloriously full moon. A moon of strange powers, and one of change. And Bonnie Jean ... changed! It was as if her flesh rippled; it was as if her colours flowed, especialy the colour of her hair, out of her head and into her body. The grey highlights were highlights no more but solid colour; she was grey, almost white. Her coat, pelt, fur, was white! And her eyes: their shape was angular now, triangular, or at least framed in triangles of white fur. And their size was huge, and their colour - was blood! And Bonnie Jean\u0027s lips ... her mouth ... her teeth! It was metaplasia, but almost instantaneous. It was metamorphosis, monstrous and immediate. If the Necroscope had been awake, or other than entranced - if he\u0027d seen it, experienced it - then he would have known what it was, would have known to cry out. And the one awesome word he would have cried: 169 Wamphyri! But he hadn\u0027t seen, didn\u0027t know. And the breath he might have felt upon his face, which came from scant inches away now, was still sweet - not with the sweetness of perfume but an animal sweetness, or musk - and the words he heard when she spoke were more a cough, a grunt, a growl, but still her words which he must obey: \u0027My eyes, Harry. Only my eyes. If you would put an end to your sickness, your misery, then look into my eyes. Don\u0027t look at me ... but only into my eyes.\u0027 And he did. Into her furnace gaze, into those eyes which had fascinated Mesmer himself, into a hypnotic whirlpool that was easily the equal of Doctor James Anderson\u0027s; except James Anderson had been here first, and his post-hypnotic commands still applied. They were buried deep, but they were here and they were still active. And: There,\u0027 the creature that was Bonnie Jean husked, binding Harry to her gaze. \u0027And all your pain is eased, your sickness is washed away, the whirling of your brain has been stilled. Now tel me, is it good, Harry?\u0027 The Necroscope tried to answer but couldn\u0027t; his tongue was swollen, his throat parched. But she heard his sigh, and saw how the heaving of his chest gradually subsided. And finally, completely under her spell, he nodded. And his pinprick pupils were like crimson motes burning in the reflection of her gaze, or tiny planets swayed by the lure of twin suns ... In the morning, starting awake from some instantly forgotten nightmare, Harry had a splitting headache and felt like death warmed up. Then he saw where he was, knew that he\u0027d spent the night here without remembering a thing about it (well, except for the really important stuff), and felt even worse. B.J.\u0027s living-room, her lounger ... herself, emerging onto the stairwell landing in a towelling robe. She\u0027d showered and her hair was still damp on her collar. The smells of coffee and toast came wafting from the tray she was carrying. \u0027God!\u0027 said Harry, sitting up and laying aside the blanket she had thrown over him. And he meant it when he repeated: \u0027God!\u0027 For the last time he\u0027d felt like this was on that morning in London, after taking Darcy Clarke\u0027s sleeping pill... She smiled at him where he screwed up his eyes, fingered back his hair and gritted his teeth, and told him: \u0027When you went, you went really fast and never knew what hit you. But I have to admit I asked for it. After all, you\u0027d warned me that you weren\u0027t much of a drinker.\u0027 The wine?\u0027 Harry grunted. That stuff? How can anything that tastes so good be so wicked?\u0027 \u0027But isn\u0027t that always the way is it?\u0027 She laughed at his pained expression. \u0027Anyway, it was either the wine ... or the life of a secret agent is very, very strenuous!\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 he said. \u0027I told you about that?\u0027 (But how much? Had he been that drunk, or ill, or whatever?) \u0027Nothing specific - but I would have known anyway. I mean, you were so calm and controlled in that awful situation in London. You would have to be something special just to be able to get us out of that place the way you did!\u0027 With which most of it came flooding back - or so the Necroscope thought. The words \u0027that awful situation in London\u0027 were a mental trigger, a trip to release his stored \u0027memories.\u0027 And now they were there, dropping neatly into place ... ... Her motive had been revenge pure and simple. Her girls were very special to her, and she felt like a mother to them; in almost every case they\u0027d been in need of care up until the time she employed them. Also, she had known that Skippy was \u0027a bad one.\u0027 If the police weren\u0027t able to pin the murder on him, he might easily put two and two together and work out that B.J. had fingered him. After that, he might even have come looking for her! It seemed like a perfectly sound motive - to the Necroscope, at least. Because B.J. had told him it was sound. And the silvering on the heads of the ornamental crossbow bolts? Perfectly acceptable. Even the odd little chap who had been watching the place: the father of one of the bar\u0027s hostesses, maybe, checking that she worked in a decent place? Or perhaps a private detective following one of B.J. \u0027s more dubious customers? Wel, if she had any more clients like Big Jimmy, that would seem reasonable enough, too! And so his memories seemed whole, complete as some well-remembered tune, and not a single discordant note to jar his mind awake to its errors. As far as last night was concerned, that page of the Necroscope\u0027s mind had been re-written. Maybe he frowned once or twice, and blinked as B.J. sat down beside him and poured coffee, but that was all. Harry\u0027s main concern right now was that he hadn\u0027t been bothersome to his lady host. For after drinking her red wine . . . well, the night\u0027s events were vague, to say the least! \u0027Have you decided, then?\u0027 B.J. broke into his thoughts. Startled, he looked at her. \u0027Decided?\u0027 She nodded, sighed, said, \u0027My, but you\u0027re having a really rough time of it, aren\u0027t you? Have you decided when you\u0027ll continue your search for your wife and baby! It was the very last thing you said to me before you, er, turned in? No, I can see that you don\u0027t remember. You said that you\u0027d have to sleep on it. You told me it could be as early as today. But looking at you this morning ... I can\u0027t say I\u0027d advise you to travel anywhere too far too fast, Harry Keogh!\u0027 Too far too fast.\u0027 The word sequence opened another door in the Necroscope\u0027s mind. Brenda and his son. He had come here to find out if there was a connection between Bonnie Jean and their disappearance. Forlorn hope! No, B.J. was just a strong-willed young woman who believed in taking matters into her own hands. And Harry couldn\u0027t deny that if he\u0027d been in her place he would probably have done pretty much the same thing. An eye for an eye. Her connection therefore was purely coincidental. And despite his false memories, this time Harry was absolutely right: where Brenda was concerned, BJ.\u0027s coming on the scene had been entirely coincidental. So, back to her question. Til think it over - think it out - a while longer,\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, for a couple of weeks, anyway.\u0027 (A couple of weeks? Yes, he was decided. Three weeks at least... to think it out.) And fingering his scalp again: That is, when I can think again! But I\u0027l need at least that long to work out some kind of plan - won\u0027t I?\u0027 She nodded and shrugged. \u0027Well, it\u0027s none of my business, of course. It\u0027s just that I wish you luck. But whatever you do, you will stay in touch, right? Let me know how you get on?\u0027 Harry wasn\u0027t looking at her; he was sitting there holding his head between his hands, blinking his stinging eyes and trying to focus them, looking at his left sock where it hung half off his foot. But her words rang in his mind like a bel: \u0027Stay in touch ... \" He gave a slight involuntary jerk, was unable to stop his reaction, as a short, sharp series of vivid scenes flooded his mind: A full moon, brilliant yellow, like burnished gold, sailing a clear night sky. That was al he should have seen, and he knew it - knew something - remembered something however briefly, like a name on the tip of the tongue that comes ... then slips maddeningly away: \u0027When the moon is nearing its full, stay in touch!\u0027 That was all there should be, yes. But there was more: A snarling visage: the merest glimpse of dripping fangs, salivating leathery lips, pointed ears and grey fur; and commanding eyes, red as sin - ful of sin - carrying some secret message that Harry couldn\u0027t read. Then the moon again, showing the wolfs head in silhouette, thrown back in a silent, throbbing howl! The kaleidoscopic scenes were there ... and they were gone. And even the knowledge that they\u0027d been there was gone, except for a fading shadow on Harry\u0027s metaphysical mind. And of course he jumped to the wrong, or not entirely correct, conclusion: it had to be Alec Kyle, his precognition! But had it been a warning, or what? Or was it simply an echo not of the future but the past, a flashback to the madness and mayhem down in London? And if so, why? But already it was gone ... B.J. had seen him start; he could feel her watching him. He jerked up his head and looked at her, catching her off balance. There was a smile on her face - or the vestiges of one - that she hadn\u0027t quite managed to drop. And knowing she\u0027d been caught out, as it were, she shook her head and said: \u0027So there we have it: no drinking man, you, Harry! Man, ye\u0027re rough!\u0027 So, she\u0027d been smiling at his discomfort - right? But a very secretive sort of smile. Or maybe a knowing smile? Again Harry jumped to the wrong conclusion: B.J. must see a good many heavy drinkers in her bar. Alcoholics even. Let\u0027s face it, you could find alcoholics in just about any bar anywhere in the world. Couldn\u0027t you? The trouble was the Necroscope didn\u0027t know much about them. Only what he\u0027d heard. For instance: one drink is enough for some people, while others can drink all night and never show it for a moment. What kind of drinker had Alec Kyle been, really? A heavy one, maybe? Too heavy? A secret one? Secret enough to hold down his job at E-Branch? And here was Harry Keogh, lumbered with Kyle\u0027s body. And his addiction? He looked at the tray where B.J. had set it on the pine table. The coffee looked good but he really didn\u0027t fancy anything to eat. His throat was sandpaper-dry and his brain felt like a wet sponge! But Bonnie Jean had asked him a question. God, he felt so stupid! What was it she\u0027d asked? \u0027Won\u0027t I be seeing you again?\u0027 She obliged him. \u0027I... I have your number,\u0027 he told her. \u0027I\u0027ll know where to contact you.\u0027 (But why in hell would he want to contact her, apart from the obvious reason? What arrangements had been made last night? He was sure that nothing had happened here.) Mulling it over, he drank his coffee ... \u0027 Half an hour later he left, walking off along the street into a dreary morning. And not long after that one of B.J. \u0027s girls reported back to her and said: \u0027I followed him, like you said. But... I lost him!\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 B.J. was angry. She had obtained Harry\u0027s telephone number but that was all. It was a simple oversight, an error on her part. She\u0027d wanted to know where he lived, how to get there and what it looked like - things that she could have asked him last night. It had seemed such a perfect coincidence: the fact that he had a place up here close to Edinburgh! But she\u0027d known that Harry would \u0027stay in touch\u0027 with her, and so hadn\u0027t really considered the possibility that he might be hard to locate. She had only sent the girl after him on an afterthought. Now, however, taking time to give it a little more thought: Harry was (or had been) some kind of agent. What if this place of his wasn\u0027t \u0027his\u0027 place at all but a safe house? Perhaps it was a good thing her girl had lost him. Perhaps these \u0027people\u0027 of his had been waiting for him, to whistle him away, and the telephone number was merely a contact number. She knew it was listed, which meant she couldn\u0027t use it to discover his address. All very irritating! And because the girl hadn\u0027t answered her yet: \u0027How could you lose him?\u0027 she snapped. \u0027He went into a newsagent\u0027s,\u0027 the girl told her hurriedly. \u0027I thought he\u0027d be buying a newspaper and waited in my car. But he didn\u0027t come back out.\u0027 \u0027Maybe he\u0027d spotted you!\u0027 BJ. snapped. \u0027I told you to be careful. He\u0027s no fool, that one.\u0027 \u0027I thought I was careful,\u0027 the girl looked bewildered. B.J.\u0027s attitude softened, and finally she said, \u0027Maybe he went out the back way.\u0027 And she left it at that. For after all, Harry was that kind of man. And in his line of work it must be second nature to take precautions against being tailed. Indeed, he had said as much. He was just good at his job, that was all. Again she remembered that damp, dangerous night in London: the action in the garage, and how ... something had happened to her, before she came to her senses in the alley; then how Harry had seemed to disappear into the mist. Oh, yes, he\u0027d been good at his job, all right! But in any case, what difference did it make? For BJ. knew he would be in touch again, and even when he would be in touch: in just three weeks\u0027 time. Glad to be let off the hook, B.J. \u0027s girl went down to tidy up in the bar room. For in fact she, too, was lost for an explanation as to how she had so stupidly, even ridiculously, lost her target. Because as far as she knew - having checked and double-checked - the newsagent\u0027s shop in question didn\u0027t have any back way out! Harry\u0027s coat was of the voluminous variety, a big heavy thing that John Wayne might have worn in some wintry Western. Shrugging out of it in the old house near Bonnyrig, he became aware of an oblong shape swelling out the left-hand side pocket, and of extra weight on that side. He would have noticed it sooner, except he wasn\u0027t up to noticing much of anything this morning. It was a small, flat bottle of B.J.\u0027s wine; no label, but the same unmistakable red, and loaded with sediment. A gift, obviously. What, from B.J. ? But after last night anyone would think she\u0027d know better. Red wine and Harry Keogh didn\u0027t mix! Maybe she\u0027d simply dumped it on him before someone else suffered the consequences. Well, cheers, B.J.! He gave it no further consideration ... because he\u0027d been told not to. There was something else that B.J. hadn\u0027t mentioned about her \u0027Greek\u0027 wine: the fact that it was savagely addictive, far more so than any cocaine derivative. But even if the Necroscope had,known, right then he wouldn\u0027t have been able to so much as look at the stuff. Not yet, anyway ... It was mid-morning, and Harry was stil tired; he had a stiff neck from B.J.\u0027s lounger, not to mention a hellish hangover. Taking aspirins, he tried to think straight. There were things he had to do this morning - if only he could remember what they were! But - - Call your superiors. The people you worked for. Get me of the hook. We don\u0027t want them carrying out any unnecessary investigations on an innocent girl, now do we? No, of course not. But. . . Bonnie Jean wasn\u0027t on the hook, was she? They didn\u0027t even-know about her! Even as these pseudomemories and thoughts crossed his mind, Harry had picked up the \u0027phone and dialled Darcy\u0027s number. It was a Saturday, but still Darcy might be in his office. And he was. \u0027Harry? What can I do for you?\u0027 And more quickly: \u0027If it\u0027s about Brenda, I\u0027m sorry, but - \u0027 \u0027No, it\u0027s something else,\u0027 the Necroscope cut in. And now he knew what it really was about. \u0027Darcy, check and see if the police down there have an unsolved murder on their hands, won\u0027t you? An Edinburgh girl or young woman, murdered in London about a year ago? If they have, you can tell them the case is closed. Tell them it was down to Skippy or our would-be werewolf - or both of them.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re still working on that?\u0027 \u0027No, it was just something that came up.\u0027 \u0027Oh. Well, thanks anyway.\u0027 \u0027Oh, and you remember the silvering on the heads on those crossbow bolts? Well, it was ornamental. They once decorated a wall over a fireplace in a hunting lodge or something. The silver was to stop them from rusting.\u0027 \u0027You have been working on it!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Harry sighed. \u0027Just checking back on everything that was going on at that time, that\u0027s all. The time when Brenda and my son ... you know.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 said Darcy. And: \u0027Well, thanks again, Harry.\u0027 \u0027Also,\u0027 the Necroscope blurted, before Darcy could put the \u0027phone down, \u0027you might be able to tell me something more about Alec Kyle.\u0027 \u0027If I know, I\u0027ll tell you,\u0027 Darcy answered. \u0027I asked you if he liked a drink. You told me he wasn\u0027t a heavy drinker, but that when he did take a nip, then he really went to town on it.\u0027 That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027Could he have had a problem that you didn\u0027t know about? I mean, is it possible he was an alcoholic and knew it, but he had it more or less under control? Except on occasion, when it would break out and he\u0027d have to feed it? Wait! Don\u0027t give me your answer right off but give it a moment\u0027s thought. It could be very important, and I know how loyal you are, Darcy ... \" Several seconds ticked by, then the other said: \u0027Well, it is possible, of course. In this game I\u0027ve come to realize that almost anything is possible! But I wouldn\u0027t have thought so. I never knew a steadier man, Harry. On the other hand ... he was a precog, as you know. They all have this thing about the future; they\u0027re all a little scared of it - and sometimes a lot. If, and I mean if, Alec had a problem, he kept it pretty wel hid. And if he had one, you can bet your last penny it would have to do with his talent. \"Talent\": that\u0027s a laugh! I sometimes wonder if we\u0027re not all cursed!\u0027 Harry thought about that, then said, Thanks, Darcy.\u0027 \u0027No, it\u0027s me, we, us, who should be thanking you,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027You\u0027re welcome,\u0027 Harry answered, automatically, and he started to put the \u0027phone down - then paused and said: \u0027Darcy, I\u0027ll be up here for maybe three more weeks, then I\u0027ll probably be out of the country. I think they must have gone abroad. But when I go ... I may be gone a while. I mean, I won\u0027t be coming back here each night. And I\u0027ll need funds.\u0027 \u0027I can swing that,\u0027 Darcy told him, without hesitation. \u0027No,\u0027 Harry answered, \u0027I\u0027m not going to hit on you or E-Branch for money. But there is something you can do for me.\u0027 \u0027Just mention it.\u0027 \u0027Find out where the Russians keep their gold.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 (Astonishment). \u0027Where the Russians - ?\u0027 \u0027I mean, their repository? Like Fort Knox or something?\u0027 As the last word fell from his lips, so Harry reeled. It was as if for a single second he was no longer in his room. It was just like that time in Darcy\u0027s office, in the moment folowing the warning of an imminent IRA attack. Except this time nothing had prompted it, there was nothing to explain why - - Why Harry stood in the open, somewhere else, in bright daylight, and craned his neck to look up, and up, at stark yellow and white clifs .. . and at the squat, white-walled castle, mansion, or chateau that was perched there on the edge of oblivion. A fortress on a mountainside (from Harry\u0027s viewpoint), at the very rim of a sheer drop that must be all of twelve hundred metres to the sloping scree of a rubble-strewn gorge. The scene was ... Mediterranean? All sun-bleached rocks, brittle scrub, a few stunted pines, and a salty tang from the unseen ocean. Their repository?\u0027 Darcy answered, abruptly yanking the Necro-scope back to the here and now. \u0027Why, I\u0027m sure they must have! And I can probably find out about it, yes. But - \u0027 Harry quickly pulled himself together. It could only have been a manifestation of Alec Kyle\u0027s precognition. As to what it meant. . . who could say? He tried to carry on the conversation as if nothing had happened. \u0027Or if not the Russians, someone or some outfit - maybe the Mafia, or some other organization like that, with bullion - who you\u0027d like to see lose some big money? Maybe to our advantage? Like, gunrunners, or drug traffickers? I\u0027m sure you know what I\u0027m saying.\u0027 Darcy laughed out loud ... but the Necroscope didn\u0027t even chuckle; he was still recovering from the effects of his inexplicable - what, visitation? Finally the head of E-Branch said, \u0027Ahem! You know, if I didn\u0027t know better, Harry, I might accuse you of planning something decidedly ilegal?\u0027 \u0027I suppose it depends whose side you\u0027re on. You\u0027ll do it?\u0027 \u0027If that\u0027s what you want, yes,\u0027 Darcy said. Harry nodded, despite that the other couldn\u0027t see him, and said, Then do it soon. And Darcy - see if you can find someone who\u0027l give us a decent exchange rate, no questions asked.\u0027 This time, putting the \u0027phone down, Harry was smiling despite his headache. Because he knew that on the other end of the line, Darcy Clarke wasn\u0027t. But even as the \u0027phone settled in its cradle - - He was there again! But this time he was up there on the rim of the clif, and the walls of the keep rising before him. Its medieval turret towers seemed semi-sentient - like stone sentinels - where he craned his neck to look up at them. And he felt his hair moving on his head, perhaps blown by the winds of the gorge. It came and it went, and Harry sat there beside the telephone again. With his hair still standing on end ... Bonnie Jean was worried. About E-Branch: how successful she\u0027d been in throwing Harry, or \u0027them\u0027, off her trail.\u0027 About Harry Keogh himself, because she believed there was still something about that one that wasn\u0027t connecting. Where he was concerned, no sooner was one mystery cleared up than another surfaced! Like how he moved so quickly and came and went the way he did, and the way he had eluded her tracker. As to the matter of his drugging her that night at the garage in London - the more she considered that, the more utterly ridiculous it seemed! But any alternative was even more ridiculous, indeed impossible! So it could only be true. If only she had been a little more thorough when he was in her power. She could have discovered a lot more about this E-Branch he\u0027d worked for, for one thing ... And as if all of this weren\u0027t worrying enough, now there was the question of the watcher. A detective, or the father of one of Bonnie Jean\u0027s girls? She thought not. But from the description Harry Keogh had given her, B.J. believed she knew who - or what - it might be. Well, it had happened before, on several occasions down the decades. And now it could be happening again. She supposed she should be grateful Harry had brought it to her attention, except grateful wasn\u0027t part of the equation. But forewarned is forearmed. If indeed this should prove to be the worst possible scenario come or coming to pass, then B.J. must look into it and, if necessary, draw their fire away from her Master. She had done it before - all of a hundred and seventy-five years ago - to lure them from the true spoor; and twice more in the years flown between. Inexperienced though she had been on that first occasion, still she\u0027d won; and likewise ever since, else she wouldn\u0027t be here now! It was why she was here, after all; to guard over the dog-Lord in His immemorial sleep, where He patiently awaited the advent of the One Foreseen, the Mysterious One. The right one, aye. And yet again BJ. thought of Harry Keogh, if only for a moment ... ... And the time of the calling so close now, when again she must go to Him. But this watcher: If he (or they) were that close, and if they had been allowed to follow B.J., all unbeknown, perhaps to the very lair? That was unthinkable -that she might so easily have betrayed a secret so well-kept for six long centuries! Well, at least it excluded Keogh\u0027s involvement with them. ! For if he were one of them he never would have offered his help in the first place. And when he had her under the influence of his drug, he ! could have done whatever he wanted with her; could have ... removed \\ her, and so dealt with her Master, too. For without BJ. what was her Master but a poor defenceless thing in a cavern tomb? But Harry had done nothing except bring her to safety. But oh, what she wouldn\u0027t give for Harry Keogh\u0027s extraordinary skills now! The way he seemed simply to vanish like that. Why, with him on her side, B.J. would have nothing to fear during the coming visit to her Master! Harry would lose any would-be trackers as easily as he\u0027d eluded her girl. With him on her side ... or, him by her side? Keogh ... Keogh ... Keogh! Why was he on her mind so? For after al she, Bonnie Jean Mirlu, was the beguiler, with the power of fascination! And yet somehow this Keogh fascinated her ... Oh? And did that mean something? His eyes, so warm and innocent: neither brooding, conniving, nor flirting (or flirting only a very little); not even especially beautiful, yet extraordinary in their depth, in the way they echoed the soul behind them. They were oh so soulful, those eyes of his. And at that B.J. gave an involuntary shiver, for the thought of his soul was . . . delicious! And if her Master were to give the word, why, she might yet taste it, steal it from him in one raw red moment! Aye, and that would put an end to his mysterious ways, for sure. His mysterious ways ... ? Bonnie Jean started into shocked awareness where she sat thinking things out and brooding in a chair in her living-room. Harry Keogh: a mystery man appearing on the scene from nowhere, as if on cue. And BJ. feeling this attraction, a weird affinity that was hard to place, as if she already knew him. So much so that when she should have let him be killed - or killed him herself - instead she\u0027d entrusted herself to him! Then, later, he had sought her out, to bring her a warning. This mysterious Harry Keogh. What was she thinking? That he might actually be that mysterious one, the Mysterious One, for whom the dog-Lord waited? And if he was, and she had simply let him walk out of here ... ? Bonnie Jean had lived too long to panic, but for a moment that\u0027s what it felt like. Then logic took over. So Harry Keogh had come and gone ... so what? He would be back, and she knew he would be back -whenever she called! Through her hypnotism, her fascination, he was now as much in thrall to her as she was to her sleeping Master. Except he didn\u0027t know it yet and probably never would. She could be with him -use him, deal with him, however she chose - and afterwards he would remember only what she required him to remember. Her immediate instinct, to call him on the telephone - now, at once -gradually eased. He was at her beck and call, and not the other way around! And anyway, he wasn\u0027t going anywhere for at least three weeks. And when he did he\u0027d be going with B.J., to see her Master. Yes, and then all would be well. If by some miracle Harry should prove to be the one, then she would reap her reward: her Master\u0027s eternal gratitude. And if he was not the one, still she would be rewarded, and the dog-Lord\u0027s most urgent need satisfied. For it would also be the time of replenishment, the time of nourishment. Bonnie Jean\u0027s time, too, as well as that of her Lord and Master and ancestor, the dog-Lord Radu Lykan ...! Meanwhile, she would put a watch on the watcher, and perhaps discover who or what he was. Using her girls, it would be an easy thing to arrange a roster of observers - a stake-out? - on the street outside the wine bar. A tiny garret window in BJ.\u0027s bedroom looked out over the rooftops, but could just as easily look down across the street into the very doorway where Harry had seen him. A person might sit there, unseen and unsuspected behind the window\u0027s net curtains all day long, and keep watch on the street. All night long, too, if B.J. desired it. Then, if someone was watching the place, and if he should be a terrible someone, B.J. would soon know about it. And the next time one of her girls followed someone, be sure she would not lose him! She would not dare lose him! Not for her life. Not for all their lives ... It was that same afternoon. Some miles away in the study of his house outside Bonnyrig, the Necroscope Harry Keogh sat absorbed in - and occasionally nodding over - the list of faraway places which he\u0027d spent hours compiling in the reading room of a local library. His \u0027system\u0027 had been elementary, and flawed: Take a modern World Atlas and track the lines of longitude west from the north-eastern region of the British Isles to discover areas of similar climatic characteristics and habitability in the rest of the world; not forgetting the west coast of England itself, of course, but with all coastal regions given the same priority. The idea sprang from what his Ma had said, and what he had later thought: that Brenda might have found this place, Bonnyrig, ideally suited to her personality. From which Harry had gone several steps further, extrapolating an imaginary - yet persistently \u0027real\u0027 - world or place of dramatic scenery, misted nights, slanting sunlit days, long grasses, leaning trees and wild flowers. Indeed, a vast garden run wild, all hidden away from the eyes of men. Hidden from Harry\u0027s eyes, anyway. So where to find such a place? And would the climate prove to be similar along the same lines of longitude? For the imagined scene - at least with regard to its weather patterns - wasn\u0027t especially dissimilar to the north-east coastal region of Brenda\u0027s childhood. And the Necroscope had simply extended that region one hundred and fifty miles north to take in Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth. And Bonnyrig, of course. It gave him a band round the Earth bordered by lines of longitude 55 and 56 North, including parts of Antrim, Donegal, and Londonderry in Northern Ireland; which was something that Harry hadn\u0027t previously considered - that Brenda and his baby son could be as close as Ireland. It had given him pause, but not as much as the discovery that if he followed the same lines east, they would also enclose Moscow, several thousands of miles of frozen tundra, the Bering Sea, and Alaska!? Which would seem to put paid to that theory, at least. And Harry had shaken his head and grinned, however wrily, thinking himself a fool that he hadn\u0027t paid more attention in school. If only his knowledge of the world\u0027s geography was as good as his understanding of maths! But there again, the Necroscope\u0027s amazing skill with numbers had very little to do with his education. Nothing he\u0027d learned from the living, anyway ... It was then, as he tossed his pencilled list aside to let his head loll against the back of his easy chair, that the telephone rang. Harry sat up, reached for the telephone on the occasional table, paused and frowned. B.J.\u0027s bottle of red wine was there, beside the telephone where he\u0027d set it down. And the Necroscope was thirsty. He - or Alec Kyle\u0027s body - was thirsty. His eyes stung like there was a pound or two of grit in them; his throat hurt as if someone had wire-brushed it on the inside; his mind felt equally desiccated, dried out. And somehow he knew that a sip of the wine, just a sip, would ease everything and he\u0027d be able to face up to things. But face up to what things? Just a moment ago he had seemed okay, and now ... ? For his life, Harry couldn\u0027t say why he had frozen like that, with his hand stretching halfway to the \u0027phone. But the room was suddenly darker, as if a storm was about to break. Or maybe it was just the grimy patio windows; he hadn\u0027t found the time or energy to clean them, and what litle light forced its way in from the overgrown garden was usually grey. The telephone rang again, insistently, drawing his hand just a few inches closer, to where it hovered nervously above the top of the dusty table. Yet still he held back from picking up the \u0027phone. He felt a chill on or in his back, as if a cold wind was blowing along the marrow of his spine, and shivered uncontrollably. In the last few seconds it was as if the whole room had gone cold as the grave! Now what the hell... ? Pick it up, idiot! he heard his own voice demanding from deep inside his head. Pick up the damn telephone! What in the world\u0027s wrong with you? But he wasn\u0027t expecting a call, was he? Or was he? There was something he should remember about the telephone, but when he went to think about it, it kept giving him the slip. Like a word on the tip of his tongue that he simply couldn\u0027t remember. And his brain was fuzzy from all the planning he was ... well, supposed to be doing! Was he expecting a call? Maybe he was, but not yet, surely? And what call was it anyway? The \u0027phone rang yet again, and this time - despite that he knew it was coming - it caused him to start in his chair. So why not pick the fucking thing up, answer it and find out? But find out what? Something that he really wouldn\u0027t want to know? Maybe. And what had made him think that, anyway? Questions, questions! And nothing in his head but a ball of fluff, or rather a tangle of barbed wire. His stinging eyes ... his sore throat ... and B.J.\u0027s bottle of red wine sitting there oh-so-temptingly ... and the - Rrrr-iiiing!... Rrrr-iiiing! - Damned telephone! Harry went for it, curled his fingers around it, picked it up ... and the room went dark as night, so that he knew it had to be a storm. Now the thunder! he thought. Now the lightning! But the thunder and lightning never came. Something else came. Almost involuntarily, Harry tightened his grip on the fur ruff of the telephone as he drew it from its cradle towards his face ... the telephone that wasn\u0027t. He drew it at first, but in the next moment it was drawing him! A straining, bristling ruff that dragged on his arm as if he was walking an unruly brute of a dog. And he simply couldn\u0027t believe his eyes as he looked at his hand and saw what it was holding in check, but barely: Not a dog, but a snarling, coughing, choking wolfs head, red-eyed with feral yellow pupils! The thing didn\u0027t have a body but grew out of the telephone\u0027s speaker. And the cable was like a leash that lashed with the living head\u0027s frantic motion, then stretched itself taut as the awful thing it anchored strained on it, turning Harry\u0027s arm inwards towards his gasping, utterly astonished mouth! The head was trying to get at him, bite him, crush his face in its slavering, fetid mantrap jaws! \u0027Almighty G-God!\u0027 Harry gasped, tightening his fist to a knot in the ruff of coarse fur, trying to force the head back while bringing his left hand into play as he fought to protect his face. The wolfs gaping, snarling muzzle was black leather flecked with white foam; its unbelievable teeth were ivory yellow; its ears lay flat to its head, seeming to streamline the horror of its intentions as they pointed the whole gnashing, clashing monstrosity of a visage at the Necroscope. Then - - That tunnel of teeth closing on Harry\u0027s flapping left hand, where he felt bones snap in at least three of his fingers, and the searing agony of flesh severed, shorn through! And paws as big as his hands were elongating themselves out of the telephone\u0027s speaker, followed by a long grey slime-damp body, as if the telephone was giving birth to this Thing! And the jaws were clashing inches from his face; they slopped blood and bits of mangled, twitching finger! And the grey fur of the beast\u0027s ruff tearing in his right hand, coming out in scurvy, matted tufts! He ... he couldn\u0027t hold it off! And worst of all, the intelligence in those yellow-cored, murderous, oh-so-knowing eyes, as the red-ribbed throat of the monster expanded to engulf his face, his head! Harry screamed gurglingly but unashamedly, thrusting himself back so spastically, with such force in his driving legs, as to topple his chair over backwards. And as if from a million miles away, the heavy pattering of raindrops on glass, and a flash of lightning at last. Then thunder clattering mightily close by, and a gust of wind hurling open the patio doors. Harry\u0027s Ma came rushing in through the doors, crying: Harry! Good God, son ... what sort of a dream was that!? And his Ma was all mud and bones and weed, but that was okay because it was how she had always been. But he also knew she shouldn\u0027t be here, that she wasn\u0027t here except... except in his head ... ? Harry? And, \u0027Ma!\u0027 he gasped, panted, choked, where he lay sprawled on the floor, with the rain hissing in his face, and a wind howling from the garden, whirling his pages of loose-leaf notepaper in a dervish dance all around the room. Dream? Of course it had been a dream! But had she really needed to ask what sort? \u0027A nightmare, Ma,\u0027 he told her, where her drowned spirit lay deep in mud and weeds in a bight in the river that was her grave. \u0027A f-fucking godawful n-n-nightmare!\u0027 For the first (and probably the last) time in his life, the Necroscope Harry Keogh had uttered a curse word in the presence of his beloved Ma.
