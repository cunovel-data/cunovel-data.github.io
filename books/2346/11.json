{"id":66276,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"I drove the Humvee back to my office. Left it parked right outside my door. The sergeant with the baby son had gone. The small dark corporal who I thought was from Louisiana was there in her place. The coffeepot was cold and empty. There were two message slips on my desk. The first was: Major Franz called. Please call him back. The second said: Detective Clark returned your call. I dialed Franz in California first.\n \"Reacher?\" he said. \"I asked about the Armored agenda.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"There wasn\u0027t one. That\u0027s their story, and they\u0027re sticking to it.\"\n \"But?\"\n \"We both know that\u0027s bullshit. There\u0027s always an agenda.\"\n \"So did you get anywhere?\"\n \"Not really,\" he said. \"But I can prove an incoming secure fax from Germany late on December thirtieth, and I can prove significant Xeroxing activity on the thirty-first, in the afternoon. And then there was some shredding and burning on New Year\u0027s Day, after the Kramer news broke. I spoke to the incinerator guy. One burn bag, full of paper shreds, maybe enough for about sixty sheets.\"\n \"How secure is their secure fax line?\"\n \"How secure do you want it to be?\"\n \"Extremely secure. Because the only way I can make sense out of this is if the agenda was really secret. I mean, really secret. And if it was really secret, would they have put it on paper in the first place?\"\n \"They\u0027re XII Corps, Reacher. They\u0027ve been living on the front line for forty years. All they\u0027ve got is secrets.\"\n \"How many people were scheduled to attend the conference?\"\n \"I spoke to the mess. There were fifteen bag lunches booked.\"\n \"Sixty pages, fifteen people, that\u0027s a four-page agenda, then.\"\n \"Looks that way. But they went up in smoke.\"\n \"Not the original that was faxed from Germany,\" I said.\n \"They\u0027ll have burned that one over there.\"\n \"No, my guess is Kramer was hand-carrying it when he died.\"\n \"So where is it now?\"\n \"Nobody knows. It got away.\"\n \"Is it worth chasing?\"\n \"Nobody knows,\" I said again. \"Except the guy who wrote it, and he\u0027s dead. And Vassell and Coomer. They must have seen it. They probably helped with it.\"\n \"Vassell and Coomer went back to Germany. This morning. First flight out of Dulles. The staffers here were talking about it.\"\n \"You ever met this new guy Willard?\" I asked him.\n \"No.\"\n \"Try not to. He\u0027s an asshole.\"\n \"Thanks for the warning. What did we do to deserve him?\"\n \"I have no idea,\" I said. We hung up and I dialed the Virginia number and asked for Detective Clark. I got put on hold. Then I heard a click and a second\u0027s worth of squad room sounds and a voice came on the line.\n \"Clark,\" it said.\n \"Reacher,\" I said. \"U.S. Army, down at Fort Bird. Did you want me?\"\n \"You wanted me, as I recall,\" Clark said. \"You wanted a progress report on Mrs. Kramer. But there isn\u0027t any progress. We\u0027re looking at a brick wall here. We\u0027re looking for help, actually.\"\n \"Nothing I can do. It\u0027s your case.\"\n \"I wish it wasn\u0027t,\" he said.\n \"What have you got?\"\n \"Lots of nothing. The perp was in and out without maybe touching a thing. Gloves, obviously. There was a light frost on the ground. We\u0027ve got some residual grit from the driveway and the path, but we\u0027re not even close to a footprint.\"\n \"Neighbors see anything?\"\n \"Most of them were out, or drunk. It was New Year\u0027s Eve. I\u0027ve had people up and down the street canvassing, but nothing\u0027s jumping out at me. There were some cars around, but there would be anyway, on New Year\u0027s Eve, with folks heading back and forth to parties.\"\n \"Any tire tracks on the driveway?\"\n \"None that mean anything.\"\n I said nothing.\n \"The victim was killed with a crowbar,\" Clark said. \"Probably the same tool as was used on the door.\"\n \"I figured that,\" I said.\n \"After the attack the perp wiped it on the rug and then washed it clean in the kitchen sink. We found stuff in the pipe. No prints on the faucet. Gloves, again.\"\n I said nothing.\n \"Something else we haven\u0027t got,\" Clark said. \"There\u0027s nothing much to say your general ever really lived there.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"We gave it the full-court press, forensically. We printed the whole place, we took hair and fiber from everywhere including the sink and shower traps, like I said. Everything belonged to the victim except a couple of stray prints. Bingo, we thought, but the database brought them back as the husband\u0027s. And the ratio of hers to his suggests he was hardly there over the last five years or so. Is that usual?\"\n \"He\u0027ll have stayed on-post a lot,\" I said. \"But he should have been home for the holidays every year. The story here is that the marriage wasn\u0027t so great.\"\n \"People like that should just go ahead and get divorced,\" Clark said. \"I mean, that\u0027s not a deal-breaker even for a general, right?\"\n \"Not that I\u0027ve heard,\" I said. \"Not anymore.\"\n Then he went quiet for a minute. He was thinking.\n \"How bad was the marriage?\" he asked. \"Bad enough that we should be looking at the husband for the doer?\"\n \"The timing doesn\u0027t work,\" I said. \"He was dead when it happened.\"\n \"Was there money involved?\"\n \"Nice house,\" I said. \"Probably hers.\"\n \"So what about a paid hit, maybe set up way ahead of time?\"\n Now he was really clutching at straws.\n \"He\u0027d have arranged it for when he was away in Germany.\"\n Clark said nothing to that.\n \"Who called you for this progress report?\" I asked him.\n \"You did,\" he said. \"An hour ago.\"\n \"I don\u0027t recall doing that.\"\n \"Not you personally,\" he said. \"Your people. It was the little black chick I met at the scene. Your lieutenant. I was too busy to talk. She gave me a number, but I left it somewhere. So I called back on the number you gave me originally. Did I do wrong?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"You did fine. Sorry we can\u0027t help you.\"\n We hung up. I sat quiet for a moment and then I buzzed my corporal.\n \"Ask Lieutenant Summer to come see me,\" I said.\n Summer showed up inside ten minutes. She was in BDUs and between her face and her body language I could see she was feeling a little nervous of me and a little contemptuous of me all at the same time. I let her sit down and then I launched right into it.\n \"Detective Clark called back,\" I said.\n She said nothing.\n \"You disobeyed my direct order,\" I said.\n She said nothing.\n \"Why?\" I asked.\n \"Why did you give me the order?\"\n \"Why do you think?\"\n \"Because you\u0027re toeing Willard\u0027s line.\"\n \"He\u0027s the CO,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a good line to toe.\"\n \"I don\u0027t agree.\"\n \"You\u0027re in the army now, Summer. You don\u0027t obey orders just because you agree with them.\"\n \"We don\u0027t cover things up just because we\u0027re told to either.\"\n \"We do,\" I said. \"We do that all the time. We always have.\"\n \"Well, we shouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Who made you Chief of Staff?\"\n \"It\u0027s unfair to Carbone and Mrs. Kramer,\" she said. \"They\u0027re innocent victims.\"\n I paused. \"Why did you start with Mrs. Kramer? You see her as more important than Carbone?\"\n Summer shook her head. \"I didn\u0027t start with Mrs. Kramer. I got to her second. I had already started on Carbone. I went through the personnel lists and the gate log and marked who was here at the time and who wasn\u0027t.\"\n \"You gave me that paperwork.\"\n \"I copied it first.\"\n \"You\u0027re an idiot,\" I said.\n \"Why? Because I\u0027m not chicken?\"\n \"How old are you?\"\n \"Twenty-five.\"\n \"OK,\" I said. \"So next year you\u0027ll be twenty-six. You\u0027ll be a twenty-six-year-old black woman with a dishonorable discharge from the only career you\u0027ve ever had. Meanwhile the civilian job market will be flooded because of force reduction and you\u0027ll be competing with people with chests full of medals and pockets full of testimonials. So what are you going to do? Starve? Go work up at the strip club with Sin?\"\n She said nothing.\n \"You should have left it to me,\" I said.\n \"You weren\u0027t doing anything.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you thought so,\" I said. \"That was the plan.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to take Willard on,\" I said. \"It\u0027s going to be him or me.\"\n She said nothing.\n \"I work for the army,\" I said. \"Not for Willard. I believe in the army. I don\u0027t believe in Willard. I\u0027m not going to let him trash everything.\"\n She said nothing.\n \"I told him not to make an enemy out of me. But he didn\u0027t listen.\"\n \"Big step,\" she said.\n \"One that you already took,\" I said.\n \"Why did you cut me out?\"\n \"Because if I blow it I don\u0027t want to take anyone down with me.\"\n \"You were protecting me.\"\n I nodded.\n \"Well, don\u0027t,\" she said. \"I can think for myself.\"\n I said nothing.\n \"How old are you?\" she asked.\n \"Twenty-nine,\" I said.\n \"So next year you\u0027ll be thirty. You\u0027ll be a thirty-year-old white man with a dishonorable discharge from the only job you\u0027ve ever had. And whereas I\u0027m young enough to start over, you\u0027re not. You\u0027re institutionalized, you\u0027ve got no social skills, you\u0027ve never been in the civilian world, and you\u0027re good for nothing. So maybe it should be you laying in the weeds, not me.\"\n I said nothing.\n \"You should have talked it over,\" she said.\n \"It\u0027s a personal choice,\" I said.\n \"I already made my personal choice,\" she said. \"Seems like you know that now. Seems like Detective Clark accidentally ratted me out.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly what I mean,\" I said. \"One stray phone call and you could be out on the street. This is a high-stakes game.\"\n \"And I\u0027m right here in it with you, Reacher. So bring me up to speed.\"\n Five minutes later she knew what I knew. All questions, no answers.\n \"Garber\u0027s signature was a forgery,\" she said.\n I nodded.\n \"So what about Carbone\u0027s, on the complaint? Is that forged too?\"\n \"Maybe,\" I said. I took the copy that Willard had given me out of my desk drawer. Smoothed it out on the blotter and passed it across to her. She folded it neatly and put it in her inside pocket.\n \"I\u0027ll get the writing checked,\" she said. \"Easier for me than you, now.\"\n \"Nothing\u0027s easy for either of us now,\" I said. \"You need to be very clear about that. So you need to be very clear about what you\u0027re doing.\"\n \"I\u0027m clear,\" she said. \"Bring it on.\"\n I sat quiet for a minute. Just looked at her. She had a small smile on her face. She was plenty tough. But then, she had grown up poor in an Alabama shack with churches burning and exploding all around her. I guessed watching her back against Willard and a bunch of Delta vigilantes might represent progress, of a sort, in her life.\n \"Thank you,\" I said. \"For being on my side.\"\n \"I\u0027m not on your side,\" she said. \"You\u0027re on mine.\"\n My phone rang. I picked it up. It was the Louisiana corporal, calling from his desk outside my door.\n \"North Carolina State Police on the line,\" he said. \"They want a duty officer. You want to take it?\"\n \"Not really,\" I said. \"But I guess I better.\"\n There was a click and some dead air and another click. Then a dispatcher came on the line and told me a trooper in an I-95 patrol car had found an abandoned green canvas briefcase on the highway shoulder. He told me it had a wallet inside that identified the owner as a General Kenneth R. Kramer, U.S. Army. He told me he was calling Fort Bird because he figured it was the closest military installation to where the briefcase had been found. And he was calling to tell me where the briefcase was currently being held, in case I was interested in having someone sent out to pick it up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-11.html","bookId":2346,"book":{"id":2346,"title":"The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8)","description":"Storyline: \n The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8) \n Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case. \n New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall. \n Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. \n But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:16 AM"}}
