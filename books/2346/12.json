{"id":66277,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Summer drove. We took the Humvee I had left at the curb. We didn\u0027t want to take time to sign out a sedan. It cramped her style a little. Humvees are big slow trucks that are good for a lot of things, but covering paved roads fast isn\u0027t one of them. She looked tiny behind the wheel. The vehicle was full of noise. The engine was thrashing and the tires were whining loud. It was four o\u0027clock on a dull day and it was starting to go dark. We drove north to Kramer\u0027s motel and turned east through the cloverleaf and then north on I-95 itself. We covered fifteen miles and passed a rest area and started looking for the right State Police building. We found it twelve miles farther on. It was a long low one-story brick structure with a forest of tall radio masts bolted to its roof. It was maybe forty years old. The brick was dull tan. It was impossible to say whether it had started out yellow and then faded in the sun or whether it had started out white and gotten dirty from the traffic fumes. There were stainless-steel letters in an art deco style spelling out North Carolina State Police all along its length. We pulled in and parked in front of a pair of glass doors. Summer shut the Humvee down and we sat for a second and then slid out. Crossed a narrow sidewalk and pulled the doors and stepped inside the facility. It was a typical police place, built for function and floored with linoleum, which was shined every night whether it needed it or not. The walls had many layers of slick paint directly over concrete blocks. The air was hot and smelled faintly of sweat and stewed coffee. There was a desk guy behind a reception counter. We were in battledress uniform and our Humvee was visible behind us through the doors, so he made the connection fast enough. He didn\u0027t ask for ID or inquire why we were there. He didn\u0027t speculate as to why General Kramer hadn\u0027t shown up himself. He just glanced at me and spent a little longer looking at Summer and then leaned down under his counter and came back up with the briefcase. It was in a clear plastic bag. Not an evidence bag. Just some kind of a shopping bag. It had a store\u0027s name printed across it in red. The briefcase itself matched Kramer\u0027s suit carrier in every way. Same color, same design, same age, same level of wear and tear, no monogram. I opened it and looked inside. There was a wallet. There were plane tickets. There was a passport. There was a paper-clipped itinerary three sheets thick. There was a hardcover book. There was no conference agenda. I closed the case up again and laid it down on the counter. Butted it square with the edge. I was disappointed, but not surprised. \"Was it in the plastic bag when the trooper found it?\" I asked. The desk guy shook his head. He was looking at Summer, not me. \"I put it in the bag myself,\" he said. \"I wanted to keep it clean. I wasn\u0027t sure how soon someone would get here.\" \"Where exactly was it found?\" I asked him. He paused a beat and looked away from Summer and ran a thick fingertip down a desk ledger and across a line to a mile marker code. Then he turned around and used the same fingertip on a map. The map was a large-scale plan of North Carolina\u0027s portion of I-95 and was long and narrow, like a ribbon five inches wide. It showed every mile of the highway from where it entered from South Carolina and exited again into Virginia. The guy\u0027s finger hovered for a second and then came down, decisively. \"Here,\" he said. \"Northbound shoulder, a mile past the rest area, about eleven miles south of where we are right now.\" \"Any way of knowing how long it had been there?\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"We\u0027re not out there specifically looking for trash on the shoulders. Stuff can be there a month.\" \"So how was it found?\" \"Routine traffic stop. The trooper just saw it there, walking from his car to the car he had stopped.\" \"When was this exactly?\" \"Today,\" the guy said. \"Start of the second watch. Not long after noon.\" \"It wasn\u0027t there a month,\" I said. \"When did he lose it?\" \"New Year\u0027s Eve,\" I said. \"Where?\" \"It was stolen from where he was staying.\" \"Where was he staying?\" \"A motel about thirty miles south of here.\" \"So the bad guys were coming back north.\" \"I guess,\" I said. The guy looked at me like he was asking permission and then picked the case up with both hands and looked at it like he was a connoisseur and it was a rare piece. He turned it in the light and stared at it from every angle. \"January,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got a little night dew right now. And it\u0027s cold enough that we\u0027re worried about ice. So we\u0027ve got salt down. Things age fast, this time of year on the highway shoulder. And this looks old and worn, but not very deteriorated. It\u0027s got some grit on it, in the weave of the canvas. But not very much. It hasn\u0027t been out there since New Year\u0027s Eve, that much is for damn sure. Less than twenty-four hours, I\u0027d say. One night, not more.\" \"Can you be certain?\" Summer asked. He shook his head. Put the case back on the counter. \"Just a guess,\" he said. \"OK,\" I said. \"Thanks.\" \"You\u0027ll have to sign for it.\" I nodded. He reversed the desk ledger and pushed it toward me. I had Reacher in a subdued-pattern stencil above my right breast pocket, but I figured he hadn\u0027t paid much attention to it. He had spent most of his time looking at Summer\u0027s pockets. So I scrawled K. Kramer on the appropriate line in the book and picked up the briefcase and turned away. \"Funny sort of burglary,\" the desk guy said. \"There\u0027s an Amex card and money still in the wallet. We inventoried the contents.\" I didn\u0027t reply. Just went out through the doors, back to the Humvee. Summer waited for a gap in the traffic and then drove across all three lanes and bounced straight onto the soft grass median. She went down a slope and through a drainage ditch and straight up the other side. Paused and waited and turned left back onto the blacktop and headed south. That was the kind of thing a Humvee was good for. \"Try this,\" she said. \"Last night Vassell and Coomer leave Bird at ten o\u0027clock with the briefcase. They head north for Dulles or D.C. They extract the agenda and throw the case out the car window.\" \"They were in the bar and the dining room their whole time at Bird.\" \"So one of their dinner companions passed it on. We should check who they ate with. Maybe one of the women on the Humvee list was there.\" \"They were all alibied.\" \"Only superficially. New Year\u0027s Eve parties are pretty chaotic.\" I looked out the window. Afternoon was fading fast. Evening was coming on. The world looked dark and cold. \"Sixty miles,\" I said. \"The case was found sixty miles north of Bird. That\u0027s an hour. They would have grabbed the agenda and ditched the case faster than that.\" Summer said nothing. \"And they would have stopped at the rest area to do it. They would have put the case in a garbage can. That would have been safer. Throwing a briefcase out of a car window is pretty conspicuous.\" \"Maybe there really wasn\u0027t an agenda.\" \"It would be the first time in military history.\" \"Then maybe it really wasn\u0027t important.\" \"They ordered bag lunches at Irwin. Two-stars, one-stars, and colonels were planning to work through their lunch hour. That might be the first time in military history too. That was an important conference, Summer, believe me.\" She said nothing. \"Do that U-turn thing again,\" I said. \"Across the median. Then go back north a little. I want to look at the rest area.\" The rest area was the same as on most American interstates I had seen. The northbound highway and the southbound highway eased apart to put a long fat bulge into the median. The buildings were shared by both sets of travelers. Therefore they had two fronts and no backs. They were built of brick and had dormant flower beds and leafless trees all around them. There were gas pumps. There were angled parking slots. Right then the place seemed to be halfway between quiet and busy. It was the end of the holidays. Families were struggling home, ready for school, ready for work. The parking slots were maybe one-third filled with cars. Their distribution was interesting. People had grabbed the first parking spot they saw rather than chancing something farther on, even though that might have put them ultimately a little closer to the food and the bathrooms. Maybe it was human nature. Some kind of insecurity. There was a small semicircular plaza at the facility\u0027s main entrance. I could see bright neon signs inside at the food stations. Outside, there were six trash cans all fairly close to the doors. There were plenty of people around, looking in, looking out. \"Too public,\" Summer said. \"This is going nowhere.\" I nodded again. \"I\u0027d forget it in a heartbeat if it wasn\u0027t for Mrs. Kramer.\" \"Carbone is more important. We should prioritize.\" \"That feels like we\u0027re giving up.\" We went north out of the rest area and Summer did her off-roading thing across the median again and turned south. I got as comfortable as it was possible to get in a military vehicle and settled in for the ride back. Darkness unspooled on my left. There was a vague sunset in the West, to my right. The road looked damp. Summer didn\u0027t seem very worried about the possibility of ice. I did nothing for the first twenty minutes. Then I switched the dome light on and searched Kramer\u0027s briefcase, thoroughly. I didn\u0027t expect to find anything, and I wasn\u0027t proved wrong. His passport was a standard item, seven years old. He looked a little better in the picture than he had dead in the motel, but not much. He had plenty of stamps in and out of Germany and Belgium. The future battlefield and NATO HQ, respectively. He hadn\u0027t been anywhere else. He was a true specialist. For at least seven years he had concentrated exclusively on the world\u0027s last great tank arena and its command structure. The plane tickets were exactly what Garber had said they should be. Frankfurt to Dulles, and Washington National to Los Angeles, both round-trip. They were all coach class and government rate, booked three days before the first departure date. The itinerary matched the details on the plane tickets exactly. There were seat assignments. It seemed like Kramer preferred the aisle. Maybe his age was affecting his bladder. There was a reservation for a single room in Fort Irwin\u0027s Visiting Officers\u0027 Quarters, which he had never reached. His wallet contained thirty-seven American dollars and sixty-seven German marks, all in mixed small bills. The Amex card was the basic green item, due to expire in a year and a half. He had carried one since 1964, according to the Member Since rubric. I figured that was pretty early for an army officer. Back then most got by with cash and military scrip. Kramer must have been a sophisticated guy, financially. There was a Virginia driver\u0027s license. He had been using Green Valley as his permanent address, even though he avoided spending time there. There was a standard military ID card. There was a photograph of Mrs. Kramer, behind a plastic window. It showed a much younger version of the woman I had seen dead on her hallway floor. It was at least twenty years old. She had been pretty back then. She had long auburn hair that showed up a little orange from the way the photograph had faded with age. There was nothing else in the wallet. No receipts, no restaurant checks, no Amex carbons, no phone numbers, no scraps of paper. I wasn\u0027t surprised. Generals are often neat, organized people. They need fighting talent, but they need bureaucratic talent too. I guessed Kramer\u0027s office and desk and quarters would be the same as his wallet. They would contain everything he needed and nothing he didn\u0027t. The hardcover book was an academic monograph from a Midwestern university about the Battle of Kursk. Kursk happened in July of 1943. It was Nazi Germany\u0027s last grand offensive of World War Two and its first major defeat on an open battlefield. It turned into the greatest tank battle the world has ever seen, and ever will see, unless people like Kramer himself are eventually turned loose. I wasn\u0027t surprised by his choice of reading material. Some small part of him must have feared the closest he would ever get to truly cataclysmic action was reading about the hundreds of Tigers and Panthers and T-34s whirling and roaring through the choking summer dust all those years ago. There was nothing else in the briefcase. Just a few furred paper shreds trapped in the seams. It looked like Kramer was the sort of guy who emptied his case and turned it upside down and shook it every time he packed for a trip. I put everything back inside and buckled the little straps and laid the case on the floor by my feet. \"Speak to the dining room guy,\" I said. \"When we get back. Find out who was at the table with Vassell and Coomer.\" \"OK,\" Summer said. She drove on. We got back to Bird in time for dinner. We ate in the O Club bar with a bunch of fellow MPs. If Willard had spies among them, they would have seen nothing except a couple of tired people doing not very much of anything. But Summer slipped away between courses and came back with news in her eyes. I ate my dessert and drank my coffee slowly enough that nobody could think I had urgent business anywhere. Then I stood up and wandered out. Waited in the cold on the sidewalk. Summer came out five minutes later. I smiled. It felt like we were conducting a clandestine affair. \"Only one woman ate with Vassell and Coomer,\" she said. \"Who?\" I asked. \"Lieutenant Colonel Andrea Norton.\" \"The Psy-Ops person?\" \"The very same.\" \"She was at a party on New Year\u0027s Eve?\" Summer made a face. \"You know what those parties are like. A bar in town, hundreds of people, in and out all the time, noise, confusion, drinks, people disappearing two by two. She could have slipped away.\" \"Where was the bar?\" \"Thirty minutes from the motel.\" \"Then she would have been gone an hour, absolute minimum.\" \"That\u0027s possible.\" \"Was she in the bar at midnight? Holding hands and singing \u0027Auld Lang Syne\u0027? Whoever was standing next to her should be able to say for sure.\" \"People say she was there. But she could have made it back by then anyway. The kid said the Humvee left at eleven twenty-five. She\u0027d have been back with five minutes to spare. It could have looked natural. You know, everybody comes out of the woodwork, ready for the ball to drop. The party kind of starts over.\" I said nothing. \"She would have taken the case to sanitize it. Maybe her phone number was in there, or her name or her picture. Or a diary. She didn\u0027t want the scandal. But once she was through with it, she didn\u0027t need the rest of the stuff anymore. She\u0027d have been happy to hand it back when asked.\" \"How would Vassell and Coomer know who to ask?\" \"Hard to hide a long-standing affair in this fishbowl.\" \"Not logical,\" I said. \"If people knew about Kramer and Norton, why would someone go to the house in Virginia?\" \"OK, maybe they didn\u0027t know. Maybe it was just there on the list of possibilities. Maybe way down the list. Maybe it was something that people thought was over.\" I nodded. \"What can we get from her?\" \"We can get confirmation that Vassell and Coomer arranged to take possession of the briefcase last night. That would prove they were looking for it, which puts them in the frame for Mrs. Kramer.\" \"They made no calls from the hotel, and they didn\u0027t have time to get down there themselves. So I don\u0027t see how we can put them in the frame. What else can we get?\" \"We can be certain about what happened to the agenda. We can know that Vassell and Coomer got it back. Then at least the army can relax because we\u0027ll know for sure it isn\u0027t going to wind up on some public trash pile for a journalist to find.\" I nodded. Said nothing. \"And maybe Norton saw it,\" Summer said. \"Maybe she read it. Maybe she could tell us what all this fuss is about.\" \"That\u0027s tempting.\" \"It sure is.\" \"Can we just walk in and ask her?\" \"You\u0027re from the 110th. You can ask anyone anything.\" \"I have to stay under Willard\u0027s radar.\" \"She doesn\u0027t know he warned you off.\" \"She does. He spoke to her after the Carbone thing.\" \"I think we have to talk to her.\" \"Difficult kind of a talk to have,\" I said. \"She\u0027s likely to get offended.\" \"Only if we do it wrong.\" \"What are the chances of doing it right?\" \"We might be able to manipulate the situation. There\u0027ll be an embarrassment factor. She won\u0027t want it broadcast.\" \"We can\u0027t push her to the point where she calls Willard.\" \"You scared of him?\" \"I\u0027m scared of what he can do to us bureaucratically. Doesn\u0027t help anyone if we both get transferred to Alaska.\" \"Your call.\" I was quiet for a long moment. Thought back to Kramer\u0027s hardcover book. This was like July thirteenth, 1943, the pivotal day of the Battle of Kursk. We were like Alexander Vasilevsky, the Soviet general. If we attacked now, this minute, we had to keep on and on attacking until the enemy was run off his feet and the war was won. If we bogged down or paused for breath even for a second, we would be overrun again. \"OK,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s do it.\" We found Andrea Norton in the O Club lounge and I asked her if she would spare us a minute in her office. I could see she was puzzled as to why. I told her it was a confidential matter. She stayed puzzled. Willard had told her that Carbone was a closed case, and she couldn\u0027t see what else we would have to talk to her about. But she agreed. She told us she would meet us there in thirty minutes. Summer and I spent the thirty minutes in my office with her list of who was on-post and who wasn\u0027t at Carbone\u0027s time of death. She had yards of computer paper neatly folded into a large concertina about an inch thick. There was a name, rank, and number printed on each line with pale dot-matrix ink. Almost every name had a check mark next to it. \"What are the marks?\" I asked her. \"Here or not here?\" \"Here,\" she said. I nodded. I was afraid of that. I riffed through the concertina with my thumb. \"How many?\" I asked. \"Nearly twelve hundred.\" I nodded again. There was nothing intrinsically difficult about boiling down twelve hundred names and finding one sole perpetrator. Police files everywhere are full of larger suspect pools. There had been cases in Korea where the entire U.S. military strength had been the suspect pool. But cases like that require unlimited manpower, big staffs, and endless resources. And they require everybody\u0027s total cooperation. They can\u0027t be handled behind a CO\u0027s back, in secret, by two people acting alone. \"Impossible,\" I said. \"Nothing\u0027s impossible,\" Summer said. \"We have to go at it a different way.\" \"How?\" \"What did he take to the scene?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Wrong,\" I said. \"He took himself.\" Summer shrugged. Dragged her fingers up the folded edges of her paper. The stack thickened and then thinned back down as the air sighed out from between the pages. \"Pick a name,\" she said. \"He took a K-bar,\" I said. \"Twelve hundred names, twelve hundred K-bars.\" \"He took a tire iron or a crowbar.\" She nodded. \"And he took yogurt,\" I said. She said nothing. \"Four things,\" I said. \"Himself, a K-bar, a blunt instrument, and yogurt. Where did the yogurt come from?\" \"His refrigerator in his quarters,\" Summer said. \"Or one of the mess kitchens, or one of the mess buffets, or the commissary, or a supermarket or a deli or a grocery store somewhere off-post.\" I pictured a man breathing hard, walking fast, maybe sweating, a bloodstained knife and a crowbar clutched together in his right hand, an empty yogurt pot in his left, stumbling in the dark, nearing a destination, looking down, seeing the pot, hurling it into the undergrowth, putting the knife in his pocket, slipping the crowbar under his coat. \"We should look for the container,\" I said. Summer said nothing. \"He\u0027ll have ditched it,\" I said. \"Not close to the scene, but not far from it either.\" \"Will it help us?\" \"It\u0027ll have some kind of a product code on it. Maybe a best before date. Stuff like that. It might lead us to where it was bought.\" Then I paused. \"And it might have prints on it,\" I said. \"He\u0027ll have worn gloves.\" I shook my head. \"I\u0027ve seen people opening yogurt containers. But I\u0027ve never seen anyone do it with gloves on. There\u0027s a foil closure. With a tiny little tab to pull.\" \"We\u0027re on a hundred thousand acres here.\" I nodded. Square one. Normally a couple of phone calls would get me all the grunts on the post lined up a yard apart on their knees, crawling slowly across the terrain like a giant human comb, staring down at the ground and parting every blade of grass by hand. And then doing it again the next day, and the next, until one of them found what we were looking for. With manpower like the army has, you can find a needle in a haystack. You can find both halves of a broken needle. You can find the tiny chip of chrome that flaked off the break. Summer looked at the clock on the wall. \"Our thirty minutes are up,\" she said. We used the Humvee to get over to Psy-Ops and parked in a slot that was probably reserved for someone else. It was nine o\u0027clock. Summer killed the motor and we opened the doors and slipped out into the cold. I took Kramer\u0027s briefcase with me. We walked through the old tiled corridors and came to Norton\u0027s door. Her light was on. I knocked and we went in. Norton was behind her desk. All her textbooks were back on her shelves. There were no legal pads on view. No pens or pencils. Her desktop was clear. The pool of light from her lamp was a perfect circle on the empty wood. She had three visitor\u0027s chairs. She waved us toward them. Summer sat on the right. I sat on the left. I propped Kramer\u0027s briefcase on the center chair, facing Norton, like a ghost at the feast. She didn\u0027t look at it. \"How can I help you?\" she said. I made a point of adjusting the briefcase\u0027s position so that it was completely upright on the chair. \"Tell us about the dinner party last night,\" I said. \"What dinner party?\" \"You ate with some Armored staffers who were visiting.\" She nodded. \"Vassell and Coomer,\" she said. \"So?\" \"They worked for General Kramer.\" She nodded again. \"So I believe.\" \"Tell us about the meal.\" \"The food?\" \"The atmosphere,\" I said. \"The conversation. The mood.\" \"It was just dinner in the O Club,\" she said. \"Someone gave Vassell and Coomer a briefcase.\" \"Did they? What, like a present?\" I said nothing. \"I don\u0027t remember that,\" Norton said. \"When?\" \"During dinner,\" I said. \"Or as they were leaving.\" Nobody spoke. \"A briefcase?\" Norton said. \"Was it you?\" Summer asked. Norton looked at her, blankly. She was either genuinely puzzled, or she was a superb actress. \"Was it me what?\" \"Who gave them the briefcase.\" \"Why would I give them a briefcase? I hardly knew them.\" \"How well did you know them?\" \"I met them once or twice, years ago.\" \"At Irwin?\" \"I believe so.\" \"Why did you eat with them?\" \"I was in the bar. They asked me. It would have been rude to decline.\" \"Did you know they were coming?\" I asked. \"No,\" she said. \"I had no idea. I was surprised they weren\u0027t in Germany.\" \"So you knew them well enough to know where they\u0027re based.\" \"Kramer was an Armored Branch commander in Europe. They were his staffers. I wouldn\u0027t expect to find them based in Hawaii.\" Nobody spoke. I watched Norton\u0027s eyes. She hadn\u0027t looked at Kramer\u0027s briefcase longer than about half a second. Just long enough to figure I was some guy who carried a briefcase, and then to forget all about it. \"What\u0027s going on here?\" she said. I didn\u0027t answer. \"Tell me.\" I pointed to the briefcase. \"This is General Kramer\u0027s. He lost it on New Year\u0027s Eve and it showed up again today. We\u0027re trying to figure out where it\u0027s been.\" \"Where did he lose it?\" Summer moved in her chair. \"In a motel,\" she said. \"During a sexual assignation with a woman from this post. The woman was driving a Humvee. Therefore we\u0027re looking for women who knew Kramer, and who have permanent access to Humvees, and who were off-post on New Year\u0027s Eve, and who were at dinner last night.\" \"I was the only woman at dinner last night.\" Silence. Summer nodded. \"We know that. And we promise we can keep the whole thing quiet, but first we need you to confirm who you gave the briefcase to.\" The room stayed quiet. Norton looked at Summer like she had told a joke with a punch line she didn\u0027t quite understand. \"You think I was sleeping with General Kramer?\" she said. Summer said nothing. \"Well, I wasn\u0027t,\" Norton said. \"God forbid.\" Nobody spoke. \"I don\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m seriously conflicted. That\u0027s a completely absurd accusation. I\u0027m astonished you made it.\" Nobody spoke for a long time. Norton smiled, like the main component of her reaction was amusement. Not anger. She closed her eyes and opened them a moment later, like she was erasing the conversation from her memory. \"Is there something missing from the briefcase?\" she asked me. I didn\u0027t answer. \"Help me out here,\" she said. \"Please. I\u0027m trying to see the point of this extraordinary visit. Is there something missing from Kramer\u0027s briefcase?\" \"Vassell and Coomer say not.\" \"But?\" \"I don\u0027t believe them.\" \"You probably should. They\u0027re senior officers.\" I said nothing. \"What does your new CO say?\" \"He doesn\u0027t want it pursued. He\u0027s worried about embarrassment.\" \"You should be guided by him.\" \"I\u0027m an investigator. I have to ask questions.\" \"The army is a family,\" she said. \"We\u0027re all on the same side.\" \"Did Vassell or Coomer leave with this briefcase last night?\" I said. Norton closed her eyes again. At first I thought she was just exasperated, but then I realized she was picturing last night\u0027s scene, at the O Club coat check. \"No,\" she said. \"Neither one of them left with that briefcase.\" \"Are you absolutely sure?\" \"I\u0027m totally certain.\" \"What was their mood during dinner?\" She opened her eyes. \"They were relaxed,\" she said. \"Like they were passing an empty evening.\" \"Did they say why they were at Bird again?\" \"General Kramer\u0027s funeral was yesterday, at noon.\" \"I didn\u0027t know that.\" \"I believe Walter Reed released the body and the Pentagon handled the details.\" \"Where was the funeral?\" \"Arlington Cemetery,\" she said. \"Where else?\" \"That\u0027s three hundred miles away.\" \"Approximately. As the crow flies.\" \"So why did they come down here for dinner?\" \"They didn\u0027t tell me,\" she said. I said nothing. \"Anything else?\" she asked. I shook my head. \"A motel?\" she said. \"Do I look like the kind of woman who would agree to meet a man in a motel?\" I didn\u0027t answer. \"Dismissed,\" she said. I stood up. Summer did the same. I took Kramer\u0027s briefcase from the center chair and walked out of the room. Summer followed behind me. \"Did you believe her?\" Summer asked me. We were sitting in the Humvee outside the Psy-Ops building. The engine was idling and the heater was blowing hot stale air that smelled of diesel. \"Totally,\" I said. \"As soon as she didn\u0027t look at the briefcase. She\u0027d have gotten very flustered if she\u0027d ever seen it before. And I certainly believed her about the motel. It would cost you a suite at the Ritz to get in her pants.\" \"So what did we learn?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Nothing at all.\" \"No, we learned that Bird is a very attractive place, apparently. Vassell and Coomer keep coming all the way down here, for no very obvious reason.\" \"Tell me about it,\" I said. \"And that Norton thinks we\u0027re a family.\" \"Officers,\" I said. \"What do you expect?\" \"You\u0027re an officer. I\u0027m an officer.\" I nodded. \"I was at West Point for four years,\" I said. \"I should know better. I should have changed my name and come back in as a private. Three promotions, I\u0027d be an E-4 specialist by now. Maybe even an E-5 sergeant. I wish I was.\" \"What now?\" I checked my watch. It was close to ten o\u0027clock. \"Sleep,\" I said. \"First light, we go out looking for a yogurt container.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-12.html","bookId":2346,"book":{"id":2346,"title":"The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8)","description":"Storyline: The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8) Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case. New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall. Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:16 AM"}}
