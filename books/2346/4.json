{"id":66269,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"We went back across the road to the motel and made the kid tell the story all over again. He was surly and he wasn\u0027t talkative, but he made a good witness. Unhelpful people often do. They\u0027re not trying to please you. They\u0027re not trying to impress you. They\u0027re not making all kinds of stuff up, trying to tell you what you want to hear. He said he was sitting in the office, alone, doing nothing, and at about eleven twenty-five in the evening he heard a vehicle door slam and then a big turbodiesel start up. He described sounds that must have been a gearbox slamming into reverse and a four-wheel-drive transfer case locking up. Then there was tire noise and engine noise and gravel noise and something very large and heavy sped away in a big hurry. He said he got off his stool and went outside to look. Didn\u0027t see the vehicle. \"Why did you check the room?\" I asked him. He shrugged. \"I thought maybe it was on fire.\" \"On fire?\" \"People do stuff like that, in a place like this. They set the room on fire. And then hightail out. For kicks. Or something. I don\u0027t know. It was unusual.\" \"How did you know which room to check?\" He went very quiet at that point. Summer pressed him for an answer. Then I did. We did the good cop, bad cop thing. Eventually he admitted it was the only room rented for the whole night. All the others were renting by the hour, and were being serviced by foot traffic from across the street, not by vehicles. He said that was how he had been so sure there was never a hooker in Kramer\u0027s room. It was his responsibility to check them in and out. He took the money and issued the keys. Kept track of the comings and the goings. So he always knew for sure who was where. It was a part of his function. A part he was supposed to keep very quiet about. \"I\u0027ll lose my job now,\" he said. He got worried to the point of tears and Summer had to calm him down. Then he told us he had found Kramer\u0027s body and called the cops and cleared all the hourly renters out for safety\u0027s sake. Then Deputy Chief Stockton had shown up within about fifteen minutes. Then I had shown up, and when I left sometime later the kid recognized the same vehicle sounds he had heard before. Same engine noise, same drivetrain noises, same tire whine. He was convincing. He had already admitted that hookers used the place all the time, so he had no more reason to lie. And Humvees were still relatively new. Still relatively rare. And they made a distinctive noise. So I believed him. We left him there on his stool and stepped outside into the cold red glow of the Coke machine. \"No hooker,\" Summer said. \"A woman from the base instead.\" \"A woman officer,\" I said. \"Maybe fairly senior. Someone with permanent access to her own Humvee. Nobody signs out a pool vehicle for an assignation like that. And she\u0027s got his briefcase. She must have.\" \"She\u0027ll be easy to find. She\u0027ll be in the gate log, time out, time in.\" \"I might have even passed her on the road. If she left here at eleven twenty-five she wasn\u0027t back at Bird before twelve-fifteen. I was leaving around then.\" \"If she went straight back to the post.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"If.\" \"Did you see another Humvee?\" \"Don\u0027t think so,\" I said. \"Who do you think she is?\" I shrugged. \"Like we figured about the phantom hooker. Someone he met somewhere. Irwin, probably, but it could have been anywhere.\" I stared across at the gas station. Watched cars go by on the road. \"Vassell and Coomer might know her,\" Summer said. \"You know, if it was a long-term thing between her and Kramer.\" \"Yes, they might.\" \"Where do you think they are?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll find them if I need them.\" I didn\u0027t find them. They found me. They were waiting for me in my borrowed office when we got back. Summer dropped me at my door and went to park the car. I walked past the outer desk. The night-shift sergeant was back. The mountain woman, with the baby son and the paycheck worries. She gestured at the inner door in a way that told me someone was in there. Someone that ranked a lot higher than either of us. \"Got coffee?\" I said. \"The machine is on,\" she said. I took some with me. My coat was still unbuttoned. My hair was a mess. I looked exactly like a guy who had been brawling in a parking lot. I walked straight to the desk. Put my coffee down. There were two guys in upright visitor chairs against the wall, facing me. They were both in woodland BDUs. One had a Brigadier General\u0027s star on his collar and the other had a colonel\u0027s eagle. The general had Vassell on his nametape and the colonel had Coomer. Vassell was bald and Coomer wore eyeglasses and they were both pompous enough and old enough and short and soft and pink enough to look vaguely ridiculous in BDUs. They looked like Rotary Club members on their way to a fancy dress ball. First impression, I didn\u0027t like them very much. I sat down in my chair and saw two slips of paper stacked square in the center of the blotter. The first was a note that said: Your brother called again. Urgent. This time there was a phone number with it. It had a 202 area code. Washington D.C. \"Don\u0027t you salute senior officers?\" Vassell said, from his chair. The second note said: Col. Garber called. Green Valley PD calculates Mrs. K died approx. 0200. I folded both notes separately and tucked them side by side under the base of my telephone. Adjusted them so I could see exactly half of each one. Looked up in time to see Vassell glaring at me. His naked scalp was going red. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"What was the question?\" \"Don\u0027t you salute senior officers when you enter a room?\" \"If they\u0027re in my chain of command,\" I said. \"You\u0027re not.\" \"I don\u0027t consider that an answer,\" he said. \"Look it up,\" I said. \"I\u0027m with the 110th Special Unit. We\u0027re separate. Structurally we\u0027re parallel to the rest of the army. We have to be, if you think about it. We can\u0027t police you if we\u0027re in your chain of command ourselves.\" \"I\u0027m not here to be policed, son,\" Vassell said. \"So why are you here? It\u0027s kind of late for a social visit.\" \"I\u0027m here to ask some questions.\" \"Ask away,\" I said. \"Then I\u0027ll ask some of my own. And you know what the difference will be?\" He said nothing. \"I\u0027ll be answering out of courtesy,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll be answering because the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires you to.\" Vassell said nothing. Just glared at me. Then he glanced at Coomer. Coomer looked back at him, and then at me. \"We\u0027re here about General Kramer,\" he said. \"We\u0027re his senior staff.\" \"I know who you are,\" I said. \"Tell us about the general.\" \"He\u0027s dead,\" I said. \"We\u0027re aware of that. We\u0027d like to know the circumstances.\" \"He had a heart attack.\" \"Where?\" \"Inside his chest cavity.\" Vassell glowered. \"Where did he die?\" Coomer said. \"I can\u0027t tell you that,\" I said. \"It\u0027s germane to an ongoing inquiry.\" \"In what way?\" Vassell said. \"In a confidential way.\" \"It was around here somewhere,\" he said. \"That much is already common knowledge.\" \"Well, there you go,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the conference at Irwin about?\" \"What?\" \"The conference at Irwin,\" I said again. \"Where you were all headed.\" \"What about it?\" \"I need to know the agenda.\" Vassell looked at Coomer and Coomer opened his mouth to start telling me something when my phone rang. It was my desk sergeant. She had Summer out there with her. She was unsure whether to send her in. I told her to go right ahead. So there was a tap on the door and Summer came in. I introduced her all around and she pulled a spare chair over to my desk and sat down, alongside me, facing them. Two against two. I pulled the second note out from under the telephone and passed it to her: Col. Garber called. Green Valley PD calculates Mrs. K died approx. 0200. She unfolded it and read it and refolded it and passed it back to me. I put it back under the phone. Then I asked Vassell and Coomer about the Irwin agenda again, and watched their attitudes change. They didn\u0027t get any more helpful. It was more of a sideways move than an improvement. But because there was now a woman in the room they dialed down the overt hostility and replaced it with smug patronizing civility. They came from that kind of a background and that kind of a generation. They hated MPs and I was sure they hated women officers, but all of a sudden they felt they had to be polite. \"It was going to be purely routine,\" Coomer said. \"Just a regular powwow. Nothing of any great importance.\" \"Which explains why you didn\u0027t actually go,\" I said. \"Naturally. It seemed much more appropriate to remain here. You know, under the circumstances.\" \"How did you find out about Kramer?\" \"XII Corps called us.\" \"From Germany?\" \"That\u0027s where XII Corps is, son,\" Vassell said. \"Where did you stay last night?\" \"In a hotel,\" Coomer said. \"Which one?\" \"The Jefferson. In D.C.\" \"Private or on a DoD ticket?\" \"That hotel is authorized for senior officers.\" \"Why didn\u0027t General Kramer stay there?\" \"Because he made alternative arrangements.\" \"When?\" \"When what?\" Coomer said. \"When did he make these alternative arrangements?\" \"Some days ago.\" \"So it wasn\u0027t a spur of the moment thing?\" \"No, it wasn\u0027t.\" \"Do you know what those arrangements were?\" \"Obviously not,\" Vassell said. \"Or we wouldn\u0027t be asking you where he died.\" \"You didn\u0027t think he was maybe visiting with his wife?\" \"Was he?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Why do you need to know where he died?\" There was a long pause. Their attitudes changed again. The smugness fell away and they replaced it with a kind of winsome frankness. \"We don\u0027t really need to know,\" Vassell said. He leaned forward and glanced at Summer like he wished she weren\u0027t there. Like he wanted this new intimacy to be purely man-to-man with me. \"And we have no specific information or direct knowledge at all, but we\u0027re worried that General Kramer\u0027s private arrangements could lead to the potential for embarrassment, in light of the circumstances.\" \"How well did you know him?\" \"On a professional level, very well indeed. On a personal level, about as well as anyone knows his brother officer. Which is to say, perhaps not well enough.\" \"But you suspect in general terms what his arrangements might have been.\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"We have our suspicions.\" \"So it wasn\u0027t a surprise to you that he didn\u0027t bunk at the hotel.\" \"No,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t.\" \"And it wasn\u0027t a surprise when I told you he wasn\u0027t visiting with his wife.\" \"Not entirely, no.\" \"So you suspected roughly what he might be doing, but you didn\u0027t know where.\" Vassell nodded his head. \"Roughly.\" \"Did you know with whom he might have been doing it?\" Vassell shook his head. \"We have no specific information,\" he said. \"OK,\" I said. \"Doesn\u0027t really matter. I\u0027m sure you know the army well enough to realize that if we discover a potential for embarrassment, we\u0027ll cover it up.\" There was a long pause. \"Have all traces been removed?\" Coomer asked. \"From wherever it was?\" I nodded. \"We took his stuff.\" \"Good.\" \"I need the Irwin conference agenda,\" I said. There was another pause. \"There wasn\u0027t one,\" Vassell said. \"I\u0027m sure there was,\" I said. \"This is the army. It\u0027s not the Actors Studio. We don\u0027t do free improvisation sessions.\" There was a pause. \"There was nothing on paper,\" Coomer said. \"I told you, Major, it was no big deal.\" \"How did you spend your day today?\" \"Chasing rumors about the general.\" \"How did you get down here from D.C.?\" \"We have a car and a driver on loan from the Pentagon.\" \"You checked out of the Jefferson?\" \"Yes, we did.\" \"So your bags are in the Pentagon car?\" \"Yes, they are.\" \"Where is the car?\" \"Waiting outside your post headquarters.\" \"It\u0027s not my post headquarters,\" I said. \"I\u0027m here on temporary detachment.\" I turned to Summer and told her to go fetch their briefcases from the car. They got all outraged, but they knew they couldn\u0027t stop me doing it. Civilian notions about unreasonable search and seizure and warrants and probable cause stop at an army post main gate. I watched their eyes while Summer was gone. They were annoyed, but they weren\u0027t worried. So either they were telling the truth about the Irwin conference or they had already ditched the relevant paperwork. But I went through the motions anyway. Summer got back carrying two identical briefcases. They were exactly like the one Kramer had in his silver-framed photographs. Staffers kiss up in all kinds of ways. I searched through them on my desk. I found passports, plane tickets, travel vouchers, and itineraries in both of them. But no agendas for Fort Irwin. \"Sorry for the inconvenience,\" I said. \"Happy now, son?\" Vassell said. \"Kramer\u0027s wife is dead too,\" I said. \"Did you know that?\" I watched them carefully, and I saw that they didn\u0027t know. They stared at me and stared at each other and started to get pale and upset. \"How?\" Vassell said. \"When?\" Coomer said. \"Last night,\" I said. \"She was a homicide victim.\" \"Where?\" \"In her house. There was an intruder.\" \"Do we know who it was?\" \"No, we don\u0027t. It\u0027s not our case. It\u0027s a civilian jurisdiction.\" \"What was it? A burglary?\" \"It maybe started out that way.\" They said nothing more. Summer and I walked them out to the sidewalk in front of post headquarters and watched them climb into their Pentagon car. It was a Mercury Grand Marquis, a couple of model years newer than Mrs. Kramer\u0027s big old boat, and black rather than green. Their driver was a tall guy in BDUs. He had subdued-order badges on and I couldn\u0027t make out his name or his rank in the dark. But he didn\u0027t look like an enlisted man. He U-turned smoothly across the empty road and drove Vassell and Coomer away. We watched his taillights disappear north, through the main gate, and away into the darkness beyond. \"What do you think?\" Summer said. \"I think they\u0027re full of shit,\" I said. \"Important shit or regular flag-rank shit?\" \"They\u0027re lying,\" I said. \"They\u0027re uptight, they\u0027re lying, and they\u0027re stupid. Why am I worried about Kramer\u0027s briefcase?\" \"Sensitive paperwork,\" she said. \"Whatever he was carrying to California.\" I nodded. \"They just defined it for me. It\u0027s the conference agenda itself.\" \"You\u0027re sure there was one?\" \"There\u0027s always an agenda. And it\u0027s always on paper. There\u0027s a paper agenda for everything. You want to change the dog food in the K-9 kennels, you need forty-seven separate meetings with forty-seven separate paper agendas. So there was one for Irwin, that\u0027s for damn sure. It was completely stupid to say there wasn\u0027t. If they\u0027ve got something to hide, they should have just said it\u0027s too secret for me to see.\" \"Maybe the conference really wasn\u0027t important.\" \"That\u0027s bullshit too. It was very important.\" \"Why?\" \"Because a two-star general was going. And a one-star. And because it was New Year\u0027s Eve, Summer. Who flies on New Year\u0027s Eve and spends the night in a lousy stopover hotel? And this year in Germany was a big deal. The Wall is coming down. We won, after forty-five years. The parties must have been incredible. Who would miss them for something unimportant? To have gotten those three guys on a plane on New Year\u0027s Eve, this Irwin thing had to be some kind of a very big deal.\" \"They were upset about Mrs. Kramer. More than about Kramer himself.\" I nodded. \"Maybe they liked her.\" \"They must have liked Kramer too.\" \"No, he\u0027s just a tactical problem for them. It\u0027s an unsentimental business, up there at their level. They hitched themselves to him, and now he\u0027s dead, and they\u0027re worrying about where that leaves them.\" \"Ready for promotion, maybe.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But if Kramer turns out to be an embarrassment, they could go down with him.\" \"Then they should be reassured. You promised them a cover-up.\" There was something prim in her voice. Like she was suggesting I shouldn\u0027t have promised them any such thing. \"We protect the army, Summer,\" I said. \"Like family. That\u0027s what we\u0027re for.\" Then I paused. \"But did you notice they didn\u0027t shut up after that? They should have taken the hint. Cover-up requested, cover-up promised. Asked and answered, mission accomplished.\" \"They wanted to know where his stuff was.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"They did. And you know what that means? It means they\u0027re looking for Kramer\u0027s briefcase too. Because of the agenda. Kramer\u0027s copy is the only one still outside of their direct control. They came down here to check if I had it.\" Summer looked in the direction their car had gone. I could still smell its exhaust in the air. An acid tang from the catalyst. \"How do civilian medics work?\" I asked her. \"Suppose you\u0027re my wife, and I go down with a heart attack? What do you do?\" \"I call 911.\" \"And then what happens?\" \"The ambulance shows up. Takes you to the emergency room.\" \"And let\u0027s say I\u0027m DOA when I get there. Where would you be?\" \"I would have ridden to the hospital with you.\" \"And where would my briefcase be?\" \"At home,\" she said. \"Wherever you left it.\" Then she paused. \"What? You think someone went to Mrs. Kramer\u0027s house last night looking for the briefcase?\" \"It\u0027s a plausible sequence,\" I said. \"Someone hears that he\u0027s dead from a heart attack, assumes he was pronounced in the ambulance or the emergency room, assumes whoever he was with would have accompanied him, goes down there expecting to find an empty house with a briefcase in it.\" \"But Kramer was never there.\" \"It was a reasonable first try.\" \"You think it was Vassell and Coomer?\" I said nothing. \"That\u0027s crazy,\" Summer said. \"They don\u0027t look the type.\" \"Don\u0027t let looks fool you. They\u0027re Armored Branch. They\u0027ve trained all their lives to roll right over anything that gets in their way. But I don\u0027t think the timing works for them. Let\u0027s say Garber called XII Corps in Germany at twelve-fifteen, earliest. Then let\u0027s say XII Corps called the hotel back here in the States at twelve-thirty, earliest. Green Valley is seventy minutes from D.C. and Mrs. Kramer died at two o\u0027clock. That would have given them a twenty-minute margin to react, maximum. They were just in from the airport, so they didn\u0027t have a car with them, and it would have taken time to get hold of one. And they certainly didn\u0027t have a crowbar with them. Nobody travels with a crowbar in their luggage, just in case. And I doubt if the Home Depot was open, after midnight on New Year\u0027s Eve.\" \"So someone else is out there looking?\" \"We need to find that agenda,\" I said. \"We need to nail this thing down.\" I sent Summer away to do three things: first, list all female personnel at Fort Bird with access to their own Humvees, and second, list any of them who might have met Kramer at Fort Irwin in California, and third, contact the Jefferson Hotel in D.C. and get Vassell and Coomer\u0027s exact check-in and checkout times, plus details on all their incoming and outgoing phone calls. I went back to my office and filed the note from Garber and spread the note from my brother on the blotter and dialed the number. He picked up on the first ring. \"Hey, Joe,\" I said. \"Jack?\" \"What?\" \"I got a call.\" \"Who from?\" \"Mom\u0027s doctor,\" he said. \"About what?\" \"She\u0027s dying.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-4.html","bookId":2346,"book":{"id":2346,"title":"The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8)","description":"Storyline: The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8) Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case. New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall. Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:16 AM"}}
