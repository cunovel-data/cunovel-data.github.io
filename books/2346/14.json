{"id":66279,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"My oppo at Jackson was a guy called Sanchez. I knew him fairly well, and I liked him better. He was smart, and he was good. I put the call on the speaker to include Summer and we talked briefly about jurisdiction, but without much enthusiasm. Jurisdiction was always a gray area, and we all knew we were beaten from the get-go. Brubaker had been on vacation, he had been in civilian clothes, he had been in a city alley, and therefore the Columbia PD was claiming him. There was nothing we could do about it. And the Columbia PD had notified the FBI, because Brubaker\u0027s last known whereabouts were the North Carolina golf hotel, which added a possible interstate dimension to the situation, and interstate homicide was the Bureau\u0027s bag. And also because an army officer is technically a federal employee, and killing federal employees is a separate offense, which would give them another charge to throw at the perp if by any miracle they ever found him. Neither Sanchez nor I nor Summer cared a whole hell of a lot about the difference between state courts and federal courts, but we all knew if the FBI was involved the case was well beyond our grasp. We agreed the very best we could hope for was that we might eventually see some of the relevant documentation, strictly for informational purposes only, and strictly as a courtesy. Summer made a face and turned away. I took the phone off the speaker and picked it up and spoke to Sanchez one-on-one again. \"Got a feeling?\" I asked him. \"Someone he knew,\" Sanchez said. \"Not easy to surprise a Delta soldier as good as Brubaker was, in an alley.\" \"Weapon?\" \"Paramedics figured it for a nine-millimeter handgun. And they should know. They see plenty of GSWs. Apparently they do a lot of cleaning up every Friday and Saturday night, in that part of town.\" \"Why was he there?\" \"No idea. Rendezvous, presumably. With someone he knew.\" \"Got a feeling about when?\" \"The body\u0027s stone cold, the skin is a little green, and rigor is all gone. They\u0027re saying twenty-four or forty-eight hours. Safe bet would be to split the difference. Let\u0027s call it the middle of the night before last. Maybe three, four A.M. City garbage truck found him at ten this morning. Weekly trash collection.\" \"Where were you on December twenty-eighth?\" \"Korea. You?\" \"Panama.\" \"Why did they move us?\" \"I keep thinking we\u0027re about to find out,\" I said. \"Something weird is going on,\" Sanchez said. \"I checked, because I was curious, and there are more than twenty of us in the same boat, worldwide. And Garber\u0027s signature is on all the orders, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s legit.\" \"I\u0027m certain it isn\u0027t legit,\" I said. \"Anything happening down there before this Brubaker situation?\" \"Not a thing. Quietest week I ever spent.\" We hung up. I sat still for a long moment. Seemed to me that Columbia in South Carolina was about two hundred miles from Fort Bird. Drive southwest on the highway, cross the state line, find I-20 heading west, drive some more, and you were there. About two hundred miles. The night before last was the night we found Carbone\u0027s body. I had left Andrea Norton\u0027s office just before two o\u0027clock in the morning. She could alibi me up until that point. Then I had been in the mortuary at seven o\u0027clock, for the postmortem. The pathologist could confirm that. So I had two unconnected alibi bookends. But 0200 until 0700 still gave me a possible five-hour window, with Brubaker\u0027s likely time of death right there in the middle of it. Could I have driven two hundred miles there and two hundred miles back in five hours? \"What?\" Summer said. \"The Delta guys have already got me in the frame for Carbone. Now I\u0027m wondering whether they\u0027re going to be coming at me for Brubaker too. How does four hundred miles in five hours sound to you?\" \"I could probably do it,\" she said. \"Average of eighty miles an hour all the way. Depends on what car I was using, of course, and road construction, and traffic, and weather, and cops. It\u0027s definitely possible.\" \"Terrific.\" \"But it\u0027s marginal.\" \"It better be marginal. Killing Brubaker will be like killing God, to them.\" \"You going over there to break the news?\" I nodded. \"I think I have to. It\u0027s a question of respect. But you inform the post commander for me, OK?\" The Special Forces adjutant was an asshole, but he was human too. He went very pale when I told him about Brubaker, and there was clearly more to it than an anticipation of mere bureaucratic hassle. From what I had heard Brubaker was stern and distant and authoritarian, but he was a real father figure, to his men individually and to his unit as a whole. And to his unit as a concept. Special Forces generally and Delta in particular hadn\u0027t always been popular inside the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. The army hates change and it takes a long time to get used to things. The idea of a ragtag bunch of hunter-killers had been a hard sell at the outset, and Brubaker had been one of the guys doing the selling, and he had never let up since. His death was going to hit Special Forces the way the death of a president would hit the nation. \"Carbone was bad enough,\" the adjutant said. \"But this is unbelievable. Is there a connection?\" I looked at him. \"Why would there be a connection?\" I said. \"Carbone was a training accident.\" He said nothing. \"Why was Brubaker at a hotel?\" \"Because he likes to play golf. He\u0027s got a house near Bragg from way back, but he doesn\u0027t like the golf there.\" \"Where was the hotel?\" \"Outside of Raleigh.\" \"Did he go there a lot?\" \"Every chance he got.\" \"Does his wife play golf?\" The adjutant nodded. \"They play together.\" Then he paused. \"Played,\" he said, and then he went quiet and looked away from me. I pictured Brubaker in my mind. I had never met him, but I knew guys just like him. One day they\u0027re talking about how to angle a claymore mine so the little ball bearings explode outward at exactly the right angle to rip the enemy\u0027s spines out of their backs with maximum efficiency. Next day they\u0027re wearing pastel shirts with small crocodiles on the breast, playing golf with their wives, maybe holding hands and smiling as they ride together along the fairways in their little electric carts. I knew plenty of guys like that. My own father had been one. Not that he had ever played golf. He watched birds. He had been in most countries in the world, and he had seen a lot of birds. I stood up. \"Call me if you need me,\" I said. \"You know, if there\u0027s anything I can do.\" The adjutant nodded. \"Thanks for the visit,\" he said. \"Better than a phone call.\" I went back to my office. Summer wasn\u0027t there. I wasted more than an hour with her personnel lists. I made a shortcut decision and took the pathologist out of the mix. I took Summer out. I took Andrea Norton out. Then I took all the women out. The medical evidence was pretty clear about the attacker\u0027s height and strength. I took the O Club dining room staff out. Their NCO had said they were all hard at work, fussing over their guests. I took the cooks out, and the bar staff, and the MP gate guards. I took out anyone listed as hospitalized and nonambulatory. I took myself out. I took Carbone out, because it wasn\u0027t suicide. Then I counted the remaining check marks, and wrote the number 973 on a slip of paper. That was our suspect pool. I stared into space. My phone rang. I picked it up. It was Sanchez again, down at Fort Jackson. \"Columbia PD just called me,\" he said. \"They\u0027re sharing their initial findings.\" \"And?\" \"Their medical examiner doesn\u0027t entirely agree with me. Time of death wasn\u0027t three or four in the morning. It was one twenty-three A.M., the night before last.\" \"That\u0027s very precise.\" \"Bullet caught his wristwatch.\" \"A broken watch? Can\u0027t necessarily rely on that.\" \"No, it\u0027s firm enough. They did a lot of other tests. Wrong season for measurable insect activity, which would have helped, but the stomach contents were exactly right for five or six hours after he ate a heavy dinner.\" \"What does his wife say?\" \"He disappeared at eight that night, after a heavy dinner. Got up from the table and never came back.\" \"What did she do about it?\" \"Nothing,\" Sanchez said. \"He was Special Forces. Their whole marriage, he\u0027ll have been disappearing with no warning, the middle of dinner, the middle of the night, days or weeks at a time, never able to say where or why afterward. She was used to it.\" \"Did he get a phone call or something?\" \"She assumes he did, at some point. She\u0027s not really sure. She was in the spa before dinner. They\u0027d just played twenty-seven holes.\" \"Can you call her yourself? She\u0027ll talk to you faster than civilian cops.\" \"I could try, I suppose.\" \"Anything else?\" I said. \"The GSWs were nine-millimeter,\" he said. \"Two rounds fired, both of them through and through, neat entry wounds, bad exit wounds.\" \"Full metal jackets,\" I said. \"Contact shots. There were powder burns. And soot.\" I paused. I couldn\u0027t picture it. Two rounds fired? Contact shots? So one of the bullets goes in, comes out, loops all the way around, comes back, and drops down and smashes his wristwatch? \"Did he have his hands on his head?\" \"He was shot from behind, Reacher. A double tap, to the back of the skull. Bang bang, thank you and good night. The second round must have gone through his head and caught his watch. Downward trajectory. Tall shooter.\" I said nothing. \"Right,\" Sanchez said. \"How likely is all that? Did you know him?\" \"Never met him,\" I said. \"He was way above average. He was a real pro. And he was a thinker. Any angle, any advantage, any wrinkle, he knew it and he was ready to use it.\" \"But he got himself shot in the back of the head?\" \"He knew the shooter, definitely. Had to. Why else would he turn his back, in the middle of the night, in an alley?\" \"You looking at people from Jackson?\" \"That\u0027s a lot of people.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"Did he have enemies at Bird?\" \"Not that I\u0027ve heard,\" I said. \"He had enemies up the chain of command.\" \"Those pussies don\u0027t meet people in alleys in the middle of the night.\" \"Where was the alley?\" \"Not in a quiet part of town.\" \"So did anyone hear anything?\" \"Nobody,\" Sanchez said. \"Columbia PD ran a canvass and came up empty.\" \"That\u0027s weird.\" \"They\u0027re civilians. What else would they be?\" He went quiet. \"You met Willard yet?\" I asked him. \"He\u0027s on his way here right now. Seems to be a real hands-on type of asshole.\" \"What was the alley like?\" \"Whores and crack dealers. Nothing that the Columbia city fathers are likely to put in their tourism brochures.\" \"Willard hates embarrassment,\" I said. \"He\u0027s going to be nervous about image.\" \"Columbia\u0027s image? What does he care?\" \"The army\u0027s image,\" I said. \"Willard won\u0027t want Brubaker put next to whores and crack dealers. Not an elite colonel. He figures this Soviet stuff is going to shake things up. He figures we need good PR right now. He figures he can see the big picture.\" \"The big picture is I can\u0027t get near this case anyway. So what kind of pull does he have with the Columbia PD and the FBI? Because that\u0027s what it\u0027s going to take.\" \"Just be ready for trouble,\" I said. \"Are we in for seven lean years?\" \"Not that long.\" \"Why not?\" \"Just a feeling,\" I said. \"You happy with me handling liaison down here? Or should I get them to call you direct? Brubaker is your dead guy, technically.\" \"You do it,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got other things to do.\" We hung up and I went back to Summer\u0027s lists. Nine hundred seventy-three. Nine hundred seventy-two innocent, one guilty. But which one? Summer came back inside another hour. She walked in and gave me a sheet of paper. It was a photocopy of a weapons requisition that Sergeant First Class Christopher Carbone had made four months ago. It was for a Heckler amp; Koch P7 handgun. Maybe he had liked the H amp;K submachine guns Delta was using, and therefore he wanted the P7 for his personal sidearm. He had asked for it to be chambered for the standard nine-millimeter Parabellum cartridge. He had asked for the thirteen-round magazine, and three spares. It was a perfectly standard requisition form, and a perfectly reasonable request. I was sure it had been granted. There would have been no political sensitivities. H amp;K was a German outfit and Germany was a NATO country, last time I checked. There would have been no compatibility issues either. Nine-millimeter Parabellums were standard NATO loads. The U.S. Army had no shortage of them. We had warehouses crammed full of them. We could have filled thirteen-round magazines with them a million times over, every day for the rest of history. \"So?\" I said. \"Look at the signature on it,\" Summer said. She took my copy of Carbone\u0027s complaint out of her inside pocket and handed it over. I spread it out on my desk, side by side with the requisition form. Looked from one to the other. The two signatures were identical. \"We\u0027re not handwriting experts,\" I said. \"We don\u0027t need to be. They\u0027re the same, Reacher. Believe it.\" I nodded. Both signatures read C. Carbone, and the four capital letter Cs were very distinctive. They were fast, elongated, curling flourishes. The lower-case e on the end of each sample was distinctive too. It made a small round shape, and then the tail of the letter whipped way out to the right of the page, well beyond the name itself, horizontally, and exuberantly. The a-r-b-o-n in the middle was fast and fluid and linear. As a whole it was a bold, proud, legible, self-confident signature, developed no doubt by long years of signing checks and bar bills and leases and car papers. No signature was impossible to forge, of course, but I figured this one would have been a real challenge. A challenge that I guessed would have been impossible to meet between midnight and 0845 on a North Carolina army post. \"OK,\" I said. \"The complaint is genuine.\" I left it on the desk. Summer reversed it and read it through, although she must have read it plenty of times already. \"It\u0027s cold,\" she said. \"It\u0027s like a knife in the back.\" \"It\u0027s weird,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what it is. I never met this guy before. I\u0027m absolutely sure of that. And he was Delta. Not too many gentle pacifist souls over there. Why would he be offended? It wasn\u0027t his leg I broke.\" \"Maybe it was personal. Maybe the fat guy was his friend.\" I shook my head. \"He\u0027d have stepped in. He\u0027d have stopped the fight.\" \"It\u0027s the only complaint he ever made in a sixteen-year career.\" \"You been talking to people?\" \"All kinds of people. Right here, and by phone far and wide.\" \"Were you careful?\" \"Very. And it\u0027s the only complaint you ever had made against you.\" \"You checked that too?\" She nodded. \"All the way back to when God\u0027s dog was a puppy.\" \"You wanted to know what kind of a guy you\u0027re dealing with here?\" \"No, I wanted to be able to show the Delta guys you don\u0027t have a history. With Carbone or with anyone else.\" \"You\u0027re protecting me now?\" \"Someone\u0027s going to have to. I was just over there, and they\u0027re plenty mad.\" I nodded. Brubaker. \"I\u0027m sure they are,\" I said. I pictured Delta\u0027s lonely prison barracks, first designed to keep people in, then used to keep strangers out, now serving to keep their unity boiling like a pressure cooker. I pictured Brubaker\u0027s office, wherever it was, quiet and deserted. I pictured Carbone\u0027s cell, standing empty. \"So where was Carbone\u0027s new P7?\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t find it in his quarters.\" \"In their armory,\" Summer said. \"Cleaned, oiled, and loaded. They check their personal weapons in and out. They\u0027ve got a cage inside their hangar. You should see that place. It\u0027s like Santa\u0027s grotto. Special armored Humvees wall to wall, trucks, explosives, grenade launchers, claymores, night vision stuff. They could equip a Central African dictatorship all by themselves.\" \"That\u0027s very reassuring,\" I said. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"Why did he file the complaint?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. I pictured Carbone in the strip club, New Year\u0027s night. I had walked in and I had seen a group of four men I took to be sergeants. The swirl of the crowd had turned three of them away from me and one of them toward me in a completely random dynamic. I hadn\u0027t known who was going to be there, they hadn\u0027t known I was going to show up. I had never met any of them before. The encounter was as close to pure chance as it was possible to get. Yet Carbone had tagged me for the kind of tame mayhem he must have seen a thousand times before. The kind of tame mayhem he must have joined in with a hundred times before. Show me an enlisted man who claims never to have fought a civilian in a bar, and I\u0027ll show you a liar. \"Are you Catholic?\" I asked. \"No, why?\" Summer said. \"I wondered if you knew any Latin.\" \"It\u0027s not just Catholics who know Latin. I went to school.\" \"OK, cui bono?\" I said. \"Who benefits? What, from the complaint?\" \"It\u0027s always a good guide to motive,\" I said. \"You can explain most things with it. History, politics, everything.\" \"Like, follow the money?\" \"Approximately,\" I said. \"Except I don\u0027t think there\u0027s money involved here. But there must have been some benefit for Carbone. Otherwise why would he do it?\" \"Could have been a moral thing. Maybe he was driven to do it.\" \"Not if it was his first complaint in sixteen years. He must have seen far worse. I only broke one leg and one nose. It was no kind of a big deal. This is the army, Summer. I assume he hadn\u0027t been confusing it with a gardening club all these years.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said again. I slid her the slip of paper with 973 written on it. \"That\u0027s our suspect pool,\" I said. \"He was in the bar until eight o\u0027clock,\" she said. \"I checked that too. He left alone. Nobody saw him again after that.\" \"Anyone say anything about his mood?\" \"Delta guys don\u0027t have moods. Too much danger of appearing human.\" \"Had he been drinking?\" \"One beer.\" \"So he just walked out of the mess at eight, no nerves, no worries?\" \"Apparently so.\" \"He knew the guy he was meeting,\" I said. Summer said nothing. \"Sanchez called again while you were out,\" I said. \"Colonel Brubaker was shot in the back of the head. A double tap, close in, from behind.\" \"So he knew the guy he was meeting too.\" \"Very likely,\" I said. \"One twenty-three in the morning. Bullet caught his watch. Between three and a half and four and a half hours after Carbone.\" \"That puts you in the clear with Delta. You were still here at one twenty-three.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I was. With Norton.\" \"I\u0027ll spread the word.\" \"They won\u0027t believe you.\" \"Do you think there\u0027s a connection between Carbone and Brubaker?\" \"Common sense says there has to be. But I don\u0027t see how. And I don\u0027t see why. I mean, sure, they were both Delta soldiers. But Carbone was here and Brubaker was there, and Brubaker was a high-profile mover and shaker, and Carbone was a nobody who kept himself to himself. Maybe because he thought he had to.\" \"You think we\u0027ll ever have gays in the military?\" \"We\u0027ve already got gays in the military. We always have had. World War Two, the Western Allies had fourteen million men in uniform. Any kind of reasonable probability says at least a million of them were gay. And we won that war, as I recall, last time I checked with the history books. We won it big time.\" \"It\u0027s a hell of a step,\" she said. \"They took the same step when they let black soldiers in. And women. Everyone pissed and moaned about that too. Bad for morale, bad for unit cohesion. It was crap then and it\u0027s crap now. Right? You\u0027re here and you\u0027re doing OK.\" \"Are you a Catholic?\" I shook my head. \"My mother taught us the Latin. She cared about our education. She taught us things, me and my brother, Joe.\" \"You should call her.\" \"Why?\" \"To see how her leg is.\" \"Maybe later,\" I said. I went back to the personnel lists and Summer went out and came back in with a map of the Eastern United States. She taped it flat to the wall below the clock and marked our location at Fort Bird with a red push-pin. Then she marked Columbia, South Carolina, where Brubaker had been found. Then she marked Raleigh, North Carolina, where he had been playing golf with his wife. I gave her a clear plastic ruler from my desk drawer and she checked the map\u0027s scale and started calculating times and distances. \"Bear in mind most of us don\u0027t drive as fast as you do,\" I said. \"None of you drive as fast as I do,\" she said. She measured four and a half inches between Raleigh and Columbia and called it five to allow for the way U.S. 1 snaked slightly. She held the ruler against the scale in the legend box. \"Two hundred miles,\" she said. \"So if Brubaker left Raleigh after dinner, he could have been in Columbia by midnight, easily. An hour or so before he died.\" Then she checked the distance between Fort Bird and Columbia. She came up with a hundred and fifty miles, less than I had originally guessed. \"Three hours,\" she said. \"To be comfortable.\" Then she looked at me. \"It could have been the same guy,\" she said. \"If Carbone was killed at nine or ten, the same guy could have been in Columbia at midnight or one, ready for Brubaker.\" She put her little finger on the Fort Bird pin. \"Carbone,\" she said. Then she spanned her hand and put her index finger on the Columbia pin. \"Brubaker,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a definite sequence.\" \"It\u0027s a definite guess,\" I said. She didn\u0027t reply. \"Do we know that Brubaker drove down from Raleigh?\" I said. \"We can assume he did.\" \"We should check with Sanchez,\" I said. \"See if they found his car anywhere. See if his wife says he took it with him in the first place.\" \"OK,\" she said. She went out to my sergeant\u0027s desk to make the call. Left me with the interminable personnel lists. She came back in ten minutes later. \"He took his car,\" she said. \"His wife told Sanchez they had two cars up at the hotel. His and hers. They always did it that way because he was always rushing off somewhere and she was always concerned about getting stuck.\" \"What kind of car?\" I said. I figured she would have asked. \"Chevy Impala SS.\" \"Nice car.\" \"He left after dinner and his wife\u0027s assumption was that he was driving back here to Bird. That would have been normal. But the car hasn\u0027t turned up anyplace yet. At least, not according to the Columbia PD and the FBI.\" \"OK,\" I said. \"Sanchez thinks they\u0027re holding out on him, like they know something we don\u0027t.\" \"That would be normal too.\" \"He\u0027s pressing them. But it\u0027s difficult.\" \"It always is.\" \"He\u0027ll call us,\" she said. \"As soon as he gets anywhere.\" We got a call thirty minutes later. But not from Sanchez. Not about Brubaker or Carbone. The call was from Detective Clark, in Green Valley, Virginia. It was about Mrs. Kramer\u0027s case. \"Got something,\" he said. He sounded very pleased with himself. He launched into a blow-by-blow account of the moves he had made. They sounded reasonably intelligent. He had used a map to figure out all the likely approaches to Green Valley from as much as three hundred miles away. Then he had used phone books to compile a list of hardware sources that lay along those approaches. He had started his guys calling them all, one by one, beginning right in the center of the spiderweb. He had figured that crowbar sales would be slow in winter. Major remodeling happens from springtime onward. Nobody wants their walls torn down for kitchen extensions when the weather is cold. So he had expected to get very few positive reports. After three hours he had gotten none at all. People had spent the post-Christmas period buying power drills and electric screwdrivers. Some had bought chainsaws, to keep their wood-burning stoves going. Those with pioneer fantasies had bought axes. But nobody had been interested in inert and prosaic things like crowbars. So he made a lateral jump and fired up his crime databases. Originally he planned to look for reports of other crimes that involved doors and crowbars. He thought that might narrow down a location. He didn\u0027t find anything that matched his parameters. But instead, right there on his NCIC computer, he found a burglary at a small hardware store in Sperryville, Virginia. The store was a lonely place on a dead-end street. According to the owner the front window had been kicked in sometime in the early hours of New Year\u0027s Day. Because it was a holiday, there had been no money left in the register. As far as the store owner could tell, the only thing that had been stolen was a single crowbar. Summer stepped back to the map on the wall and put a pushpin through the center of Sperryville, Virginia. Sperryville was a small place and the plastic barrel of the pin obscured it completely. Then she put another pin through Green Valley. The two pins finished up about a quarter-inch apart. They were almost touching. They represented about ten miles of separation. \"Look at this,\" Summer said. I got up and stepped over. Looked at the map. Sperryville was on the elbow of a crooked road that ran southwest to Green Valley and beyond. In the other direction it didn\u0027t really go anywhere at all except Washington D.C. So Summer put a pin in Washington D.C. She put the tip of her little finger on it. Put her middle finger on Sperryville and her index finger on Green Valley. \"Vassell and Coomer,\" she said. \"They left D.C., they stole the crowbar in Sperryville, they broke into Mrs. Kramer\u0027s house in Green Valley.\" \"Except they didn\u0027t,\" I said. \"They were just in from the airport. They didn\u0027t have a car. And they didn\u0027t call for one. You checked the phone records yourself.\" She said nothing. \"Plus they\u0027re lard-ass staff officers,\" I said. \"They wouldn\u0027t know how to burgle a hardware store if their lives depended on it.\" She took her hand off the map. I stepped back to my desk and sat down again and butted the personnel lists into a neat pile. \"We need to concentrate on Carbone,\" I said. \"Then we need a new plan,\" she said. \"Detective Clark is going to stop looking for crowbars now. He\u0027s found the one he\u0027s interested in.\" I nodded. \"Back to traditional time-honored methods of investigation.\" \"Which are?\" \"I don\u0027t really know. I went to West Point. I didn\u0027t go to MP school.\" My phone rang. I picked it up. The same warm Southern voice I had heard before went through the same 10-33, 10-16 from Jackson routine I had heard before. I acknowledged and hit the speaker button and leaned all the way back in my chair and waited. The room filled with electronic hum. Then there was a click. \"Reacher?\" Sanchez said. \"And Lieutenant Summer,\" I said. \"We\u0027re on the speaker.\" \"Anyone else in the room?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Door closed?\" \"Yes. What\u0027s up?\" \"Columbia PD came through again, is what. They\u0027re feeding me stuff bit by bit. And they\u0027re having themselves a real good time doing it. They\u0027re gloating like crazy.\" \"Why?\" \"Because Brubaker had heroin in his pocket, that\u0027s why. Three dime bags of brown. And a big wad of cash money. They\u0027re saying it was a drug deal that went bad.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-14.html","bookId":2346,"book":{"id":2346,"title":"The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8)","description":"Storyline: The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8) Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case. New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall. Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:16 AM"}}
