{"id":66267,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I put the phone down and saw a note my sergeant had left me: Your brother called. No message. I folded the note once and dropped it in the trash. Then I headed back to my quarters and got three hours\u0027 sleep. Got up again fifty minutes before first light. I was back at the motel just as dawn was breaking. Morning didn\u0027t make the neighborhood look any better. It was depressed and abandoned for miles around. And quiet. Nothing was stirring. Dawn on New Year\u0027s Day is as close as any inhabited place gets to absolute stillness. The highway was deserted. There was no traffic. None at all. The diner at the truck stop was open but empty. The motel office was empty. I walked down the row to the last-but-one room. Kramer\u0027s room. The door was locked. I stood with my back to it and pretended I was a hooker whose client had just died. I had pushed his weight off me and dressed fast and grabbed his briefcase and I was running away with it. What would I do? I wasn\u0027t interested in the briefcase itself. I wanted the cash in the wallet, and maybe the American Express card. So I would rifle through and grab the cash and the card and ditch the bag itself. But where would I do that? Inside the room would have been best. But I hadn\u0027t done it there, for some reason. Maybe I was panicking. Maybe I was shocked and spooked and just wanted to get the hell out, fast. So where else? I looked straight ahead at the lounge bar. That was probably where I was going. That was probably where I was based. But I wouldn\u0027t carry the briefcase in there. My co-workers would notice, because I was already carrying a big purse. Hookers always carry big purses. They\u0027ve got a lot of stuff to haul around. Condoms, massage oils, maybe a gun or a knife, maybe a credit card machine. That\u0027s the easiest way to spot a hooker. Look for someone dressed like she\u0027s going to a ball, carrying a bag like she\u0027s going on vacation. I looked to my left. Maybe I walked around behind the motel. It would be quiet back there. All the windows faced that way, but it was night and I could count on the drapes being closed. I turned left and left again and came out behind the bedrooms on a rectangle of scrubby weeds that ran the length of the building and was about twenty feet deep. I imagined walking fast and then stopping in deep shadow and going through the bag by feel. I imagined finding what I wanted and heaving the bag away into the darkness. I might have thrown it thirty feet. I stood where she might have stood and scoped out a quarter circle. It gave me about a hundred and fifty square feet to check. The ground was stony and nearly frozen by overnight frost. I found plenty of stuff. I found trash and used needles and foil crack pipes and a Buick hubcap and a skateboard wheel. But I didn\u0027t find a briefcase. There was a wooden fence at the rear of the lot. It was about six feet tall. I jacked myself up on it and looked over. Saw another rectangle of weeds and stones. No briefcase. I got down off the fence and walked onward and came up on the motel office from the back. There was a window made of dirty pebbled glass that I guessed let into the staff bathroom. Underneath it were a dozen trashed air conditioners all stacked in a low pile. They were rusty. They hadn\u0027t been moved in years. I walked on and came around the corner and turned left into a weedy gravel patch with a Dumpster on it. I opened the lid. It was three-quarters full of garbage. No briefcase. I crossed the street and walked through the empty lot and looked at the lounge bar. It was silent and closed up tight. Its neon signs were all switched off and the little bent tubes looked cold and dead. It had its own Dumpster, close by in the lot, just sitting there like a parked vehicle. There was no briefcase in it. I ducked inside the greasy spoon. It was still empty. I checked the floor around the tables and the banquettes in the booths. I looked on the floor behind the register. There was a cardboard box back there with a couple of forlorn umbrellas in it. But no briefcase. I checked the women\u0027s bathroom. No women in it. No briefcase in it either. I looked at my watch and walked back to the bar. I would need to ask some face-to-face questions there. But it wouldn\u0027t be open for business for another eight hours at least. I turned around and looked across the street at the motel. There was still nobody in the office. So I headed back to my Humvee and got there in time to hear a 10-17 come in on the radio. Return to base. So I acknowledged and fired up the big diesel and drove all the way back to Bird. There was no traffic and I made it inside forty minutes. I saw Kramer\u0027s rental parked in the motor pool lot. There was a new person at the desk outside my borrowed office. A corporal. The day shift. He was a small dark guy who looked like he was from Louisiana. French blood in there, certainly. I know French blood when I see it. \"Your brother called again,\" the corporal said. \"Why?\" \"No message.\" \"What was the ten-seventeen for?\" \"Colonel Garber requests a ten-nineteen.\" I smiled. You could live your whole life saying nothing but 10-this and 10-that. Sometimes I felt like I already had. A 10-19 was a contact by phone or radio. Less serious than a 10-16, which was a contact by secure landline. Colonel Garber requests a 10-19 meant Garber wants you to call him, was all. Some MP units get in the habit of speaking English, but clearly this one hadn\u0027t yet. I stepped into my office and saw Kramer\u0027s suit carrier propped against the wall and a carton containing his shoes and underwear and hat sitting next to it. His uniform was still on three hangers. They were hung one in front of the other on my coatrack. I walked past them to my borrowed desk and dialed Garber\u0027s number. Listened to the purr of the ring tone and wondered what my brother wanted. Wondered how he had tracked me down. I had been in Panama sixty hours ago. Before that I had been all over the place. So he had made a big effort to find me. So maybe it was important. I picked up a pencil and wrote Joe on a slip of paper. Then I underlined it, twice. \"Yes?\" Leon Garber said in my ear. \"Reacher here,\" I said. The clock on the wall showed a little after nine in the morning. Kramer\u0027s onward connection to LAX was already in the air. \"It was a heart attack,\" Garber said. \"No question.\" \"Walter Reed worked fast.\" \"He was a general.\" \"But a general with a bad heart.\" \"Bad arteries, actually. Severe arteriosclerosis leading to fatal ventricular fibrillation. That\u0027s what they\u0027re telling us. And I believe them too. Probably kicked in around the time the whore took her bra off.\" \"He wasn\u0027t carrying any pills.\" \"It was probably undiagnosed. It\u0027s one of those things. You feel fine, then you feel dead. No way it could be faked, anyway. You could simulate fibrillation with an electric shock, I guess, but you can\u0027t simulate forty years\u0027 worth of crap in the arteries.\" \"Were we worried about it being faked?\" \"There could have been KGB interest,\" Garber said. \"Kramer and his tanks are the biggest single tactical problem the Red Army is facing.\" \"Right now the Red Army is facing the other way.\" \"Kind of early to say whether that\u0027s permanent or not.\" I didn\u0027t reply. The phone went quiet. \"I can\u0027t let anyone else touch this with a stick,\" Garber said. \"Not just yet. Because of the circumstances. You understand that, right?\" \"So?\" \"So you\u0027re going to have to do the widow thing,\" Garber said. \"Me? Isn\u0027t she in Germany?\" \"She\u0027s in Virginia. She\u0027s home for the holidays. They have a house there.\" He gave me the address and I wrote it on the slip of paper, directly underneath where I had underlined Joe. \"Anyone with her?\" I asked. \"They don\u0027t have kids. So she\u0027s probably alone.\" \"OK,\" I said. \"She doesn\u0027t know yet,\" Garber said. \"Took me a while to track her down.\" \"Want me to take a priest?\" \"It isn\u0027t a combat death. You could take a female partner, I guess. Mrs. Kramer might be a hugger.\" \"OK.\" \"Spare her the details, obviously. He was en route to Irwin, is all. Croaked in a layover hotel. We need to make that the official line. Nobody except you and me knows any different yet, and that\u0027s the way we\u0027re going to keep it. Except you can tell whoever you partner with, I guess. Mrs. Kramer might ask questions, and you\u0027ll need to be on the same page. What about the local cops? Are they going to leak?\" \"The guy I saw was an ex-Marine. He knows the score.\" \"Semper Fi,\" Garber said. \"I didn\u0027t find the briefcase yet,\" I said. The phone went quiet again. \"Do the widow thing first,\" Garber said. \"Then keep on looking for it.\" I told the day-shift corporal to move Kramer\u0027s effects to my quarters. I wanted to keep them safe and sound. The widow would ask for them, eventually. And things can disappear, on a big base like Bird, which can be embarrassing. Then I walked over to the O Club and looked for MPs eating late breakfasts or early lunches. They usually cluster well away from everybody else, because everybody else hates them. I found a group of four, two men and two women. They were all in woodland-pattern BDUs, standard on-post dress. One of the women was a captain. She had her right arm in a sling. She was having trouble eating. She would have trouble driving too. The other woman had a lieutenant\u0027s bar on each lapel and Summer on her nametape. She looked to be about twenty-five years old and she was short and slender. She had skin the same color as the mahogany table she was eating off. \"Lieutenant Summer,\" I said. \"Sir?\" \"Happy New Year,\" I said. \"Sir, you too.\" \"You busy today?\" \"Sir, general duties.\" \"OK, out front in thirty minutes, Class As. I need you to hug a widow.\" I put my own Class As on again and called the motor pool for a sedan. I didn\u0027t want to ride all the way to Virginia in a Humvee. Too noisy, too uncomfortable. A private brought me a new olive-green Chevrolet. I signed for it and drove it around to post headquarters and waited. Lieutenant Summer came out halfway through the twenty-eighth minute of her allotted thirty. She paused a second and then walked toward the car. She looked good. She was very short, but she moved easily, like a willowy person. She looked like a six-foot catwalk model reduced in size to a tiny miniature. I got out of the car and left the driver\u0027s door open. Met her on the sidewalk. She was wearing an expert sharpshooter badge with bars for rifle, small bore rifle, auto rifle, pistol, small bore pistol, machine gun, and submachine gun hanging on it. They made a little ladder about two inches long. Longer than mine. I only have rifle and pistol. She stopped dead in front of me and came to attention and fired off a perfect salute. \"Sir, Lieutenant Summer reports,\" she said. \"Take it easy,\" I said. \"Informal mode of address, OK? Call me Reacher, or nothing. And no saluting. I don\u0027t like it.\" She paused. Relaxed. \"OK,\" she said. I opened the passenger door and started to get in. \"I\u0027m driving?\" she asked. \"I was up most of the night.\" \"Who died?\" \"General Kramer,\" I said. \"Big tank guy in Europe.\" She paused again. \"So why was he here? We\u0027re all infantry.\" \"Passing through,\" I said. She got in on the other side and racked the driver\u0027s seat all the way forward. Adjusted the mirror. I pushed the passenger seat back and got as comfortable as I could. \"Where to?\" she said. \" Green Valley, Virginia,\" I said. \"It\u0027ll be about four hours, I guess.\" \"That\u0027s where the widow is?\" \"Home for the holidays,\" I said. \"And we\u0027re breaking the news? Like, Happy New Year, ma\u0027am, and by the way, your husband\u0027s dead?\" I nodded. \"Lucky us.\" But I wasn\u0027t really worried. Generals\u0027 wives are as tough as they come. Either they\u0027ve spent thirty years pushing their husbands up the greasy pole, or they\u0027ve endured thirty years of fallout as their husbands have climbed it for themselves. Either way, there\u0027s not much left that can get to them. They\u0027re tougher than the generals, most of the time. Summer took her cap off and tossed it onto the backseat. Her hair was very short. Almost shaved. She had a delicate skull and nice cheekbones. Smooth skin. I liked the way she looked. And she was a fast driver. That was for damn sure. She clipped her belt and took off north like she was training for NASCAR. \"Was it an accident?\" she asked. \"Heart attack,\" I said. \"His arteries were bad.\" \"Where? Our VOQ?\" I shook my head. \"A crappy little motel in town. He died with a twenty-dollar hooker wedged somewhere underneath him.\" \"We\u0027re not telling the widow that part, right?\" \"No, we\u0027re not. We\u0027re not telling anyone that part.\" \"Why was he passing through?\" \"He didn\u0027t come to Bird itself. He was transiting D.C. Frankfurt to Dulles, then National to LAX twenty hours later. He was going out to Irwin for a conference.\" \"OK,\" she said, and then she went very quiet. We drove on. We got about level with the motel, but well to the west, heading straight for the highway. \"Permission to speak freely?\" she said. \"Please,\" I said. \"Is this a test?\" \"Why would it be a test?\" \"You\u0027re from the 110th Special Unit, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I am.\" \"I have an application pending.\" \"To the 110th?\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"So, is this a covert assessment?\" \"Of what?\" \"Of me,\" she said. \"As a candidate.\" \"I needed a woman partner. In case the widow is a hugger. I picked you out at random. The captain with the busted arm couldn\u0027t have driven the car. And it would be kind of inefficient for us to wait until we had a dead general to conduct personnel assessments.\" \"I guess,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m wondering if you\u0027re sitting there waiting for me to ask the obvious questions.\" \"I\u0027d expect any MP with a pulse to ask the obvious questions, whether or not they had a special unit transfer pending.\" \"OK, I\u0027m asking. General Kramer had a twenty-hour layover in the D.C. area and he wanted to get his rocks off and he didn\u0027t mind paying for the privilege. So why did he drive all the way down here to do it? It\u0027s what, three hundred miles?\" \"Two hundred and ninety-eight,\" I said. \"And then he\u0027d have to drive all the way back.\" \"Clearly.\" \"So why?\" \"You tell me,\" I said. \"Come up with something I haven\u0027t thought of myself and I\u0027ll recommend you for the transfer.\" \"You can\u0027t. You\u0027re not my CO.\" \"Maybe I am,\" I said. \"This week, anyway.\" \"Why are you even here? Is something happening I should know about?\" \"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m here,\" I said. \"I got orders. That\u0027s all I know.\" \"Are you really a major?\" \"Last time I checked,\" I said. \"I thought 110th investigators were usually warrant officers. Working plain clothes or undercover.\" \"They usually are.\" \"So why bring you here when they could send a warrant officer and have him dress up as a major?\" \"Good question,\" I said. \"Maybe one day I\u0027ll find out.\" \"May I ask what your orders were?\" \"Temporary detached duty as Fort Bird \u0027s Provost Marshal\u0027s executive officer.\" \"The Provost Marshal isn\u0027t on-post,\" she said. \"I know,\" I said. \"I found that out. He transferred out the same day I transferred in. Some temporary thing.\" \"So you\u0027re acting CO.\" \"Like I said.\" \"MP XO isn\u0027t a special unit job,\" she said. \"I can fake it,\" I said. \"I started out a regular MP, just like you.\" Summer said nothing. Just drove. \"Kramer,\" I said. \"Why did he contemplate a six-hundred-mile round-trip? That\u0027s twelve hours\u0027 driving time out of his twenty. Just to spend fifteen bucks on a room and twenty on a whore?\" \"Why does it matter? A heart attack is a heart attack, right? I mean, was there any question about it?\" I shook my head. \"Walter Reed already did the autopsy.\" \"So it doesn\u0027t really matter where or when it happened.\" \"His briefcase is missing.\" \"I see,\" Summer said. I saw her thinking. Her lower eyelids flicked upward a fraction. \"How do you know he had a briefcase?\" she said. \"I don\u0027t. But did you ever see a general go to a conference without one?\" \"No,\" she said. \"You think the hooker ran off with it?\" I nodded. \"That\u0027s my working hypothesis right now.\" \"So, find the hooker.\" \"Who was she?\" Her eyelids moved again. \"Doesn\u0027t make sense,\" she said. I nodded again. \"Exactly.\" \"Four possible reasons Kramer didn\u0027t stay in the D.C. area. One, he might have been traveling with fellow officers and didn\u0027t want to embarrass himself in front of them by having a hooker come to his room. They might have seen her in the corridor or heard her through the walls. So he invented an excuse and stayed in a different place. Two, even if he was traveling alone he might have been on a DoD travel voucher and he was paranoid about a desk clerk seeing the girl and calling The Washington Post. That happens. So he preferred to pay cash in some anonymous dive. Three, even if he wasn\u0027t on a government ticket he might have been a well-known guest or a familiar face in a big-city hotel. So likewise he was looking for anonymity somewhere out of town. Or four, his sexual tastes ran beyond what you can get from the D.C. Yellow Pages, so he had to go where he knew for sure he could get what he wanted.\" \"But?\" \"Problems one, two, and three could be answered by going ten or fifteen miles, maybe less. Two hundred and ninety-eight is completely excessive. And whereas I\u0027m prepared to believe there are tastes that can\u0027t be satisfied in D.C., I don\u0027t see how they\u0027re more likely to be satisfied way out here in the North Carolina boonies, and anyway I would guess such a thing would cost a lot more than twenty bucks wherever you eventually found it.\" \"So why did he take the six-hundred-mile detour?\" She didn\u0027t answer. Just drove, and thought. I closed my eyes. Kept them closed for about thirty-five miles. \"He knew the girl,\" Summer said. I opened my eyes. \"How?\" \"Some men have favorites. Maybe he met her a long time ago. Fell for her, in a way. It can happen like that. It can almost be a love thing.\" \"Where would he have met her?\" \"Right there.\" \"Bird is all infantry. He was Armored Branch.\" \"Maybe they had joint exercises. You should check back.\" I said nothing. Armored and the infantry run joint exercises all the time. But they run them where the tanks are, not where the grunts are. Much easier to transport men across a continent than tanks. \"Or maybe he met her at Irwin,\" Summer said. \"In California. Maybe she worked Irwin, but had to leave California for some reason, but she liked working military bases, so she moved to Bird.\" \"What kind of a hooker would like working military bases?\" \"The kind that\u0027s interested in money. Which is all of them, presumably. Military bases support their local economies in all kinds of ways.\" I said nothing. \"Or maybe she always worked Bird, but followed the infantry to Irwin when they did a joint exercise out there one time. Those things can last a month or two. No point in hanging around at home with no customers.\" \"Best guess?\" I said. \"They met in California,\" she said. \"Kramer will have spent years at Irwin, on and off. Then she moved to North Carolina, but he still liked her enough to make the detour whenever he was in D.C.\" \"She doesn\u0027t do anything special, not for twenty bucks.\" \"Maybe he didn\u0027t need anything special.\" \"We could ask the widow.\" Summer smiled. \"Maybe he just liked her. Maybe she made damn sure he did. Hookers are good at that. They like repeat customers best of all. It\u0027s much safer for them if they already know the guy.\" I closed my eyes again. \"So?\" Summer said. \"Did I come up with something you didn\u0027t think of?\" \"No,\" I said. I fell asleep before we were out of the state and woke up again nearly four hours later when Summer took the Green Valley ramp too fast. My head rolled to the right and hit the window. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"You should check Kramer\u0027s phone records. He must have called ahead, to make sure she was around. He wouldn\u0027t have driven all that way on the off chance.\" \"Where would he have called from?\" \" Germany,\" she said. \"Before he left.\" \"More likely he used a pay phone at Dulles. But we\u0027ll check.\" \"We?\" \"You can partner with me.\" She said nothing. \"Like a test,\" I said. \"Is this important?\" \"Probably not. But it might be. Depends what the conference is about. Depends what paperwork he was taking to it. He might have had the whole ETO order of battle in his case. Or new tactics, assessment of shortcomings, all kinds of classified stuff.\" \"The Red Army is going to fold.\" I nodded. \"I\u0027m more worried about red faces. Newspapers, or television. Some reporter finds classified stuff on a trash pile near a strip club, there\u0027ll be major embarrassment all around.\" \"Maybe the widow will know. He might have discussed it with her.\" \"We can\u0027t ask her,\" I said. \"As far as she\u0027s concerned he died in his sleep with the blanket pulled up to his chin, and everything else was kosher. Any worries we\u0027ve got at this point stay strictly between me, you, and Garber.\" \"Garber?\" she said. \"Me, you, and him,\" I said. I saw her smile. It was a trivial case, but working it with Garber was a definite stroke of luck, for a person with a 110th Special Unit transfer pending. Green Valley was a picture-perfect colonial town and the Kramer house was a neat old place in an expensive part of it. It was a Victorian confection with fish-scale tiles on the roof and a bunch of turrets and porches all painted white, sitting on a couple of acres of emerald lawn. There were stately evergreen trees dotted about. They looked like someone had positioned them with care, which they probably had, a hundred years ago. We pulled up at the curb and waited, just looking. I don\u0027t know what Summer was thinking about, but I was scanning the scene and filing it away under A for America. I have a Social Security number and the same blue and silver passport as everyone else but between my old man\u0027s Stateside tours and my own I can only put together about five years\u0027 worth of actual residence in the continental U.S. So I know a bunch of basic elementary-school facts like state capitals and how many grand slams Lou Gehrig hit and some basic high-school stuff like the constitutional amendments and the importance of Antietam, but I don\u0027t know much about the price of milk or how to work a pay phone or how different places look and smell. So I soak it up when I can. And the Kramer house was worth soaking up. That was for sure. A watery sun was shining on it. There was a faint breeze and the smell of woodsmoke in the air and a kind of intense cold-afternoon quiet all around us. It was the kind of place you would have wanted your grandparents to live. You could have visited in the fall and raked leaves and drunk apple cider and then come back in the summer and loaded a ten-year-old station wagon with a canoe and headed for a lake somewhere. It reminded me of the places in the picture books they gave me in Manila and Guam and Seoul. Until we got inside. \"Ready?\" Summer said. \"Sure,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s do it. Let\u0027s do the widow thing.\" She was quiet. I was sure she had done it before. I had too, more than once. It was never fun. She pulled off the curb and headed for the driveway entrance. Drove slowly toward the front door and eased to a stop ten feet from it. We opened our doors together and slid out into the chill and straightened our jackets. We left our hats in the car. That would be Mrs. Kramer\u0027s first clue, if she happened to be watching. A pair of MPs at your door is never good news, and if they\u0027re bareheaded, it\u0027s worse news. This particular door was painted a dull antique red and it had a glass storm screen in front of it. I rang the bell and we waited. And waited. I started to think nobody was home. I rang the bell again. The breeze was cold. It was stronger than it had looked. \"We should have called ahead,\" Summer said. \"Can\u0027t,\" I said. \"Can\u0027t say, please be there four hours from now so we can deliver some very important news face-to-face. Too much of a preview, wouldn\u0027t you say?\" \"I came all this way and I\u0027ve got nobody to hug.\" \"Sounds like a country song. Then your truck breaks down and your dog dies.\" I tried the bell again. No response. \"We should look for a vehicle,\" Summer said. We found one in a closed two-car garage standing separate from the house. We could see it through the window. It was a Mercury Grand Marquis, metallic green, as long as an ocean liner. It was the perfect car for a general\u0027s wife. Not new, not old, premium but not overpriced, suitable color, American as hell. \"Think this is hers?\" Summer asked. \"Probably,\" I said. \"Chances are they had a Ford until he made lieutenant colonel. Then they moved up to a Mercury. They were probably waiting for the third star before they thought about a Lincoln.\" \"Sad.\" \"You think? Don\u0027t forget where he was last night.\" \"So where is she? You think she went out walking?\" We turned around and felt the breeze on our backs and heard a door bang at the rear of the house. \"She was out in the yard,\" Summer said. \"Gardening, maybe.\" \"Nobody gardens on New Year\u0027s Day,\" I said. \"Not in this hemisphere. There\u0027s nothing growing.\" But we walked around to the front anyway and tried the bell again. Better to let her meet us formally, on her own terms. But she didn\u0027t show. Then we heard the door again, at the back, banging aimlessly. Like the breeze had gotten hold of it. \"We should check that out,\" Summer said. I nodded. A banging door has a sound all its own. It suggests all kinds of things. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We probably should.\" We walked around to the rear of the house, side by side, into the wind. There was a flagstone path. It led us to a kitchen door. It opened inward, and it must have had a spring on the back to keep it closed. The spring must have been a little weak, because the gusting breeze was overpowering it from time to time and kicking the door open eight or nine inches. Then the gust would die away and the spring would reassert itself and the door would bang back into the frame. It did it three times as we watched. It was able to do it because the lock was smashed. It had been a good lock, made of steel. But the steel had been stronger than the surrounding wood. Someone had used a wrecking bar. It had been jerked hard, maybe twice, and the lock had held but the wood had splintered. The door had opened up and the lock had just fallen out of the wreckage. It was right there on the flagstone path. The door had a crescent-shaped bite out of it. Splinters of wood had been blown here and there and piled by the wind. \"What now?\" Summer said. There was no security system. No intruder alarm. No pads, no wires. No automatic call to the nearest police precinct. No way of telling if the bad guys were long gone, or if they were still inside. \"What now?\" Summer said again. We were unarmed. No weapons, on a formal visit in Class A uniform. \"Go cover the front,\" I said. \"In case anyone comes out.\" She moved away without a word and I gave her a minute to get in position. Then I pushed the door with my elbow and stepped inside the kitchen. Closed the door behind me and leaned on it to keep it shut. Then I stood still and listened. There was no sound. No sound at all. The kitchen smelled faintly of cooked vegetables and stewed coffee. It was big. It was halfway between tidy and untidy. A well-used space. There was a door on the other side of the room. On my right. It was open. I could see a small triangle of polished oak floor. A hallway. I moved very slowly. Crept forward and to the right to line up my view. The door banged again behind me. I saw more of the hallway. I figured it ran straight to the front entrance. Off of it to the left was a closed door. Probably a dining room. Off of it to the right was a den or a study. Its door was open. I could see a desk and a chair and dark wood bookcases. I took a cautious step. Moved a little more. I saw a dead woman on the hallway floor.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8/page-2.html","bookId":2346,"book":{"id":2346,"title":"The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8)","description":"Storyline: The Enemy (Jack Reacher #8) Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case. New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall. Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have. But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:16 AM"}}
