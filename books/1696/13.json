She must have.\n “Careful,” I say as Eden climbs up onto my bed and leans over to stand his new creation up at the edge of the window. His hands fumble around, feeling for the windowsill and the glass pane. “If you fall and break something, we’ll have to head back to the hospital, and I am not going to be happy about that.”\n “You’re thinking about her again, aren’t you?” Eden fires smoothly back. His blind eyes stay squinted at the blocks standing barely an inch from his face. “You always change your voice.”\n I blink at him in surprise. “What?”\n He looks in my direction and raises an eyebrow at me, and the expression looks comical on his childlike face. “Oh, come on. It’s so obvious. What’s this June girl to you, anyway? The whole country gossips about you two, and when she asked you to come to Denver, you couldn’t pack us up fast enough. You told me to call her in case the Republic ever comes to take me away. You’re gonna have to spill sooner or later, yeah? You’re always talking about her.”\n “I don’t talk about her all the time.”\n “Uh-huh, right.”\n I’m glad Eden can’t see my expression. I’ve yet to talk with him about June and her connection to the rest of our family—another good reason to stay away from her. “She’s a friend,” I finally reply.\n “Do you like her?”\n My eyes go back to studying the rainy scene outside our window. “Yeah.”\n Eden waits for me to say more, but when I remain silent, he shrugs and goes back to his robot. “Fine,” he mutters. “Tell me whenever.”\n As if on cue, my earpiece blares out a second of soft static, warning me of an incoming call. I accept it. A moment later, June’s whispered voice echoes in my ear. She doesn’t say anything about my illness—she just suggests, “Can we talk?”\n I knew it’d only be a matter of time before I heard from her. I watch Eden playing for a second longer. “We gotta do it somewhere else,” I whisper back. My brother glances at me, momentarily curious at my words. I don’t want to ruin my first day out of the hospital by breaking my depressing prognosis to an eleven-year-old.\n “How about a walk, then?”\n I glance out the window. It’s dinnertime, and the cafés down on the street’s ground level are crowded with patrons, almost all of them huddled under hats, caps, umbrellas, and hoods, keeping to themselves in this twilight slush. Might be a good time to walk around without attracting too much attention. “How about this. Come on over, and we’ll head out from here.”\n “Great,” June replies. She hangs up.\n Ten minutes later, my doorbell rings and startles Eden to his feet—the new cube robot he built falls from my bed, three of its limbs snapping off. Eden turns his eyes in my direction. “Who’s there?” he asks.\n “Don’t worry, kid,” I reply, walking over to the door. “It’s June.”\n Eden’s shoulders relax at my words; a bright grin lights up his face, and he hops off the edge of the bed, leaving his block robot by the window. He feels his way toward the other end of the bed. “Well?” he demands. “Aren’t you gonna let her in?”\n It seems like during the time I’d spent living on the streets, I’d been missing out on seeing Eden blossom. Quiet kid turned stubborn and headstrong. Can’t imagine how he inherited that. I sigh—I hate keeping things from him, but how do I explain this one? I’d told him over the past year who June is: a Republic girl who decided to help us out, a girl who’s now training to be the country’s future Princeps. I haven’t figured out yet how to tell him the rest—so I just don’t say anything about it at all.\n June doesn’t smile when I open the door. She glances at Eden, then back to me. “Is that your brother?” she says quietly.\n I nod. “You haven’t met him yet, have you?” I turn around and call out to him. “Eden. Manners.”\n Eden waves from the bed. “Hi,” he calls out.\n I step aside so that June can come in. She makes her way over to where Eden is, sits down next to him with a smile, and takes his small hand in hers. She shakes it twice. “Pleased to meet you, Eden,” she says, her voice gentle. I lean against the door to watch the exchange. “How are you doing?”\n Eden shrugs. “Pretty good, I guess,” he replies. “Doctors say my eyes have stabilized. I’m taking ten different pills every day.” He tilts his head. “But I think I’ve been getting stronger.” He puffs out his chest a little, then strikes a mock pose by flexing his arms. His eyes are unfocused and pointing slightly to the left of June’s face. “How do I look?”\n June laughs. “I have to say, you look better than most people I see. I’ve heard a lot about you.”\n “I hear about you a lot too,” Eden replies in a rush, “mostly from Daniel. He thinks you’re really hot.”\n “Okay, that’s enough.” I clear my throat loud enough for him to hear, then shoot him a cranky look even though he’s blind as a rock. “Let’s head out.”\n “Have you eaten yet?” she asks as we head toward the door. “I was supposed to be shadowing Anden with the other Princeps-Elects, but he’s been called to the Armor barracks for a quick briefing—something about food poisoning among the soldiers. So I had a couple of free hours.” A faint blush touches her cheeks as she says this. “I thought maybe we could grab a bite.”\n I raise an eyebrow. Then I lean in toward her so that my cheek brushes against hers—to my excitement, I feel her shiver at my touch. “Why, June,” I tease in a low, soft voice, smiling against her ear. “Are you asking me out on a date?”\n June’s blush deepens, but its warmth doesn’t touch her eyes.\n My moment of mischief ends. I clear my throat, then look over my shoulder at Eden. “I’ll bring some food back for you. Don’t go out on your own. Do what Lucy tells you to do.”\n Eden nods, already engrossed with the block robot again.\n Minutes later, we head out of the apartment complex and into the thickening drizzle. I keep my head down and my face hidden under the shadow of a soldier cap; my neck’s protected beneath my thick red scarf, and my hands are shoved deep into the pockets of my military coat. It’s strange how much I’ve gotten used to Republic clothing. June pulls her coat collar high, and her breath billows out around her in clouds of steam. The slush has picked up some, sending fresh ice and water into my face and tickling my eyelashes. Bold red banners still hang from the windows of most high-rises, and the JumboTrons have a red-and-black symbol in the corners of their broadcasts in honor of Anden’s birthday. Others along the street rush past in a blur of motion. We walk in comfortable silence, savoring the simple nearness of each other.\n It’s kind of weird, actually. Today’s one of my better days, and I don’t have a lot of trouble keeping up with June—today, it doesn’t feel like I only have a couple of months to live. Maybe the new medicines they gave me are going to work this time.\n We don’t say a word until June finally stops us at a small, steaming café several blocks from my apartment. Right away I can see why she chose it—it’s mostly empty, a tiny little spot on the first floor of a towering high-rise washed wet with slush, and not very well lit. Even though it’s open to the air, like many other cafés in the area, it has a few dark nooks that are nice for us to sit at, and its only lights come from glowing, cube-shaped lanterns on each of its tables. A hostess ushers us inside, seating us at June’s request in one of the shadowy corners. Flat plates of scented water sit scattered throughout the café. I shiver, even though our spot is pretty warm from our heat lantern.\n What are we doing here again? A strange fog washes over me, then clears. We’re here for dinner, that’s what we’re doing. I shake my head. I recall the brief struggle I’d had a few days ago, when I couldn’t remember Lucy’s name. A frightening thought emerges.\n Maybe this is a new symptom. Or maybe I’m just being paranoid.\n After we place our orders, June speaks up. The gold flecks in her eyes shine in the lantern’s orange glow. “Why didn’t you tell me?” she whispers.\n I hold my hands against the lantern, savoring the heat. “What good would it have done?”\n June furrows her eyebrows, and only then do I notice that her eyes look kind of swollen, like she’s been crying. She shakes her head at me. “The rumors are all over the place,” she continues in a voice I can barely hear. “Witnesses say they saw you being carried out of your apartment on a stretcher thirty-four hours ago—one of them apparently overheard a medic discussing your condition.”\n I sigh and put my hands up in defeat. “You know what, if this is all somehow causing riots in the street and more trouble for Anden, then I’m sorry. I was told to keep it a secret—and I did, as well as I could. I’m sure our glorious Elector will figure out a way to calm folks down.”\n June bites her lip once. “There must be some solution, Day. Have your doctors—”\n “They’re already trying everything.” I wince as a painful spasm runs through the back of my head, as if on cue. “I’ve been through three rounds of experiments. Slow and painful progress so far.” I explain to June what the doctors had told me, the unusual infection in my hippocampus, the medication that’s been weakening me, sucking the strength out of my body. “Believe me, they’re running through solutions.”\n “How long do you have?” she whispers.\n I stay silent, pretending to be fascinated with the lantern. I don’t know if I have the heart to say it.\n June leans closer, until her shoulder bumps softly against mine. “How long do you have?” she repeats. “Please. I hope you still care about me enough to tell me.”\n I gaze back at her, slowly falling—as I always seem to do—back under her pull. Don’t make me do this, please. I don’t want to say it out loud to her; it might mean that it’s actually true. But she looks so sad and fearful that I can’t keep it in. I let out my breath, then run a hand through my hair and lower my head. “They said a month,” I whisper. “Maybe two. They said I should get my priorities in order.”\n June closes her eyes—I think I see her sway slightly in her seat. “Two months,” she murmurs vacantly. The agony on her face reminds me exactly why I didn’t want to let her know.\n After another long silence between us, June snaps out of her daze and reaches to pull something out of her pocket. She comes back up with something small and metallic in her palm. “I’ve been meaning to give this to you,” she says.\n I stare blankly at it. It’s a paper clip ring, thin lines of wire pulled into an elegant series of swirls and closed into a circle, just like the one I’d once made for her. My eyes widen and dart up to hers. She doesn’t say anything; instead, she looks down and helps me push it onto my right hand’s ring finger. “I had a little time,” she finally mutters. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/champion-legend-3/page-13.html","bookId":1696,"book":{"id":1696,"title":"Champion (Legend #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Champion (Legend #3) \n He is a Legend. \n She is a Prodigy. \n Who will be Champion? \n June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence.
