The mayor’s still in a coma, so there’s no one here to talk to except Malcolm Crow and Val Guthrie and both of them are sitting here in my office right now. We all want to talk with you.”\n “They’re both there?”\n “Yes,” Weinstock. “Look, I know it’s a lot to ask, but if you could just meet us, let us share our concerns with you.”\n Ferro sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Saul…I just can’t see how I can manage that.”\n “What if I told you I found some of the missing cocaine?”\n “Say that again?”\n “Would you be interested if I found some of the cocaine that Ruger misplaced somewhere here in Pine Deep?”\n “Are you saying you have found some?”\n “Would it make a difference if I have? Would it get you to come back to Pine Deep? Would you be reassigned to the case?”\n “I could request it,” Ferro said cautiously. “If, and I say if, you actually had located some of the missing coke. I want to be really clear on that.”\n There was some low conversation at the other end and then a new voice spoke. “Frank? Crow here. You’re on speakerphone. Look, I don’t want to try and bullshit you with some fairy tale about finding the coke. We didn’t find any, but we did find some other stuff and we need to talk to you. I know about the whole jurisdictional thing, but trust me when I tell you that this is important. Vitally important.”\n “Crow…”\n “People are dying here, Frank.”\n “You have a police force.”\n “No,” said a third voice—Val’s. “No, Detective Ferro I don’t think we do. I think we’re all alone here and we need your help.”\n Ferro said nothing.\n “Detective Ferro…Frank,” Val said, “you told me that at my father’s funeral that if there was ever anything you could do. I know people say that because they don’t know what else to say, but I’m going to take you at your word. I’m going to make you live up to your word. You said you’d help if I needed it, and I need it. What’s your word worth?”\n “That’s pretty damned—”\n “Answer the question,” she snapped. “What is your word worth? I’ve lost my father, my brother, and my sister-in-law, and one of my best friends is in a coma. Doesn’t that give me enough of a right to ask for help?”\n Ferro felt heat bloom in his cheeks. “That’s a low blow, Ms. Guthrie.”\n “I don’t care. At this point I’d do anything to get you to come out here. Believe me when I say that.”\n “Okay,” he said. “I do believe you.”\n “Will you come?”\n He sighed in disgust. “Oh, all right, I’ll come out. But you get to play this card once and that’s it.”\n “Thank you, Frank,” she said.\n Crow said, “Can we do this tomorrow morning? Meet for lunch?”\n “Why?”\n “Because we may not have a lot of time with this. Look, Warrington’s about halfway…why don’t you meet us at Graeme Pizza? You know where that is?”\n “Across from the movie theater? On County Line Road, just off 611?”\n “Yeah. Noon okay?”\n “Not really,” Ferro said, “but we’ll be there.”\n He slammed down the phone.\n “Shit!\n 2\n “Is this all of it?” Vic said, pulling open the panel truck’s back door. It was filled with cartons floor to ceiling.\n “Everything you asked for,” said the driver. He was a weasel-faced man name Trent who owned a minority share in a candy company in Crestville. The truck was backed into an empty bay at Shanahan’s garage. Trent looked around, but there was no one else in sight.\n Vic pulled one box down and tore it open. Inside were forty one-pound bags of Pine Deep Authentic Candy Corn. He took the clipboard from Trent’s hand and scanned down the list. Fifteen boxes of candy corn; forty boxes of marshmallow Peeps—ten each of bats, pumpkins, ghosts, and black cats; twenty boxes of Gummi worms; and the rest were cartons of rolled sugar dots in Halloween colors.\n “Looks good.” He handed the clipboard back. “Okay, leave the truck here and I’ll have some of my boys offload this shit. I’ll drive you to the Black Marsh train station. You packed?”\n Trent gave a nervous bob. “By the time anyone starts tripping on these goodies I’ll be in Rio.”\n “Sounds fun. Don’t send me a postcard.”\n “No way, José. Now…just to put me at ease…you’re going to take care of everything, right? You won’t leave anything that’ll tie me to this?”\n “Yeah, I’ll handle everything.” Vic fished a cigarillo from his shirt pocket. “Got a light?”\n “Sorry, don’t smoke.”\n “No problem,” Vic said, and kicked him in the groin. Trent’s eyes goggled with surprise and sudden agony; he made a strangled squeak and dropped to his knees. Vic kicked him in the face and then stood over him and stomped him nearly to death. He smiled all the time.\n A figure stepped out from the far side of the truck. The embroidered patch on his shirt said Shanahan. “Jeez, Vic…he screw you over or something?”\n Vic turned. He was breathing heavy. “Nah…just working out some frustrations.” He nodded at what was left of Trent. “You hungry?”\n Shanahan smiled a toothy smile. “Sure,” he said, “I could eat.”\n “Help yourself. I got to head home.”\n 3\n Mike stopped home between school and his shift at the Crow’s Nest to get a sweater. The afternoon had gone suddenly cold and his light windbreaker was nowhere near warm enough. He leaned his bike against the steps, climbed onto the porch, and had just turned the handle when he heard Vic yelling. Mike froze in an attitude of listening, head cocked to one side.\n “You’re such a pain in the ass, Lois, I swear to God! All you do anymore is bitch about how hungry you are, but you won’t frigging eat anything we bring you.”\n We? Mike thought.\n He heard his mother reply, but her words were too faint to make out.\n “Well, I don’t care…and I’m not going to go get you something from Trinian’s. You think I’m the goddamn maid?”\n Trinian’s was the butcher shop in town. Mike thought it was weird that mom was asking Vic to go shopping. Vic never did anything like that. He didn’t even buy his own beer. Besides…Mike had been rooting in the fridge earlier and there was plenty of food, including pork chops and ground turkey. Why was she making a fuss about something from Trinian’s?\n “Well, you can starve for all I care.” There was a crashing sound and Mike had the feeling Vic had hurled something against the wall. He was a big one for throwing shit. “I’ll be downstairs. You know what you need to do, you silly bitch. When you come to your senses and want to feed, then send me a frigging postcard…otherwise you can kiss my white ass.”\n There was the sound of fast, stomping footsteps and then the distinctive heavy slam of the cellar door. Mike gave it a few seconds and then pushed the door open and stepped quietly into the foyer.\n Going into the living room was a major sin against Vic’s house rules, but this was driving him nuts. Every night all his mom did was sit in the living room. No lights, no TV. She seldom answered when he called to her, and sometimes she said nothing at all. It was weird and it scared Mike.\n He lingered uncertainly in the doorway.\n “Mom? Are you all right? Are you sick?”\n No answer. He took a deep breath as he stepped into the living room, standing behind the couch, not ten feet from her. The fear of Vic’s wrath was a stink in the air. “How come you always sit in the dark like this?” When she didn’t answer he said, “Look, let me turn on the light…”\n He heard her gasp. “No, Mike…please don’t…”\n “Come on, Mom, you’re freaking me out here.”\n She turned away from him just like she did the other day, clearly not wanting him to see her face, and Mike wondered just how badly had Vic beaten her that she hid her face for over a week?\n “Mom…listen to me…if you’re sick or hurt we need to get you to a doctor.”\n “Mike, if you love me, then please just leave me alone. Go to your room, go to Crow’s store…just leave me alone.”\n Mike stood there, uncertain. “I heard you tell Vic that you were hungry. You should eat something.”\n He saw her body cave over as if his words had hit her like a punch in the stomach.\n “Why don’t I go get some Chinese? I’ll get the lemon chicken you like…”\n “Go away!” she said, and this time there was an edge to her voice and and it scared Mike to hear it. It hardly sounded like her at all.\n A month ago he would have turned and fled from the sound of that voice, but he wasn’t the same boy he had been a month ago. He wasn’t even the same boy he had been that morning. Now he took a half step forward, beginning the motion of raising his hand to touch her, to reassure her, to comfort her with his presence.\n “Why, you disrespectful little shit!”\n The voice slashed through the shadows and Mike turned to see Vic’s bulk filling the doorway behind him. He hadn’t heard Vic come upstairs, hadn’t heard the cellar door open, but there he was, all puffed up with righteous rage, standing wide-legged, fists on hips like a poster of Superman.\n “Mom’s sick,” Mike said hastily.\n “Sicker than you think, shithead. Get the hell out of there.”\n But Mike held his ground. “What’s that supposed to mean?”\n “It means that she’s a sloppy drunk and a lousy lay, and if she’d just take her medicine like she’s been told she wouldn’t be mooning around the house like she was at death’s door.” Vic chuckled and repeated, “Like she was at death’s door. Ha!” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-rising-pine-deep-3/page-38.html","bookId":2569,"book":{"id":2569,"title":"Bad Moon Rising (Pine Deep #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Bad Moon Rising (Pine Deep #3) \n FROM A FUNFEST... \n Each year, the residents of Pine Deep host the Halloween Festival, drawing tourists and celebrities from across the country to enjoy the deliciously creepy fun.
