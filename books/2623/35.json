I started unbuttoning the blouse, fumbling with the funny little buttons that were too tight, and then glared balefully at myself in the mirror.\n A good-looking girl, that was for sure. I put the new clothes on in a hurry and sat down on the sofa. There was a soap on TV– I was surprised Svetlana had chosen that channel. But then, the others were probably showing much the same stuff.\n \u0027You look great,\u0027 Svetlana said on her return.\n \u0027Don\u0027t, Sveta, please,\u0027 I begged her. \u0027I feel sick enough already.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said lightly, sitting down beside me. \u0027So what have we got to do?\u0027\n \u0027We?\u0027 I asked with gentle emphasis.\n \u0027Yes, Anton. You didn\u0027t come here by chance.\u0027\n \u0027I had to tell you about the mess I\u0027m in.\u0027\n \u0027Okay. But if the boss\u0027 – Svetlana managed to pronounce the word \u0027boss\u0027 with respect and irony at the same time – \u0027has allowed you to confide in me, that means I have to help you. It must be the will of destiny.\u0027 She couldn\u0027t resist that.\n I gave in.\n \u0027I mustn\u0027t be left alone. Not for a moment. The basis of the whole plan is that the Dark Ones are deliberately sacrificing their own pawns – either killing them or allowing them to die.\u0027\n \u0027Like the other time?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Precisely. And if this provocation is directed at me, there\u0027s going to be another killing any time now. At some moment when they think I don\u0027t have an alibi.\u0027\n Svetlana looked at me with her chin propped on her hands and slowly shook her head.\n \u0027And then you\u0027ll jump out of this body like a jack out of his box. And it\u0027ll be clear that you couldn\u0027t have carried out these serial killings. The enemy is confounded.\u0027\n \u0027Uhuh.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I haven\u0027t been in the Watch for long, maybe there\u0027s something I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\n That put me on my guard. Svetlana hesitated for a second and then went on:\n \u0027When all those things happened to me, what was going on? The Dark Ones were hoping to initiate me. They knew the Night Watch would notice, they even figured out that you could possibly get involved and help.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027That was why they played out that complex plan, sacrificing a few pieces and building up false positions of strength. And to begin with, the Night Watch was taken in. If the boss hadn\u0027t launched his counter-plan, if you hadn\u0027t gone charging straight in, taking no notice of anything . . .\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d be my enemy now,\u0027 I said. \u0027You\u0027d be studying with the Day Watch.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not what I meant, Anton. I\u0027m grateful to you, and to everyone in the Night Watch, but above all to you. But that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about right now. Surely you understand that what you\u0027ve just told me sounds about as probable as that story did? Everything fitted together so neatly, didn\u0027t it? A pair of vampires poaching. A boy with exceptional powers. A girl under a powerful curse. A massive threat to the entire city.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t know what to say. I looked at her and felt my cheeks beginning to burn. A girl who wasn\u0027t a third of the way through the introductory course, a total novice in our line of work, was laying out the situation for me the way I ought to have laid it out for myself.\n \u0027What\u0027s happening right now?\u0027 Svetlana continued, not noticing the torment I was in. \u0027There\u0027s a serial killer destroying Dark Ones. You\u0027re on the list of suspects. The boss immediately makes a cunning move: you and Olga swap bodies. But just how cunning is this move, really? As far as I understand it, the practice of body-swapping is quite common. Boris Ignatievich himself used it only recently, didn\u0027t he? Has he ever used the same move twice in a row? Against the same enemy?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, Svetlana, they don\u0027t tell me all the details of the operations.\u0027\n \u0027Then think for yourself. And another thing. Is Zabulon really so petty, so hysterically vengeful? He\u0027s hundreds of years old, isn\u0027t he? He\u0027s been in charge of the Day Watch for a very, very long time. If this maniac—\u0027\n \u0027Maverick.\u0027\n \u0027If they really have let this Maverick run loose on the streets of Moscow while they get ready to make their move, then would the head of the Day Watch really waste him on something that trivial? I\u0027m sorry, Anton, but you\u0027re really not such an important target.\u0027\n \u0027I understand. Officially I\u0027m a fifth-grade magician, but the boss said I could aim for third-grade.\u0027\n \u0027Even taking that into account.\u0027\n We looked into each other\u0027s eyes and I shrugged:\n \u0027I give up, Svetlana, you must be right. But I\u0027ve told you all I know. And I can\u0027t see any other possible interpretation.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027re just going to follow instructions? Walk around in a skirt, never let yourself be alone for a single moment?\u0027\n \u0027When I joined the Watch, I knew I was giving up part of my freedom.\u0027\n \u0027Part of it!\u0027 Svetlana snorted. \u0027Is that what you call it? Okay, you know best. So we\u0027re spending the night together, then?\u0027\n I nodded:\n \u0027Yes . . . But not here. It\u0027s best if I stay with people all the time.\u0027\n \u0027What about sleeping?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not that hard to go without sleep for a few nights,\u0027 I said with a shrug. \u0027I expect Olga\u0027s body is trained at least as well as mine. This last few months her life\u0027s been one never-ending high-society whirl.\u0027\n \u0027Anton, I haven\u0027t learned these tricks yet. When do I sleep?\u0027\n \u0027During the day. In class.\u0027\n She frowned. I knew Svetlana would agree, she couldn\u0027t help herself. With her character she couldn\u0027t even refuse to help some stranger in the street, and I certainly wasn\u0027t that.\n \u0027Why don\u0027t we go to the Maharajah?\u0027 I suggested.\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027An Indian restaurant, it\u0027s pretty good.\u0027\n \u0027Is it open all night?\u0027\n \u0027No, unfortunately. But we\u0027ll think of somewhere else to go on to afterwards.\u0027\n Svetlana stared at me so long she got under even my naturally thick skin. What had I done wrong this time?\n \u0027Thank you, Anton,\u0027 she said with real feeling. \u0027Thank you very much. You\u0027ve just invited me to a restaurant. I\u0027ve been waiting two months for that.\u0027\n She got up, went across to the wardrobe, opened it and gazed thoughtfully at the clothes hanging there.\n \u0027I don\u0027t have anything decent in your size,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027ll have to get back into the jeans. Will they let you into the restaurant?\u0027\n \u0027They should,\u0027 I said, not too sure of myself. But if it came to that, I could always influence the restaurant staff a little.\n \u0027If need be, I can practise implanting suggestions,\u0027 Svetlana said, as if she\u0027d read my thoughts. \u0027I\u0027ll make them let you in. That will be a good deed, won\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027You know, Anton . . .\u0027 she said, taking a dress off a hanger, holding it up against herself and shaking her head. Then she took out a beige suit. \u0027. . . I\u0027m amazed at the way the members of the Watch use the interests of the Good and the Light to justify any interference in reality.\u0027\n \u0027Not any interference!\u0027 I protested.\n \u0027Absolutely any. If necessary, they\u0027ll even claim robbery\u0027s a good deed, even murder.\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Imagine you\u0027re walking along the street and you see a grown-up beating a child, right there in front of you. What would you do?\u0027\n \u0027If I had any margin left for intervention,\u0027 I said with a shrug, \u0027I\u0027d perform a remoralisation. Naturally.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027d be absolutely certain that was the right thing to do? Without even thinking it over, without looking into things? What if the child deserved to be punished for what it had done? What if the punishment would have saved it from serious problems later in life, but now it will grow up to be a murderer and a bandit? You and your remoralisation!\u0027\n \u0027Sveta, you don\u0027t understand.\u0027\n \u0027What don\u0027t I understand?\u0027\n \u0027Even if I didn\u0027t have, any margin left for parapsychological influence, I still wouldn\u0027t just walk on by.\u0027\n Svetlana snorted.\n \u0027And you\u0027d be certain you were right? Where\u0027s the boundary?\u0027\n \u0027Everyone determines that for themselves. It comes with experience.\u0027\n She looked at me thoughtfully.\n \u0027Anton, every novice asks these questions. I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 I smiled.\n \u0027And you\u0027re used to answering them, you have a series of ready-made answers, sophisms, historical examples and parallels.\u0027\n \u0027No, Sveta. That\u0027s not the point. The point is that the Dark Ones never ask questions like these.\u0027\n \u0027How do you know?\u0027\n \u0027A Dark Magician can heal, a Light Magician can kill,\u0027 I said. \u0027That\u0027s the truth. Do you know what the difference is between Light and Dark?\u0027\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t. For some reason, they don\u0027t teach us that. I expect it\u0027s hard to formulate clearly.\u0027\n \u0027Not at all. If you always put yourself and your own interests first, then your path leads through the Dark. If you think about others, it leads towards the Light.\u0027\n \u0027And how long will it take to reach it? The Light, I mean.\u0027\n \u0027For ever.\u0027\n \u0027This is all empty words, Anton. A word game. What does an experienced Dark Magician tell his novice? Maybe he uses words that are just as beautiful and true.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. About freedom. About how everyone gets the place in life that they deserve. About how pity is degrading and true love is blind, and true kindness is useless – and true freedom is freedom from everyone else.\u0027\n \u0027And is that a lie?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said with a nod. \u0027That\u0027s a part of the truth too. Sveta, we\u0027re not given the chance to choose absolute truth. Truth\u0027s always two-faced. The only thing we have is the right to reject the he we find most repugnant. Do you know what I tell novices about to enter the Twilight for the first time? We enter it in order to acquire strength. And as the price for entering it we give up the part of the truth that we don\u0027t want to accept. Ordinary humans have it easier. A million times easier, even with all the disasters and problems and worries that don\u0027t exist for the Others. Humans have never had to face this choice: they can be good and bad, it all depends on the moment, on their surroundings, on the book they read yesterday, on the steak they had for dinner. That\u0027s why they\u0027re so easy to influence, even the most malicious person can easily be turned to the Light, and the kindest and most noble of men can be nudged towards the Dark. But we have made a choice.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve made it too, Anton. I\u0027ve already been in the Twilight.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Then why don\u0027t I understand where the boundary is and what the difference is between me and some witch who attends black masses? Why am I still asking these questions?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll never stop asking them. Out loud at first, and later on just to yourself. It will never stop, never. If you wanted to be free of painful questions, you chose the wrong side.\u0027\n \u0027I chose the one I wanted.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-35.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
