So we\u0027re not dealing with a case of forgetfulness here. Have you activated the amulet?\u0027 I asked.\n The werewolf gave the vampire a sideways glance and then looked away.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027I see. Failure to carry out duty instructions. As the senior member of the duty detail, you will be penalised. You will inform the duty officer.\u0027\n The werewolf said nothing.\n \u0027Repeat what I said, security guard.\u0027\n He realised it was stupid to defy me and repeated my words.\n \u0027And now get back to serving your watch,\u0027 I said and walked to the left, still carrying the sleeping mouse on my open palm.\n \u0027Bon appétit,\u0027 the werewolf muttered after me. Those creatures have no discipline – the animal half of them is just too strong.\n \u0027I hope that in a real battle you would be at least half as brave as this little mouse,\u0027 I replied as I got into the lift. I caught Kostya\u0027s eye – and it seemed to me that the young vampire was embarrassed, and even glad that the cruel amusement was over.\n My appearance in the department with a mouse in my hand caused an uproar.\n Anna Lemesheva, the senior witch on our shift, was about to launch into her usual tirade about young people who haven\u0027t been taught any discipline – \u0027Under Stalin for being five minutes late you\u0027d have been packed off to a camp in Kolyma to brew potions\u0027 – when she saw the mouse and was struck dumb. Lenka Kireeva squealed and then howled: \u0027Oh, how lovely\u0027. Zhanna Gromova giggled and asked if I was going to make the \u0027thief\u0027s elixir\u0027, which has a boiled mouse as an essential ingredient, and what I was planning to steal afterwards. Olya Melnikova finished painting her nails and congratulated me on a successful hunt.\n I put the little creature down on my desk as if I never came to work without a fresh mouse and told everyone how the security guards had been amusing themselves.\n Anna shook her head:\n \u0027Is that why you were late?\u0027\n \u0027Partly,\u0027 I said honestly. \u0027Anna Tikhonovna, I was incredibly unlucky with the traffic. And then there were those nitwits playing their games.\u0027\n Anna Lemesheva is an old and experienced witch; it\u0027s pointless trying to deceive her by putting on a brave front. She\u0027s about a hundred years old, and after all the things she\u0027d seen, the game with the mouse was hardly going to seem cruel. But even so she pursed her lips and declared:\n \u0027These werewolves have no respect for the idea of duty. When we were stationed at Revel, fighting the Swedes, we had a saying: \"If they send the Watch a werewolf, detail a witch to watch him.\" What would have happened if an assault group of Light Ones had burst in while both guards were gawping at that rodent? They could have sent the mouse in deliberately. It\u0027s disgraceful. I think you should have demanded more serious punishment, Alisa.\u0027\n \u0027The lash,\u0027 Lenka Kireeva said in a quiet voice. She flicked her head of long red hair. Oh, that hair of Lenka\u0027s, anyone would envy it. But the comforting thing is that none of the rest of her is up to the same standard.\n \u0027Yes, it was a mistake to end the practice of punishment with the lash,\u0027 Anna replied coldly. \u0027Throw that creature out of the window, Alisa.\u0027\n \u0027I feel sorry for it,\u0027 I objected. \u0027It\u0027s blockheads like those two who are responsible for the image of Dark Ones that exists in the mass consciousness, a caricature of vicious sadists and monsters . . . Why torment the poor mouse?\u0027\n \u0027It does create a certain discharge of energy,\u0027 said Olya, screwing the lid onto her nail varnish. \u0027But it\u0027s very i-ny . . .\u0027\n She shook her hands in the air.\n Zhanna snorted derisively.\n \u0027A discharge! They used up so much energy creating the illusory cat, they\u0027d have to torture a kilo of mice to make up for it.\u0027\n \u0027We could work it out,\u0027 Olya suggested. \u0027We torture this mouse to death and measure the total power emitted . . . only we\u0027d need a pair of scales as well.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re terrible,\u0027 Lena said angrily. \u0027And you\u0027re quite right, Alisa! Can I take the mouse?\u0027\n \u0027What for?\u0027 I asked jealously.\n \u0027To give to my daughter. She\u0027s six, it\u0027s time she had something to care for and look after. That\u0027s good for a girl.\u0027\n There was an awkward silence. Of course, it\u0027s not so unusual. It\u0027s rare for an Other to have a child who is also an Other . . . Very rare. It\u0027s simpler for vampires – they can initiate their own child, and it\u0027s simpler for shape-shifters – their children almost always inherit the ability to change form. But the chances are not so good for us, or for the Light Ones either. Lena hadn\u0027t been lucky, even though her husband was a Dark Magician and a former staff member of the Day Watch, who had retired after he was wounded and become a businessman.\n \u0027Mice don\u0027t live very long,\u0027 Olya observed. \u0027There\u0027ll be tears and tantrums.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s all right, it\u0027ll live a long time with me,\u0027 Lena laughed. \u0027Ten years at least. Pavel and I will make sure of that.\u0027\n \u0027Then take it!\u0027 I said, indicating the mouse with a magnanimous gesture. \u0027I\u0027ll come round to visit some time.\u0027\n \u0027Did you put it into a deep sleep?\u0027 Lena asked, picking the mouse up by the tail.\n \u0027It will sleep until the evening for sure.\u0027\n \u0027Good.\u0027\n She carried the mouse to her desk, shook the floppy disks out of a cardboard box and put the little creature in it.\n \u0027Buy a cage,\u0027 Olga advised as she admired her nails. \u0027Or an aquarium. If it escapes it will gnaw everything to pieces and leave filthy droppings everywhere.\u0027\n Anna Lemesheva had followed the conversation thoughtfully and then clapped her hands.\n \u0027All right, girls. That\u0027s enough distraction. The unfortunate creature has been saved and it has found a new home. Things could hardly have been resolved more elegantly. Now let\u0027s begin our briefing.\u0027\n She\u0027s a very strict boss, but not malicious. She doesn\u0027t make things hard for anyone for no reason, and she\u0027ll let you fool about, or leave early if necessary. But when it comes to work, it\u0027s best not to argue with her.\n The girls all sat in their places. Our room is small; after all, the building wasn\u0027t meant for the present numbers of the Watch. All that could fit were four small tables for us and one big desk, where Anna Lemesheva sat. The room reminded me of a school class- room in some tiny village somewhere, with a class of four pupils and one teacher.\n Lemesheva waited until we\u0027d all switched on our computers and accessed the network; then she began in her resonant voice:\n \u0027Today\u0027s assignment is the usual: patrolling the south-east region of Moscow. You will choose your partners in the guardroom from among the available operatives.\u0027\n We always go on duty in pairs, usually one witch and one shape-shifter or vampire. If the level of patrols is stepped up, then instead of ordinary operatives they give us warlocks or some of the junior magicians as partners. But that doesn\u0027t happen very often.\n \u0027Lenochka, you\u0027re patrolling Vykhino and Liublino.\u0027\n Lena Kireeva, who had stealthily begun playing patience on her computer, started and prepared to argue. I could understand why. Two huge districts and a long way away too. Nothing would come of it, of course. Anna Lemesheva would insist on having her own way as always, but Kireeva couldn\u0027t help feeling indignant.\n But just at that moment the phone on Lemesheva\u0027s desk rang. We exchanged glances, and even Lena\u0027s eyes became serious. It was the direct line from the operations duty officer, it didn\u0027t just ring for nothing.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Lemesheva. \u0027Yes. Of course. I understand. I accept the detail.\u0027\n For a moment her expression became vague – the duty magician was sending her a telepathic briefing on the situation.\n That meant it was serious, that there was work to do.\n \u0027To your brooms . . .\u0027 Lenka whispered quietly. The line, from a children\u0027s cartoon, was a traditional saying with us. \u0027I wonder who they\u0027ll send,\u0027 she said.\n But when Anna Lemesheva put the receiver down, her expression was firm and tough.\n \u0027Into the bus, girls. Everyone. Look lively.\u0027\n So much for \u0027to your brooms\u0027.\n This meant something very serious. This meant a fight. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-76.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
