{"id":101338,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"I sighed and set off towards the building\u0027s entrance. The trunk of the vortex swayed as it tried to touch me. I stretched my hands out, folding them into the Xamadi, the sign of negation.\n The vortex shuddered and recoiled. Not really afraid, just playing by the rules. At that size the advancing Inferno should already have developed powers of reason, stopped being a mindless, target-seeking missile and become a ferocious, experienced kamikaze. I know that sounds odd – an experienced kamikaze – but when it comes to the Dark, the term\u0027s justified. Once it breaks through into the human world, an Inferno vortex is doomed, but it\u0027s only a single wasp out of a huge swarm that dies.\n \u0027Your hour hasn\u0027t come yet,\u0027 I said. The Inferno wasn\u0027t about to answer me, but I felt like saying it anyway.\n I walked past the stalk. The vortex looked like it was made of blue-black glass that had acquired the flexibility of rubber. Its outer surface was almost motionless, but deep inside, where the dark blue became impenetrable darkness, I could vaguely see a furious spinning motion.\n Maybe I was wrong. Maybe its hour had come . . .\n The entrance didn\u0027t even have a coded entry system. Or rather, it had one, but it had been smashed and gutted. That was normal. A little greeting from the Dark. I\u0027d already stopped paying any attention to its tracks, even stopped noticing the words and the dirty paw marks on walls, the broken lamps and the fouled lifts. But now I was wound up tight.\n I needn\u0027t have asked for the number. I could sense the girl – I kept on thinking about her as a girl, even though she\u0027d been married – I knew which way to go, I could even see her apartment, or rather, not see it, but perceive it as a whole.\n The only thing I didn\u0027t understand was how I was going to get rid of that damned twister.\n I stopped in front of the door. It was an ordinary one, not metal, very unusual on a first floor, especially in a building where the entrance lock is broken. I gave a deep sigh and rang the bell. Eleven o\u0027clock. A bit late, of course.\n I heard steps. There was no sound insulation . . .\n CHAPTER 7\n SHE OPENED the door straight away.\n She didn\u0027t ask who it was, she didn\u0027t look through the spy-hole, she didn\u0027t put on the chain. In Moscow! And at night! Alone in her apartment! The vortex was devouring the final remnants of the girl\u0027s caution, the caution that had kept her alive for several days. That was usually the way people died when they had been cursed . . .\n But to look at, Svetlana still seemed normal. Except maybe for the shadows under her eyes, but who knew what kind of a night she\u0027d had? And the way she was dressed – a skirt, a smart blouse, shoes – as if she was expecting someone or was all set to go out.\n \u0027Good evening, Svetlana,\u0027 I said, already noticing a faint gleam of recognition in her eyes. Of course, she had a vague memory of me from the previous day. And I had to exploit that moment when she\u0027d already realised we knew each other but still hadn\u0027t remembered from where.\n I reached out through the Twilight. Cautiously, because the vortex was hanging right there above the girl\u0027s head as if it was attached to her, and it could react at any second. Cautiously, because I didn\u0027t really want to deceive her.\n Not even if it were for her own good.\n It\u0027s only the first time that\u0027s interesting and funny. If you still find it amusing after that, the Night Watch is the wrong place for you. It\u0027s one thing to shift someone\u0027s moral imperatives, especially when it\u0027s always towards the Good. It\u0027s quite another to interfere with their memory. It\u0027s inevitable, it has to be done, it\u0027s part of the Treaty, and through the very process of entering and leaving the Twilight we induce a momentary amnesia in the people around us.\n But if you ever start to enjoy toying with someone else\u0027s memory – it\u0027s time you quit the Watch.\n \u0027Good evening, Anton.\u0027 Her voice blurred slightly when I forced her to remember things that had never happened. \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027\n I smiled sourly and slapped myself on the stomach. By now there was a hurricane raging in Svetlana\u0027s memory. My control wasn\u0027t so great that I could implant a fully structured false memory in her mind. Fortunately, in this case, I could just give her a couple of hints, and from then on she deceived herself. She put my image together out of one old acquaintance I happened to resemble and another person she\u0027d known and liked even earlier than that, but not for long, as well as a couple of dozen patients my age and some of her neighbours in the building. I only gave the process a gentle nudge, helping Svetlana towards an integrated image. A good man ... a neurasthenic . . . quite often unwell. . . flirts a bit, but no more than a bit – very unsure of himself. . . lives on the next stairwell.\n \u0027Are you in pain?\u0027 She gathered her thoughts. She really was a good doctor. With a genuine vocation.\n \u0027A bit. I had a drink yesterday,\u0027 I said, trying to look repentant.\n \u0027Anton, I warned you . . . come in . . .\u0027\n I went in and closed the door – the girl hadn\u0027t even bothered to do it. While I was taking off my coat, I had a quick look round, in the ordinary world and in the Twilight.\n Cheap wallpaper, a tattered rug on the floor, an old pair of boots, a light bulb in a simple glass shade on the ceiling, a radio telephone on the wall – cheap Chinese junk. Modest. Clean. Ordinary. And the important thing here wasn\u0027t that the profession of district doctor doesn\u0027t pay very well. It was more that she didn\u0027t feel any need for comfort. That was bad . . . very bad.\n In the Twilight world the apartment made a slightly better impression. No repulsive plant life, no trace of the Dark. Apart from the black vortex, of course, just hanging there ... I could see the entire thing, from the stalk, swirling round above the girl\u0027s head, up to the broad mouth, thirty metres higher.\n I followed Svetlana through into the only room. At least things were a bit more cosy in here. The sofa had a warm orange glow – not all of it, though, just the part by the old-fashioned standard lamp. Two walls were covered with single-box bookshelves stacked on top of each other, seven shelves high.\n I was beginning to understand her, not just as a professional target and a potential victim of a Dark Magician, not just as the unwitting cause of a catastrophe, but as a person. An introverted, bookish child, with a mass of complexes and her head full of crazy ideals and a childish faith in the beautiful prince who was searching for her and would surely find her. Work as a doctor, a few girlfriends, a few male friends and lots and lots of loneliness. Conscientious work almost in the spirit of a builder of communism, infrequent visits to the cafe and occasional loves. And each evening like every other one, on the sofa, with a book, with the phone lying beside her, with the television muttering something soapy and comforting.\n How many of you there still are, girls and boys of various ages, raised by naïve parents in the seventies. How many of you there are, so unhappy, not knowing how to be happy. How I long to take pity on you, how I long to help you. To touch you through the Twilight – gently, with no force at all. To give you just a little confidence in yourself, just a bit of optimism, a gram of willpower, a crumb of irony. To help you, so that you can help others.\n But I can\u0027t.\n Every action taken by Good grants permission for an active response by Evil. The Treaty! The Watches! The balance of peace in the world?\n I have to live with it or go crazy, break the law, walk through the crowd handing out unsolicited gifts, changing destinies, wondering which corner I\u0027ll turn and find my old friends and eternal enemies, waiting to dispatch me into the Twilight. For ever . . .\n \u0027Anton, how\u0027s your mother?\u0027\n Ah, yes. As Anton Gorodetsky, the patient, I had an old mother. She had osteochondrosis and a full set of old folks\u0027 ailments. She was Svetlana\u0027s patient too.\n \u0027Not too bad, she\u0027s okay. I\u0027m the one who\u0027s—\u0027\n \u0027Lie down.\u0027\n I pulled off my shirt and sweater and lay down on the sofa. Svetlana squatted down beside me. She ran her warm fingers over my stomach and even palpated my liver.\n \u0027Does that hurt?\u0027\n \u0027No . . . not now.\u0027\n \u0027How much did you drink?\u0027\n As I replied to the doctor\u0027s questions, I looked for the answers in her mind. No need to make it look like I was dying. Yes... I had dull pains, not too sharp . . . After food ... I\u0027d just had a little twinge. . .\n \u0027So far it\u0027s just gastritis, Anton,\u0027 said Svetlana, taking her hands away. \u0027But that\u0027s bad enough, you know that. I\u0027ll write you a prescription.\u0027\n She got up, walked to the door and took her handbag off the peg.\n All this time I was observing the vortex. There was nothing happening, my arrival hadn\u0027t triggered any intensification in the Inferno, but it hadn\u0027t done anything to weaken it either.\n \u0027Anton . . .\u0027 I recognised the voice coming through the Twilight as Olga\u0027s. \u0027Anton, the vortex has lost three centimetres of height. You must have made a right move somewhere. Think, Anton.\u0027\n A right move? When? I hadn\u0027t done anything except invent a reason to visit.\n \u0027Anton, do you have any of your ulcer medicine left?\u0027 Svetlana asked, looking across at me from the table. I nodded as I tucked in my shirt.\n \u0027Yes, a few capsules.\u0027\n \u0027When you get home, take one. And buy some more tomorrow. Then take them for two weeks, before you go to bed.\u0027\n Svetlana was obviously one of those doctors who believe in pills. That didn\u0027t bother me, I believed in them too. All of us – the Others, that is – have an irrational awe of science; even in cases when elementary magical influence would do the job, we reach for the painkillers and antibiotics.\n \u0027Svetlana, I hope you don\u0027t mind me asking,\u0027 I said, looking away guiltily. \u0027Have you got problems of some kind?\u0027\n \u0027Where did you get that idea, Anton?\u0027 she asked, carrying on writing and not even glancing in my direction. But she tensed.\n \u0027Just a feeling. Has someone offended you somehow?\u0027\n She put down her pen and looked at me with curiosity and gentle sympathy in her eyes.\n \u0027No, Anton. There\u0027s nothing. I expect it\u0027s just the winter. The winter\u0027s too long.\u0027\n She gave a forced smile and the Inferno vortex swayed above her head, shifting its stalk greedily.\n \u0027The sky\u0027s grey, the world\u0027s grey. And I don\u0027t feel like doing anything . . . everything seems meaningless. I\u0027m tired, Anton. It\u0027ll pass when spring comes.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re depressed, Svetlana,\u0027 I blurted out before I realised that I\u0027d drawn the diagnosis out of her own memory. But she didn\u0027t pay any attention.\n \u0027Probably. Never mind, when the sun comes out. . . Thanks for your concern, Anton.\u0027\n This time her smile was more genuine, but it was still pained.\n I heard Olga\u0027s voice whispering through the Twilight:\n \u0027Anton, it\u0027s down ten centimetres. The vortex is losing height. The analysts are working on it, Anton. Keep talking to her.\u0027\n What was I doing right?\u0027\n That question was more terrifying than \u0027What am I doing wrong?\u0027 Make a mistake, and all you have to do is make a sharp change of approach. But if you\u0027ve hit the target without knowing how you did it, then you\u0027re in a real bind. It\u0027s tough being a bad shot who\u0027s hit the bull\u0027s eye by chance, struggling to remember how you moved your hands and screwed up your eyes, how much pressure your finger applied to the trigger . . . and not wanting to believe that the bullet was directed to the target by a random gust of wind.\n I caught myself sitting and looking at Svetlana. And she was looking at me. Seriously, without speaking.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Svetlana, forgive me. I came barging in late in the evening, and now I\u0027m interfering in your private life . . .\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s all right, Anton. Actually, I like it. Now, would you like some tea?\"\n \u0027Down twenty centimetres, Anton! Say yes!\u0027\n Even those few centimetres skimmed off the height of the vortex were a gift from the gods. They were human lives. Tens or even hundreds of lives snatched away from the inevitable catastrophe. I didn\u0027t know how I was doing it, but I was increasing Svetlana\u0027s resistance to the Inferno. And the vortex was beginning to melt away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-20.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
