What we have here is the work of a Light Magician who is not registered in Moscow and is unaware of the Treaty.\u0027 Now that was serious . . . \u0027Then . . . oh!\u0027 said Yulia. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Boris Ignatievich.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s okay,\u0027 the boss said, nodding again. \u0027It\u0027s taken us right to the heart of the matter. There\u0027s someone we\u0027ve managed to miss, everyone. We\u0027ve let him slip through our fingers. We have a Light One of great power wandering loose in Moscow. He doesn\u0027t know the situation here – and he\u0027s killing Dark Ones.\u0027 \u0027More than one?\u0027 a voice asked. \u0027Yes. I checked the archives. There were similar incidents three years ago, in the spring and autumn, and two years ago, in the autumn again. On each occasion there was no physical trauma, but the victims\u0027 clothes were slashed. The Day Watch investigated, but came up with nothing. Apparently they put the deaths down to some random accident ... so now one of the Dark Ones will be punished for it.\u0027 \u0027And one of the Light Ones too?\u0027 \u0027One of us too.\u0027 Semyon cleared his throat and said softly: \u0027The gaps between the incidents are strange, Boris . . .\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think we know about all of them. Whoever this magician is, he has always killed Others with low-level powers, obviously there must have been some kind of weakness in their protection. It\u0027s very likely that a number of his victims were uninitiated or unknown Dark Others. Here\u0027s what I propose . . .\u0027 The boss paused and glanced round the room before continuing: \u0027Analytical section – collate all available information from criminal records and try to identify similar incidents. Bear in mind that they may not have been classified as murder, more likely as deaths from unknown causes. Look into the results of autopsies, question the morgue staff. . . think for yourselves where you can get relevant information. Research group – send two or three agents to the Day Watch and request an examination of the body. Operations group – intensive street patrols. Try to find him, OK?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re always on the lookout for someone,\u0027 Igor muttered. \u0027Boris Ignatievich, there\u0027s no way we could have overlooked a powerful magician. We just couldn\u0027t have!\u0027 \u0027He may not be initiated,\u0027 the boss snapped back. \u0027His powers manifest themselves sporadically . . .\u0027 \u0027In the spring and the autumn, just like any ordinary psycho . . .\u0027 \u0027Yes, Igor, that\u0027s exactly it. In the spring and in the autumn. And now, right after this latest killing, he must still be showing some trace of magic. That gives us a chance, if only a small one. Get on to it.\u0027 \u0027Boris, what exactly is our goal?\u0027 Semyon asked curiously. Some of the agents had already started getting to their feet, but now they paused. \u0027Our goal is to find this Maverick before the Dark Ones do. To protect him, educate him and bring him over to our side. As usual.\u0027 \u0027Clear enough,\u0027 said Semyon and stood up. \u0027Anton and Olga, would you please remain?\u0027 the boss said brusquely and walked over to the window. On their way out, agents glanced at us curiously, even enviously. A special assignment is always intriguing. I looked across the room, caught Olga\u0027s eye and smiled with just my mouth. She smiled back. She looked nothing like the dirty-faced, barefoot young woman who\u0027d drunk cognac with me in my kitchen in the middle of the winter. Now her hair was expensively cut, her complexion healthy and her eyes full of. . . no, the confidence had been there all the time, but now there was a certain flirtatious pride too. Her sentence had been repealed. In part, at least. \u0027Anton, I don\u0027t like what\u0027s going on here,\u0027 the boss said without turning round. Olga shrugged her shoulders and nodded for me to reply. \u0027I beg your pardon, Boris Ignatievich?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t like this protest lodged by the Day Watch.\u0027 \u0027Neither do I.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t understand, and I\u0027m afraid none of the others do either . .. Olga, have you at least some inkling of what\u0027s going on?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s very strange the Day Watch haven\u0027t been able to find the killer after all this time.\u0027 \u0027Yes. Do you remember Krakow?\u0027 \u0027I do, unfortunately. You think we\u0027re being set up?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s possible . . .\u0027 The boss moved away from the window. \u0027Anton, do you think that could be it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t entirely understand,\u0027 I mumbled. \u0027Anton, let\u0027s assume that we really do have a Maverick wandering round the city, a solitary killer. He\u0027s uninitiated. From time to time his powers suddenly surface ... he locates one of the Dark Ones and eliminates them. Wouldn\u0027t the Day Watch be able to find him? Unfortunately, believe me, they would. So the question is: why haven\u0027t they caught him and exposed him, when Dark Ones are dying?\u0027 \u0027Only insignificant ones?\u0027 I suggested. \u0027True. Sacrificing pawns is in the tradition . . .\u0027 the boss caught my eye and paused, \u0027. . . in the tradition of the Watch.\u0027 \u0027The Watches,\u0027 I said sharply. \u0027The Watches,\u0027 the boss echoed wearily. \u0027You haven\u0027t forgotten . . . Let\u0027s think where a manoeuvre like this could be leading. An accusation of incompetence against the whole of the Night Watch? No. We\u0027re supposed to keep tabs on the activities of the Dark Ones and the observance of the Treaty by known Light Ones, not go hunting for mysterious psychos. In this case it\u0027s the Day Watch who is in the wrong.\u0027 \u0027Which means it must be a provocation aimed at someone in particular?\u0027 \u0027Exactly, Anton. Remember what Yulia said? There\u0027s only a small handful of us who could have done this. That can be proved conclusively. Let\u0027s suppose the Day Watch has decided to accuse someone of violating the Treaty. To claim that one of us – someone who knows the terms of the Treaty – is meting out summary justice on his own account.\u0027 \u0027But that\u0027s easy to disprove. Just find the Maverick . . .\u0027 \u0027And if the Dark Ones find him first, but don\u0027t bother to announce the fact?\u0027 \u0027What about alibis?\u0027 \u0027And what if the killings took place at times when someone has no alibi?\u0027 \u0027A tribunal, with a full-scale interrogation,\u0027 I said sombrely – having your mind turned inside out isn\u0027t a pleasant experience . . . \u0027A powerful magician – and these killings were committed by a powerful magician – can close off his mind even against a tribunal. Not deceive the tribunal, just close himself off from it. In any case, Anton, with a tribunal that included Dark Ones, he would have to. Otherwise our enemies would learn far too much about us. And if a magician conceals himself against investigation, it\u0027s automatically regarded as a confession of guilt. With all the consequences that would follow from such a confession – both for him and for the Watch.\u0027 \u0027You paint a dark picture, Boris Ignatievich,\u0027 I said. \u0027Very dark. Almost as dark as the one you painted for me last winter, when you briefed me in my sleep. A young boy with extraordinary Other powers, an Inferno eruption that would flatten the whole of Moscow . . .\u0027 \u0027I understand. But I\u0027m not lying to you, Anton.\u0027 \u0027What do you expect from me?\u0027 I asked bluntly. \u0027This isn\u0027t really my field. Am I going to give the analysts a hand? We\u0027ll be handling everything they bring in anyway.\u0027 \u0027Anton, I want you to work out which one of us is under threat. Who has an alibi for all the known incidents and who doesn\u0027t.\u0027 The boss slipped his hand into his jacket pocket and took out a disk. \u0027Take this . . . it\u0027s a complete record for the entire three-year period. For four of us, including me.\u0027 I swallowed hard as I took it. \u0027The security codes have been removed. But you understand that no one else must see this. You have no right to copy the information. Encrypt all your calculations and procedures . . . and make the key as complex as you can.\u0027 \u0027I could really do with some help,\u0027 I suggested hesitantly, with a glance at Olga. But then, what kind of help could she give me? Everything she knew about computers, she\u0027d learned from playing games like Heretic and Hexen. \u0027You can check my database yourself,\u0027 the boss said, after a pause. \u0027Use Tolik for the others. All right?\u0027 \u0027Then what\u0027s my assignment?\u0027 asked Olga. \u0027You\u0027ll cover the same ground, only by asking direct questions. Interrogating people, not to put too fine a point on it. And you\u0027ll start with me. Then the other three.\u0027 \u0027All right, Boris.\u0027 \u0027Get on to it, Anton,\u0027 the boss said with a nod. \u0027Start immediately. You can pass everything else on to your staff, they\u0027ll cope.\u0027 \u0027Maybe I could fiddle about a bit with the data?\u0027 I asked. \u0027If someone doesn\u0027t happen to have an alibi, I could arrange one.\u0027 The boss shook his head. \u0027No. You don\u0027t understand. I don\u0027t want to set up any false alibis. I want to be absolutely sure that none of us is involved in these killings.\u0027 \u0027Are you serious?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Because nothing\u0027s impossible in this world. Anton, the good thing about our work is that I can give you an assignment like this. And you\u0027ll carry it out. Regardless of who\u0027s involved.\u0027 There was still something bothering me, but I nodded and walked towards the door, clutching the disk. My question only took shape as I was leaving. I turned back and asked: \u0027Boris Ignatievich . . .\u0027 The boss and Olga instantly moved apart. \u0027Boris Ignatievich, you say there are four sets of data here?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027For you, Ilya, Semyon . . .\u0027 \u0027And you, Anton.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 I asked dumbly. \u0027During that stand-off on the roof you stayed down in the second level of the Twilight for three minutes, Anton . . . that\u0027s a third-grade power.\u0027 \u0027Impossible,\u0027 I said. \u0027It happened.\u0027 \u0027Boris Ignatievich, you always told me I was just an average magician!\u0027 \u0027Well, let\u0027s just say I need an excellent programmer more than one more field operative.\u0027 At any other moment I would have felt proud. Offended at the same time, of course, but still proud. I\u0027d always thought that fourth-grade magic was my ceiling, and it would be a long time before I reached it. But just at that moment everything was clouded by a clammy, repellent feeling – fear. Even though in five years of working in a quiet staff position in the Watch I\u0027d learned not to be afraid of anything: the authorities, thugs, diseases . . . \u0027This was a second-degree intervention . . .\u0027 \u0027The boundary here\u0027s very subtle, Anton. You might be capable of more.\u0027 \u0027But we have more than ten third-grade magicians. Why am I a suspect?\u0027 \u0027Because you offended Zabulon personally. And he\u0027s quite capable of setting a trap just for Anton Gorodetsky. Or rather, adapting an old trap that was being kept in reserve.\u0027 I left without asking any more questions. Our lab\u0027s on the fourth floor too, but in the other wing of the building. I set off hurriedly along the corridor, nodding to people I met, but remained focused, clutching that disk tighter than a romantic young man clutches the hand of the girl he loves. Was the boss telling the truth? Could this really be aimed at me?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-30.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
