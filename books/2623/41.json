And we\u0027d break a few little unquestionable rules.\n People flowed past, giving me a wide berth. They sniffed the air in surprise, wondering where the smell of tobacco smoke was coming from. And I smoked, dropping the ash at my feet, eyeing the militiaman standing just five steps away and trying to figure out my chances.\n They turned out to be not that bad. Pretty good, in fact. And that bothered me.\n If they\u0027d been preparing this manoeuvre for three years, one option they must have taken into account was that I\u0027d see through it. They must have an answer for that – but what was it?\n It took me a second or two to register the startled look. And when I realised who was watching me, I gasped in surprise.\n Egor.\n The kid, the Other with potentially great powers who\u0027d got caught up in the battle between the two Watches three months ago. Played for a patsy by both sides. An open card that still hadn\u0027t been dealt. But players don\u0027t fight over cards like that.\n His powers were strong enough to penetrate my casual cover and the meeting itself didn\u0027t really come as a shock. There are many chance events in the world, but apart from that, there\u0027s also something called predetermination.\n \u0027Hi, Egor,\u0027 I said without even pausing to think. I expanded the range of the spell to include him in the circle of distraction.\n He started and looked around. Then he stared at me. Of course, he hadn\u0027t seen Olga in human form. Only as an owl.\n \u0027Who are you and how do you know me?\u0027\n Yes, he\u0027d grown. Not on the outside, on the inside. I couldn\u0027t understand how he could have avoided making his choice for so long and still not joined either the side of the Light or the Dark. He\u0027d already entered the Twilight, in circumstances that meant he could have gone either way. But his aura was still as pure and neutral as ever.\n His destiny was his own. It must be good to have your own destiny.\n \u0027I\u0027m Anton Gorodetsky, the Night Watch agent,\u0027 I said simply. \u0027Remember me?\u0027\n Of course he remembered me.\n \u0027But. . .\u0027\n \u0027Take no notice. It\u0027s a disguise, we can swap bodies.\u0027\n I wondered for a moment if I ought to think back to the course on illusion and temporarily restore my usual appearance. But there was no need – he believed me. Maybe because he remembered the boss\u0027s body swap.\n \u0027What do you want from me?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing, I\u0027m just waiting for a friend, the woman this body belongs to. You just happened to meet me here by chance.\u0027\n \u0027I hate your Watches!\u0027\n \u0027If you say so. But I really haven\u0027t been trailing you. You can go if you want.\u0027\n The kid found that far harder to believe than the idea of swapping bodies. He looked around suspiciously and frowned.\n Of course, it was hard for him to leave. He\u0027d touched the secret and sensed powers that went beyond the human world. And he\u0027d renounced those powers, at least for the time being.\n But I could imagine how much he wanted to learn – at least just a few little things, stuff like conjuring tricks with pyrokinesis and telekinesis, suggestion, healing, cursing – I didn\u0027t know what exactly, but he must have wanted to know how to do these things, not just know about them.\n \u0027You really haven\u0027t been trailing me?\u0027 he finally asked.\n \u0027No, I haven\u0027t. And we can\u0027t lie – not directly.\u0027\n \u0027How do I know that isn\u0027t a lie too?\u0027 the kid muttered, looking away. A logical question.\n \u0027You don\u0027t,\u0027 I agreed. \u0027Believe it if you want to.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like to,\u0027 he said, still looking down at the floor. \u0027But I remember what happened up there on the roof. I dream about it at night.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to be afraid of that vampire,\u0027 I said. \u0027She\u0027s been laid to rest. By order of the court.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027 I asked, surprised.\n \u0027Your boss called me. The one who swapped bodies that time.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know about that.\u0027\n \u0027He rang one day when there was no one else home. He said the vampire had been executed. And he said that since I was a potential Other, even if I hadn\u0027t made a choice yet, I\u0027d been taken off the list of humans. So I could never be selected by chance again, and I needn\u0027t be afraid.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027And I asked him if my parents were still on the list.\u0027\n I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say to that. I knew what the boss\u0027s answer had been.\n \u0027I\u0027ll be going, then,\u0027 said Egor, taking a step away. \u0027Your cigarette\u0027s finished.\u0027\n I dropped the butt and nodded.\n \u0027Where have you been? It\u0027s late.\u0027\n \u0027Training, I swim. Tell me, is that really you?\u0027\n \u0027You remember the trick with the broken cup?\u0027\n Egor gave a weak smile. It\u0027s always the cheapest tricks that impress people the most.\n \u0027I remember. Look—\u0027 He stopped short, staring past me.\n I turned round.\n It was strange to see myself from the outside. A man with my face, walking with my walk, wearing my jeans and sweater, with a walkman at his belt and a small bag in his hand. And that smile, so faint you could barely see it – that was mine. Even the eyes, those false mirrors, they were mine too.\n \u0027Hi, Anton,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027Good evening, Egor.\u0027\n She wasn\u0027t surprised to see the kid there. She seemed very calm altogether.\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 said Egor, looking first at her, then at me. \u0027Is Anton in your body now?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\n \u0027How do you know me?\u0027\n \u0027I saw you when I was in a different kind of body. Excuse us now, Anton\u0027s got serious problems and we\u0027ve got to deal with them.\u0027\n \u0027Should I go then?\u0027 Egor seemed to have forgotten that was what he\u0027d been just about to do.\n \u0027Yes. And don\u0027t get angry, things are going to get hot around here any moment, very hot.\u0027\n The kid looked at me.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got all of the Day Watch on my trail,\u0027 I explained. \u0027All the Dark Ones in Moscow.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a long story. You\u0027d better get off back home.\u0027\n It sounded rude. Egor frowned and nodded. He glanced in the direction of the platform, where a train was just pulling in.\n \u0027But they\u0027ll protect you, won\u0027t they?\u0027 He was still finding it hard to grasp which of us was in which body. \u0027Your Watch will?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ll try,\u0027 Olga replied gently. \u0027But now go, please. We haven\u0027t got much time, and it\u0027s disappearing fast.\u0027\n \u0027Goodbye,\u0027 said Egor, turning and running towards the train. His third step took him out of the circle of distraction and he was almost knocked off his feet.\n \u0027If the boy had stayed, I might have believed he was going to join our side,\u0027 Olga said as she watched him go. \u0027I\u0027d really like to check the probability lines to see why you met him in the metro.\u0027\n \u0027By chance.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing happens by chance. Ah, Anton, I used to be able to read reality lines like an open book, no problem.\u0027\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t mind having decent prevision.\u0027\n \u0027Genuine prevision isn\u0027t something you can just order from a catalogue. Now, back to business. You want to give my body back?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, right here.\u0027\n \u0027As you wish.\u0027 Olga stretched out her arms – my arms – and took hold of my shoulders. It gave me a stupid, ambiguous sort of feeling. She obviously felt the same thing, because she laughed and said: \u0027Why did you have to get yourself into this mess so soon, Anton? I had such extravagant plans for this evening.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe I should be grateful to the Maverick for disrupting your plans.\u0027\n Olga stopped smiling and concentrated.\n \u0027All right. Let\u0027s get on with it.\u0027\n We stood with our backs touching and held our arms out in the form of a cross. I took hold of Olga\u0027s fingers, which were also mine.\n \u0027Give back what is mine,\u0027 said Olga.\n \u0027Give back what is mine,\u0027 I repeated.\n \u0027Gesar, we return your gift!\u0027\n I started when I realised she\u0027d spoken the boss\u0027s real name. And what a name!\n \u0027Gesar, we return your gift!\u0027 Olga repeated sternly.\n \u0027Gesar, we return your gift!\u0027\n Olga switched into some ancient language, intoning the words gently, speaking as if it was her mother tongue. It hurt to feel how hard she had to strain to perform a piece of magic that really shouldn\u0027t have been difficult with second-grade powers.\n Changing bodies in reverse is like releasing a spring. Our minds had only been maintained in each other\u0027s bodies by the energy that Boris Ignatievich Gesar had transferred to us. All we had to do was relinquish that energy and we would resume our previous forms. If either of us had been a first-grade magician, we needn\u0027t even have been in physical contact, it could all have been done at a distance.\n Olga\u0027s voice soared as she pronounced the final formula of renunciation.\n For an instant nothing happened. Then I was racked by cramps and shooting pains, everything blurred and went grey in front of my eyes, as if I was sinking into the Twilight. For a moment I could see the whole station – the dusty stained-glass windows, the dirty floor, the slow movements of the people, the rainbows of their auras, two bodies thrashing about as if they\u0027d been crucified on each other.\n Then I was pressed and forced and squeezed into the shell of my body.\n I gasped as I fell to the floor, putting my hands out just at the last moment. My muscles were twitching, my ears were ringing. The reversal had been far more uncomfortable, maybe because it wasn\u0027t performed by the boss.\n \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 Olga asked feebly. \u0027Anton, we\u0027ve got about a quarter of an hour. Tell me everything.\u0027\n \u0027What exactly?\u0027\n \u0027What you\u0027ve figured out. Come on. You didn\u0027t just want to get back into your own body, you\u0027ve worked out some kind of plan.\u0027\n I nodded, then straightened up, dusted off my palms and brushed at my knees to clean off my jeans. The strap holding my holster was too tight under my arm, I had to loosen it. There weren\u0027t many people in the metro now, the flood tide had receded. But that meant those who were left weren\u0027t so busy manoeuvring through the crowd, and they had time to think: their auras flared up in bright rainbow colours and I caught the echoes of their owners\u0027 feelings.\n They\u0027d really limited Olga\u0027s powers. In her body it had cost me a lot of effort to observe the inner world of human feelings. But then, that was only a simple thing. Not even anything to feel proud of.\n \u0027It\u0027s not me the Day Watch want, Olga. They don\u0027t want me at all. I\u0027m an ordinary, average magician.\u0027\n She nodded.\n \u0027But I\u0027m the one they\u0027re hunting. There\u0027s no doubt about that. So if I\u0027m not the quarry, I must be the bait. The same way Egor was the bait when Sveta was the quarry.\u0027\n \u0027Have you only just realised that?\u0027 Olga shook her head. \u0027Of course. You\u0027re the bait.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-41.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
