{"id":101345,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"The unidentified magician was the only unknown in the equation, the X. We could designate Egor as Y: his resistance to magic was far too high for any novice Other. But on the other hand, the boy was an already known quantity, with just one undetermined factor . . . And that had been deliberately introduced into the problem, to make it more complicated. \u0027Zabulon!\u0027 I shouted. Behind my back Egor was scrabbling and sliding on the ice as he tried to stand up. Semyon was backing away from the magician, still maintaining his defences. Ilya was simply observing everything dispassionately. Bear was closing in on the twitching girl vampire as she tried to stand up. Tiger Cub and the witch Alisa were moving towards each other again. \u0027Zabulon!\u0027 The demon looked at me. \u0027I know who you\u0027re fighting for!\u0027 But I didn\u0027t know yet. I was just beginning to understand, because the pieces of the jigsaw had come together and shown me a familiar face . . . The demon opened its jaws – they shifted to the left and the right, like a beetle\u0027s. He was looking more and more like some huge insect, his scales had grown together into a single carapace, his genitals and tail had retracted, new limbs had begun to sprout from his sides. \u0027Then you\u0027re dead.\u0027 His voice was the same as before, in fact it sounded even more thoughtful and intelligent. Zabulon stretched his arm out towards me – it extended in jerks, growing new joints as it came. \u0027Come to me . . .\u0027 whispered Zabulon. Everybody froze – apart from me. I started walking towards the Dark Magician. There was barely a trace left of the mental defences I\u0027d nurtured for years. There was just no way I could not obey Zabulon. \u0027Stop!\u0027 roared Tiger Cub, turning away from the battered but still snarling witch. \u0027Stop!\u0027 I really wished I could do as she said, but I couldn\u0027t. \u0027Anton . . .\u0027 I heard someone say behind me. \u0027Look back . . .\u0027 That was something I could do. I turned my head, tearing my eyes away from the gaze of those amber eyes with their narrow, vertical slit pupils. Egor was still squatting down, he didn\u0027t have the strength to get up. It was incredible that he was even conscious at all . . . after all, the external input into his energy reserves had been shut off. The external input that had attracted the boss\u0027s attention, that had been maintained from the very beginning. Factor Y. Introduced to complicate the situation. A small ivory medallion on a copper chain dangled from Egor\u0027s hand. \u0027Catch!\u0027 the kid shouted. \u0027Don\u0027t take it!\u0027 Zabulon ordered me. But he was too late, I\u0027d already bent down and grabbed the amulet as it came flying towards my feet. The carved medallion burned my hand when I touched it, as if I\u0027d picked up a live coal. I looked at the demon and shook my head: \u0027Zabulon, you no longer have power over me.\u0027 The demon howled and came straight at me. His power over me was gone, but he still had plenty of strength. \u0027Tut-tut!\u0027 said Ilya. A wall of white flame cut across the space between us. Zabulon howled as he hit the magical barrier and the sheet of pure white light flung him back. He shook his scorched paws, looking ridiculous now, not terrible at all. \u0027A complex move,\u0027 I said. \u0027But elementary really, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Everything on the roof went quiet. Tiger Cub and the witch Alisa stood side by side, not even trying to attack each other. Semyon looked at me, then at Ilya, and I couldn\u0027t tell which of us had surprised him most. The vampire was crying quietly, as she tried to get up. She was in the worst state of all, she\u0027d used up all her strength to survive the fight with Bear, and now she was struggling to regenerate. With an incredible effort she left the Twilight, becoming a vague silhouette. Even the wind seemed to have died away . . . \u0027How can you make a Dark Magician out of someone who is fundamentally pure?\u0027 I asked. \u0027How can you win over to the Dark Side a person who doesn\u0027t know how to hate? You can rain difficulties on him whichever way he turns ... a little at a time, hoping that he\u0027ll become embittered . . . But that doesn\u0027t work. This person . . . this girl ... is too pure.\u0027 Ilya gave a quiet laugh of approval. \u0027The only thing that she could hate,\u0027 I said, looking into Zabulon\u0027s eyes, now filled with nothing but powerless malice, \u0027is herself. And that\u0027s the clever move. Unexpected. Let her mother fall ill. Let the girl devour her very soul, despising her own weakness and refusal to help. Drive her into a corner so tight, there\u0027s nothing else she can feel but hate, even if that hate is for herself. Of course, there is a divergence of probabilities. Just a slight chance that a single Night Watch agent who doesn\u0027t really know all that much about field work—\u0027 My knees started to buckle – I wasn\u0027t used to staying in the Twilight this long. I would have fallen on my knees in front of Zabulon, something I really didn\u0027t want to do, but Semyon slipped through the Twilight and supported me by the shoulders. He\u0027d probably been doing that for a hundred and fifty years too. \u0027About field work . . .\u0027 I repeated. \u0027Might suddenly not behave according to plan, not trying to pity and comfort a girl for whom pity is fatal. He had to be distracted. A situation had to be created that would keep him busy. He had to be given a secondary assignment, and feel obliged to carry out that assignment for professional and personal reasons – anything that came to hand would do. An ordinary vampire could be sacrificed for that, couldn\u0027t he?\u0027 Zabulon began transforming back to human form, assuming his former appearance as a mournful-looking intellectual. That was odd. What for? When I\u0027d already seen what he\u0027d become in the Twilight, what he\u0027d become once and for ever. \u0027A complex manoeuvre,\u0027 I repeated. \u0027I\u0027ll bet Svetlana\u0027s mother doesn\u0027t really have to die from any fatal illness at all. That was a minor intervention from your side, within the permitted limits. . . But then we have rights too.\u0027 \u0027She ours!\u0027 said Zabulon. \u0027No.\u0027 I shook my head. \u0027The Inferno\u0027s not going to erupt. Her mother\u0027s going to get well. I\u0027m going straight to the girl now . . . and I\u0027m going to tell her everything. Svetlana will join the Night Watch. You\u0027ve lost, Zabulon. No matter what you do, you\u0027ve lost.\u0027 The tatters of clothes scattered across the roof crept towards the Dark Magician, grew together and sprang up on to his body, reclothing the sad, charming intellectual grieving for the whole world. \u0027None of you will leave here,\u0027 said Zabulon. The Dark began thickening behind his back, like two immense black wings unfurling. Ilya laughed again. \u0027I\u0027m stronger than all of you,\u0027 said Zabulon. \u0027Your borrowed powers are not unlimited. You will stay here for ever, in the Twilight, deeper than you have ever dared to look . . .\u0027 Semyon sighed and said: \u0027Anton, he still hasn\u0027t got the picture.\u0027 I looked round and asked: \u0027Boris Ignatievich, don\u0027t you think you could drop the playacting now?\u0027 The bumptious young field operative shrugged: \u0027Of course, Antosha. But I don\u0027t often get a chance to observe the head of the Day Watch in action. Don\u0027t hold that against an old man. I hope Ilya found it just as interesting being me . . .\u0027 Boris Ignatievich resumed his normal form. Instantly, without any theatrical intermediate stages or light effects. He was still dressed in his gown and skullcap, but he was wearing soft moccasins on his feet, with galoshes over them. Zabulon\u0027s face was a sight. The dark wings didn\u0027t disappear, but they stopped growing and flapped hesitantly, as if the magician was thinking about flying away, but couldn\u0027t quite make up his mind. \u0027Wind up this operation, Zabulon,\u0027 the boss said. \u0027If you withdraw immediately from this building and from Svetlana\u0027s house, we won\u0027t lodge an official protest.\u0027 The Dark Magician didn\u0027t hesitate. \u0027We\u0027ll withdraw.\u0027 The boss nodded, as if he\u0027d never expected any other answer. Just for a moment I thought . . . He lowered the wand, and the barrier between me and Zabulon disappeared. \u0027I\u0027ll remember the part you played in this. . .\u0027 the Dark Magician murmured. \u0027For ever.\u0027 \u0027Do,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s good to remember.\u0027 Zabulon brought his hands together – the mighty wings flapped, and the magician disappeared. But before he went, he glanced at the witch – and she nodded. I didn\u0027t like that at all. A spiteful parting gesture may not be fatal, but it\u0027s never pleasant. Alisa came over to me, walking with a light, dancing step completely out of keeping with her bloody face and dangling, dislocated left arm. \u0027You must leave too,\u0027 said the boss. \u0027Of course, I\u0027ll be only too delighted,\u0027 replied the witch. \u0027But before I do, I have one small, very small, debt to collect. Isn\u0027t that right, Anton?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 I send quietly. \u0027A seventh-degree intervention.\u0027 Who would she strike her blow at? Not the boss, the idea was ludicrous. Tiger Cub, Bear, Semyon . . . that would be stupid. Egor? What suggestion could she implant in him at the very weakest level of intervention? \u0027Open yourself,\u0027 said the witch. \u0027Open yourself to me, Anton. A seventh-degree intervention. The head of the Night Watch is a witness: I won\u0027t overstep the mark.\u0027 Semyon groaned, squeezing my shoulder so tight it hurt. \u0027She has the right,\u0027 I said. \u0027Boris Ignatievich . . .\u0027 \u0027Whatever you say,\u0027 the boss answered softly. \u0027I\u0027m watching.\u0027 I sighed and laid myself open to the witch. There was nothing she could do. Nothing. A seventh-degree intervention – she could never turn me to the Dark with that. The idea was simply ridiculous. \u0027Anton,\u0027 the witch said gently. \u0027Tell your boss what you wanted to say. Tell the truth. Act honestly and correctly. The way you ought to act.\u0027 \u0027Minimal intervention . . .\u0027 the boss confirmed. If there was any pain in his voice, it was so deeply hidden that I couldn\u0027t hear it. \u0027A complex manoeuvre,\u0027 I said, glancing at Boris Ignatievich. \u0027From both sides. The Day Watch sacrifices its pawns, and the Night Watch does the same. For the great goal. In order to win over to their side a sorceress of immense, unprecedented power. A young vampire who is longing for love may die. A young kid with undetermined powers may disappear for ever in the Twilight. Operatives may be hurt. But there\u0027s an end that justifies the means. Two great magicians who have opposed each other for hundreds of years cook up another little war. And the Light Magician is in the toughest spot ... he has to stake everything. And for him to lose would be more than an inconvenience, it\u0027s a step into the Twilight, into the Twilight for all time. But still he stakes everyone\u0027s lives. His own side\u0027s and the other\u0027s. Right, Boris Ignatievich?\u0027 \u0027Right,\u0027 replied the boss. Alisa laughed and walked towards the trapdoor. The witch was in no shape to fly. Tiger Cub had given her quite a mauling. But even after that she was feeling cheerful. I looked at Semyon and he turned his eyes away. Tiger Cub slowly transformed back into a girl . . . also trying not to look me in the eye. Bear gave a short, sharp howl and trudged towards the trapdoor without changing his form. It was toughest of all for him. He was too uncompromising. Bear, the great warrior and opponent of all compromise . . . \u0027You\u0027re all bastards,\u0027 said Egor. He stood up, moving awkwardly – not just because he was tired, the boss was feeding his reserves now, I could see the fine thread of power running through the air – but because at first it\u0027s always hard to tear yourself out of your shadow. I was the next out. It wasn\u0027t difficult, during the last quarter of an hour so much energy had been splashed into the Twilight that it had lost its usual aggressive clamminess.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-27.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
