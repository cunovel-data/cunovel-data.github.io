{"id":101322,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027Night Watch,\u0027 I said. I held my hand out, holding the amulet. It was discharged, but that\u0027s not so easy to sense at a distance. \u0027Leave the Twilight!\u0027\\n\\n The male vampire would probably have obeyed me, hoping that I didn\u0027t know about the trail of blood he\u0027d left behind him, that the whole business could just be written off as \u0027an attempt at unauthorised interaction with a human\u0027. But the girl lacked his self-control, she didn\u0027t have the wit to get it.\\n\\n \u0027A-a-a-agh!\u0027 She threw herself at me with a long, drawn-out howl. It was a good thing she still hadn\u0027t sunk her teeth into the boy; she was out of her mind now, like a desperate junkie who\u0027s just stuck a needle in his vein only to have it jerked back out again, like a nymphomaniac after her man\u0027s pulled out just a moment before coming.\\n\\n That dash would have been too fast for any human, no one could have parried it.\\n\\n But I was in the same dimension of reality as the girl vampire. I threw up my arm and splashed vodka from the open bottle into her hideously transformed face.\\n\\n Why do vampires tolerate alcohol so poorly?\\n\\n The menacing scream became a shrill squeal. The girl began whirling around on the spot, beating her hands against her face as it shed layers of skin and greyish flesh. The male vampire swung round, all set to run.\\n\\n This was going too easily altogether. A registered vampire isn\u0027t some casual visitor I have to fight on equal terms. I threw the bottle at the girl, reached out my hand and grabbed hold of the cord of the man\u0027s registration tag, which had unravelled on command. The vampire gave a hoarse croak and clutched at his throat.\\n\\n \u0027Leave the Twilight!\u0027 I yelled.\\n\\n I think he realised things were looking really bad now. He flung himself towards me, trying to reduce the pressure from the cord, extending his fangs and transforming as he came.\\n\\n If the amulet had been fully charged, I could have simply stunned him.\\n\\n As it was, I had to kill him.\\n\\n The tag – a seal on the vampire\u0027s chest that gave off a faint blue glow – made a crunching sound as I gave the silent order. The energy implanted in it by someone with far greater skill than me flooded into the dead body. The vampire was still running. He was well fed and strong, other people\u0027s lives were still nourishing his dead flesh. But he couldn\u0027t possibly resist such a powerful blow: his skin shrivelled until it was stretched as taut as parchment over his bones, slime gushed from his eye sockets. Then his spine shattered and the twitching remains collapsed at my feet.\\n\\n I swung round – the girl vampire could have regenerated already. But there was no danger. She was running across the yard between the buildings, taking huge strides. She still hadn\u0027t left the Twilight, so I was the only one who could see this extraordinary sight. Apart from the dogs, of course. Somewhere off to one side a small dog broke into hysterical barking, transfixed simultaneously by hatred and fear, and all the other feelings that dogs have felt for the living dead for time immemorial.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have enough strength left to chase her. I straightened up and captured a 3D image of her aura – grey, desiccated, rotten. We\u0027d find her. There was nowhere she could hide now.\\n\\n But where was the boy?\\n\\n After he emerged from the Twilight created by the vampires, he could have fainted or fallen into a trance. But he wasn\u0027t in the alley. He couldn\u0027t have run past me ... I ran from the alley into the yard and saw him. He was bolting, moving almost as fast as the vampire. Well, good for him! That was wonderful. No help required. It was unfortunate that he would remember everything that had happened, but then who would believe a young boy? And before morning all his memories would fade and assume the less menacing features of a fantastic nightmare.\\n\\n Or should I really go after him?\\n\\n \u0027Anton!\u0027\\n\\n Igor and Garik, our inseparable duo, came running down the alley from the avenue.\\n\\n \u0027The girl got away!\u0027 I shouted.\\n\\n Garik kicked out at the vampire\u0027s shrivelled corpse as he ran, sending a cloud of rotten dust flying up into the frosty air. He shouted:\\n\\n \u0027The image!\u0027\\n\\n I sent him the image of the girl vampire running away. Garik frowned and ran faster. Both operatives headed off in pursuit. Igor shouted as he ran:\\n\\n \u0027Clear up the trash!\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, as if they needed an answer, and emerged from my own Twilight. The world blossomed. The operatives\u0027 silhouettes melted away and their invisible feet even stopped leaving tracks in the snow lying in the human dimension of reality.\\n\\n I sighed and walked over to the grey Volvo parked at the kerb. There were a few primitive implements lying on the back seat: a heavy-duty plastic sack, a shovel and a small brush. It took me about five minutes to scrape up the vampire\u0027s feather-light remains and put the sack in the trunk. I took some dirty snow from a melting pile left by a careless yard-keeper, scattered it in the alley and trampled it a bit, working the final dusty, rotten remains into the slush. No human burial for you . . .\\n\\n That was that.\\n\\n I went back to the car, got into the driving seat and unbuttoned my jacket. I felt good. Very good, in fact. The senior vampire was dead, the guys would pick up his girlfriend and the boy was alive.\\n\\n I could just imagine how delighted the boss would be.\\n\\n CHAPTER 2\\n\\n \u0027SLOPPY WORK!\u0027\\n\\n I tried to say something, but the next remark stung like a slap on the cheek and shut me up.\\n\\n \u0027You screwed up!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you at least understand your own mistakes?\u0027\\n\\n The boss had cooled off a bit and I took the risk of raising my eyes from the floor and saying cautiously:\\n\\n \u0027It seems to me . . .\u0027\\n\\n I like being in that office. It stirs the child\u0027s heart in me to see all those amusing little trinkets on the shelves in the bullet-proof glass cupboards, hanging on the walls. Everything there – from the old Japanese fan to the jagged piece of metal with a deer welded on to it – the symbol of some car plant – each had its own history. If you were lucky and the boss was in the right mood, you could hear some very interesting stories.\\n\\n Only I don\u0027t seem to find him in that kind of mood too often.\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 The boss stopped striding round the office, sat down in a leather armchair and lit up. \u0027Let\u0027s hear it.\u0027\\n\\n His voice had turned businesslike, matching his appearance. To the human eye he looked about forty years old, and he belonged to that narrow circle of businessmen that the government likes to rely on so much.\\n\\n \u0027What do you want to hear?\u0027 I asked, at the risk of provoking another tirade.\\n\\n \u0027The mistakes. Your mistakes.\u0027\\n\\n Right then . . . Okay.\\n\\n \u0027My first mistake, Boris Ignatievich,\u0027 I said with a perfectly innocent air, \u0027was that I failed to understand the nature of the mission correctly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I assumed my goal was to track down a vampire who had begun actively hunting in Moscow. To track him down and . . . er . . . neutralise him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on, go on . . .\u0027 the boss encouraged me.\\n\\n \u0027In actual fact, the essential purpose of the mission was to ascertain my suitability for operational activity, for field work. Starting from my incorrect understanding of the mission, that is, following the principle of \"separate and protect\" . . .\u0027\\n\\n The boss sighed and nodded. Anyone who didn\u0027t know him too well might even have thought he was ashamed.\\n\\n \u0027And did you contravene this principle in any way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, and that\u0027s why I botched the mission.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How did you botch it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right at the beginning . . .\u0027 I squinted sideways at a stuffed snowy owl standing on shelf behind the glass. Had it really moved its head? \u0027Right at the beginning I drained the amulet in a futile attempt to neutralise a black vortex . . .\u0027\\n\\n Boris Ignatievich frowned. He brushed his hair back with his hand.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, let\u0027s start with that. I\u0027ve studied the image, and if you haven\u0027t touched it up . . .\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head indignantly.\\n\\n \u0027I believe you. Well, a vortex like that can\u0027t be removed with an amulet. Do you remember the classification?\u0027\\n\\n Damn! Why hadn\u0027t I looked at my old notes?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t. But it doesn\u0027t matter. There is no class for this vortex. There\u0027s no way you could possibly have dealt with it . . .\u0027 The boss leaned across the desk and continued in a mysterious whisper: \u0027. . . and you know what . . .\u0027\\n\\n I was all ears.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no way I could have either, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n This confession was unexpected, and I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. Maybe no one had ever actually said out loud that the boss could do anything, but that was what everyone at the office believed.\\n\\n \u0027Anton, a vortex as strong as that can only be removed by the person who created it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have to find him . . .\u0027 I said uncertainly. \u0027I feel sorry for the girl . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t about her. Not just about her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I blurted out and then hastily corrected myself. \u0027We have to stop the Dark Magician, don\u0027t we?\u0027\\n\\n The boss sighed.\\n\\n \u0027He might have a licence. He might be entitled to cast the curse . . . This isn\u0027t even about the magician. A black vortex as powerful as that . . . You remember the plane that crashed last winter?\u0027\\n\\n I shuddered. It wasn\u0027t that we\u0027d done anything wrong, it had more to do with a loophole in the law: a pilot who was under a curse had lost control and his airliner had crashed into a residential area of the city. Hundreds of innocent lives . . .\\n\\n \u0027Vortices like that can\u0027t act selectively. The girl\u0027s doomed, but it won\u0027t just be a brick that accidentally falls off some roof on to her head. More likely a building will explode, there\u0027ll be an epidemic, or someone will drop an atom bomb on Moscow by mistake. That\u0027s the real problem, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n The boss suddenly swung round and cast a withering glance at the owl. It folded its wings away quickly and the gleam in its glass eyes faded.\\n\\n \u0027Boris Ignatievich,\u0027 I said, horrified. \u0027I\u0027m at fault. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course you are. There\u0027s only one redeeming aspect, Anton.\u0027 The boss cleared his throat. \u0027When you gave way to pity, you acted quite correctly. The amulet couldn\u0027t completely detach the vortex, but it has postponed the Inferno for a while. And now we have a day to work with, maybe even two. I\u0027ve always believed that ill-considered but well-intentioned actions do more good than actions that are well considered but cruel. If you hadn\u0027t used the amulet, half of Moscow would already be in ruins.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are we going to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look for the girl. Protect her ... as well as we can. We\u0027ll be able to destabilise the vortex again once or twice. And in the meantime we\u0027ll have to find the magician who cast the curse and make him remove the vortex.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Everybody will be involved in the search,\u0027 the boss said casually. \u0027I\u0027ve recalled everyone from holiday, Ilya will be back from Sri Lanka by morning and the others will be here by lunchtime. The weather\u0027s bad in Europe. I\u0027ve asked our colleagues in the European office to help, but by the time they can disperse the clouds . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By morning?\u0027 I asked, glancing at my watch. \u0027Another whole day.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-4.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
