{"id":101326,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u0027I have a special assignment. You can direct your enquiry to my superiors. Or rather, you have the right to address your enquiry to your superiors.\u0027 The witch and the warlock exchanged glances. No matter how opposed our goals and moralities might be, the two hierarchies had to collaborate. Only, to be quite frank, nobody really liked involving the bosses. \u0027Very well,\u0027 the witch agreed reluctantly. \u0027Anton, we will limit ourselves to a verbal warning.\u0027 I looked around. All round me there were people, moving slowly through the grey gloom. Ordinary people, incapable of moving out of their own little world. We were Others, and though I stood on the Light Side and the other two were on the Dark Side, we had far more in common with each other than with any of those ordinary humans. \u0027On what terms?\u0027 You should never try to second-guess the Dark. You should never make any concessions. And it\u0027s even more dangerous to accept any gifts from it. But rules are only made to be broken. \u0027No terms.\u0027 Well, that was a surprise! I looked at Alisa, trying to figure out the catch. Pyotr was obviously indignant at his partner, he was angry, he wanted to expose an adept of the Light as a criminal. That meant I didn\u0027t have to worry about him. But where was the trap? \u0027That\u0027s unacceptable to me,\u0027 I said, with a sigh of relief – I\u0027d spotted the catch. \u0027Alisa, thank you for your offer of a peaceful resolution. I can accept it, but in a similar situation I am bound to forgive you a minor magical intervention, up to and including the seventh degree.\u0027 \u0027Very well, Other,\u0027 Alisa agreed readily. She held out her hand and I automatically shook it. \u0027We have a personal agreement.\u0027 The owl on my shoulder flapped its wings. There was a furious screech right in my ear. And a moment later the bird materialised in the Twilight world. Alisa took a step back and the pupils of her eyes rapidly extended into vertical slits. The young warlock took up a defensive stance. \u0027We have an agreement,\u0027 the witch repeated sullenly. What was going on? I realised too late that I shouldn\u0027t have entered into an agreement while Olga was there. But then – what was so terrible about what had happened? As if I hadn\u0027t been there when other guys from the Watch had concluded alliances like this, made concessions, agreed terms for co-operating with the Dark Ones, even the boss himself had done it! Sure, it\u0027s undesirable, but sometimes you have to. Our goal is not to exterminate the Dark Ones. Our goal is to maintain the balance. The Dark Ones will only disappear when people conquer the Evil in themselves. Or we\u0027ll disappear, if people decide they like the Dark better than the Light. \u0027The agreement\u0027s been made,\u0027 I told the owl. \u0027Cool it. It\u0027s no big deal. Just standard collaboration.\u0027 Alisa smiled and gave me a wave. She took the warlock by the elbow, and they started moving off. A few moments later they were out of the Twilight and setting off along the pavement. An ordinary young couple. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Well? Field work has always been built on compromises.\u0027 \u0027You made a mistake.\u0027 Olga\u0027s voice was strange, it didn\u0027t match her appearance. Soft, velvety, musical. The way werecats talk, not birds. \u0027Oh! So you can talk now?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Then why didn\u0027t you say anything before?\u0027 \u0027Everything was okay before.\u0027 I laughed, remembering the old joke about the child that didn\u0027t speak for years. \u0027I\u0027ll leave the Twilight, okay? And meanwhile you can explain what mistake I\u0027ve made. Minor compromises with the Dark Ones are inevitable in this line of work.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not well enough qualified to make compromises.\u0027 The world around me became coloured. It was like switching modes on a video camera, when you change from \u0027sepia\u0027 or \u0027old movie\u0027 to the standard view. The comparison is really quite apt in some ways: the Twilight is an \u0027old movie\u0027. A really old one that humankind has managed to forget. They find it easier to live that way. I set off towards the steps down into the metro, snarling to my invisible companion on the way: \u0027And just what have qualifications got to do with it?\u0027 \u0027A high-ranking Watch member is able to foresee the consequences of a compromise. Whether it\u0027s no more than just a minor trade-off and the effects are self-neutralising, or a trap, a trick.\u0027 \u0027I doubt if a seventh-grade intervention\u0027s likely to lead to disaster.\u0027 A man walking along beside me glanced at me in surprise. I was just about to say something like: \u0027I\u0027m harmless, the non-violent kind of psycho.\u0027 It\u0027s a great way of curing excessive curiosity. But the man had already lengthened his stride, probably having come to a similar conclusion himself. \u0027Anton, you can\u0027t predict the consequences. You overreacted to a minor annoyance. Your little piece of magic led to intervention by the Dark Ones. You agreed a compromise with them. But the saddest thing of all is that there was no need for magical intervention in the first place.\u0027 \u0027Okay, okay, I admit it. So now what?\u0027 The bird\u0027s voice was sounding more lifelike now, developing more expression. I suppose it must have been a long time since she\u0027d last spoken. \u0027Now – nothing. We\u0027ll have to hope for the best.\u0027 \u0027Are you going to tell the boss what happened?\u0027 \u0027No. At least, not yet. We\u0027re partners, after all.\u0027 I felt a warm glow. This sudden improvement in relations with my partner made any mistakes worthwhile. \u0027Thanks. So what do you advise?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re doing everything right. Look for the trail.\u0027 I\u0027d have preferred rather less standard advice . . . \u0027Let\u0027s go.\u0027 By two o\u0027clock, along with the circle line, I\u0027d combed the entire grey line too. Maybe I am a lousy operational agent, but there was no way I could have failed to spot the trail from yesterday, when I\u0027d captured the image myself. The girl with the black vortex spinning over her head hadn\u0027t got out here. I\u0027d have to go back and start again from the point where we\u0027d met. At Kurskaya I went up the escalator and out of the metro and bought a plastic tub of salad and a coffee from a van on the street. The very sight of the hamburgers and sausages made me feel sick, even though the amount of meat in them was strictly symbolic. \u0027Will you have something?\u0027 I asked my invisible companion. \u0027No, thank you.\u0027 Standing there with the fine snow falling on me, I picked at my salad with a tiny plastic fork and sipped the hot coffee. A bum who\u0027d been counting on me buying a beer, so that he could have the empty bottle, hung about for a bit and then took off into the metro to get warm. Nobody else paid any attention to me. The girl behind the counter served the hungry passers-by, faceless streams of people flooded from the station and back towards it. The salesman at a bookstall was trying wearily and unenthusiastically to foist some book or other on a customer, who didn\u0027t like the price. \u0027I must be in a bad mood or something . . .\u0027 I muttered. \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Everything looks dark and miserable. All the people are low-lifes and idiots, the salad\u0027s frozen, my boots feel damp.\u0027 The bird on my shoulder screeched. \u0027No, Anton, it\u0027s not just your mood. You can sense the approach of the Inferno.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not noted for being particularly sensitive.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just the point.\u0027 I glanced at the station and tried to get a close look at people\u0027s faces. Some of them were sensing it too. The ones who stood right on the line between human and Other were tense and depressed. They couldn\u0027t understand why, so they were compensating by acting cheerful. \u0027Dark and Light. . . What will it be when it happens, Olga?\u0027 \u0027Anything at all. You delayed the time of the eruption, but now when the vortex strikes the consequences will be absolutely catastrophic. That\u0027s the effect of delay.\u0027 \u0027The boss didn\u0027t tell me that.\u0027 \u0027Why should he? You did the right thing. Now at least there\u0027s a chance.\u0027 \u0027Olga, how old are you?\u0027 I asked. Between humans the question might have been taken as an insult. But for us age doesn\u0027t have any particular limits. \u0027Very old, Anton. For instance, I can remember the uprising.\u0027 \u0027The revolution?\u0027 \u0027The uprising on Senate Square, in 1825.\u0027 The owl chortled. I didn\u0027t say anything. She could be even older than the boss. \u0027What\u0027s your rank?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I don\u0027t have one. I was stripped of all rights.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027No problem. I came to terms with it a long time ago.\u0027 Her voice was still cheerful, even mocking. But something told me Olga had never come to terms with it. \u0027If you don\u0027t mind me asking . . . Why did they shut you in that body?\u0027 \u0027There was no other option. Living in a wolf\u0027s body is much harder.\u0027 \u0027Wait . . .\u0027 I dropped the remains of the salad in a bin. I looked at my shoulder, but, of course, I didn\u0027t see the owl – to do that I would have had to withdraw into the Twilight. \u0027What are you? If you\u0027re a shape-shifter, then why are you with us? If you\u0027re a magician, then why such an unusual punishment?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s got nothing to do with the job, Anton.\u0027 For just a moment there was a hint of steel in her voice. \u0027But it all started with me compromising with the Dark Ones. Only a small compromise. I thought I\u0027d calculated the consequences, but I was wrong.\u0027 So that was it . . . \u0027Was that why you started talking? You wanted to warn me off, but you were too late?\u0027 No answer. As if Olga was already regretting being so frank. \u0027Let\u0027s get on with the job,\u0027 I said. And just then the phone buzzed in my pocket. It was Larissa. What was she doing working two straight shifts? \u0027Anton, listen carefully . . . They\u0027ve picked up that girl\u0027s trail. Perovo station.\u0027 \u0027Shit,\u0027 was all I said. Working the commuter suburbs was hell. \u0027Right,\u0027 Larissa agreed. She was no field operative . . . that was probably why she was sitting by the phone. But she was a bright girl. \u0027Anton, get over to Perovo. All our team are concentrating over there, they\u0027re following the trail. And another thing . . . they\u0027ve spotted the Day Watch there.\u0027 \u0027I get the picture.\u0027 I folded away my phone. I didn\u0027t get it. Did the Dark Ones already know everything? Were they just yearning for the Inferno to erupt? Then maybe it was no accident that they\u0027d stopped me? Rubbish. A major disaster in Moscow was hardly in the interests of the Dark. But of course, they wouldn\u0027t try to stop the twister either: that would be to go against their nature. So I didn\u0027t go by metro after all. I stopped a car. It ought to save me a bit of time, even if not much. I sat beside the driver, a swarthy intellectual about forty years old. The car was new, and the driver gave the impression of doing very well for himself. It seemed a bit odd for him to be earning a bit on the side by offering a taxi service.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-8.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
