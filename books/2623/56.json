Moscow\u0027s been left without a single Watch operative!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Dark Ones have gone quiet too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, that\u0027s enough.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, realising I wouldn\u0027t be able to get another word out of her.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, Olya. Six months ago we were on equal terms, even if it was only by accident. Now we\u0027re obviously not. I\u0027m sorry. This is a problem for someone with the proper competence to deal with.\u0027\\n\\n Olga nodded. It was so unexpected I could hardly believe it.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve finally got the idea.\u0027\\n\\n Was she fooling me? Or did she really believe I\u0027d decided not to interfere?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m pretty quick on the uptake,\u0027 I said. I looked at Svetlana. She was chatting happily with Tolik.\\n\\n \u0027Are you angry with me?\u0027 Olga asked.\\n\\n I touched her hand, smiled and went into the house. I wanted to do something. I wanted to do something as badly as a genie who\u0027s been let out of his bottle for the first time in a thousand years. Anything at all: raise up castles, lay waste to cities, program in Basic or embroider in cross-stitch.\\n\\n I opened the door without touching it, by pushing at it through the Twilight. I don\u0027t know why I did it. I don\u0027t often do things like that, just sometimes when I\u0027ve drunk a lot, or when I get really angry. The former wasn\u0027t the case here.\\n\\n There was no one in the sitting room. Why would anyone want to sit inside, when outside there were hot kebabs, cold wine and more than enough loungers beneath the trees.\\n\\n I flopped down into an armchair, picked up my glass – or Sveta\u0027s – from the low table and filled it with cognac, then downed it in one, as if it was cheap vodka, not fifteen-year-old Prazdnichny. I poured myself another glass.\\n\\n That was when Tiger Cub came in.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t mind, do you?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Of course not.\u0027 The sorceress sat down beside me. \u0027Anton, has something upset you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take no notice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you had a quarrel with Sveta?\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, have I done something wrong? Aren\u0027t the guys having a good time?\u0027\\n\\n I stared at her in genuine amazement.\\n\\n \u0027Tiger Cub, don\u0027t be stupid! Everything\u0027s just great. Everyone\u0027s enjoying themselves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you?\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027d never seen the shape-shifting sorceress look so uncertain of herself. Were they having a good time or weren\u0027t they? You can\u0027t please everyone.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re continuing with Svetlana\u0027s training,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027What for?\u0027 she asked with a slight frown.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. For something that Olga couldn\u0027t do. For something very dangerous and very important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s good.\u0027 She reached for a glass, poured herself some cognac and took a sip.\\n\\n \u0027Good?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure. That they\u0027re training her, giving her direction.\u0027 Tiger Cub looked around, trying to find something, then frowned and looked at the music centre by the wall. \u0027That remote\u0027s always going missing,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n The music centre lit up and Queen started to play \u0027It\u0027s a Kind of Magic\u0027. I was impressed by how casually she did it. Controlling electronic circuits at a distance isn\u0027t a simple trick, it\u0027s not like drilling holes in a wall just by looking at it or keeping mosquitoes away with fireballs.\\n\\n \u0027How long did you train to work in the Watch?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027From when I was about seven years old. At sixteen, I was already involved in field operations.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nine years! And it\u0027s easier for you – your magic\u0027s natural. They\u0027re planning to turn Svetlana into a Great Sorceress in six months or a year!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s tough going,\u0027 the young woman agreed. \u0027Do you think the boss is wrong?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged. To say the boss was wrong would have been about as stupid as denying that the sun rises in the east in the morning. He\u0027d been learning how not to make mistakes for hundreds – even thousands – of years. Gesar might act harshly, even cruelly. He might provoke the Dark Ones and leave the Light Ones to carry the can. He might do anything at all. Except make a mistake.\\n\\n \u0027I think he\u0027s overestimating Sveta\u0027s strength,\u0027 I ventured.\\n\\n \u0027Come off it! The boss calculates everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know he calculates everything. He plays the old game very well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And he wishes Sveta well,\u0027 the sorceress added stubbornly. \u0027Do you understand that? In his own way, maybe. You would have acted differently, so would I, or Semyon, or Olga. Any one of us would have done things differently. But he\u0027s in charge of the Watch. And he has every right to be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So he knows best?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what about freedom?\u0027 I asked, pouring myself another glass. I didn\u0027t really need it, my head was already starting to hum. \u0027Freedom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You talk like the Dark Ones do,\u0027 the young woman snorted.\\n\\n \u0027I prefer to think they talk like I do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all very simple, Anton.\u0027 Tiger Cub leaned down over me and looked in my eyes. She smelled of cognac and something else, a light floral smell. It wasn\u0027t likely to be perfume: shape-shifters don\u0027t like anything that is scented. \u0027You\u0027re in love with her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure, I\u0027m in love with her. That\u0027s not news.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know she\u0027ll soon be on a higher level of power than you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If she isn\u0027t already.\u0027 I didn\u0027t mention it, but I remembered how easily Sveta had sensed the magical screens in the walls.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027ll go way beyond you. Her powers will totally dwarf yours. Her problems will seem incomprehensible to you, they\u0027ll seem bizarre. Stay with her and you\u0027ll start to feel like a useless parasite, a gigolo, you\u0027ll be clutching at the past.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 I nodded and was surprised to notice my glass was already empty. My hostess watched me closely as I filled it again. \u0027So I shan\u0027t stay. I don\u0027t need that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there isn\u0027t anything else on offer.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027d never suspected that she could be so hard. I hadn\u0027t expected her to be so concerned about whether everyone liked her hospitality and her home, and I hadn\u0027t expected to hear this bitter truth from her either.\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you know that, Anton, there\u0027s only one reason you\u0027re feeling so outraged about the boss dragging Sveta upwards so fast.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My time will soon be gone,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s sand running through my fingers, rain falling from the sky.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your time? Yours and hers, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was never ours, never.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n It was a good question. I shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027You know, there are some animals that don\u0027t reproduce in captivity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There you go again!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027What captivity? You should be glad for her. Svetlana will be the pride of the Light Ones. You were the first to discover her, it was you who saved her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For what? One more battle with the Dark? An unnecessary battle?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, now you\u0027re talking just like a Dark One yourself. You love her! So don\u0027t demand or expect anything in return. That\u0027s the way of the Light!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Love begins where the Dark and the Light end.\u0027\\n\\n Tiger Cub was so indignant she couldn\u0027t even respond. She shook her head sadly and said reluctantly:\\n\\n \u0027You can at least promise . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That depends on what.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To be sensible. To trust your superiors.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I promise halfway.\u0027\\n\\n Tiger Cub sighed and then said confidingly:\\n\\n \u0027Listen, Anton, you probably think I don\u0027t understand you at all. But it\u0027s not true. I didn\u0027t want to be a shape-shifting magician. I had healing powers, and pretty serious ones.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027 I looked at her in amazement. I\u0027d never have thought it.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I did. But when I had to choose which side of my powers to develop, the boss called me in. We sat and talked over tea. We talked very seriously, like adults, although I was only a little girl, younger than Yulia is now. About what the Light needed and who the Watch needed, what I could achieve. And we decided that I should develop my combat powers, even at the expense of everything else. I didn\u0027t much like the idea at first. Do you know how painful it is when you change?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Into a tiger?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, changing into a tiger\u0027s okay, the hard part\u0027s changing back. But I stuck with it. Because I believed the boss, because I realised it was the right thing to do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now I\u0027m happy,\u0027 the young woman declared passionately. \u0027When I see what I would have lost, what I would have been doing with my time. Herbs and spells, fiddling with distorted psychic fields, neutralising black vortices, mixing up charms . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Blood, pain, fear, death,\u0027 I said in the same tone. \u0027Doing battle on two or three levels of reality simultaneously. Dodging the fire, tasting the blood, going through hell and high water.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s war.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, probably. But why do you have to be the one in the front line?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someone has to, don\u0027t they? And then, after all, I wouldn\u0027t have had a house like this.\u0027 Tiger Cub waved her hand round the room. \u0027You know yourself you don\u0027t earn much from healing. If you heal with all your power, it just means someone else keeps killing people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is a nice place,\u0027 I agreed. \u0027But how often are you here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whenever I can be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess that\u0027s not very often. You take shift after shift, you\u0027re always where the action\u0027s hottest.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s my path.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded. What business was it of mine? I said:\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right. I suppose I must be tired. That\u0027s why I\u0027m talking such rubbish.\u0027\\n\\n Tiger Cub looked at me suspiciously, surprised I\u0027d given in so quickly.\\n\\n \u0027I need to sit here with my glass for a while,\u0027 I added. \u0027Get completey drunk all on my own, fall asleep under the table and wake up with a splitting headache. Then I\u0027ll feel better.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on, then,\u0027 the sorceress said, with a slight note of nervousness in her voice. \u0027What did we come here for? The bar\u0027s open, you can have whatever you like. We can go and join the others. Or I could stay and keep you company.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027ll be better off on my own,\u0027 I said, slapping my hand against the pot-bellied bottle. \u0027In absolute misery, with no food to go with the drink and no company. Look in before you go for a swim. Just in case I\u0027m still capable of moving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n She smiled and went out. I was left all alone – unless the bottle of Armenian cognac counted as company. Sometimes it helps to believe it does.\\n\\n She was a fine girl. They were all fine and wonderful, my friends and colleagues at the Watch. I could hear their voices through the Queen song, and I liked that. I got on really well with some of them and not so well with others. But I had no enemies here and I never would have. We were a close team, and there was only one way we could ever lose each other. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-56.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
