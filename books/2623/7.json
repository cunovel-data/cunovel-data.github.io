People gave it to help someone.\u0027 Kostya suddenly laughed. He reached out, took one of the bottles and opened it, tearing off the tinfoil cap with practised ease. He raised the bottle to his lips, laughed again and took a swallow. I\u0027d never seen them feed. And never really wanted to. \u0027Stop that,\u0027 I said. \u0027Don\u0027t play the fool.\u0027 Kostya\u0027s lips were covered in blood and there was a fine trickle of it running down his neck. Not just running down, but soaking into the skin. \u0027Do you find the way we feed ourselves unpleasant?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027So you find me unpleasant as well? All of us?\u0027 I shook my head. We\u0027d never talked about this before. It had been easier that way. \u0027Kostya, in order to live, you need blood. And, sometimes at least, human blood.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t live.\u0027 \u0027I meant in the more general sense. In order to move, think, speak, dream.\u0027 \u0027What do you care about a vampire\u0027s dreams?\u0027 \u0027Listen, son. There are plenty of people living in the world who need regular blood transfusions. There are at least as many of them as you. And then there are hospital emergencies. That\u0027s why people give blood, that\u0027s why it\u0027s thought to be such an honourable and respected thing to do ... I know about your kind\u0027s contributions to the development of medicine and the way you promoted the giving of blood. Kostya, if someone needs blood in order to live, to exist – that\u0027s no big deal. And whether it goes in through the veins or the stomach is irrelevant too. The important thing is how you get hold of it.\u0027 \u0027Empty words,\u0027 Kostya snorted. I got the feeling he\u0027d crossed over into the Twilight for an instant and then come straight back out. The boy was growing up, all right. And he was getting really strong. \u0027You showed the way you really feel about us yesterday.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re wrong.\u0027 \u0027Ah, drop it . . .\u0027 He put the bottle down, then changed his mind and turned it upside down over the sink. \u0027We don\u0027t need your—\u0027 I heard a hoot behind me and swung round. I\u0027d completely forgotten about the owl, but now it had turned its head towards Kostya and spread its wings. \u0027Agh . . .\u0027 he said. \u0027What . . .\u0027 The owl folded its wings and closed its eyes. \u0027Olga, we\u0027re talking,\u0027 I growled. \u0027Just give us a moment . . .\u0027 The bird didn\u0027t respond. Kostya glanced from me to the owl and back again. Then he sat down and folded his hands on his knees. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Can I go now?\u0027 He wasn\u0027t just surprised or frightened, he was in shock. \u0027Okay. But take this, will you?\u0027 Kostya began grabbing the bottles and putting them in his pockets. \u0027Take a plastic bag, you dunce! What if there\u0027s someone in the hallway?\u0027 The vampire obediently packed all the bottles into a plastic bag bearing the noble inscription: \u0027For the resurrection of Russian culture!\u0027 He gave the owl a sideways glance, went out into the hall and hastily began putting on his shoes. \u0027Call again,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m not your enemy. Not until you cross that line, I\u0027m not.\u0027 He nodded and shot out of my apartment like a bullet. I shrugged and closed the door, then went back into the kitchen and looked at the owl. \u0027Well? What happened there?\u0027 It was impossible to read anything in those amber-yellow eyes. I threw my hands up. \u0027How can we work together? Eh? How are we going to collaborate? Do you have any way of communicating? I\u0027m trying to be frank with you, do you hear me? To have a frank conversation!\u0027 I didn\u0027t go all the way into the Twilight, just reached in there with my thoughts. It\u0027s not good to trust anyone you don\u0027t know like that, but the boss wouldn\u0027t have given me a partner I couldn\u0027t trust, would he? No answer. Even if Olga could communicate telepathically, she wasn\u0027t going to. \u0027What shall we do? We need to look for that girl. Will you accept her image?\u0027 No reply. I sighed and tossed the scrap of my memory at the bird anyway. The owl stretched its wings and soared across on to my shoulder. \u0027Ah, so we do hear when we\u0027re spoken to? But we don\u0027t condescend to reply. All right, have it your own way. What should I do?\u0027 The owl still wouldn\u0027t speak. In fact, I knew what to do. There was no hope of success, but that was a different matter. \u0027And how am I going to wander round the streets with you sitting on my shoulder?\u0027 A mocking glance, definitely mocking. And the bird on my shoulder shifted into the Twilight. So that was it. An invisible observer. And no ordinary observer – Kostya\u0027s reaction to the owl had been very instructive. Apparently I\u0027d been given a partner that the powers of the Dark knew better than the rank-and-file servants of the Light did. \u0027Right,\u0027 I said cheerfully. \u0027I\u0027ll just grab a bite to eat, okay?\u0027 I took out some yoghurt and poured a glass of orange juice. The very thought of what I\u0027d been feeding myself with for the last week – half-raw steaks and meat juices that were not much different from blood – made me feel sick. \u0027Maybe you\u0027d like a bit of meat?\u0027 The owl turned away. \u0027Have it your own way,\u0027 I said. \u0027No doubt when you get hungry you\u0027ll find some way to communicate.\u0027 CHAPTER 3 I LIKE WALKING round town inside the Twilight. You don\u0027t actually become invisible, or you\u0027d have people bumping into you all the time. They just somehow look straight through you and don\u0027t notice you. But this time I\u0027d have to work out in the open. The day\u0027s not our time. Odd as it may seem, the followers of the Light work at night, when the Dark Ones become active. And just at the moment there wasn\u0027t so much the Dark Ones could do. During the day vampires, werewolves and Dark Magicians are obliged to live like ordinary people. Most of them, that is. I was walking round Tulskaya metro station. Following the boss\u0027s advice, I\u0027d worked through all the stations on the circle line where the girl with the black vortex could possibly have left the metro. She should have left a trail behind, a weak one maybe, but still detectable. Now I\u0027d decided to work my way out along the radial lines. It\u0027s a stupid station in a stupid district. Two exits quite some distance apart. A market, that pompous-looking skyscraper occupied by the tax police, a massive apartment block. With all those dark emanations all around, any chance of picking up the trail of the black vortex was looking pretty doubtful. Especially if it had never even been there. I walked round everything, trying to sense the girl\u0027s aura, sometimes glancing into the Twilight at the invisible bird nesting on my shoulder. The own was dozing. It couldn\u0027t sense anything either, and for some reason I felt sure its reconnaissance skills were better than mine. Once a militiaman checked my papers. Twice I was pestered by crazy blokes who wanted to give me, absolutely free – that is for only fifty roubles – a Chinese fan, a child\u0027s toy and a dirt-cheap Korean mobile phone. And again I couldn\u0027t control myself. I brushed aside the next street salesman who pestered me and performed a remoralisation. Only a little one, right at the very edge of what\u0027s allowed. Maybe he would start looking for a different kind of work. Or maybe he wouldn\u0027t. . . But just at that moment someone grabbed hold of my elbows. A second earlier there was no one there – then suddenly there was a young couple. An attractive-looking girl with red hair and a solid-looking man with a surly expression on his face. \u0027Stop there,\u0027 said the girl. She was the leader, I could tell that straight off. \u0027Day Watch.\u0027 Light and Dark! I shrugged and looked at them. \u0027Your name,\u0027 the girl demanded. There was no point in lying, they\u0027d captured the image of my aura already, and after that identifying the individual is only a matter of time. \u0027Anton Gorodetsky.\u0027 They waited. \u0027Other,\u0027 I confessed. \u0027Night Watch agent.\u0027 They lifted their hands off my elbows, and even took a step back. But they didn\u0027t seem disappointed. \u0027Okay, let\u0027s enter the Twilight,\u0027 said the man. They didn\u0027t look like vampires. That was one good thing. At least I could hope for a certain degree of objectivity. I sighed and shifted from one reality into the other. The first surprise was that they turned out to be genuinely young. A witch of about twenty-five and a warlock of about thirty, the same age as me. I thought that if I needed to, I could probably even recall their names, there weren\u0027t that many witches and warlocks born in the late 1960s. The second surprise was that the owl wasn\u0027t there on my shoulder. Or rather, it was: I could feel its claws and I could see it, but only with some effort. It was as if the bird had shifted realities at the same time as I had and moved into a deeper level of the Twilight. This was getting really interesting! \u0027Day Watch,\u0027 the girl repeated. \u0027Alisa Donnikova, Other.\u0027 \u0027Pyotr Nesterov, Other,\u0027 the man muttered. \u0027You have some kind of problem?\u0027 The girl drilled me with one of those speciality \u0027witch\u0027s glances\u0027. She started to look more attractive and appealing with every moment. Of course, I\u0027m protected against direct influence, it\u0027s not possible to bewitch me, but it certainly looked impressive. \u0027We\u0027re not the ones with the problem. Anton Gorodetsky, you have entered into unsanctioned contact with a human.\u0027 \u0027Yes? And what was that?\u0027 \u0027Only a seventh-degree intervention,\u0027 the witch admitted reluctantly. \u0027But an offence is an offence. And you also urged him towards the Light.\u0027 \u0027Are we going to draw up a charge report?\u0027 I suddenly found the situation amusing. Seventh degree was next to nothing – a level of influence on the borderline between magic and ordinary conversation. \u0027We are.\u0027 \u0027And what are we going to write? A Night Watch agent slightly increased one human\u0027s aversion to deception?\u0027 \u0027Thereby disrupting the established balance,\u0027 the warlock barked out. \u0027Really? And what harm does it do to the Dark? If the guy stops working as a petty crook, his life is bound to get worse. He\u0027ll be more moral, but unhappier too. Under the terms of the commentaries on the Treaty on the balance of power, that\u0027s not regarded as a violation of the balance.\u0027 \u0027Sophistry,\u0027 the young woman said curtly. \u0027You\u0027re a Night Watch agent. What might be pardonable for an ordinary Other is not acceptable from you.\u0027 She was right. It was still a violation, even if it was petty. \u0027He was obstructing me. I have a right to use magical intervention in the course of conducting an investigation.\u0027 \u0027Are you on duty, Anton?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Why during the day?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-7.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
