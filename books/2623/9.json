{"id":101327,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":". . . Perovo. A large city district. Crowds of people. Light and Dark, all twisted up together into a knot. And a few institutions, casting beams of Dark and Light in all directions. Working there would be like trying to find a grain of sand on the floor of a crowded disco with the strobe lights on.\n I wouldn\u0027t be much use to anyone, or rather, I wouldn\u0027t be any use at all. But I\u0027d been ordered to go, so I had to. Maybe they\u0027d ask me to identify the girl.\n \u0027For some reason I was sure we\u0027d get lucky,\u0027 I whispered, gazing at the road ahead. We drove past Elk Island Park, a pretty grim place where the Dark Ones gather for their sabbaths. And when they do, the rights of ordinary people aren\u0027t always respected. Five nights a year we have to put up with anything. Well, almost anything.\n \u0027I thought so too,\u0027 whispered Olga.\n \u0027I can\u0027t compete with the field agents,\u0027 I said, shaking my head.\n The driver glanced sideways at me. I\u0027d accepted the price without haggling, and he\u0027d seemed happy enough to go in my direction. But a man talking to himself always arouses suspicion.\n \u0027I just blew this job,\u0027 I told the driver with a sigh. \u0027That is, I made a mess of it. I thought I could make up for it today, but they managed without me.\u0027\n \u0027So what\u0027s your hurry?\u0027 the driver asked. He didn\u0027t look like the talkative type, but he was interested.\n \u0027I was ordered to go,\u0027 I said.\n I wondered who he thought I was.\n \u0027So what do you do?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m a programmer,\u0027 I answered. And I was telling the truth too.\n \u0027Fantastic,\u0027 the driver commented, and laughed. What was so fantastic about it? \u0027Do you make a living?\u0027\n He didn\u0027t really have to ask. After all, I wasn\u0027t riding the metro. But I answered anyway:\n \u0027Enough.\u0027\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t just asking out of curiosity,\u0027 my driver unexpectedly confided. \u0027My system administrator\u0027s leaving me . . .\u0027\n My system administrator . . . Well, well!\n \u0027I personally see the finger of fate in this. I give a man a lift and he turns out to be a programmer. I think you\u0027re already doomed.\u0027\n He laughed, like he was trying to make light of his over-confidence.\n \u0027Have you worked with local networks?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027A network of fifty terminals. It has to be maintained. We pay well.\u0027\n I felt myself starting to smile. It was a good offer. A local network. Decent money. And no one sending you out at night to catch vampires, making you drink blood and sniff out trails on the frozen streets . . .\n \u0027Shall I give you my card?\u0027 The man slipped one hand into his jacket pocket. \u0027Think about it . . .\u0027\n \u0027No thanks. I\u0027m afraid no one just leaves my kind of work.\u0027\n \u0027KGB, is it?\u0027 the driver asked with a frown.\n \u0027More serious than that,\u0027 I answered. \u0027Much more serious. But something like that.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, well. . .\u0027 the driver said, and paused. \u0027A pity. And I thought it was a sign from on high. Do you believe in fate?\u0027\n He\u0027d slipped into a familiar tone quite naturally. I like that.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027 asked the driver, genuinely surprised, as if he\u0027d only ever met fatalists his whole life.\n \u0027There\u0027s no such thing as fate. It\u0027s been proved.\u0027\n \u0027Who by?\u0027\n \u0027In the place I work.\u0027\n He laughed.\n \u0027That\u0027s great. So it\u0027s not meant to be! Where shall I stop?\u0027\n We were already driving down Zelyony Avenue.\n I peered hard through the layer of ordinary daily reality, into the Twilight. I couldn\u0027t make anything out clearly, my powers weren\u0027t strong enough. I sensed it rather than saw it – a cluster of dim lights in the grey gloom. Almost the entire central office was there.\n \u0027Over there . . .\u0027\n While I was still in ordinary reality I couldn\u0027t see my colleagues. I walked over the murky city snow towards the little square buried under snowdrifts between the apartment blocks and the avenue. A few frozen trees, a few lines of footsteps – either kids had been having fun, or a drunk had just staggered across.\n \u0027Wave to them, they\u0027ve spotted you,\u0027 Olga suggested.\n I thought for a moment and followed her advice. Let them think I could see clearly from one reality into the other.\n \u0027A meeting,\u0027 Olga said mockingly. \u0027An emergency briefing.\u0027\n I glanced round, just for form\u0027s sake, then summoned the Twilight and stepped into it.\n The entire central office really was there. The whole of the Moscow department.\n Standing in the middle was Boris Ignatievich. Lightly dressed in a suit and a thin fur cap, but wearing a scarf for some reason. I could just imagine him scrambling out of his BMW, surrounded by his bodyguards.\n The field operatives were standing beside him. Igor and Garik – they were the ones really suited to the role of front-line fighters. Thick-set, stony faces, square shoulders, dull eyes – impervious. You can tell at a glance what kind of education they\u0027ve had: eight years of secondary school, technical college and the special forces. And as far as Igor\u0027s concerned that\u0027s exactly right. But Garik has two full college degrees. The appearance is similar, the behaviour almost identical, but the content\u0027s completely different. By comparison, Ilya looks like some refined intellectual, but it would be a mistake to be misled by those round spectacles with the thin frames, that high forehead and naïve expression. Semyon\u0027s was another exaggerated character: short, stocky, with a cunning gleam in his eyes, wearing a cheap nylon baseball jacket. A provincial, come up to the big city, from somewhere straight out of the 1960s, from the prize-winning collective farm Lenin\u0027s Stride. Absolute opposites. But what Ilya and Semyon had in common was a beautiful tan and dejected expressions. They\u0027d been pulled out of Sir Lanka mid-holiday, and they weren\u0027t enjoying the Moscow winter too much. Ignat, Danila and Farid weren\u0027t there, although I could sense their fresh trails. But standing right behind the boss, not exactly like they were trying to hide, but not really noticeable unless you looked hard, were Bear and Tiger Cub. I was taken aback to see those two. They\u0027re not ordinary front-line fighters, they\u0027re really good, and they don\u0027t let minor details stand in their way.\n There were lots of people from the office there too.\n The analytical section, all five of them. The research team – everyone except Yulia, but that wasn\u0027t surprising, she\u0027s only thirteen. The only ones missing were from the archives section.\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 I said.\n Some nodded, some smiled. But I could see they all had more important things than me on their minds. Boris Ignatievich gestured for me to come closer and then carried on from where he\u0027d got to before I turned up and interrupted him:\n \u0027Not in their interest, and we welcome that. We won\u0027t get any help from them . . . well, fine, that\u0027s just great . . .\u0027\n Clear enough. He meant the Day Watch.\n \u0027We can search for the girl without interference, and Danila and Farid are already getting close. I\u0027d say, another five or six minutes . . . But we\u0027ve still been given an ultimatum.\u0027\n I caught Tiger Cub\u0027s eye. Oh, that was her ominous smile. That\u0027s right, her smile. Tiger Cub\u0027s a woman, but there was no way \u0027Tigress\u0027 would have stuck.\n Our agents don\u0027t much like the word \u0027ultimatum\u0027.\n \u0027We don\u0027t get to hold on to the Dark Magician,\u0027 the boss said, looking round at everyone with a dissatisfied expression. \u0027Got that? We\u0027ll have to find him in order to disarm the vortex. But after that we hand the magician over to the Dark Ones.\u0027\n \u0027We hand him over?\u0027 Ilya queried.\n The boss thought for a second.\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s a fair point. We don\u0027t eliminate him and we don\u0027t prevent him from contacting the Dark Ones. As far as I\u0027ve been able to tell, they don\u0027t know who he is either.\u0027\n The operatives\u0027 faces were turning sourer by the moment. Any new magician on the territory they monitored was a big headache. Even if he was registered and observed the terms of the Treaty. But a magician this powerful . . .\n \u0027I\u0027d prefer a slightly different scenario,\u0027 Tiger Cub said quietly. \u0027Boris Ignatievich, in the course of our work, situations can crop up over which we have no control. . .\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but we can\u0027t allow such situations to arise,\u0027 the boss snapped. Tiger Cub backed off immediately.\n I\u0027d have done the same.\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s about it. . .\u0027 The boss glanced at me. \u0027I\u0027m glad you got here, Anton. There\u0027s something I especially wanted you to hear.\u0027\n I automatically tensed up.\n \u0027You did a good job yesterday. Yes, it\u0027s true, the only reason I sent you out to look for the vampires was to test you. And not just to see how good an operative you are, either . . . you\u0027ve been in a difficult situation for a long time, Anton. Killing a vampire is a lot harder for you than for anyone else here.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just where you\u0027re wrong, boss,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027I\u0027d be glad if I\u0027m mistaken. I want to thank you on behalf of the entire Night Watch. You destroyed one vampire and captured the image of the female vampire\u0027s trail. Captured it very accurately. You still don\u0027t have enough experience for investigative work. But you know how to record information clearly. The same thing goes for this girl. It was a completely non-standard situation, but you made a humane decision . . . and that\u0027s won us some time. The image of her aura was excellent. I knew immediately where to look for her.\u0027\n That really stung. No one was smiling or laughing, no one was smirking at me, but I still felt humiliated. The owl, whom nobody had seen yet, twitched on my shoulder. I took a deep breath of the Twilight air, that cold, tasteless air that isn\u0027t air at all. I asked:\n \u0027Boris Ignatievich, then what was the reason for sending me round the circle line? If you already knew the right district.\u0027\n \u0027I could have been wrong,\u0027 the boss replied, a note of surprise in his voice. \u0027That\u0027s another thing . . . you have to understand that when you\u0027re working out in the field, you can\u0027t afford to rely on any opinion, no matter from how high up. One man in the field is a warrior – if he knows he\u0027s alone.\u0027\n \u0027But I wasn\u0027t alone,\u0027 I said. \u0027And this assignment is absolutely crucial for my partner, you know that better than I do. By sending us to check districts you knew were empty, you deprived her of a chance to redeem herself.\u0027\n The boss\u0027s face is made of stone, you can\u0027t read anything in it if he doesn\u0027t want you to.\n But even so, I felt like I\u0027d hit the target.\n \u0027Your assignment isn\u0027t over yet, Anton and Olga,\u0027 he replied. \u0027There\u0027s still the female vampire, who has to be neutralised. No one has any right to interfere with us there: she violated the terms of the Treaty. And there\u0027s still the boy who showed such exceptional resistance to magic. He has to be found and turned to the Light. Plenty to be getting on with.\u0027\n \u0027And this girl?\u0027\n \u0027Already detected. The specialists will now try to neutralise the vortex. If that doesn\u0027t work, which it won\u0027t, we\u0027ll have to figure out who cast the curse. Ignat, over to you.\u0027\n I turned round. There indeed was Ignat standing not far away. Tall, well built and handsome, with blond hair, the figure of Apollo and the face of a movie star. He moved soundlessly, but even so in ordinary reality he couldn\u0027t avoid attention from women.\n Real attention.\n \u0027That\u0027s not my way of working,\u0027 Ignat said glumly. \u0027Not an MO I\u0027m particularly fond of.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-9.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
