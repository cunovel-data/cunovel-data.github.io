{"id":101357,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"\u0027I knew I\u0027d find you here,\u0027 said Zabulon.\\n\\n He was looking at me. And only at me.\\n\\n \u0027How stupid,\u0027 he said, shaking his head. \u0027What do you need all this for, eh?\u0027\\n\\n He took a step forward and Alisa darted out of his way.\\n\\n \u0027A good job, prosperity, self-esteem, all the joys of the world – all in your grasp, all you have to do is decide what you\u0027ll have this time. But you\u0027re so stubborn. I don\u0027t understand you, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I don\u0027t understand you, Zabulon,\u0027 said the boss, blocking his way.\\n\\n The Dark Magician reluctantly redirected his gaze.\\n\\n \u0027Then you must be getting old. The person in your lover\u0027s body is Anton Gorodetsky, the same person we suspect of the serial killings of Dark Ones. Just how long has he been hiding in there, Boris? Didn\u0027t you notice the substitution?\u0027\\n\\n He laughed.\\n\\n I looked round at the Dark Ones. They still hadn\u0027t understood. They needed another second, or half a second.\\n\\n Then I saw Svetlana raise her hand, with a yellow magical flame flickering in her palm.\\n\\n So now she\u0027d passed the fifth-grade test – but this was still a battle we could only lose. There were three of us and six of them. If Svetlana struck – not to save herself, but to get me out of this fix – there\u0027d be a bloodbath.\\n\\n I leapt forward.\\n\\n It was a good thing Olga\u0027s body was well trained and in such good shape. It was a good thing that all of us – Light Ones and Dark Ones – weren\u0027t really used to relying on the strength of our arms and legs, on simple, crude violence. And the best thing of all was that Olga, who had been deprived of most of her magic, hadn\u0027t neglected the skills of physical combat.\\n\\n Zabulon doubled up with a hoarse gasp when my fist – or rather, Olga\u0027s – sank into his stomach. I swept his legs from under him with a single kick and ran outside.\\n\\n \u0027Stop!\u0027 howled Alisa in a voice filled with admiration, loathing and love all at once.\\n\\n The hunt was on.\\n\\n I ran down Pokrovka Street in the direction of Zemlyanoi Val Street, with my handbag bouncing hard against my back. It was a good thing I wasn\u0027t wearing high heels. I had to get away, to disappear. I\u0027d really enjoyed the urban survival course, but it was so short – who could have imagined a Night Watch agent would end up running and hiding, instead of chasing and catching?\\n\\n I heard a screeching wail behind me.\\n\\n I leapt aside in a pure reflex response, before I could even understand what was happening. A streak of crimson flame came hurtling down the street, coiling and twisting as it passed me, then it tried to stop and turn back, but its inertia was too great: the charge crashed into the wall of a building, momentarily turning the stones white hot.\\n\\n I tripped and fell, glancing back. Zabulon was recharging his battle staff, but he was moving very slowly, as if there were something hindering him, slowing him down.\\n\\n He was shooting to kill.\\n\\n There wouldn\u0027t have been even a handful of dust left if I\u0027d been caught by Shahab\u0027s Lash.\\n\\n So the boss was wrong after all. The Day Watch didn\u0027t want what was inside my head. They wanted to eliminate me completely.\\n\\n The Dark Ones were chasing after me. Zabulon was aiming his staff. The boss was restraining Svetlana as she struggled to break free. I got to my feet and started running again, already knowing there was no way I could escape. At least there was nobody around: instinctive, subconscious fear had swept everybody off the street the moment our confrontation began. Nobody else would get hurt.\\n\\n I heard a squeal of brakes and looked round just in time to see the Day Watch agents jump out of the way of a car careering wildly along the street. The driver stopped for a moment, evidently thinking he\u0027d driven into the middle of a gangland shootout, then picked up speed again.\\n\\n Should I stop him? No, it wasn\u0027t allowed.\\n\\n I jumped on to the pavement and squatted down, hiding from Zabulon behind an old Volga, letting the stray driver pass. The silver Toyota hurtled past me and then screeched to a halt with a smell of burning brakes.\\n\\n The door on the driver\u0027s side opened and a hand beckoned to me.\\n\\n Things like this just don\u0027t happen!\\n\\n Heroes only get rescued by passing cars in cheap action movies.\\n\\n At least that\u0027s what I was thinking as I opened the back door and jumped in.\\n\\n \u0027Get us out of here!\u0027 cried the woman sitting next to me. But the driver didn\u0027t need any encouragement, we were already moving. There was a flash behind us and the driver swerved out of the path of a streak of fire. The woman began wailing.\\n\\n How did they see what was happening? As automatic gunfire? Salvos of rockets? A blast from a flame-thrower?\\n\\n \u0027Why did you come back, why?\u0027 the woman asked, trying to lean forward to hit the driver in the back. I was all set to grab her arm, but before I could the car jerked forward and tossed the woman back against the seat.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t,\u0027 I said gently.\\n\\n She glared at me indignantly. She had every right. What woman would be pleased to see her husband stop and risk his life for an attractive, dishevelled female stranger and take her into his car when it\u0027s being chased by a gang of armed bandits?\\n\\n At least the immediate danger was past now. We came out on to Zemlyanoi Val Street and drove on in a solid stream of traffic. My friends and my enemies were both left a long way behind.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 I said to the short hair on the back of the driver\u0027s head.\\n\\n \u0027Did you get hit?\u0027 he asked without even turning round.\\n\\n \u0027No, thanks to you. Why did you stop?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because he\u0027s a dumb fool!\u0027 the woman beside me yelled. She moved away to the far side of the car, shunning me as if I had the plague.\\n\\n \u0027Because I\u0027m not a jerk,\u0027 the man replied calmly. \u0027Why were they out to get you? Never mind, it\u0027s none of my business.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They wanted to rape me,\u0027 I said, blurting out the first thing that came into my head. But it was a pretty good cover.\\n\\n \u0027Where do you want to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This will do fine,\u0027 I said, looking out at the flaming red letter M above the metro entrance. \u0027I\u0027ll make my own way home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can drop you off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No need. Thanks, you\u0027ve already done more than enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t argue or try to change my mind. The car braked and I got out. I looked at the woman.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n She snorted and jerked away, slamming the door shut.\\n\\n Well, there you go.\\n\\n But things like that still went to prove our work did make some kind of sense, after all, I thought.\\n\\n I automatically tidied my hair and dusted down my jeans. People walking by eyed me cautiously, but they didn\u0027t shy away, so I couldn\u0027t be looking all that bad.\\n\\n How much time did I have before the hunt picked up my trail? Would the boss be able to slow them down?\\n\\n That would be good. Because I thought I was beginning to understand what was going on here.\\n\\n And I had a chance, only a tiny one maybe, but still a chance.\\n\\n I set off towards the metro, taking the cell phone out of Olga\u0027s bag on the way. I started dialling her number, then swore and dialled my own.\\n\\n It rang five times, six, seven.\\n\\n I ended the call and dialled my own mobile number. This time Olga answered straight away.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 said a slightly hoarse, unfamiliar voice. My voice.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s me – Anton,\u0027 I shouted. A man walking past looked at me in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027You idiot!\u0027\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t have expected anything else from Olga.\\n\\n \u0027Where are you, Anton?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Getting ready to go underground.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll have plenty of time for that. What can I do to help?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you up to speed on the situation?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I\u0027m in parallel contact with Boris.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need to get my body back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where can we meet?\u0027\\n\\n I thought for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027The station where I got off after I tried to remove that black vortex from Svetlana.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure. Boris told me where. Make it three stations further round the circle line, up and to the left.\u0027\\n\\n She was counting off stations on the plan of the metro.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s okay.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the centre of the hall. I\u0027ll be there in twenty minutes. Want me to bring you anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just bring me. Anything else is up to you.\u0027\\n\\n I folded away the phone, shot another look around and walked quickly into the station.\\n\\n CHAPTER 4\\n\\n I WAS STANDING in the centre of Novoslobodskaya station. It\u0027s a common enough sight there when it\u0027s not really late yet: a girl waiting, maybe for a bloke, maybe for a girlfriend.\\n\\n In my case, I was waiting for both.\\n\\n It would be harder to find me underground than on the surface. Even the cleverest of the Dark Magicians wouldn\u0027t be able to pick up my aura through the layers of earth, through all the ancient graves that Moscow stood on, among the crowd, in that dense, agitated stream of people. Of course, combing all the stations wouldn\u0027t be too hard either: just one Other with my image for each station would do it.\\n\\n But I was hoping I still had an hour or at least half an hour before the Day Watch made that move.\\n\\n How simple everything was, after all. How elegantly the pieces of the puzzle fitted together. I shook my head and smiled, and immediately caught the eye of a young guy dressed in punk style looking at me inquisitively. No, my friend, you\u0027re on the wrong track. This woman is only smiling at her own thoughts.\\n\\n I ought to have got the picture the moment the plotlines all started converging on me. The boss was right, of course. I wasn\u0027t valuable enough. They wouldn\u0027t have come up with a risky and costly manoeuvre lasting years just for me. It was all about something else, something completely different.\\n\\n They were trying to exploit our weaknesses. Our goodness and love. And it was working, or almost working.\\n\\n I suddenly felt like I needed a cigarette really badly, my mouth even filled with saliva. Strange, I\u0027d never really smoked much, it had to be a reaction from Olga\u0027s body. I imagined her a hundred years earlier – an elegant woman with a slim cigarette in a long holder, sitting in some literary salon somewhere with Alexander Blok or Gumilev. Smiling as she discussed the Freemasons, the sovereignty of the people and mankind\u0027s urge towards spiritual perfection.\\n\\n Ah, here was someone at last!\\n\\n \u0027Have you got a cigarette?\u0027 I asked a young man walking past – he was dressed well enough not to smoke cheap shit like Golden Yava.\\n\\n He gave me a surprised look, then held out a pack of Parliaments.\\n\\n I took one, thanked him with a smile and cast a mild spell over myself. People\u0027s eyes slid off to the side.\\n\\n That was better. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-40.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
