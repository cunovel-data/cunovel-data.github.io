Her eyes seemed to be drilling right through Natasha. \u0027Simple, ancient female magic. With all your ambitions, you\u0027ve completely forgotten about it, and that\u0027s a mistake. But never mind. I\u0027ll help you. Only we\u0027ll have to do everything in three stages.\u0027\n She knocked gently on the table.\n \u0027The first thing ... I\u0027ll give you a love potion. This is not a great sin . . . The potion will bring your man back home. It will bring him back, but it won\u0027t keep him there.\u0027\n Natasha nodded uncertainly. The idea of dividing the spell into \u0027three stages\u0027 seemed inappropriate somehow – especially coming from this woman in this apartment . . .\n \u0027The second thing . . .Your rival\u0027s child must never be born. If it is, you won\u0027t be able to keep your man. So you\u0027ll have to commit a great sin, destroy an innocent child in the womb . . .\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 Natasha said, shuddering. \u0027I\u0027m not going to end up in court!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not talking about poison, Natashenka. I\u0027ll make a pass with my hands\u0027 – and the seer did just that with her open palms – \u0027and then clap them . . . And the job\u0027s done, the sin\u0027s committed. No courts involved.\u0027\n Natasha said nothing.\n \u0027Only I won\u0027t take that sin on myself,\u0027 said Darya, crossing herself hurriedly. \u0027I\u0027ll help you if you like, but then you\u0027ll have to answer to God!\u0027\n Evidently taking silence as consent, she continued:\n \u0027The third thing . . .You\u0027ll have a child yourself. I\u0027ll help with that too. You\u0027ll have a beautiful, clever daughter who\u0027ll be a support to you and a joy to your husband. Then all your troubles will be over.\u0027\n \u0027Are you serious about all this?\u0027 Natasha asked in a quiet voice. \u0027You can really do all this . . . ?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell you how it is,\u0027 said Darya, standing up. \u0027You say \"yes\", and it will all happen. Your husband will come back tomorrow and the day after tomorrow your rival will miscarry. And I won\u0027t take any money from you until you get pregnant. But afterwards I will – and I\u0027ll take a lot, I tell you that now, I swear by Christ the Lord.\u0027\n Natasha gave a crooked smile.\n \u0027And what if I cheat you and don\u0027t bring you the money? After everything\u0027s already happened . . .\u0027\n She stopped short. The seer was looking at her sternly, saying nothing. With an air of gentle sympathy, like a mother looking at a foolish daughter . . .\n \u0027You won\u0027t cheat me, Natashenka. Just think about it for a moment and you\u0027ll realise it\u0027s not even worth trying.\u0027\n Natasha swallowed hard. She tried to make a joke of it:\n \u0027So it\u0027s cash on delivery?\u0027\n \u0027Ah, my little businesswoman,\u0027 Darya said ironically. \u0027Who\u0027s going to love you, so practical and clever? A woman should always have some foolishness in her . . . Ah, yes . . . cash on delivery. Delivery of all three items.\u0027\n \u0027How much?\u0027\n \u0027Five.\u0027\n \u0027You want five?\u0027 Natasha burst out and broke off. \u0027I thought it was going to be a lot less than that.\u0027\n \u0027If you just want to get your husband back, that will be cheaper. Only then, after a while, he\u0027ll go away again. But I\u0027m offering you real help, a certain cure.\u0027\n \u0027I want to do it,\u0027 Natasha said with a nod. What was happening felt slightly unreal. So that was all there was to it, just a clap of the hands – and the unborn child would disappear? Another clap – and she would bear her beloved idiot husband a child of her own?\n \u0027Do you take the sin upon yourself?\u0027 the seer asked insistently.\n \u0027What sin is there in that?\u0027 Natasha retorted, her irritation suddenly breaking through. \u0027Every woman\u0027s committed that sin at least once! And perhaps there isn\u0027t anything there anyway!\u0027\n The seer pondered, as if listening to something. She nodded her head.\n \u0027There is . . . And I think it\u0027s definitely a daughter.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll take it,\u0027 said Natasha, still irritated. \u0027I\u0027ll take all the sins on myself, any you like. Do we have a deal?\u0027\n The seer looked at her sternly, disapprovingly: \u0027That\u0027s not right, my daughter . . . All the sins. Who knows what sins I might decide to hand over to you? My own, somebody else\u0027s . . . and then you would have to answer to God.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027d sort it out somehow.\u0027\n Darya sighed:\n \u0027Oh, these young people are so foolish. Do you think He wastes his time rummaging about in people\u0027s sins? Every sin leaves its own trace, and the judgement fits the trace . . . But all right, don\u0027t be afraid. I won\u0027t make you answerable for anybody else\u0027s sins.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not afraid.\u0027\n The seer didn\u0027t seem to be listening to her any more. She was sitting there as if she was listening alertly to something else. Then she shrugged:\n \u0027All right . . . let\u0027s get the job done. Give me your hand!\u0027\n Natasha held out her right hand uncertainly, keeping a worried eye on her diamond ring. It didn\u0027t come off her finger very easily, but . . .\n \u0027Oh!\u0027\n The seer had pricked her little finger so quickly and deftly that Natasha hadn\u0027t felt a thing. She froze, dumbfounded, watching the red drop welling up. As if this was all perfectly routine, Darya dropped the medical needle onto a dirty plate encrusted with old borscht. The needle was flat, with a sharp little point – the kind they use to take blood in laboratories.\n \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid, everything\u0027s sterile, the needles are disposable.\u0027\n \u0027What do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 Natasha tried to pull her hand away, but Darya shifted her grip with a surprisingly powerful and precise movement.\n \u0027Stop, you idiot! Or I\u0027ll have to prick you again!\u0027\n She took a small chemist\u0027s bottle of dark-brown glass out of her pocket. The label had been washed off, but poorly, the first letters were still visible: \u0027Tinc . . .\u0027. She deftly twisted out the cork, set the bottle down and shook Natasha\u0027s little finger over it. The drop of blood fell into the bottle.\n \u0027Some people believe,\u0027 the seer said contentedly, \u0027that the more blood there is in a potion, the stronger it will be. It\u0027s not true. The blood in it has to be good quality, but the quantity makes no difference at all . . .\u0027\n The medicine woman opened the fridge and took out a fifty-gram bottle of Privet vodka. Natasha remembered her driver calling that kind of vodka \u0027the reanimator\u0027.\n A few drops of the vodka went onto a wisp of cotton wool that was wound round Natasha\u0027s little finger. The medicine woman held the bottle out to Natasha.\n \u0027Want some?\u0027\n Natasha suddenly had a vivid vision of herself waking up the next morning – somewhere at the far end of the city, robbed, raped and not remembering a single thing about what had happened. She shook her head.\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ll have a drop.\u0027 Darya raised the \u0027reanimator\u0027 to her lips and drained the vodka in a single gulp. \u0027That\u0027s a bit easier . . . for working. And you, you\u0027ve no reason to be afraid of me. I don\u0027t make my living by robbing people.\u0027\n The last few remaining drops of vodka also went into the little brown bottle. And then, quite unperturbed by Natasha\u0027s curious gaze, the seer added salt, sugar, hot water from the kettle and a little powder with a strong smell of vanilla.\n \u0027What is that?\u0027 asked Natasha.\n \u0027Have you got a cold? It\u0027s vanilla.\u0027\n The medicine woman held the little bottle out to her.\n \u0027Take it.\u0027\n \u0027Is that all?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s it. You get your husband to drink it. Can you manage that? You can put it in tea, or even in vodka – but that\u0027s not the best way.\u0027\n \u0027But where\u0027s the . . . magic?\u0027\n \u0027The magic?\u0027\n Natasha felt like a fool again. Her voice almost broke into a shout as she said:\n \u0027This is a drop of my blood, a drop of vodka, sugar, salt and vanilla!\u0027\n \u0027And water,\u0027 Darya added. She put her hands on her hips and looked at Natasha ironically. \u0027What did you expect? Dried eye of toad? Oriole\u0027s testicles? Or for me to blow my nose into it? What do you want – ingredients or effect?\u0027\n Natasha didn\u0027t answer, overwhelmed. And Darya continued, no longer trying to conceal her mockery: \u0027My dear girl, if I\u0027d wanted to impress you, then I would have done. Have no doubt about it. What matters is not what\u0027s in the bottle, but who made it. Don\u0027t you worry, go home and give it to your husband. Will he be coming round again?\u0027\n \u0027Yes ... in the evening, he phoned to say he\u0027d come and collect a few things . . .\u0027 she mumbled.\n \u0027Let him collect them, only you give him some tea. Tomorrow he\u0027ll bring the things back again. That is, if you let him in, of course.\u0027 Darya laughed. \u0027All right then . . . There\u0027s one more thing we need to do. Do you take this sin on yourself?\u0027\n \u0027I do.\u0027 Natasha suddenly realised that she no longer felt entirely able to laugh at what she had said. There was something here that wasn\u0027t funny. The seer had made her promise far too seriously. And if her husband did come back tomorrow . . .\n \u0027Your word, my deed . . .\u0027 Darya slowly drew her hands apart and began speaking rapidly: \u0027Red water, others\u0027 grief and rotten seed and evil breed . . . What was is no more, what was not will not be . . . Return to the void, you are dissolved without trace, by my will, at my word . . .\u0027\n Her voice fell to an incoherent whisper. She continued to move her lips for a minute. Then she clapped her hands hard.\n It must have been a trick of the imagination but Natasha thought she felt a gust of icy-cold wind blow through the kitchen. Her heart started pounding, she felt a shiver run down her spine.\n Darya gave her head a shake, looked at Natasha and nodded:\n \u0027That\u0027s all. Go now, my dear. Go home, my daughter, and wait for your husband.\u0027\n Natasha got up. She asked:\n \u0027But what . . . when do I ... ?\u0027\n \u0027When you get pregnant, you\u0027ll remember about me yourself. I\u0027ll wait for three months . . . and then if I\u0027m still waiting – don\u0027t blame me . . .\u0027\n Natasha nodded. She swallowed hard to keep down the lump that had risen in her throat. Somehow she now believed utterly in everything the seer had promised . . . and at the same time, it was painfully clear to her that in three months\u0027 time, if everything really did work out, she would be reluctant to pay the woman. She would be tempted to put it all down to coincidence . . . why should she give this filthy charlatan five thousand dollars?\n And yet she realised that she would. She might drag it out until the very last day, but she would bring her the money.\n Because she would remember the clap of those unmanicured hands and that wave of cold that had suddenly spread through the kitchen.\n \u0027Go now,\u0027 the seer repeated with gentle insistence. \u0027I still have to cook supper and clean up the apartment. Go on, go on . . .\u0027\n Natasha went out into the dark hall, took off the slippers with a sigh of relief and put on her shoes. Her tights seemed to have survived the ordeal . . . that was certainly more than she\u0027d dared hope for . . .\n She looked back at the seer and tried to find the right words. Should she thank her, ask her about some detail, maybe even make a joke – if she could manage to, of course . . .\n But Darya had completely forgotten her. The seer\u0027s eyes were wide open and she was staring at the closed door, feebly waving her hands through the air in front of her as she whispered:\n \u0027Who . . . who . . . who?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-72.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
