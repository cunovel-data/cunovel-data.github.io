She had the most magnificent proof possible of the existence of \u0027black\u0027 magic hanging right there over her head, a textbook case.\\n\\n \u0027I could show you one,\u0027 I said. I remembered how they\u0027d brought Danila into the office one time. It was after an ordinary fight – not absolutely ordinary, but not so heavy either. He\u0027d just been unlucky. They were detaining a family of werewolves for some petty violation of the Treaty. The werewolves could have given themselves up and nothing more would have come of it than a brief joint investigation by the two Watches.\\n\\n But the werewolves decided to resist. They probably had an entire trail of bloody crimes behind them that the Night Watch knew nothing about – and now they never would. Danila went in first, and got badly mauled. His left lung, his heart, a deep trauma to the liver, one kidney torn right out.\\n\\n The boss fixed Danila up, with a helping hand from almost everyone in the Watch who had any strength right then. I was standing in the third circle, our job was not so much to provide the boss with energy as to cut out external influences. But sometimes I took a look at Danila. He kept sinking into the Twilight, either on his own or with the boss. Every time he surfaced into reality his wounds were smaller. It was impressive, but not really all that difficult, after all the wounds were still fresh and they weren\u0027t predestined. But I had no doubt that the boss could cure Svetlana\u0027s mother. Even if the line of her destiny broke off in the near future, even if she was definitely going to die. She could be cured. Death would simply be due to other causes . . .\\n\\n \u0027Anton, aren\u0027t you afraid to talk like that?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged. Svetlana sighed.\\n\\n \u0027If you give someone hope, you become responsible, Anton. I don\u0027t believe in miracles. But right now I just might. Doesn\u0027t that scare you?\u0027\\n\\n I looked into her eyes.\\n\\n \u0027No, Svetlana. There are lots of things that scare me. But different things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, the vortex is down by twenty centimetres. The boss says to tell you well done.\u0027\\n\\n There was something about her voice I didn\u0027t like. A conversation through the Twilight isn\u0027t like an ordinary one, you can sense emotion.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 I asked through the dead grey shroud.\\n\\n \u0027Keep going, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish I could feel so self-assured,\u0027 said Svetlana. She looked at the window: \u0027Did you hear that? A kind of rustling sound . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The wind,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027Or someone walking by.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Olga, tell me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, everything\u0027s fine with the vortex. It\u0027s slowly shrinking. You\u0027re increasing her internal resistance somehow. They calculate that by morning the vortex will I have shrunk to a theoretically safe size. Then I can get to work.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what\u0027s the problem? There is one, Olga, I can sense it!\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \u0027Olga, are we partners or not?\u0027\\n\\n That worked. I couldn\u0027t see the owl, but I knew her eyes had glinted and she\u0027d glanced towards the windows of our field headquarters. Into the faces of the boss and the observer from the Dark Ones.\\n\\n \u0027Anton, there\u0027s a problem with the boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With Egor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, what are you thinking about?\u0027 Svetlana asked. It was hard work holding simultaneous conversations in the real world and the Twilight one.\\n\\n \u0027Just wishing I could be in two places at the same time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, your mission is far more important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me, Olga.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand, Anton.\u0027 That was Svetlana again.\\n\\n \u0027You know, I\u0027ve just realised that a friend of mine is in trouble. Big trouble,\u0027 I said, looking into her eyes.\\n\\n \u0027The girl vampire. She\u0027s taken the boy.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t feel a thing . . . No emotions, no pity, no anger, no sadness. I just felt cold and empty inside.\\n\\n I must have been expecting it. I didn\u0027t know why, but I was.\\n\\n \u0027But Bear and Tiger Cub are there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It just happened.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what\u0027s happened to him?\u0027\\n\\n As long as she hadn\u0027t initiated him. Death, simple death. Eternal death was more terrible.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s alive. She\u0027s taken him as a hostage.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n That had never happened before. It had simply never happened. Taking hostages was a game humans played.\\n\\n \u0027The girl vampire\u0027s demanding negotiations. She wants a trial. . . she\u0027s hoping to find some way out.\u0027\\n\\n In my head I gave the vampire ten out of ten for inventiveness. She didn\u0027t have a chance of getting away and she\u0027d never had one. But if she could shift all the blame on to her eliminated friend, the one who\u0027d initiated her ... I don\u0027t know anything, I don\u0027t understand a thing. I just got bitten and turned into what I am. I didn\u0027t know the rules. I hadn\u0027t read the Treaty. I\u0027ll be a normal, law-abiding vampire . . .\\n\\n It might even work! I thought. Especially if the Night Watch made a few concessions. And we would . . . we had no choice. Every human life had to be protected.\\n\\n I even went limp in relief. You might say, what was the boy to me, anyway? If he\u0027d drawn the short straw, he could have been the legitimate prey of vampires and werewolves. That\u0027s just the way life is. And I\u0027d have walked straight by. Never mind the short straw – how many times had the Night Watch got there too late, how many people had been killed by the Dark Ones? But it was a strange thing. I was already involved in the struggle for him, I\u0027d stepped into the Twilight and spilled blood. And it wasn\u0027t all the same to me any more. Not by a long way . . .\\n\\n Conversations in the Twilight move a lot faster than they do in the human world. But I still had to divide myself between Olga and Svetlana.\\n\\n \u0027Anton, don\u0027t bother your head about my problems.\u0027\\n\\n In spite of everything, I felt like laughing. Right then there were hundreds of heads trying to deal with her problems, and Svetlana had no idea, she knew nothing about it. But it was enough to mention other people\u0027s problems, so tiny in comparison with the black Inferno vortex, and she immediately started worrying about them.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 I said, \u0027there\u0027s a law called the law of paired events. You have problems, but I wasn\u0027t talking about them. There\u0027s someone else who has really big problems. His own personal problems. But that doesn\u0027t make them any easier.\u0027\\n\\n She understood. I liked the fact that she wasn\u0027t embarrassed either. She just added:\\n\\n \u0027My problems are personal too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not entirely,\u0027 I said. \u0027At least, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And that other person – can you help him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someone else will help him,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure? Thanks for listening to me, but it\u0027s impossible to help me. It\u0027s just my dumb destiny, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is she throwing me out?\u0027 I asked through the Twilight. I didn\u0027t want to touch her mind right then.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Olga replied. \u0027No . . . Anton, she can feel it.\u0027\\n\\n Did she really have some Other powers? Or was it just a freak upsurge, triggered by the Inferno being there so long?\\n\\n \u0027What can she feel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That you\u0027re needed at the other place.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That crazy bloodsucking bitch is demanding you for the negotiations. The one who killed her partner.\u0027\\n\\n That really made me feel sick. We\u0027d done an elective on anti-terrorist tactics, more so that we could avoid having to use our powers as Others if we got caught up in human disputes than for any real requirements of the job. We\u0027d covered terrorist psychology, and in those terms, the girl vampire was acting perfectly logically. I was the first Watch agent she had ever come across. I\u0027d killed her mentor and wounded her. For her the image of her enemy was concentrated in me.\\n\\n \u0027How long has she been asking for me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About ten minutes.\u0027\\n\\n I looked into Svetlana\u0027s eyes. Dry, calm, not a single tear. The hardest thing of all is when pain is hidden behind a mask of calm.\\n\\n \u0027Sveta, would you mind if I went now?\u0027\\n\\n She shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027This is all so stupid . . .\u0027 I said. \u0027It seems to me that you need help right now. At least someone who can listen to you. Or is willing to sit beside you and drink cold tea.\u0027\\n\\n A faint smile and a barely perceptible nod.\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027re right, there is someone else who needs help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, you\u0027re strange.\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head:\\n\\n \u0027Not just strange. Very strange.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have this feeling . . . I\u0027ve known you for a long time, but it\u0027s like we\u0027d never met before. And then – it\u0027s like you\u0027re talking to me and someone else at the same time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027That\u0027s it exactly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe I\u0027m going insane.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton . . . this wasn\u0027t just a chance visit, was it?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. Olga whispered something and stopped talking. The gigantic vortex rotated slowly above Svetlana\u0027s head.\\n\\n \u0027No, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 I said. \u0027I came to help.\u0027\\n\\n If the Dark Magician who had cursed her was watching us . . . That is, if it wasn\u0027t just an accidental \u0027mother\u0027s curse\u0027, but a calculated blow struck by a professional. . .\\n\\n We looked at each other without saying anything.\\n\\n I had the feeling I could almost grasp what was really going on here. The answer was there, right beside me, and all our theories were stupid nonsense, we were following the old rules and maps that the boss had asked me to disregard. But to do that, I needed to think, I had to cut myself off for at least a second from what was going on, stare at a blank wall or a mindless TV screen and stop feeling torn between the desire to help one small human being or tens or hundreds of thousands of people. Stop swinging one way then the other trying to resolve this lousy mess, which would still turn out badly whichever way the cards fell, and the only difference it would make to me was that I would die quickly when the blast of the Inferno flung me into the grey expanses of the Twilight world, or slowly and painfully, kindling the dull flame of self-contempt in my own heart.\\n\\n \u0027Sveta, I\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Anton!\u0027 It wasn\u0027t Olga, it was the boss. \u0027Anton . . .\u0027\\n\\n He stopped, he couldn\u0027t give me any orders, the situation was an ethical impasse. The girl vampire was obviously sticking to her demands and refusing to negotiate with anyone except me. If he ordered me to stay, the boss would condemn the young hostage to death. He couldn\u0027t order me, he couldn\u0027t even ask me.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re organising your withdrawal. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Better just tell the vampire I\u0027m coming.\u0027\\n\\n Svetlana reached out and touched my hand:\\n\\n \u0027Are you going away for ever?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Till the morning,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want you to go,\u0027 she said simply. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-22.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
