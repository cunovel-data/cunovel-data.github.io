{"id":101385,"no":68,"title":"Page 68","content":"And for me he\u0027d become a personal failure – after all, I had been the first to discover he was an Other – and a good person, at least so far, and a future enemy in the eternal struggle between Good and Evil. The memory of his undecided destiny had remained buried somewhere deep under all the rest.\\n\\n He could still become absolutely anyone. His future potential was indeterminate. An open book. A Book of Destiny.\\n\\n He was the one who would stand in front of Svetlana when she picked up the piece of chalk. And he would do it gladly, once Gesar had explained what it was all about. A serious, logical explanation. The boss of the Night Watch, the leader of the Light Ones of Moscow, a great and ancient magician – he\u0027d be able to explain everything clearly. Gesar would talk about correcting mistakes. And it would be the truth. Gesar would talk about the great future that would open up for Egor. And even that would be true! The Dark Ones could lodge a thousand protests, but the Inquisition would certainly take into account that the boy had initially suffered from their actions.\\n\\n Svetlana would certainly be told that I was depressed by my failure with Egor. And that the main reason the boy had suffered was because the Watch had been busy saving her.\\n\\n She wouldn\u0027t even hesitate.\\n\\n She\u0027d accept everything she was told to do.\\n\\n She\u0027d pick up the piece of ordinary chalk that could be used to draw squares for hopscotch in the street or to write \u00272 + 2 \u003d 4\u0027 on a school blackboard.\\n\\n And she\u0027d start shaping a destiny that hadn\u0027t been defined yet.\\n\\n What were they planning to make him into?\\n\\n Who?\\n\\n A chief, a leader of new parties and revolutions?\\n\\n A prophet of religions that hadn\u0027t been created yet?\\n\\n A thinker who would found a new school of social thought? A musician, a poet, a writer, whose work would change the consciousness of millions?\\n\\n Just how many years into the future did the plan of the powers of the Light extend?\\n\\n The original essential nature of an Other could not be changed. Egor would always be a very weak magician, but thanks to the intervention of the Night Watch, he would be a Light Magician.\\n\\n And in order to alter the destiny of the human world, you didn\u0027t have to be an Other. It could even get in the way. It would be much better to have the support of the Watch while you led the human crowd, so much in need of the happiness we had invented for it.\\n\\n And he would lead them. I didn\u0027t know how, and I didn\u0027t know where, but he would lead them. But that was when the Dark Ones would make their move. An assassin can be found for every president. And for every prophet there are a thousand interpreters to distort the essence of the religion, to replace the bright flame with the heat of the inquisitors\u0027 pyres. The time came when every book was cast into the fire, when every symphony was reduced to a popular tune and played in all the bars.\\n\\n No, we hadn\u0027t learned a thing. Probably because we didn\u0027t want to.\\n\\n But at least I still had a bit of time. And the right to make my move. My only move.\\n\\n If only I knew what it was.\\n\\n Should I appeal to Svetlana not to accept what Gesar said, not to get involved in higher magic, not to change anyone else\u0027s destiny?\\n\\n But why should she agree? Everything was being done correctly. Mistakes that had been made were being put right, a positive future was being created both for a single individual and for humanity as a whole. I was being relieved of the burden of the mistake I\u0027d made. Svetlana was being relieved of the knowledge that her good fortune had been paid for by someone else\u0027s tragedy. She was entering the ranks of the Great Sorceresses. What did my vague doubts mean compared to all that? And what were they really? How much was genuine concern, and how much petty self-interest? Where was the Light, where was the Dark?\\n\\n \u0027Hey, friend!\u0027\\n\\n The street trader who owned the stall I was standing in front of was staring at me. Not really angry, just rather annoyed.\\n\\n \u0027You buying anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do I look like an idiot?\u0027 I asked him.\\n\\n \u0027Sure you do. If you\u0027re not buying, move on.\u0027\\n\\n From where he stood he was right. But I was in the mood to talk back.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t realise how lucky you are. I\u0027m collecting a crowd for you, attracting customers.\u0027\\n\\n He was a colourful character. Stocky, red-faced, with huge thick arms, rippling masses of fat and muscle. He sized me up, obviously didn\u0027t see anything threatening and got ready to make some caustic remark.\\n\\n Then suddenly he smiled.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, if you\u0027re collecting a crowd, put a bit more effort into it. Pretend to buy something. You can even pretend to pay me some money.\u0027\\n\\n This was a pleasant surprise.\\n\\n I smiled back at him:\\n\\n \u0027Would you like me to buy something for real?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What would you do that for? This is rubbish for the tourists.\u0027 The trader stopped smiling, but there was no tension or aggression left in his face. \u0027This damn heat, it\u0027s driving me crazy. I wish it would rain.\u0027\\n\\n I looked up at the sky and shrugged. Something seemed to be changing. Something had shifted in the transparent blue dome of the heavenly oven.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s going to,\u0027 I told him.\\n\\n \u0027Great.\u0027\\n\\n We nodded at each other and I walked away, slipping into the stream of people.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to do, but I already knew where to go. And that was a start.\\n\\n CHAPTER 7\\n\\n TO A LARGE extent our powers are borrowed.\\n\\n The Dark Ones draw theirs from the suffering of humans. Things are a lot simpler for them. They don\u0027t even have to cause people any pain. They can just wait. Just keep their eyes open and keep absorbing people\u0027s suffering, like drinking a cocktail through a straw.\\n\\n We can do the same, only with one small difference. We draw strength from people who are feeling good, when they\u0027re happy. But there\u0027s one little difficulty that makes the process easy for the Dark Ones and almost forbidden to us. Happiness and sorrow are not just two levels on a single scale of human emotions. If they were, there\u0027d be no such thing as radiant sorrow or malicious joy. They\u0027re two parallel processes, two equal currents of power that Others can feel and use.\\n\\n When a Dark Magician drinks in someone\u0027s pain, it only increases.\\n\\n When a Light Magician takes someone\u0027s joy, it decreases.\\n\\n We can absorb power at any moment. But we very rarely allow ourselves to.\\n\\n That day I decided that I was entitled.\\n\\n I took a little bit from a couple locked in each other\u0027s arms at the entrance to the metro. They were happy, very happy just then. But I could tell that the lovers were parting, and for a long time, and sadness would inevitably come to them anyway. I decided I had the right. Their joy was bright and rich, like a bouquet of scarlet roses, proud and delicate.\\n\\n I touched a child as he ran past – he was happy, he didn\u0027t feel the oppressive heat, he was running to buy an ice cream. He would soon restore his power. It was as simple and pure as wild flowers. A posy of daisies that I gathered without hesitation.\\n\\n I saw an old woman in a window. The shadow of death was already hovering over her, she could probably sense it herself. But she was still smiling. Her grandson had called round to see her that day. Probably only to check if his grandmother was still alive, or if the valuable apartment in the centre of Moscow was free now. She understood that too, but she was still happy. I felt ashamed, unbearably ashamed, but I touched her and took a little power. A fading orange and yellow bunch of asters and autumn leaves . . .\\n\\n I walked along just as I used to in my nightmares, when I handed out happiness to everyone on all sides, making sure no one went away without his share. But the trail I left behind me now was quite different. Slightly faded smiles, wrinkled foreheads, lips pressed together in doubt.\\n\\n It was pretty easy to see where I\u0027d been.\\n\\n If I met a Day Watch patrol, they wouldn\u0027t stop me.\\n\\n And even if any Light Ones saw what was happening, they wouldn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n I was doing what I thought was necessary. What I believed I had a right to do. Borrowing. Stealing. And the way I used the power I\u0027d taken would seal my destiny.\\n\\n Either I\u0027d pay back all my debts in full.\\n\\n Or the Twilight would open its arms to embrace me.\\n\\n When a Light Magician starts drawing power from humans, he\u0027s gambling everything on a single throw of the dice. And the usual balancing of accounts between the actions of the two Watches didn\u0027t apply.\\n\\n Not only did the amount of Good that was done have to exceed the amount of Evil I had caused, I would have to be certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that I\u0027d paid everything back in full.\\n\\n The lovers, the children, the old people. The group drinking beer by the statue. I\u0027d been afraid their happiness might turn out to be a sham, but it was genuine, and I took their power.\\n\\n Forgive me.\\n\\n I could apologise to every one of them three times over. I could pay for what I\u0027d taken. But I wouldn\u0027t really mean it.\\n\\n I was simply fighting for love. In the first place. And only after that for you, the humans for whom this new happiness was being prepared.\\n\\n But what if I were really doing that as well?\\n\\n What if, every time you fought for love, you were fighting for the whole world?\\n\\n For the whole world – not against the whole world.\\n\\n Power!\\n\\n Power.\\n\\n Power?\\n\\n I gathered it in crumbs, sometimes gently, sometimes in crude haste, to prevent my hand from trembling and my eyes from looking away in shame, as I took almost all there was.\\n\\n Maybe happiness was a rare experience anyway for this young man.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n Power!\\n\\n Maybe without this smile, this woman would lose someone\u0027s love.\\n\\n Power.\\n\\n Maybe tomorrow this strong man with the ironic smile would die.\\n\\n Power.\\n\\n The amulets in my pockets wouldn\u0027t be any use. There wasn\u0027t going be a fight. The \u0027top form\u0027 the boss had mentioned wouldn\u0027t help me either. That wouldn\u0027t be enough. And the right to carry out a second-degree intervention that Zabulon had granted me so generously was a trap. There wasn\u0027t any doubt about that. He\u0027d framed his own girlfriend, drawn the lines of probability together so that we\u0027d meet and then handed me his deadly gift with a mournful expression on his face. I couldn\u0027t see far enough into the future to be sure the Good I did would never become Evil.\\n\\n But if you have no weapon, accept one even from the hands of your enemy.\\n\\n Power!\\n\\n Power.\\n\\n Power?\\n\\n If I\u0027d still been connected to Gesar by the narrow thread that maintains contact between a young magician and his mentor, he would long ago have sensed what was happening. Sensed the energy building up inside me, the massive energy I\u0027d gathered for some unknown purpose.\\n\\n What would he have done? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-68.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
