{"id":101343,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Bear shifted forward slightly. A tiny movement, as if he hadn\u0027t shifted his powerful paws at all, just slipped when the wind pushed him. I knew he\u0027d carry on sliding forward like that for another ten minutes, the same way he\u0027d been doing for an entire hour since the stand-off began. Until he thought he had a good enough chance. Then he\u0027d pounce . . . and if he was lucky, he\u0027d be able to tear the kid out of the vampire\u0027s arms with no more harm done than a couple of broken ribs.\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t keep track of everybody,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s just not possible.\u0027\\n\\n This was terrible ... I was starting to feel sorry for her. Not for the boy who\u0027d been caught up in the game played between Light and Dark, not for young Svetlana, with the curse hanging over her, not for the innocent city that would bear the full brunt of that curse ... I was feeling sorry for the vampire. It was a good question – where were we that night? The ones who call ourselves the Night Watch . . .\\n\\n \u0027In any case you still had a choice,\u0027 I said. \u0027And don\u0027t tell me you didn\u0027t. Initiation can only take place by mutual consent. You could have died. Died honestly. As a human being.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Honestly?\u0027 The vampire shook her head, scattering her hair across her shoulders. Where was Semyon? . . . How hard could it be to climb to the roof of a twelve-storey building? \u0027It would have been good to die – honestly. But the person who signed the licence . . . the one who earmarked me as food. Was he acting honestly?\u0027\\n\\n Light and Dark . . .\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t simply the victim of a vampire on the rampage. She\u0027d been marked down as prey, chosen by a blind throw of the dice. She had been destined to give up her life for the continuation of someone else\u0027s death. But that young guy who had crumbled into a heap of dust at my feet when he was incinerated by the seal had fallen in love with her. Really fallen in love . . . and he hadn\u0027t completely sucked out the girl\u0027s life, he\u0027d turned her into his equal.\\n\\n The dead can do more than tear off heads, they can fall in love too. The trouble is that even their love requires blood.\\n\\n He\u0027d had no choice but to conceal her, since he\u0027d turned the girl into a vampire illegally. He\u0027d needed to feed her, and only live blood would do for that, not the bottled blood of naïve donors.\\n\\n So he\u0027d started poaching on the streets of Moscow, and then we\u0027d started to pay attention, the keepers of the Light, the valiant Night Watch, who hand victims over to the Dark Ones.\\n\\n In a war the most dangerous thing is to understand the enemy. To understand is to forgive. And we have no right to do that – we never have had, not since the creation of the world.\\n\\n \u0027Even so, you still had a choice,\u0027 I said. \u0027You did. Someone else\u0027s betrayal is no excuse for your own.\u0027\\n\\n She laughed quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes . . . good servant of the Light . . . Of course. You\u0027re right. And you can tell me a thousand times that I\u0027m dead. That my soul has burned away and evaporated into the Twilight. But if I\u0027m so malevolent, can you explain to me what the difference is between us? Explain that. . . make me believe it.\u0027\\n\\n The vampire lowered her head and looked into Egor\u0027s face. She spoke in an intimate, almost friendly tone:\\n\\n \u0027And you, boy, do you understand me? Answer me. Answer me honestly, don\u0027t take any notice of . . . my claws. I won\u0027t take offence.\u0027\\n\\n Bear made another tiny movement forward. I could feel his muscles tensing as he prepared to leap.\\n\\n But then Semyon appeared behind the vampire, without a sound, with a movement that was smooth and quick at the same time – how did he manage to move that fast in the human world?\\n\\n \u0027Wake up, little one!\u0027 the vampire said encouragingly. \u0027Answer! Only honestly! And if you think he\u0027s right and I\u0027m wrong ... if you really believe that... I\u0027ll let you go.\u0027\\n\\n I caught Egor\u0027s eye.\\n\\n And I knew what he was going to say.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right too.\u0027\\n\\n A cold, empty feeling. No strength left for emotions. Let them show on the outside, let them blaze like a bonfire that people couldn\u0027t see.\\n\\n \u0027What do you want?\u0027 I asked. \u0027To exist? All right . . . give yourself up. There\u0027ll be a trial, a joint court of the Watches.\u0027\\n\\n The girl vampire looked at me and shook her head:\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t trust your court. Not the Night Watch or the Day Watch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why did you call me here?\u0027 I asked. Semyon was moving towards the vampire, getting closer . . .\\n\\n \u0027For vengeance,\u0027 she said simply. \u0027You killed my friend. I\u0027m going to kill yours . . . while you watch. And then . . . I\u0027m going to try ... to kill you. But even if I fail. . .\u0027 She smiled. \u0027. . . you\u0027ll always know you didn\u0027t save the boy. Won\u0027t you, Watchman? You sign those licences without thinking about real people. And the moment you do look . . . out creeps your morality . . . your rotten, false, cheap morality. . .\u0027\\n\\n Semyon leapt.\\n\\n And Bear leapt at the same time.\\n\\n It was beautiful, and it was faster than any bullet or any spell, because in the end all that\u0027s left is the body striking the blow and the skill acquired over twenty, forty, a hundred years . . .\\n\\n But I still pulled the pistol out from behind me and jerked the trigger, knowing that the bullet would fly through the air slowly and lazily, like a \u0027high-speed\u0027 shot from a cheap action movie, still leaving the vampire a chance to dodge, a chance to kill.\\n\\n Semyon flattened out in the air, as if he\u0027d hit a wall of glass, and slid down an invisible barrier, shifting into the Twilight as he went. Bear was flung off to one side – and he was far bigger. The bullet, crawling towards the vampire with all the grace of a dragonfly, flared up in a bright petal of flame and disappeared.\\n\\n If it wasn\u0027t for the way the vampire\u0027s eyes were opening wider and wider, I might have thought she\u0027d conjured up the protective shield herself. But that\u0027s something only the most powerful magicians can do.\\n\\n \u0027They are under my protection .. .\u0027 a voice said behind my back.\\n\\n I swung round – and met Zabulon\u0027s gaze.\\n\\n It was amazing that the vampire didn\u0027t panic. It was amazing she didn\u0027t kill Egor. The unsuccessful attack and the sudden appearance of the Dark Magician must have been much more of a surprise to her than to us, because I\u0027d been half expecting something of the kind from the moment I took off the amulet.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t surprised he\u0027d got there so fast. The Dark Ones have their own pathways. But why had Zabulon, the observer from the Dark Side, preferred this little tussle to staying in our headquarters? Had he lost interest in Svetlana and the vortex hanging over her head? Did he know something that we had no way of figuring out?\\n\\n That wretched habit of trying to work everything out in advance! The field operatives had it beaten out of them by the very nature of their work, which was all instant response to danger, battle, victory or defeat.\\n\\n Ilya had taken out his wand. Its pale lilac glow was too bright for a third-grade magician and too steady for me to believe he could have charged it. The boss had probably charged it himself.\\n\\n So he must have been expecting something.\\n\\n He must have been expecting someone to turn up with powers that matched his own.\\n\\n Neither Tiger Cub nor Bear changed their form. Their magic didn\u0027t require any external devices, and certainly not human bodies. Bear kept his eyes fixed on the vampire, totally ignoring Zabulon. Tiger Cub stood beside me. Semyon walked slowly round the vampire, rubbing his waist and deliberately making sure she saw him. He left the Dark Magician to us too.\\n\\n \u0027They?\u0027 Tiger Cub growled.\\n\\n It took me a moment to realise what was bothering her.\\n\\n \u0027They are under my protection,\u0027 Zabulon repeated. The magician was wrapped in a shapeless black coat and his head was covered with a crumpled beret of dark fur. He had his hands in his pockets, but somehow I was certain there was nothing there, no amulets, no guns.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 screeched the girl vampire. \u0027Who are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your protector and mentor,\u0027 said Zabulon, looking at me. Not even straight at me, more a casual glance past me. \u0027Your master.\u0027\\n\\n Had he gone insane? The girl vampire had no idea of the balance of forces here. She was wound up, ready to blow. She had been prepared to die ... to end her existence. Now she suddenly had a chance to survive, but the way he spoke . . .\\n\\n \u0027I have no master!\u0027 The girl whose life depended on other people\u0027s death laughed. \u0027Whoever you are – from the Light, or from the Dark – remember that! I have no master and never will!\u0027\\n\\n She began backing away towards the edge of the roof, dragging Egor after her. Still clutching him with one arm, holding the other hand at his throat. A hostage ... a good move against the forces of Light.\\n\\n And maybe against the forces of Dark too?\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon, we accept,\u0027 I said, laying my hand on the tense muscles of Tiger Cub\u0027s back. \u0027She is yours. Take her – until the trial. We honour the Treaty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am taking them,\u0027 said Zabulon, gazing forward blindly. The wind was lashing into his face, but the magician\u0027s unblinking eyes remained wide open, as if they were made of glass. \u0027The woman and the boy are ours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Only the vampire.\u0027\\n\\n He finally deigned to look at me.\\n\\n \u0027Agent of the Light, I am only taking what is mine. I honour the Great Treaty. The woman and the boy are ours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are stronger than any of us,\u0027 I said, \u0027but you are alone, Zabulon.\u0027\\n\\n The Dark Magician shook his head and smiled in mournful sympathy.\\n\\n \u0027No, Anton Gorodetsky.\u0027\\n\\n They came out from behind the lift shaft, a young man and a young woman. I knew them. Oh yes, I knew them.\\n\\n Alisa and Pyotr. The witch and the warlock from Day Watch.\\n\\n \u0027Egor!\u0027 Zabulon said in a quiet voice. \u0027Have you understood the difference between us? Which side do you choose?\u0027\\n\\n The boy didn\u0027t answer. But perhaps only because the vampire\u0027s claws were pressed against his neck.\\n\\n \u0027Have we got a problem here?\u0027 Tiger Cub asked in a purring voice.\\n\\n \u0027Uhuh,\u0027 I confirmed.\\n\\n \u0027Your decision?\u0027 asked Zabulon. His Watch agents weren\u0027t saying anything yet, keeping out of it.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like this,\u0027 said Tiger Cub. She edged a little closer to Zabulon and her tail lashed me mercilessly across one knee. \u0027I don\u0027t like the Day Watch\u0027s view of what\u0027s going on here . . . not one bit.\u0027\\n\\n Bear obviously shared her opinion: when they worked as a pair, one of them spoke for both. I looked at Ilya: he was twirling the wand in his fingers, smiling darkly as if he was thinking. Like a child who\u0027s brought a loaded Uzi to a party instead of a plastic machine gun. Semyon was clearly up for anything. He didn\u0027t give a damn about petty details. He\u0027d spent seventy years running over rooftops.\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon, do you speak for the Day Watch?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n I saw a brief flicker of doubt in the Dark Magician\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n What was going on? Why had Zabulon left our headquarters, abandoning the chance to track down an unknown magician of incredible power and enlist him in the Day Watch? You didn\u0027t just abandon an opportunity like that, not even for a vampire and a kid with potentially great powers. Why was Zabulon determined to go head to head?\\n\\n And why on earth was he so reluctant – I could sense it, there was no doubt about it – to speak in the name of the Day Watch?\\n\\n \u0027I speak as a private individual,\u0027 said Zabulon.\\n\\n \u0027Then we have a few little personal disagreements,\u0027 I answered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-25.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
