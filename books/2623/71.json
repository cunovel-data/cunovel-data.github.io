For some it means changing other people\u0027s lives and destroying empires. For others it simply means getting on with life.\u0027\n \u0027While the Day Watch was waiting for you to act,\u0027 I explained, \u0027Olga took the other half of the chalk and rewrote someone else\u0027s destiny. The way the Light wanted it to be.\u0027\n Gesar sighed. He reached out and touched Egor. The boy stirred and tried to get up.\n \u0027No hurry, no hurry,\u0027 the boss said gently. \u0027It\u0027s all over now, or almost.\u0027\n I put my arm round the boy\u0027s shoulders and rested his head on my knees. He calmed down again.\n \u0027Why all this?\u0027 I asked. \u0027If you knew in advance what would happen?\u0027\n \u0027Even I can\u0027t know everything.\u0027\n \u0027But why all this?\u0027\n \u0027Because everything had to look natural,\u0027 Gesar said, slightly annoyed. \u0027That was the only way Zabulon would believe what was happening. He had to believe in our plans, and believe that we failed.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not the full answer, Gesar,\u0027 I said, looking into his eyes. \u0027It\u0027s not even close!\u0027\n The boss sighed.\n \u0027All right. Yes, I could have done things differently. Svetlana would have become a Great Sorceress. Against her own wishes. And Egor would have become our instrument, despite the fact that the Watch was already in his debt.\u0027\n I waited. I was very interested to see if Gesar would tell the whole truth. Just once.\n \u0027Yes, I could have done it that way,\u0027 said Gesar, and sighed again. \u0027But you know, my boy . . . Everything that I\u0027ve done in the twentieth century, apart from the great struggle between the Light and the Dark, has been dedicated to a single purpose that, naturally, brought no harm to our cause. . .\u0027\n I suddenly felt sorry for him. Incredibly sorry. Perhaps for the first time in a thousand years the Great Magician, the Most Light Gesar, destroyer of monsters and guardian of states, had been forced to tell the entire truth. Not the beautiful and exalted truth that he was used to telling.\n \u0027Don\u0027t, don\u0027t. I know!\u0027 I shouted.\n But the Great Magician shook his head.\n \u0027Everything I\u0027ve done was dedicated to that purpose. To force the senior levels to repeal Olga\u0027s punishment completely. To force them to restore her powers and allow her to pick up the chalk of Destiny once again. She had to become my equal. Otherwise our love was doomed. And I love her, Anton.\u0027\n Svetlana laughed. Very, very quietly. I thought she was going to slap the boss\u0027s face, but I suppose I still didn\u0027t understand her completely. Svetlana went down on her knees in front of Gesar and kissed his right hand.\n The magician trembled. He seemed for a moment to have lost his infinite powers: the protective dome began shuddering and dissolving. Once more we were deafened by the roar of the hurricane.\n \u0027Are we going to change the destiny of the world again?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Apart from our own little personal concerns?\u0027\n He nodded and asked in return:\n \u0027Why, don\u0027t you like the idea?\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Well, Anton, you can\u0027t always be a winner. I haven\u0027t, and you won\u0027t be either.\u0027\n \u0027I know that,\u0027 I said. \u0027Of course I know it, Gesar. But still, it would be nice.\u0027\n January–August 1998\n Moscow\n Read on for an extract of\n The Day Watch\n PROLOGUE\n THE ENTRANCE DID not inspire respect. The coded lock was broken and not working, the floor was littered with the trampled butts of cheap cigarettes. Inside the lift the walls were covered with illiterate graffiti, in which the word \u0027Spartak\u0027 figured as often as the usual crude obscenities; the plastic buttons had been burned through with cigarettes and painstakingly plugged with chewing-gum that was now rock-hard.\n The door into the apartment on the fourth floor was a good match for the entrance: some hideous old kind of Soviet artificial leather, cheap aluminium numbers barely held up by their crookedly inserted screws.\n Natasha hesitated for a moment before she pressed the doorbell. She must be insane to hope for anything from a place like this. If you were so crazy or desperate that you decided to try magic, you could just open the newspaper, switch on the TV or listen to the radio. There were serious spiritualist salons, experienced mediums with internationally recognised diplomas ... It was all still a con, of course. But at least you\u0027d be in pleasant surroundings, with pleasant people, not like this last resort for hopeless losers.\n She rang the bell anyway. She didn\u0027t want to waste the time she\u0027d spent on the journey.\n For a few moments it seemed that the apartment was empty. Then she heard hasty footsteps, the steps of someone in a hurry whose worn slippers are slipping off their feet as they shuffle along. For a brief instant the tiny spy-hole went dark, then the lock grated and the door opened.\n \u0027Oh, Natasha, is it? Come in, come in . . .\u0027\n She had never liked people who spoke too familiarly from the very first meeting. There ought to be a little more formality at first.\n But the woman who had opened the door was already pulling her into the apartment, clutching her unceremoniously by the hand, and with an expression of such sincere hospitality on her ageing, brightly made-up face that Natasha didn\u0027t feel strong enough to object.\n \u0027My friend told me that you . . .\u0027 Natasha began.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t know about that, my dear,\u0027 said her hostess, waving her hands in the air. \u0027Oh, don\u0027t take your shoes off, I was just going to clean the place up . . . oh, all right then, I\u0027ll try to find you a pair of slippers.\u0027\n Natasha looked around, concealing her disgust with difficulty.\n The hall wasn\u0027t so very small, but it was crammed incredibly full. The light bulb hanging from the ceiling was dull, maybe thirty watts at best, but even that couldn\u0027t conceal the general squalor. The hallstand was heaped high with clothes, including a musquash winter coat to feed the moths. The lino of the small area of floor that could be seen was an indistinct grey colour. Natasha\u0027s hostess must have been planning her cleaning session for a long time.\n \u0027Your name\u0027s Natasha, isn\u0027t it, my daughter? Mine\u0027s Dasha.\u0027\n Dasha was fifteen or twenty years older than her. At least. She could have been Natasha\u0027s mother, but with a mother like that you\u0027d want to hang yourself ... A pudgy figure, with dirty, dull hair and bright nail varnish peeling from her fingernails, wearing a washed-out house coat and crumbling slippers on her bare feet. Her toenails glittered with nail varnish too. God, how vulgar!\n \u0027Are you a seer?\u0027 Natasha asked. And in her own mind she cried: \u0027What a fool I am.\u0027\n Dasha nodded. She bent down and extracted a pair of rubber slippers from a tangled heap of footwear. The most idiotic kind of slippers ever invented – with all those rubber prongs sticking out on the inside. A Yogi\u0027s dream. Some of them had fallen off long before, but that didn\u0027t make the slippers look any more comfortable.\n \u0027Put them on!\u0027 Dasha suggested joyfully.\n As if hypnotised, Natasha took off her sandals and put on the slippers. Goodbye, tights. She was bound to end up with a couple of ladders. Even in her famous Omsa tights with their famous Lycra. Everything in this world was a swindle invented by cunning fools. And for some reason intelligent people always fell for it.\n \u0027Yes, I\u0027m a seer,\u0027 Dasha declared as she attentively supervised the donning of the slippers. \u0027I got it from my grandma. And my mum too. They were all seers, they all helped people, it runs in our family . . . Come through into the kitchen, Natasha, I haven\u0027t tidied up the rooms yet . . .\u0027\n Still cursing herself for being so stupid, Natasha went into the kitchen, which fulfilled all her expectations. A heap of dirty dishes in the sink and a filthy table – as they appeared, a cockroach crawled lazily off the table-top and round under it. A sticky floor. The windows had obviously not been spring-cleaned and the ceiling was fly-spotted.\n \u0027Sit down.\u0027 Dasha deftly pulled out a stool from under the table and moved it over to the place of honour – between the table and the fridge, a convulsively twitching Saratov.\n \u0027Thank you, I\u0027ll stand.\u0027 Natasha had made her mind up definitely not to sit down. The stool inspired even less confidence than the table or the floor. \u0027Dasha . . . That\u0027s Darya?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Darya.\u0027\n \u0027Darya, I really only wanted to find out . . .\u0027\n The woman shrugged. She flicked the switch on the electric kettle – probably the only object in the kitchen that didn\u0027t look as if it had been retrieved from a rubbish tip. She looked at Natasha.\n \u0027Find out? There\u0027s nothing to find out. Everything\u0027s just as clear as can be.\u0027\n For a moment Natasha had an unpleasant, oppressive sensation, as if there wasn\u0027t enough light in the kitchen. Everything went grey, the agonised rumbling of the refrigerator and the traffic outside on the avenue fell silent. She wiped the icy perspiration from her forehead. It was the heat. The summer, the heat, the long journey in the metro, the crush in the trolleybus . . .Why hadn\u0027t she taken a taxi? She\u0027d sent away the driver with the car – well, she\u0027d been embarrassed to give anyone even a hint of where she was going and why . . . but why hadn\u0027t she taken a taxi?\n \u0027Your husband\u0027s left you, Natashenka,\u0027 Darya said affectionately. \u0027Two weeks ago. Left all of a sudden, packed, threw his things into a suitcase and just upped and left you. Without any quarrels, without any arguments. He left the apartment, left the car. And he went to the other woman, that pretty young bitch with black eyebrows . . . but you\u0027re not old yet, my daughter.\u0027\n This time Natasha didn\u0027t even react to the words \u0027my daughter\u0027. She was trying desperately to remember what she\u0027d told her friend and what she hadn\u0027t. She didn\u0027t think she\u0027d mentioned black eyebrows. Although the girl really did have dark skin, and black hair . . . Natasha was again overcome by a wild, blind fury.\n \u0027And I know why he left, Natashenka . . . Forgive me for calling you my daughter, you\u0027re a strong woman, used to making up your own mind about things, but you\u0027re all like my own daughters to me . . .You didn\u0027t have any children, Natasha. Did you?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Natasha whispered.\n \u0027But why not, my dear?\u0027 the seer asked, shaking her head reproachfully. \u0027He wants a daughter, right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, a daughter . . .\u0027\n \u0027Then why didn\u0027t you have one?\u0027 Darya asked with a shrug. \u0027I\u0027ve got five children. Two of them went into the army, the eldest. One daughter\u0027s married, she\u0027s nursing her baby now, the other\u0027s studying. And the youngest, the wild one . . .\u0027 She waved her hand through the air. \u0027Sit down, why don\u0027t you . . .\u0027\n Natasha reluctantly lowered herself onto the stool, holding her handbag firmly on her knees. Trying to seize the initiative, she said:\n \u0027It\u0027s just the way life worked out. Well ... I would have had a child for him, but you can\u0027t ruin your career for that.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s true too.\u0027 The seer didn\u0027t try to argue. She rubbed her face with her hands. \u0027It\u0027s your choice . . . Right then, you want to bring him back? But why did he leave? The other woman\u0027s already carrying his child . . . and she made a real effort too. Listening to him, and sympathising with him, and getting up to all sorts of tricks in bed . . .You had a good man, the kind every woman wants to get. Do you want to bring him back? Even now?\u0027\n Natasha pursed her lips.\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n The seer sighed.\n \u0027We can bring him back . . . we can . . .\u0027 Her tone of voice had changed subtly, become firm and emphatic.\u0027. . . only it won\u0027t be easy. Just bringing him back isn\u0027t all that hard, it\u0027s keeping him that\u0027s the problem!\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-71.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
