{"id":101367,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"Maxim looked at me again, and I saw the piercing glint of the Twilight in his eyes again. He was trying to see the lie, to see the Dark, to see the malice and hatred – the only things he was capable of seeing.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not a Dark One,\u0027 he said. It was almost a complaint. \u0027I can see that. I\u0027ve never been wrong, never!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a watchman,\u0027 I repeated. I glanced around – there was no one to be seen. Something had frightened everyone away. That was probably one of the Maverick\u0027s powers.\\n\\n \u0027That boy . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s an Other too,\u0027 I said quickly. \u0027It\u0027s not clear yet if he\u0027s going to be Light or—\u0027\\n\\n Maxim shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s Dark.\u0027\\n\\n I glanced at Egor. The boy slowly raised his eyes to meet mine.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n I could see his aura quite clearly – bright, pure, shimmering colours, typical for very young children, but not for teenagers. His destiny was his own, his future was still undefined.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s Dark,\u0027 said Maxim, shaking his head again. \u0027Don\u0027t you see? I\u0027m never wrong, never. You stopped me from exterminating an envoy of the Dark.\u0027\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t likely to be lying. He might not have been given many skills but the ones he had were powerful. Maxim could see the Dark, he could spot the tiniest hints of it in other people\u0027s souls. In fact, he saw the Dark that was just being born more clearly than any other kind.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t just kill every Dark One we come across.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have a truce, Maxim.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there can be no truce with the Dark.\u0027\\n\\n I shuddered. I hadn\u0027t heard the faintest note of doubt in his voice.\\n\\n \u0027Any war is worse than peace.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Except this one.\u0027 Maxim raised the hand holding the dagger. \u0027You see this? It was a present from a friend of mine. He was killed, maybe people like this boy were responsible. The Dark is cunning!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think you need to tell me that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course. You may be a Light One . . .\u0027 His face twisted in a bitter grin. \u0027But if you are, your Light faded a long time ago. There can be no forgiveness for Evil. There can be no truce with Evil.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No forgiveness for Evil?\u0027 Now I was really angry. \u0027After you stabbed the Dark Magician, you should have tried hanging around for another ten minutes. Or didn\u0027t you want to see his children screaming and his wife crying? They\u0027re not Dark Ones, Maxim. They\u0027re ordinary people who don\u0027t have our powers. You saved that girl they were shooting at. . .\u0027\\n\\n He flinched, but his face remained as implacably stony as ever.\\n\\n \u0027Well done! But did you know they were trying to kill her because of the crime you\u0027d committed? Well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is war.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve started your own war,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027You\u0027re like a child, with your toy dagger. You can\u0027t make an omelette without breaking eggs, is that it? No holds barred in the great struggle for the Light?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t fight for the Light,\u0027 he said in a quiet voice. \u0027I fight against the Dark. That\u0027s all I\u0027m capable of. Do you understand? And you\u0027re wrong, it isn\u0027t a matter of eggs and omelettes for me. I didn\u0027t ask for this power, I didn\u0027t dream of having it. But since it has come to me, I can\u0027t act any other way.\u0027\\n\\n Just who was it who hadn\u0027t noticed him in time?\\n\\n Why hadn\u0027t we found Maxim straight away, as soon as he became an Other?\\n\\n He\u0027d have made a first-class field operative. After long arguments and explanations. After months of training, after years of exercises, after tantrums, mistakes, bouts of drinking, attempts to kill himself. Eventually he would have understood the rules of the confrontation – not with his heart, he wasn\u0027t capable of that, but with his cold, uncompromising reason. The rules that govern the struggle between the Light and the Dark, that mean we have to turn a blind eye to werewolves hunting their victims and kill our own people who can\u0027t do that.\\n\\n There he was, right in front of me. A Light Magician who\u0027d killed more Dark Ones in a few years than a field operative with a hundred years of experience. Alone, cornered. Knowing only how to hate, incapable of love.\\n\\n Egor just stood there quietly behind me, listening intently. I turned round, took him by the shoulders and pushed him in front of me. I said:\\n\\n \u0027Is he a Dark Magician? Probably – I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re right. In a few more years, this kid will start to sense his own powers. As he goes through life, the Dark will creep alongside him. With every step his life will become easier and easier. And every step will be paid for by someone else\u0027s pain. Do you remember the fairy tale about the mermaid? A witch gave her legs, she could walk, but she felt like there were red-hot knives stabbing into her feet all the time. That story\u0027s about us, Maxim! We always walk over sharp knives, and that\u0027s something you can never get used to. But Hans Christian Andersen didn\u0027t tell the whole story. The witch could have done things differently: the mermaid walks, and the knives stab other people. That\u0027s the way of the Dark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I carry my own pain with me,\u0027 said Maxim, and I suddenly felt an insane hope that he could understand after all. \u0027But that mustn\u0027t be allowed to change anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you prepared to kill him?\u0027 I said, nodding towards Egor. \u0027Tell me, Maxim. I\u0027m a Night Watch agent, I know where the line runs between Good and Evil. You can create Evil, even by killing Dark Ones. Tell me – are you prepared to kill him?\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t hesitate. He just nodded, looking straight into my eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I am, I\u0027ve never let a creature of the Dark get away. I won\u0027t let this one get away.\u0027\\n\\n The invisible trap snapped shut.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t have surprised me to see Zabulon standing there. To see him surface out of the Twilight and give Maxim a slap on the back. Or flash a mocking smile at me.\\n\\n But a moment later I realised Zabulon wasn\u0027t there. He never had been.\\n\\n The trap he\u0027d set didn\u0027t need any supervision. It would work all on its own. I\u0027d been caught, and every member of the Day Watch had a solid alibi for that moment.\\n\\n I either had to let Maxim kill the boy who was going to become a Dark Magician and make myself into his accomplice – with all the obvious consequences.\\n\\n Or fight the Maverick and kill him – I was far more powerful, after all. Eliminate the only witness with my own hand and kill a Light Magician into the bargain.\\n\\n Maxim would never back down. This was his war, his own cross that he\u0027d been carrying for years. He wanted victory or death.\\n\\n So why should Zabulon bother to interfere in the fight?\\n\\n He\u0027d done everything right. Purged the ranks of the Dark Ones of useless ballast, built up the tension, even deliberately shot to miss. Zabulon had made me come to this spot to meet the Maverick. And now Zabulon was somewhere far away. Maybe not even in Moscow. He might even be watching what was happening: there were plenty of technical or magical devices he could use for that. Watching and laughing.\\n\\n I was finished.\\n\\n Whichever way I jumped, the Twilight was waiting for me.\\n\\n Evil has no need to bother to eliminate Good. It\u0027s far simpler to let Good fight against itself.\\n\\n I had just one chance left, a tiny one, but it was a monstrous, vile idea.\\n\\n I could be too slow.\\n\\n I could let Maxim kill the boy, or rather, simply fail to stop him. He\u0027d calm down after that. He\u0027d go to the Night Watch headquarters with me, listen, argue and eventually give up, crushed by the boss\u0027s implacable arguments and iron logic. He\u0027d realise what he\u0027d done and just how fragile the balance he\u0027d disrupted was. And he\u0027d hand himself over to the tribunal, where he had at least a slim chance of being acquitted.\\n\\n I was no field operative, after all. I\u0027d done everything I could. I\u0027d even seen through the Dark\u0027s game, a sequence of moves devised by someone far wiser than me. I simply hadn\u0027t been strong enough, my reactions hadn\u0027t been fast enough.\\n\\n Maxim raised the hand holding the dagger.\\n\\n Time suddenly slowed down, as if I\u0027d entered the Twilight. But the colours didn\u0027t fade, they became brighter than ever. It was like moving through a stream of thick syrup. The wooden dagger glided towards Egor\u0027s chest, changing as it moved, gleaming like metal or grey flame. Maxim\u0027s face was calm and intent, only the lip held beneath his teeth betrayed how tense he was. The kid didn\u0027t understand what was happening, he didn\u0027t even try to move out of the way.\\n\\n I shoved Egor to one side – my muscles almost refused to obey me, they didn\u0027t want to do something so crazy and suicidal. For the boy, the young Dark Magician, the dagger meant death. For me, it meant life. That\u0027s the way it always has been and always will be.\\n\\n What means life for a Dark One means death for a Light One, and vice versa. Who was I to change . . . ?\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t too slow.\\n\\n Egor fell, banged his head against the door and slid down into a sitting position – I\u0027d pushed him too hard. But I was more concerned about saving him than any bruises he might get. Maxim\u0027s eyes glittered with almost childish resentment, but he could still talk.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s an enemy!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He hasn\u0027t done anything!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re defending the Dark!\u0027\\n\\n Maxim wasn\u0027t arguing about whether I was Dark or Light. He could see that well enough.\\n\\n It\u0027s just that he was whiter than white. And he\u0027d never had to decide who should live and who should die.\\n\\n The dagger was raised again. Not aimed at the boy this time, but at me. I dodged away, looked for my shadow, summoned it, and it came obediently towards me.\\n\\n The world turned grey, sounds disappeared, movement slowed. Egor stopped squirming and became completely still, the cars crept along the street uncertainly, with their wheels turning in spurts, the branches of the trees forgot about the wind. But Maxim didn\u0027t slow down.\\n\\n He\u0027d followed me in, without knowing what he was doing. Slipped into the Twilight as easily as someone stepping off the kerb on to the road. It was all the same to him now, he was drawing strength from his own certainty, his own hatred, his lighter-than-light hatred, the fury of the colour white. He wasn\u0027t the executioner of the Dark Ones any longer. He was an Inquisitor. And he was far more terrifying than our Inquisition.\\n\\n I threw my arms out, spreading my fingers in the sign of power, simple and foolproof – how the young Others laugh when they\u0027re shown that move for the first time. Maxim didn\u0027t even stop – he staggered a bit, then put his head down stubbornly and came for me again. I began to get the picture and backed away, desperately running through the magic arsenal in my mind.\\n\\n Agape – the sign of love. He didn\u0027t believe in love.\\n\\n The triple key – a sign that engendered trust and understanding. He didn\u0027t trust me.\\n\\n Opium – a lilac symbol, the path of sleep. I felt my own eyelids starting to close.\\n\\n That was how he defeated the Dark Ones. Combined with the powers of an Other, his furious faith acted like a mirror, reflecting back any blow aimed at him. It raised him up to his opponent\u0027s level. In combination with his ability to see the Dark and his ridiculous magical dagger, it made him almost invulnerable.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t reflect everything like that, though. The reflected blows didn\u0027t come back immediately. The sign of Thanatos – death – or the white sword would probably work.\\n\\n But if I killed him, I\u0027d kill myself. Set myself on the one road that we all come to in the end – into the Twilight. Into the faded dreams and colourless visions, the eternal, cold haze. He\u0027d found it so easy to see me as an enemy, but I wouldn\u0027t be strong enough to see him that way.\\n\\n We circled round each other, with Maxim sometimes making clumsy rushes at me – he\u0027d never been in a real fight before, he was used to killing his victims quickly and easily. From somewhere far away I could hear Zabulon\u0027s mocking laughter. His soft, wheedling voice. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-50.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
