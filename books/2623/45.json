{"id":101362,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"The flesh gave way. For a moment the glass was covered with a red film of blood, but then the wind swept it away. And all I could see was the vague outline of the Dark Magician\u0027s body, getting smaller and smaller, tumbling over and over in the tower\u0027s turbulent slipstream. He was being carried in the direction of The Three Little Pigs, a fashionable establishment at the foot of the tower. The clock ticking away in my mind gave a loud click and instantly halved the time I had left. I stepped off the glass and walked round the platform in a circle. I wasn\u0027t looking at the people, I was gazing into the Twilight. No, there weren\u0027t any more guards here. Now I had to find out where their headquarters were. Up on top in the service area, among all the equipment? I didn\u0027t think so. Probably somewhere more comfortable. There was another security guard, a human, standing at the top of the stairs leading down into the restaurant. One glance was enough for me to see that he\u0027d been influenced already, and quite recently. It was a good thing they\u0027d only influenced him superficially. And it was a very good thing they\u0027d decided to influence him at all. That was a trick that cut both ways. The security guard opened his mouth, getting ready to shout. \u0027Quiet! Come this way!\u0027 I ordered. The security guard followed me without saying a word. We went into the gents\u0027 – one of the tower\u0027s free attractions, the highest urinal and toilet bowls in Moscow. Please feel free to make your mark among the clouds. I waved my hand through the air. A spotty-faced youth came scurrying out of one cubicle, zipping up his trousers, another man at the urinal grunted, broke off and went wandering out with a glassy look in his eyes. \u0027Take your clothes off,\u0027 I ordered the security guard and starting pulling off my wet sweater. The guard\u0027s holster was half open, and his Desert Eagle was far older than my Makarov, but that didn\u0027t bother me. The important thing was that the uniform was almost a perfect fit. \u0027If you hear shooting,\u0027 I told the guard, \u0027go down and do your duty. Do you understand?\u0027 He nodded. \u0027I turn you towards the Light,\u0027 I said, intoning the words of the enlistment formula. \u0027Renounce the Dark, defend the Light. I give you the vision to distinguish Good from Evil. I give you the faith to follow the Light. I give you the courage to fight against the Dark.\u0027 I used to think I\u0027d never get a chance to use my right to enlist volunteers. How could there be free choice in genuine Dark? How could I involve anybody in our games when the Watches themselves were established to counterattack that practice? But now I was acting without hesitation, exploiting the loophole that the Dark Ones had left me by getting the security man to guard their headquarters, the way some people keep a small dog in their apartment: it can\u0027t bite, but it can yap. What they\u0027d done gave me the right to sway the security man in the opposite direction and get him to follow me. After all, he wasn\u0027t either good or bad, he was a perfectly ordinary man with a wife he loved in moderation, elderly parents whom he remembered to support, a young daughter and a son from his first marriage who was almost grown up, a weak faith in God, a tangled set of moral principles and a few standard dreams – an ordinary, decent man. A piece of cannon fodder in the war between the armies of Light and Dark. \u0027The Light be with you,\u0027 I said. The pathetic little man nodded and his face lit up. There was adoration in his eyes. A few hours earlier he\u0027d gazed in exactly the same way at the Dark Magician who\u0027d given him a casual command and shown him my photo. A moment later the security guard was standing at the top of the stairs in my stinking clothes, and I was walking down the stairs trying to figure out what I was going to do if Zabulon was at the headquarters. Or any other magician of his level, come to that. In that case my powers wouldn\u0027t be enough to maintain my disguise for even a second. The Bronze Hall. I stepped through the doors and looked at the absurd ring-shaped \u0027restaurant car\u0027. The ring was slowly rotating, along with the tables standing in it. I\u0027d been sure the Dark Ones would have set up their headquarters in either the Gold Hall or the Silver Hall. And I was quite surprised by the scene in front of me. The waiters were drifting from table to table like lazy fish, handing out bottles of spirits, which were supposedly forbidden up here. On two tables straight ahead of me computer terminals had been set up, connected to two mobile phones. They hadn\u0027t bothered to run a cable to any of the tower\u0027s countless service outlets, which meant the headquarters had only been set up to function for a short while. Three young guys with short hair were working away intently, with their fingers leaping around all over the keyboards while the lines of type scrolled up the monitor screens and their cigarettes smoked away in the ashtrays. I\u0027d never seen Dark programmers before, and these were only simple operators, of course. But they didn\u0027t look any different from one of our magicians sitting at a laptop plugged into the network at headquarters. Maybe they even looked a bit more respectable than some of ours. \u0027Sokolniki\u0027s completely covered,\u0027 one of them said. His voice wasn\u0027t loud, but it rumbled right round the ring of the restaurant, making the waiters shudder and falter in their stride. \u0027The Tagansko–Krasnopresnenskaya line\u0027s under surveillance,\u0027 said another. The programmers glanced at each other and laughed. They probably had a little competition going to see who could report fastest on his sectors. Go right ahead, keep looking! I set off round the restaurant, making for the bar. Take no notice of me. I\u0027m a harmless security man who just happened to be given the role of a lowly guard. And now the security man\u0027s decided he\u0027d like a beer. Has he completely lost all sense of responsibility? Or has he decided to check that his new bosses are safe? The young woman behind the bar was wiping glasses in a melancholy sort of way. When I reached her, she started pouring me a beer without saying a word. Her eyes were dark and empty, she\u0027d been turned into a puppet and I had to struggle to suppress an outburst of fury. I couldn\u0027t allow it. I had no right to feelings. I was a robot too. Puppets didn\u0027t have feelings. And then I saw the girl sitting on the tall rotating stool opposite the bar, and my heart sank again. Why hadn\u0027t I thought of that earlier? Every field headquarters has to be declared, and an observer sent over from the other side. It\u0027s part of the Treaty, one of the rules of the game, in the interest, supposedly, of both sides. If we had a field headquarters, then one of the Dark Ones was sitting in it right now. The Light One here was Tiger Cub. At first her glance slid over me with no sign of curiosity, and I was almost certain everything would be okay. Then her eyes came back to me. She\u0027d already seen the security man whose appearance I\u0027d assumed. And there was something about me that didn\u0027t match the features stored in her memory, something that bothered her. In an instant she was looking at me through the Twilight. I stood still, without trying to shield myself. Tiger Cub looked away and turned towards the magician sitting opposite her. I estimated his age at about a hundred and his powers as at least grade three. He wasn\u0027t low-level, just complacent. \u0027The actions you\u0027re taking are still a provocation,\u0027 she said to him evenly. \u0027The Night Watch is certain that the Maverick isn\u0027t Anton.\u0027 \u0027Who, then?\u0027 \u0027An untrained Light Magician unknown to us. A Light Magician controlled by the Dark Ones.\u0027 \u0027But what for?\u0027 the magician asked, genuinely surprised. \u0027Explain it to me. Why would we let our own people be killed, even those who are less valuable?\u0027 \u0027Yes, \"less valuable\" is the key phrase,\u0027 Tiger Cub replied in a melancholy tone. \u0027Maybe, just maybe, if we had a chance to eliminate the leader of the Light Ones in Moscow but, as usual, he\u0027s above all suspicion. And sacrifice twenty of our own just for one ordinary, average Light One? No way. Or do you think we\u0027re idiots?\u0027 \u0027No, I think you\u0027re very clever. Probably much cleverer than me.\u0027 Tiger Cub smiled her dangerous smile. \u0027But I\u0027m only a field operative. Conclusions will be drawn by someone else, and they will be drawn, you can be sure!\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not demanding immediate execution!\u0027 the Dark One said with a smile. \u0027Even now we don\u0027t exclude the possibility of error. A tribunal, a professional, impartial investigation, justice – that\u0027s all we want.\u0027 \u0027But isn\u0027t it strange that your leader couldn\u0027t hit Anton with Shahab\u0027s Lash?\u0027 said Tiger Cub, tilting a glass of beer with one finger. \u0027It\u0027s extraordinary. His favourite weapon, one he\u0027s been a master of for hundreds of years. Almost as if the Day Watch wasn\u0027t really interested in seeing Anton caught.\u0027 \u0027My dear girl,\u0027 said the Dark Magician, leaning across the table, \u0027you\u0027re being inconsistent. You can\u0027t accuse us of pursuing an innocent, law-abiding Light One and at the same time claim we\u0027re not trying to catch him!\u0027 \u0027Why not?\u0027 \u0027Such petty sadism.\u0027 The magician laughed. \u0027I\u0027m genuinely enjoying this conversation. Do you really think we\u0027re a gang of crazy, bloodthirsty psychopaths?\u0027 \u0027No, we think you\u0027re a gang of cunning creeps.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s try comparing our methods.\u0027 I could see the Dark One was mounting hobby horse. \u0027Let\u0027s compare the losses the actions of the two Watches have inflicted on ordinary people, our food base.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s only for you that humans are food.\u0027 \u0027What about you? Or are Light Ones born to Light Ones now and not picked out of the crowd?\u0027 \u0027For us, humans are our roots. Our roots.\u0027 \u0027Okay, call them roots. What\u0027s the point of arguing over words? But in that case they\u0027re our roots too. And it\u0027s no secret that the amount of sap they feed us is increasing.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s no secret that our numbers aren\u0027t declining either.\u0027 \u0027Of course. Troubled times, all that stress and tension – people are living on the edge and it\u0027s easy to fall off. At least we\u0027re able to agree on that!\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Tiger Cub agreed. She didn\u0027t look in my direction again and the conversation wandered off. I realised that Tiger Cub had told me everything she needed to. Or everything she felt it was appropriate to tell me. I picked up the mug of beer standing in front of me and drank it in several deep, measured swallows. I really had been thirsty. So the hunt was just a front? Yes, and I\u0027d realised that a long time ago. But it was important for me to know that our side understood that too. And the Maverick hadn\u0027t been caught? Naturally. Otherwise they would already have contacted me. Either by phone or mentally, that was no problem for the boss. The killer would have been handed over to the tribunal, Svetlana would no longer be torn between the desire to help and the need to avoid getting drawn into a fight, and I could have laughed in Zabulon\u0027s face. But how was it possible to find a single man in an immense city like this, when his powers manifested themselves spontaneously? Just flared up and then faded away again. Lying dormant between one killing and the next, one pointless victory over Evil and the next. And if he really was known to the Dark Ones, it was a secret kept by the very top bosses. Not by the Dark Ones who were wasting their time up here. I looked around in disgust. This wasn\u0027t serious! The guard I\u0027d killed so easily. The third-grade magician debating so keenly with our observer and not bothering to keep his eyes open. Those young guys at the terminals, shouting out: \u0027Tsvetnoi Boulevard has been checked!\u0027 \u0027Polezhaevskaya Street is under surveillance!\u0027 Yes, this was a field headquarters. And it was about as ludicrously unprofessional as the inexperienced Dark Ones hunting for me right across the city. Yes, the net had been cast, but no one was concerned about the gaping holes in it. The longer I could keep on dodging the round-up and the more I thrashed about, the more the Dark liked it. At the strategic level, of course. Svetlana wouldn\u0027t be able to bear it, she\u0027d lose control. She\u0027d try to help, because she could sense the genuine power developing inside her. None of our people would be able to restrain her – not directly. And she\u0027d be killed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-45.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
