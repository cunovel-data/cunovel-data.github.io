And she\u0027s got big things ahead of her, not like you and me.\u0027\n \u0027You tried your best, did you?\u0027\n \u0027What kind of question\u0027s that?\u0027 said Ignat, offended. \u0027Come round some time, it\u0027d be good to see you.\u0027\n The gin had turned warm, the ice in the glass had melted. I shook my head and put the glass down.\n Gesar, you can\u0027t foresee everything.\n But to fight you – not in a duel of magic, that would just be ridiculous – to fight you in the only arena where I have a chance, in words and actions, I have to know what you want. I have to know how the cards lie in the deck. And what you\u0027re holding in your hand.\n Who were the players?\n Gesar, the originator and organiser. Olga, his lover and consultant, a sorceress punished for some crime. Svetlana, who had to complete the mission and was being prepared with great care. Me, one of the instruments of her education. Ignat, Tiger Cub, Semyon and all the other Light Ones could be left out of my calculations. They were instruments too, but only secondary ones. And I couldn\u0027t count on them for support.\n The Dark Ones?\n Naturally they were involved, but not in any obvious way. Zabulon and his henchmen were concerned about Svetlana\u0027s appearance in our camp. They couldn\u0027t do anything openly right now. But they could try to sabotage things on the sly or prepare a crushing blow that would bring the Watches to the brink of war.\n What else?\n The Inquisition?\n I drummed my fingers on the armrest of the lounger.\n The Inquisition. The structure that oversees the Watches. It reviews disputes and punishes those who violate the Treaty – from either side. It is always vigilant. It collects data on every one of us. But it only intervenes in extremely rare cases and its strength lies more in secrecy than in battle. When the Inquisition considers a case involving a powerful magician, it drafts in fighters from both Watches.\n But the Inquisition was involved somehow. I knew the boss. He squeezed the last drop from every opportunity. And the recent business with Maxim, the Maverick Other, the Light One who had gone to work for the Inquisition, was a good example. The boss had made use of the incident to train Svetlana and teach her the lessons of self-control and intrigue, but at the same time he\u0027d discovered a new Inquisitor.\n I wished I knew what they were preparing Svetlana for.\n So far I was groping in the dark. And the worst thing of all was that the gulf between me and Sveta was getting wider and wider.\n I put on the earphones and closed my eyes.\n Tonight the fern will unfold its miraculous flower,\n Tonight the spirits will come back home,\n Clouds from the north, wind from the west,\n Soon the enchantress will wave her hand to me.\n I live waiting for a miracle, like a Mauser in its holster,\n Like a spider in its web,\n Like a tree in the desert,\n Like a black fox in its hole.\n I was taking a risk, a serious risk. Great Magicians become great by trampling over their own kind, but even they don\u0027t dare go against their own. Isolated individuals don\u0027t survive.\n I was running through the telescopes, away from the frightened eyes of children,\n I wanted to sleep with a mermaid, but I didn\u0027t know how to act with her,\n I wanted to turn into a streetcar and drive through your window.\n The wind blows from the borderlands, we don\u0027t care any more,\n The wind blows from the borderlands, we don\u0027t care any more.\n Be my shadow, my squeaking stair, my bright-coloured Sunday, my sunshine with rain,\n Be my god, my birch-tree sap, my electric current, my bent rifle.\n I can bear witness that you are the wind, you blow in my face and I laugh,\n I do not wish to leave you without a battle, since you dream of me.\n Be my shadow . . .\n I felt a hand on my shoulder.\n \u0027Good morning, Sveta,\u0027 I said and opened my eyes.\n She was wearing shorts over a swimsuit. Her hair was wet and neat. She must have taken a shower. While I, being a filthy pig, hadn\u0027t even thought of taking one.\n \u0027How are you after yesterday?\u0027 she asked.\n \u0027Okay. And you?\u0027\n \u0027All right,\u0027 she said and turned away.\n I waited. With Spleen playing in my earphones.\n \u0027What were you expecting from me?\u0027 Sveta asked sharply. \u0027I\u0027m a normal, healthy young woman. I haven\u0027t had a man since last winter. I realise you\u0027ve got it into your head that Gesar threw us together, like mating horses, so you\u0027re just being stubborn.\u0027\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t expecting anything.\u0027\n \u0027Then I\u0027m sorry you got a surprise!\u0027\n \u0027Did you sense me in the room? When you woke up?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 Svetlana awkwardly pulled a packet of cigarettes out of her pocket and lit one. \u0027I\u0027m tired. Maybe I am still only learning, and not working yet, but I\u0027m tired. And I came here to relax.\u0027\n \u0027You were the one who started talking about everyone faking a good time . . .\u0027\n \u0027And you were only too happy to agree.\u0027\n \u0027True.\u0027 I nodded.\n \u0027And then you went off to knock back vodka and organise conspiracies.\u0027\n \u0027What conspiracies?\u0027\n \u0027Against Gesar. And against me, by the way. How absurd! Even I sensed it! Don\u0027t get the idea you\u0027re some Great Magician who can—\u0027\n She stopped short. But too late.\n \u0027I\u0027m not a Great Magician,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027m third grade. Maybe second, but no higher than that. We all have limits of our own that we can\u0027t go beyond, not even if we live for a thousand years.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to offend you,\u0027 Svetlana said, embarrassed. She lowered the hand holding the cigarette.\n \u0027Forget it. I\u0027ve got nothing to be offended at. Do you know why the Dark Ones form families from their own kind so often, and we prefer to choose our wives and husbands from among ordinary people? The Dark Ones find it easier to cope with inequality and constant competition.\u0027\n \u0027A human being and an Other – that\u0027s even more unequal.\u0027\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t count. We\u0027re two different species. That means nothing counts.\u0027\n \u0027I want you to know,\u0027 said Svetlana, taking a deep drag on her cigarette, \u0027that I wasn\u0027t intending to let things go so far. I was waiting for you to come down and see us and get jealous.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t know I was supposed to get jealous.\u0027\n \u0027And then everything just went crazy and I couldn\u0027t help myself\n \u0027I understand everything, Sveta. It\u0027s okay.\u0027\n She looked at me in confusion.\n \u0027Okay?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, it happens to everyone. The Watch is one big, tight-knit family. With everything that follows from that.\u0027\n \u0027What a bastard you are!\u0027 Svetlana exclaimed. \u0027Anton, if only you could see yourself now from the outside! How did you ever end up on our side?\u0027\n \u0027Sveta, you came to make up, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 I asked. \u0027So I\u0027m making up. It\u0027s all okay. Nothing counts. That\u0027s life, all sorts of things happen.\u0027\n She jumped to her feet and glared icily at me for a second. I started blinking rapidly.\n \u0027You idiot!\u0027 Svetlana blurted out and went back into the house.\n So what had she been expecting? Hurt feelings, accusations, sadness?\n But more importantly, what had Gesar been expecting? What would change if I stopped playing the role of Sveta\u0027s ill-starred lover? Would someone else take on the role? Or was it already time for her to be left alone – all alone with her great destiny?\n The goal. I had to know what Gesar\u0027s goal was.\n I sprang up off the lounger and walked into the house. I immediately spotted Olga, alone in the sitting room. Standing in front of the open display case, holding out a sword with a long, narrow blade in front of her. She wasn\u0027t looking at it the way you look at an antique toy. Tiger Cub probably looked at her swords in the same kind of way. But her love of old weapons was in the abstract; Olga\u0027s wasn\u0027t.\n When Gesar came to live and work in Russia – because of her, by the way – swords like that might still have been in use.\n But eighty years ago, when Olga had been deprived of all her rights, wars were already fought differently.\n A former Great Sorceress. A former Great Goal. Eighty years.\n \u0027It\u0027s all so well planned, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 I said.\n Olga started and swung round.\n \u0027We can\u0027t defeat the Dark ourselves. The little people have to be enlightened first. Become kind and loving, industrious and intelligent. So that every Other can see nothing but the Light. What a great goal it was, how long the ripples lasted when it was drowned in blood.\u0027\n \u0027You figured it out after all,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027Or did you just guess?\u0027\n \u0027I guessed.\u0027\n \u0027Good. Now what?\u0027\n \u0027How did you slip up, Olga?\u0027\n \u0027I accepted a compromise. A little compromise with the Dark. And the result was that we lost.\u0027\n \u0027We did? We\u0027ll always survive. Adapt, fit in, find our place. And we\u0027ll carry on the old struggle. It\u0027s only humans who lose.\u0027\n \u0027Retreats are inevitable sometimes,\u0027 said Olga, gripping the double-handed sword easily in one hand and swinging it above her head. \u0027Do I look like a helicopter with its rotors idling?\u0027\n \u0027You look like a woman waving a sword around. Do we really never learn anything, Olga?\u0027\n \u0027Sure we do. This time everything\u0027s going to be different, Anton.\u0027\n \u0027A new revolution?\u0027\n \u0027We didn\u0027t want the last one. It was all supposed to happen almost completely without bloodshed. You understand: we can only win through ordinary humans. When they become enlightened, when their spirit is raised up. Communism was a wonderfully well-calculated system, and it\u0027s all my fault that it wasn\u0027t realised.\u0027\n \u0027So why aren\u0027t you in the Twilight already, if it\u0027s all your fault?\u0027\n \u0027Because everything had been agreed. Every step approved. Even that disastrous compromise, even that seemed acceptable.\u0027\n \u0027And now – a new attempt to change people?\u0027\n \u0027One more in the series.\u0027\n \u0027Why here?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Why in Russia again?\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027How much more of this does our country have to put up with?\u0027\n \u0027As much as it takes.\u0027\n \u0027Come on – why here again?\u0027\n Olga sighed, deftly slipped the sword back into its scabbard and put it back on its stand. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-61.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
