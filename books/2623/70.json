The boss ignored the jibe. \u0027Anton, what degree of magical intervention are you allowed?\u0027 Ah, of course, he knew about my deal with Zabulon. \u0027Second.\u0027 \u0027You can stop the hurricane,\u0027 said Gesar. A simple statement of fact. \u0027Reduce it to no more than a cloudburst. You\u0027ve collected enough power.\u0027 The wind sprang up again. And this time it wasn\u0027t going to stop. It tore and tugged at us, as if it had decided to blow us all off the roof. The rain began to lash down. \u0027It looks like your last chance,\u0027 the boss added. \u0027But then, it\u0027s up to you.\u0027 The defensive shield sprang up around him with a glassy tinkling sound. It was the first time I\u0027d seen a magician use such defensive measures against the ordinary excesses of the elements. Svetlana carried on drawing the Book of Destiny, with her dress billowing out around her. Egor didn\u0027t move a muscle, as if he was crucified on an invisible cross. Maybe he couldn\u0027t see or understand what was going on. What happens to someone when his old destiny is taken away and he still hasn\u0027t been given a new one? \u0027Gesar, the typhoon you\u0027re about to unleash will make this storm look like nothing,\u0027 I shouted. The wind almost drowned out my words. \u0027That\u0027s inevitable,\u0027 Gesar replied. He seemed to be speaking in a whisper, but every word was perfectly clear. \u0027It\u0027s already happening.\u0027 The Book of Destiny had become visible even in the human world. Of course, Svetlana hadn\u0027t been drawing it in the literal sense of the word, she\u0027d been extracting it from the deepest levels of the Twilight. Making a copy, so that any changes she made in it would be reflected in the original. The Book of Destiny looked like a model, a replica, made out of fiery threads of flame hanging motionless in the air. The raindrops sizzled when they touched it. And now Svetlana would start changing Egor\u0027s destiny. And later, decades later, Egor would change the destiny of the world. As always, trying to shift it towards the Good. And, as always, failing. I staggered. In a single instant, completely without warning, the strong wind had become a hurricane. The scene around me was incredible. I saw cars stop on the avenue up close against the kerb – as far away as possible from the trees. A huge advertising hoarding collapsed on to an intersection without a single sound – the roaring of the wind completely drowned out the crash. A few little figures made a belated dash for the buildings, as if they hoped to find shelter by the walls. Svetlana stopped. The red-hot coal was still glowing in her hand. \u0027Anton!\u0027 I could hardly make out what she was saying. \u0027Anton, what should I do? Tell me, Anton, should I do this?\u0027 The chalk circle was protecting her but not completely – the clothes were still being torn off her body – but at least it allowed her to stay on her feet. Everything else seemed to have disappeared. I looked at her, and at the glowing piece of chalk, already poised to change another person\u0027s destiny. Svetlana was waiting for an answer, but I had nothing to say to her. Because I didn\u0027t know the answer either. I lifted my arms up towards the raging heavens. I saw the spectral blossoms of power in my hands. \u0027Can you handle it?\u0027 Zabulon asked sympathetically. \u0027The storm\u0027s quite wild already.\u0027 Even through the clamour of the hurricane, I could hear his voice as clearly as the boss\u0027s. Gesar sighed. I opened my hands and turned the palms towards the sky – the sky where there were no stars, the sky full of dark roiling clouds, torrents of rain, flashes of lightning. It was one of the simplest spells. Almost the first one everybody was taught. Remoralisation. Without any limiting conditions. \u0027Don\u0027t do that!\u0027 Gesar shouted. \u0027Don\u0027t you dare!\u0027 In one swift movement he dashed across to shield Svetlana and Egor from me. As if that could stop the spell. There was nothing that could stop it now. A ray of light that humans couldn\u0027t see shot from my open hands. It was the scraps that I\u0027d gathered so mercilessly from all those people. The scarlet flame of roses, the pale pink of peonies, the yellow glow of asters, white daisies and almost black orchids. Zabulon laughed quietly behind my back. Svetlana stood there, holding the chalk poised over the Book of Destiny. Egor was frozen in front of her, with his arms flung out. Pieces on a chess board. The power was in my hands. I\u0027d never had so much power. It was overflowing, I could direct it at anyone. I smiled at Svetlana. And very slowly raised my palms with their fountain of rainbow light towards my own face. \u0027No!\u0027 Zabulon\u0027s howl didn\u0027t cut through the roar of the hurricane, it completely drowned it. A bolt of lightning flashed across the sky. The leader of the Dark Ones rushed towards me, but Gesar stepped out to meet him, and the Dark Magician stopped. I didn\u0027t really see all this, I felt it. My face was enveloped in the shimmering colours. My head was spinning. I couldn\u0027t feel the wind any more. There was nothing left except a rainbow, a never-ending rainbow, and I was drowning in it. The wind raged all around me without touching me. I looked at Sveta and heard the invisible wall that had always separated us breaking down. Breaking down and forming a protective barrier around us. Her fluttering hair settled gently around her face. \u0027Did you use it all on yourself?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027Everything you collected?\u0027 She still couldn\u0027t believe it. Svetlana knew what the price for borrowed power was. \u0027All of it,\u0027 I answered. I had an incredibly light feeling. \u0027Why?\u0027 The sorceress held out her hand towards me. \u0027Why, Anton? When you could have stopped this storm? You could have brought happiness to thousands of people. How could you use it all on yourself?\u0027 \u0027In order to avoid making a mistake,\u0027 I explained. I felt slightly embarrassed that a Great Sorceress like her didn\u0027t understand such a minor detail. Svetlana said nothing for a moment. Then she glanced at the piece of chalk glowing in her hand. \u0027What should I do, Anton?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve already opened the Book of Destiny.\u0027 \u0027Anton! Who\u0027s right? Gesar or you?\u0027 I shook my head. \u0027You decide for yourself.\u0027 Svetlana frowned. \u0027Anton, is that all? Why did you take so much Light from others? What have you wasted your second-degree magic on?\u0027 \u0027Listen to me,\u0027 I said, not sure how much conviction there was in my voice. Even now I wasn\u0027t entirely convinced myself. \u0027Sometimes the most important thing isn\u0027t to do something. Sometimes it\u0027s more important not to do anything. Some things you have to decide for yourself, without any advice. From me, or Gesar, or Zabulon, or the Light or the Dark. All on your own.\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027No!\u0027 \u0027Yes. You must decide for yourself. And nobody can relieve you of that responsibility. And whatever you do – you\u0027ll always regret what you didn\u0027t do.\u0027 \u0027Anton, I love you!\u0027 \u0027I know. And I love you. That\u0027s why I won\u0027t say anything.\u0027 \u0027And you call that love?\u0027 \u0027There isn\u0027t any other kind.\u0027 \u0027I need your advice!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027Anton, I need your advice!\u0027 \u0027We all create our own destinies,\u0027 I said. It was rather more than I ought to have said. \u0027Decide.\u0027 The piece of chalk in her hand flared up in a slim needle of fire as she turned back to the Book of Destiny. She swept her hand through the air and I heard the pages rustling under the blindingly bright eraser. Light and Dark are only spots on the pages of destiny. A flourish of the hand. A rapid stroke. Words of fire streaming across the page. Svetlana opened her fingers and the chalk of Destiny fell at her feet. As heavily as if it were a lead bullet. The hurricane tumbled it across the roof, but I managed to bend down and put my hand over it. The Book of Destiny started to dissolve. Egor staggered, doubled over and fell on his side, with his knees pulled up to his chest, curled up into a pitiful little bundle. The white circle around them had been washed away by the rain, and I could walk over to them now. I squatted down and took hold of the boy\u0027s shoulders. \u0027You didn\u0027t write anything!\u0027 Gesar shouted. \u0027Svetlana, you only erased things!\u0027 The sorceress shrugged. She looked down at me. The rain had already broken through the fading barrier and soaked her white dress, transforming it into transparent muslin that no longer concealed the form of her body. A moment earlier Svetlana had been a priestess in white robes, and now she was a young woman soaked to the skin, standing in the eye of a storm with her arms helplessly at her sides. \u0027That was your test,\u0027 Gesar said to her in a quiet voice. \u0027You\u0027ve missed your chance.\u0027 \u0027Light One Gesar, I do not wish to serve in the Watch,\u0027 the young woman replied. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Light One Gesar, but it is not my path. Not my destiny.\u0027 Gesar shook his head sadly. Zabulon came across to us with a few quick steps. \u0027Is that it?\u0027 the Dark Magician asked. He looked at me, at Sveta, at Egor. \u0027Didn\u0027t you do anything?\u0027 He looked at the Inquisitor, who raised his head and nodded. Nobody answered him. A crooked smile spread across Zabulon\u0027s face. \u0027All that effort, and it\u0027s all ended in a farce. And all because a hysterical girl didn\u0027t want to leave her indecisive lover. Anton, I\u0027m disappointed in you. Svetlana, I\u0027m delighted with you. Gesar,\u0027 – the Dark Magician looked at the boss – \u0027my congratulations on having such remarkable people on your staff.\u0027 A portal opened behind Zabulon\u0027s back. He laughed quietly as he stepped into the black cloud. I heard a heavy sigh rising up from the ground. Although I couldn\u0027t see, I knew what was happening. One after another the members of the Day Watch were emerging from the Twilight and racing to their cars to move them as far away as possible from the trees. Or hunching over and running to the nearest buildings. After them the Light Magicians abandoned the cordon. Some for the same simple, human reasons. But I knew that most of them stayed where they were, looking up at the roof of the building. Tiger Cub, wearing a guilty expression just in case. Semyon, with the gloomy smile of an Other who\u0027d seen worse storms than this one. Ignat with his eternal expression of sincere sympathy. \u0027I couldn\u0027t do it,\u0027 said Svetlana. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Gesar. I couldn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027You never could have,\u0027 I said. \u0027And you were never meant to.\u0027 I opened my hand and looked at the little piece of chalk, which while I held it was no more than that – a wet, sticky piece of chalk. Pointed at one end. Broken off unevenly at the other. \u0027How long ago did you realise?\u0027 asked Gesar. He came across and sat down beside me. His shield extended to cover us and the roar of the hurricane faded away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-70.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
