{"id":101348,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Probably he was. I\u0027d asked a straight question and been given a straight answer. Of course, as the years go by, even the most Light of magicians acquire a certain degree of cynicism and learn to play tricks with words. But the consequences of a direct lie would be too serious even for Boris Ignatievich.\\n\\n I reached the entry lobby and its electronic security systems. Magicians tend to regard technology with disdain, and Semyon had once shown me how easy it was to fool the voice analyser and the iris scanner. But I\u0027d gone ahead and bought these expensive toys anyway. Maybe they were no protection against an Other, but it seemed entirely possible that one day the guys from the Federal Security Service or the mafia would decide to check us out.\\n\\n \u0027One, two, three, four, five . . .\u0027 I muttered into the microphone, gazing into the camera lens at the same time. The electronic circuits pondered for a few seconds, then a green light came on above the door.\\n\\n There was no one in the first room, where the server\u0027s cooling fans were humming gently. The air conditioners built into the wall were huffing and puffing, but it was still hot in there. And spring had only just begun . . .\\n\\n I didn\u0027t go into the system analysts\u0027 lab, just walked straight through into my own office. It wasn\u0027t all mine. Tolik, my deputy, worked here too. Sometimes he lived here, spending the nights on an old leather sofa.\\n\\n He was sitting at his desk, thoughtfully inspecting an old motherboard.\\n\\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 I said, sitting down on the sofa. The disk was burning my hands.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a goner,\u0027 Tolik said gloomily.\\n\\n \u0027Bin it then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let me just take its brain out first.\u0027 Tolik was thrifty, a habit acquired from years of working in state-financed institutions. We had no financial problems, but he carefully stockpiled all the old hardware anyway, even if it was of no use to anyone. \u0027Would you believe it, I\u0027ve been fiddling around with this for half an hour, and it\u0027s still dead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a prehistoric antique, why waste time fiddling around with it? Even the technology in accounts is more up to date.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I could give it to someone . . . Maybe I should take the cache out too . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tolik, we\u0027ve got an urgent job to do,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Uh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look . . .\u0027 I held up the disk. \u0027This is a dossier ... a complete dossier on four members of the Watch. Including the boss.\u0027\\n\\n Tolik opened the drawer of his desk, put the motherboard in it and stared at the disk.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. I\u0027m going to go through three of them. And you\u0027re going to go through the fourth . . . mine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are we looking for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This,\u0027 I said, holding up the briefing notes. \u0027It\u0027s possible that one of the suspects may be carrying out sporadic killings of Dark Ones. Unauthorised killings. All the known incidents are listed here. We have to either eliminate this possibility, or . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, so it really is you who\u0027s killing them, then?\u0027 Tolik asked. \u0027Pardon my irony.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. But don\u0027t take my word for it. Let\u0027s get on with it.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even look at the information about me, just downloaded all eight hundred megabytes on to Tolik\u0027s computer and took out the disk.\\n\\n \u0027Shall I tell you if I come across anything really interesting?\u0027 Tolik asked. I glanced across at him as he started looking through the text files, tugging on his left ear and clicking regularly with his mouse.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s up to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n I started with the materials on the boss. First there was an introductory section – background information. Every line I read brought me out in a sweat.\\n\\n Of course, even this dossier didn\u0027t give the boss\u0027s real name and origins. Facts like that weren\u0027t kept on file anywhere for Others of his rank. But even so there was so much that I didn\u0027t know. Starting with the fact that the boss was older than I\u0027d thought. At least a hundred and fifty years older. And that meant he\u0027d been personally involved in drawing up the Treaty between Light and Dark. I was intrigued by the thought that all the other magicians still surviving from that time held positions in the central office and weren\u0027t stuck in the exhausting and tedious post of regional director.\\n\\n Apart from that, I recognised a few of the names under which the boss had figured in the history of the Watch, and learnt where he was born. We\u0027d wondered about that sometimes, and even placed bets on it, always pointing to \u0027indisputable\u0027 proof. But somehow no one had ever suspected that Boris Ignatievich was born in Tibet.\\n\\n And even in my wildest dreams, I could never have imagined whose mentor he had been.\\n\\n The boss had been working in Europe since the fifteenth century. From indirect references, I inferred that the reason for this move was a woman. I could even guess who it was.\\n\\n I closed the introductory window and looked over at Tolik. He was watching some video footage. Of course, my biographical details were less fascinating than the boss\u0027s. I glanced at the small moving picture and blushed.\\n\\n \u0027For the first incident you have a solid alibi,\u0027 Tolik said without turning round.\\n\\n \u0027Listen . . .\u0027 I was lost for words.\\n\\n \u0027Okay, okay. I\u0027ll fast-forward it, to check the entire night. . .\u0027\\n\\n I imagined what the recording would look like at high speed and turned away. I\u0027d always suspected the boss kept tabs on his colleagues, especially the young ones. But not that cynically!\\n\\n \u0027The alibi won\u0027t be that solid,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027ll get dressed and go out any moment now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can see that,\u0027 Tolik confirmed.\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027ll be gone for almost an hour and a half. I was looking for champagne . . . and while I was looking, I sobered up a bit in the fresh air. Started wondering if it was worth going back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 said Tolik. \u0027You watch the boss\u0027s private life.\u0027\\n\\n Half an hour later, I realised Tolik was right. Maybe I had good reason to feel offended by the observers\u0027 invasion of my privacy. But Boris Ignatievich had as much reason as I did.\\n\\n \u0027The boss has an alibi,\u0027 I said. \u0027Indisputable. For two incidents he has four witnesses. And for one – almost the entire Watch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was that the hunt for that Dark One who went crazy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, in theory, you could have killed the Dark Ones. Quite easily. And I\u0027m sorry, Anton, but every one of the killings happens when you\u0027re in an excited state. As if you weren\u0027t completely in control of yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I believe you. What shall I do with the file?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Delete it.\u0027\\n\\n Tolik thought for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have anything valuable on here. I think I\u0027ll run a low-level format. The disk\u0027s long overdue for a clean-out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks.\u0027 I closed the dossier on the boss. \u0027That\u0027s it, I\u0027ll deal with the others myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 said Tolik as he overcame the computer\u0027s righteous indignation and it began digesting itself.\\n\\n \u0027Go check on the girls,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027And look disapproving for a change. I\u0027m sure they\u0027re playing cards in there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All in a day\u0027s work, I suppose,\u0027 Tolik agreed. \u0027When will you be through here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In a couple of hours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll call in.\u0027\\n\\n He went off to our \u0027girls\u0027, two young programmers who dealt with the Watch\u0027s official activity. I carried on working. Semyon was next.\\n\\n Two and a half hours later I tore my eyes away from the computer, massaged the back of my neck with my palms – it always cramps up when I sit there hunched over the terminal like that – and turned on the coffee machine.\\n\\n Neither the boss, nor Ilya, nor Semyon could be the unhinged killer of Dark Ones. They all had alibis – and some of them were absolutely watertight. For instance, Semyon had managed to spend the entire night of one of the murders negotiating with the senior management of the Day Watch. Ilya had been on secondment in Sakhalin – they\u0027d screwed things up so badly over there that they\u0027d needed back-up from Moscow . . .\\n\\n I was the only one left under suspicion.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t trust Tolik, but I went through the data again anyway. It was all very clear. Not a single alibi.\\n\\n The coffee was disgusting, sour, the filter couldn\u0027t have been changed for ages. I gulped down the hot swill, staring at the screen, then took out my mobile and dialled the boss\u0027s number.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n He always knew who was calling him.\\n\\n \u0027Boris Ignatievich, only one of the four can be suspected.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which one?\u0027\\n\\n The boss\u0027s voice was dry and official. But somehow I suddenly got this picture of him sitting half-naked on a leather sofa, with a glass of champagne in one hand and Olga\u0027s hand in the other, holding the phone in place with his shoulder, or levitating it beside his ear . . .\\n\\n \u0027Tut-tut,\u0027 the boss rebuked me. \u0027You lousy clairvoyant. So who\u0027s under suspicion?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You knew it,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There was no need to get me to process that dossier. You could have done it yourself. That means you wanted me to be convinced of the danger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That could be,\u0027 the boss said with a sigh. \u0027What are you going to do, Anton?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Start packing my bag for jail.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come round to my office. In ... er ... in ten minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay.\u0027 I switched off my phone.\\n\\n First I went to see how the programmers were doing. Tolik was still there with them, and they were hard at work.\\n\\n The Watch didn\u0027t really have any need for these two worthless workers. Their security clearance was low, so we still had to do almost everything ourselves. But where else could we find work for two sorceresses as low-level as these two? If only they\u0027d have agreed to live ordinary lives. . . but no, they wanted the \u0027romance\u0027 of working for the Watch ... So we\u0027d invented jobs for them.\\n\\n They mostly just whiled away the time, surfing the net and playing games, their favourites being various kinds of patience.\\n\\n Tolik was at one of the spare PCs – we had plenty of hardware around the place. Yulia was sitting very close to him, twitching her mouse around on its mat.\\n\\n \u0027Is that what you call computer skills training?\u0027 I asked, gazing at the monsters hurtling round the screen.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing better than computer games for improving skill with the mouse,\u0027 Tolik replied innocently.\\n\\n \u0027Well . . .\u0027 I couldn\u0027t think of any response.\\n\\n It was a long time since I\u0027d played video games. The same went for most other members of the Watch. Killing evil vermin in a cartoon became less interesting once you\u0027d met it face to face. Unless, that is, you\u0027d already lived a couple of hundred years and built up reserves of cynicism, like Olga . . .\\n\\n \u0027Tolik, I probably won\u0027t be back in today,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Uhuh.\u0027 He nodded, without any sign of surprise. None of us has really strong powers of prevision, but we sense little things like that immediately. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-31.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
