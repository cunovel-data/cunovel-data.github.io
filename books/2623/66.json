I wondered how many pupils he\u0027d had who\u0027d failed to acknowledge his supreme goals and noble ideals.\\n\\n Hundreds, thousands.\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Gesar,\u0027 I said. I glanced at Alisher. \u0027I wish you luck, new watchman.\u0027\\n\\n The young man looked at me reproachfully:\\n\\n \u0027If I may be allowed to say something. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Say it,\u0027 I told him.\\n\\n \u0027In your place, I would not be in any hurry, Light One Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve already lost too much time, Light One Alisher,\u0027 I said with a smile. I was used to thinking of myself as one of the most junior magicians in the Watch, but everything passes. And to this novice I was an authority. For the time being at least. \u0027One day you will hear the sound of time rustling as it slips through your fingers like sand. Remember me then. I wish you luck.\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER 6\\n\\n HEAT.\\n\\n I was walking along Old Arbat Street. Artists sketching cartoon portraits, musicians playing hackneyed music, street traders all selling the same souvenirs, foreigners with the typical look of interest in their eyes, Muscovites in their usual irritated mood rushing past the stalls of sham craftwork.\\n\\n Should I shake you all up a bit?\\n\\n Should I put on a little show for you?\\n\\n Juggle a few bolts of lightning? Swallow genuine fire? Make the paving stones open up to reveal a fountain of mineral water? Heal a dozen crippled beggars? Feed the homeless urchins darting around with cakes conjured up out of thin air?\\n\\n What would the point be?\\n\\n They\u0027d toss me a handful of small change for the fireballs that should be used to kill creatures of Evil. The mineral water fountain would turn out to be a broken water main. These crippled beggars are already healthier and richer than most of the people walking by. And the homeless urchins would run for it, because they learned a long time ago that there\u0027s no such thing as free cake.\\n\\n Yes, I could understand Gesar, I could understand all the higher magicians who\u0027d been fighting against the Dark for thousands of years. You can\u0027t live for ever with a feeling of powerlessness. You can\u0027t carry on sitting in the trenches for ever: that kills an army more surely than enemy bullets.\\n\\n But how did I come into it?\\n\\n Did the banner of victory really have to be sewn out of the fabric of my love?\\n\\n And how did these humans come into it?\\n\\n Turning the world upside down and then turning it back again was easy enough, but who\u0027d stop all the people from falling off?\\n\\n Were we really incapable of learning anything?\\n\\n I knew what Gesar was planning to do, or rather, what Svetlana was going to do on his instructions. I knew how it might turn out and I could even imagine which loopholes in the Treaty would be used to justify interference with the Book of Destiny. I had been told when the act would be performed. The only thing I didn\u0027t know was where and whose destiny was to be changed.\\n\\n And that was a fatal gap in my knowledge.\\n\\n Almost fatal enough to make me pay Zabulon a visit.\\n\\n But then I\u0027d be dispatched into the Twilight.\\n\\n I was halfway along the Old Arbat when I sensed a surge of power – very faint, at the very limits of my sensitivity. There was magical activity taking place somewhere very close, not very strong, but even so . . .\\n\\n The Dark!\\n\\n Whatever I might think about Gesar, no matter how much I disagreed with him, I was still a soldier of the Night Watch.\\n\\n I reached into my pocket for my amulet, summoned my shadow and stepped into the Twilight.\\n\\n Oh, how neglected everything was!\\n\\n It was a long time since I\u0027d walked round the centre of Moscow in the Twilight.\\n\\n Everything was covered with a thick carpet of blue moss. The slow oscillations of its threads created an illusion of trembling water. Ripples ran from where I was standing as the moss simultaneously drank in my emotions and tried to creep away from me. But I wasn\u0027t interested in the Twilight\u0027s little pranks right now.\\n\\n I was not alone in the grey space under that sunless sky.\\n\\n I looked for a second at the girl standing with her back to me and I could feel a wicked smile spreading across my face. A smile unworthy of a Light Magician. Some \u0027moderate intervention\u0027 this was!\\n\\n A third-degree magical intervention?\\n\\n Well, well.\\n\\n That\u0027s very serious, my girl. So serious, you must be crazy. Third degree\u0027s way beyond your powers, you must be using someone else\u0027s amulet.\\n\\n But I\u0027ll use my own powers to investigate.\\n\\n I walked up to her and she didn\u0027t even hear my steps on the soft blue carpet of moss. The vague, shadowy forms of humans were sliding past us, and she was too absorbed in what she was doing.\\n\\n \u0027Anton Gorodetsky, Night Watch,\u0027 I said. \u0027Alisa Donnikova, you\u0027re under arrest.\u0027\\n\\n The young witch screeched and swung round. She was holding an amulet in her hand, a crystal prism through which she had been viewing the people walking by. Her first instinct was to try to hide the amulet, then she tried to look at me through the prism.\\n\\n I grabbed her arm and forced her to stop. We stood close to each other for a second as I slowly increased the pressure, twisting the witch\u0027s wrist. A scene like that between a man and a woman would have looked shameful. But for us Others, physical strength doesn\u0027t depend on our sex, or even on how well developed our muscles are. Strength lies all around us – in the Twilight, in humans. I couldn\u0027t tell how much Alisa might have extracted from the world around her. It could be even more than I had.\\n\\n But I\u0027d caught her at the scene of the crime. And there could be other Watch members nearby. Resisting a member of the other Watch who had officially declared you under arrest was cause for immediate elimination.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not resisting,\u0027 said Alisa, and she opened her fingers. The prism fell into the soft moss, which swirled and seethed, enveloping the crystal amulet.\\n\\n \u0027The prism of power?\u0027 I asked rhetorically. \u0027Alisa Donnikova, you have performed a magical intervention of the third degree.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fourth,\u0027 she replied quickly.\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Third or fourth, that\u0027s of no real importance. It still means the tribunal, Alisa. You\u0027re in big trouble.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t do anything.\u0027 The witch was trying hard to look calm. \u0027I have personal permission to carry the prism. I didn\u0027t make use of it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Alisa, any higher magician can extract all the information needed from this thing.\u0027\\n\\n I reached down towards the ground, forcing the blue moss to part and the prism to leap into my hand. It was cold, very cold.\\n\\n \u0027Even I can read the history from it,\u0027 I said. \u0027Alisa Donnikova, Other, Dark Witch of the Day Patrol, fourth grade of power, I hereby formally accuse you of violating the Treaty. If you offer resistance I shall be obliged to eliminate you. Put your hands behind your back.\u0027\\n\\n She obeyed. And then she started talking, quickly and urgently, trying desperately to persuade me:\\n\\n \u0027Anton, wait, please, listen to me. Yes, I did try out the prism, but you must understand, it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever been trusted with such a powerful amulet! Anton, I\u0027m not so stupid as to attack people in the centre of Moscow, and why would I want to? Anton, we\u0027re both Others! Can\u0027t we settle this in a friendly way? Anton!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Friendly?\u0027 I said, putting the prism in my pocket. \u0027Come on, let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, a fourth-degree intervention, or third degree! Any third-degree intervention carried out in the interests of the Light! Not like my stupid game with the prism, a genuine intervention!\u0027\\n\\n I could understand why she was panicking. This business could easily end in dematerialisation. A Day Watch agent sucking the life out of humans for her own personal ends – that would be a tremendous scandal. They\u0027d hand Alisa over without the slightest hesitation.\\n\\n \u0027You have no authority to make such compromises. The leader of the Dark Ones will not ratify your promise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon will confirm it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will he?\u0027 I was shocked by the certainty in her voice. She was probably Zabulon\u0027s lover. But even so, it was surprising. \u0027Alisa, I once made a friendly agreement with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, and I was the one who suggested overlooking your intervention.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And do you remember how it all turned out?\u0027 I asked with a smile.\\n\\n \u0027This is different, I\u0027m the one who\u0027s broken the law,\u0027 said Alisa, lowering her eyes. \u0027You\u0027ll have the right to strike back. You don\u0027t need permission for third-degree Light magic, do you? Or for any Light magic? You could remoralise twenty vicious criminals and make them righteous. Incinerate ten murderers on the spot. Prevent a catastrophe, create a localised time warp! Anton, isn\u0027t that worth overlooking my stupid trick? Look around, everyone here\u0027s still alive! I hadn\u0027t done anything yet. I\u0027d only just started—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everything you say can be used against you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I know, I know!\u0027\\n\\n There were tears glittering in her eyes. Probably quite genuine ones too. Beneath her nature as a witch she was still a perfectly ordinary girl. A pretty girl frightened by the mistake she\u0027d made. And was it her fault that she\u0027d ended up on the side of the Dark?\\n\\n I felt my emotional shield starting to buckle and shook my head:\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t try to put pressure on me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton, please, let\u0027s settle this. Wouldn\u0027t you like the right to a third-degree intervention?\u0027\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t I just? It was every Light Magician\u0027s dream to be given carte blanche like that. Just for a moment to feel that he was fighting like a genuine soldier and not sitting in the trenches, being eaten by lice and gazing dejectedly at the white flag of truce.\\n\\n \u0027You have no right to make such a proposition,\u0027 I said firmly.\\n\\n \u0027I shall have!\u0027 Alisa shook her head and took a deep breath. \u0027Zabulon!\u0027\\n\\n I waited, clutching the little combat disc in my hand.\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon, I summon you!\u0027 Her voice had become a high-pitched screech. I noticed the human shadows around us begin moving a little faster: a vague, inexplicable feeling of alarm was making the people lengthen their strides.\\n\\n Would her summons reach the Dark Ones\u0027 chief again?\\n\\n Like that time at the Maharajah restaurant, when Zabulon had almost killed me with Shahab\u0027s Lash?\\n\\n But he hadn\u0027t killed me. He\u0027d missed.\\n\\n Even though the whole operation had been planned by Gesar, and Zabulon really seemed to believe that I was guilty of killing Dark Ones.\\n\\n Did that mean he\u0027d already had other plans for me?\\n\\n Or had Gesar intervened, secretly and unobtrusively, diverted the streaks of lightning away from me?\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know. As always, I didn\u0027t have enough information. I could have come up with thirty-three different explanations, each contradicting the others.\\n\\n I was almost hoping Zabulon wouldn\u0027t respond. Then I\u0027d be able to pull Alisa out of the Twilight, call in the boss or one of the operatives, hand the fool over to them and receive a bonus at the end of the month. But what did I care about bonuses right now?\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon!\u0027 There was genuine supplication in her voice. \u0027Zabulon!\u0027\\n\\n She was crying now, without even realising it. The mascara had run under her eyes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-66.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
