{"id":101355,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"The investigator left me in peace and went to talk to the dead man\u0027s wife. Boris Ignatievich immediately made straight for our table. Nobody paid any attention to him, he was clearly protected by some mild distraction spell. \u0027Now you\u0027ve done it,\u0027 he said simply. \u0027Us?\u0027 I asked, just to get things clear. \u0027Yes. Both of you. But especially you, Anton.\u0027 \u0027I followed all the instructions I was given,\u0027 I whispered, feeling furious. \u0027And I never laid a finger on that magician.\u0027 The boss sighed. \u0027I don\u0027t doubt that. But, knowing the situation, how could you, a member of the Night Watch staff, be so stupid as to go off after a Dark One on your own?\u0027 \u0027Who could have foreseen this?\u0027 I asked indignantly. \u0027Tell me who!\u0027 \u0027You could. After the unprecedented measures we\u0027ve taken to disguise your identity. What were your instructions? Never be left alone for a moment! Eat and sleep with Svetlana! Take your showers together! Go to the lavatory together! Every single moment you had to be . . .\u0027 The boss stopped and sighed. \u0027Boris Ignatievich,\u0027 Svetlana spoke up. \u0027None of that matters any more. Let\u0027s try to think what we can do now.\u0027 The boss looked at her in surprise and nodded. \u0027You\u0027re right. Let\u0027s try to think. Starting from the fact that the situation is catastrophic now. Before, any suspicion of Anton was purely circumstantial, but now he\u0027s been caught red-handed. Don\u0027t shake your head like that! You were seen standing over a body that had just been killed. The body of a Dark Magician, killed in the same way as all the previous victims. The Day Watch will appeal to the tribunal for your memory to be read.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s very dangerous, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 asked Svetlana. \u0027But at least it will prove Anton isn\u0027t guilty.\u0027 \u0027Yes, it will, Svetlana. And in the process the Dark Ones will acquire all the information Anton has had access to. Do you realise just how much the Watch\u0027s senior programmer knows? Some things he may not even be aware of, he just glanced at the data, processed it and forgot it. But the Dark Ones have their own specialists, and when Anton comes out of that courtroom – assuming he survives having his mind turned inside out – the Day Watch will know about all our operations. Can\u0027t you see what will happen? Our teaching methods, the way we look for new Others, the way we analyse combat operations, our networks of human informers, our casualty lists, our employees\u0027 personal files, our financial plans . . .\u0027 They were talking about me, while I just sat there as if I had nothing to do with what was going on. It wasn\u0027t just cynical frankness, it was simpler than that: the boss was consulting with Svetlana, a novice magician, and not with me, a potential magician of the third grade. If I compared the situation with a game of chess, it was insultingly simple. I was a rook, an ordinary officer of the Watch, and Svetlana was a pawn – but a pawn about to become a queen. And for the boss all the bad things that could happen to me meant nothing compared with the chance to give Svetlana a little practical lesson. \u0027Boris Ignatievich, you know I won\u0027t allow them to read my memory,\u0027 I said. \u0027Then you\u0027ll be found guilty.\u0027 \u0027I know. I swear I had nothing to do with the death of these Dark Ones. But I don\u0027t have any proof.\u0027 \u0027Boris Ignatievich, what if we suggest they only check Anton\u0027s memory for today?\u0027 Svetlana exclaimed joyfully. \u0027That would solve everything, they\u0027d be convinced—\u0027 \u0027The memory can\u0027t be sliced up like that, Sveta. It spills out all in one piece. Starting from the first moment of life. With the taste of the amniotic fluid in the womb, with the smell of mother\u0027s milk.\u0027 The boss was speaking very emphatically now. \u0027That\u0027s the problem. Even if Anton didn\u0027t know any secrets. Imagine what it\u0027s like to remember absolutely everything and go through it all again. Swaying in that dark, viscous liquid, the walls closing in on you, the glimmer of light ahead, the pain, the choking sensation, the struggle to survive your own birth. And so on, moment by moment – you\u0027ve heard it said that when you\u0027re dying your whole life flashes in front of your eyes? That\u0027s exactly what happens when they turn out your memory. And at the same time, somewhere deep inside, you still remember that all this has already happened. Can you understand that? It\u0027s hard to hold on to your sanity.\u0027 \u0027You say that,\u0027 Svetlana said uncertainly, \u0027as if-—\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve been through it. But not in an interrogation. More than a century ago. The Watch was still studying the effects of exposing and reading the memory, and a volunteer was required. Afterwards it took them about a year to restore me to normal.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 Svetlana asked curiously. \u0027With new impressions. Experiences I hadn\u0027t had before. Foreign countries, unfamiliar food, surprise meetings, unfamiliar problems. And even so . . .\u0027 The boss smiled wryly. \u0027I still sometimes catch myself thinking: What is all this – reality or just memories? Am I living it or lying on a crystal slab in the Day Watch office while they unwind my memory like a ball of string?\u0027 He stopped. There were people sitting at the tables around us, waiters bustling to and fro. The crime scene team had taken away the body of the Dark Magician and a man, evidently a relative, had come for the widow and the children. Nobody else seemed to be affected by what had happened. Quite the opposite, in fact. There were more customers, with bigger appetites and a greater zest for life. And nobody there was taking any notice of us: the boss\u0027s casual spell made them all look away. What if all of this had already happened? What if I, Anton Gorodetsky, systems administrator at the Nix trading company, and also a Night Watch magician, was lying on a crystal slab covered with ancient runes? And my memory was being unwound, examined, dissected by someone – it didn\u0027t matter who, Dark Magicians or a joint tribunal of both sides? No! That couldn\u0027t be right. I didn\u0027t have that feeling the boss had been talking about. I had no sense of déjà vu. I\u0027d never been in a woman\u0027s body before, and I\u0027d never found any bodies in restaurant lavatories. \u0027I\u0027ve laid out the problem,\u0027 said the boss, drawing a long, slim cigarillo out of his pocket. \u0027Is the situation clear? What are we going to do?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m prepared to do my duty,\u0027 I said. \u0027Don\u0027t be in such a rush, Anton. Drop the bravado.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not bravado. It\u0027s not just that I\u0027m prepared to protect the secrets of the Watch. I simply wouldn\u0027t survive that kind of interrogation. Better to die.\u0027 \u0027But we don\u0027t die the same way people do.\u0027 \u0027Sure, it\u0027s tougher for us. But I\u0027m ready for that.\u0027 The boss sighed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, ladies. Anton, let\u0027s forget the consequences for a moment and try thinking about what led up to this incident. Sometimes it\u0027s helpful to look back.\u0027 \u0027Okay,\u0027 I said, not feeling particularly hopeful. \u0027The Maverick has been poaching in the city for several years. The latest information from the analytical section indicates that these strange killings began three and a half years ago. Some of the victims are known Dark Ones. Some are probably potentials. None of the victims was higher than grade four. None of them worked for the Day Watch. It\u0027s ironic that almost all of them were moderate Dark Ones, if you can put it like that. They killed and they influenced people, but far less than they could have done.\u0027 \u0027They were set up, weren\u0027t they?\u0027 said Svetlana. \u0027They must have been. The Day Watch didn\u0027t touch this psychopath, it even laid on victims for him from the Dark Side – those it could easily spare. But what for? That\u0027s the important question: what for?\u0027 \u0027So they could accuse us of incompetence,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027The end doesn\u0027t justify the means.\u0027 \u0027In order to set up one of us.\u0027 \u0027Anton, the only member of the Night Watch who doesn\u0027t have alibis for the times of the killings is you. Why would the Day Watch go hunting for you?\u0027 I shrugged. \u0027Zabulon\u0027s revenge?\u0027 said the boss, shaking his head. \u0027No. You only clashed with him recently, yet this was carefully planned three and a half years ago. We\u0027re still left with the question why?\u0027 \u0027Maybe Anton is potentially a very powerful magician,\u0027 Svetlana suggested, speaking softly. \u0027And the Dark Ones have realised that. It\u0027s too late to bring him over to their side, so they decided to eliminate him.\u0027 \u0027Anton is more powerful than he realises,\u0027 the boss replied sharply, \u0027but he\u0027ll never get higher than grade two.\u0027 \u0027What if our enemies can see further along the possible realities than we can?\u0027 I asked, looking the boss in the eye. \u0027And?\u0027 \u0027Maybe I\u0027m a weak magician, I may be average or powerful, but what if it\u0027s enough just for me to do something in order to change the balance of power? Do something simple that has nothing to do with magic? Boris Ignatievich, the Dark Ones tried to get me away from Svetlana – that means they could see the branch of reality in which I could help her. What if they can see something else? Something in the future? What if they\u0027ve been able to see it for a long time, and they\u0027ve been getting ready to take me out of the game? What if the fight over Sveta is small change by comparison?\u0027 At first the boss listened carefully. Then he frowned and shook his head. \u0027Anton, you\u0027re suffering from megalomania. I\u0027m sorry, but I check the lines of everybody working in the Watch, from key staff to our plumber, Uncle Shura. And there simply aren\u0027t any great achievements in your future. Not on any of the reality lines.\u0027 \u0027Boris Ignatievich, are you absolutely sure you haven\u0027t missed something?\u0027 He\u0027d really made me angry now. \u0027Of course not. I\u0027m not absolutely sure of anything. Not even of myself. But the chances of you being right are very, very slim. Believe me.\u0027 I believed him. Compared with the boss, my powers approximate to zero. \u0027So we still don\u0027t know the most important thing – the reason?\u0027 \u0027Right. The hit is aimed at you, there\u0027s no doubt about that now. The Maverick is being controlled, very subtly and precisely. He believes he\u0027s waging war on Evil, but he\u0027s always been a puppet, with someone else pulling the strings. Today they brought him to the same restaurant you came to. They handed him a victim. And you went right along.\u0027 \u0027Then what are we going to do?\u0027 \u0027Try to find the Maverick. It\u0027s our only chance, Anton.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re actually going to kill him, though?\u0027 \u0027No, we\u0027re not. All we\u0027re going to do is find him.\u0027 \u0027All the same. No matter how bad he might be, no matter how wrong he\u0027s got everything, he\u0027s still one of us. He\u0027s fighting against Evil the best way he knows how. We just have to explain everything to him.\u0027 \u0027Too late, Anton. Too late. We missed him when he appeared. Now, after all he\u0027s done . . . Remember how that girl vampire died?\u0027 I nodded: \u0027Laid to eternal rest.\u0027 \u0027And her crimes were far less serious – from the Dark Ones\u0027 point of view. She didn\u0027t understand what was going on either. But the Day Watch accepted that she was guilty.\u0027 \u0027Was that pure coincidence?\u0027 asked Svetlana. \u0027Or were they creating a precedent?\u0027 \u0027Who knows? Anton, you have to find the Maverick.\u0027 I looked up, amazed. \u0027Find him and hand him over to the Dark Ones,\u0027 the boss said sternly. \u0027Why me?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-38.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
