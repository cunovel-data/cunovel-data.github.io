{"id":101339,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\u0027Thanks, Svetlana. I\u0027d love some.\u0027\n She got up and went into the kitchen. I followed her. What was going on here?\n \u0027Anton, we have a provisional analysis . . .\u0027\n I thought I glimpsed the white silhouette of a bird through the curtained window – it flitted along the wall, following Svetlana.\n \u0027Ignat followed the usual plan. Compliments, interest, infatuation, love. She liked it, but it made the vortex grow. You\u0027re using a different approach – sympathy. Passive sympathy.\u0027\n No recommendations followed, which meant the analysts hadn\u0027t reached any conclusions yet. But at least now I knew what I had to do next. Look at her sadly, smile sympathetically, drink tea and say: \u0027Your eyes look tired, Sveta . . .\u0027\n We\u0027d be talking to each other like friends, right? Of course we would. I was sure of that.\n \u0027Anton?\u0027\n I\u0027d been staring at her too long. Svetlana was standing by the cooker, not moving, holding a kettle with its shiny surface dulled by condensation. She wasn\u0027t exactly frightened, that feeling was already beyond her, completely drained out of her by the black vortex. It was more like she was embarrassed.\n \u0027Is something wrong?\u0027 she asked.\n \u0027Yes. It feels awkward, Svetlana. I just turned up in the middle of the night, dumped my problems on you and now I\u0027m hanging around, waiting for tea . . .\u0027\n \u0027Anton, please stay. You know, I\u0027ve had such a strange day, and being here alone . . . Let\u0027s call it my fee for the consultation, shall we? That is, you staying for a while and talking to me,\u0027 she explained hastily.\n I nodded. Any word might be a mistake.\n \u0027The vortex has shrunk another fifteen centimetres. You\u0027ve chosen the right tactic, Anton.\u0027\n But I hadn\u0027t chosen anything, why couldn\u0027t those lousy analysts understand that? I\u0027d used the powers of an Other to enter someone else\u0027s home, I\u0027d interfered with someone else\u0027s memory so I could stay there longer . . . and now I was just going with the flow.\n And hoping the current would bring me out where I needed to be.\n \u0027Would you like some jam, Anton?\u0027\n \u0027Yes . . .\u0027\n A mad tea party! Move over, Lewis Carroll. The maddest tea parties aren\u0027t the ones in the rabbit\u0027s burrow, with the Mad Hatter, the Dormouse and the March Hare round the table. A small kitchen in a small apartment, tea left over from the morning, topped up with boiling water, raspberry jam from a three-litre jar – this is the stage on which unknown actors play out genuinely mad tea parties. This is the place, the only place where they say the words that they would never say otherwise. This is where they pull nasty little secrets out of the darkness with a conjuror\u0027s flourish, where they take the family skeletons out of the closet, where they discover the cyanide sprinkled in the sugar bowl. And you can never find a reason to get up and leave, because every time they pour you more tea, offer you jam and move the sugar bowl a bit closer . . .\n \u0027Anton, I\u0027ve known you for a year already . . .\u0027\n A shadow, a brief, perplexed shadow in Svetlana\u0027s eyes. Her memory obligingly fills in the blanks, her memory hands her explanations for why a man as likeable and good as me is still no more than her patient.\n \u0027Only from my work, of course, but now ... I feel I\u0027d like to talk to you somehow ... as a neighbour. As a friend. Is that okay?\u0027\n \u0027Of course, Sveta.\u0027\n A grateful smile. It\u0027s not so easy to use the familiar form of my name. From Anton to Antosha is too big a step.\n \u0027Thank you, Anton. You know ... I just don\u0027t know where I am. For the last three days now.\u0027\n Of course, it\u0027s not so easy to know where you are when you have the sword of Nemesis hanging over you. Blind, furious Nemesis, escaped from the power of the dead gods . . .\n \u0027Today . . . never mind . . .\u0027\n She wanted to tell me about Ignat. She didn\u0027t understand what was happening to her, why a chance encounter had almost got all the way to the bed. She felt like she was going insane. Everybody who comes within the Others\u0027 sphere of activity has thoughts like that.\n \u0027Svetlana, perhaps. . . perhaps you\u0027ve fallen out with someone?\u0027\n That was a crude move. But I was in a hurry. I didn\u0027t even know why myself, as so far the vortex was stable, it was even shrinking. But I was in a hurry.\n \u0027Why do you think that?\u0027\n Svetlana wasn\u0027t surprised and she didn\u0027t think the question was too personal. I shrugged and tried to explain:\n \u0027It often happens to me.\u0027\n \u0027No, Anton. I haven\u0027t fallen out with anyone. I\u0027ve no one to fall out with, and no reason. It\u0027s something inside me . . .\u0027\n That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong, I thought. You\u0027ve no idea how wrong you are. Black vortices the size of the one hanging over you only appear once in every hundred years. And that means someone hates you with the kind of power rarely granted to anyone, even to an Other.\n \u0027You probably need a holiday,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027To get away somewhere, far away to the back of beyond.\u0027\n As I said that I realised there was a solution to the problem after all. Maybe not a complete solution, it would still be fatal for Svetlana. She could go away. Out into the taiga or the tundra, to the North Pole. And then it would happen there – the volcano would erupt, the asteroid would hit, or the cruise missile with the nuclear warheads would strike. The Inferno would erupt, but Svetlana would be the only one to suffer.\n It\u0027s a good thing that solutions like that are as impossible for us as the murder suggested by the Dark Magician.\n \u0027What are you thinking, Anton?\u0027\n \u0027Sveta, what\u0027s happened to you?\u0027\n \u0027Too abrupt, Anton! Steer the conversation away from that.\u0027\n \u0027Is it really that obvious?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Svetlana lowered her eyes. Any moment I was expecting Olga to shout that the black vortex had begun its final, catastrophic spurt of growth, that I\u0027d ruined everything and now I\u0027d have thousands of human lives on my conscience for ever . . . but Olga didn\u0027t say a word.\n \u0027I betrayed . . .\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I betrayed my mother.\u0027\n She looked at me seriously, not a trace of the posturing of someone who\u0027s pulled some really low-down trick and is boasting about it.\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand. Sveta . . .\u0027\n \u0027My mother\u0027s ill, Anton. Her kidneys. She needs regular dialysis, but that\u0027s only a half-measure. Well, anyway, they suggested a transplant to me.\u0027\n \u0027Why suggest that to you?\u0027 I still didn\u0027t understand.\n \u0027They suggested I should give my mother one kidney. It would almost certainly be accepted, I even had all the tests done . . . and then I refused. I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t say anything. Everything was clear now. Something about me must have clicked, something about me had made Svetlana feel she could be totally open with me. So it was her mother.\n Her mother!\n \u0027Well done, Anton. The guys are already on their way.\u0027 Olga\u0027s voice sounded triumphant. And so it should – we\u0027d found the Black Magician! \u0027Would you believe it, at first contact nobody felt a thing, they thought there was nothing to her . . . Well done. Calm her down, Anton, talk to her, comfort her.\u0027\n You can\u0027t stop your ears in the Twilight. You have to listen when you\u0027re spoken to.\n \u0027Svetlana, you know no one has the right to demand—\u0027\n \u0027Yes, of course. I told my mother, and she told me to forget about it. She said she\u0027d kill herself if I decided to go ahead with it. She said, what difference did it make to her, when she was going to die anyway? And it wasn\u0027t worth crippling myself for her. I shouldn\u0027t have told her anything. I should have just donated the kidney. She could have found out later, after the operation. You can even give birth with one kidney . . . there have been cases.\u0027\n Kidneys. What nonsense! What a petty problem! One hour\u0027s work for a genuine Light Magician. But we weren\u0027t allowed to heal people, every genuine cure gave a Dark Magician a permit to cast a curse or put the evil eye on someone. And it was her mother, her own mother, who had cursed her, in a split-second emotional outburst, without realising what she was doing, while she was telling her daughter not even to think about having the operation.\n And that had set the monstrous black vortex growing.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what I ought to do now, Anton. I keep doing stupid things . . . Today I almost jumped into bed with a stranger.\u0027 For Svetlana to tell me that must have been almost as difficult as telling me about her mother.\n \u0027Sveta, we can think of something,\u0027 I began. \u0027The important thing is not just to give up, not punish yourself unnecessarily.\u0027\n \u0027I told her on purpose, Anton! I knew what she\u0027d say! I wanted to be told not to do it! She ought to have cursed me, the damned old fool!\u0027\n Svetlana had no idea how right she was. . . No one knows what mechanisms are involved here, what goes on in the Twilight, and how being cursed by a stranger is different from being cursed by someone you love ... by your child or by your mother. Except that a mother\u0027s curse is the most terrible of all.\n \u0027Anton, take it easy.\u0027\n The sound of Olga\u0027s voice sobered me up instantly.\n \u0027That\u0027s too simple, Anton. Have you ever dealt with a mother\u0027s curse?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said. I said it out loud, answering Svetlana and Olga at the same time.\n \u0027I\u0027m to blame,\u0027 said Svetlana, with a shake of her head. \u0027Thanks, Anton, but I\u0027m to blame and no one else.\u0027\n \u0027I have,\u0027 the voice said through the Twilight. Anton, my friend, this looks all wrong! A mother\u0027s curse is a blinding black explosion and a large vortex. But it always dissipates in an instant. Almost always.\u0027\n Maybe so. I didn\u0027t argue with her. Olga was a specialist in curses and she\u0027d seen all sorts of things. Of course, nobody would wish their own child ill ... at least, not for long. But there were exceptions.\n \u0027Exceptions are possible,\u0027 Olga agreed. \u0027\u0027They\u0027ll check her mother out thoroughly now. But. . . I wouldn\u0027t count on this being over soon.\u0027\n \u0027Svetlana,\u0027 I asked. \u0027Isn\u0027t there any other solution? Some other way to help your mother? Apart from a transplant?\u0027\n \u0027No. I\u0027m a doctor, I know. Medicine\u0027s not all-powerful.\u0027\n \u0027What if it wasn\u0027t medicine?\u0027\n She was puzzled.\n \u0027What do you mean, Anton?\u0027\n \u0027Alternative medicine,\u0027 I said. \u0027Folk medicine.\u0027\n \u0027Anton . . .\u0027\n \u0027I understand, Svetlana, it\u0027s hard to believe,\u0027 I added hastily. \u0027There are so many charlatans, conmen and psychos out there. But is all of it really lies?\u0027\n \u0027Anton, can you show me one person who has cured a really serious illness?\u0027 said Svetlana, looking at me ironically. \u0027Not just tell me about him, but show him to me. And his patients too, preferably before and after treatment. Then I\u0027ll believe, I\u0027ll believe in anything. In psychics, and healers, in white magicians and black magicians . . .\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-21.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
