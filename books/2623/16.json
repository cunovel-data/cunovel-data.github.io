They\u0027re people who have been totally transformed by the Twilight world. They acquire immense powers, but they lose the gift of life itself. And they can only carry on existing by using the energy of other beings. Blood\u0027s the most convenient form for transferring it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they kill people!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They can exist on donor\u0027s blood. It\u0027s like processed foods, it doesn\u0027t taste so good, but it\u0027s still nutritious. If the vampires just went out hunting—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But they attacked me!\u0027\\n\\n He was only thinking about himself right now. That wasn\u0027t good.\\n\\n \u0027Some vampires break the law. That\u0027s why we need the Night Watch, to police the observance of the Treaty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then . . . vampires don\u0027t just go around hunting people, right?\u0027\\n\\n I felt a breath of wind against my cheek from invisible wings. The claws dug into my shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Now what are you going to tell him, Night Watch agent?\u0027 Olga whispered from out of the depths of the Twilight. \u0027Will you risk telling him the truth?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, they go hunting,\u0027 I said. Then I added the thing that had struck me as most terrible of all five years earlier. \u0027If they have a licence. Sometimes . . . sometimes they need living blood.\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t ask straight off. I could read everything the boy was thinking in his eyes, everything he wanted to ask. And I knew I\u0027d have to answer all the questions.\\n\\n \u0027Then what do you do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We make sure there\u0027s no poaching.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then they could have attacked me . . . under that Treaty of yours? With a licence?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027They could have drunk my blood? And you would have just walked by and looked the other way?\u0027\\n\\n Light and Dark . . .\\n\\n I closed my eyes. The Treaty blazed brightly in the grey mist. Stark words, the product of thousands of years of war, costing millions of lives.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go away!\u0027\\n\\n The boy was as tense as a coiled spring. On the brink of hysteria, on the brink of insanity.\\n\\n \u0027I came to protect you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t bother!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The girl vampire\u0027s on the loose. She tried to attack—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go away!\u0027\\n\\n Olga sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Now you\u0027ve done it!\u0027\\n\\n I stood up. Egor shuddered and moved his stool further away from me.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll understand some day,\u0027 I said. \u0027We have no other option. . .\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t believe the words I was saying. And it was pointless to argue now. It was getting dark outside, pretty soon it would be hunting time . . .\\n\\n The boy followed me, as if he wanted to make sure I left the apartment and didn\u0027t hide in the cupboard. I didn\u0027t say another word, just opened the door and went out into the stairwell. The door slammed shut behind me.\\n\\n I walked up one flight of stairs and squatted down by the window on the landing. Olga didn\u0027t say anything and neither did I.\\n\\n You can\u0027t just go revealing the truth like that out of the blue. It\u0027s not easy for a normal person even to admit that we exist. But to come to terms with the Treaty . . .\\n\\n \u0027There was nothing we could have done,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027We underestimated the boy, both his powers and his fear. We were discovered. We were obliged to answer his questions and to tell the truth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are we drawing up a report?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027If you only knew how many reports like that I\u0027ve drawn up . . .\u0027\\n\\n There was a smell of decay from the garbage chute. Outside, the noisy avenue was slowly descending into the evening dusk. The streetlamps were already beginning to flicker. I sat there, toying with my mobile phone and wondering if I ought to call the boss now or wait for him to call. Boris Ignatievich was probably observing me.\\n\\n He was bound to be.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t expect the boss to be able to give you too much help,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027He\u0027s up to his ears already with that black vortex.\u0027\\n\\n The phone in my hand started ringing, and I answered it.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are you, Anton?\u0027\\n\\n The boss sounded tired, worn out. I\u0027d never heard him sound like that before.\\n\\n \u0027On a landing in a big, ugly apartment block. Beside the garbage chute. It\u0027s quite warm here, pretty comfortable really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you find the boy?\u0027 the boss asked, sounding entirely uninterested.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. I\u0027ll send you Tiger Cub and Bear. There\u0027s nothing for them to do here anyway. And you come to Perovo. Now.\u0027\\n\\n I was just reaching for my pocket when the boss added:\\n\\n \u0027If you haven\u0027t got any money ... even if you have, stop a militia car and get them to bring you here as fast as they can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you really mean that?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely. You can leave straight away.\u0027\\n\\n I looked out of the window into the darkness.\\n\\n \u0027Boris Ignatievich, it\u0027s not a good idea to leave the kid alone. He really is potentially very powerful . . . \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know that . . . Okay. The guys are on their way. There\u0027s no danger to the boy once they\u0027re there. Wait for them to arrive, then come straight here.\u0027\\n\\n He hung up. I put away my phone and looked sideways at my shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027What do you make of that, Olga?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Odd.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why? You said yourself they wouldn\u0027t be able to handle it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s odd that he wanted you to go, not me . . .\u0027 Olga said thoughtfully. \u0027Maybe . . . no, it can\u0027t be that. I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n I took a look through the Twilight and spotted two little specks right on the horizon. The field operatives were coming so fast they would reach me in about fifteen minutes.\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t even ask the address,\u0027 I commented glumly.\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t want to waste any time. Didn\u0027t you feel him take the co-ordinates?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You need more training, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t work in the field.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do now. Let\u0027s go downstairs. We\u0027ll hear the Call.\u0027\\n\\n I got up – that spot on the staircase had begun to feel really comfortable, just like home – and set off down the stairs. I was miserable, I had a really bad feeling about this. A door slammed behind my back. I turned round.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 Egor said, coming straight to the point.\\n\\n \u0027Everything\u0027s fine.\u0027 I started walking back up. \u0027We\u0027re guarding you.\u0027\\n\\n He chewed on his lips, shifting his gaze from me to the gloom of the staircase and back again. He didn\u0027t want to let me back into the flat, but he couldn\u0027t bear to be alone any longer.\\n\\n \u0027I think someone\u0027s watching me,\u0027 he said eventually. \u0027Are you doing that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Most likely it\u0027s the vampire.\u0027\\n\\n The boy didn\u0027t even shiver. I hadn\u0027t told him anything new.\\n\\n \u0027How does she attack?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She can\u0027t come in through the door unless she\u0027s invited. That\u0027s one thing about vampires that the fairy tales have right. You\u0027ll feel like you want to go out yourself. In fact, you already want to go out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I won\u0027t go out!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When she uses the Call, you\u0027ll go. You\u0027ll understand what\u0027s happening, but you\u0027ll still go anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you . . . can you tell me what to do? Anything?\u0027\\n\\n Egor had given in. He wanted help, any help he could get.\\n\\n \u0027I can. Trust us.\u0027\\n\\n He only hesitated for a second.\\n\\n \u0027Come in.\u0027 Egor stepped back from the door. \u0027Only . . . Mum will be back from work any moment.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to hide? What should I tell her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s no problem,\u0027 I said dismissively. \u0027But I—\u0027\\n\\n The door of the next-door apartment opened cautiously, just a crack, on the chain. A wrinkled, old woman\u0027s face peeped out.\\n\\n I touched her mind, lightly, just for an instant, as carefully as possible so as not to do any more damage to a reason that was already shaky.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, it\u0027s you . . .\u0027 the old woman said with a beaming smile. \u0027You, you . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton,\u0027 I prompted her politely.\\n\\n \u0027And there was I wondering who the stranger was, wandering up and down,\u0027 said the old granny, taking off the chain and coming out on to the landing. \u0027The times we live in, the outrageous things people get up to, they just do whatever they like . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right. Everything\u0027s going to be all right. Why don\u0027t you turn on the TV, there\u0027s a new series just starting.\u0027\\n\\n The old woman nodded, shot me a friendly glance and disappeared into her apartment.\\n\\n \u0027What series?\u0027 asked Egor.\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. There must be something. Isn\u0027t there always some soap opera or other?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how do you know our neighbour?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n The boy said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Just one of those little things,\u0027 I explained. \u0027And I won\u0027t come in, thanks, I have to go now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027ll be different guards here to look after you, Egor. And don\u0027t worry – they\u0027re far more professional than I am.\u0027\\n\\n I took a glance through the Twilight; two bright orange lights were just approaching the entrance of the building.\\n\\n \u0027I ... I don\u0027t want them,\u0027 said the boy, panicking immediately. \u0027I want you to stay!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t. I have another assignment.\u0027\\n\\n Down below, the entrance door slammed and there was a clatter of footsteps on the stairs. The action heroes disdained to use the lift.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want them!\u0027 Egor grabbed hold of the door as if he\u0027d decided to shut himself in. \u0027I don\u0027t trust them!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-16.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
