{"id":101379,"no":62,"title":"Page 62","content":"\u0027Because, my dear boy, in this arena it\u0027s still possible to achieve something. The potential of Europe and North America has already been exhausted. Everything that was possible has already been tried there. There are a few things being developed right now. But all those countries are already half asleep. A healthy pensioner in shorts with a video camera – that\u0027s the prosperity of the West. We need to experiment with the young ones. Russia, Asia, the Arab world – these are where present-day battles are fought. And don\u0027t look so offended, I love my country as much as you do! I\u0027ve spilled more blood for it than you have flowing in your veins. What you\u0027ve got to understand, Antosha, is that the battlefield is the entire world. You know that as well as I do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our war\u0027s with the Dark, not with humans!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, with the Dark. But we can only win by creating an ideal society. A world that will be ruled by goodness, love and justice. The Watches don\u0027t exist to capture psychopathic magicians on the streets and issue licences to vampires! All those little things take up time and energy, but they\u0027re by-products, like the heat from a light bulb. Light bulbs are meant to produce light, not heat. We have to change the human world, not just neutralise the Dark\u0027s minor outbursts. That\u0027s the goal. That\u0027s the path to victory!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Olga, I understand that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wonderful. Then you have to understand something that\u0027s never said in so many words. We\u0027ve been fighting for thousands of years. And all that time we\u0027ve been trying to change the course of history. To create a new world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A brave new world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be so ironic. We have achieved something, after all. Through all the blood and suffering the world is becoming a more humane place. But we need a real, genuine revolution.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Communism was our idea, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not ours, but we supported it. It seemed quite attractive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So now what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll see.\u0027 Olga smiled. A friendly, sincere smile. \u0027Anton, everything will be fine. Trust me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need to know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. That\u0027s exactly what you don\u0027t need. And you don\u0027t need to worry, we\u0027re not planning any revolutions. No prison camps, execution squads or military tribunals. We\u0027re not going to repeat our old mistakes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to make new ones instead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton!\u0027 she said, raising her voice. \u0027Think about it, will you, what are you doing? We have a really good chance of winning. Our country has a chance to live in peace, to flourish. It could become the vanguard of humanity. Defeat the Dark. It\u0027s been twelve years in the making, Anton. And it\u0027s not just Gesar\u0027s project, the whole senior level\u0027s been working on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Did you think it was all being done on the spur of the moment?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were keeping tabs on Svetlana for twelve years?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course not! A new social model has been developed. Various elements of the plan have already been put into action. Not even I know all the details. Since then Gesar\u0027s been waiting for the key players in the plan to come together, in space and time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who exactly? Svetlana and the Inquisitor?\u0027\\n\\n The pupils of her eyes contracted, and I knew I\u0027d guessed it. Or part of it.\\n\\n \u0027And what else? What part am I supposed to play in all this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll find out when the time comes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Olga, so far magical intervention in human life has never led to anything good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t come up with those old schoolroom axioms,\u0027 she said, getting really worked up now. \u0027Don\u0027t think you\u0027re any wiser than anyone else. We\u0027ve no intention of using magic. Calm down, relax.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Okay. You\u0027ve explained your position. I don\u0027t agree with it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Officially?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. In a private capacity. And as a private individual I believe I have the right of opposition.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Opposition? To Gesar?\u0027 Olga\u0027s eyes opened wide and the corners of her lips curved up in a smile. \u0027Anton!\u0027\\n\\n I turned on my heel and went out.\\n\\n Yes, it was laughable.\\n\\n Yes, it was absurd.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t just a crazy project dreamed up by Gesar and Olga. It wasn\u0027t just an attempt to repeat a failed experiment. It was a meticulously prepared operation, planned over a long period, and it had been my bad luck to get caught up in it.\\n\\n An operation approved at the highest level.\\n\\n Approved by the Light.\\n\\n Why was I getting so involved? I had no right to be. None at all. And I had absolutely no chance either. I could console myself with the wise parable about the grain of sand that stopped the clock, but right now I was a grain of sand caught between mill wheels.\\n\\n And the saddest thing of all was that these were the mill wheels of my own side. Nobody would persecute me. Nobody would fight me. They\u0027d simply stop me doing all those stupid things that wouldn\u0027t do any good in any case.\\n\\n Then why did I feel this pain, this unendurable pain in my chest?\\n\\n I was standing on the terrace, clenching my fists in impotent fury, when I felt a hand on my shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Looks like you\u0027ve managed to figure something out, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n I glanced at Semyon and nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Hard to take?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I admitted.\\n\\n \u0027Then just remember one thing. You\u0027re not just a grain of sand. Nobody\u0027s just a grain of sand. Especially if he\u0027s an Other.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How long do you have to live to be able to guess what someone else is thinking like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A hundred years, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then Gesar can read any of us like an open book?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then I\u0027ll have to learn how not to think,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027For that you have to learn how to think first. Did you know there\u0027s been a skirmish in town?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A quarter of an hour ago. It\u0027s all over already.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A courier arrived to see the boss, from somewhere out east. The Dark Ones followed him and tried to eliminate him. Right there in front of the boss.\u0027 Semyon laughed.\\n\\n \u0027That means war!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, they were within their rights. The courier entered the city illegally.\u0027\\n\\n I looked around. Nobody was in any hurry to go anywhere. They weren\u0027t starting up their cars or packing their things. Ignat and Ilya were lighting up the barbecue again.\\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t we be getting back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. The boss handled things his own way. There was a small fight, without any casualties. The courier\u0027s been made a member of our Watch, and the Dark Ones had to leave empty-handed. The restaurant suffered a bit, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What restaurant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The restaurant where the boss met the courier,\u0027 Semyon explained patiently. \u0027We\u0027ve been told we can carry on with our holiday.\u0027\\n\\n I looked up at the blindingly blue sky, swelling with the heat.\\n\\n \u0027You know, somehow I\u0027m not in the mood for a holiday. I think I\u0027ll go back to Moscow. I don\u0027t suppose anyone will mind too much.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course not.\u0027\\n\\n Semyon took out his cigarettes and lit up. Then he said casually:\\n\\n \u0027In your place, I\u0027d find out exactly what the courier brought with him from the east. Maybe that\u0027s your chance.\u0027\\n\\n I laughed bitterly.\\n\\n \u0027The Dark Ones couldn\u0027t find out. Are you suggesting I should start rummaging in the boss\u0027s safe?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Dark Ones couldn\u0027t take it. Whatever it was. You have no right to take what the courier brought or even touch it, of course. But just finding out. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks. I really mean that.\u0027\\n\\n Semyon nodded, accepting my gratitude graciously.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll settle up in the Twilight. You know, I\u0027ve had enough holiday too. After lunch I\u0027m going to borrow Tiger Cub\u0027s motorbike and go back to town. Want a lift?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Uhuh.\u0027\\n\\n I felt ashamed. It was the kind of shame that probably only Others can feel. We can always tell when someone\u0027s helping us out, when they\u0027re giving us something we don\u0027t deserve but can\u0027t possibly refuse.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t stay there any longer. Stay there and see Svetlana, Olga and Ignat. Listen to their truth.\\n\\n I would always have my own truth.\\n\\n \u0027Can you handle a motorbike?\u0027 I asked, clumsily trying to change the subject.\\n\\n \u0027I rode one in the first Paris – Dakar rally. Let\u0027s go give the others a hand.\u0027\\n\\n I glanced sullenly at Ignat. He was chopping wood, handling the axe like a real virtuoso. After every blow he froze for a moment and looked round quickly at everyone, flexing his biceps.\\n\\n He really loved himself. Sure, he loved the rest of the world too. But he came first.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s do that,\u0027 I agreed. I swung back my arm and threw the sign of the triple blade through the Twilight. Several blocks of wood flew apart into neat sticks of firewood just as Ignat raised his axe for the next blow. He lost his balance and almost fell. Then he started to look around.\\n\\n Naturally my blow had left a spatial trace. The Twilight was vibrating, greedily drawing in energy.\\n\\n \u0027Antosha, what did you do that for?\u0027 Ignat asked crossly. \u0027That\u0027s not the sporting way!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it is efficient,\u0027 I said, walking down from the terrace. \u0027Shall I chop some more?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t bother,\u0027 said Ignat, bending down to collect up the firewood. \u0027Carry on like that and we\u0027ll end up grilling the kebabs with fireballs.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t feel at all guilty, but I started helping anyway. The firewood had been chopped cleanly and the cuts glittered a rich amber yellow. It seemed a shame to put something so beautiful on the fire.\\n\\n Then I looked at the house and saw Olga standing at the ground-floor window.\\n\\n She\u0027d been following my little escapade very closely. Far too closely.\\n\\n I waved to her.\\n\\n CHAPTER 5\\n\\n TIGER CUB\u0027S motorbike was really great, if such a vague word can ever be applied to a Harley, even the most basic model. After all, there are motorbikes, and then there are Harley-Davidsons.\\n\\n Why Tiger Cub needed it, I couldn\u0027t imagine. As far as I could see, it was only ridden once or twice a year. Probably for the same reason as she needed a huge house to live in at the weekend. In any case, we arrived back in town before it was even two in the afternoon.\\n\\n Semyon handled the heavy two-wheeled vehicle like a master. I could never have done it, not even if I\u0027d activated the \u0027extreme skills\u0027 implanted in my memory and reviewed the reality lines. I could have got there almost as fast by expending a considerable portion of my reserves of power. But Semyon simply drove – and his superiority over an ordinary human driver was down to nothing but experience. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-62.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
