{"id":101371,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"But Semyon used the temporal freeze. He caught two of the dogs in the air: their bodies were left hanging there, enveloped in a blue glow, with their narrow, snarling muzzles reaching out. Saliva dripped from their fangs like gleaming blue hail. The three dogs who\u0027d been frozen on the ground weren\u0027t quite so impressive. Tiger Cub came running over to us. Her face was white, her eyes wide. She looked at Yulia for a moment, who was still whimpering, but she was getting quieter. \u0027Everyone okay?\u0027 Tiger Cub asked eventually. \u0027Fortunately,\u0027 mumbled Ilya, lowering his wand. \u0027What kind of animals are you keeping here?\u0027 \u0027They wouldn\u0027t have done anything,\u0027 Tiger Cub said ruefully. \u0027Oh yeah?\u0027 Semyon took Yulia out from under his arm and set her down on the ground. He pensively ran one finger over the bared fang of a dog hanging in mid-air. The film of the time freeze was springy and elastic under his hand. \u0027I swear!\u0027 said Tiger Cub, pressing her hand to her heart. \u0027Guys, Sveta, Yulia, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t have a chance to stop them. The dogs are trained to knock strangers down and restrain them.\u0027 \u0027Even Others?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Even Light Ones?\u0027 There was a note of uncertain respect in Semyon\u0027s voice. Tiger Cub dropped her eyes and nodded. Yulia went over, moved up close to her, and said more or less calmly: \u0027I wasn\u0027t frightened. Just taken by surprise, that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a good thing I was slow to react too,\u0027 Ilya commented, putting away his wand. \u0027Roast dog\u0027s too exotic a dish for me. But your dogs know me, Tiger Cub!\u0027 \u0027They wouldn\u0027t have touched you.\u0027 The tension slowly eased. Of course, nothing too serious would have happened, we know how to heal each other, but it would have been the end of the picnic. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Tiger Cub repeated. She looked at us all imploringly. \u0027But listen, why do you need all this?\u0027 asked Sveta, with a glance at the dogs. \u0027Can you explain that to me? Your powers are strong enough to beat off a platoon of Green Berets, what do you need Rottweilers for?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not Rottweilers, they\u0027re Staffordshire bull terriers.\u0027 \u0027What difference does that make?\u0027 \u0027They caught a burglar once. I\u0027m only here two days a week, I can\u0027t go back and forth to town all the time.\u0027 The explanation wasn\u0027t all that convincing. A simple frightening spell would have kept any ordinary people from coming anywhere near the place. But no one got a chance to say it – Tiger Cub got in first: \u0027It\u0027s just the way I am, okay?\u0027 \u0027How long are the dogs going to stay hanging there like that?\u0027 asked Yulia. \u0027I want to make friends with them. Otherwise I\u0027ll be left with a latent psychological complex that\u0027s bound to affect my personality and my sexual preferences.\u0027 Semyon snorted. Yulia\u0027s comment had finally defused the tension – but it was anybody\u0027s guess how spontaneous or calculated it had been. \u0027They\u0027ll start moving again before the evening. Well, hostess, are you going to invite us in?\u0027 We left the dogs where they were round the car and walked towards the house. \u0027What a great place you have, Tiger Cub!\u0027 said Yulia. She was ignoring the rest of us entirely now, clinging to the young woman. As if the sorceress was her idol and she could be forgiven for anything, even overvigilant guard dogs. Why is it that the powers we can\u0027t develop are always the ones that become an obsession? Yulia\u0027s a wonderful analytical sorceress. She can untangle the threads of reality and reveal the concealed magical causes of events that seem quite ordinary. She\u0027s really smart and everyone in the department loves her, not just as a sweet girl, but as a comrade-in-arms, a valued and sometimes quite irreplaceable colleague. But her idol is Tiger Cub, a shape-shifting sorceress, a combat magician. Why couldn\u0027t she look up to good-hearted old Polina Vasilievna, who worked in the analytical section part-time, or fall for the head of the department, the impressive middle-aged ladykiller Edik. But no, she\u0027d chosen Tiger Cub as her role model. I started whistling as I walked along at the back of the procession. I caught Svetlana\u0027s eye and gave her a quick nod. Everything was fine. We had entire days of doing nothing ahead of us. No Dark Ones or Light Ones, no intrigues and plots, no confrontations. Just swimming in the lake, sunbathing, eating kebabs from the barbecue and washing them down with red wine. And in the evening – the bathhouse. A big house like this had to have a good bathhouse. And then Semyon and I could take a couple of bottles of vodka and a jar of pickled mushrooms, get as far away as possible from the rest of the crowd and drink ourselves stupid, gazing up at the stars and making philosophical conversation on elevated subjects. Marvellous. I wanted to be a human being. For twenty-four hours at least. Semyon stopped and nodded to me. \u0027Let\u0027s take two bottles. Three, even. Someone else might decide to join us.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a deal,\u0027 I said. He hadn\u0027t been reading my thoughts, it was just that he had so much more experience of life than I did. \u0027It\u0027s easier for you,\u0027 Semyon added. \u0027I almost never get the chance to be a human being.\u0027 \u0027Do you need to?\u0027 Tiger Cub asked, halting by the door. Semyon shrugged: \u0027Of course not. But I kind of like the idea.\u0027 We went into the house. Twenty guests was a bit too much even for this house. If we\u0027d been ordinary people, it would have been different. But we were too noisy. Try bringing together twenty kids who\u0027ve been studying hard for months, give them the free run of a well-stocked toyshop, let them do anything they like and see what you end up with. Sveta and I were just about the only ones not really caught up in the boisterous fun and games. We each grabbed a glass of wine from the buffet table and settled down on a leather sofa in the corner of the sitting room. Semyon and Ilya locked horns in a magical duel. Very civilised and peaceful, amusing for the others who were watching – at first, that is. Semyon must have wounded his friend\u0027s vanity in the car: now they were taking it in turns to change the climate in the room. We\u0027d already had winter in the forest outside Moscow, and autumn mist, and summer in Spain. Tiger Cub had categorically forbidden any kind of rain, but the magicians weren\u0027t trying to summon up a violent display of the elements. They\u0027d obviously imposed some restrictions of their own on their range and the competition was less about who could produce the most unusual natural moment ever recorded than who could deliver something that suited the mood of the moment. Garik, Farid and Danila were playing cards. A perfectly standard game, without frills, but the air above the table was nevertheless sparkling with magic. They were using every possible magical means to cheat and protect themselves against each other\u0027s tricks. Ignat stood by the open doors, surrounded by women from the research department, with our useless programmers in tow. Our Casanova must have suffered some kind of romantic reversal, and he was now seeking comfort in a close circle of friends. \u0027Anton,\u0027 Sveta asked in a low voice, \u0027what do you think, is all this for real?\u0027 \u0027What exactly?\u0027 \u0027All this happy mood. You remember what Semyon said, don\u0027t you?\u0027 I shrugged: \u0027Can we come back to this when we get to be a hundred? I\u0027m feeling good. It\u0027s that simple. I don\u0027t have to go running off anywhere, I don\u0027t have to do any calculations. The Watches are lying low in the shade with their tongues hanging out.\u0027 \u0027I feel good too,\u0027 Svetlana agreed. \u0027But there are only four of us here who are young, or almost young. Yulia, Tiger Cub, you and me. What are we going to be like in a hundred years? Or in three hundred?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll have to wait and see.\u0027 \u0027Anton, listen to me,\u0027 Sveta said, touching my cheek lightly. \u0027I\u0027m very proud that I joined the Watch. I\u0027m happy that my mother\u0027s well again. My life\u0027s better now, no doubt about it. I can even understand why the boss put you through that ordeal . . .\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t, Sveta.\u0027 I took hold of her hand. \u0027Even I understood that, and I got the worst of it. Don\u0027t let\u0027s talk about it.\u0027 \u0027I wasn\u0027t going to,\u0027 Sveta said, and drained her wine glass. \u0027Anton, what I\u0027m trying to say is – I can\u0027t see any real joy.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 Sometimes I must seem incredibly thick-headed. \u0027Here. In the Night Watch. In our close, friendly team. After all, every day is just one more battle for us. A big one or a little one. With a crazed werewolf, with a Dark Magician, with all the powers of the Dark at once. Flex those sinews, jut out that chin, prepare to block that attack with your bare chest or squat on a hedgehog with your bare arse.\u0027 I snorted with laughter. \u0027Sveta, what\u0027s so bad about all that? Yes, we\u0027re soldiers. Every last one of us, from Yulia to Gesar. Sure, it\u0027s no great fun being at war. But if we withdraw, then . . .\u0027 \u0027Then what?\u0027 Sveta asked. \u0027Will the Apocalypse come? The forces of Good and Evil have been fighting each other for a thousand years. Tearing at each other\u0027s throats, setting armies of humans against each other – and all for the highest goals. But tell me, Anton, have people really not become any better in all that time?\u0027 \u0027Yes, they have.\u0027 \u0027And what about since the Watches were set up? Anton, my dear, you\u0027ve told me so many things, and not just you. That the most important battle is for people\u0027s souls, that we\u0027re preventing mass slaughter. But are we? People still kill each other. Far more than they used to two hundred years ago.\u0027 \u0027Are you trying to tell me that the work we do is actually harmful?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Sveta, with a weary shake of her head. \u0027No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m not that conceited. I was just trying to say that maybe we\u0027re simply the Light, and that\u0027s all there is to it. . . You know, they\u0027ve started selling fake New Year Tree decorations in Moscow. They look just like the real thing, but they don\u0027t bring people any joy at all.\u0027 She told the joke with a straight face, without even changing her tone of voice. She looked into my eyes. \u0027Do you understand what I mean?\u0027 \u0027I understand.\u0027 \u0027Maybe you do. The Dark Ones do less Evil,\u0027 said Svetlana. \u0027These mutual concessions of ours, good deed for bad deed, licences for murder and healing, those can all be justified, I\u0027m sure. The Dark Ones do less Evil than they used to, and we don\u0027t do Evil by definition. But what about humans?\u0027 \u0027What have they got to do with it?\u0027 \u0027What do you mean? It\u0027s them we\u0027re defending. Tirelessly, self-sacrificingly. So why aren\u0027t their lives getting any better? They do the work of the Dark themselves. Why? Maybe it\u0027s because we\u0027ve lost something, Anton. The faith Light Magicians used to have when they sent entire armies to their deaths, and marched in the front ranks themselves? The ability not just to defend people, but to bring them joy? What good are secure walls, if they\u0027re the walls of a prison? Humans have forgotten about genuine magic, they don\u0027t believe in the Dark, but they don\u0027t believe in the Light either! Yes, Anton, we are soldiers. But people only love the army when there\u0027s a war going on.\u0027 \u0027There is a war going on.\u0027 \u0027Who knows about it?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not just ordinary soldiers, I suppose,\u0027 I said. It never feels good to retreat from old, familiar positions, but there was no other way. \u0027More like hussars. Taram, taram, taram . . .\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-54.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
