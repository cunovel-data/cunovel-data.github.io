{"id":101360,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"Just in time: the Dark Magician came out of the doors and immediately dived into the Twilight. He made it look easy, but I saw how he managed it. The auras of people near him flared up, scattering dark sparks in all directions. If I\u0027d been in the human world, I\u0027d have seen people\u0027s faces distorted by a sudden pain in their hearts, or emotional distress – which is far more painful. The Dark Magician gazed around, looking for my trail. He knew how to extract power from people around him, but his general technique wasn\u0027t exactly great. \u0027Take it easy,\u0027 I said, pressing the barrel of the pistol against the magician\u0027s spine. \u0027Take it easy. You\u0027ve already found me. And I bet you\u0027re really pleased.\u0027 I held his wrist tight with my other hand so that he couldn\u0027t make any passes. All these jumped-up young magicians use a standard set of spells, the simplest and most powerful. And they require the precise co-ordination of both hands. The magician\u0027s palm was suddenly damp. \u0027You, you . . .\u0027 He still couldn\u0027t believe what had happened. \u0027You\u0027re Anton! You\u0027re outside the law!\u0027 \u0027Maybe so. But what good will that do you now?\u0027 He turned his head. In the Twilight his face was distorted, it had lost that attractive, genial look. He hadn\u0027t reached the stage of the complete Twilight makeover, like Zabulon, but even so, his face was no longer human. The jaw hung down too low, the mouth was wide, like a frog\u0027s, the eyes were close-set and dull. \u0027You\u0027re a real ugly specimen, my friend,\u0027 I said forcing the barrel into his back again. \u0027This is a pistol. It\u0027s loaded with silver bullets, although that\u0027s not strictly necessary. It\u0027ll work just as well in the Twilight world as in the human one – more slowly, but that won\u0027t save you. You\u0027ll be able to feel the bullet ripping through the skin and parting the fibres of your muscles, smashing the bone, tearing the nerves apart.\u0027 \u0027You won\u0027t do that!\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027Because then there\u0027d be no way you could get out of this!\u0027 \u0027Is that so? But right now there\u0027s still some kind of chance, is there? You know, the urge to squeeze this trigger is getting stronger all the time. Let\u0027s go, scumbag.\u0027 I helped the magician along with a few kicks as I led him into the narrow passage between two kiosks. The thick growth of blue moss covering their walls started twitching. The Twilight flora was keen to taste our emotions – my fury and his fear – but the mindless plants also had a strong instinct for self-preservation. The Dark Magician had plenty of that, too. \u0027Listen, what do you want from me?\u0027 he shouted. \u0027They gave us a briefing and told us to look for you! I was only following orders! I honour the Treaty, watchman!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not a watchman any longer!\u0027 I said, shoving him against the wall, into the tender embrace of the moss. Let it suck out a little bit of his fear, or we wouldn\u0027t be able to have a proper talk. \u0027Who\u0027s leading the hunt?\u0027 \u0027The Day Watch.\u0027 \u0027More specifically?\u0027 \u0027The boss, I don\u0027t know his name.\u0027 That was almost certainly true. But I knew the name. \u0027Were you sent to this particular station?\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027Answer,\u0027 I said, aiming the barrel at the magician\u0027s stomach. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Alone?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a lie. But it\u0027s not important. What were you ordered to do once you found me?\u0027 \u0027Observe.\u0027 \u0027Another He. But an important one this time. Think again and try a different answer.\u0027 The magician didn\u0027t say anything. The blue moss must have done too good a job. I squeezed the trigger and the bullet sang sweetly as it travelled across the metre of space between us. The magician had enough time to see it – his eyes opened wide in terror – which made them look a bit more human – and he jerked away, but too late. \u0027That\u0027s just a flesh wound to be going on with,\u0027 I said. \u0027Not fatal.\u0027 He writhed on the ground, pressing his hand against the ragged hole in his stomach. In the Twilight his blood was almost transparent, but maybe that was an optical illusion. Or maybe it was a peculiarity of this particular magician. \u0027Answer the question!\u0027 I swept my free hand through the air and set the blue moss around us on fire. Enough already, now we were going to work with fear, pain, despair. Enough mercy and compassion, enough polite conversation. This was the Dark, after all. \u0027We were ordered to report in and if possible to kill you.\u0027 \u0027Not detain me? Just kill me?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll accept that answer. Your means of communication?\u0027 \u0027By phone, that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027Let me have it.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s in my pocket.\u0027 \u0027Throw it.\u0027 He reached clumsily into his pocket, found the phone and threw it as best he could – the wound wasn\u0027t deadly, and the magician\u0027s resistance was still high, but the pain he was going through was hellish. Just the kind he deserved to suffer. \u0027What\u0027s the number?\u0027 I asked, catching the phone. \u0027It\u0027s on the emergency call key.\u0027 I glanced at the screen. From the initial numbers, the phone could have been absolutely anywhere. It was another mobile. \u0027Is that the field headquarters? Where is it?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t. . .\u0027 He paused, glancing at the pistol. \u0027Remember,\u0027 I encouraged him. \u0027They told me they\u0027d be here in five minutes.\u0027 All right! I took a look back over my shoulder, at the needle blazing brightly in the sky. It fitted perfectly. The magician moved. No, I hadn\u0027t deliberately provoked him by looking away. But when he took a wand out of his pocket – a short, crude device he obviously hadn\u0027t made himself, some cheap trash he\u0027d bought – I felt relieved. \u0027Well?\u0027 I asked when he froze, not daring to raise his weapon. \u0027Go for it!\u0027 The young magician didn\u0027t move, he didn\u0027t say a word. He knew if he tried to attack, I\u0027d empty the entire clip into him. And that would be fatal. But they were probably taught how to behave in a conflict with Light Ones. So he also knew it would be hard for me to kill someone \u0027who was unarmed and defenceless. \u0027Stand up to me,\u0027 I said. \u0027Fight! You son of a bitch, it never bothered you to destroy people\u0027s lives or attack defenceless people, did it? Well? Bring it on!\u0027 The magician licked his lips – his tongue was long and slightly forked. I suddenly realised what Twilight form he would eventually assume, and I felt sick. \u0027I throw myself on your mercy, watchman. I demand compassion and justice.\u0027 \u0027If I leave now, you\u0027ll be able to contact your base,\u0027 I said. \u0027Or you\u0027ll extract enough strength from people walking by to fix yourself up and get to a phone. Isn\u0027t that right? We both know it is.\u0027 The Dark One smiled and repeated: \u0027I demand compassion and justice, watchman!\u0027 I tossed the pistol from one hand to the other, looking into that smirking face. They were always ready to demand. But never to give. \u0027I\u0027ve always had problems understanding our side\u0027s double standard of morality,\u0027 I said. \u0027It\u0027s a difficult thing to come to terms with. It only comes with time, and that\u0027s something I haven\u0027t got much of. Coming up with all those excuses for when you can\u0027t protect everybody. When you know that every day someone in a special department signs licences for people to be handed over to the Dark Side. It\u0027s tough, you know.\u0027 The smile disappeared from his face. He repeated the same words, like an incantation. \u0027I demand compassion and justice, watchman.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not in the Watch any more,\u0027 I said. The pistol jerked and the breech clattered slowly, lazily spitting out the cartridge cases. The bullets slid through the air like a small swarm of angry wasps. He only screamed once, then two bullets shattered his skull. When the pistol clicked and fell silent, I reloaded the clip slowly, mechanically. The body on the ground in front of me was mangled and mutilated. It had already begun to emerge from the Twilight and the Twilight mask on the young face was dissolving. I waved my hand through the air, grasping and clutching at an imperceptible something flowing through space. The outside layer of it. A copy of the Dark Magician\u0027s human appearance. Tomorrow they\u0027d find him. The wonderful young man everybody loved. Brutally murdered. How much Evil had I just brought into the world? How many tears, how much bitterness and blind hate? Where did the chain of future events lead? And how much Evil had I killed? How many people would live longer and better lives? How many tears would never be spilled, how much malice would never be hoarded? How much hate would never even be born? Maybe I\u0027d stepped across the barrier that should never be crossed. And maybe I\u0027d understood where the next boundary was, the one that had to be crossed. I put the pistol back in its holster and left the Twilight. The sharp needle of the Ostankino Television Tower was still boring into the sky. \u0027Now let\u0027s try playing without any rules,\u0027 I said. \u0027Without any at all.\u0027 I managed to stop a car immediately, without even needing to give the driver an attack of altruism. Maybe that was because now I was wearing such a charming face, the face of the dead Dark Magician. \u0027Get me to the TV Tower,\u0027 I said as I climbed into the battered model-six Lada. \u0027As fast as you can, before they close the doors.\u0027 \u0027Going out for a bit of fun?\u0027 the driver asked with a smile. He was a rather dour-looking man in glasses. \u0027You bet,\u0027 I answered. \u0027You bet.\u0027 CHAPTER 5 THEY WERE still letting people in. I bought a ticket, paying the extra charge for the right to visit the restaurant, and set off across the green lawn round the tower. The last fifty metres of the path were covered by a feeble sort of canopy. I wondered why they\u0027d put it there. Maybe the old building sometimes shed chunks of concrete. The canopy ended at a booth where they checked ID. I showed mine and walked through the horseshoe frame of the metal detector – which wasn\u0027t working anyway. There were no more checks, that was all the protection this strategic target had. I was beginning to have serious doubts. I had to admit it was a strange idea to come here. I couldn\u0027t sense any concentration of Dark Ones nearby. If they really were here, then they were very well shielded, which meant I\u0027d have to deal with second- and third-grade magicians. And that would be suicide, pure and simple.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-43.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
