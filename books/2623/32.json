{"id":101349,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\u0027Galya, Lena, see you later,\u0027 I said to the girls. Galya twittered something polite, trying to look entirely absorbed in her work. Lena asked:\\n\\n \u0027Can I leave early today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n We don\u0027t lie to each other. If Lena asks, it means she really needs to leave early. We don\u0027t He. But sometimes we might just leave something unsaid . . .\\n\\n The boss\u0027s desk was in a state of total confusion. Pens, pencils, sheets of paper, printouts of reports, dull, exhausted magic crystals.\\n\\n But the crowning glory of this mess was a lit spirit lamp, with some white powder roasting over it in a crucible. The boss was stirring it thoughtfully with the tip of his expensive ink pen, obviously expecting this to produce some kind of effect. But the powder seemed to be doggedly ignoring both the heat and his stirring.\\n\\n \u0027Here.\u0027 I put the disk down in front of the boss.\\n\\n \u0027What are we going to do?\u0027 Boris Ignatievich asked without even looking up. He wasn\u0027t wearing a jacket, his shirt was crumpled and his tie had slid to one side.\\n\\n I stole a glance at the sofa. Olga wasn\u0027t in the office, but there was an empty champagne bottle standing on the floor, with two glasses.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t killed any Dark Ones. .. not these Dark Ones. You know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure, I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I can\u0027t prove it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By my reckoning we\u0027ve got two or three days,\u0027 said the boss. \u0027Then the Day Watch will bring a formal charge against you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wouldn\u0027t take much to arrange a false alibi.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And would you agree to that?\u0027 Boris Ignatievich enquired.\\n\\n \u0027Of course not. Can I ask one question?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where does this information come from? The photos and videos?\u0027\\n\\n The boss paused for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027I thought that would be it. You\u0027ve seen my dossier, Anton. Was it any less intrusive?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I suppose not. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking. Why do you allow information like that to be gathered?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t forbid it. Monitoring is carried out by the Inquisition.\u0027\\n\\n I just managed to bite back the stupid question: \u0027But does it really exist?\u0027 My face probably said it for me anyway.\\n\\n The boss carried on looking at me for a moment or two as if he was expecting further questions and then went on:\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get to the point, Anton. From this moment on you must never be left alone. Maybe you can go to the lavatory on your own, but at all other times you must have two or three witnesses with you. If we\u0027re lucky, there could be another killing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If I\u0027m really being set up, the killing won\u0027t happen until I\u0027m left without an alibi.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And we\u0027ll make sure you are left without one,\u0027 the boss said, laughing. \u0027What kind of old fool do you take me for?\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, still not sure, still not fully understanding.\\n\\n \u0027Olga . . .\u0027\\n\\n The door in the wall – the one I\u0027d always assumed led into a closet – opened and Olga came in, smiling as she straightened her hair. Her jeans and blouse sat tight on her body, the way they only do after a hot shower. Behind her I caught a glimpse of an immense bathroom with a jacuzzi and a panoramic window right across one wall – it must have been one-way glass.\\n\\n \u0027Olya, can you handle this?\u0027 the boss asked, obviously referring to something they\u0027d already talked about.\\n\\n \u0027On my own? No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh sure, of course I can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stand back to back,\u0027 the boss ordered.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t feel like arguing, but I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I knew something really serious was about to happen.\\n\\n \u0027And both of you open yourselves to me,\u0027 Boris Ignatievich demanded.\\n\\n I closed my eyes and relaxed. Olga\u0027s back was hot and damp, even through her blouse. A strange sensation, standing there touching a woman who\u0027s just been making love . . . but not with you.\\n\\n No, I wasn\u0027t the slightest bit in love with her. Maybe because I remembered her in her non-human form, maybe because we\u0027d become friends and partners so quickly. Maybe because of the centuries that separated her birth from mine: what did a young body mean, when you could see the dust of the centuries in the other person\u0027s eyes? We\u0027d become friends, and nothing more.\\n\\n But standing next to a woman whose body still remembers someone else\u0027s touch, pressing yourself against her – that\u0027s a strange feeling . . .\\n\\n \u0027Right, let\u0027s begin . . .\u0027 said the boss, perhaps a bit sharply. And then he uttered some words I didn\u0027t understand, in some ancient language that hadn\u0027t been used for thousands of years.\\n\\n Flying.\\n\\n It really was like flying. As if the ground had slipped away from under my feet and I\u0027d become weightless. An orgasm in free fall, LSD mainlined into the bloodstream, electrodes in the subcortical pleasure centres . . .\\n\\n I was swept away by a wild, unadulterated joy that came out of nowhere, and the world dimmed and blurred. I would have fallen, but the power from the boss\u0027s raised hands held Olga and me up on invisible strings, making us arch over and press ourselves against each other.\\n\\n And then the strings got tangled.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Anton,\u0027 said Boris Ignatievich, \u0027but we didn\u0027t have any time for hesitation or explanations.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I was dumbfounded, sitting there on the floor and staring at my hands, at those slim fingers with the two silver rings, at my legs – those long, shapely legs still damp after my shower, in jeans that were clinging too tight, at the blue and white trainers on my small feet.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not for long,\u0027 the boss said.\\n\\n \u0027What the—\u0027 I almost swore, jerking forward and trying to get to my feet, but the sound of my voice made me cut it short. A low, vibrant, soft woman\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \u0027Calm down, Anton.\u0027 The young man standing beside me reached out his hand and helped me up.\\n\\n If not for that, I\u0027d probably have fallen over. My centre of balance had completely changed. I was shorter, and the world looked quite different.\\n\\n \u0027Olga?\u0027 I asked, looking at what used to be my face. My partner, now the inhabitant of my body, nodded. Totally confused, I gazed into her . . . into my face and saw I hadn\u0027t shaved properly that morning. And there was a little, angry red pimple on my forehead that would have done credit to any teenage slob going through puberty.\\n\\n \u0027Calm down, Anton. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever changed sex too.\u0027\\n\\n Somehow I believed her. Despite her great age, Olga might never have found herself in this particular ticklish situation before.\\n\\n \u0027Have you got your bearings now?\u0027 the boss asked.\\n\\n I looked myself over again, first raising my hands to my face and then looking at my reflection in the glass doors of the shelves.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 said Olga, tugging at my arm. \u0027Just one moment, Boris. . .\u0027 Her movements were as uncertain as mine. Perhaps she was even less steady. \u0027Light and Dark, how do you men walk?\u0027 she suddenly exclaimed.\\n\\n It was then that the irony of the situation struck me and I started laughing. They\u0027d hidden me, the target of the Dark Side\u0027s plot, in a woman\u0027s body. In the body of the boss\u0027s lover, who was as old as St Basil\u0027s Cathedral!\\n\\n Olga pushed me into the bathroom – I couldn\u0027t help feeling quite pleased I was so strong – and bent me down over the jacuzzi. Then she squirted a jet of cold water straight in my face from the showerhead she\u0027d left lying ready on the soft-pink ceramic surface.\\n\\n I snorted and twisted free of her grip, suppressing the urge to smack her – or was it me, really? – across the face. The motor reflexes of this other body seemed to be waking up.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not hysterical,\u0027 I said. \u0027It really is funny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 Olga screwed up her eyes, looking hard at me. Was that really my expression when I was trying to look benevolent and doubtful at the same time?\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then take a look at yourself.\u0027\\n\\n I went across to the mirror, which was on the same massive scale as everything else in this secret bathroom, and looked at myself.\\n\\n It was weird. As I looked at my new shape, I began to feel entirely calm. The shock would probably have been worse if I\u0027d been in another man\u0027s body. But this was okay, it just felt like the beginning of a fancy-dress party.\\n\\n \u0027Are you influencing me at all?\u0027 I asked. \u0027You or the boss?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I must have pretty strong nerves then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve smudged your lipstick,\u0027 Olga commented. She laughed. \u0027Do you know how to put lipstick on?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you crazy? Of course not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll teach you. It\u0027s not that hard.\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER 2\\n\\n AFTER I LEFT the office I hesitated for a moment, fighting the temptation to go back in.\\n\\n I could reject the boss\u0027s plan at any moment. I only had to go back in and say a few words, and Olga and I would be returned to our own bodies. But in half an hour of conversation I\u0027d learnt enough for me to accept that this was the only way to handle this provocation by the Dark Ones.\\n\\n After all, it doesn\u0027t really make much sense to refuse life-saving treatment because the injections hurt.\\n\\n I had the keys to Olga\u0027s apartment in her handbag, together with money and her credit card in a little wallet, make-up, a handkerchief, a box of Tic-Tacs, a comb, a layer of various small items scattered on the bottom, a mirror, a tiny mobile phone . . .\\n\\n But the empty pockets of the jeans made me feel like I must have lost something. I rummaged in them for a second or two, trying to find at least a forgotten coin, but was soon convinced that Olga carried everything in her bag, the way most women do.\\n\\n You might have thought I\u0027d just lost things that were rather more important than the contents of my pockets. But it was a detail that irritated me, so I transferred a few banknotes from the handbag to my pocket and that made me feel a bit more confident.\\n\\n It was a shame Olga didn\u0027t carry a walkman, though.\\n\\n \u0027Hi,\u0027 said Garik, coming towards me. \u0027Is the boss free?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s . . . he\u0027s with Anton . . .\u0027 I replied.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened, Olya?\u0027 Garik asked, looking at me closely. I don\u0027t know what it was he\u0027d sensed: a different intonation, hesitant movement, a changed aura. But if a field operative that neither Olga nor I had ever spent much time with could sense the difference, I wasn\u0027t doing too well.\\n\\n And then Garik gave me a timid, uncertain smile. That was entirely unexpected: I\u0027d never noticed Garik trying to flirt with the Watch\u0027s female employees. He even has trouble getting to know normal women, he\u0027s so unlucky in love.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. We had a bit of an argument.\u0027 I turned away without saying goodbye and walked to the staircase. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-32.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
