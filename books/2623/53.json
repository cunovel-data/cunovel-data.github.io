{"id":101370,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","content":"Our analysts spent about twenty-four hours working on the theory that the unexpectedly hot weather had been caused by some move the Dark Ones were planning. No doubt at the same time the Day Watch were investigating whether we Light Magicians had interfered with the climate. When both sides became convinced the anomalous weather was due to natural causes, we were all left with absolutely nothing to do.\n The Dark Ones had turned as quiet as flies pinned down by rain. Despite all the doctors\u0027 forecasts, the number of accidents and natural deaths across the city fell. The Light Ones didn\u0027t much feel like working either, magicians squabbled over unimportant trivia, it took half a day to get the simplest documents out of the archives, and when the analysts were asked to forecast the weather they replied acidly with eighteenth-century gibberish such as: \u0027The water is dark in the clouds.\u0027 Boris Ignatievich wandered round the office in a stupor: even with his oriental origins and great experience of the East, he was floored by Moscow\u0027s own version of hot weather. The previous morning, Thursday, he\u0027d called all the staff together, appointed two volunteers from the Watch to assist him and told everyone else to clear out of the city. To go anywhere, the Maldives or Greece if we wanted, down to hell\u0027s own kitchen if we liked – even that would be more comfortable. Or just to a dacha outside town. We were told not to show up in the office again until Monday lunchtime.\n The boss waited for exactly a minute, until happy smiles had spread across everyone\u0027s faces, then added that it would be only fair for us to earn this unexpected break with an intensive spell of work. That way we wouldn\u0027t end up feeling guilty of having wasted the time. The title of the old classic was to the point, he said – \u0027Monday starts on Saturday\u0027. So having been granted three extra days of holiday, we had to get through all the routine work in the remaining time.\n And that\u0027s what we\u0027d been doing – getting through it. Some of us almost until the morning. We\u0027d checked up on the Dark Ones who were still in town and under special observation: vampires, werewolves, incubi and succubi, active witches, all sorts of troublesome low-level riff-raff. Everything was in order. What the vampires wanted right now wasn\u0027t hot blood, but cold beer. Instead of trying to cast spells on their neighbours, the witches were all trying to summon up a little rain over Moscow.\n But now we were on our way to relax. Not as far as the Maldives, of course – the boss had been too optimistic about the finance office\u0027s generosity. But even two or three days out of town would be great. We felt sorry for the poor volunteers who\u0027d stayed behind in the capital to keep watch with the boss.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to call home,\u0027 said Yulia. She\u0027d really livened up after Semyon exchanged the damp heat in the car for the cool sea air. \u0027Sveta, can I borrow your phone?\u0027\n I was enjoying the cool too. I glanced into the cars we were overtaking: in most of them the windows were rolled down, and the people glared at us with loathing, wrongly assuming that our ancient automobile had powerful air conditioning.\n \u0027The turn\u0027s coming up soon,\u0027 I said to Ilya.\n \u0027I remember. I drove here once before.\u0027\n \u0027Quiet!\u0027 Yulia hissed fiercely and started chatting on the phone. \u0027Mum, it\u0027s me! . . . Yes, I\u0027m here already . . . Of course, it\u0027s great! There\u0027s a lake here . . . No, it\u0027s shallow. Mum, I can\u0027t talk for long, Sveta\u0027s dad lent me his phone .. . No, there\u0027s no one else . .. Sveta? Just a moment.\u0027\n Svetlana sighed and took the phone from Yulia. She gave me a dark look and I tried to put on a serious expression.\n \u0027Hello, Aunty Natasha,\u0027 Svetlana said in a squeaky child\u0027s voice. \u0027. . . Yes, very pleased . . . Yes. . . No, with the grown-ups. Mum\u0027s a long way off, shall I call her? . . . Okay, I\u0027ll tell her. Definitely. Goodbye.\u0027\n She switched off the phone and spoke into empty space:\n \u0027So tell me, young lady, what\u0027s going to happen when your mother asks the real Sveta how the holiday went?\u0027\n \u0027Sveta will say we had a great time.\u0027\n Svetlana sighed and glanced at Semyon as if looking for support.\n \u0027Using magical powers for personal goals leads to unexpected consequences,\u0027 Semyon declared in a dry, official voice. \u0027I remember one time—\u0027\n \u0027What magic powers?\u0027 Yulia asked, genuinely surprised. \u0027I told my friend Sveta I was going off to a party with some guys and asked her to cover for me. She was shocked, but of course she said yes.\u0027\n In the driving seat Ilya laughed.\n \u0027Why wouldn\u0027t I want to go to a party?\u0027 Yulia asked indignantly, clearly not understanding what he found so funny. \u0027That\u0027s the way the human kids amuse themselves. So what are you laughing at?\u0027\n For every member of our Watch, work takes up the greater part of our lives. Not because we\u0027re workaholics – who wouldn\u0027t rather relax than work? And not because the work is so very interesting – we spend most of our time on boring patrol duty or polishing the seats of our trousers in the office. It\u0027s simply that there aren\u0027t enough of us. It\u0027s much easier for the Day Watch to keep up to strength, any Dark One is only too keen for a chance to wield power. But our situation\u0027s quite different.\n Outside work, though, every one of us has his own little piece of life that he won\u0027t give up to anyone: not to the Light and not to the Dark. That\u0027s all ours... A little piece of life that we don\u0027t hide, and don\u0027t put on display either. What\u0027s left of our original, essential human nature.\n Some go travelling whenever they can. Ilya, for instance, prefers ordinary package holidays, but Semyon likes hitchhiking. He once travelled from Moscow to Vladivostok without a single kopeck and in record time, but he didn\u0027t register his achievement with the League of Free Travellers, because he used his magical powers twice on the way.\n For Ignat – and he\u0027s not the only one – holidays are always about sex. It\u0027s a stage almost all of us go through, because Others get far more opportunities than humans do. It\u0027s a well-known fact that humans feel a powerful attraction to Others, even though they may not realise it.\n There are plenty of collectors among us too. From modest collectors of penknives, key-rings, stamps and cigarette lighters to collectors of weather, smells, auras and spells. I used to collect model cars, spending big money on rare models that only had value to a few thousand idiots. I dumped the entire collection into two cardboard boxes ages ago. I ought to take them out into the courtyard and tip them into the sandpit for the kids to enjoy.\n There are lots of hunters and fishermen. Igor and Garik are into extreme parachuting. Our useless programmer Galya, a sweet girl, is into growing bonsai trees. I guess we cover pretty much the entire range of entertainments that the human race has ever invented.\n But what Tiger Cub did in her spare time, I had no idea, even though it was her place we were going to. I was almost as keen to find out as I had been to escape from the scorching heat in town. When you spend a bit of time at someone\u0027s place, it usually doesn\u0027t take too long to find out what their special interest is.\n \u0027Are we almost there now?\u0027 Yulia asked in a capricious tone. We\u0027d already turned off the main highway and travelled about five kilometres along a dirt road, past a little dacha settlement and over a small river.\n \u0027Yes, we\u0027re almost there,\u0027 I answered, checking the image of the route that Tiger Cub had left with us.\n \u0027Actually, we\u0027re there already,\u0027 said Ilya, swerving the car off the road, straight at the trees. Yulia gasped and covered her face with her hands. Svetlana reacted more calmly, but even she put her hands out, expecting a crash.\n The car hurtled through thick bushes, over fallen branches and crashed into a solid wall of trees. But, of course, there was no impact. We leapt straight through the magical mirage and landed on a well-surfaced road. Straight ahead there was a small lake glinting like a bright mirror in the sun, with a two-storey brick house standing by the shore, surrounded by a tall fence.\n \u0027What always amazes me about shape-shifters,\u0027 said Svetlana, \u0027is how obsessed they are with secrecy. Not only does she hide behind a mirage, she has a fence too.\u0027\n \u0027Tiger Cub\u0027s not a shape-shifter!\u0027 Yulia objected. \u0027She\u0027s a transformer magician.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s the same thing,\u0027 Sveta said gently.\n Yulia looked at Semyon, clearly expecting him to back her up.\n \u0027Essentially Sveta\u0027s right. Highly specialised combat magicians are like any other shape-shifters. But with a plus sign instead of a minus. If Tiger Cub had been in a slightly different mood when she first entered the Twilight, she\u0027d have turned into a Dark shape-shifter. There are very few people whose path is completely determined in advance. There\u0027s usually a struggle during the preparation for initiation.\u0027\n \u0027And how was it with me?\u0027 asked Yulia.\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you before,\u0027 Semyon growled. \u0027It was pretty easy.\u0027\n \u0027A mild remoralisation of your teachers and parents,\u0027 Ilya said with a laugh as he stopped the car in front of the gates. \u0027And the little girl was immediately filled with love and kindness for the whole world.\u0027\n \u0027Ilya!\u0027 Semyon said sharply. He was Yulia\u0027s mentor, a rather lazy mentor who almost never interfered in the young sorceress\u0027s development, but he obviously didn\u0027t appreciate Ilya\u0027s unnecessary wisecracks.\n Yulia was a talented girl, and the Watch had high hopes for her. But not so high that she had to be driven through the tortuous labyrinth of moral logic at the same rate as Svetlana, a future Great Sorceress.\n Sveta and I must have had the same thought at the same time – we looked at each other. And after we looked, we turned our eyes away.\n We could feel a pressure on us, forcing us apart. I\u0027d be a third-grade magician for ever. Any moment now Sveta would outgrow me and in a short time – a very short time, because the Watch\u0027s management thought it was necessary – she would become a sorceress beyond classification.\n And then all we\u0027d have left would be friendly handshakes when we met and an exchange of cards on birthdays and Christmas.\n \u0027Are they asleep in there, or what?\u0027 Ilya asked indignantly. His mind wasn\u0027t distracted by our problems. He stuck his head out the window, and the car immediately filled with up with hot air, though at least it was clean. He waved his hand, looking into the camera at the gate, and sounded his horn.\n The gates started opening slowly.\n \u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 the magician snorted as he drove through.\n It was a large plot of land, thickly planted with trees. The striking thing was how they\u0027d managed to build the house without damaging the huge pines and firs. Apart from a small flowerbed beside a little fountain that wasn\u0027t working, there were no other signs of cultivation. There were already five cars on the concrete drive in front of the house. I recognised the old Niva that Danila drove out of stubborn patriotism, and Olga\u0027s sports car – how had she managed to drive over the dirt road in that? Standing between them was the battered station wagon belonging to Tolik and two other cars I\u0027d seen at the office, but I didn\u0027t know whose they were.\n \u0027They didn\u0027t bother to wait for us,\u0027 Ilya said crossly. \u0027They\u0027re already partying, while the best people in the Watch are still bouncing along the country roads.\u0027\n He switched off the engine and Yulia immediately screeched in delight:\n \u0027Tiger Cub!\u0027\n She scrambled right over me, opened the door and jumped out of the car.\n Semyon swore and followed her, moving incredibly fast. Just in time.\n I don\u0027t know where those dogs had been hiding. In any case, they were still camouflaged until the moment Yulia got out of the car. But as soon as her feet touched the ground, the light-brown shadows closed in on her from all sides.\n Yulia shrieked. She was more than powerful enough to deal with a pack of wolves, never mind five or six dogs, but she\u0027d never actually been in a genuine fight, and she lost her head. To be quite honest, even I hadn\u0027t been expecting an attack – not here. And especially not this kind. Dogs never attack Others. They\u0027re afraid of Dark Ones. They like Light Ones. You have to train an animal really long and hard in order to suppress its natural fear of a walking source of magic.\n Svetlana, Ilya and I scrambled out of the car. But Semyon beat us all to it. He grabbed hold of Yulia with one hand and made a pass in the air with the other. I thought he would use fright magic, or withdraw into the Twilight, or reduce the dogs to dust on the spot. A reflex response usually relies on the simplest spells. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-53.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
