It will be a long one, but you\u0027ll never get over this. You\u0027ll never stop asking yourself if every step you make is the right one.\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER 3\\n\\n MAXIM DIDN\u0027T like restaurants. That was just his character. He felt far more comfortable and relaxed in bars and clubs, even the more expensive ones, as long as they weren\u0027t too stiff\" and formal. Of course, there were some people who always behaved like red commissars negotiating with the bourgeoisie, even in the most upmarket restaurants: no manners and no wish to learn any. But then who did all those New Russians in the jokes have to model themselves on?\\n\\n Last night had to be smoothed over somehow, though. His wife had either believed his story about an \u0027important business meeting\u0027 or at least pretended that she did. But he was still suffering vague pangs of conscience. If only she knew. If she could only imagine who he really was and what it was he did.\\n\\n Maxim couldn\u0027t say anything, so he had no choice but to make amends for his absence the previous night by using the same methods as any decent man after a little affair. Presents, pampering, an evening out. For instance, at a posh restaurant with exotic cuisine, foreign waiters, elegant decor and an extensive wine list.\\n\\n Maxim wondered if Elena really thought he\u0027d been unfaithful to her the night before. The question intrigued him, but not enough for him to ask it out loud. There are always some things that have to be left unsaid. Maybe some day she\u0027d learn the truth. And then she\u0027d be proud of him.\\n\\n But his hopes on that score were probably in vain – he realised that. In a world full of the creatures of Malice and Darkness, he was the only knight of Light, eternally alone, unable to share with anyone the truth that was occasionally revealed to him. At the beginning, Maxim had still hoped to meet someone else like him: a sighted man in the kingdom of the blind, a shepherd who could sniff out the wolves in sheep\u0027s clothing from among the heedless herd.\\n\\n But there wasn\u0027t anyone. He had no one to stand beside him.\\n\\n Even so, he hadn\u0027t despaired.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think this is worth trying?\u0027\\n\\n Maxim glanced down at the menu. He didn\u0027t know what malai kqfta was. But that had never prevented him from making decisions. And in any case, the ingredients were listed.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, try it. Meat with a cream sauce.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Beef?\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t realise straight away that Elena was joking. Then he smiled back at her.\\n\\n \u0027Definitely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what if I do order something with beef?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then they\u0027ll refuse politely,\u0027 said Maxim. Keeping his wife amused wasn\u0027t so difficult. He actually rather enjoyed it. But right now he would really like to take a look round the room. Something here wasn\u0027t right. He could sense a strange, cold draught blowing through the semi-darkness at his back; it made him screw up his eyes and keep looking, looking . . .\\n\\n Could it really be?\\n\\n The gap between his missions was usually at least a few months, maybe six. Nothing had ever come up the very next day . . .\\n\\n But the symptoms were only too familiar.\\n\\n Maxim reached into his inside jacket pocket, as if he was checking his wallet. What he was really concerned about was something else – the little wooden dagger, carved artlessly but with great care. It was a simple whittled weapon he\u0027d played with as a child, without understanding what it was for at the time, thinking it was just a toy.\\n\\n The dagger was waiting.\\n\\n But who for?\\n\\n \u0027Max?\u0027 There was a note of reproach in Elena\u0027s voice. \u0027You\u0027re off in the clouds again.\u0027\\n\\n They clinked glasses. It was a bad sign for husband and wife to do that, it meant there\u0027d be no money in the family. But Maxim wasn\u0027t superstitious.\\n\\n Who was it?\\n\\n At first he suspected two girls. Both attractive, even beautiful, but each in her own way. The shorter one with dark hair, who moved in a slightly angular fashion, like a man, was overflowing with energy. She positively oozed sex. The other one, the blonde, was taller, more calm and restrained. And her beauty was quite different, soothing.\\n\\n Maxim felt his wife watching him and looked away.\\n\\n \u0027Lesbians,\u0027 his wife said disdainfully.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, just look at them! The small dark-haired one in jeans is totally butch.\u0027\\n\\n So she was. Maxim nodded and assumed an appropriate expression.\\n\\n Not them. Not them, after all. But who was it then?\\n\\n A mobile phone rang in the corner of the room and a dozen people automatically reached for their phones. Maxim located the source of the sound and caught his breath.\\n\\n The man talking into the phone in rapid, quiet bursts was not simply Evil. He was enveloped in a black shroud that other people couldn\u0027t see, though Maxim could sense it.\\n\\n The draught was coming from him, it smelled of danger, appalling danger, coming closer.\\n\\n Maxim felt a sudden ache in his chest.\\n\\n \u0027You know what, Elena, I\u0027d like to live on a desert island,\u0027 he blurted out before he realised what he was saying.\\n\\n \u0027Alone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With you and the children. But no one else. Not a soul.\u0027\\n\\n He gulped down the rest of his wine and the waiter immediately refilled his glass.\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t like that,\u0027 his wife said.\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n The dagger felt heavy and hot in his pocket now. The mounting excitement was acute, almost sexual. It demanded release.\\n\\n \u0027Do you remember Edgar Allen Poe?\u0027 Svetlana asked.\\n\\n They\u0027d let us in without any fuss. I hadn\u0027t been expecting that – the rules in restaurants must have changed, become more democratic, or maybe they were just short of customers.\\n\\n \u0027No. He died too long ago. But Semyon was telling me—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean Poe himself. I meant his stories.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Man of the Crowd?\u0027 I guessed.\\n\\n Svetlana laughed quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. You\u0027re in the same fix as him right now. You have to stick to crowded places.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fortunately I\u0027m not sick of those places just yet.\u0027\\n\\n We took a glass of Bailey\u0027s each and ordered something to eat. That probably gave the waiter ideas about why we were there – two inexperienced prostitutes looking for work – but I didn\u0027t really care.\\n\\n \u0027Was he an Other?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Poe? Probably an uninitiated one.\u0027\\n\\n Silence\\n\\n There are some qualities–some incorporate things,\\n\\n That have a double life, which thus is made\\n\\n A type of that twin entity which springs\\n\\n From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.\\n\\n Svetlana recited in a quiet voice.\\n\\n I looked at her in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know it?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027How can I put it?\u0027 I said. Then I raised my eyes and declaimed:\\n\\n He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!\\n\\n No power hath he of evil in himself;\\n\\n But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)\\n\\n Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,\\n\\n That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod\\n\\n No foot of man), commend thyself to God!\\n\\n We looked at each for a second and then both burst into laughter.\\n\\n \u0027A literary duel,\u0027 Svetlana said ironically. \u0027Score line: one–one. A pity we don\u0027t have an audience. But why wasn\u0027t Poe initiated?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A lot of poets are potential Others. But some potentials are best left to live as humans. Poe was too psychologically unstable – giving people like that special powers is like handing a pyromaniac a can of petrol. I wouldn\u0027t even try to guess which side he would have taken. He\u0027d probably have withdrawn into the Twilight for ever, and very quickly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But how do they live there? The ones who have withdrawn for ever?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, Svetlana. I expect no one really knows. You sometimes come across them in the Twilight world, but there\u0027s no contact in the usual sense of the word.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like to find out,\u0027 said Svetlana, casting a thoughtful glance round the room. \u0027Have you noticed the Other in here?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027The old man behind me, talking on his phone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you call him old?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s very old. I\u0027m not looking with my eyes.\u0027\\n\\n Svetlana bit her lip and screwed up her eyes. She was beginning to develop small ambitions of her own.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t do it yet,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027I can\u0027t even tell if he\u0027s Light or Dark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dark. Not from the Day Watch, but Dark. A magician with middle-level powers. And by the way, he\u0027s spotted us too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are we going to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Us? Nothing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he\u0027s Dark!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, and we\u0027re Light. What of it? As Watch agents we have the right to check his ID. But it\u0027s bound to be in order.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And when will we have the right to intervene?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When he gets up, waves his hands through the air, turns into a demon and starts biting off people\u0027s heads. . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anton!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m quite serious. We have no right to interfere with an honest Dark Magician\u0027s pleasant evening out.\u0027\\n\\n The waiter brought our order and we stopped talking. Svetlana ate, but without any real appetite. Then, like a sulky, capricious child, she blurted out:\\n\\n \u0027And how long is the Watch going to carry on grovelling like this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To the Dark Ones?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Until we acquire a decisive advantage. Until people who become Others no longer hesitate for even a moment over what to choose: Light or Dark. Until the Dark Ones all die of old age. Until they can no longer nudge people towards Evil as easily as they do now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s capitulation, Anton.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Neutrality. The status quo. Double deadlock – there\u0027s no point pretending otherwise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know, I like the solitary Maverick who\u0027s terrorising the Dark Ones a lot more. Even if he is violating the Treaty, even if he is setting us up without knowing it. He\u0027s fighting against the Dark, isn\u0027t he? Fighting! Alone, against all of them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And have you thought about why he kills Dark Ones but doesn\u0027t get in touch with us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-36.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
