And he knew that outside the empty apartment the fear would turn into terror.\n There was nothing that could save him. Nothing anywhere. But at least his home gave him the illusion of safety.\n Last night the world had crumbled, completely collapsed. Egor had always admitted quite openly – at least to himself, if not to others – that he wasn\u0027t really brave. But he wasn\u0027t exactly a coward either. There \u0027were some things it was only right to be afraid of: young thugs, maniacs, terrorists, disasters, fires, wars, deadly diseases. He thought of them all lumped together – and all equally distant. All these things really did exist, but at the same time they remained beyond his everyday experience. Follow simple rules, don\u0027t wander the streets at night, don\u0027t go into unfamiliar districts, wash your hands before eating, don\u0027t jump on the railway lines. It was possible to be afraid of unpleasant things and at the same time know there wasn\u0027t much chance they would mess up your life.\n Now everything had changed.\n There were some things you couldn\u0027t hide from. Things that shouldn\u0027t exist, that couldn\u0027t exist.\n But vampires did exist.\n He remembered it all distinctly, the horror hadn\u0027t wiped his memory clean, the way he\u0027d vaguely hoped it would yesterday, when he was running home, breaking the rules by running across the street without looking. And his timid hope that in the morning everything that had happened would turn out to be a dream had proved wrong too.\n It was all true. It couldn\u0027t possibly be true, but it was . . .\n It had happened yesterday. It had happened to him.\n He\u0027d been late coming home, sure, but he\u0027d come home later than that before. Even his parents who, Egor was quite certain, hadn\u0027t realised yet that he was almost thirteen, thought nothing of it.\n When he left the swimming pool with the other guys . . . yes, it was ten o\u0027clock already. They\u0027d all piled into McDonald\u0027s and sat there for about twenty minutes. That was the usual thing too, after training everyone who could afford it went to McDonald\u0027s. Then . . . then they all walked to the metro together. It wasn\u0027t far. Along a brightly lit street. Eight of them together.\n Everything was still fine then.\n It was in the metro that he\u0027d started feeling uneasy. He looked at his watch, stared round at the other passengers. But there was nothing suspicious.\n Except that Egor could hear music.\n And then things that couldn\u0027t happen had started happening.\n Without knowing why, he\u0027d turned into a dark, stinking alleyway. He\u0027d walked up to a girl and a young guy who were waiting for him. They\u0027d lured him there. And he offered his own neck to the girl, to her long, sharp fangs that weren\u0027t even human.\n Even now, at home on his own, Egor could feel that chill – that sweet, enticing tingle running across his skin. He\u0027d wanted it to happen! He\u0027d been afraid, but he\u0027d wanted the touch of the gleaming fangs, the sharp, short pain, and then . . . and then . . . there\u0027d be something else . . . there had to be . . .\n And no one in the whole world could help him. Egor remembered the way the woman who was walking her dogs had looked straight through him. An alert glance, not at all indifferent – she hadn\u0027t been frightened, she simply couldn\u0027t see what was happening. Egor had only been saved by the third vampire turning up. That pale guy with the walkman who\u0027d started trailing him back in the metro. They\u0027d fought over him the way hungry, full-grown wolves quarrel over a deer they\u0027ve cornered but not killed yet.\n Then everything had got confused, it all happened too fast. Someone had shouted something about some watch or other, about the twilight. There was a flash of blue light, and one vampire just crumbled into dust right there in front of his eyes, just like in the movies. The girl was howling because she\u0027d had something splashed into her face.\n Then he\u0027d fled in panic . . .\n And now he realised something terrible, even more terrible than what had happened: he couldn\u0027t tell anyone anything. They wouldn\u0027t believe him. They wouldn\u0027t understand.\n Vampires don\u0027t exist.\n It\u0027s not possible to look straight through people and not see them.\n Nobody just burns up in a swirl of blue flame, and turns into a dried mummy, a skeleton, a handful of ash.\n \u0027They do!\u0027 Egor told himself. \u0027They do exist. It is possible. It does happen!\u0027\n But even he could hardly believe it . . .\n Egor didn\u0027t go to school, but he did clean up the apartment. He wanted to do something. Several times he went across to the window and looked carefully round the yard.\n Nothing suspicious.\n But would he be able to see them?\n They would come. Egor didn\u0027t doubt it for a second. They knew he remembered them. Now they would kill him, because he was a witness.\n But they wouldn\u0027t just kill him. They\u0027d drink his blood and turn him into a vampire!\n The boy walked over to the bookshelf, where half the shelves were filled with videos. Maybe he could look for advice here. Dracula. Dead and Loving It – no, that was comedy. Once Bitten – total garbage. Night of Terror . . . Egor shuddered. He remembered that film. And now he\u0027d never dare watch it again. What was the line? \u0027A crucifix helps, if you believe in it.\u0027\n But how could a crucifix help him? He wasn\u0027t even baptised. And he didn\u0027t believe in God. At least, he hadn\u0027t believed before.\n Maybe he ought to start now.\n If vampires existed, then so did the devil, and if the devil existed, then did God too?\n If vampires existed, then so did God?\n If Evil existed, then so did Good?\n \u0027It\u0027s all rubbish,\u0027 said Egor. He stuck his hands into the pockets of his jeans, went out into the hallway and looked in the mirror. He saw his reflection. A bit miserable-looking, perhaps, but just a normal kid. That meant everything was still okay, so far. They hadn\u0027t managed to bite him.\n Just to make sure, he twisted this way and that, trying to see the back of his neck. No, there were no marks, nothing. Just a skinny neck, maybe not too clean . . .\n The idea suddenly hit him. Egor ran into the kitchen, frightening the cat off its comfortable spot on top of the washing machine. He started rummaging through bags of potatoes, onions and carrots.\n There it was, the garlic.\n Egor hastily peeled an entire head and started chewing it. The garlic was fierce, it burned his mouth. Egor poured a glass of tea and started taking a mouthful after every clove. It didn\u0027t help much, his tongue was on fire and his gums itched. But it was sure to help, wasn\u0027t it?\n The cat looked back into the kitchen, its eyes wide with apparent amazement, gave a disappointed miaow and stalked away, as if it couldn\u0027t understand how anyone could eat anything so disgusting.\n Egor chewed up the last two cloves, spat them out into his palm and started rubbing them on his neck. He could have laughed at himself for doing it, but he wasn\u0027t going to stop now.\n His neck started to sting too – it was good garlic. A single breath would be the end of any vampire.\n The cat began howling restlessly in the hallway. Egor pricked up his ears and peered out of the kitchen. No, nothing there. The door was secured with three locks and a chain.\n \u0027Stop that noise, Grey!\u0027 he told the cat sternly. \u0027Or I\u0027ll make you eat garlic too.\u0027\n The cat took the threat seriously and raced into the parents\u0027 bedroom. What else could he do? Silver was supposed to help. Egor frightened the cat again by going into the bedroom, opening the wardrobe and taking his mother\u0027s jewellery box out from under the sheets and towels. He took out a silver chain and put it on. It would smell of garlic, and he\u0027d have to take it off before evening. Maybe he should empty his moneybox and buy himself a chain. With a crucifix. And wear it all the time. Say he\u0027d started believing in God. Didn\u0027t it happen sometimes that people didn\u0027t believe for a long, long time, and then suddenly started believing after all?\n He walked across the sitting room, sat down with his feet up on the sofa and looked round the room thoughtfully. Did they have anything made of poplar wood? He didn\u0027t think so. And what did poplar wood look like, anyway? Maybe he should go to the botanical gardens and cut himself a dagger from a branch.\n That was all great, in theory, but what good would it do? If the music started playing again . . . that soft, alluring music . . . What if he took the chain off himself, broke the poplar-wood dagger and washed the garlic off his own neck?\n Soft, gentle music . . . invisible enemies. Maybe they were already there with him. He simply couldn\u0027t see them. He didn\u0027t know how to look. And a vampire might be sitting right there, laughing at him, looking at this naïve kid preparing his defences. And he wasn\u0027t afraid of any poplar stake, he wasn\u0027t scared by the garlic. How could you fight against something invisible?\n \u0027Grey!\u0027 Egor called. The cat didn\u0027t respond to the usual \u0027kss-kss\u0027, he was an awkward character. \u0027Come here, Grey!\u0027\n The cat was standing in the doorway of the bedroom. His fur was standing on end and his eyes were blazing. He was looking past Egor, into the corner, at the armchair beside the coffee table. At an empty chair . . .\n The boy felt the familiar chilly shiver run over his body. He jerked forward so violently that he went flying off the sofa and landed on the floor. The armchair was empty. The apartment was empty and locked. Everything turned dark, as if the sunlight outside the window had suddenly dimmed . . .\n There was someone there with him.\n \u0027No!\u0027 Egor shouted, crawling away. \u0027I know! I know you\u0027re here!\u0027\n The cat gave a hoarse screech and darted under the bed.\n \u0027I can see you,\u0027 shouted Egor. \u0027Don\u0027t touch me!\u0027\n The entrance of the building looked gloomy and miserable enough. But viewed from inside the Twilight, it was a genuine catacomb. Concrete walls that were simply dirty in ordinary reality were overgrown with a dark blue moss in the Twilight. Disgusting. There clearly wasn\u0027t a single Other living here to clean up ... I passed my hand over a really thick growth – the moss stirred, trying to creep away from the warmth.\n \u0027Burn!\u0027 I ordered it.\n I don\u0027t like parasites. Not even if they don\u0027t do any particular harm and only feed on other creatures\u0027 emotions. No one\u0027s ever proved the hypothesis that large colonies of blue moss are capable of unbalancing the human psyche and causing depression or mania. But I\u0027ve always preferred to play safe.\n \u0027Burn!\u0027 I repeated, transmitting a small amount of power through my hand.\n A hot, transparent flame spread across the layer of tangled blue felt. A moment later the entire entrance was ablaze. I stepped away towards the lift, pressed the button and got in. The cabin was a lot cleaner.\n \u0027Ninth floor,\u0027 Olga prompted. \u0027Why waste your powers like that?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just small change . . .\u0027\n \u0027You might need everything you\u0027ve got. Let it grow.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t answer. The lift crawled slowly upwards – the Twilight lift, the double of the ordinary one that was still standing on the first floor.\n \u0027Suit yourself,\u0027 said Olga. \u0027The uncompromising passion of youth . . .\u0027\n The doors opened. The fire had already reached the ninth floor and the blue moss was blazing wildly. It was warm, a lot warmer than it usually is in the Twilight. There was a slight smell of burning.\n \u0027That door there,\u0027 said Olga.\n \u0027I can see.\u0027\n I could sense the boy\u0027s aura behind the door. He hadn\u0027t even taken the risk of coming out today. Excellent. The goat was tethered with a strong rope, all we had to do was wait for the tiger.\n \u0027I suppose I\u0027ll go in,\u0027 I said. I pushed the door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-12.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
