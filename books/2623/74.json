{"id":101391,"no":74,"title":"Page 74","content":"Probably the effect would only be temporary; after all, I didn\u0027t want to delve too deep into Mum\u0027s mind. But at least I could count on a couple of months of peace and quiet. And so could my dad; I\u0027m my dad\u0027s daughter – I love him much more than I do my mum. It\u0027s only kids who can\u0027t tell you who they love more, their mum or their dad; adults have no problem answering the question . . .\\n\\n When I was done, I removed the half-formed black vortex, and it drifted out through the walls, looking for someone else to attach itself to. I took a breath and cast a critical eye round the hall.\\n\\n It hadn\u0027t been cleaned for a long time. The blue moss had crept back over everything again, and it was thickest of all round our door. That was only to be expected; with Mum\u0027s hysterical fits there was always something for it to feed on. When I was little I used to think the Light Ones planted the moss to annoy us. Then I was told that the blue moss is native to the Twilight, a parasite that lives on human emotions.\\n\\n \u0027Ice!\u0027 I commanded, flinging out my hand. The cold obediently gathered at my fingertips and ran across the walls like a stiff brush. Frozen needles of moss dropped to the floor, decaying instantly.\\n\\n Take that!\\n\\n That will teach you to go feeding on people\u0027s petty little thoughts!\\n\\n That\u0027s real power, the power of an Other.\\n\\n I emerged from the Twilight – in the human world less than two seconds had gone by – and straightened my hair. My forehead was damp, I had to take out my handkerchief and blot the sweat away. And of course, when I looked in my mirror I could see that my mascara was smudged.\\n\\n I had no time to fuss over how I looked. I just threw on a light veil of attractiveness that would prevent any human being from noticing the faults in my make-up. We call them \u0027paranjahs\u0027, and everybody likes to tease Others who wear them, but we all do anyway. When we\u0027re short of time or we need to be absolutely sure of making a good impression, or sometimes just for fun. There\u0027s a pretty young witch from Pskov who can\u0027t really do anything right except throw on a paranjah, and she\u0027s been working as a model for three years. She makes her living from it. The only trouble is that the spell doesn\u0027t work in photographs or on video, so she has to keep turning down all the offers she gets to work in advertising . . .\\n\\n Everything was against me today. The lift didn\u0027t come for ages, and the other one\u0027s been out of order for a long time now; and on my way out of the lobby I ran into Vitalik, the young guy who lives above us. When he saw me in my paranjah, he just froze with a stupid smile on his face. He\u0027s been in love with me since he was thirteen – stupidly, hopelessly, silently in love. To be honest, it\u0027s all because of my sloppy work. I was learning the love spell and decided to practise on our neighbours\u0027 little boy, since he took every chance he could get to ogle me while I was sitting on the balcony, sunbathing in my bikini. Well ... I practised. And I missed out the limiting factors. So he fell in love for ever. When he doesn\u0027t see me for a long time, it all seems to pass off, but it only takes one sight of me, and it all starts up again. He\u0027ll never be happy in love.\\n\\n \u0027Vitalik, I\u0027m in a hurry,\u0027 I said, smiling at him.\\n\\n But he just stood there, blocking the doorway. Then he decided to pay me a compliment.\\n\\n \u0027Alisa, you look really beautiful today . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks.\u0027 I gently moved him aside and felt him tremble when my hand touched his shoulder. He\u0027ll probably remember that touch for a week . . .\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve passed my last exam, Alisa!\u0027 he said quickly, talking to my back. \u0027That\u0027s it, I\u0027m a student now!\u0027\\n\\n I turned and took a closer look at him.\\n\\n Was this boy who still used anti-pimple lotion getting crazy ideas into his head? Was he hoping that now he\u0027d got into college and launched into \u0027adult life\u0027 he could have aspirations?\\n\\n \u0027Skiving out of the army?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Men today have no balls. They\u0027re all wimps. They don\u0027t want to do their time and get a bit of experience, and then go and study.\u0027\\n\\n His smile was slowly fading. It was a wonderful sight!\\n\\n \u0027Ciao, Vitalik,\u0027 I said and skipped out into the sweltering heat of summer. But my mood was a bit better now.\\n\\n These little lovesick pups are always fun to watch. They\u0027re boring to flirt with and actually having sex with them is disgusting, but just watching them is pure pleasure. I ought to give him a kiss some time . . .\\n\\n But anyway, a moment later I\u0027d entirely forgotten my lovesick neighbour. I stuck out my hand. The first car drove straight past – the driver looked at me with greedy longing in his eyes, but his wife was sitting beside him. The next car stopped.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going into the centre,\u0027 I said, leaning down towards the window. \u0027Manege Square.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get in,\u0027 said the driver, reaching across and opening the door. He was an educated-looking man with dark hair, about forty. \u0027How could I refuse such a good-looking girl a lift?\u0027\\n\\n I slipped into the front seat of the old Zhiguli 9 and turned the window all the way down. The breeze hit me in the face – that was some relief at least.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d have got there quicker on the metro,\u0027 the driver warned me honestly.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like the metro.\u0027\\n\\n The driver nodded. I liked him – he wasn\u0027t staring too brazenly, even though I\u0027d obviously overdone things with the paranjah, and the car was well cared for. And he had quite beautiful hands. They were strong, and their grip on the wheel was gentle but firm.\\n\\n What a shame I was in a hurry.\\n\\n \u0027Are you late for work?\u0027 the driver asked. He spoke very politely, but in a manner that was somehow personal and intimate. Maybe I ought to give him my number? I\u0027m a free girl now, I can do what I like.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wonder, what kind of jobs do such beautiful girls do?\u0027 It wasn\u0027t even an attempt to strike up an acquaintance or a compliment, it was genuine curiosity.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know about the others, but I work as a witch.\u0027\\n\\n He laughed.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a job like any other . . .\u0027 I took out my cigarettes and my lighter. The driver gave me a fleeting glance of disapproval, so I didn\u0027t bother to ask. I just lit up.\\n\\n \u0027And what are a witch\u0027s duties?\u0027\\n\\n We turned off onto Rusakov Street and the driver accelerated. Maybe I was going to be on time after all?\\n\\n \u0027It varies,\u0027 I replied evasively. \u0027But basically we oppose the forces of Light.\u0027\\n\\n The driver seemed to have accepted the rules of the game, although it wasn\u0027t really a game at all.\\n\\n \u0027So you\u0027re on the side of the Shadow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Dark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s great. I know another witch, my mother-in-law,\u0027 the driver said with a laugh. \u0027But she\u0027s already retired, thank God. So why don\u0027t you like the forces of Light?\u0027\\n\\n I stealthily checked out his aura. No, everything was okay, he was a human being.\\n\\n \u0027They get in our way. Tell me, for instance – what\u0027s the most important thing in life for you?\u0027\\n\\n The driver thought for a second.\\n\\n \u0027Just life itself. And for nobody to stop me living it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 I agreed. \u0027Everyone wants to be free, don\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Well, we witches fight for freedom too. For everyone\u0027s right to do what they want.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what if someone wants to do evil?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s his right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what if he infringes other people\u0027s rights in the process? Say I stab someone and infringe his rights?\u0027\\n\\n This was funny. We were straight into the classic dispute on the subject \u0027What is the Light and what is the Dark?\u0027 We Dark Ones and those who call themselves the Light Ones – we all brainwash our novices on this subject.\\n\\n \u0027If someone tries to infringe your rights, then simply stop them from doing it. You have that right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I get it. The law of the jungle. Whoever\u0027s stronger is right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stronger, cleverer, more farsighted. And it\u0027s not the law of the jungle. It\u0027s just the law of life. Is it ever any different?\u0027\\n\\n The driver thought about it and shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027No, it isn\u0027t. So I have the right to turn off the road somewhere, throw myself on you and rape you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But are you sure you\u0027re stronger than me?\u0027\\n\\n We\u0027d just stopped at a red light and the driver looked at me closely. He shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027No . . . I\u0027m not sure. But the reason I don\u0027t attack girls isn\u0027t because they might fight back!\u0027\\n\\n He was beginning to get a bit nervous. The conversation seemed like a joke, but he could sense that something wasn\u0027t right.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s also because they might put you in jail,\u0027 I said. \u0027And that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said firmly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said with a smile. \u0027That\u0027s exactly the reason. You\u0027re a normal, healthy man, with all the right reactions. But there\u0027s a law, so you prefer not to attack girls, but date them first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Witch . . .\u0027 the driver muttered with a crooked smile. He stepped hard on the accelerator.\\n\\n \u0027Witch,\u0027 I confirmed. \u0027Because I tell the truth and don\u0027t play the hypocrite. After all, everyone wants to be free to live his or her life. To do what they want. Not everything works out, after all, everyone has their own desires – but everyone has the same aspirations. And it\u0027s the clash of these that gives rise to freedom! A harmonious society in which everybody wants to have everything, although they have to come to terms with other people\u0027s desires.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what about morality?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What morality?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Universal human morality.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n There\u0027s nothing better than forcing someone into a dead-end and making him formulate his question properly. People don\u0027t usually think about the meaning of their words. It seems to them that words convey truth, that when someone hears the word \u0027red\u0027 he will think of a ripe raspberry, and not a pool of blood, that the word \u0027love\u0027 will bring to mind Shakespeare\u0027s sonnets and not the erotic films of Playboy. And they find themselves baffled when the word they\u0027ve spoken doesn\u0027t evoke the right response.\\n\\n \u0027There are basic principles,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027Dogmas. Taboos. The . . . what do they call them . . . Commandments.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 I said encouragingly.\\n\\n \u0027Thou shalt not steal.\u0027\\n\\n I laughed. And the driver smiled too.\\n\\n \u0027Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u0027s wife.\u0027 His smile was really broad now.\\n\\n \u0027And do you manage it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you even manage not to \"covet\"? You control your instincts that well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Witch!\u0027 the driver said enthusiastically. \u0027All right, I repent, I repent . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t repent!\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027It\u0027s quite normal. It\u0027s freedom! Stealing . . . and coveting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thou shalt not kill!\u0027 the driver declared. \u0027Eh? What do you say to that? A universal commandment!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You might as well say \"don\u0027t boil a young goat in its mother\u0027s milk\". Do you watch TV and read the newspapers?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes. But I don\u0027t enjoy it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why do you call \"Thou shalt not kill\" a commandment? Thou shalt not kill ... It was in the news this morning – down south they\u0027ve taken another three people hostage and they\u0027re demanding a ransom. They\u0027ve already cut a finger off each of them to show they\u0027re serious about their demands. And one of the hostages, by the way, is a three-year-old girl. They cut her finger off too.\u0027\\n\\n The driver\u0027s fingers tightened their grip on the wheel and he turned pale. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-74.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
