{"id":101377,"no":60,"title":"Page 60","content":"They\u0027d screwed something up. Failed to pull off some grand scheme in the struggle against the Dark.\\n\\n And now they were willing to hurl a new recruit into the breach.\\n\\n For the sake of humans who couldn\u0027t give a damn for the Light or the Dark.\\n\\n They were driving her through all the hoops an Other is supposed to jump through. They\u0027d already raised her powers to the third grade, now they were working on her mind. Very, very fast.\\n\\n There had to be a place for me somewhere in this insane pursuit of an unknown goal. Gesar made use of everything that came to hand, including me. Whatever I did – hunting vampires, chasing down the Maverick, talking to Sveta in Olga\u0027s body – all that had just been playing into the boss\u0027s hands.\\n\\n Whatever I did now was bound to have been foreseen too.\\n\\n My only hope was that not even Gesar was capable of foreseeing everything.\\n\\n That I could find the only way that would ruin his great plan for Sveta\u0027s powers.\\n\\n And avoid causing Evil in the process. Because if I did, it would be the Twilight for me.\\n\\n But in any case, I\u0027d be doing Sveta a huge favour.\\n\\n I caught myself standing with my cheek pressed against the trunk of a scrawny pine tree. Standing there, hammering my fist against the wood. In fury or in grief, I couldn\u0027t tell which. I held my scratched and bloody hand. But the sound didn\u0027t stop. It was coming from somewhere in the forest, from the very edge of the magical barrier around the house. Blows in the same rhythm, a rapid, nervous drumbeat.\\n\\n I lowered my head and ran between the trees, like an adult still playing at paintball. I already had a pretty good idea of what I\u0027d see.\\n\\n There was a tiger leaping around in a small clearing. Or rather, a tigress. Her black and orange coat gleamed in the rays of the rising sun. The tigress didn\u0027t notice me, right then she wasn\u0027t capable of noticing anything. She ran between the trees, the sharp daggers of her claws ripping at the bark. White scars appeared on the pine trees. Occasionally she stopped, rose up on her hind legs and started slashing at the trunks with her claws.\\n\\n I set off slowly back to the house.\\n\\n We all of us let off steam the best way we can. We all of us have to struggle, not just against the Dark, but against the Light too. Because sometimes it blinds us.\\n\\n But don\u0027t feel sorry for us: we\u0027re proud, very proud. Soldiers in the world war between Good and Evil, eternal volunteers.\\n\\n CHAPTER 4\\n\\n THE YOUNG man walked into the restaurant as confidently as if he came there every day for breakfast. But that wasn\u0027t so.\\n\\n He went straight over to the table where the short, swarthy-faced man was sitting, as if they\u0027d known each other for a long time. But that wasn\u0027t true either. With his last step he sank smoothly to his knees. He didn\u0027t slump, he lowered himself calmly, without losing his dignity or bending his back.\\n\\n The waiter who was walking past swallowed and turned away. He\u0027d seen all sorts of things in his time, let alone petty incidents like a mafia underling kowtowing to his boss. Only the young man didn\u0027t look much like an underling, and the older man didn\u0027t look much like a mafia boss.\\n\\n The trouble he could smell in the air threatened to be far more serious than a mobsters\u0027 shoot-out. He didn\u0027t know what exactly was going to happen, but he could feel it coming, because he was an Other himself, although he wasn\u0027t initiated.\\n\\n But only a moment later he had completely forgotten the scene he\u0027d just witnessed. He had nothing but a vague sense of unease somewhere near his heart, but he couldn\u0027t remember why.\\n\\n \u0027Get up, Alisher,\u0027 Gesar said in a low voice. \u0027Get up. We don\u0027t do that round here.\u0027\\n\\n The young man got up off his knees and sat down facing the Night Watch chief. He nodded.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t either. Not any more. But my father asked me to go down on my knees to you, Gesar. He followed the old rules. He would have knelt. But now he never will.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you know how he died?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 Yes. I saw with his eyes, heard with his ears, suffered his pain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Give me also his pain, Alisher, son of a devona and a human woman.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take what you ask, Gesar, Exterminator of Evil, equal of the gods, who do not exist.\u0027\\n\\n They looked into each other\u0027s eyes. Then Gesar nodded.\\n\\n \u0027I know the killers. Your father will be avenged.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I must be the one to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, you will not be able to do it, and you have no right. You have come to Moscow illicitly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take me into your Watch, Gesar.\u0027\\n\\n The head of the Night Watch shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027I was the best in Samarkand, Gesar,\u0027 the young man said, staring hard at him. \u0027Don\u0027t smile, I know that here I would be the lowest of the low. Take me into the Watch. As a pupil of your pupils. As a guard dog. I ask this in honour of my father\u0027s memory – take me into the Watch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are asking too much, Alisher. You are asking me to give you your death.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have already died, Gesar. When they drank my father\u0027s soul, I died with him. I walked along with a smile while he distracted the Dark Ones. I walked into the metro while they were trampling his ashes underfoot. Gesar, I have a right to ask this.\u0027\\n\\n Gesar nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Let it be so. You are a member of my Watch, Alisher.\u0027\\n\\n Not a trace of emotion showed in the young man\u0027s face, but he nodded and pressed his hand to his heart for an instant.\\n\\n \u0027Where is the thing that you have brought, Alisher?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have it, my lord.\u0027\\n\\n Gesar reached across the table without speaking.\\n\\n Alisher opened the small bag on his belt and took out a rectangular bundle of coarse fabric, handling it with great care.\\n\\n \u0027Take it, Gesar, and relieve me of my duty.\u0027\\n\\n Gesar covered the young man\u0027s open palm with his hand and closed his fingers. When the young man withdrew his hand a moment later, it was empty.\\n\\n \u0027Your service is completed, Alisher. Now let us simply relax. Let us eat, drink and remember your father. I will tell you all that I can remember.\u0027\\n\\n Alisher nodded. It was impossible to tell if he was pleased by what Gesar said or simply willing to accept whatever he suggested.\\n\\n \u0027We will have half an hour,\u0027 Gesar stated simply. \u0027Then the Dark Ones will arrive. They must have picked up your trail, even if they did so too late.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will there be a battle, my lord?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do not know,\u0027 Gesar replied with a shrug. \u0027What does it matter? Zabulon is far away. I have no reason to fear the others.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There will be a battle,\u0027 Alisher said thoughtfully. He looked round the restaurant.\\n\\n \u0027Drive all the customers away,\u0027 Gesar advised him. \u0027Gently, unobtrusively. I wish to observe your technique. And we will relax while we wait for our guests.\u0027\\n\\n About eleven everyone started waking up.\\n\\n I was waiting on the terrace, lazing in a lounger with my legs stretched out, taking occasional sips from a tall gin and tonic and savouring the sweet pain of a masochist. Every time someone came out through the doors, I greeted them with a friendly wave and a little rainbow that sprang from my spread ringers and went soaring up into the sky. It was a bit of childish fun, and everybody smiled. When Yulia saw my greeting, she stopped yawning, squealed and replied with a rainbow of her own. We competed with each other for a couple of minutes, and then made a rainbow together, a big one that stretched away into the forest. Yulia told me she was going to go and look for the crock of gold, and she strode off proudly under the multicoloured arch, with one of the terriers running obediently at her feet.\\n\\n I was waiting for certain people.\\n\\n The first to emerge was Lena. Bright and cheerful, wearing just her swimsuit. When she saw me she was embarrassed for a moment, but then she nodded and ran towards the gates. I enjoyed watching the way she moved: slim and graceful, full of life. Now she\u0027d dive into the cool water, swim on her own for a while and come back for breakfast with a keen appetite.\\n\\n Next to appear was Ignat. In his swimming trunks and flip-flops.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Anton!\u0027 he shouted happily. He came over, pulled open the next lounger and flopped down into it. \u0027How\u0027re you doing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m in fighting mood!\u0027 I told him, raising my glass.\\n\\n \u0027Good man.\u0027 Ignat looked around for a bottle and didn\u0027t see one. He reached out and took a sip from my glass. \u0027Too weak, too much mixer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I got plastered yesterday.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In that case you\u0027re right, better watch yourself,\u0027 Ignat advised me. \u0027We were on champagne all evening. Then we moved on to cognac later. I was afraid I\u0027d have a hangover, but I\u0027m okay. I seem to have got away with it.\u0027\\n\\n It was impossible to be offended by him.\\n\\n \u0027Ignat, what did you want to be when you were a kid?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027A hospital attendant.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, they told me boys couldn\u0027t be nurses, and I wanted to help sick people. So I decided that when I grew up I was going to be a medical attendant.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Great,\u0027 I said. \u0027But why not a doctor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too much responsibility for me,\u0027 Ignat admitted. \u0027And you had to study for too long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So did you get to be a medical attendant?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. I was in an ambulance crew, a psychiatric team. All the doctors loved working with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Firstly, because I\u0027m really charming,\u0027 Ignat explained ingenuously. \u0027I can talk to both men and women in a way that seems to calm them down and make them agree to go to hospital. And secondly, I could tell when someone was really ill and when he was just seeing something invisible to others. Sometimes I was able to whisper in the doctor\u0027s ear, explain that everything was okay and no injections would be required.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Medicine has suffered a great loss.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027True,\u0027 Ignat said with a sigh, \u0027but the boss persuaded me that I\u0027d be more useful in the Watch. And that\u0027s right, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m bored already,\u0027 Ignat drawled. \u0027Aren\u0027t you bored? I want to get back to work.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I do too. Ignat, have you got a hobby? Outside of work?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you interrogating me for?\u0027 he asked in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m curious. Or is it a secret?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What secrets do we have?\u0027 Ignat asked with a shrug. \u0027I collect butterflies. I\u0027ve got one of the best collections in the world. It fills two entire rooms.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very worthy,\u0027 I agreed.\\n\\n \u0027Come round some time and take a look,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027Bring Sveta, she tells me she likes butterflies too.\u0027\\n\\n I laughed so long even Ignat got the point. He got up, smiling uncertainly, and muttered:\\n\\n \u0027I think I\u0027ll go help get breakfast ready.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good luck,\u0027 was all I said. But I just couldn\u0027t help myself, and when Ignat reached the door, I called to him: \u0027Listen, is the boss right to be worried about Sveta?\u0027\\n\\n He propped his chin on his hand and thought for a moment. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-60.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
