{"id":101382,"no":65,"title":"Page 65","content":"It fitted.\n I closed the file and switched off the laptop. Then I sat there for a while, chewing things over. Then I looked at the clock.\n It was almost time for me to set out for our rendezvous.\n I took a shower and changed my clothes. I took three amulets with me: Zabulon\u0027s medallion, my Night Watch badge and a combat disc Ilya had given to me – an ancient round piece of bronze a bit bigger than a five-rouble coin. I\u0027d never used the disc before. Ilya had told me the amulet only had one charge left – maybe two at the most.\n I took my pistol out of its hiding place and checked the clip. Explosive silver bullets. Good against werewolves, of doubtful use against vampires, entirely effective against Dark Magicians.\n As if I were going off to war, not for a talk with my boss.\n My phone rang in my pocket when I was already at the door.\n \u0027Anton?\u0027\n \u0027Sveta?\u0027\n \u0027Olga wants to talk to you, I\u0027ll give her the phone.\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 I agreed, unlocking the door.\n \u0027Anton, I love you very much. Please don\u0027t do anything stupid,\u0027 Svetlana said quickly.\n I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. Olga took the phone.\n \u0027Anton. I want you to know that everything\u0027s already been decided. And it\u0027s all going to happen very soon.\u0027\n \u0027Tonight,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027How do you know that?\u0027\n \u0027I can just feel it. That was why the Watch was sent out of town, wasn\u0027t it? And why Svetlana was put into the right mood.\u0027\n \u0027What do you know?\u0027\n \u0027The Book of Destiny. Chalk. I understand everything now.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s bad,\u0027 Olga said curtly. \u0027Anton, you have to—\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t have to do anything for anyone. Except for the Light inside me.\u0027\n I ended the call and switched off the phone. I\u0027d had enough. Gesar could easily contact me without any technical devices. Olga would only carry on trying to change my mind. And Svetlana wouldn\u0027t understand what I was doing and why in any case.\n I decided to see things through just as I was, all on my own.\n \u0027Sit down, Anton,\u0027 said Gesar.\n The bar turned out to be tiny. Six or seven tables separated by partitions, plus the bar itself. A television with the sound switched off, showing free-fall jumps. A photograph of the same thing on the wall – bodies in bright-coloured overalls spreadeagled in flight. The air was filled with smoke. There weren\u0027t many people in there, maybe because of the time: it was too late for lunch and there was still a long time to go before the evening rush. I glanced round the tables and saw Gesar sitting at the one in the corner.\n The boss was not alone. There was a bowl of fruit on the table in front of him, and he was lazily plucking grapes off a bunch. A swarthy-skinned young man was sitting a short distance away from him, with his arms crossed. Our eyes met and I felt a slight but distinct pressure.\n He was an Other too.\n We looked at each other for about five seconds, gradually building up the pressure. He had powers, substantial powers, but he didn\u0027t have much experience. As soon as I got the chance, I relaxed my resistance, dodged the young man\u0027s probe and scanned him before he had time to raise his defences.\n Other. Light. Grade four.\n The young man grimaced as if he was in pain. He looked at Gesar with the eyes of a beaten dog.\n \u0027Let me introduce you,\u0027 said Gesar. \u0027Anton Gorodetsky, Other, member of the Moscow Night Watch. Alisher Ganiev, Other, new member of the Moscow Night Watch.\u0027\n The courier.\n I held out my hand and lowered my defences.\n \u0027A Light One, grade two,\u0027 said Alisher, looking into my eyes. He bowed.\n I shook my head and answered:\n \u0027Grade three.\u0027\n The young man glanced at Gesar again. This time he looked surprised, rather than guilty.\n \u0027Grade two,\u0027 the boss confirmed. \u0027You\u0027re at the top of your form, Anton. I\u0027m delighted for you. Sit down and we\u0027ll talk. Alisher, you observe.\u0027\n I took a seat opposite the boss.\n \u0027Do you know why I decided to meet here?\u0027 asked Gesar. \u0027Try the grapes, they\u0027re very good.\u0027\n \u0027How should I know? Maybe they have the best grapes in Moscow?\u0027\n Gesar laughed.\n \u0027Bravo. However, that\u0027s not the important thing. We bought the fruit at the market.\u0027\n \u0027The pleasant surroundings, then.\u0027\n \u0027Nothing of the kind. Just one small room, and if you go through that door, there are two more tables and a pool table.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a secret parachutist.\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t jumped for twenty years now,\u0027 Gesar countered smoothly. \u0027Anton, my dear boy, I came in here for a bite of potato and beef Stroganoff simply in order to show you a micro-environment. A tiny little society. Just sit there for a while and relax. Alisher, a glass of beer for Anton! Take a look around, soldier. Look at the faces. Listen. Breathe in the air.\u0027\n I turned away from the boss and moved to the end of the wooden bench, so that I could at least see the other people there. Alisher was already standing at the bar, waiting for my beer.\n The regulars in the Para Bar had strange faces. All alike in some odd, indefinable way. Distinctive eyes, distinctive gestures. Nothing really special, just the same stamp on every one.\n \u0027A team,\u0027 said the boss. \u0027And a microenvironment. We could have had this conversation in Chance, the gay club, or in the restaurant of the Central Writers\u0027 House, or in a snack bar next to some factory. It doesn\u0027t matter. What does matter was that there had to be a small, close-knit team. More or less isolated from general society. It couldn\u0027t have been McDonald\u0027s or a luxury restaurant, it had to be an official or unofficial club. And you know why? Because this is us. It\u0027s a model of our Watch.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t answer. I watched a young guy on crutches hobble up to the next table, wave away an invitation to sit down, lean on the partition and start talking. The music drowned out his words, but I could absorb the general meaning through the Twilight. A parachute that didn\u0027t open and had to be dumped. A landing with the reserve chute. A broken leg. And now six damn months without jumping!\n \u0027The public here has a very specific profile,\u0027 the boss continued calmly. \u0027Risk. Intense thrills. Little understanding of other people. Their own slang. Problems normal people couldn\u0027t possibly understand. And also, incidentally, regular injuries and death. Do you like it here?\u0027\n I thought for a moment and said:\n \u0027No, you have to be one of the in-crowd. There\u0027s no other way you can be here.\u0027\n \u0027Of course. It\u0027s interesting to drop into any microenvironment like this – once. After that you either accept its laws and join its little society, or you\u0027re rejected. Well, we\u0027re no different. In essential terms, that is. Every Other who has been found and has accepted his own nature is faced with a choice. He either joins the Watch on his side, becomes a soldier, a warrior, who inevitably risks his life. Or he carries on living an almost human life, without developing his special magical powers, making use of some of the advantages of an Other, but suffering all the disadvantages of living like that. The most painful situation is when the initial choice is wrong. When for some reason the Other doesn\u0027t wish to accept the laws of the Watch. But it\u0027s almost impossible to leave our organisation. Tell me, Anton, could you live outside the Watch?\u0027\n Of course, the boss never makes abstract conversation.\n \u0027Probably not,\u0027 I admitted. \u0027It would be hard, almost impossible, in fact, for me to keep within the limits of what an ordinary Light Magician is allowed to do.\u0027\n \u0027And without joining the Watch, you wouldn\u0027t be able to justify your magical actions by the interests of the struggle against the Dark. Right?\u0027\n \u0027Right.\u0027\n \u0027And that\u0027s where the difficulty lies, Antosha, that\u0027s the whole problem.\u0027 The boss sighed. \u0027Alisher, don\u0027t just stand there.\u0027\n He was really giving the young man a hard time. But it wasn\u0027t difficult to guess why: the courier had wormed his way into the Moscow Watch, and now he had to take the inevitable consequences.\n \u0027Your beer, Light One Anton.\u0027 The new Watch member put the glass in front of me with a brief nod.\n I accepted the beer without saying anything. This young, talented magician wasn\u0027t to blame for anything. I was sure we could be friends. But just then I was feeling angry with him: the delivery Alisher had brought to Moscow would separate me from Svetlana for ever.\n \u0027Anton, what are we going to do?\u0027 the boss asked.\n \u0027Just what, exactly, is the problem?\u0027 I answered, looking at him with the eyes of a devoted St Bernard.\n \u0027Svetlana. You\u0027re opposing her mission.\u0027\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\n \u0027Anton. There are basic principles involved here. Axioms. You have no right to object to the policy of the Watch on the basis of your own personal interests.\u0027\n \u0027What have my own personal interests got to do with it?\u0027 I asked, genuinely surprised. \u0027I regard the entire operation that\u0027s being planned as immoral. It won\u0027t be of any benefit to ordinary humans. Like it or not, every attempt to bring about a fundamental change in human society has been a failure.\u0027\n \u0027Sooner or later we shall succeed. Note that I don\u0027t even claim that this attempt will bring success. But the chances are better now than ever before.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027\n \u0027You can lodge an appeal at the highest level.\u0027\n \u0027Will they have time to consider it before Svetlana picks up the chalk and opens the Book of Destiny?\u0027\n The boss closed his eyes and sighed.\n \u0027No, they won\u0027t. It\u0027s all happening tonight, just as soon as our time begins. Are you happy now you know when it\u0027s all going to happen?\u0027\n \u0027Boris Ignatievich,\u0027 I said, deliberately using the name by which I\u0027d first known him. \u0027Listen to me, please. You once left your homeland and came to Russia. Not to serve the interests of the Light, not for the sake of your career. But because of Olga. I don\u0027t know very much about your past history, how much hate and love, how much betrayal and nobility there is in it. But you have to understand me. Because you can.\u0027\n I don\u0027t know what kind of answer I\u0027d been expecting. Maybe I thought he\u0027d look away, or promise to cancel the project.\n \u0027I understand you very well, Anton,\u0027 the boss said with a nod. \u0027In fact, you can\u0027t even imagine how well. That\u0027s exactly why the plan will go ahead.\u0027\n \u0027But why?\u0027\n \u0027Because, my boy, there\u0027s such a thing as destiny. And there\u0027s nothing stronger than destiny. Some are destined to change the world. Some don\u0027t have that in their destiny. Some are destined to bring entire states to their knees, and some to stand in the wings holding the puppets\u0027 strings. Anton, I know what I\u0027m doing. Believe me.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027\n I got up, leaving my untouched beer with its wilting cap of foam. Alisher gave the boss an enquiring look, as if he was prepared to stop me.\n \u0027You have the right to do whatever you want,\u0027 said the boss. \u0027The Light is in you, but the Twilight is always waiting behind you. You know where any false step will lead. And you know that I am willing to help you, I am obliged to help you.\u0027\n \u0027Gesar, my mentor, thank you for everything that you have taught me,\u0027 I said with a bow, and the parachutists cast curious glances in my direction. \u0027I believe I no longer have the right to expect your help. Please accept my gratitude.\u0027\n \u0027You are free of all obligations to me,\u0027 Gesar replied calmly. \u0027Act as your destiny requires of you.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-65.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
