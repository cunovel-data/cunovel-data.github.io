{"id":101333,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"When Egor passed me my tea, I tipped five heaped spoons of sugar into the mug and winked at him.\n \u0027Pour me a glass of tea with two spoons of sugar ... I want to try it before I die.\u0027\n He obviously didn\u0027t know that old joke.\n \u0027And how many should I take?\u0027 he asked.\n \u0027How much do you weigh?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t remember.\u0027\n I estimated his weight by eye.\n \u0027Put four in. To prevent hypoglycaemia.\u0027\n Gulping down his tea, he said:\n \u0027Explain!\u0027\n This wasn\u0027t anything like the way I\u0027d planned. Follow the boy when the Call reaches him. Kill or capture the vampire. And take the grateful boy to the boss – he\u0027d be able to explain everything properly.\n \u0027Once upon a time . . .\u0027 I said. \u0027Like the beginning of a fairy tale, that, isn\u0027t it? Only this isn\u0027t a fairy tale.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m listening.\u0027\n \u0027Okay. I\u0027ll start with something else. There is a human world.\u0027 I nodded towards the window, the little courtyard outside and the cars crawling along the road. \u0027There it is. All around us. And most people can\u0027t move beyond it. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s always been. But sometimes we turn up. The Others.\u0027\n \u0027And vampires?\u0027\n \u0027Vampires are Others too. They\u0027re a different kind of Other, though, their powers are determined in advance.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Egor, shaking his head.\n Okay, so I\u0027m no tutor. I\u0027m no good at expounding the basic truths, I don\u0027t enjoy it . . .\n \u0027Imagine two shamans who have gorged themselves on narcotic mushrooms, beating on their tambourines,\u0027 I said. \u0027A long, long time ago, back in prehistoric times. One of the shamans is putting one over on the hunters and the chief. The other one suddenly sees his shadow, which was trembling on the floor of the cave, gain volume and rise up until it stands erect. He takes a step forward and enters the shadow. He enters the Twilight. And that\u0027s when the most interesting part begins. You understand?\u0027\n Egor didn\u0027t say anything.\n \u0027The Twilight changes the person who has entered it. It\u0027s a different world, and it makes people into Others. But who you become depends entirely on you. The Twilight is a raging river flowing in all directions at once. Decide who you want to be in the Twilight world. But make up your mind quickly, you don\u0027t have much time.\u0027\n Now the boy understood. His pupils contracted and his skin turned slightly paler. An excellent stress response, he really would make a good operational agent. . .\n \u0027Who can I become?\u0027\n \u0027You? Anybody you like. Your choice still hasn\u0027t been made. And you know what the basic choice is? Good or Evil. Light or Dark.\u0027\n \u0027And are you Good?\u0027\n \u0027First and foremost I\u0027m an Other. The difference between Good and Evil lies in your attitude towards ordinary people. If you choose the Light, you won\u0027t use your powers for personal gain. If you choose the Dark, that will be what you do most of the time. But even a black magician is capable of healing people and finding people who have been lost. And a white magician can refuse to help people.\u0027\n \u0027Then I don\u0027t see what the difference is.\u0027\n \u0027You will. You\u0027ll understand when you choose one side or the other.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll never choose!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s too late, Egor. You\u0027ve already been in the Twilight, and you\u0027re already changing. In a couple of days the choice will have been made.\u0027\n \u0027If you choose the Light . . .\u0027 Egor got up and poured himself some more tea. I noticed it was the first time he hadn\u0027t been afraid to turn his back on me. \u0027Then who are you? A magician?\u0027\n \u0027A magician\u0027s apprentice. I work in the office of the Night Watch. Someone has to.\u0027\n \u0027And what can you do? Show me, I want to see.\u0027\n There it was, straight out of the textbook. He\u0027d been in the Twilight, but that hadn\u0027t convinced him. Petty fairground tricks are far more impressive.\n \u0027Watch.\u0027\n I held my arm out towards him. Egor froze, trying to understand what was going on. Then he looked at his cup.\n The steam had stopped rising from his tea. The tea was crackling as it turned into a cylinder of muddy brown ice with tea leaves frozen into it.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said the boy.\n Thermodynamics is the simple part of manipulating matter. I allowed the Brownian motion to start up again, and the ice boiled. Egor shrieked and dropped his cup.\n \u0027Sorry!\u0027 I jumped up and grabbed the cloth from the sink, then squatted down to wipe up the puddle on the lino.\n \u0027Magic\u0027s nothing but trouble,\u0027 said the boy. \u0027That was a good cup.\u0027\n \u0027Just a moment.\u0027\n My shadow raced towards me, I entered the Twilight and looked at the broken pieces. They still remembered the whole, and it hadn\u0027t been the cup\u0027s destiny to get broken so soon. I raked the shards together with my hand. A few of the smallest pieces that had fallen under the cooker eagerly moved a bit closer.\n I emerged from the Twilight and put the white cup on the table.\n \u0027Now you only need to pour more tea into it.\u0027\n \u0027Fantastic\u0027 Apparently this little trick had made a big impression on Egor. \u0027And can you do that with any kind of thing?\u0027\n \u0027Almost any kind.\u0027\n \u0027Anton . . . what if something was broken a week ago?\u0027\n I couldn\u0027t help smiling.\n \u0027No, sorry, then it\u0027s too late. The Twilight gives you a chance, but you have to take it quickly, very quickly.\u0027\n Egor\u0027s face darkened. I wondered what it was he\u0027d broken a week ago.\n \u0027Now do you believe me?\u0027\n \u0027Is that magic?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. The most primitive kind. It takes almost no effort to learn.\u0027\n I probably shouldn\u0027t have said that. The boy\u0027s eyes lit up. He was already figuring out his prospects. His profit.\n Light and Dark . . .\n \u0027But an experienced magician, he can do other stuff too?\u0027\n \u0027Even I can.\u0027\n \u0027And control people?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \u0027Yes, we can do that.\u0027\n \u0027And do you? How come terrorists take hostages? You could creep up in the Twilight without being seen and shoot them. Or make them shoot themselves! How come people die of diseases? Magicians can cure them, you said so yourself.\u0027\n \u0027That would be Good,\u0027 I said.\n \u0027Of course! But you\u0027re the magicians of the Light!\u0027\n \u0027If we do any deed that is unconditionally good, it gives the Dark Magicians the right to do an evil deed.\u0027\n Egor looked at me in amazement. Too much had happened over the last twenty-four hours for him to take it all in. But he was handling it pretty well.\n \u0027Unfortunately, Egor, Evil is stronger by its very nature. Evil is destructive. It\u0027s much easier for Evil to destroy than it is for Good to create.\u0027\n \u0027Then what do you do? This Night Watch of yours. . . Do you fight against the Dark Magicians?\u0027\n I mustn\u0027t answer. I knew that with a devastating clarity, just as I knew I should never have confided in the boy. I should have put him to sleep and withdrawn deeper into the Twilight. But not tried to explain anything to him, not a single thing.\n I wouldn\u0027t be able to prove anything to him.\n \u0027Do you fight against them?\u0027\n \u0027Not exactly,\u0027 I said. The truth was worse than a lie, but I had no right to tell a lie. \u0027We keep an eye on each other.\u0027\n \u0027Getting ready to fight?\u0027\n I looked at Egor, thinking what a bright kid he was. But still a kid. And if I told him now that the great battle between Good and Evil was approaching, that he could be one of the new Jedi of the Twilight world, then he\u0027d be ours.\n Only not for long.\n \u0027No, Egor. There aren\u0027t very many of us.\u0027\n \u0027The Light Others? You mean there are more Dark Ones?\u0027\n Now he was all set to leave home, abandon Mum and Dad, put on his shining armour and set out to die for the cause of Good . . .\n \u0027There aren\u0027t many Others in general. Egor, the battle between Good and Evil has been going on for thousands of years, with the balance shifting all the time. Sometimes Good has won, but if you only knew how many people, who had no idea the Twilight world even existed, were killed in the process. There aren\u0027t many Others, but every one of them can get thousands of ordinary people to follow him. Egor, if the battle between Good and Evil breaks out, half the people in the world will be killed. That\u0027s why almost fifty years ago a treaty was signed. The Great Treaty between Good and Evil, Dark and Light.\u0027\n His eyes now opened really wide.\n I sighed and went on:\n \u0027It\u0027s a short treaty. I\u0027ll read it out to you – in the official Russian translation. You already have a right to know.\u0027\n I closed my eyes and peered into the darkness. The Twilight swirled into life behind my eyelids. A grey banner unfurled, covered with blazing red letters. The Treaty must not be recited from memory, it may only be read:\n We are the Others,\n We serve different forces,\n But in the Twilight there is no difference between\n the absence of Dark and the absence of Light.\n Our struggle is capable of destroying the world.\n We have concluded a Great Treaty, a truce.\n Each side shall live according to its own laws,\n Each side shall have its own rights.\n We delimit our own rights and our own laws.\n We are the Others.\n We establish the Night Watch,\n So that the forces of Light may monitor the forces of Dark.\n We are the Others.\n We establish the Day Watch,\n So that the forces of Dark may monitor the forces of Light\n Time will decide for us.\n The boy\u0027s eyes grew even bigger and rounder. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-15.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
