{"id":101380,"no":63,"title":"Page 63","content":"Even riding at a hundred kilometres an hour the air still felt hot. The wind struck at my cheeks like a rough towel. It felt like we were riding through a furnace, an endless tarmac furnace full of vehicles that had already been roasted in the sun, slowly crawling along. At least three times I was sure we were going to crash into a car or an inconveniently placed pillar.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t likely that we\u0027d be killed outright. The rest of the team would sense what had happened and come and put us back together, piece by piece, but it wouldn\u0027t exactly be fun.\\n\\n We arrived without any mishaps. After the ring road Semyon used his magic about five times, but only to make highway patrolmen look the other way.\\n\\n Semyon didn\u0027t ask my address, even though he\u0027d never been to my place. He stopped outside the entrance to the building and switched off the engine. The teenagers swilling cheap beer in the kids\u0027 playground stopped talking and stared at the bike. How great it must be to have such clear and simple dreams: beer, E at the nightclub, a hot girlfriend and a Harley.\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been having premonitions?\u0027 Semyon asked.\\n\\n I started. I hadn\u0027t really told anyone that I\u0027d been having them.\\n\\n \u0027Quite a long time now.\u0027\\n\\n Semyon nodded. He looked up at my windows. He didn\u0027t tell me why he\u0027d asked the question.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe I ought to go up with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen, I\u0027m not a girl who needs to be seen all the way home to her door.\u0027\\n\\n The magician smiled.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, don\u0027t get me mixed up with Ignat. Okay, it\u0027s not such a big deal. Be careful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of everything, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n The bike\u0027s engine howled. The magician shook his head.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s something coming, Anton. Coming this way. Be careful.\u0027\\n\\n He zoomed off to roars of approval from the adolescents, and slipped neatly through the gap between a parked Volga and a slow-moving Zhiguli. I watched him go and shook my head. I didn\u0027t need any premonitions to know that Semyon would spend the whole day zooming round Moscow. Then he\u0027d attach himself to some group of rockers and a quarter of an hour later he\u0027d be a fully fledged member, already creating legends about a crazy old biker.\\n\\n Be careful. . .\\n\\n Of what?\\n\\n And more importantly, what for?\\n\\n I tapped the code into the keypad, walked into the lobby and called the lift. That morning I\u0027d been on holiday with my friends, and everything had been fine.\\n\\n Nothing had changed now, except that I wasn\u0027t there any longer.\\n\\n They say that when Light Magicians go off the rails, the first sign is always flashes of insight, like the ones epileptics have before a fit. Then the pointless use of power, like killing flies with fireballs and chopping firewood with combat spells. Quarrels with the people they love. Sudden disagreements with some friends and equally unexpected warm relations with others. Everyone knows that, and everyone knows what happens after a Light Magician goes off the rails.\\n\\n Be careful . . .\\n\\n I walked up to the door and reached for my keys.\\n\\n But the door was already unlocked.\\n\\n My parents had a set of keys. But they would never have come all the way from Saratov without giving me any warning. And I would have sensed that they were coming.\\n\\n No ordinary human thief would ever break into my apartment, the simple sign on the threshold would have stopped him. And there were barriers against Others too. Of course, they could be overcome with sufficient power. But the sentry systems ought to have been triggered.\\n\\n I stood there, looking at the narrow crack between the door and the doorpost, the crack that shouldn\u0027t have been there. I looked through the Twilight, but I didn\u0027t see anything.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have a weapon with me. My pistol was inside the apartment. So were the ten combat amulets.\\n\\n I could have followed instructions. A member of the Night Watch who discovers that a home secured by magical means has been penetrated by strangers must first inform the duty operations officer and his supervisor, and then . . .\\n\\n But the moment I imagined appealing to Gesar, after he\u0027d casually scattered the entire Day Watch only two days earlier, I lost any desire to follow instructions. I folded my fingers into the sign for a rapid freeze spell, probably because I remembered how well it had worked for Semyon.\\n\\n Be careful?\\n\\n I pushed open the door and walked into the apartment that had suddenly stopped being mine.\\n\\n And as I walked in, I realised who had enough power, authority and sheer chutzpah to come calling without an invitation.\\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon, boss!\u0027 I said, glancing into the study.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t entirely wrong.\\n\\n Zabulon was sitting in a chair by the window, reading a newspaper. He raised his eyebrows in surprise and put down the paper. Then he carefully took off his spectacles with the slim gold frames.\\n\\n \u0027Good afternoon, Anton. You know, I\u0027d be very glad to be your boss.\u0027\\n\\n He smiled. A Dark Magician beyond classification, the chief of the Moscow Day Watch. As usual, he was wearing an immaculately tailored black suit and a light grey shirt. An Other of indeterminate age, with a lean frame and close-cropped hair.\\n\\n \u0027My mistake,\u0027 I said. \u0027What are you doing here?\u0027\\n\\n Zabulon shrugged:\\n\\n \u0027Take your amulet. It\u0027s in the desk somewhere, I can sense it.\u0027\\n\\n I walked over to the desk, opened the drawer and took out the ivory medallion on a copper chain. I squeezed the amulet in my fist and felt it grow warm.\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon, you no longer have any power over me.\u0027\\n\\n The Dark Magician nodded:\\n\\n \u0027Good. I don\u0027t want you to have any doubts about your own safety.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you doing in a Light One\u0027s home, Zabulon? I would be within my rights to report you to the tribunal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Zabulon said with a shrug. \u0027I know all that. I\u0027m in the wrong. This is stupid. I\u0027m exposing myself to reprisals and exposing the Day Watch too. But I haven\u0027t come to you as an enemy.\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \u0027And you don\u0027t need to worry about any observation devices,\u0027 he added casually. \u0027Either your own, or the ones that the Inquisition installs. I took the liberty of, shall we say, putting them to sleep. Everything we say to each other will remain just between the two of us, for ever.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Believe half of what a human says, a quarter of what a Light One says, and not a word of what a Dark One says,\u0027 I muttered.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, you have every right not to trust me. It\u0027s your duty not to. But please hear me out.\u0027 Zabulon suddenly smiled in a remarkably open and reassuring way. \u0027You\u0027re a Light One. You are obliged to assist everyone who asks for help, even me. And now I\u0027m asking.\u0027\\n\\n I hesitated, then went across to the sofa and sat down. Without taking my shoes off, without cancelling the suspended freeze, as if it wasn\u0027t utterly absurd to imagine myself doing combat with Zabulon.\\n\\n There was an outsider in my apartment. So much for \u0027my home is my castle\u0027 – and I\u0027d almost started to believe it during the years I\u0027d been working for the Watch.\\n\\n \u0027First of all, how did you get in?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027First of all, I took a perfectly ordinary lock pick, but—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Zabulon, you know what I mean. The sentry systems can be destroyed, but they can\u0027t be tricked. They should have been triggered by any unauthorised entry.\u0027\\n\\n The Dark Magician sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Kostya helped me to get in. You gave him access.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hoped he was my friend. Even if he is a vampire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is your friend,\u0027 Zabulon said with a smile. \u0027And he wants to help you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In his own way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In our own way, Anton. I\u0027ve entered your home, but I have no intention of causing any harm. I haven\u0027t looked at any of the official documents you keep here. I haven\u0027t left any monitoring signs. I came to talk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then talk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You and I have a problem, Anton. The same one. And today it reached critical proportions.\u0027\\n\\n The moment I saw Zabulon, I\u0027d known what we\u0027d be talking about, so I just nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Good, you understand.\u0027 The Dark Magician leaned forward in his chair and sighed. \u0027Anton, I\u0027m not under any illusions here. We see the world differently. And we understand our duty in different ways. But even under those conditions our interests sometimes coincide. From your point of view, we Dark Ones have our failings. Sometimes our actions seem rather ambiguous. And we are obliged by our very nature to be rather less caring with people. That\u0027s all true. But note that nobody has ever accused us of attempting to change the entire destiny of humanity. Since the Treaty was concluded we have simply lived our own lives and we\u0027d like you to do the same.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nobody has ever accused you,\u0027 I agreed, \u0027because whichever way you look at it, time is on your side.\u0027\\n\\n Zabulon nodded:\\n\\n \u0027And what does that mean? Perhaps we\u0027re more like human beings? Perhaps we\u0027re right? But let\u0027s not get into those arguments, there\u0027s no end to them. I repeat what I have said before. We honour the Treaty. And we often observe it far more closely than the forces of the Light.\u0027\\n\\n A standard tactic in an argument. First admit to some kind of generalised guilt. Then gently reproach your opponent for being equally guilty of the same general kind of fault. Reproach them a bit and then drop it. Let\u0027s just forget the whole thing!\\n\\n And then move on to what\u0027s really important.\\n\\n \u0027But, let\u0027s deal with what\u0027s really important here,\u0027 said Zabulon, getting serious. \u0027There\u0027s no point in beating about the bush. In the last hundred years the forces of the Light have launched three global experiments. The revolution in Russia. The Second World War. And now this new project. Following the same scenario.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 I said. I suddenly had this desperate aching feeling in my chest.\\n\\n \u0027Really? Let me explain. Social models are developed that should eventually – at the cost of massive upheaval and immense bloodshed – bring humanity to the ideal society. Ideal, that is, from your point of view, but I won\u0027t argue about that. Certainly not. Everyone has a right to his own dream. But your path is so very cruel . . .\u0027 Another sad smile. \u0027You accuse us of cruelty, and not entirely without reason, but what\u0027s one child killed in a black mass compared with any fascist children\u0027s concentration camp? And fascism was another of your inventions. Another one that got out of control. First there was internationalism and communism – that didn\u0027t work. Then there was national socialism. Another mistake? You put your heads together and examined the result. Then you sighed, wiped the slates clean and started experimenting all over again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They turned out to be mistakes thanks to your efforts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course! We do have an instinct for self-preservation, you know. We don\u0027t construct social models on the basis of our ethics. So why should we tolerate your projects?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n Zabulon nodded, apparently satisfied.\\n\\n \u0027So you see, Anton. Maybe we\u0027re enemies. We are enemies. Last winter you caused us some inconvenience, serious inconvenience. This spring you frustrated me again. You eliminated two Day Watch agents. Yes, of course, the Inquisition declared that your actions were committed in self-defence and out of absolute necessity but, believe me, I was not pleased. What kind of leader is it who can\u0027t even protect his own colleagues? So, we are enemies. But now we have a unique situation. Yet another experiment. And you\u0027re indirectly involved in it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-63.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) \\n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
