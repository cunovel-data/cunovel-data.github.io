{"id":101351,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"It\u0027s rare for anyone to have a serious breakdown. It\u0027s only training, after all, not a test. And the height set for every individual is no higher than he can jump – provided he calls on every last ounce of his strength, leaving scraps of blood-stained skin behind on the razor wire along the top of the barrier. But when the people on the course matter to you, or even if you simply like them, it starts getting to you, tearing you apart. You catch a strange glance cast in your direction and start wondering what your friend has just learned on the course. What truths? What lies? And what the student is learning about himself, about the world around him, his parents and friends . . . And you have a dreadful, unbearable yearning to help. To explain, to hint, to prompt. But no one who\u0027s been through the course will ever give way to that desire. Because that\u0027s what they\u0027re learning through their own pain and suffering – what to say and when. Generally speaking, we can and should say everything. We just have to choose the right time, otherwise the truth can be worse than a lie. \u0027Olya?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll understand soon,\u0027 I said. \u0027Just wait a while.\u0027 I glanced through the Twilight and hurled the car forward, flitting neatly between a clumsy jeep and a military truck. The mirror cracked as it folded back after clipping the edge of the truck – I didn\u0027t care. Our car was first across the intersection, tearing out on to the Highway of Enthusiasts. \u0027Is he in love with me?\u0027 Svetlana suddenly asked. \u0027Is he, yes or no? You must know, don\u0027t you?\u0027 I shuddered and the car swerved, but Svetlana took no notice. I sensed it wasn\u0027t the first time she\u0027d asked that question. She and Olga must have left a difficult conversation unfinished. \u0027Or is he in love with you?\u0027 That was it. I couldn\u0027t keep quiet any longer. \u0027Anton is very fond of Olga,\u0027 I said, speaking both of myself and the owner of my body in the third person. It was rather artificial, but it gave an impression of cool, distant politeness. \u0027Comrades-inarms. Nothing more than that.\u0027 If Svetlana asked Olga how she felt about me, it would be harder to avoid lying. She didn\u0027t. And a moment later she touched my hand, as if she was asking me to forgive her. But now I couldn\u0027t stop myself: \u0027Why do you ask?\u0027 She answered simply, without hesitation: \u0027I don\u0027t understand. Anton is behaving very strangely. Sometimes he seems to be madly in love with me. And sometimes it\u0027s as if I\u0027m just one of hundreds of Others that he knows.\u0027 \u0027A destiny node,\u0027 I said briefly. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027You haven\u0027t studied that yet, Sveta.\u0027 \u0027Explain it to me, then!\u0027 \u0027You know,\u0027 I said, accelerating rapidly – that must have been the body\u0027s motor reflexes kicking in – \u0027you know, when he came to your place that first time—\u0027 \u0027I know that I was influenced. He told me,\u0027 Svetlana interrupted. \u0027That\u0027s not the point. The suggestion was removed when you were told the truth. But when you learn to see destiny – and you\u0027ll learn to see it a lot more clearly than I do – then you\u0027ll understand.\u0027 \u0027They told us that destiny is variable.\u0027 \u0027Destiny is polyvariable. But when he came to see you, Anton knew that if he succeeded in his assignment, he would fall in love with you.\u0027 Svetlana didn\u0027t answer that. I thought I saw her cheeks colour slightly, but maybe that was just the wind in the open car. \u0027And what difference does that make?\u0027 \u0027Do you know what it\u0027s like to be condemned to love?\u0027 \u0027But isn\u0027t it always like that?\u0027 Svetlana asked, trembling with indignation. \u0027When people love each other, when they find each other out of thousands and millions of people. It\u0027s always destiny!\u0027 Once again I sensed that infinitely naïve girl in her, the girl who couldn\u0027t hate anything except herself. The girl who was already beginning to disappear. \u0027No, Sveta, haven\u0027t you ever heard love compared to a flower?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027A flower can be grown, Sveta. But it can be bought too, or given as a gift.\u0027 \u0027Did Anton buy it?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 I said, rather too sharply. \u0027It was a gift. From destiny.\u0027 \u0027What difference does that make? If it is love?\u0027 \u0027Sveta, cut flowers are beautiful, but they don\u0027t live for long. They\u0027re already dying, even when they\u0027re carefully placed in a vase and given fresh water.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s afraid of loving me,\u0027 Svetlana said thoughtfully. \u0027Isn\u0027t he? I wasn\u0027t afraid, because I didn\u0027t know all this.\u0027 I drove up to the building, weaving between the parked cars, mostly Zhigulis and Moskviches. This wasn\u0027t a smart district. \u0027Why did I tell you all that?\u0027 asked Svetlana. \u0027Why did I make you answer? Just because you\u0027re four hundred and forty-three years old?\u0027 I shuddered. Yes, a real wealth of experience. An immense wealth. Next year Olga would be celebrating a very special kind of birthday. I\u0027d like to believe my body would still be in such condition, even at a quarter of that age. I left the car without putting on the alarm. No human would ever think of trying to steal it in any case: the protective spells provide greater security than any alarm system. Svetlana and I walked briskly up the steps without speaking and went into her apartment. Things had changed a bit, of course. Svetlana had left her job, but her study grant and the initial allowance paid to every Other when they were initiated came to far more than her modest earnings as a doctor. She had a new TV, but I couldn\u0027t imagine when she found the time to watch it. It was a flashy widescreen model, too big for her apartment. I found this sudden yen for the good life amusing. It\u0027s something everyone goes through at the beginning – probably a defensive reaction. When your world crumbles around you, when the old fears and anxieties disappear and new ones, still vague and unfamiliar, take their place, everyone starts acting out some of the dreams from their former life that seemed so unreal only recently. Some go out to expensive restaurants, others buy flashy cars or haute couture clothes. It doesn\u0027t last for long, and not just because working in the Watch won\u0027t make you a millionaire. The very needs that seemed so compelling only yesterday begin to fade, disappearing into the past. For ever. \u0027Olga?\u0027 Svetlana looked into my eyes. I sighed, gathering my strength. \u0027I couldn\u0027t tell you earlier. We can only talk here. Your apartment is protected against observation by the Dark Ones.\u0027 I could see that Svetlana already suspected the truth. \u0027This is only Olga\u0027s body,\u0027 I said. \u0027Anton?\u0027 I nodded. The two of us must have looked absurd. It was a good thing Svetlana was already used to absurdity. She believed me straight away. \u0027You bastard!\u0027 Spoken in a tone that would have suited the aristocratic Olga. And the slap to my face came from the same opera libretto. It didn\u0027t hurt, but it upset me. \u0027What\u0027s that for?\u0027 I asked. \u0027For eavesdropping on other people\u0027s conversations!\u0027 Svetlana snapped. It wasn\u0027t an entirely accurate way of putting it, but I got the idea. When Svetlana raised her other hand, I ignored the Christian teaching and dodged the second slap. \u0027Sveta, I promised to take care of this body!\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t!\u0027 Svetlana breathed heavily, biting her Up. Her eyes were blazing. I\u0027d never seen her in such a fury, never even suspected she had it in her. Just what was it that had made her so furious? \u0027So, you\u0027re afraid to love cut flowers?\u0027 said Svetlana, advancing on me. \u0027That\u0027s your problem, is it?\u0027 I got the idea. But it took a moment or two. \u0027Get out of here! Get out!\u0027 I backed away until I bumped into the door. But the moment I stopped, Svetlana stopped too. She jerked her head to one side and yelled: \u0027Stay in that body! It suits you better, you\u0027re not a man, you\u0027re a spineless wimp!\u0027 I didn\u0027t answer. I didn\u0027t say a word, because I could already see how it would go. I could see the probabilities stretching out ahead of us, destiny derisively weaving its pathways together. And when Svetlana burst into tears, suddenly robbed of all her fighting spirit, and lowered her face into her hands, when I put my arm round her and she sobbed in relief on my shoulder, I felt cold and empty inside. The cold was piercing, as if I was again standing on a snow-covered roof in a blustery winter wind. Svetlana was still human. There wasn\u0027t enough of the Other in her yet, she didn\u0027t understand, she couldn\u0027t see the road leading off into the distance, the road we were destined to follow. And so she couldn\u0027t see how that road divided in two, running in different directions. Love is happiness, but only when you believe it will last for ever. Even though every time it turns out to be a He, it\u0027s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy. Great knowledge brings great sorrow. How I wished I didn\u0027t know the inevitable future. I wished I didn\u0027t know it, and that I could love her without thinking twice, like an ordinary, mortal human being. And what a pity that I wasn\u0027t in my own body. To any outsider it might have looked like two women who were close friends had decided to spend a quiet evening in front of the TV taking tea with jam and chatting. \u0027You really like bread rolls, don\u0027t you?\u0027 Svetlana asked in surprise. \u0027Yes. With butter and jam,\u0027 I replied. \u0027I thought someone promised to take care of that body. . .\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not doing it any harm! Believe me, it\u0027s having a really great time.\u0027 \u0027Well,\u0027 Svetlana replied. \u0027You ask Olga afterwards how she takes care of her figure.\u0027 I hesitated, but went ahead and cut another roll in half, then spread it generously with jam. \u0027And whose great idea was it to hide you in a woman\u0027s body?\u0027 \u0027The boss\u0027s, I think.\u0027 \u0027I thought it must be.\u0027 \u0027Olga supported him.\u0027 \u0027I should think so. She worships the ground Boris Ignatievich walks on.\u0027 I had my doubts about that, but I kept quiet. Svetlana got up and went over to the wardrobe, opened it and looked thoughtfully at the hangers. \u0027Why don\u0027t you put on a robe?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 I said, choking on my roll. \u0027Are you going to sit around in the house like that? Those jeans are bursting on you. It must be uncomfortable.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t you find something like a tracksuit?\u0027 I asked pitifully. Svetlana gave me a mocking glance and then relented.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-34.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
