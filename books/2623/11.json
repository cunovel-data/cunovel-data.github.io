{"id":101329,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"That was enough information to search the computer database. I didn\u0027t have access to the complete files, I wasn\u0027t senior enough. But fortunately senior management had no idea how much information an indirect search could yield.\n Provided, of course, that I really wanted to find out who Olga was.\n I poured the cognac and waited. Olga came out of the bathroom about five minutes later, drying her hair with a towel. She was wearing my jeans and sweater.\n I couldn\u0027t say she was transformed . . . but she was definitely looking a lot more attractive.\n \u0027Thanks, Anton. You\u0027ve no idea how much I enjoyed—\u0027\n \u0027I can guess.\u0027\n \u0027Guessing\u0027s not enough. That smell, Anton . . . that smell of burning. I\u0027d almost got used to it after half a century.\u0027 She sat down awkwardly on a stool and sighed. \u0027It\u0027s not good, of course, but I\u0027m glad of this crisis. Even if they don\u0027t pardon me, it\u0027s a chance to get clean . . .\u0027\n \u0027You can stay in this form, Olga. I\u0027ll go out and buy some decent clothes.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t bother. I only have half an hour a day.\u0027\n Olga screwed up the towel and tossed it on to the windowsill. She sighed:\n \u0027I might not get another chance to take a shower. Or drink cognac . . . Your health, Anton.\u0027\n \u0027Your health.\u0027\n The cognac was good. I took a sip and savoured it, despite the total muddle in my head. Olga downed hers in one and pulled a face, but she observed politely:\n \u0027Not bad.\u0027\n \u0027Why won\u0027t the boss let you assume your normal form?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s not in his power.\u0027\n Clear enough. So it wasn\u0027t the regional office that had punished her, but the higher authorities.\n \u0027Here\u0027s to your success, Olga. Whatever it was that you did . . . I\u0027m sure your guilt must have been expiated by now.\u0027\n She shrugged.\n \u0027I\u0027d like to think so. I know people find me easy to sympathise with, but the punishment was just. Anyway, let\u0027s get down to business.\u0027\n \u0027Okay.\u0027\n Olga leaned across the table towards me and spoke in a mysterious whisper:\n \u0027I\u0027ll be honest with you: I\u0027ve had enough. I\u0027ve got strong nerves, but this is no way to live. My only chance is to carry through an assignment so important that our superiors will have no option but to pardon me.\u0027\n \u0027Where can you find a mission like that?\u0027\n \u0027We already have it. And it has three stages. The boy – we protect him and then bring him over to the side of the Light. The girl vampire – we destroy her.\u0027\n Olga\u0027s voice sounded so confident that suddenly I believed her. Protect one, destroy the other. No problem.\n \u0027But that\u0027s only the small change, Anton. An operation like that will get you promoted, but it won\u0027t save me. The really important part is the girl with the vortex.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re already dealing with her, Olga. They\u0027ve taken me . . . us off the assignment.\u0027\n \u0027Never mind that. They won\u0027t be able to handle it.\u0027\n \u0027Oh no?\u0027 I asked ironically.\n \u0027They won\u0027t. Boris Ignatievich is a very powerful magician. But this isn\u0027t his field.\u0027 Olga half closed her eyes in a mocking smile. \u0027I\u0027ve been dealing with Inferno eruptions all my life.\u0027\n \u0027So that\u0027s why it\u0027s war!\u0027 I exclaimed, catching on at last.\n \u0027Of course. You don\u0027t get sudden eruptions of hatred like that in times of peace. That bastard Adolf. . . he had plenty of admirers, but he would have been incinerated in the very first year of war. And the whole of Germany with him. The situation with Stalin was different, adoration on a monstrous scale like that is a powerful shield. Anton, I\u0027m a simple Russian woman . . .\u0027 – the smile that flitted across Olga\u0027s face showed what she really felt about the word \u0027simple\u0027 – \u0027and I spent all the last war shielding the enemies of my own country against curses. For that alone I deserve to be pardoned. Do you believe me?\u0027\n \u0027I believe you.\u0027 I got the impression she was already getting slightly drunk.\n \u0027It\u0027s lousy work . . . we all have to go against our human nature, but that was too much . . . Anyway, Anton, they won\u0027t be able to handle it. I can at least try, though even I can\u0027t be sure I\u0027ll succeed.\u0027\n \u0027Olga, if this is all so serious, you should put in a report.\u0027\n She shook her head and pushed back her wet hair.\n \u0027I can\u0027t. I\u0027m forbidden to associate with anyone except my partner on the assignment and Boris Ignatievich. I\u0027ve told him everything. All I can do now is wait. And hope that I\u0027ll be able to deal with this – at the very last moment.\u0027\n \u0027But doesn\u0027t the boss understand all that?\u0027\n \u0027I think he understands it all very well.\u0027\n \u0027So that\u0027s the way . . .\u0027 I whispered.\n \u0027We were lovers. For a very long time. And we were friends too, something you don\u0027t find so often . . . Okay, Anton. Today we solve the problem of the boy and the crazed vampire. Tomorrow we wait. We wait for the Inferno to erupt. Agreed?\u0027\n \u0027I have to think about it, Olga.\u0027\n \u0027Fine. Think. But my time\u0027s up already. Turn away.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t have time. It was probably Olga\u0027s own fault. She\u0027d miscalculated how much time she had left.\n It was a truly repulsive sight. Olga shook and arched over backwards. A shudd er ran through her body and the bones bent as if made of rubber. Her skin split open, revealing bleeding muscles. A moment later, and the woman had been transformed into a formless, crumpled bundle of flesh. And the ball kept shrinking, getting smaller and smaller and sprouting soft, white feathers . . .\n The owl launched itself off the stool with a cry that sounded half human, half bird, and fluttered across to her chosen place on the fridge.\n \u0027Hell and damnation!\u0027 I exclaimed, forgetting all the rules. \u0027Olga!\u0027\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it lovely?\u0027 The woman\u0027s voice was gasping, still distorted by pain.\n \u0027Why? Why like that?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s part of the punishment, Anton.\u0027\n I reached out my hand and touched one outstretched, trembling wing.\n \u0027Okay, Olga, I\u0027m with you.\u0027\n \u0027Then let\u0027s get to work, Anton.\u0027\n I nodded and went out into the hallway. I opened the cupboard where I keep my equipment and moved into the Twilight – otherwise you simply can\u0027t see anything in there except clothes and a load of old junk.\n A light body settled on my shoulder.\n \u0027What have you got?\u0027\n \u0027I discharged the onyx amulet. Can you recharge it?\u0027\n \u0027No, I\u0027ve been deprived of almost all my powers. All they left me is what\u0027s required to neutralise the Inferno. And my memory, Anton . . . they left me my memory. How are you going to kill the girl vampire?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s not registered,\u0027 I said. \u0027I\u0027ve only got the old folk methods.\u0027\n The owl gave a screeching laugh.\n \u0027Are poplar stakes still popular?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t have any.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Because of your friends?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. I don\u0027t want them to shudder every time they step inside the door.\u0027\n \u0027What, then?\u0027\n I took a pistol out of a hollow gouged in the bricks and glanced sideways at the owl – Olga was studying the gun.\n \u0027Silver? Very painful for a vampire, but not fatal.\u0027\n \u0027It has explosive bullets.\u0027 I slid the clip out of the Desert Eagle. \u0027Explosive silver bullets. Four four calibre. Three hits and a vampire\u0027s totally helpless.\u0027\n \u0027And then?\u0027\n \u0027Traditional methods.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t believe in technology,\u0027 Olga said doubtfully. \u0027I\u0027ve seen a werewolf regenerate after being torn to pieces by a shell.\u0027\n \u0027How long did it take to regenerate?\u0027\n \u0027Three days.\u0027\n \u0027Well, there you are then.\u0027\n \u0027All right, Anton. If you have no faith in your own powers . . .\u0027\n She was disappointed, I realised that. But then I was no field operative. I was a staff worker assigned to work in the field.\n \u0027Everything will be fine,\u0027 I reassured her. \u0027Trust me. Let\u0027s just focus on finding the bait.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, let\u0027s go.\u0027\n \u0027This is where it all happened,\u0027 I told Olga. We were standing in the alley. In the Twilight, of course.\n The occasional passers-by looked odd skirting round me, yet unable to see me.\n \u0027This is where you killed the vampire.\u0027 Olga\u0027s tone couldn\u0027t have been more brisk. \u0027Right ... I understand. You did a poor job cleaning up the mess, but that\u0027s not important.\u0027\n As far as I could see, there wasn\u0027t a trace left of the dead vampire. But I didn\u0027t argue.\n \u0027The girl vampire was here . . . you hit her with something here . . . no, you splashed vodka on her . . .\u0027 Olga laughed quietly. \u0027She got away . . . Our operatives have completely lost their touch. The trail\u0027s still clear even now!\u0027\n \u0027She changed,\u0027 I said morosely.\n \u0027Into a bat?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Garik said she did it at the very last moment.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s bad. This vampire\u0027s more powerful than I was hoping.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s completely wild. She\u0027s drunk living blood and killed. She has no experience, but plenty of power.\u0027\n \u0027We will destroy her,\u0027 Olga said sternly.\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \u0027And here\u0027s the boy\u0027s trail.\u0027 There was a note of approval in Olga\u0027s voice. \u0027Yes indeed . . . real potential. Let\u0027s go and see where he lives.\u0027\n We walked out of the alley and set off along the pavement. The houses surrounded a large inner yard on all sides. I could sense the boy\u0027s aura too, but it was very weak and confused: he clearly walked round here all the time.\n \u0027Straight ahead,\u0027 Olga commanded. \u0027Turn left. Further. Turn right. Stop.\u0027\n I stopped facing a street with a trolleybus crawling slowly along it. I didn\u0027t emerge from the Twilight yet.\n \u0027In that building,\u0027 Olga told me. \u0027Straight ahead. That\u0027s where he is.\u0027\n The building was a monster, an immensely high, flat slab set on tall legs or stilts. At first glance it looked like some gigantic monument to the matchbox. Look again and you could see it as an expression of a morbid gigantomania.\n \u0027That\u0027s a good house for killing in,\u0027 I said. \u0027You could go insane in there.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s try both,\u0027 Olga agreed. \u0027I\u0027ve got plenty of experience.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-11.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night Watch (Watch, #1) \n This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
