But they\u0027re scum, they\u0027re inhuman, they have to be to do something like that. I\u0027d strangle them all with my bare hands . . .\u0027 I kept quiet. The driver\u0027s aura was blazing bright scarlet. I didn\u0027t want him to crash, he was almost out of control. My thrust had been too accurate – he had a little daughter of his own . . . \u0027String them up from the telegraph poles!\u0027 he went on, still raging. \u0027Burn them with napalm!\u0027 I kept quiet and waited until the driver had gradually calmed down. Then I asked: \u0027Then what about those universal moral commandments? If they gave you a machine gun now, you\u0027d press the trigger without even hesitating.\u0027 \u0027There aren\u0027t any commandments that apply to monsters!\u0027 the driver snarled. His calm cultured manner had disappeared without trace now! Energy was streaming out of him in all directions . . . and I soaked it up, quickly replenishing the power that I\u0027d spent earlier that morning. \u0027Not even terrorists are monsters,\u0027 I said. \u0027They\u0027re human beings. And so are you. And there are no commandments for human beings. That\u0027s a scientifically proven fact.\u0027 As I drew in the energy that was pouring out of him, the driver calmed down. It wouldn\u0027t last long, of course. That evening the pendulum would swing back, and he\u0027d be overcome by rage again. It\u0027s like pumping all the water out of a well very quickly – it comes rushing back in again. \u0027But even so, you\u0027re not right,\u0027 he replied more calmly. \u0027Logic does exist, of course, yes . . . But if you compare things with the Middle Ages, then morality has definitely advanced.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be ridiculous!\u0027 I said, shaking my head. \u0027How has it advanced? . . . Even in the wars back then they had a strict code of honour. A war then was a real war, and kings fought with their armies, risking their thrones and their heads. And now? A big country wants to put pressure on a little one, so it bombs it for three months and gets rid of its outdated armaments at the same time. Not even the soldiers risk their lives! It\u0027s the same as if you drove up onto the pavement and started knocking down pedestrians like skittles.\u0027 \u0027The code of honour was for the aristocrats,\u0027 the driver objected sharply. \u0027The common people died in droves.\u0027 \u0027And is it any different today?\u0027 I asked. \u0027When one oligarch settles scores with another, there\u0027s a certain code of honour that\u0027s observed! Because both of them have goons to kill for them, compromising information about each other, interests in common, family ties. They\u0027re just like the old aristocracy! Kings sitting up to their ears in cabbage. And the common people are trash. A herd of sheep that are good for shearing, but sometimes it\u0027s more profitable to slaughter them. Nothing\u0027s changed. There never were any commandments, and there aren\u0027t any now!\u0027 The driver fell silent. And after that he didn\u0027t say another word all the way. We turned off Kamergerskaya Street onto Tverskaya Street and I told him where to stop. I paid, deliberately giving him more than I should have. It was only then that he spoke again. \u0027I\u0027ll never give a witch a lift again,\u0027 he told me with a crooked grin. \u0027It\u0027s too hard on the nerves. I never thought a conversation with a beautiful girl could spoil my mood so badly.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I said and smiled sweetly. \u0027Have a good day at . . . work.\u0027 He slammed the door and drove off abruptly. Well, well. I\u0027d never been taken for a prostitute before, but he seemed to think that was what I was. That was the effect of the paranjah . . . and the area of town, of course. But at least I\u0027d more than made up for the power I\u0027d used earlier. He\u0027d turned out to be a magnificent donor, this intelligent, cultured, strong man. The only time I\u0027d ever done better was ... it was with the Prism of Power. I shuddered at the memory. It had all been so stupid . . . everything about it had been so monstrously stupid. My entire life had gone downhill as a result. I\u0027d lost everything in a single moment. \u0027You fool! You greedy fool!\u0027 It was a good thing that nobody could see my real face. It probably looked about as pitiful as my stupid young neighbour\u0027s. Anyway, what was done was done. I couldn\u0027t turn back the clock, put things right and win back ... his affection. It was my own fault, of course. And I ought to be glad that Zabulon hadn\u0027t handed me over to the Light Ones. He used to love me. And I loved him ... it would have been absurd for a young, inexperienced witch not to fall in love with the head of the Day Watch when he took a special interest in her . . . My fists were clenched so tight that the nails were biting into the skin. I\u0027d struggled through. I\u0027d survived last summer. The Dark only knew how, but I\u0027d survived. And now there was no point in remembering the past and snivelling and trying to catch Zabulon\u0027s eye again. He hadn\u0027t spoken to me since the hurricane last year, the one that had hit on the day when I was captured so shamefully. And he wouldn\u0027t speak to me for a hundred years, I was sure of it. A car moving slowly along the kerb stopped with a quiet squeal of tyres. It was a decent car, a Volvo, and it hadn\u0027t come from the tip. A jerk with a shaven head stuck his smug face out of the window, looked me up and down and broke into a satisfied smile. Then he hissed. \u0027How much?\u0027 I was dumbstruck. \u0027For two hours – how much?\u0027 the idiot with the shaved head asked more precisely. I looked at the number plate – it wasn\u0027t from Moscow. So that was it. \u0027The prostitutes are further down, you twit,\u0027 I said amiably. \u0027Get lost.\u0027 \u0027Anyone would think you didn\u0027t screw,\u0027 the disappointed idiot said, trying to save face. \u0027Think it over, I\u0027m feeling generous today.\u0027 \u0027You hold on to your money,\u0027 I advised him and clicked my fingers. \u0027You\u0027ll need it to fix your car.\u0027 I turned my back on him and walked towards the building. My palm was aching slightly from the recoil. The \u0027gremlin\u0027 isn\u0027t a very complicated spell, but I\u0027d cast it in too much of a hurry. I\u0027d left the Volvo with an incorporeal creature fiddling about under its hood – not even a creature really, but a bundle of energy with an obsessive passion for destroying technology. If he was lucky, his engine was finished. If he was unlucky, then his fancy bourgeois electronics would blow – the carburettors, the ventilators, all those gearwheels and drivebelts that the car was full of. I\u0027d never taken any interest in the insides of a car except in the most general terms. But I had a very clear idea of the effects of the \u0027gremlin\u0027. The disappointed driver drove off without wasting too much time arguing. I wondered if he\u0027d remember what I\u0027d said when his car started going haywire. He was bound to. He\u0027d cry \u0027She hexed it, the witch!\u0027 And he wouldn\u0027t even know just how right he was. The thought amused me, but nevertheless, the day had been hopelessly spoiled. I was five minutes late for work, and there was that quarrel with my mother, and that idiot in the Volvo . . . With these thoughts in my head I walked past the magnificent, gleaming shop windows, raised my shadow from the ground in a pure reflex action, without even thinking about it, and entered the building through a door that ordinary people can\u0027t see. The headquarters of the Light Ones, near the Sokol metro station, is disguised as an ordinary office. We have a more respectable location and our camouflage is a lot more fun. This building – seven floors of apartments above shops that are luxurious even by Moscow standards – has three more floors than people think. It was specially built that way as the Day Watch HQ, and the spells that disguise the building\u0027s real appearance are incorporated into the very bricks and stone of the walls. The people living in the building, who are mostly perfectly ordinary, probably feel a strange sensation when they take the lift. As if it takes too long to get from the first floor to the second . . . The lift really does take longer than it should. Because the second floor is really the third, and the real second floor is invisible – it houses our duty offices, armaments room and technical services. Our two other floors are on the top of the building, and no human being knows about them either. But any Other who is powerful enough can look through the Twilight and see the severe black granite of the walls and the arches of the windows that are almost always covered with thick, heavy curtains. Ten years ago they installed air-conditioning, and the clumsy boxes of the split systems appeared on the walls. Before that the internal climate was regulated by magic, but why waste it like that, when electricity is much cheaper? I once saw a photograph of our building taken through the Twilight by a skilful magician. It\u0027s an incredible sight! A crowded street with people walking along it all dressed up, and cars driving along. Shop windows and apartment windows ... a nice old lady looking out of one window, and a cat sitting in another one, looking disgruntled and gloomy – animals can sense our presence very easily . . . And in parallel with all this – two entrances to the building from Tverskaya Street, with the doors standing open, and in one doorway there\u0027s a young vampire from security, polishing his nails with a file. Directly above the shops there\u0027s a strip of black stone, with the crimson spots of windows in it . . . And the two top floors seem to weigh down on the building like a heavy stone cap. If only I could show that photograph to the people who live there. But then, they\u0027d all think the same thing – a clumsy piece of photomontage. Clumsy, because the building really does look awkward . . .When everything was still all right between Zabulon and me, I asked him why our offices were located so oddly, mixed up with the humans\u0027 apartments. The boss laughed and explained that it made it more difficult for the Light Ones to try any kind of attack – innocent people might get killed in the fighting. Everybody knows that the Light Ones don\u0027t really worry about people at all. But they have to hedge round what they do with all sorts of hypocritical tricks, and so the seven floors of apartments make a really reliable shield. The tiny duty office on the ground floor, with the two lifts (the people living in the building don\u0027t know about them either) and the fire stairs, seemed to be empty. There was no one behind the desk or in the armchair in front of the television. It took me a moment to spot the two security guards who should have been there according to the staff list: a vampire – I think his name was Kostya – who had only joined the Watch very recently, and the werewolf Vitaly from Kostroma, also a civilian employee, who\u0027d been working for us as long as I could remember. Both the guards were standing quite still, doubled over in the corner. Vitaly was giggling quietly. Just for an instant I had a quite crazy idea about the reason for such strange behaviour. \u0027Boys, what\u0027s that you\u0027re doing over there?\u0027 I asked sharply. There\u0027s no point in being too polite with these vampires and shape-shifters. They\u0027re primitive beasts of labour – and as well as that the vampires are non-life, but they still claim to be no worse than magicians and witches. \u0027Come here, Aliska!\u0027 Vitaly said, beckoning to me without turning round. \u0027This is a real gas.\u0027 But Kostya straightened up sharply and took a step backwards, looking a bit embarrassed. I walked over. There was a little grey mouse dashing around Vitaly\u0027s feet. It stopped dead still, then jumped up in the air, then began squeaking and beating desperately at the air with its little paws. I didn\u0027t understand for a moment, until I tried looking through the Twilight. So that was it. There was a huge, glossy cat jumping about beside the mouse. Sometimes it reached its paw out towards the tiny creature, sometimes it snapped its jaws together. Of course, it was only an illusion, and a primitive one at that, created exclusively for the small rodent. \u0027We\u0027re seeing how long it can hold out!\u0027 Vitaly said happily. \u0027I bet it will die of fright in a minute.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 I said, beginning to see red. \u0027Now I understand. Having fun are we? Did your hunting instincts get the better of you?\u0027 I reached down and picked up the mouse that had frozen dead still in fear. The tiny bundle of fur trembled on my hand. I blew on it gently and whispered the right word. The mouse stopped trembling, then it stretched out on my palm and went to sleep. \u0027What\u0027s it to you?\u0027 Vitaly asked in a slightly offended tone. \u0027Aliska, in your line of work you\u0027re supposed to boil these creatures alive in your cauldron!\u0027 \u0027There are a few spells like that,\u0027 I admitted. \u0027And there are some that require the liver of a werewolf killed at midnight.\u0027 The werewolf\u0027s eyes glittered brightly with malice, but he didn\u0027t say anything. His rank was too low to try arguing with me. I might only be a simple patrol witch, but that made me a cut above a mercenary werewolf. \u0027All right, then, you guys, tell me the procedure to be followed following the discovery in the premises of rodents, cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes,\u0027 I said in a slow, lazy voice.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-75.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
