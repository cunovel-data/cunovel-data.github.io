{"id":101372,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"\u0027The hussars knew how to smile. But we hardly ever do.\u0027 \u0027Then tell me what I ought to do?\u0027 I said, realising that what had promised to be a lovely day was rapidly running downhill into a dark, stinking ravine filled with old garbage. \u0027Tell me! You\u0027re a Great Sorceress, or you soon will be. A general in our war. I\u0027m just a simple lieutenant. Give me my orders, and make sure they\u0027re the right ones. Tell me what I should do!\u0027 I noticed that the entire room had fallen silent, everyone was listening to us. But at this stage I didn\u0027t care. \u0027Tell me to go out in the street and kill Dark Ones, and I\u0027ll go. I\u0027m not very good at it, but I\u0027ll give it my best shot. Tell me to smile and shower Good on the people, and I\u0027ll go and do it. Good and Evil, Light and Dark, we use these words so often we lose sight of what they mean, we hang them out like flags and leave them to rot in the wind and the rain. Then give us a new word! Give us new flags! Tell me where to go and what to do!\u0027 Her lips started to tremble. I stopped short, but it was too late. Svetlana sat there crying, with her hands over her face. What on earth was I doing? Had we really forgotten how to smile at each other? Maybe I was right, a hundred times right, but. . . What was my truth worth, if I was prepared to defend the entire world, but not those who were close to me? If I subdued hate, but wouldn\u0027t give love a chance? I jumped up, put my arm round Svetlana\u0027s shoulders and led her out of the room. The magicians all stood there, looking the other way. Maybe it wasn\u0027t the first time they\u0027d seen scenes like this. Maybe they understood the whole thing. \u0027Anton.\u0027 Tiger Cub appeared beside me, soundlessly. She pushed me forwards and opened the door, looking at me with both reproach and unexpected understanding. Then she left us alone. We stood there for a moment without moving. Svetlana cried quietly, sobbing into my shoulder, and I waited. It was too late for words now. I\u0027d said far too much already. \u0027I\u0027ll try.\u0027 I hadn\u0027t been expecting that. Anything at all: resentment, counter-attack, complaints, anything but that. Svetlana took one hand away from her wet face. She shook her head and smiled. \u0027You\u0027re right, Antosha. Absolutely right. So far all I\u0027ve done is complain and protest. I whine like a child and I don\u0027t understand anything. Everyone just sticks my nose into my porridge and let\u0027s me play with fire and waits for me to grow up a bit. So I\u0027ll just have to do it, I\u0027ll try, I\u0027ll give you new flags.\u0027 \u0027Sveta—\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 she interrupted. \u0027Only I\u0027m a little bit right too. But I shouldn\u0027t have let go like that in front of the others, I know that. They\u0027re only having fun the best way they know how. Today\u0027s a day off, and nothing should be allowed to spoil it. Deal?\u0027 I felt that wall again. The invisible wall that would always stand between me and Gesar, between me and the bosses. The wall that time would build between us. That day I\u0027d laid a few rows of cold crystal bricks with my own hands. \u0027Forgive me, Sveta,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Forgive me.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s forget it,\u0027 she said very firmly. \u0027Let\u0027s forget it. While we still can forget.\u0027 We eventually looked around us. \u0027The study?\u0027 Sveta guessed. Stained oak bookshelves with the volumes protected by dark glass. A massive desk with a computer on it. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Does Tiger Cub live alone, then?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said, shaking my head. \u0027We don\u0027t usually ask about things like that.\u0027 \u0027It looks as if she does. Right now, at least.\u0027 Svetlana took out her handkerchief and began wiping her tears away. \u0027She has a nice house. Let\u0027s go, everyone must be feeling awkward.\u0027 I shook my head: \u0027They must have sensed that we\u0027re not quarrelling.\u0027 \u0027No, they couldn\u0027t have. There are barriers between all the rooms here, you can\u0027t sense anything through them.\u0027 I looked through the Twilight and spotted the concealed glimmering in the walls. \u0027I see it now. You\u0027re getting more powerful with every day.\u0027 Svetlana smiled, tensely, but with pride. She said: \u0027It\u0027s strange. Why put up barriers if you live alone?\u0027 \u0027And why build them if you don\u0027t?\u0027 I asked in a low voice that didn\u0027t require an answer. Svetlana didn\u0027t try to give me one. We walked out of the study back into the sitting room. The atmosphere wasn\u0027t entirely funereal, but it was close. Either Semyon or Ilya had made a supreme effort and filled the room with a damp, marshy smell. Ignat was standing with his arms round Lena and gazing miserably at everyone else. He liked to have fun, in any form, any quarrelling or tension was like a knife in the heart to him. The card-players were staring silently at a single card lying on the table, and as they looked at it, it twitched, changing suit and value. Yulia looked sulky. She was asking Olga something in a quiet voice. \u0027Will someone pour me a drink?\u0027 Sveta asked, holding me by the hand. \u0027Didn\u0027t you know the best medicine for hysterical women is fifty grams of cognac?\u0027 Tiger Cub, who had been standing by the window looking unhappy, walked quickly across to the bar. Did she really blame herself for our row? Sveta and I took a glass of cognac each, clinked glasses demonstratively and kissed each other. I caught Olga\u0027s look: not delighted, not sad, just interested. And just slightly jealous. I suddenly had a bad feeling. As if I\u0027d emerged from a labyrinth I\u0027d been wandering around in for days, for months. And all I saw when I came out was the entrance to the next set of catacombs. CHAPTER 2 IT WAS another two hours before I got a chance to talk with Olga alone. The jollity that had seemed so forced to Svetlana had already moved outside. Semyon was in charge of the barbecue, handing out kebabs to anyone who wanted them – they seemed to cook at a speed that definitely hinted at the use of magic. There were two crates of wine standing in the shade nearby. Olga was chatting amicably with Ilya, each of them holding a skewer of kebab and a glass of wine. It was a shame to interrupt, but. . . \u0027Olga, I need to have a word with you,\u0027 I said, crossing towards them. Svetlana was engrossed in an argument with Tiger Cub – an intense discussion about the Watch\u0027s traditional New Year Carnival, which they\u0027d moved on to from the subject of the hot weather. The moment was just right. \u0027Excuse me, Ilya,\u0027 said Olga with a shrug. \u0027We\u0027ll come back to this, okay? I\u0027m intrigued by your views on the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even though you\u0027re wrong.\u0027 Ilya smiled exultantly and walked off. \u0027Ask away, Anton,\u0027 Olga said to me in exactly the same tone. \u0027Do you know what I\u0027m going to ask?\u0027 \u0027I think I can guess.\u0027 I glanced around. There was no one near us. It was still that brief moment at the beginning of a dacha picnic when people want to eat and they want to drink, before their stomachs and their heads start to feel heavy. \u0027What\u0027s going to happen to Svetlana?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not easy to read the future. Especially the future of Great Magicians and Sorceresses . . .\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t avoid the issue,\u0027 I said, looking into her eyes. \u0027Stop it. We worked together, didn\u0027t we? We were partners? When your punishment was still in force and you didn\u0027t even have that body. And your punishment was just.\u0027 The blood drained from Olga\u0027s face. \u0027What do you know about my offence?\u0027 \u0027Everything.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 \u0027I work with the data, after all.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t have high enough clearance. And what happened to me has never been entered in the electronic archive.\u0027 \u0027Circumstantial evidence, Olya. You\u0027ve seen ripples running across water, haven\u0027t you? The stone might be lying on the bottom already, deep in the silt, but the ripples still keep on going. Eroding the banks, casting up muck and foam, even overturning boats if the stone was really big. Let\u0027s just say I\u0027ve spent a long time standing on the bank, standing and watching the waves wearing it away.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re bluffing.\u0027 \u0027No. Olga, what happens to Sveta, after this? What stage of the training?\u0027 The sorceress looked at me, completely forgetting her cold kebab and half-empty glass. I struck again. \u0027You\u0027ve been through that stage, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 It looked as if she was going to open up. \u0027I have. But I was prepared for it more slowly.\u0027 \u0027So what\u0027s the great hurry with Sveta?\u0027 \u0027Nobody was expecting another Great Sorceress to be born this century. Gesar had to improvise, make things up as he went along.\u0027 \u0027Is that why they let you have your old form back? Not just for doing a good job?\u0027 \u0027You say you understand everything!\u0027 said Olga, and her eyes glinted angrily. \u0027So what\u0027s the point of tormenting me?\u0027 \u0027Are you monitoring her training? On the basis of your own experience?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Satisfied?\u0027 \u0027Olga, we\u0027re on the same side of the barricades,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Then don\u0027t try and stop your comrades getting on with the job.\u0027 \u0027Olga, what\u0027s the final goal? What was it you couldn\u0027t do? What is it Sveta has to do?\u0027 \u0027You . . .\u0027 she said, genuinely confused now. \u0027Anton, you were bluffing!\u0027 I didn\u0027t answer. \u0027You don\u0027t know anything! Ripples on the water! You don\u0027t even know which way to look to see them!\u0027 \u0027Maybe so. But I got the most important thing right, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 Olga looked at me and bit her lip. Then she shook her head. \u0027You did. A straight answer to a straight question. But I\u0027m not going to explain anything. You shouldn\u0027t even know about it. It doesn\u0027t concern you.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong.\u0027 \u0027None of us wishes Sveta any harm,\u0027 Olga said sharply. \u0027Is that clear?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know how to wish anyone harm. It\u0027s just that sometimes our Good is no different from Evil.\u0027 \u0027Anton, let\u0027s stop right there. I have no right to answer your questions. And we shouldn\u0027t spoil this surprise holiday for the rest.\u0027 \u0027Just how much of a surprise is it?\u0027 I asked suggestively. \u0027Well, Olya?\u0027 But she\u0027d already pulled herself together, and her expression remained impenetrable. Much too impenetrable for a question like that. \u0027You\u0027ve found out too much already.\u0027 Her voice was louder, it had assumed its former tone of authority. \u0027Olya, we\u0027ve never been sent off on holiday all at the same time before. Not even for one day. Why has Gesar sent all the Light Ones out of Moscow?\u0027 \u0027Not all.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-55.html","bookId":2623,"book":{"id":2623,"title":"The Night Watch (Watch #1)","description":"Storyline: Night Watch (Watch, #1) This epic saga chronicles the eternal war of the “Others,” an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light.
