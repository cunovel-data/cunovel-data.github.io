She heard screams, but it was like they were coming from the end of a long tunnel. A hardwood floor pressed into her back. A musty, closed-up scent assaulted her nostrils. Something wet pooled on her face—she wondered vaguely if it was blood.\\n\\n Soft fabric brushed up against her bare arm. Breath warmed her skin. “Hel o?” Emma struggled to say. It took an enormous effort to form the words. “Hel o?” she said again. “Who’s there?”\\n\\n A figure moved away. The floorboards creaked. There was something wrong with Emma’s vision. Someone loomed nearby, but al she could see was a black blob. She heard squeaking sounds, smel ed chalk dust. What was going on?\\n\\n A few seconds later, her vision focused. The blob was gone. Sitting in front of her was a large upright chalkboard from an old set. Emma had passed it countless times during the party preparations today, noting that someone had written a quote from The Glass Menagerie on it:\\n\\n “Things have a way of turning out so badly.” Those words had been wiped away now, and a new message had taken its place. As soon as Emma read the slanted handwriting, her blood went cold.\\n\\n Stop digging, or next time I’ll hurt you for real. Emma gasped. “Who’s there?” she screamed. “Come out!”\\n\\n “Say something!” I yel ed, too, as blind as she was. “We know you’re there!”\\n\\n But whoever had written the note didn’t answer. And then the warm, throbbing darkness began to take hold of Emma once more. Her eyes fluttered, and she fought to keep them open. Just before she passed out again, she caught sight of the same blurry figure—or maybe two blurry figures—\\n\\n swirling their hands over the chalkboard, wiping the words clean.\\n\\n The next time Emma opened her eyes, she was lying on a bed in a smal white room. An instructional sheet on how to properly wash one’s hands hung on the opposite wal . Another poster for how to administer the Heimlich maneuver hung over a smal table that contained jars of cotton swabs and boxes of latex gloves.\\n\\n “Sutton?”\\n\\n Emma turned toward the voice. Madeline sat on an office chair next to the cot, her knees pressed tightly together, her fingers knotted in her lap. When she saw that Emma was awake, relief flooded her face. “Thank God! Are you okay?”\\n\\n Emma lifted her arm and pressed it to her forehead. Her limbs felt normal again, not fil ed with sand like they had as she lay on the stage floor. “What happened?” she croaked.\\n\\n “Where am I?”\\n\\n “It’s al right, dear,” said another voice. A lanky woman with dishwater-blond hair cut bluntly to her chin and a pair of tortoiseshel glasses perched on her nose swam into view. She wore a white lab coat that had the words T. GROVE and NURSE stitched on the breast. “It appears you fainted. It was probably from low blood sugar. Have you had anything to eat today?”\\n\\n “A light fel from the rafters and almost hit you,” Madeline said in a shaking voice. “It was crazy—it almost landed on your head!”\\n\\n Emma squinted, remembering the blurry figure above her. The warning in white chalk. Her heart began to race, thudding so hard against her chest she was scared Madeline and the nurse could hear it. “Did you see someone standing over me when I was lying on the ground? Someone writing something on that chalkboard?”\\n\\n Madeline narrowed her eyes. “What chalkboard?”\\n\\n “Someone wrote something,” Emma insisted. “Are you sure it wasn’t Gabby? Lili?”\\n\\n An expression Emma couldn’t read flitted across Madeline’s face. “I think you need to rest some more. Gabby and Lili were on the stage when the light fel . The custodian said it was just a freak accident—those lights are super-old.” She patted Emma’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry to do this, but I have to get back to the auditorium—Charlotte wil have my head if I’m not there to help direct the caterers.” Madeline stood. “Just take it easy, and I’l check on you when the party’s over, okay?”\\n\\n The bul etin board on the back of the door swung back and forth as Madeline pul ed it shut behind her. The nurse murmured that she’d be back in a moment, too, and slipped out another door. In the silence of the tiny room, Emma shut her eyes, leaned back against the cot’s rockhard pil ow, and exhaled. Don’t you think you should take your place now, Sutton?\\n\\n Gabby had said just before the ceremony began. You’re at stage left, right? And then Lili had run back upstairs for her iPhone, right where the light was fastened. And then . . . crash. The light hit exactly where she was supposed to be standing.\\n\\n “Emma?”\\n\\n Emma opened her eyes to see Ethan hovering over her, his dark eyebrows furrowed with concern. He was dressed in a worn olive-green T-shirt, dark-wash jeans, and black Vans that looked as though they’d been through a wood chipper. She felt the heat of his body as he stepped closer. He took her hand, then glanced away, as if unsure whether touching her was okay. Emma hadn’t been alone with him since the art opening—since she’d rejected him. She sat up quickly and smoothed her hair. “Hey,” she croaked.\\n\\n Ethan let go of her hand and dropped down on the black office chair Madeline had just occupied. “I heard a crash backstage. Next thing I know, people were cal ing your name. What the hel happened?”\\n\\n A shudder ran through Emma’s body as she told him about the light and the note on the chalkboard. When she was finished, Ethan stood up halfway, his arm muscles taut as he held his body inches above the chair. “Is the message stil there?”\\n\\n “No. Someone erased it.”\\n\\n He sank onto the chair again. “There were a ton of people backstage as soon as the crash happened. Someone would’ve seen al that, don’t you think?”\\n\\n “I know it doesn’t make sense. But there was someone there. Someone wrote that message.”\\n\\n He gave her the same look Madeline had. “You’ve been under a lot of stress. Are you sure it wasn’t a dream?”\\n\\n “It didn’t feel like a dream.” Emma pul ed the nurse’s blanket tighter around her, feeling sweat from her palms melt into the rough wool. “I think it was the Twins,” she said. She hushed her voice and told Ethan about what Charlotte and Madeline had said about Sutton doing something to Gabby that landed her in the hospital. Then she told him about the pil bottle Gabby had removed from the bag. “It was something cal ed Topamax. I’ve seen Gabby popping pil s before, but I always thought it was a party thing. Do you have your phone? I need to Google it.”\\n\\n “Emma,” Ethan said, urgency in his voice. “Someone just told you to stop digging.”\\n\\n Emma sniffed. “I thought you didn’t believe me about the board.”\\n\\n “Of course I believe you—I just hoped it wasn’t true.”\\n\\n Ethan’s eyes burned a dark blue under the florescent lights.\\n\\n “I think it’s time we put an end to this.”\\n\\n Emma ran her hands down the length of her face. “If we stop, that means whoever did this to Sutton wil have gotten away with murder.” Then she swung her legs over the tiny cot. Blood prickled through her body as she rose to her feet.\\n\\n “What are you doing?” Ethan exclaimed, watching her make her way to the filing cabinets along the wal .\\n\\n “Gabby’s medical history wil be on file with the school if there’s any type of problem,” Emma whispered. She yanked open the file cabinet marked E–F and ran her fingers over the worn manila folders until she found FIORELLO, GABRIELLA.\\n\\n Heels clacked along the hal way, and Emma froze, listening as they grew louder and then faded as they passed the nurses office. Emma pul ed out Gabby’s folder and saw that it was crisper than the others, as if it hadn’t done the time to earn worn edges. She thumbed through the contents and let out a low whistle. “Topamax, Gabby’s medicine? It’s to treat epilepsy.”\\n\\n “She has epilepsy?” Ethan narrowed his eyes. “I feel like I would’ve heard about that.”\\n\\n Emma kept reading. “It says the disease was dormant until July, and that ‘an incident triggered the first seizure.’”\\n\\n She raised her eyes to Ethan. “The train prank was in July. What if Sutton caused her epilepsy?”\\n\\n “Jesus.” Ethan’s face paled.\\n\\n Emma slipped the folder back into the drawer and guided it shut with her hip. “The Twitter Twins must have been beyond furious—maybe even angry and crazed enough to plan Sutton’s murder.”\\n\\n Ethan’s eyes were round. “You think the Twins . . . ?”\\n\\n “I’m more sure than ever,” Emma whispered, her mind racing. “I’m positive Lili cut the light, too—she ran upstairs to grab her phone right before it fel . And you should’ve seen the way both the Twins stared at me before I passed out.” Goose bumps covered Emma’s flesh as she pictured it again. “They looked capable of anything.”\\n\\n My mind flashed back to the murderous look in Lili’s eyes on the night of the train prank and the text she sent from the ambulance promising revenge if anything was wrong with Gabby. Thank God Emma had stepped aside before the light crashed on her head. She’d been inches away from joining me here in the in-between.\\n\\n Outside, a flock of birds lifted off from a knot of bushes beneath the nurse’s window. Emma paced the floor. “It makes so much sense,” she whispered. “Gabby and Lili are Twitter and Facebook masters—they could’ve easily hacked on to Sutton’s page, read that first note from me, and sent one back asking me to come to Tucson and wait at Sabino Canyon. They were with Madeline the night she hijacked me at Sabino and dragged me to Nisha’s party, too. Who’s to say Gabby and Lili didn’t suggest the whole kidnapping thing?”\\n\\n Ethan moved the chair back and forth, the caster wheels squeaking, not saying a word.\\n\\n “And they’re such gossip hounds,” Emma went on, pausing by a big poster titled WHAT TO DO IF YOU’RE THE VICTIM\\n\\n OF ASSAULT. “It wouldn’t look suspicious for them to skulk around, spying, listening in. And both of them were at Charlotte’s sleepover last week. They could’ve snuck down and strangled me without tripping the alarm.” Al of Emma’s nerves snapped. She was onto something big—and terrifying. “Lili and Gabby were with Sutton the night she died. It has to be them.”\\n\\n Ethan’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swal owed. “So how do we prove it? How do we nail them?”\\n\\n “With your phone.” Emma held out her hand. Confused, Ethan dropped it in her palm. Emma pul ed up the home page for Twitter and looked again at Gabby’s and Lili’s tweets. On August 28, they were innocuous and random: Love my new Chanel oil blotter! And What are you wearing to Nisha’s party? I was thinking of breaking in my back-2-school purchases. And Avocado burger at California Cookin’, yumness!\\n\\n They sometimes shot off thirty tweets an hour. But on the thirty-first, neither of them had tweeted at al . “That’s odd,”\\n\\n Emma said, sinking back to the cot. “I figured they would’ve bragged about shoplifting with Sutton that day.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-have-i-ever-the-lying-game-2/page-21.html","bookId":2394,"book":{"id":2394,"title":"Never Have I Ever (The Lying Game #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Have I Ever (The Lying Game #2) \\n My perfect life was a lie. \\n Now I\u0027d do anything to uncover the truth. \\n Not long ago, I had everything a girl could wish for: amazing friends, an adorable boyfriend, a loving family.
