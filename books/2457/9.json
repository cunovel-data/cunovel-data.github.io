{"id":80864,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Karen jumped back as bullets cracked into the door. Chunks of rotten flesh spattered up from Ammon\u0027s body; the corpse danced and waved in a shuddering, jerking rhythm of macabre motion. David snatched at the coat of the dead man and yanked, but the door was pinned open by the clatter- ing fire and whoever was shooting was coming closer, the explosive shots louder, the splinters of flesh and wood pelting them with greater force. They were trapped, both exits blocked. Rebecca clutched her Beretta in one shaking hand, watching for a signal from David. He pointed roughly northwest, into the compound, shouting to be heard over the whining, spitting clatter of the automatic fire.\n \"Rebecca, other door! John, Karen, next building, secure! Steve, we cover! Go!\"\n As one, Steve and David leaped out and started to fire, the booming rounds punctuating the lighter hail of deadly ammo. John and Karen charged out at a full run, were instantly swallowed up by the shadows. Rebecca spun and trained her weapon on the back door, her heart pounding in her throat. The walls trembled and shook. \"Die, Jesus, why won\u0027t they die?\" Steve screamed behind her, a strain of disbelief and terror in his voice that made her blood run cold.\n ... zombies?\n Without looking away from the rectangle of dark wood, Rebecca shouted as loud as she could, her voice cracking over the relentless spray of the automatics.\n \"Head shots! Aim for the head!\"\n There was no way to know if they\u0027d heard her, the rifle or rifles kept pounding, approaching. Her thoughts raced to understand, images of the T-Virus victims flitting through her mind. They\u0027d been mind- less, slow, inhuman and accidental, not on purpose -not with purpose.\n \"Rebecca, let\u0027s go!\"\n There was still the sound of an automatic rifle firing, but the boathouse no longer shook from the impact of its force. She shot a glance back, saw Steve still shooting at something, saw David motioning at her to move. She sidled for the open door, catching a sickening, up-close look at the bullet-riddled corpse still hanging there. The head had caved in like a rotting pumpkin, teeth shattered, gummy flecks of tissue radiating out from behind the skull. The waving hand was no longer connected to the rotting arm, the radius and ulna blown away. It dangled there like some obscene decoration, beckoning... Steve fired once more and the auto\u0027s clatter ceased. He raised the weapon, his eyes wide and shocked as he opened his mouth to say something...... and the back door crashed open, bullets flying through the dark in a blaze of orange fire. David pushed her roughly through the front and she ran, the responding crack of nine-millimeter rounds resonat- ing behind her.\n - get to the building, get to cover -\n She sprinted through the shadows, her wet shoes thumping across packed, rocky dirt, her searching gaze finding the outline of a massive, concrete block and the spindly trees that surrounded it in the dark- ness ahead.\n \"Here.\"\n She veered toward the call, saw John\u0027s muscular form silhouetted by pale starlight at the corner of the building. As she neared him, she saw the open door, Karen standing in the entry with her weapon trained back toward the boathouse. Bullets still sang through the shadows. \"Get in!\" Karen shouted, stepping out of the way, and Rebecca ran past her, not slowing until she was inside. She fell into a table in the pitch black, cracking one hip painfully against the edge. Turning, she saw Karen firing, heard John yelling,\n \"Come on, come on...\"\n ... and Steve pounded through the door, gasping. He pulled to a stop before crashing into her, one hand clutching his chest. Rebecca moved to the door and grasped the cool thickness, her mind absently registering that the ma- terial was steel as David hurtled through, shouting.\n \"Karen, John!\"\n Karen backed into the darkness, weapon still raised. There were three more sharp reports from a Beretta and then John slipped inside, his jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring. Rebecca slammed the door, her fingers finding a deadbolt switch. The soft snick of the lock was barelyaudible against the ringing in her ears. Outside, the bullets stopped. There were no shouts between the attackers, no alarms, no barking of dogs or screaming of wounded. The sudden silence was total, broken only by the deep, shuddering breathing in the warmand muggy darkness. A halogen beam flickered on, revealing the shocked faces of the team as David shone it around their retreat. A midsize room, crowded with desks and computer equipment. There were no windows. \"Did you see that?\" Steve gasped, addressing no one in particular. \"God, they wouldn\u0027t go down, did you see that?\"\n Nobody answered, and though they were out of immediate danger, Rebecca didn\u0027t feel her adrenaline slowing, didn\u0027t feel her heart settling back to anything approaching normal; it seemed that Umbrella had found a new application for the T-Virus. And like it or not, we\u0027re going to have to deal with the consequences. They were trapped in Caliban Cove. And in this facility, the creatures had guns. David took a final deep breath and exhaled it heavily, flashing the torch\u0027s light toward the door. \"I\u0027d say we\u0027ve been spotted,\" he said, hoping that he didn\u0027t sound as despairing as he felt. \"Might as well see what we\u0027ve gotten into. Rebecca, would you turn on the lights?\"\n She flipped the wall switch and the room snapped into blinding brilliance, overhead fluorescents pulsing to life. Blinking against the sudden glare, David surveyed the team, saw that Steve had one hand pressed to his chest.\n \"Are you hit?\" \"Vest stopped it,\" he said, but he seemed more out of breath than the others, his face paler than it should have been. Rebecca glanced at David with a questioning gaze. He nodded at her.\n Doesn \u0027t appear that we have anywhere else to go... \"Check him out. Anyone else?\"\n Nobody answered as Rebecca stepped up to Steve, motioning for him to take off the vest. David turned and looked around the room, measuring it against the memory of Trent\u0027s map and what little he\u0027d seen from outside. There were a half dozen cheap metal desks, each with a computer and bits of clutter on top. The cement walls were undecorated and plain. There was another door on the west wall that had to lead deeper into the building. \"Karen, secure that,\" he said. They could check out the rest of the site once they\u0027d decided what to do.\n Once you\u0027ve decided, Captain; perhaps you\u0027d like to send them out for a swim? It can\u0027t be any worse than what you\u0027ve already managed...\n David ignored the inner voice, perfectly aware of how badly he\u0027d underestimated the situation. The team didn\u0027t need to see him wallow in self-doubt, it wouldn\u0027t help anything. The question was, what now? \"Let\u0027s talk,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t look like we\u0027re facing an accident after all. What did the note say? The food was drugged, and something about a \u0027he\u0027 killing the others... is it possible that we\u0027re not looking at a T-Virus spill?\"\n Rebecca looked up from her examination of Steve\u0027s chest, the computer expert sitting on one of the desks in front of her. Steve winced as Rebecca\u0027s fingers circled the darkening bruise on his right pectoral. She smiled guiltily at him, shaking her head.\n \"You\u0027re okay. Nothing\u0027s broken.\"\n She turned back to David, the smile falling away.\n \"Yeah. If there\u0027d been a release, that guy on the door, Ammon, would\u0027ve been affected. But the Trisquads - if they\u0027re the result of experiments with the T-Virus, they\u0027d have rotted away by now. It\u0027s been over three weeks since he wrote that note, we should be looking at piles of mush. Either it\u0027s a different virus, or someone\u0027s been taking care of them. Enzyme upkeep, maybe some kind of refrigeration...\"\n David nodded slowly, following her reasoning.\n \"And if that \u0027someone\u0027 had gone mad and killed everyone, why bother?\" \"That corpse, waving at us,\" Karen said thought-fully. \"And the creature or creatures in the cove. It\u0027slike he expected people to come...\"...but didn\u0027t mean for us to get very far,\" John finished. The line from the note ran through David\u0027s mind, the words following the plea to stop \"him.\"\n \u0027God knows what he means to do.\u0027...\n Steve had slipped his shirt back on, shivering from the damp cloth. \"So what do we do now?\" David didn\u0027t answer him, not sure what to say. He felt so drained, so exhausted and uncertain... \"I... our options are to get out or go deeper,\" he said softly. \"Considering what\u0027s happened so far, I don\u0027t feel comfortable making that call. What do you want to do?\"\n David looked warily from face to face, expecting to see anger and disdain; he\u0027d let them down, led them into a perilous situation without a contingency plan, all because he couldn\u0027t stand to see the S.T.A.R.S. tarnished. And now that they were trapped, he didn\u0027t know what to do. The expressions they wore, as a group, were thought- ful and intent. He was surprised to see Karen actually smile, and when she spoke, her tone was brightly eager.\n \"Since you\u0027re asking, I want to figure this out. I want to know what happened here.\" Rebecca was nodding. \"Yeah, me, too. And I still want to get a look at the T-Virus.\"I wanna pick off a few more of those Tri-boys,\" John said, grinning. \"Man, zombies with M-16s, night of the living death squad.\"\n Steve sighed, pushing his wet bangs off his fore-head. \"Might as well keep looking; going back out isn\u0027t exactly safe. It\u0027s not the way I would\u0027ve liked, but getting dirt on Umbrella was the original plan... yeah, I want to nail these bastards.\"\n David smiled, feeling properly embarrassed at him- self. He hadn\u0027t just underestimated the situation, he\u0027dsorely underestimated his team. \"What do you want?\" Rebecca asked suddenly.\"Really?\"\n The question surprised him anew - not because she\u0027d asked, but because suddenly, he didn\u0027t have an answer. He thought about the S.T.A.R.S., about his obsession with his career and what it had already cost them. All he\u0027d wanted for days was to feel as though his life\u0027s work had been meaningful, that it hadn\u0027t been wasted and he\u0027d convinced himself that un- covering the treachery within the job would lay his mind at rest, as if rooting out the corruption would somehow prove that he wasn\u0027t worthless.\n I\u0027ve worshipped at the altar of the organization for so long... but isn\u0027t this the reason why, the real purpose? Here, in this room, on these faces?\n He studied her curious, sharp gaze, felt the rest of them watching him, waiting. \"I want for us to survive,\" he said finally, truth- fully. \"I want for us to make it out of here.\" \"Amen to that,\" John muttered. David remembered what he\u0027d told the Raccoon team, about each of them doing what they did best if they meant to succeed against Umbrella. He\u0027d said it to get Chris\u0027s approval of his operation, but it was a truth that applied to all of them.\n Get to it, Captain... \"John, you and Karen take a look around the building, check the doors, be back in ten. Steve, boot up one of those computers, see if you can find a detailed layout of the grounds. Rebecca, we\u0027ll go through the desks. We want maps, data on Trisquads, T-Virus, anything personal about the researchers that might tell us who\u0027s behind all this.\"\n David nodded at them, realizing that he felt clearer and more balanced than he had in a long, long time. \"Let\u0027s do it,\" he said. To hell with the S.T.A.R.S. They were going to take Umbrella down.\n Dr. Griffith might not have even noticed the securi- ty breach if it hadn\u0027t been for the Ma7s; it seemed that they were useful after all, though not in the way they\u0027d been intended. He\u0027d spent most of the day in the lab, dreamily pondering the pressurized canisters standing by the entrance, the shining steel glittering seductively in the soft light. Once he\u0027d made the decision to let the virus go, he\u0027d realized that there was really nothing else he needed to do. The hours had flown by; each glance at the clock had been a surprise, though not an unpleas-ant one. He\u0027d be the first, after all, the first convert to the new way of the world. With that in front of him, the only task with which he needed to concern himself was getting the canisters up to the lighthouse and with the doctors waiting silently, patiently by, even that was taken care of. Just before dawn, he\u0027d give them their final instructions and then proudly lead the human species into the light, into the miracle of peace. It had been the thought of the Ma7s that had finally drawn him out into the caves, the only concern he hadn\u0027t already dismissed as trivial. He\u0027d already made a mistake with the Leviathans; once he\u0027d taken over the facility, he\u0027d lowered the cove gates on impulse, wanting them to be as free as he\u0027d felt. It wasn\u0027t until the next day that he\u0027d realized Umbrella might find out and come looking, effectively putting an end to his plans. He\u0027d continued to send in weekly reports to keep up appearances, but there was no good explanation for the \"escape\" of the four creatures. It had been sheer luck that the Leviathans had returned on their own. The Ma7s were a different matter entirely, of course. They were too violent, too unpredictable to be let out. But letting them starve to death in their cage didn\u0027t seem right, particularly not when they, too, would enjoy the effects of his gift; it wasn\u0027t their choice to exist as creatures of destruction, even to exist at all. And since he\u0027d played a small role in their creation, he felt a responsibility to do something for them... He\u0027d stood in front of the outer gate for quite some time, considering the problem as all five of the ani- mals hurled themselves repeatedly at the heavy steel mesh, their strange, mournful howls echoing through the damp and winding caves. There was a manual lock release near the enclosure, another in the lab, but there was no way to loose them from the light- house, and he certainly couldn\u0027t let them out before he got to safety. He could send one of the doctors to do it, but the 7s had a much slower metabolism than a human\u0027s, and there was a risk that they would get to him before they made the change. A month before his takeover of the compound, Dr. Chin and two of her vet techs had made the mistake of trying to tend to one of the sick ones; it was a bad way to die, and although he\u0027d be oblivious to the pain once he\u0027d made the transition, he meant to stay with the new world for as long as possible. Griffith had finally decided that euthanasia was the only reasonable choice. It was a reluctant decision, but he could see no alternative. Although the lab was well stocked, poisons weren\u0027t his forte, so he\u0027d de- cided to look up the information on the mainframe and there, in the cold comfort of the sealed laborato- ry, he\u0027d discovered that his sanctuary had been in- vaded. He sat in front of the computer in a kind of shock, staring at the blinking cursor that indicated system use in one of the bunkers. There was no chance that it was a mistake. Except for the lab terminals, the rest of the compound had been powered down weeks ago.\n Umbrella had come.\n The first emotion to break through his stunned astonishment was rage, a sweeping, red-hot fury that tore away all reason, descending over him like a blinding fire. For a few moments, he was lost, his body taken over by the primal force, grasping and rending, tearing at the useless, meaningless things that fell beneath his burning fingers.\n -they will NOT will NOT stop me will NOT-\n When his hands touched the cool metal of the canisters, the fire turned to ash. The smooth, silver tanks were like a splash of reason, bringing him back to himself. His control returned as abruptly as it had gone, leaving him breathless and sweating.\n My creation. My work.\n Blinking, gasping, he found himself standing in a sea of ripped papers, broken glass, and torn circuitry. He\u0027d managed to destroy the computer, the bearer of bad news, in pieces on the cold floor. On another day, he might have been ashamed at the hysterical tan- trum, but on this, his eve of greatness, he allowed that the rage had been justified.\n Justified, perhaps, but pointless. How will you keep them from stopping you? You can\u0027t release the strain here, and you can\u0027t risk taking it outside, not now... what are their plans? How much do they know?\n He could find out easily enough. There were still two other terminals in the lab and he walked quickly to one of them, glancing at the mute doctors, sitting quietly by the airlock. If they\u0027d even noticed his rampage, they gave no sign. He felt a small rush of hatred for them, for creating the useless Trisquads; the \"unstoppable\" guards had failed him now that he needed them most. He sat down and turned on the monitor, impa- tiently waiting for the spinning umbrella of the com-pany logo to disappear. The security network for the compound\u0027s system was based in the lab; he\u0027d be able to see what the intruders were seeking without alert-ing them to his presence, if he could remember how to access the information... He tapped several keys, waited, then typed in his clearance number. After the briefest of pauses, lines of glowing green data spilled across the screen. He\u0027d done it.\n Seek, find, locate...\n He frowned at the information, wondering why the hell anyone from Umbrella would be searching for the laboratory and for that matter, why they\u0027d try look- ing for that information in the mainframe at all. The system designers weren\u0027t idiots, there was nothing about the layout of the facility in the files...\n ... and Umbrella would know it. Which means...\n Relief coursed through him, cool and pure relief so great that he laughed out loud. He suddenly felt quite silly at his childish reaction to the breach. The search- er wasn\u0027t from Umbrella, and that changed every- thing. Even if they managed to find the lab, an unlikely proposition at best, considering its location they wouldn\u0027t be able to gain entry without a key card.\n And Griffith had destroyed all of them...... except for Amman\u0027s. His was never found. Griffith froze, then shook his head, a nervous smile on his face. No, he\u0027d searched practically everywhere for the missing card, what were the chances that the interloper would stumble across it?\n And what were the chances that they\u0027d make it past the Trisquads, hmm? And what was Lyle up to during those hours when you couldn\u0027t find him? What if he did get a message out? You only checked for transmissions to Umbrella, but what if he contacted someone else?\n Even as the dreadful, impossible thought occurred to him, the computer began to spit out information on the logic skills tests. The socio-psychological series tests that Ammon had designed. Griffith felt his control slipping again. He clenched his hands into fists, refusing to give in; there was too much at stake, he couldn\u0027t afford to let his emotions take over, not now, he had to think.\n I\u0027m a scientist, not a soldier, I don\u0027t even know how to shoot, to fight! I\u0027d be useless in combat, totally... Unpredictable. Uncontrollable.\n A slow grin spread across his features. Blood was seeping from his fists, from where his ragged fingernails had dug into the heels of his hands, but he felt no pain. His gaze wandered around the open, silent laboratory, resting briefly on the airlock. Then to the blank, stupid faces of his doctors. To the cylinders of compressed air and virus, his miracle. And finally, to the controls for the mesh gate that led to the animal enclosure. Dr. Griffith\u0027s smile widened. Blood pattered to the floor.\n Let them come. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/caliban-cove-resident-evil-2/page-9.html","bookId":2457,"book":{"id":2457,"title":"Caliban Cove (Resident Evil #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The novel takes place between the events of the Umbrella Conspiracy (Resident Evil 1) and City of the Dead (Resident Evil 2) \u0026 Nemesis (Resident Evil 3) and centers around Rebecca Chambers.
