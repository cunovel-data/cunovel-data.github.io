{"id":80860,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"There was darkness for an indeterminate time, silent and complete and then there were voices, drawing him up through the black depths of his limbo, voices that his floating mind couldn\u0027t identify at first. From somewhere far away, he heard sirens.\n He\u0027s been hit oh my God see if it\u0027s clear wait I can \u0027t find the wound help me-Barry? Barry, can \"Barry, can you hear me?\"\n Rebecca. Barry opened his eyes and then closed them immediately, wincing as the throbbing pain wrapped around his skull. There was another pain in his left arm, sharp and insistent but not as complete as the ache in his head. He\u0027d had acquaintance with both kinds of pain before.\n Got shot, met up with a tree... or some asshole with a baseball bat.\n He tried opening his eyes again as small hands moved across his chest, lightly searching. It took hima second to focus on the worried faces looming over him, Jill and Chris and a frightened-looking Rebecca, her fingers probing his shirt for the wound. The sirens had fallen mercifully silent, though he could hear the cop cars pulling up his street, their powerfully revving engines echoing through the wooded park. \"Left bicep,\" he mumbled, and started to sit up. The dark woods wavered unsteadily, and then Rebecca was gently pushing him back down. \"Don\u0027t move,\" she said firmly. \"Just lay there a second, okay? Chris, give me your shirt.\"But Umbrella...\" Barry started. \"It\u0027s clear,\" David said, kneeling next to the others. \"Be still.\"\n Rebecca lifted his arm carefully, looking at both sides. Barry flexed his arm slightly and scowled at the burst of pain, but could tell it wasn\u0027t bad; the bone was still intact. \"Right out the deltoid,\" Rebecca said. \"Looks like you\u0027re gonna have to lay off the weights for awhile.\"\n Her tone was light, but he could see the concern in her gaze as she studied his face. She started wrapping Chris\u0027s T-shirt tightly around his arm, watching himintently. \"You\u0027ve got a nasty bump on your temple,\" she said. \"How do you feel?\"Though his head was still pounding, the pain had subsided to ache status. He felt light-headed and a little nauseous, but he still knew his own name and what day of the week it was; if it was a concussion, he wasn\u0027t impressed.\n I\u0027ve had worse hangovers... \"Pretty much like shit,\" he said, \"but I\u0027m okay. I must\u0027ve hit a tree on the way down.\"\n As she finished the makeshift bandage, he sat up again, this time with better results. They had to get moving before the cops decided to search the woods, but where could they go? It seemed unlikely that Umbrella would attack twice in one night, but it wasn\u0027t a theory worth testing. None of their homes would be safe. At least his family was out of harm\u0027s way visiting Kathy\u0027s parents in Florida. The thought that they could have just as easily been at home, his girls playing in their rooms when the shooting had started. He staggered unsteadily to his feet, finding strength in the rage that he\u0027d lived with since that night at the estate. Wesker had threatened Kathy and the girls to force Barry\u0027s cooperation in Umbrella\u0027s coverup, using him to get to the underground laboratories. Barry\u0027s guilt had blossomed into fury in the days since, an anger that transcended any he\u0027d ever known. \"Bastards,\" Barry snarled. \"Goddamn Umbrella bastards.\"\n The others stood up with him, Chris\u0027s bare chest pale in the faint light, all of them seeming relieved that he wasn\u0027t badly hurt, except for David, who looked as unhappy as Barry had ever seen him. His shoulders sagged from some unknown burden and when he spoke, he wouldn\u0027t meet Barry\u0027s gaze. \"The man who shot you,\" David said. He held up a nine-millimeter with a suppressor attached, blood spattered across the barrel. \"I killed him. I... Barry, it\u0027s Jay Shannon.\"\n Barry stared at him. He heard the words, but was unable to accept them. It wasn\u0027t possible.\n \"No. You didn\u0027t get a good look, it\u0027s too dark...\"\n David turned and walked through the trees, leading them to the body of the shooter. Barry stumbled after him, his head suddenly aching from more than just smacking it on a tree trunk. It can\u0027t be Shannon, there\u0027s no way, David\u0027s rattled from the attack, that\u0027s all, he made a mistake...... except David didn\u0027t rattle under fire, he never had, and he didn\u0027t make mistakes that easily. Barrygrit his teeth against the pain and followed, for once hoping that his friend was wrong. The man had collapsed on his back or David had rolled him over. Either way, he stared up at them with lifeless eyes, a random pine needle stuck to one of the glazed orbs. The semi-jacketed round from David\u0027s Beretta had punched a hole directly over his heart; it had been a lucky shot. Looking down at the shooter\u0027sashen face, Barry felt his own heart turn to stone.\n Jesus, Shannon, why? Why this? \"Who is he?\" Jill asked softly. Barry stared down at the dead man, Unable to answer. David\u0027s reply seemed hollow, toneless.\n \"Captain Jay Shannon of the Oklahoma City S.T.A.R.S. Barry and I trained with him.\"\n Barry found his voice, still looking at Jay\u0027s still face. \"I called him last week, when I called David. He was worried about us, said he\u0027d keep an eye out for Umbrella...\"... and we shot the shit for another couple of minutes, catching up, telling old stories. I told him I\u0027d send pictures of the kids, and he said that he had to get off the phone, that he wanted to talk but he had a meeting...\n Umbrella must have already got to him, and the realization was cold and brutal and suddenly, horri- bly complete. Umbrella may have been behind the attack, but the S.T.A.R.S. had carried it out. Barry\u0027s home had been blown to hell by people they knew, and he\u0027d been shot by a man he\u0027d thought was a friend. The solemn quiet was broken by the barking of dogs, faint through the shadowy trees. From the number and location, it sounded like the RPD K-9 unit had just reached his house. Barry looked away from the corpse, his thoughts returning to the imme- diate situation. They had to move. \"Where can we go?\" David asked quickly. \"Is there somewhere Umbrella wouldn\u0027t think to look, a cabin, an empty building... someplace we can get to on foot?\" Brad! \"Chickenheart\u0027s lease isn\u0027t up for a couple of months,\" Barry said. \"His place is empty. And it\u0027s less than a mile from here.\" David nodded briskly. \"Let\u0027s go.\" Barry turned toward the park\u0027s playground, leading the others across the moonlit clearing. There was a small trail that let out two blocks away, hopefully far enough away from the action that the cops wouldn\u0027t follow. Barry had walked through the park a million times, his wife at his side, his children dancing at their feet.... my home. This is my home, and it won\u0027t ever be the same again.\n As they ran through the warm, peaceful night, Barry felt the hole in his arm start to bleed again. He clapped his right hand over the sticky dressing with- out slowing, letting the pain fuel his determination as they tore through the scrubby trees and headed for Brad\u0027s house.\n No more. No more of this. My girls aren\u0027t going to grow up in a world where this can happen, not if I have any say in it.\n So much had already happened, and this was only the beginning of their fight. There were still people working with the S.T.A.R.S. he trusted, that they could count on, and he wasn\u0027t going to be caught off his guard twice. The next time Umbrella came knock- ing, maybe they wouldn\u0027t have to run. And if Rebecca and David could pull off the Maine operation, they\u0027d have what they needed to take the company down, once and for all. Umbrella had messed with the wrong people. Barry planned on being there when they figured that out. Jill picked the lock expertly, using a bent safety pin and one of Rebecca\u0027s earrings to open the door to the small cottage. Rebecca had swept Barry off to the medicine cabinet, while Chris went searching for a shirt. David and Jill checked the small house thor- oughly, David\u0027s satisfaction growing with each pass- ing moment. He couldn\u0027t have imagined a better hideout, and it was comforting to know that Barry and the two Alphas would have a safe spot to work from. The two- bedroom home shared a backyard with a security- conscious family; bright lights snapped on when Da- vid opened the back door, flooding the small lawn brilliantly and from the sight of the neighbor\u0027s side, they definitely had a rather large dog somewhere on the premises. There were houses close on either side of the rental, and the front window looked out on an open schoolyard just across the street. There would be no cover for an approaching team. The house was furnished simply, if untidily; it was obvious that the occupant had fled in a panic. Person-al items and books were strewn randomly across the rooms, as if Vickers had been unable to decide what to take in his hurry to flee Raccoon City.\n With what happened tonight, I can\u0027t say I blame him for running...\n Mr. Vickers had obviously been in the wrong line of work, but that didn\u0027t necessarily make him a coward. Risking one\u0027s life on a day-to-day basis wasn\u0027t for Everyone and considering the recent developments, it was wisest for someone like Vickers to remove himself from the situation. They could have used the help, but from what little Barry had told him, the Alpha pilot wasn\u0027t someone they wanted to work with. Even if he didn\u0027t get himself killed, he\u0027d lost the trust of his teammates, and nothing could be worse when it came to crisis situations. David sat in the dark, cramped living room on a rather hideous green couch, collecting his exhausted thoughts as Jill dug through the kitchen. He\u0027d found a blank pad of paper and a pen, and had already scribbled down the names and home numbers of his team and various contacts, as well as Brad\u0027s phone number to take with him. He gazed blankly around the shadowed room, fighting off the adrenaline slump that so often followed battle. He didn\u0027t want to forget anything important, any detail that needed to be discussed before he and Rebecca left. If they wanted to make their plane, Barry, Jill, and Chris would have to deal with the aftermath of the attack on their own.\n The S.T.A.R.S., Trent\u0027s poem, objectives and contacts.\n It was hard to focus after such a draining experi-ence, and it didn\u0027t help matters that he\u0027d been tired to begin with. He hadn\u0027t slept well in days, and thinking of all that lay ahead of them only made concentration harder. Rebecca\u0027s information about Dr. Griffith was disconcerting, to say the least, and though he was no less determined to carry out the Caliban Cove opera- tion, it was just one more concern to add to a seemingly endless list. Chris walked into the room wearing a faded blue sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off and fell into a chair across from David, his face hidden in shadow. After a moment, he leaned forward, enough light filtering through the closed blinds so that David could see his expression. The younger man\u0027s gaze was tired, thoughtful and apologetic.\n \"Look, David... the last couple of weeks have been rough on all of us, you know? Waiting to see what Umbrella was gonna do, the suspension, feeling like our friends died for nothing...\" Chris stopped himself, then started again. \"I just wanted to say I\u0027m sorry if we got off on the wrong foot earlier, and I\u0027m glad you\u0027re on our side. I shouldn\u0027t have been such an asshole about it.\"\n David was surprised and impressed by the sincerity behind the words; when he was in his twenties, he would\u0027ve rather had his fingernails pulled out than display any emotion, except anger of course. He\u0027d had no trouble expressing anger. Yet another legacy from dear old Dad...\n \"I don\u0027t think you have anything to be sorry for,\" David said softly. \"Your concerns are more than justified. I-I\u0027ve been under a bit of strain myself, and I didn\u0027t mean to come across as domineering. The S.T.A.R.S. are, that is, they mean a lot to me, and I want us... I want for them to be whole again...\"\n Jill walked in from the kitchen, saving David from continuing with his fumbling speech. Much to his relief, Chris seemed to understand; he met David\u0027s gaze evenly, nodding, as if to say that the air had been cleared between them. David sighed inwardly, won- dering if he\u0027d ever be able to overcome his awkward- ness with expressing emotions. He\u0027d done a lot of thinking since Barry had first called, about himself and his almost obsessive anger over the S.T.A.R.S. betrayal and had come to the unsettling realization that he wasn\u0027t happy with the way his life was turning out. He\u0027d thrown himself into his career in an effort to avoid dealing with a dysfunc- tional childhood, something he\u0027d always known, but now, facing Umbrella and the treachery of an organi- zation that he considered his family, he\u0027d been forced to really think about the implications of his choice. It had made him an excellent soldier, but he didn\u0027t have any close friends or attachments... and having his \"family\" taken away had come as a cruel wake up to the fact that he had based his life on running from human contact.\n Brilliant for me to have figured it out this late in the game. I suppose I should thank Umbrella for that much; if they don\u0027t kill me, they\u0027ll at least have managed to send me into therapy.\n Jill had brought out a pitcher of water and several mismatched glasses which she passed around as Barry and Rebecca joined them. Barry wore a clean bandage on his arm and seemed pale in the dim light, certainly shaken by their discovery of Captain Shannon. David felt bad about killing Shannon, though he\u0027d recon- ciled himself long ago to the realities of combat; in a war, people died. The captain had made his choice, and it had been the wrong one. They drank in silence, the four Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. (ex-S.T.A.R.S., he reminded himself) pensive and somber, perhaps aware of the ticking clock. He and Rebecca would have to leave in a few moments. There was a convenience store a block away where they could telephone for a cab. David wished he could think of something encouraging to say, but the truth was the truth: they were going on a dangerous mis- sion, and there were no guarantees that any of them would survive to meet again.\n \"Have you thought about what you\u0027ll tell the local police?\" David asked finally. Barry shrugged. \"We won\u0027t have to lie much, any- way. The three of us were at my place, a buncha guys broke in and tried to shoot us. We ran.\" \"Irons will probably try to play it off as a botched burglary,\" Chris sneered. \"If he\u0027s in this as deep as I think he is, he won\u0027t want to call attention to anything Umbrella\u0027s doing.\" \"Just be careful not to mention actually seeing any bodies,\" David said. \"They may have had time to clean up. And you should say that you were chased into the park. It would explain your leaving the scene, as well as Captain Shannon\u0027s body...\"Barry smiled tiredly. \"We\u0027ll handle it. And I\u0027m going to make some calls first thing tomorrow, get us some backup. You just worry about your end, okay?\"\n David nodded and stood up, as did Chris. David shook hands all around and then turned to Rebecca, uncomfortably aware that he was taking her from her teammates and trusted friends. The girl looked at the others in turn with a thoughtful expression and then grinned suddenly, an unaffected and purely wicked smile.\n \"Sure you guys can hold down the fort for a couple of days? I hate to think of you flailing around all directionless while me and David go clean up this Umbrella thing.\" \"We\u0027ll try to limp along without you,\" Chris shot back, smiling. \"Won\u0027t be easy, what with you having the brain and all...\" Rebecca punched him lightly on the shoulder. \"I\u0027ll send you a postcard with instructions.\" She nodded at Barry. \"Take care of your arm. Keep it clean and dry, and if you spike a fever or get dizzy, get to a doctor ASAP.\" Barry smiled. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Jill embraced her lightly. \"Give \u0027em hell, Becca.\" Rebecca nodded. \"You, too. Good luck with Irons.\" She turned to David, still smiling. \"Shall we?\" They walked to the front door together, David wondering at the girl\u0027s easy demeanor. They\u0027d just barely survived a serious attack, carried out by people who\u0027d probably trained her, and she was leaving with a man she hardly knew to embark on a life- threatening mission. She was either putting on an act or was amazingly optimistic and if she was faking the casual bravado, she deserved an award. He watched her carefully as they stepped out into the small, unkempt yard of Brad Vickers\u0027s house, and saw her smile fade, quickly replaced by a look of vague sadness and beyond that, the same kind of focused intensity that she\u0027d had when she\u0027d told them about Dr. Griffith and his research. Whatever she was thinking, he could see in that look that she was perfectly aware of the risks, but that she refused to be cowed by them. The perfect definition of bravery... David was satisfied with his decision to enlist Rebecca Chambers for the operation. She was smart, professional, and committed, as superior in her field of study as the rest of his team members were in theirs. He could only hope that their combined skills would be enough to get them in and out of Caliban Cove in one piece, bringing with them proof of Umbrella\u0027s experiments, an objective that would lead to the ruin of the company that had corrupted the S.T.A.R.S., and perhaps let him sleep peacefully again. David nodded, and the two of them set off to make the call.\n After rereading the information on Caliban Cove, Rebecca folded the papers and carefully tucked them into the overnight bag under David\u0027s seat. He\u0027d bought three bags at the airport, one for the weapons, currently in cargo, the others to carry on so they wouldn\u0027t attract attention. Rebecca wished they\u0027d thought to buy some snacks while they were at it. She hadn\u0027t eaten since lunch, and the packet of nuts she\u0027d swallowed after takeoff wasn\u0027t cutting it. She reached up to switch off the reading light and then settled back in her seat, trying to let the smooth hum of the 747 engines lull her into a doze. Most of the other passengers on the half-full plane were asleep; the dim \"night\" lights and the steady drone of the engines had already worked for David. But even as drained as she felt by the evening\u0027s events, she gave up the effort after a minute or two. There was too much to think about, and she knew that she wouldn\u0027t be able to sleep without at least sorting through some of it.\n I feel like I\u0027m dreaming already anyway; this is just another weird tangent, a subplot that came out of left field...\n In the past three months, she\u0027d graduated college, gone through S.T.A.R.S. Bravo training, and moved to her first apartment in a new city-only to end up one of the five survivors of a man-made disaster involving biological weapons and a corporate con-spiracy. In the past three hours, her life had taken yet another totally unexpected turn. She thought about what she\u0027d wished for earlier, a chance to get out of Raccoon City and study the T-Virus; the irony of the situation wasn\u0027t lost on her, but she wasn\u0027t so sure she liked the circumstances. She rolled her head to the side and looked at David, crashed out in the window seat, dark circles of ex-haustion beneath his closed lids. After briefly filling her in on a few details about the cove and outlining their schedule for the next day, he\u0027d told her to try and take a nap (\"have a lie down\" had been his exact words) and then promptly taken his own advice-not falling asleep so much as lapsing into an instant coma.\n He even sleeps efficiently, no tossing or turning...\n Like he willed himself to get as much rest as possible in the time allowed. He struck her as an extremely competent and intelligent man, if something of a loner, for as cool as he was under pressure, he seemed to freeze with small talk, leading her to wonder what kind of life he\u0027d had. She was impressed with how quickly he\u0027d come up with a plan to get them out of Barry\u0027s house, and was glad that he was leading the operation to Caliban Cove-though it was hard to think of him as a captain. He didn\u0027t really project authority, and didn\u0027t seem to want to, practically insisting that she call him David. Even when he\u0027d stepped into a leadership role during the attack, it hadn\u0027t felt like he was giving them orders so much as offering instruction.\n Maybe it\u0027s just the accent. Everything he says sounds polite...\n He frowned in his sleep, his eyes flickering through uneasy dreams. After a few seconds, he let out a soft, child-like moan of distress. Rebecca briefly consid- ered waking him up, but already he seemed to have got past whatever troubled him, his brow smoothing. Suddenly feeling like she was invading his privacy, Rebecca looked away.\n Dreaming about the attack, maybe. About having to kill someone he knew...\n She wondered if she\u0027d be haunted by the image of the man she\u0027d shot, the shadowy figure that had crumpled to the ground next to Barry\u0027s house. She was still waiting for the guilt to hit her and thinking about it, she was surprised to find that her mind wasn\u0027t racing to rationalize the matter. She\u0027d shot somebody, he could very well be dead and all she felt was relief that she\u0027d stopped him from killing her or anyone else on the team. Rebecca closed her eyes, taking a deep breath of the cool, pressurized air hissing through the cabin. She could smell the musky odor of dried sweat on her skin, and decided that taking a shower was first priority when they hit the hotel. David didn\u0027t want to risk going back to his house on the off chance that someone on the strike force had recognized him, so they were going to grab a couple of rooms near the airport somewhere after they changed planes. The operation briefing was set for noon at the home of one of the other three team members, an Alpha forensics expert named Karen Driver. David had mentioned that Karen could probably lend her some clean clothes, though he\u0027d actually blushed while saying it.\n He was a quirky one, all right...... and after the briefing, we get our equipment and go in, just like that.\n The thought knotted her stomach and sent a chill through her, telling her the real reason she wasn\u0027t able to sleep. Only two weeks after the Umbrella night- mare in Raccoon City, she was facing the same nightmare again. At least this time, she had some idea of what they\u0027d be getting themselves into, and the plan was to get out of the facility without ever facing the T-Virus creatures, but the memory of Umbrel- la\u0027s Tyrant monster was still fresh in her mind, the massive, patchwork body and killing claw of the thing they\u0027d seen on the estate. And the thought of what someone like Nicolas Griffith might have come up with using the virus... Rebecca decided that she\u0027d thought enough, she had to get some sleep. She cleared her mind as best she could and focused on her breathing, slowing it down, counting backward in her mind from one hundred. The meditation technique had never failed her before, though she didn\u0027t think it would work this time... ninety-nine, ninety-eight, Dr. Griffith, David, S.T.A.R.S., Caliban...\n Before she reached ninety, she was deeply asleep, dreaming of moving shadows that no light had cast. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/caliban-cove-resident-evil-2/page-5.html","bookId":2457,"book":{"id":2457,"title":"Caliban Cove (Resident Evil #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The novel takes place between the events of the Umbrella Conspiracy (Resident Evil 1) and City of the Dead (Resident Evil 2) \u0026 Nemesis (Resident Evil 3) and centers around Rebecca Chambers.
