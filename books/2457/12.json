{"id":80867,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"After he\u0027d instructed athens and sent him on his way, he\u0027d prepared the syringes and decided on a place to hide. There was nothing left for him to do but wait. In spite of his earlier feelings of confidence, he was nervous now, pacing through the lab restlessly. What if Athens had forgotten how to load a rifle? What if the enclosure release didn\u0027t work, or the intruders had the firepower to stop the Ma7s? He\u0027d tried to prepare for every possibility, each plan unfolding into a backup, but what if everything failed, if all of them fell through? I\u0027ll kill them myself, I\u0027ll strangle them with my bare hands! They will not stop me from doing what must be done. They can\u0027t - not after all I\u0027ve accomplished, not after everything I\u0027ve been through to get to where I am... For the second time that day, he flashed back to the takeover of the compound... the strange, vivid im- ages of that bright and sunny day less than a month ago. Instead of blocking the thoughts as he\u0027d done before, he let them come, inviting them in to re- mind him of what he was capable of doing when the need arose. He abruptly stopped pacing and moved to a chair, collapsing into it and closing his eyes. A bright and sunny day... Once he\u0027d realized what had to be done, he\u0027d planned it for over two weeks, working over each detail tirelessly until he\u0027d been satisfied that every variable had been addressed. He\u0027d spent time reading about the Trisquads and going through the master logs, memorizing the routine of the facility. He\u0027d watched the habits of his colleagues, learned their schedules until he could have recited them backward. He\u0027d stared for hours at the sketches he\u0027d made of each building, walking through them in his mind a thousand times. After careful consideration, he chose a date and several days before, he\u0027d slipped into the Trisquad processing room and stolen several small vials of extremely powerful medication. Kylosynthesine, Mamesidine, Tralphenide - animal tranquilizers and a synthesized narcotic, some of Um- brella\u0027s finest work... It had only taken him an afternoon to get the mix the way he\u0027d wanted it, just as he\u0027d hoped. Then he\u0027d waited, much as he was waiting now... The day before his plan was to unfold, he\u0027d watched a Trisquad processing and then asked Tom Athens to come to the lab after dinner to privately discuss some thoughts he\u0027d had on intensifying the suggestibility factor. Athens had been only too happy to accept, had listened eagerly to Griffith\u0027s description of the strain he\u0027d already created - couched in hypothetical terms, of course - and after a nice, hot cup of laced coffee, Athens had become the first to experience Griffith\u0027s miracle. Griffith smiled, remembering those initial glorious moments, the very first -and truly the most impor- tant test of the strain\u0027s effectiveness. He\u0027d told Athens that the only voice he could hear was that of Nicolas Griffith, that all others would be meaningless Babble and the suggestion had taken as easy as that. In the early hours of that fateful morning, he\u0027d played a tape of one of Athens\u0027s own lectures for the compli- ant doctor and the doctor had heard nothing but gibberish. If it had failed, Griffith would have aborted the takeover, no one the wiser. He\u0027d had an unfortunate accident in mind if the strain hadn\u0027t worked the way it was supposed to; Athens\u0027s body would have been found the next day, washed up on the rocky beach. But the incredible success of his creation had proved beyond doubt that it was meant to be, that he really had no choice but to continue...... and so, the kitchen. The drops of sedative in the coffee cups, on the pas tries, injected oh so carefully into the fruit and dissolved into the milk, the juices... Of the nineteen men and women who lived and worked in Caliban Cove, only one regularly skipped breakfast and didn\u0027t drink coffee, Kim D\u0027Santo, the ridiculous young woman who worked with the T-Virus; Griffith had sent Athens to slit her throat as she lay sleeping, before the sun came up... and it was a bright and sunny day, cloudless and clear as they gobbled their breakfasts and swallowed their coffee, walking out into the cool morning air, collapsing to the ground, many of them not making it out of the cafeteria before they stumbled and fell, a few crying out that they \u0027d been poisoned as the words failed them and the drugs sent them to sleep. Griffith frowned, trying to remember what had happened next. He\u0027d selected Thurman, unable to resist the petty pleasure of showing the good doctor what he\u0027d created. Then Alan Kinneson, although he hadn\u0027t given the gift to Alan until later, keeping him sedated... He knew the facts: Thurman and Athens had dis- posed of the workers and piled them in block A. Lyle Ammon had managed to keep himself hidden for a time, but had been found by the Trisquads later that evening. Griffith had eaten a late supper and gone to bed, waking up early to move papers and software to the lab. These were facts, things that he knew, but for some reason, the reality had blurred and he couldn\u0027t actually remember what he had seen, what had transpired for him the rest of that day. Griffith searched through his thoughts, concentrat-ing, but could only find the same hazy and uncertain images: a blinding mid-day sun, bathing the sleeping bodies in red. The scream of a gull over the cove, relentless and wild, calling to the hot wind. A coppery smell of dirt and, and... ...blood on my hands, on the scalpel that glittered wet and sharp and plunged into soft, yielding flesh of faces and bellies and eyes and later, the thundering crash of waves in the dark and the spool of fishing line and Amman, Amman, waving... His eyes snapped open and the nightmare was over. Shaken, Griffith looked around at the cool, soft light of the laboratory. He must have dozed off for a moment, must have. Yes, that was it. He\u0027d fallen asleep and had a terrible dream. He looked at the clock, saw that only a few mo- ments had passed since he\u0027d sent the two doctors out. He felt a rush of relief, realizing that he hadn\u0027t been asleep for very long, but as the relief ebbed, he felt the nervousness slip back into his body, jittering and pulsing anxiety about the intruders that had come to his facility. They won\u0027t stop me. It\u0027s mine. Griffith stood up and started to pace restlessly, back and forth, waiting. The \"time rainbow\" test, number seven, took only a moment longer to complete than test number four, what David had started to think of as the \"chess test.\" John and Karen had shown him to the small table in the big room, standing behind him as he\u0027d uprighted the colored tiles and laid them out. Beneath the heap of nine rainbow-shaded pieces was an elongated in-dentation, perhaps a foot long and two inches across; it was clear that just seven of the tiles would fit. Seven colors in the rainbow, seven tiles. Simple. So why are there nine of them? David ordered the pieces by their colors, placing them in a row beneath the indentation. Each bore a different letter on the top, inked in black. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and three violet tiles with three different letters. \"Is it supposed to spell something?\" John asked. Going from left to right, the first six tiles read, J F M A M J. \"Not in English,\" Karen said mildly. The three violet pieces were J, M and P. David sighed. \"It\u0027s one of those where you have to figure out the next in the series,\" he said. \"Apparently relating to time. Any thoughts?\" John and Karen both stared down at the puzzle, studying the letters; he wondered if they were as tired as he was starting to feel. John seemed distinctly less chipper than usual, and Karen looked fairly wiped out, her skin pale and gaze somewhat distant. Of course they\u0027re tired, but at least they\u0027re making an attempt... David looked back at the colored pieces and tried to focus, but couldn\u0027t seem to manage a single coherent idea. It had been an awfully long day, periods of intense concentration interspersed with violent rushes of adrenaline. He\u0027d run through fear, self-doubt, deter- mination and then fear again, plus a handful of less clear-cut emotions. Now he just felt frazzled, waiting to see what would come next... John grinned suddenly, a triumphant light in his eyes. \"The letters stand for the months - January, February, March, April, May, June - July. It\u0027s J, the last letter is J.\" \"Brilliant,\" David said. He started to place the tiles in the indentation as John nudged Karen with his elbow, still grinning. \"And you thought all I was good for was easy sex.\" As usual, Karen didn\u0027t bother answering. Relieved to be through the second test, David pushed the last piece into place. There was a faint click and the rainbow lowered very slightly, perhaps a millimeter. From above them, a gentle chime sounded from a speaker, this one hidden by a fluorescent bar. \"That all I get?\" John quipped. \"No parade?\" David stood up, smiling tiredly. \"I felt the same way with the other one. We should get moving, see how Steve and Rebecca are making out.\" \"Interesting way of putting it, David,\" John said, chuckling. \"Nice one.\" It took David a moment to get it, though Karen rolled her eyes almost immediately, then scratched at them. When she took her hand away, David saw that her right eye was extremely bloodshot. The left was also slightly discolored, though not as badly. She noticed his scrutiny and smiled at him, shrug- ging. \"I irritated it somehow. It itches, but it\u0027s fine.\" \"Don\u0027t rub it, you\u0027ll make it worse,\" David said, leading them toward the door. \"And have Rebecca take a look when we get across.\" They walked back into a connecting corridor and started for the back exit, David steeling himself for another dash across the compound. By his count, they\u0027d managed to take down three of the Trisquads in full; three men outside of the boathouse and a fourth on the run to the first building, then John and Karen\u0027s five between blocks C and D. Useful information, if you happen to know how many of the squads there were to begin with. He ignored the inner sarcasm as they reached the metal door, Karen leaning back to turn off the over- head light. They pulled out weapons and took deep breaths, preparing and David felt a familiar sensa- tion wash over him, one that he\u0027d experienced before in tight situations but had never been able to name. It wasn\u0027t a feeling so much as a state of existence and although not a religious man, it was the closest thing he\u0027d found to a belief in fate, a sense that there were patterns at play beyond the realm of human influence. Whatever was going to happen, whatever was al-ready happening even as they readied themselves to step back outside - all of the deciding factors were now firmly in place, interlocking like pieces of a puzzle. He felt it with a certainty that denied reason. It was as though a great wheel of chance that deter-mined outcome, that would show them life or death, success or failure, had been set into motion and was now spinning toward its inevitable conclusion - only instead of slowing down, the wheel would turn stead-ily faster, speeding up as it revealed to them what the cosmos had planned. In the past, he\u0027d often found comfort in the sudden awareness of that spinning wheel, the undefinable sense that the outcome had been decided and all anyone could do was watch it unfold. When he\u0027d been a child and his father had been on one of his drunken, abusive rampages, the belief in a bigger picture had sometimes been the only thing that saved him from total despair. This time, though... this time, it felt like a terrible thing, a dark and whirling carnival ride that they had boarded by mistake, not realizing the truth until it was too late, that they couldn\u0027t go back, and there was no avoiding whatever lay ahead. We hang on, then. We do what we can. David stepped to the door, flicking the Beretta\u0027s safety off. Whether or not they had any control over what was to come, Rebecca and Steve were waiting. The test room was quiet except for the soft hum from the machines marked with blue numbers, nine through twelve, and the occasional rustle of a turning page as Rebecca went through Athens\u0027s journal. Steve sat on the edge of a table and watched her read, his thoughts restless and uneasy as they waited for the others to show up. His chest ached mildly, both from the small caliber round he\u0027d taken earlier and the anxious build of worry for John and Karen. After a quick look at the other rooms in the building, they\u0027d both agreed that the test room was the place to wait. It seemed that block B of the Umbrella facility was mostly devoted to surgical aspects of the bio-weapons research, the rooms all white and steel, ominously stark and unpleasant. Although the building was as stuffy and warm as the others they\u0027d been in, Steve had felt a physical chill as they\u0027d passed the empty operating rooms - as if the chambers themselves had taken on the characteristics of the T-Virus creatures. Cold and lifeless and some- how mindlessly black with purpose... Rebecca looked up, her eyes flashing with excite- ment. \"Listen to this: \u0027\"They\u0027re still waiting for our feedback on expansion ever since Griffith revved up the amp time. \u0027We\u0027ve got the space for up to twenty units, but I\u0027m going to hold strong on a max of twelve; we wouldn\u0027t be able to concentrate on training more than four squads at a time. Ammon said he\u0027ll back me up if there\u0027s any hassle.\u0027\" Steve nodded, half dismayed and half relieved by the information. They\u0027d already knocked one of the Trisquads out of the running, plus seriously wounded or killed a couple of the individuals on another team; that was good. On the other hand, it meant that there were still a couple of the squads roaming around out there - unless they\u0027re currently \"engaged\" with David and the others... He scowled inwardly, grasping for something else to think about. \"Do you know what that means, \u0027revved up the amp time\u0027?\" Rebecca nodded slowly, worry creasing her brow. \"I\u0027m pretty sure he means that Griffith sped up the amplification process. Amplification is the term for a virus\u0027s spread through a host.\" That didn\u0027t sound like something he wanted to think about either. By some unspoken agreement, they hadn\u0027t talked about the possibility of John or Karen being infected since David had left. \"Great. You find anything else in there?\" She shook her head. \"Not really. He mentions the Ma7s a couple of times, but nothing more specific than that they\u0027re a T-Virus experiment that didn\u0027t work. And he\u0027s definitely kind of an asshole.\" \"Kind of?\" Rebecca smiled briefly. \"Okay, that\u0027s an under-statement. He\u0027s a money-hungry, amoral bastard.\" Steve nodded, thinking about the partial report they\u0027d found on the Trisquads and for that matter, the very existence of the facility. Calling the T-Virus victims \"units,\" setting up operating rooms and apti- tude tests to run them through like rats in a maze - - it\u0027s like they can\u0027t acknowledge that they\u0027re per- forming their experiments on human beings, on real people... \"How could they do this?\" he asked softly, as much to himself as to Rebecca. \"How did they sleep at night?\" Rebecca gazed at him solemnly, as if she had an answer but wasn\u0027t sure how to say it. Finally, she sighed. \"When you specialize in one field, particularly when it\u0027s a field that demands linear thinking and a very defined focus on only one tiny element of some-thing - it\u0027s kind of hard to explain, but it\u0027s frighten-ingly easy to get lost in that single element, to forget there\u0027s a world outside of that element. When you spend your days looking into a microscope, sur-rounded by numbers and letters and processes... some people get lost. And if they were unstable to begin with, the ambition to pursue that element can take over, making everything else unimportant.\" Steve saw what she was getting at and was im- pressed anew with how thoughtful she was, how clearly she communicated herself... ... all that and a smile that lights up a room; if - -when we get out of this, I\u0027m moving to Raccoon City. Or I\u0027ll at least find out if she\u0027s seeing anyone... There was a sound from somewhere in the building, footsteps. Steve pushed himself off the table and walked quickly to the door. He leaned out into the corridor and heard David\u0027s voice calling through the empty block. \"In the back!\" Steve shouted, then waited, anx-iously watching the corner in the hall for David to walk into view, John and Karen both healthy and smiling beside him. Rebecca moved to stand next to Steve, and he saw the same concern and hope written across her delicate features. Instinctively, he groped for her hand, feeling a tingling jolt as their fingers touched, half expecting her to pull away, but she didn\u0027t, leaning against him instead as she held his hand gently, her skin soft and warm on his. John\u0027s booming voice preceded him down the cor- ridor, loud and full of bright good humor. \"Get your clothes on, kids, you\u0027ve got company!\" She dropped his hand quickly, but the look that she flashed him more than made up for it - a sweet and wistful expression that made his heart skip a beat, but there was a maturity there, too, a realization of the circumstances they were in, an acknowledgment of priorities. No more until we\u0027re out of here. He nodded slightly, and they turned to wait for the others.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/caliban-cove-resident-evil-2/page-12.html","bookId":2457,"book":{"id":2457,"title":"Caliban Cove (Resident Evil #2)","description":"Storyline: The novel takes place between the events of the Umbrella Conspiracy (Resident Evil 1) and City of the Dead (Resident Evil 2) \u0026 Nemesis (Resident Evil 3) and centers around Rebecca Chambers.
