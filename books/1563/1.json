{"id":109511,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\u0027d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u0027t hold with such nonsense.\n Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u0027t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u0027s sister, but they hadn\u0027t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u0027t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u0027t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u0027s drive.\n It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u0027t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u0027t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u0027t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u0027t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u0027t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u0027t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u0027t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u0027t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u0027d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n He\u0027d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u0027s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u0027t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u0027t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n \"The Potters, that\u0027s right, that\u0027s what I heard--\"\n \"-- yes, their son, Harry--\"\n Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u0027t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u0027t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u0027d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u0027t blame her -- if he\u0027d had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...\n He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\u0027clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n \"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u0027t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\u0027t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u0027t approve of imagination.\n As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn\u0027t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he\u0027d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n \"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n The cat didn\u0027t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u0027s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\u0027t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u0027s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\n \"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\u0027t know about that, but it\u0027s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u0027ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\u0027s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\n Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u0027d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\u0027t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\n As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u0027t have a sister.\n \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n \"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\n \"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n \"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\"\n Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u0027d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\u0027t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he\u0027d be about Dudley\u0027s age now, wouldn\u0027t he?\"\n \"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n \"What\u0027s his name again? Howard, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n \"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\"\n He didn\u0027t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn\u0027t think he could bear it.\n The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind... He couldn\u0027t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn\u0027t affect them...\n How very wrong he was.\n Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u0027t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u0027d have thought he\u0027d just popped out of the ground. The cat\u0027s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\u0027s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n Albus Dumbledore didn\u0027t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\n He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u0027t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u0027t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n \"My dear Professor, I\u0027ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n \"You\u0027d be stiff if you\u0027d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n \"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n \"Oh yes, I\u0027ve celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You\u0027d think they\u0027d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\u0027s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u0027 dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars... Well, they\u0027re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\u0027ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\n \"You can\u0027t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\u0027ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\u0027s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\n She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u0027t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"\n \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n \"A what?\"\n \"A lemon drop. They\u0027re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u0027m rather fond of.\"\n \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\u0027t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--\"\n \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \u0027You-Know-Who\u0027 nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u0027You-Know-Who.\u0027 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u0027s name.\"\n \"I know you haven\u0027t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\u0027re different. Everyone knows you\u0027re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n \"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"\n \"Only because you\u0027re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\n \"It\u0027s lucky it\u0027s dark. I haven\u0027t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\n Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they\u0027re saying? About why he\u0027s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\n It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n \"What they\u0027re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\u0027s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\u0027re -- dead.\"\n Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n \"Lily and James... I can\u0027t believe it... I didn\u0027t want to believe it... Oh, Albus...\"\n Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know... \" he said heavily.\n Professor McGonagall\u0027s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\u0027s not all. They\u0027re saying he tried to kill the Potter\u0027s son, Harry. But he couldn\u0027t. He couldn\u0027t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\u0027re saying that when he couldn\u0027t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\u0027s power somehow broke -- and that\u0027s why he\u0027s gone.\"\n Dumbledore nodded glumly.\n \"It\u0027s -- it\u0027s true ?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\u0027s done... all the people he\u0027s killed... he couldn\u0027t kill a little boy? It\u0027s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n \"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\n Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\u0027s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u0027d be here, by the way?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027re going to tell me why you\u0027re here, of all places?\"\n \"I\u0027ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u0027re the only family he has left now.\"\n \"You don\u0027t mean - you can\u0027t mean the people who live here ?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore -- you can\u0027t. I\u0027ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u0027t find two people who are less like us. And they\u0027ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\"\n \"It\u0027s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u0027s older. I\u0027ve written them a letter.\"\n \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u0027ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"\n \"Exactly.\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\u0027s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\u0027t even remember! Can you see how much better off he\u0027ll be, growing up away from all that until he\u0027s ready to take it?\"\n Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you\u0027re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n \"Hagrid\u0027s bringing him.\"\n \"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\"\n \"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\n \"I\u0027m not saying his heart isn\u0027t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\u0027t pretend he\u0027s not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?\"\n A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild -- long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"\n \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u0027ve got him, sir.\"\n \"No problems, were there?\"\n \"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u0027 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u0027 over Bristol.\"\n Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n \"Is that where -- ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\u0027ll have that scar forever.\"\n \"Couldn\u0027t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\n \"Even if I could, I wouldn\u0027t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\u0027d better get this over with.\"\n Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\u0027 house.\n \"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You\u0027ll wake the Muggles!\"\n \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\u0027t stand it -- Lily an\u0027 James dead -- an\u0027 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles--\"\n \"Yes, yes, it\u0027s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\u0027ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u0027s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u0027s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u0027s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n \"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\u0027s that. We\u0027ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\u0027ll be takin\u0027 Sirius his bike back. G\u0027night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\n Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u0027 time by Mrs. Dursley\u0027s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\u0027t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-1.html","bookId":1563,"book":{"id":1563,"title":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (Harry Potter #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (Harry Potter #1) \n \n Just before the start of the novel, Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry\u0027s parents but mysteriously vanished after trying to kill Harry.
