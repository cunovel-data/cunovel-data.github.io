{"id":109519,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u0027t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u0027t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"\n He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\n \"You don\u0027t know that you\u0027ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\u0027s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u0027s all talk.\"\n Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u0027t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u0027d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u0027d listen about the time he\u0027d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u0027s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u0027t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u0027s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\n Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u0027d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\n Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u0027t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn\u0027t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\u0027d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\u0027s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n Harry hadn\u0027t had a single letter since Hagrid\u0027s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u0027s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\n \"It\u0027s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there\u0027s something you\u0027ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh... \" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"... you\u0027ve forgotten something...\"\n Neville was trying to remember what he\u0027d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Malfoy\u0027s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\n Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\n At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\n Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n \"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say \u0027Up!\u0027\"\n \"UP\" everyone shouted.\n Harry\u0027s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u0027s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u0027s hadn\u0027t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\u0027s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u0027d been doing it wrong for years.\n \"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two--\"\n But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\u0027s lips.\n \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --\n WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\u0027s all right, up you get.\"\n She turned to the rest of the class.\n \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u0027ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \u0027Quidditch.\u0027 Come on, dear.\"\n Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\n The other Slytherins joined in.\n \"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\n \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\u0027d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"\n \"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\u0027s that stupid thing Longbottom\u0027s gran sent him.\"\n The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n \"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\n Malfoy smiled nastily.\n \"I think I\u0027ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"\n \"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u0027t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"\n Harry grabbed his broom.\n \"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you\u0027ll get us all into trouble.\"\n Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\u0027d found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\u0027ll knock you off that broom!\"\n \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n \"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.\n The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n \"HARRY POTTER!\"\n His heart sank faster than he\u0027d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n \"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts--\"\n Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \" -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck--\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t his fault, Professor--\"\n \"Be quiet, Miss Patil--\"\n \"But Malfoy--\"\n \"That\u0027s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\n Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u0027s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u0027s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\u0027d done it. He hadn\u0027t even lasted two weeks. He\u0027d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\u0027t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u0027s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u0027s bag.\n Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\n \"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"\n Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick\u0027s class looking confused.\n \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n \"In here.\"\n Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n \"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\u0027ve found you a Seeker.\"\n Wood\u0027s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n \"Are you serious, Professor?\"\n \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\u0027s a natural. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\"\n Harry nodded silently. He didn\u0027t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\u0027t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\u0027t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u0027t have done it.\"\n Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.\n \"Wood\u0027s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.\n \"He\u0027s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we\u0027ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\u0027d say.\"\n \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u0027t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u0027t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...\"\n Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n \"I want to hear you\u0027re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"\n Then she suddenly smiled.\n \"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\"\n \"You\u0027re joking.\"\n It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\u0027d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u0027d forgotten all about it.\n \"Seeker ?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about--\"\n \"-- a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\n Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\n \"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\u0027t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\"\n Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\n \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\u0027re on the team too -- Beaters.\"\n \"I tell you, we\u0027re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven\u0027t won since Charlie left, but this year\u0027s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\"\n \"Anyway, we\u0027ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u0027s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\"\n \"Bet it\u0027s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\"\n Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n \"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\"\n \"You\u0027re a lot braver now that you\u0027re back on the ground and you\u0027ve got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n \"I\u0027d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want. Wizard\u0027s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What\u0027s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\u0027s duel before, I suppose?\"\n \"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\u0027m his second, who\u0027s yours?\"\n Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n \"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\u0027ll meet you in the trophy room; that\u0027s always unlocked.\"\n When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\n \"What is a wizard\u0027s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\u0027re my second?\"\n \"Well, a second\u0027s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u0027s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u0027ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"\n \"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"\n \"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested.\n \"Excuse me.\"\n They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n \"Can\u0027t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron.\n Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n \"I couldn\u0027t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying--\"\n \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.\n \"-- and you mustn\u0027t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\u0027ll lose Gryffindor if you\u0027re caught, and you\u0027re bound to be. It\u0027s really very selfish of you.\"\n \"And it\u0027s really none of your business,\" said Harry.\n \"Good-bye,\" said Ron.\n All the same, it wasn\u0027t what you\u0027d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u0027t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you\u0027d better dodge it, because I can\u0027t remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\u0027s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness -- this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\u0027t miss it.\n \"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\u0027d better go.\"\n They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re going to do this, Harry.\"\n A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n \"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"\n \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he\u0027s a prefect, he\u0027d put a stop to this.\"\n Harry couldn\u0027t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n \"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n Hermione wasn\u0027t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n \"Don\u0027t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\u0027t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\u0027ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\"\n \"Go away.\"\n \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\u0027re on the train home tomorrow, you\u0027re so--\"\n But what they were, they didn\u0027t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\n \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\n \"That\u0027s your problem,\" said Ron. \"We\u0027ve got to go, we\u0027re going to be late.\"\n They hadn\u0027t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\n \"I\u0027m coming with you,\" she said.\n \"You are not.\"\n \"D\u0027you think I\u0027m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u0027ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got some nerve -- \" said Ron loudly.\n \"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\"\n It was a sort of snuffling.\n \"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n It wasn\u0027t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n \"Thank goodness you found me! I\u0027ve been out here for hours, I couldn\u0027t remember the new password to get in to bed.\"\n \"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\u0027s \u0027Pig snout\u0027 but it won\u0027t help you now, the Fat Lady\u0027s gone off somewhere.\"\n \"How\u0027s your arm?\" said Harry.\n \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\"\n \"Good -- well, look, Neville, we\u0027ve got to be somewhere, we\u0027ll see you later--\"\n \"Don\u0027t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\u0027t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u0027s been past twice already.\"\n Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\n \"If either of you get us caught, I\u0027ll never rest until I\u0027ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\"\n Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\n They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n Malfoy and Crabbe weren\u0027t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n \"He\u0027s late, maybe he\u0027s chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\n Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -- and it wasn\u0027t Malfoy.\n \"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"\n It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\u0027s voice. Neville\u0027s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n \"They\u0027re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"\n \"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\n The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\n \"I think we\u0027ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n \"I -- told -- you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I -- told -- you.\"\n \"We\u0027ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\"\n \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\u0027t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"\n Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u0027t going to tell her that.\n \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n It wasn\u0027t going to be that simple. They hadn\u0027t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\n It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n \"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you\u0027ll get us thrown out.\"\n Peeves cackled.\n \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u0027ll get caughty.\"\n \"Not if you don\u0027t give us away, Peeves, please.\"\n \"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It\u0027s for your own good, you know.\"\n \"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\n \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\"\n Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.\n \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\u0027re done for! This is the end!\"\n They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\u0027s shouts.\n \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u0027s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\"\n The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\n \"Say \u0027please.\u0027\"\n \"Don\u0027t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?\"\n \"Shan\u0027t say nothing if you don\u0027t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n \"All right -- please.\"\n \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u0027t say nothing if you didn\u0027t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\n \"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\u0027ll be okay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u0027s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What ?\"\n Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\u0027d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\n They weren\u0027t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u0027t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he\u0027d take Filch.\n They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\u0027t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\u0027t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n \"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n \"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\n It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\u0027d never speak again.\n \"What do they think they\u0027re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\n Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don\u0027t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\u0027t you see what it was standing on.\n \"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\u0027t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"\n \"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u0027s obviously guarding something.\"\n She stood up, glaring at them.\n \"I hope you\u0027re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027m going to bed.\"\n Ron stared after her, his mouth open.\n \"No, we don\u0027t mind,\" he said. \"You\u0027d think we dragged her along, wouldn\u0027t you.\n But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\n It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-9.html","bookId":1563,"book":{"id":1563,"title":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (Harry Potter #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u0027s Stone (Harry Potter #1) \n \n Just before the start of the novel, Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry\u0027s parents but mysteriously vanished after trying to kill Harry.
