{"id":106487,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Text of a letter from Avasa Dani to Sanat Ji Mani, written and received at Alexandria in June, 1401.\n No, Sanat Ji Mani, I cannot see that any good would be served by our meeting again. I know your invitation was kindly meant, and I have received it in that spirit, but I am content with the life I have now, a life I know you have given me, and I do not believe that there is any purpose to our resuming our friendship now that I am of your blood.\n It is gratifying to know your business with Rustam Iniattir and his House has done so well. I am pleased that you were able to gain something after your great losses at Delhi, and I thank you for the funds that success has brought to me. It is most generous of you to set aside five percent of your profits for my use. In time I hope I will have no need of them, but in case that does not happen as soon as I anticipate, let me express my gratitude not only for the money, but your understanding.\n I was saddened to learn of your hardships after the destruction of Delhi; but, as you said yourself, many suffered far worse than you did, and you returned to this place to a thriving business, which is more than most were able to do. From what little Rogerian has told me, you have endured many adversities in the past and may do so again, so while I am distressed to know that you had difficulties, you are doubtless capable of dealing with all that is demanded of you. I will take you as an admirable example in times to come.\n As long as the Blood-Bond tells me you still live, I will not fret on your behalf. Knowing that you are about the world is a comfort in itself, but as my life as a breathing woman is over, so is all but the Bond with you. While I know I owe you more than I will ever be able to repay, if you would continue your kindness to me, leave me alone. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14/page-36.html","bookId":2500,"book":{"id":2500,"title":"A Feast In Exile (Saint-Germain #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Feast In Exile (Saint-Germain #14) \n A Feast in Exile draws readers back to the time when the Mongol hordes of Timur (known in the West as Tamerlane) swept across fourteenth-century India and Asia. Delhi\u0027s civilized veneer crumbles along with its walls. Foreigners, which the vampire Saint-Germain-here called Sanat Ji Mani-surely is, lose their positions, homes, wealth, and sometimes their lives, if they cannot escape the falling city. \n Before he can flee Delhi, Sanat Ji Mani must ensure the safety of Avasa Dani, his beautiful ward, who has been abandoned by her husband. Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s love has awakened Avasa Dani\u0027s every sense; even she will become a vampire upon her death, but she finds no terror in this fate. \n Avasa Dani and Rojire, Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s servant, successfully make their way out of Delhi, but Sanat Ji Mani himself is trapped. His life is bought by his skills with medicine, but, at Timur\u0027s command, he must travel-by day, and exposed to the sun-with the conqueror\u0027s army. Crippled and unable to escape, he knows that his vampire nature will soon be revealed, and then... \n Avasa Dani, with a worried Rojire at her side, considers her options as a woman without a visible male protector in a land and time ruled by men. While one of Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s allies searches desperately for the missing vampire, Saint-Germain and a young acrobat, with whom he has escaped from Timur\u0027s forces, make their slow and painful way to freedom. The journey changes them both forever.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:56:49 PM"}}
