{"id":106462,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"They will be here in a day or two,\" Zal Iniattir said to Sanat Ji Mani as they walked in the confines of the courtyard garden at the rear of the Iniattir house. \"The caravan-leader who arrived today saw the dust of their travel.\"\\n\\n \"Is he sure that is what he saw?\" Sanat Ji Mani asked, and went on, \"I do not doubt you, or him, but dust in the air is not so remarkable-\"\\n\\n Zal Iniattir laughed angrily once. \"This dust was; it covered half the sky, and he could hear the soldiers shouting. Roshin is not one to make fanciful tales on such matters. He knows Darkness is abroad in the land.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps he knows it too well, and sees it where it is not,\" Sanat Ji Mani suggested, all the while keenly aware that if Timur-i did not come this month, he would arrive the next; he knew also that he had waited too long to leave.\\n\\n \"Not he. Perhaps another might, but not Roshin. He is a steady man, pragmatic.\" Zal Iniattir looked over his shoulder. \"I think it is time I took my family out of here, at least until the rains come again. I will be ready to leave in two days.\"\\n\\n \"It is probably a wise thing to do,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, chiding himself silently for his own laxness. \"Have you decided where you will go yet?\"\\n\\n \"I have spoken with Askari Daitya, who is prepared to lead another caravan to Sirpur, if he can accommodate me and my family in the doing of it. I have said I will pay him twice his usual fee for escorting us to Sirpur. My cousin Azizi Iniattir is there and he will receive us, I am sure of it.\" Zal Iniattir shook his head vehemently, as if in response to a challenge. \"I am not betraying my vow to my uncle. He did not ask that we remain as sacrifices.\"\\n\\n \"No, he did not,\" Sanat Ji Mani agreed. \"And Sirpur is a long way from Delhi.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. It is,\" Zal Iniattir admitted. \"I would like to believe that Rustam Iniattir would approve of my decision. Askari Daitya does.\"\\n\\n \"That is something worthwhile,\" Sanat Ji Mani agreed.\\n\\n \"I mention this because you may want to come with us,\" Zal Iniattir went on. \"I have spoken to Askari Daitya about including you, and one or two servants, and he has said, so long as you provide your own animals and provisions, he would accept your company for the same price as I am paying him.\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani touched his hands together and bowed. \"I am touched by your kindness, Zal Iniattir, and I will consider your offer. I have already made a petition to the magistrates to leave Delhi after the Winter Solstice, but I may be able to persuade them to allow me to go before that, if I provide incentive enough.\"\\n\\n \"In gold?\" Zal Iniattir asked.\\n\\n \"Or jewels,\" said Sanat Ji Mani.\\n\\n \"Yes, they might make such an allowance,\" said Zal Iniattir, \"if you paid them enough.\"\\n\\n \"So I think,\" Sanat Ji Mani agreed. \"They will expect a good sum for granting my request.\" He had already paid a hefty amount to file the petition, but he was willing to double it if he could secure the necessary permissions to leave in order to keep title on his property in Delhi and to protect the two servants still under his roof: Bohdil and Shudra. He was well-aware that if he departed without permission of the authorities, his lands, house, goods, stock, and servants would be seized by the Sultan\u0027s ministers in lieu of the taxes-some invented on the spot-he would have levied against him.\\n\\n \"It is a bargain, whatever they may ask,\" said Zal Iniattir with feeling. \"My uncle would advise you to make all arrangements as quickly as possible, I know. You have protected him: now let him protect you.\"\\n\\n \"You are very generous,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"And I am grateful to you. I will see what can be done with the magistrates.\"\\n\\n \"So many are leaving every day that I cannot think of any reason they should require you to remain,\" said Zal Iniattir, doing his best to be encouraging. \"You have never argued with them on any point they made before now. Why should you begin?\"\\n\\n \"They may not see it that way,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, a touch of irony in his voice.\\n\\n \"Why should they not?\" Zal Iniattir asked, and then answered his own question. \"Of course. You have paid them much money, and they would like more of it. You have given gold and supplies to the army, as well, and Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq wants as much as he can demand of you.\"\\n\\n \"It is something that touches you as well,\" said Sanat Ji Mani.\\n\\n \"So it does,\" Zal Iniattir said. \"That is why I am going day after tomorrow. Send me word by sunset tomorrow and I will make whatever arrangements you like.\" He bowed slightly. \"You have been most kind to us, and whatever your decision, the House of Iniattir is in your debt.\"\\n\\n \"Not by my reckoning,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, who was suspicious of gratitude, knowing how quickly it could turn to resentment.\\n\\n \"You say so, but my uncle has commanded me otherwise,\" said Zal Iniattir. \"I will not linger, for I have much to do. But tell me that you will be ready to leave and I will send my slaves to bring your chests and cases to the caravan.\"\\n\\n \"You are most kind,\" Sanat Ji Mani said, making a formal European bow. \"I will send you word as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n \"I will await it eagerly,\" Zal Iniattir said, and prepared to show his guest to the door.\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani paused to look about the garden one last time. \"It is very pleasant here.\"\\n\\n \"That it is,\" Zal Iniattir said. \"I will miss it.\"\\n\\n \"I can see why,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. He had reached the gate. \"Whether or not I go with you, I wish you a safe journey and a prosperous return.\"\\n\\n \"I will hope there is something to return to,\" said Zal Iniattir. \"May your gods protect you.\" The two bowed again, and Zal Iniattir let Sanat Ji Mani out of the gate.\\n\\n There were many people in the streets, most of them in a hurry, all of them evincing the kind of restlessness that was not far from panic. Even a few women were about, none of them Islamic, all trying to find a haven from dread and Timur-i.\\n\\n At his house, Sanat Ji Mani was met by Bohdil, who gave the most cursory of greetings before saying, \"The Sultan\u0027s deputies have taken all but two of your horses. They say it is for the army, and they may take one more.\" He was clearly upset by this development, but did his best not to make a greater issue than necessary of the event. \"They are taking horses from everyone, and asses. They want mounts for as many of their soldiers as possible.\"\\n\\n \"If they are facing Timur-i, I can see why they might,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"Did they take tack as well?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Bridles and saddles and pads and halters,\" said Bohdil. \"one of the men wanted to take your forge, but could not find a way to lift it. They may send others to claim it.\"\\n\\n \"They must be more desperate than I thought,\" said Sanat Ji Mani quietly. He pondered briefly, then looked up. \"Have you somewhere to go beyond Delhi-to the east, not the west?\"\\n\\n Bohdil looked at his master uneasily. \"Yes. I have cousins in Kol.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"I want you and Shudra to take the two remaining horses and leave at once. Go to Kol and wait there until I send word for you to return.\"\\n\\n \"You cannot want this,\" said Bohdil, aghast.\\n\\n \"In general, no, I do not. But Timur-i has made what I want impossible, so I must do what I can to minimize his damage.\" Sanat Ji Mani saw the dismay in Bohdil\u0027s eyes, and went on, \"I will provide you with money, and one or two jewels, so you need not be beggars. But hurry. I want you away from here as soon as you can make yourself ready. Gather your belongings. I will saddle the horses for you, and then fetch your coins.\" He gestured, sending Bohdil off before he started toward the stable. Once there, he lit four of the oil-lamps and began to groom the two horses left in the stalls. He worked quickly, not bothering with combing the manes or tails of the two mares. He saddled and bridled the horses and led them into the stable yard to the trough so they could drink. He patted the neck of the nearer mare, saying, \"You will do better away from here, my girl.\"\\n\\n Bohdil was the first to return, an improvised pack slung over his shoulder. \"I have told Shudra, but he is afraid-he does not know how to ride a horse.\"\\n\\n \"He will learn,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, a determined note in his light reply. \"Leave by the southern River Gate. No one will stop you there if you give them a bit of silver.\"\\n\\n \"Must it be now?\" Bohdil asked as he prepared to mount the taller mare.\\n\\n \"I fear it should have been yesterday.\" Sanat Ji Mani sighed once. \"I should have been more circumspect.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think Timur-i is really going to attack Delhi? How can he hope to succeed?\" Bohdil leaned down to set his stirrups.\\n\\n \"He has not failed before,\" Sanat Ji Mani pointed out, then glanced up as Shudra came out of the house, an untidy bundle clasped in his arms, his clothing in disarray; he muttered what seemed to be an apology to Sanat Ji Mani, who went on, \"I am sorry to have to require this of you. I do not want to have to answer to your families for your lives.\"\\n\\n Shudra stared at the grey mare waiting for him, and blanched. \"I cannot,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Bohdil will help you,\" Sanat Ji Mani said as if he had not heard.\\n\\n \"But I have never ridden anything but a donkey,\" he protested.\\n\\n \"This mare is well-trained. Let Bodhil take the lead and she will follow after. You have nothing to fear from the horse,\" Sanat Ji Mani said pointedly. \"Remaining here can be dangerous.\" He held out his joined hands to assist the assistant cook to mount. \"Go as fast as you can, as far as you can tonight. It is almost the dark of the year, and you have many hours of night to hide your escape.\"\\n\\n Bohdil made an impatient sound with his tongue. \"Come, Shudra. Hurry. They may shut the gates at any time, and we will be stuck here.\" He nodded to Sanat Ji Mani. \"You said you would provide us money ... ?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I will be back in a moment,\" Sanat Ji Mani said, going into the house and directly to his study. There he removed a dozen gold and half-a-dozen silver coins from his chest, then took them out to the two servants in the courtyard. \"Here. This is your wages to this day, and some extra. It will pay for food and lodging and allow you some left over when you reach Kol.\"\\n\\n \"Burn incense to Ganesh, my master,\" said Bohdil. \"And to Vishnu.\" He swung his horse around to face the gate. \"You have been kind to us. May it ease your karma.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, opening the gates for them. \"Leave quickly.\"\\n\\n Bohdil clapped his heels to the mare\u0027s side and she moved forward, the second mare followed after, Shudra clinging to the saddle. \"Until fate brings us together again,\" he called back over his shoulder.\\n\\n As soon as the two were outside, Sanat Ji Mani closed the gate and barred it, then went back into his empty house, climbing to the laboratory on the top floor, where he busied himself making several vials of his sovereign remedy from the two large jars of moldy bread. He was still keeping watch over the athanor when the sun rose, made glarey by thin, high clouds. He told himself that when his final batch of sovereign remedy was finished, he would break up the athanor and make his way to the house of Zal Iniattir, to join his family in their departure to the south-south-east. It was the most sensible thing to do, given that Timur-i was approaching. He estimated he would complete his work by mid-day; he would forgo the pleasure of a long nap: he would sleep when he was well beyond the walls of Delhi. He was preparing a saddle-bag for his jars and vials when a sharp pounding on the door caught his attention; having no one to answer the summons but himself, he made his way down to the front door, where he found six armed men from the palace waiting.\\n\\n \"You are Sanat Ji Mani?\" asked the leader of the man without the courtesy of a greeting.\\n\\n \"I am,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, wondering what new tax was about to be imposed upon him.\\n\\n \"You are the wealthy foreigner who heals?\" the leader persisted.\\n\\n \"I suppose I am,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, sounding wary and tired at once. \"I am foreign, I do possess some wealth, and I have some skill with medicinal materials, but I am not a physician in the sense of those men trained in this city.\" He did not add that he had received his initial instruction in treating the injured and ill at the Temple of Imhotep in the Egypt of the Pharaohs.\\n\\n \"You have healed the sick and wounded,\" said the leader. \"You have treated those with fever and they have recovered.\"\\n\\n \"Upon occasion,\" Sanat Ji Mani answered steadily, which was enough for the leader of the soldiers.\\n\\n \"We serve Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq: he wishes you to attend him at once.\" This was an order with only the faintest pretext of being an invitation. \"You are to bring your medicaments and tools, and whatever other supplies you may need.\"\\n\\n \"I have work on-going. I will put myself at his disposal shortly after noon,\" said Sanat Ji Mani as politely as he could.\\n\\n \"You are to come with us-now.\" The leader laid his hand on the hilt of his shimtare. \"We are told to bring you, and your things.\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani took a long breath. \"May I have a few moments to keep my work from spoiling? I will need to go into my house to fetch my supplies, in any case. It will not take me very long to do the things that will let me salvage my work.\"\\n\\n The leader considered this. \"I will come with you. If you try to escape or to barricade yourself inside your house, I will hack off your hands in punishment.\"\\n\\n \"I will try to do as you wish,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, feeling the desperation of these men. \"You have my Word on it. You do not have to compel me with threats.\" The thought of having to live so horribly maimed was enough to make him proceed warily; he wanted to provide the soldiers with no excuse to harm him.\\n\\n \"Your word may satisfy some, but I will watch you,\" said the leader, signaling the others to remain where they were. \"This is a most important errand, and we may not fail.\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani went up the flights of stairs with a swiftness that had the leader panting with effort; he reached his top floor several steps ahead of the soldier, and used that minuscule time to conceal most of his apparatus. Then he grabbed the saddle-bags and thrust the waiting vials and jars into them just as the leader of the soldiers heaved himself into the room. \"I am almost ready,\" he said, regretting now that he had not dismantled the athanor earlier that morning.\\n\\n \"Well, make haste,\" said the soldier gruffly, having to say something to maintain his authority.\\n\\n \"I am doing my utmost,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, and pointed to a small case of medical instruments. \"If you will carry that for me, I would be grateful.\" He could have carried it himself, but that would draw attention to his strength and could lead to speculation that would not be welcome.\\n\\n \"As you wish,\" said the soldier, taking the case into his hands and holding it gingerly. \"Is it fragile?\"\\n\\n \"Not particularly, but carry it charily; the instruments are valuable.\" And virtually irreplacable, he added to himself. He took a last look around the top room of his house, wondering vaguely if he would ever see it again. Over the centuries he had left so many houses behind, he reminded himself, he should be used to such loss by now.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" the soldier asked.\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani gave a single shake of his head. \"Nothing.\" He went to the stairs. \"Come. It is time to be off.\"\\n\\n \"Very well,\" said the soldier, descending the stairs behind Sanat Ji Mani, the small chest held out ahead of him like an offering. \"I am told to bring you to Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq, who is on the walls of the city.\"\\n\\n \"For what purpose?\" Sanat Ji Mani asked, wanting to know why he had been summoned in this abrupt way.\\n\\n The leader of the soldiers interpreted the inquiry another way: \"Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq is watching the approach of Timur-i\u0027s army. They are to the west-north-west of the city, and coming quickly.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, understanding at last. \"Yes. He had to come, did he not.\"\\n\\n \"He is here,\" said the leader as they reached the ground floor again. \"You will put yourself at the disposal of Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq. He will decide what you are to do.\"\\n\\n \"He is going to fight?\" Sanat Ji Mani went to the gate where the other soldiers waited.\\n\\n \"As Allah Wills,\" said the leader of the soldiers.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Sanat Ji Mani agreed, stepping outside and pulling his gate closed. \"Very well. Tell me where I am to go.\"\\n\\n \"We will escort you,\" said the leader, and motioned his men to form an escort around Sanat Ji Mani, marching him out of the Foreigners\u0027 Quarter and off toward the north-western battlements of Delhi. The soldiers cleared a way through the streets where restless excitement had reached a dangerous pitch, for there were now hundreds trying to escape from the city, all of them trying to reach the eastern gates, away from Timur-i\u0027s advancing hosts.\\n\\n \"Come this way,\" the leader shouted to Sanat Ji Mani as they reached the entrance to the marshaling yard where men, horses, and elephants were crowded together in an attempt to face the brunt of the attack. The leader guided Sanat Ji Mani along the edge of the marshaling yard, and pointed to the base of a tower that gave access to the battlements. \"The archers are forming their companies at the next gate,\" the leader said, as he and his men urged Sanat Ji Mani up the stairs and into the tower.\\n\\n \"You cannot come any farther,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi, resplendent in his silks and mail. He blocked the way to the battlements.\\n\\n \"Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq sent for this man,\" said the leader of soldiers. \"We were ordered to present him.\"\\n\\n \"I command this quadrant of the city,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi. \"I say you must turn back.\"\\n\\n The leader of the soldiers signaled to his men. \"You may command this quadrant, but we serve the Sultan and his deputies. You must permit us to pass or answer to Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq for our failure to comply with the orders we have been given.\"\\n\\n Kanwar Gotanipi stood very straight. \"You have no authority to do this.\"\\n\\n \"I have more than you do,\" said the leader of the soldiers. \"Stand aside, you Brahman fool, and let us get on with our work.\"\\n\\n There was a long moment of stillness, then Kanwar Gotanipi stepped aside with an elaborate shrug. \"If you wish to be reprimanded, what is it to me?\"\\n\\n The leader of the soldiers did not dignify this petulant remark with any comment; he nodded to his men and Sanat Ji Mani as they went out onto the battlements and into the brisk wind, where Firuz Ihbal bin Tughluq waited, surrounded by men in various kinds of armor, all of whom were peering out into the middle distance where a vast cloud of dust rolled into the shining sky.\\n\\n \"How long do you think it will take them to reach the city?\" Firuz Ihbal asked without turning.\\n\\n \"The mounted troops will be here soon, I should think,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"The rest of the army will take a little longer-perhaps until tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"So fast,\" said Firuz Ihbal. \"But I suppose you are right.\" He sighed and gave his attention to Sanat Ji Mani. \"We must be ready to meet them, to show them the futility of attacking us.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt you can persuade them of that,\" said Sanat Ji Mani drily. \"They must think you have something worthwhile, or they would not be here.\"\\n\\n \"So you say,\" Firuz Ihbal declared. \"But they also worship Allah, and they will honor our faith.\"\\n\\n \"They have not done so for other followers of Islam,\" Sanat Ji Mani said quietly. \"Why should they make an exception for you?\"\\n\\n \"We are a great city, and we have done nothing to deserve slaughter.\" Firuz Ihbal stared at Sanat Ji Mani for some time. \"In any case, there will be casualties, and I will require your help in treating wounded men.\" He clapped his hands. \"I will order the slaves to make a place for you to do your work. When the men have all been tended to, you may take your treasure and go without any hindrance. I swear it as if my hand were on the Qran.\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani was keenly aware that such vows meant nothing unless the man\u0027s hand actually was on the Qran, but knew this was not the time to challenge Firuz Ihbal. \"I would not want to see men suffer if I could do anything to prevent it, no matter what cause they fought for,\" he said, his manner self-effacing enough to satisfy Firuz Ihbal. \"You need not offer me a bribe to do what must be done.\"\\n\\n \"Very well,\" said Firuz Ihbal. \"I will make you no promises then.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" Sanat Ji Mani said, not entirely sincerely. \"You may select a place for me to work without fear that I will do anything to harm you or your men.\"\\n\\n Firuz Ihbal looked about curiously. \"I do not think we will lose many men. The men of Timur-i are fierce, but they are not as many as we are.\" He pulled at his moustaches. \"You are aware, are you not, that this is a battle that we must win, for the Sultan.\"\\n\\n \"A pity that he is not here,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"The people would not be leaving in such great numbers if the Sultan had remained here.\"\\n\\n \"It must seem so to a foreigner. You are planning to leave, are you not?\" Firuz Ihbal spoke sharply, not quite accusing Sanat Ji Mani.\\n\\n \"You have my petition,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. \"You were considering what tax I would have to pay to leave sooner than I requested.\"\\n\\n \"The tax will be forgiven you, foreigner, when you have done your service here.\" Firuz Ihbal spat copiously. \"There is grit in the wind.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. And there will be more than grit, bye and bye,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, more to himself than to anyone else.\\n\\n \"You will do the Sultan this service,\" Firuz Ihbal commanded, and pointed toward Kanwar Gotanipi. \"See that he is given the facilities we spoke of. And find that worm Josha Dar: I have work for him.\"\\n\\n Kanwar Gotanipi took a step back, his face gone blank with fear. \"Josha Dar left this morning, Exalted Lord,\" he said. \"He told me he was acting under your orders.\"\\n\\n Firuz Ihbal glowered at Kanwar Gotanipi. \"And you believed him-Josha Dar?\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani looked from one man to the other, trying to read the extent of the shock each had sustained; he could see that the two men were disturbed by this news but for different reasons.\\n\\n \"He has done many things for you, Exalted Lord,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi.\\n\\n \"He has been useful,\" Firuz Ihbal conceded, his manner less imposing. \"You have committed a minor fault. You have nothing to fear from me.\"\\n\\n \"I will not fear you, Exalted Lord,\" Kanwar Gotanipi said staunchly, but with hands clenched at his side.\\n\\n \"The Sultan will praise your service when this is done,\" Firuz Ihbal added in a tone suffused with weariness. \"You will not be held accountable for what that spy has done.\"\\n\\n Kanwar Gotanipi put his hands together and bowed. \"The Exalted Lord is gracious,\" he said. \"I will attend to this foreigner at once.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Firuz Ihbal, waving them both away. \"Send Iksander Mawan to me. I have work for him.\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi as he nodded Sanat Ji Mani in the direction of the stairs. \"You will descend ahead of me. You cannot run.\"\\n\\n \"I had not intended to try,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, entering the tower and making his way to the steps. \"I suppose you have much to do, readying for Timur-i.\"\\n\\n \"All Delhi does,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi. \"You are only one of many who must be prepared for what is coming.\"\\n\\n \"I saw the army marshaling,\" Sanat Ji Mani remarked as he started down the stairs. \"It is going to be a hard-fought engagement.\"\\n\\n \"As to that, I believe the Sultan\u0027s men have found a way to preserve the city, to keep the walls from being breached. It is a plan most carefully conceived. We have spent many hours in deep thought and long discussion, and I am sure the Sultan will have reason to rejoice.\" Kanwar Gotanipi kept Sanat Ji Mani moving as he spoke, using the handle of his short whip to urge the foreigner along.\\n\\n \"If that is the case, it is a shame that the Sultan will not be here to see it,\" Sanat Ji Mani said, his irony lost on Kanwar Gotanipi.\\n\\n \"We will meet them outside the walls, with all our archers and elephants and mounted men. Our numbers alone will drive them back, for although they are strong fighters, they are not as numerous or as well-armed as we. They will see this, and it will give them reason to consider, for they will know they will lose many men, coming against us. That is when we will sue for a reasonable peace, while we may preserve our city and our fortunes from all Timur-i\u0027s forces might do.\" Kanwar Gotanipi could not conceal his pride in this scheme. \"They may try to fight, but in the end, they will have to flee before our greater power.\"\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani strove to conceal his dismay. \"Why not fight from behind the walls, letting them protect you? Surely you know that Timur-i\u0027s greatest strength is in the open, where his mounted men can maneuver?\" He asked calmly enough but it was an effort to maintain his composure.\\n\\n \"Because Timur-i will not be discouraged except in the open. He has always attacked fortifications, and is not frightened by them. But he can be met by superior force in the open. He will try to drive our forces back inside the walls. We will not permit him to do that. We know how he uses his men, and what we must do to prevent his assault on our walls. If Delhi were not so well-armed and had such a huge army, your fears would be well-founded, but it is not right that so powerful an army as ours remain hidden behind the walls when a single act would show Timur-i that assault is futile. We have one hundred twenty war elephants as well as ten thousand cavalry and twenty thousand infantry and more than ten thousand archers on the walls-at least four times the men Timur-i is said to have. Our leaders know this from all the reports they have had.\" Kanwar Gotanipi made a victory salute. \"It would be better if the Sultan were here, yet we will prevail. It is essential that we prevail.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Sanat Ji Mani. They were at the base of the tower and he did not know where to go next so he waited for Kanwar Gotanipi to come to him. \"The wounded I am to treat-how are they to get to me? If you want me outside the walls, I might be overwhelmed by the battle and be of use to no one. If you keep me inside the walls, with your soldiers outside, how am I to treat them?\"\\n\\n \"We have slaves to carry them to you,\" said Kanwar Gotanipi as if it were an obvious solution. \"You will be inside the wall. Look across the marshaling yard and you will see an embrasure in the wall?\" He pointed. \"You will have tents put up for your use, and slaves assigned to assist you.\"\\n\\n Certain that he was facing disaster, Sanat Ji Mani said, \"I would prefer the help of old soldiers, not slaves. The work you want is bloody, and many slaves cannot accept the blood-old soldiers can. They know battle and will not shrink at what they see.\"\\n\\n Kanwar Gotanipi considered this request. \"You may have hit upon something important,\" he allowed. \"I will speak to Firuz Ihbal on your behalf, and perhaps he will agree with you.\"\\n\\n \"If you like, I will address him myself,\" said Sanat Ji Mani, thinking a bribe might secure the support he sought more quickly than a simple request.\\n\\n \"No. You must make your tents ready. They must be prepared before the army marches out of the gates. I will attend to it later; I will tell you what Firuz Ihbal has decided.\" Kanwar Gotanipi motioned Sanat Ji Mani to follow him, and began to make his way across the confusion on the marshaling ground.\\n\\n Sanat Ji Mani threaded his way behind Kanwar Gotanipi, his eyes shaded as the mid-day heat ate at him, presaging the catastrophe he was convinced would come.\\n\\n Text of a declaration posted and announced everywhere in Delhi by the deputies of the Sultan.\\n\\n To the people of Delhi, this is the law in this time of occupation, for it has pleased Allah to give the victory over us to Timur-i Lenkh and his men; Timur-i Lenkh, who is a faithful follower of the Prophet, has set his hand upon the sacred Qran and sworn that there will be no more killing here so long as his orders are obeyed in every particular, without question or resistance, and that should the people of Delhi traduce the vows of the Sultan\u0027s ministers and deputies, the soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh will at once begin both sacking and pillaging of Delhi: we enjoin you all to adhere to these conditions and to uphold the honor of the Sultan in sparing this city from the ruin Timur-i Lenkh has wrought elsewhere:\\n\\n All soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh are to be given access to every house and other buildings within the city without let or hindrance. They are to be allowed to seize anything that they wish, and no one is to deny them anything they may demand. Failure to comply with this order will result in everyone within the city not of immediate use to Timur-i Lenkh being put to the sword and the city destroyed.\\n\\n All soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh are to be fed and clothed to the limit of the household, without question and without any let or hindrance. Failure to comply with this order will result in the total destruction of the household refusing food and clothing to the soldiers.\\n\\n All soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh are to be allowed such access as they may wish to women and boys, and no complaint is to be made at any choice they may make, either by the head of the household or by the women or boys in question. Failure to provide that access will result in the immediate killing of all the household where the soldiers have been denied such access.\\n\\n All soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh are to be provided slaves to aid them in their plundering, to act as bearers and to serve the soldiers in any way they see fit. All households are to make their slaves available to the soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh. No slaves are to be held back or denied the soldiers, who are to be given full and total rights to all slaves within Delhi, of any nature whatsoever. Failure to comply with this order will result in the destruction of the household refusing its slaves to the soldiers.\\n\\n All soldiers of Timur-i Lenkh are to be allowed to enter any and all temples of Delhi and remove any and all objects that they may choose to remove. No one is to protest their selections, nor are any priests to attempt to keep them from entering the temples. Failure to comply with this order will result in the slaughter of the people and the destruction of the city of Delhi.\\n\\n All persons of Delhi harboring the sick, the mad, the ancient, or the deformed must bring those persons to the magistrates and present them to the judgment of the officers of Timur-i Lenkh. No persons are to be held back for any reason, nor are the infirm to be exempted from this order.

Delhi\u0027s civilized veneer crumbles along with its walls. Foreigners, which the vampire Saint-Germain-here called Sanat Ji Mani-surely is, lose their positions, homes, wealth, and sometimes their lives, if they cannot escape the falling city. \\n Before he can flee Delhi, Sanat Ji Mani must ensure the safety of Avasa Dani, his beautiful ward, who has been abandoned by her husband. Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s love has awakened Avasa Dani\u0027s every sense; even she will become a vampire upon her death, but she finds no terror in this fate. \\n Avasa Dani and Rojire, Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s servant, successfully make their way out of Delhi, but Sanat Ji Mani himself is trapped. His life is bought by his skills with medicine, but, at Timur\u0027s command, he must travel-by day, and exposed to the sun-with the conqueror\u0027s army. Crippled and unable to escape, he knows that his vampire nature will soon be revealed, and then... \\n Avasa Dani, with a worried Rojire at her side, considers her options as a woman without a visible male protector in a land and time ruled by men. While one of Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s allies searches desperately for the missing vampire, Saint-Germain and a young acrobat, with whom he has escaped from Timur\u0027s forces, make their slow and painful way to freedom. The journey changes them both forever.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:56:49 PM"}}
