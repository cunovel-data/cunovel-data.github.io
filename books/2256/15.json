{"id":86526,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"“Where did you get a spreader bar?” Even more, he wanted to know, “What are you going to do?” On his knees on the bed, Zack took the chain in his hands and moved toward the headboard, forcing Gabe to his back, pulling his legs and arms off the bed. The farther he pushed the chain, the more Gabe struggled, uselessly. Zack didn’t quit until a link in the chain slipped over a hook Gabe had never seen before, at the top of the tall headboard,leaving Gabe’s ass up in the air. He could roll a little from side to side, but that was about it.. Zack took pillows and wedged them under him and at his sides to prevent him from even rolling. “I’m about to remind you who’s the alpha.” Zack answered the second question. He drew back his hand and gaveGabe’s butt cheeks a hard spank. “Ow! No, stop!” Gabe yelled, wiggling his ass. “I’ll kill you when I get out of this!” Zack got off the bed and returned to the closet, drawing out a short flogger, made of soft suede. Zack returned and dragged the strands slowly across the backs ofGabe’s thighs and the cleft between his spread legs, dangling the soft ends in feather light touches on his throbbing cock.“Want to apologize, baby? Tell me how very much you want to wear my collar?” “You’re not really going to beat me with that, are you?” “It’s designed to give more heat than pain. I’m going to heat up that bottom of yours until you beg me to put the collar on you.” “Never!” Gabe spat back at him. Zack smiled down at him.“Still not too late to stop it, baby. Say the three little words I want to hear—please collar me—and it all stops. “Fuck you!” Gabe spat at him and wiggled violently, trying to get out, knowing damned good and well he couldn’t. He wasn’t too sure he hadn’t broken off more than he could chew. Zack watched him until his head fell back on the pillow, defeated, before he raised the flogger and gave him two licks on each butt cheek. Gabe was furious, but he had to admit, the flogger didn’t really hurt. Like Zack said, it warmed his bottom for him pretty good, but there was no real pain. The pain came from the humiliation and thought of giving in to a battle of wills, and Zack had to know it. “You never gave me a safe word! You’re supposed to give me a safe word, and if I say it, everything stops!” “Hmm…you do seem to know a lot about this. That’s a conversation we need to have later on. No, baby, you don’t need a safe word. I’m not going to really hurt you, and you know it. And you already know the three little words that will make it all stop.” Gabe made a loud, frustrated noise.“I hate you! And I hate this!” “Little liar. Bad boys lie, baby. You love every minute of this, and you know it. Wouldn’t it be better to give in like a good little boy?” “Oooohh! When I get out of this, I’ll…I’ll…” “Shhh, baby. Time foranother reminder.” The flogger came down again and again, and his ass was beginning to get uncomfortable. Gabe threw back his head and was horrified to feel tears streaming down his face, but he couldn’t help it. He could hear the whimpers coming from his throat. His back, ankles and wrists were beginning to ache. He was also so fucking hot he thought he might come all over himself. Zack stopped and leaned forward to put his face right over Gabe’s. “Got anything you want to say, honey?” Gabe bit his lips and turned his head. Zack sighed and laid into him again, until it was actually getting pretty painful. Gabe knew his ass would be sore for a week. Zack stopped after a few more strokes and by then, Gabe was breathing in short hitches. “Baby? Sure you don’twant to ask Daddy something?” Gritting his teeth, his throat catching on a sob, Gabe forced out the words.“Would you…would you please ccollar me?” Zack unhooked the chain, bringing Gabe’s ass down on the bed. He opened the cuffs on first one side and then the other, freeing his wrists and allowing him to ease the strain on his back. Releasing his ankles and removing the spreader bar, he said,“Sit up, baby.” Gingerly, his ass burning, Gabe sat up. Zack put the black leather collar around his neck and fastened it on.“You only take this off to bathe and then right back on. Understood?” Gabe nodded, too angry and frustrated to speak, and so horny he was about to explode. The collar was heavy and warm on his neck. “When you learn to be a good boy, you can have the gold one. Say thank you, sir.” “Thank you, sir,” Gabe mumbled. Zack smiled down at him.“Don’t you look pretty wearing my collar and nothing else? I think from now on in our morning sessions, you’ll be wearing only your collar. Then afterward, I’ll let you suck my dick.” Gabe glanced up at him, barely controlling himself. “Can I get up, please?” “Not a chance. I’ve never been thishard in my life.” He grabbed him around the hips, picked him up and flipped him over. Zack pushed the pillows up under his stomach, bent down, and kissed his reddened ass.“Your little ass looks perfect this way, baby.” He rubbed his hands over the tender flesh.“So beautifully spanked.” He kissed each of his butt cheeks and trailed the kisses over to his rim. He lavished attention on it with his tongue until Gabe squirmed and panted.Gabe’s cock was rock hard too. Zack took hold of it gently, sliding his hand in an up and down motion, moving his mouth to the backside of Gabe’s balls, which he thoroughly licked and teased with his tongue. He lay over Gabe’s back and put his tongue in his ear before whispering to him. “Do you want this, baby?” Gabe hesitated for only a few seconds before he spoke, his voice ragged with need.“Yes, I want it, dammit.” Zack couldn’t keep the smile off his face.“Then ask me to fuck you, baby.Don’t forget to call me sir.” Gabe groaned.“Sir, will you please fuck me?” “With pleasure, darlin’.” Gabe had wanted to say no. He really had. Every brain cell he had was screaming at him to tell Zack to go fuck himself. But all those other pesky tingles tormenting his cock and his balls— even his damn toes curled at the idea—came from the fact that Zack made him beg to wear the damn collar. They were cheering him on. What a fucking turn-on. Zackleft Gabe’s balls and rim and headed up toward his mouth, making him turn his head so he could nip at Gabe’s bottom lip. His tongue traced the crease in his mouth until it fell open. He thrust his tongue—his goddamned, magical, wicked tongue—inside his mouth and swept over the inside until he was needy and sweating. Zack turned his attention back to his ass, and Gabe’s ass rose in the air of its own accord and thrust itself back at him. Zack kissed around the rim again before he put a well slicked finger up his ass and crooked his finger, searching for the spot he knew would drive Gabe crazy with need. He found it and had Gabe writhing under him in seconds, grinding out his name through gritted teeth. “What’s that, baby? Do you like that?” “God, Zack! Please!” “Please what, honey?Do this?” He swept his finger over the spot again, and Gabe’s hips bucked uncontrollably.He was about to go, and he couldn’t stop it. Zack’s hand slid around to his cock and squeezed the base with his forefinger and thumb until Gabe could breathe again. “No, not yet. Settle down, baby.” Gabe thought if he didn’t stick his cock in him quickly, he was going to die from spontaneous combustion. How in the hell would that look to the coroner?“Zack,” he groaned. “Please do something!” “I will, darlin’. All in good time.” He bent over and licked his ass from his balls to the top of his crease. Gabe screamed, and Zack tightened his grip on his cock.“No more backtalk, okay? No more tight pants wiggling around in front of the other wolves either. No more drinking or dancing on tables.This is my little ass, and I won’t have you flaunting it around.” He rolled Gabe over to his side and put his mouth over the tip of his cock and sucked it hard. “Say,‘Yes, Zack.’” “Sweet baby Jesus!” “Say, ‘Yes, Zack,’ or I’ll suck your brains out through your cock.” “Dammit! Yes, Zack!” Zack rolled him back over and spread more lube inside his ass, raking his sinful fingers over his prostate again. When Gabethought he’d pass out from wanting him, Zack thrust his big cock up Gabe’s ass and pounded him hard. After only three of his thrusts, Gabe spurted all over the mattress, spurted until he was bone dry, but he couldn’t stop shuddering. Zack pounded a few more times and then stiffened as his orgasm overtook him, grinding into Gabe and burying himself deep inside. He collapsed on top of him, way too heavy, pushingGabe’s face down into the mattress, but it didn’t matter at the moment. Gabe could die happy,secure in the knowledge he’d been well and truly fucked to within an inch of his life. Zack rolled off him and pulled his body up close, throwinghis leg over Gabe’s thighs and began snoring in seconds. Gabe lay on his stomach for about a minute, sweaty and sticky with his own cum under him and Zack’s cum leaking out his ass. He panted hard to catch his breath, but he felt pretty damn good. He turned over, got up stiffly and went into the bathroom to clean himself up and even brought a warm cloth out and took care of Zack. Zack opened one eye as he worked on him and mumbled something which Gabe took for a thanks. He crawled back in bed and cuddled up close to Zack, who opened his arms and pulled him in tightly, settling his dick in the crease ofGabe’s ass. Gabe touched the collar around his throat.He’d already decided to wear the gold one, and it didn’t really matter about the leather one. Still he hadn’t like the earn it remark, and he’d make Zack pay for it a bit. He’d wanted to play with Zack a little though he’d almost got more than he’d bargained for with the spreader bar, cuffs, and a flogger. Of course he still really wanted the gold collar, because he liked jewelry, damn it, and Zack knew that very well. No matter—he’d get it soon. He’d make sure of it. In the meantime, the weight of the leather collar made him feel safe and protected. He snuggled his ass further back against Zack and heard him whimper a little in his sleep. The collar was definitely a mark of ownership. The question was who owned whom?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gabe-s-alpha-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-4/page-15.html","bookId":2256,"book":{"id":2256,"title":"Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4)","description":"Storyline: Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4) Gabe is a typical young college student until the night he and his mother are attacked by a beast who kills his mother and leaves Gabe for dead.
