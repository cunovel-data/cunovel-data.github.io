Quick, give me some morebefore tonight!” “Gabe, be very sure. I already fed you a little to calm you down when I brought you here. As I said, I’m notsure it’s enough. Giving you my blood affects me as well, and I want you so much, I wouldn’t be able to control myself. The bloodmatch is too strong with you. There are other wolves here who could feed you, but we’d have to lock you up until we’re certain a simple feeding is enough to stop the shifting.” “No!” Gabe said quickly, surprising Zack.“I want your blood. I tasted it already, and I liked it. As for the mating thing, you’re not exactly hard to look at. I can do this.I’d rather be with you than anybody else, I guess, and I don’t want to go through that even once more.” Zack smiled a slow, sexy smile at him.“You guess, huh? Baby, I don’t think you realize the seriousness of what I’m telling you. Once we mate, you’ll belong to me forever, and I would settle for nothing less with you. Wolves mate for life.You’ll move in here and live with me. I’ll take care of you,and you’ll join our clan.” The amount of longing in Gabe’s eyes surprised Zack. He remembered how young Gabe was and how he’d been on his own for a long time. Gabe shrugged and said softly, “Okay, sounds good. Might be nice for a change to belong somewhere for a change.To be with others who are like me.” Zack smiled down at him.“Well, I’m not going to stand here and talk you out of it. If you think you’re sure?” Gabe nodded confidently.“Let’s do it!” “When do you want to start?” “Now!” Gabe shucked off his clothes as quickly as he’d put them on a few minutes before and soon stood deliciously naked in front of Zack.“Well, c’mon, babe, let’s do this.” He patted the bed beside him. Zack smiled indulgently as he stood, pulled off his shirt and unbuttoned his jeans.“Okay, babe, we’ll do this as you say. Remember, once you become my mate, it’s for life. I wish you had more time to make a proper decisionand didn’t feel rushed. I don’t know if I could let you go, though.” He took a deep breath and took Gabe’s hand. “One more thing. No more other men for you after this—ever.” “Okay.” He grinned.“You look like you might be more than enough for me. As far as being sure, it’s not like I have much of a life anyway with this werewolf thing hanging over me.” “Wolf blood alone may be enough to prevent it, Gabe. You can feed from another wolf.” Zack had to force himself to say the words, and in reality he had no idea what he would do if Gabe agreed. The idea of his matewith another wolf made his stomach clench. Damn it, he’d kill them both.“We can wait and test it tonight, see if stops you from shifting.” “No, I’m positive. You attract me a lot, and damn, do you use some kind of sweet cologne or something? You smell so damn good.” Filled with overwhelming relief, Zack pulled him into his arms. He still wore his boxers, and heenjoyed Gabe’s expression of lustful delight as he rubbed against the large bulge in front of them.“You smell good to me too, Gabe. Irresistible, in fact. It’s the mating scent. My blood sings to yours and yours to mine.” “I hope you like to top, ’cause I want some of that.” His hand slipped between them almost reverently touchingZack’s large bulge. “I’m more of a bottom man, myself.” “Oh, I’ll top you, as you say,sweetheart.” He lifted Gabe by the ass and held him effortlessly.Gabe’s legs wrapped around his waist, Zack’s bulge nudgingGabe’s hole. Gabe let his head fall back and wiggled, trying to work the head through the slit of Zack’s boxers. “Slow down. There are other rules you’ll have to follow. No more drinking or smoking and abusing your body.You’ll live with me, and I warn you,I’m jealous.” “Yeah, well thatgoes both ways, babe.” Gabe dropped his head to nibble at Zack’s ear and whispered.“Hey, are you going to fuck me or talk me to death?” Zack growled at him and threw him down on his back on the bed. He crossed over to the side table and pulled out a tube of lube.“Turn over and let me prepare you.” “With pleasure,” Gabe said, twisting around and propped himself up on his hands and knees, putting his ass in the air provocatively. He looked over his shoulder to see if Zack was paying attention. Zack popped his ass playfully.“Be still, whelp. I’m getting you ready.” “I’m ready, babe. I’m not a virgin. Just smear a little lube on and let’s get this show on the road. Take off those shorts and let me inspect themerchandise.” Zack slapped his butt again, and Gabe laughed.“Oh,baby!” “I’m glad you like a spanking.I have a feeling you’ll be getting a lot of them in the months to come.” “Promises, promises. I’ll give you some too, honey. All you got to do is ask.” Zack smiled and shook his head. He opened the lube and squirted out a good glob of it in his hand. “You won’t need much. I told you it’s not my first time.” “Oh, but I will.” Zack turned to face himand pushing his boxers down, giving Gabe his first look at a wolf’s penis.Gabe’s eyebrows flew almost to his hairline, and he fell down on the bed to twist around and look at Zack more closely.“Whoa, baby, you’re hung like a horse, and what the hell is that?” Zack looked down at himself and tried to imagine what his mate must be seeing. Around the base of his larger than human cock was a large, circular knot, a bulbus glandis found in every canine species, including the wolf. The knot was nature’s way of ensuring conception for the male and female of primitive species by tying the two together long enough for the sperm to be effective. In shifters, the gland also secreted hormones to create the bond. The same hormones sealed a bond in male matings with the added benefit of providing incredibly long, intense orgasms in the way it affected the prostate. Though the secretions only occurred in the mating bond, the bonus of exceptional climaxes occurred whenever the knot was embedded strictly for pleasure, an involved explanation Zack was not going to take the time for then. “It’s my knot, sweetheart, and it will hurt like hell going in, but you can stretch to take it. I’ll go slow and be careful. I promise.Once it’s in, you’ll have a lot of orgasms, and they’ll be very mind blowing.Just hang on and try to ride it out till it’s over.” Gabe went back to his hand and knees, stuck out his ass, and wiggled it again.“Multiple orgasms? Let’s do this! Oh and don’t forget the condom. I’m not suicidal.” “I don’t need a condom, baby, and neither do you. Our blood affords us immunity from most diseases.” Gabe’s eyes widened. “You mean we can always go bareback?Damn, that’s a perk!” Zack laughed out loud, proud of his adventurous, sexy little lover. He lubed him up well and put his fingers in to stretch him before nudging the large head of his cock inside. Gabe twisted to look at him, taking his width without difficulty. A wave of love washed over Zack. He thrust deeply inside him, right up to the knot. Gabe pushed back on him. Zack took the opportunity to push in deep and hard, forcing some of the knot inside him. Gabe cried out and tried to pull away. Zack’s hand, clutching Gabe’s cock and balls, pulled him back. The other hand worked in the knot. “I warned you, baby. Push back against me, honey. Bear down and push out. You can take it.” While Gabestopped trying to get away, he moaned pitifully and almost broke Zack’s heart. “I’m sorry, darlin’.I don’t mean to hurt you, but it’s the only way. One more push.” He pulled Gabe back into him with one hand while he eased a finger in to help lever the knot inside with the other. With a pop, the knot slid past its thickest part and rammed deep inside him. Gabe arched his back and cried out with an immediate and intense orgasm, his prostate rubbed and bathed in the chemicals released from the gland. He reared back against Zack, lifting up to his knees. His own body pulsing, filling Gabe with his cum, Zackpulled Gabe’s head to the side by his hair, neck up to meet his mouth. He bit down on the side of his neck sharply, giving him the deep mating bite, ensuring Gabe was his forever. Gabe cried out in surprise and pain, followed quickly by a deep-throated groan of pleasure. His climax ebbing, Zack released the bite, licking at the wound on Gabe’s neck, taking his sweet blood. Zack held to Gabe’s body, twisting out of control. Making mindless whimpering sounds, Gabe’s breath came in big hitches as his body processed the chemicals flooding into him. Zack lowered him down, going with him as Gabe collapsed to the bed, their bodies tied together. Wave after wave of bliss engulfed Gabe. He cried out a lot from an experience too intense to last—except it did. On and on it went until he thought he might die. Zack wedged his hand under him and wrapped his hand around his cock, stroking it gently and soothingly. One orgasm started to ease off and another took its place. Gabe thought he might have howled a time or two, but most of the time he wanted only to be held and comforted by the very man who was killing him! He begged Zack to end it, but Zack murmured to him instead. The feelings grew too powerful, and he lost himself in a faint. He woke up in the middle of another orgasm. Too tired to fight it, he let it take him over and rode it like a wave. Another, then another and Zack whispered to him, soothed him, told him over and over he was his sweetheart, his lover, his mate. Gabe wasn’t sure he’d survive until the pressure in his ass eased, and Zack pulled out, stroking his back to relax him. Zackbit into his wrist and held it to Gabe’s mouth. “Drink, sweetheart. It will help tomake you mine completely.” Gabe let the bright sweetness spill over his lips. He remembered the taste and musk of honey, thick and delicious as he closed his eyes and latched onto Zack’s wrist. The blessed lassitude came over him in waves, soothing the pain and making him feel boneless and totally relaxed. He was flying again, higher than before. He soared up into the clouds, and they thickened around him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gabe-s-alpha-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-4/page-6.html","bookId":2256,"book":{"id":2256,"title":"Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4)","description":"Storyline: Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4) Gabe is a typical young college student until the night he and his mother are attacked by a beast who kills his mother and leaves Gabe for dead.
