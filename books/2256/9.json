I have plans for you tonight.”\\n\\n “Back at you, baby. Nowsit your little ass down, please.”\\n\\n Zack watchedhis mate eat the plate he’d filled for him, wondering how he’d lost control so easily. Gabe really did look amazing in those tight pants, but those would be kept in their bedroom from this point on for private showings only, and Zack was reconsideringGabe’s wearing leather and going shirtless at all.\\n\\n “I knowwhat you’re thinking,” Gabe said with a smile.“But I’m wearing these every day until you agree to put yours on too. When you do, I’ll wear the proper size.”\\n\\n “Oh really? You’re making the rules? What about what your alpha thinks?” Zack’s voice had dropped down low and menacing, a voice which made all of the wolves in his pack shiver with fear. Gabe was unimpressed.“I’m not a wolf. Not anymore.I’ve been making rules for myself for a long time. Oh, by the way, I have an idea about the collar you keep nagging me about. I’ll show you when you take me to town. When are you taking me, by the way? I need to get my truck out of the parkinglot before they think it’s abandoned.”\\n\\n Zack’s voice was still gruff as he answered him. “Tomorrow, I guess. Will that suit you, your highness?”\\n\\n “Yes, it will.” He wiped his mouth with his napkin.“And stop being so grouchy.I’ll suck your cock for you when I get you upstairs.” He grinned and winked at him.\\n\\n Zack had to shift in his seat to adjust himself.“Damn it, Gabe! Don’t say stuff like that. Somebody willhear you.”\\n\\n “Let ’em.” He stood up and stroked his hand over the bulge in his tight leathers.“C’mon, babe. I want you to rub this for me on the dance floor for a while before we go upstairs for the blow job I promised you.”\\n\\n He held out his hand and waggled his fingers. Zack stood up, sighing.“I don’t know what I’m going to do with you.” He took Gabe’s hand, but swatted his ass as Gabe led him onto the floor.\\n\\n Gabe reached up to put both arms around Zack’s neck, rubbing himself on Zack’s erection. “Just love me, babe. It’s all I ask.”\\n\\n Gabe gave his T-shirt a tug. Back in what he called his civvies for a trip to town, he actually missed the feel of the soft leather pants. Not that he’d tell Zack. He yawned widely as he ate his muffin and drank a large glass of milk.The milk was Zack’s idea. He made him drink some every morning, sayinghe didn’t think he looked healthy enough. Gabe thought he was trying to make him gain a little weight. Jealous ass. Gabe smiled to himself. Good luck with that. His mother had fussed for years over the fact he could eat pretty much anything and never gain weight. Besides, he loved milk. He only pretended not to, to let his sexy man think he was bossing him around a little.\\n\\n They got a late start, after Zack kept him up —literally—half the night. The man was insatiable, but Gabe loved every minute of it. He was beginning to care very deeply for this man, which was a good thing, he supposed, since he was mated to him for life, as Zack kept reminding him. He needed Zack to tell him he loved him first, though, to say the words, before he admitted how he felt about Zack.He’d been hurt before too many times to put his heart out there to be trampled on again. No, Zack was going to have to work a little harder for it.\\n\\n Zack f inished his coffee and put his hand under Gabe’s jaw in a soft caress. “Almost finished?I had one of the guys bring my truck around the front.”\\n\\n Gabe swallowed the last bite of muffin and got to his feet.“Ready to go. Can we go into town first? I had an idea about the collar I wanted to show you.”\\n\\n “Why do I get the feeling this is going to cost me some money? What kind of idea, anyway?”\\n\\n “You’ll see.”\\n\\n They walked out the front of the building together and got into Zack’s year-old black pickup. Compared to Gabe’s old truck, the newer truck was luxurious. Gabe sat back in the leather seat and arched a look at Zack.“Can I drive this sometime?”\\n\\n “Of course, darlin’. What’s mine is yours.”\\n\\n “You really mean it?” Gabe’s voice was low and hesitant.\\n\\n Zack looked over at him in surprise.“Of course I do. We’re mates, baby. Everything I have is yours.I’d do anything for you.”\\n\\n “Why, Zack? You hardly knowme, really.”\\n\\n “I knowyou,” Zack said indignantly. “You’re my mate. It waslove at first sight for me.”\\n\\n “Love? I knowyou don’t mean it, really.More like lust.”\\n\\n “Well, thattoo.” Gabe made a little sound of disapproval, and Zack turned to him smiling. “Oh, c’mon baby, lighten up. You were standing in the moonlight when I first saw you, naked, splashing water on your luscious body. What did you expect? Then, of course, I got to know the real you.”\\n\\n “You did?”\\n\\n “Uh-huh, and I loved you in spite of it.Ouch!” He yelled as Gabe gave him a punch on the arm.“I’m kidding.”\\n\\n Gabe stared out the window as they traveled down the mountain and got very quiet. Zack touched his arm.“I love you, Gabe. I have almost since the first minute I saw you. Not just lust. Love.”\\n\\n Gabe’s heart thumped in his chest, and he got a funny butterflies feeling in his stomach. Zack was saying it, justlike he’d wanted him to, but now the moment was here, it left him flustered. He wanted to say it back, but he was still afraid. Stalling for time, he laid a hand on Zack’s thigh. “I-I don’t know how I feel yet.I mean, I think I do, but I’d like to be sure before I say it. Is that all right for now?”\\n\\n Zack squeezed his hand.“It’s okay. You’ll say it when you’re ready. Okay, where do you want to go? Clayton is the closest town to us. Is that all right?”\\n\\n “So long as they have jewelry stores.”\\n\\n “Shit,” Zack said.“I knew this was going to cost me.”\\n\\n “I keep telling you I’m worth it, baby.”\\n\\n “Yeah and I keep telling you to prove it.”\\n\\n “I thought I proved it already. Guess I’ll have to remind you tonight.”\\n\\n “Or I could pull over now.”\\n\\n “No way. Take me to the jewelry store.We’re going to work on settling this collar thing once and for all.”\\n\\n Thirty minutes later, they arrived in Clayton and drove around looking for a jewelry store. Finally spotting one, Gabe made Zack pull in, and they went inside, Zack following Gabe around, a little puzzled as he passed by the chains and made straight for the wedding rings. He found one right away, a plain, white gold band, not too expensive.“Can we see this one, please?”\\n\\n The store clerk got it out for them, looking back and forth between them. He seemed a little uncomfortable and out of his depth. Homophobe, Gabe thought, and decided to ignore him.\\n\\n He held the ring out to Zack.“Try this on.” When Zack slipped it on his finger, Gabe smiled.“I like it. Give us a minute, please,” he said to the clerk. Turning to Zack, he smiled shyly, choosing his words carefully, not making any promises. “I might agree to do this collar thing—I’d only be doing it to make you happy, not because I’m your possession or anything—if you do something for me.I’d give it more consideration if I had my mark on you too, with a wedding ring.”\\n\\n Zack smiled.“Of course, I’ll wear a wedding ring. I’ve told you, honey, you’re it for me. I’ll never even look at another person, male or female. If it makes you happy, then let’s do it.”\\n\\n Smiling, Gabe turned back and signaled to the store clerk.“We’ll take this one.”\\n\\n “Wait a minute. I didn’t say I liked this one.” Zack handed the ring back to the clerk, and Gabe got a mutinous look on his face.“Show me this one.” He indicated a yellow gold band with three rather large diamonds across it. The clerk pulled it out, and Zack slipped it on his finger. “Much better.”\\n\\n The clerk said, “These are called Forever Bands. The stones represent past, present, and future.” He looked Zack up and down, taking in his casual jeans and T-shirt.“This particular ring is rather expensive.We have cheaper ones.”\\n\\n “No, I think we’ll take two of these. One for me and one for him. Nothing is too expensive for my darlin’.” He pulled out a credit card and gave it to the clerk, who took it and moved away to the register.“Close your mouth, darlin’,” he said to Gabe with a sideways glance.\\n\\n They had two of the right sizes in stock and soon the clerk handed the rings over to Zack. Zack slipped them in his pocket and strolled down to another counter where gold, silver, and yellow gold chains were displayed. Picking out a heavy wide yellow gold collar, he told the clerk to charge it as well.\\n\\n When they got outside to the truck, Zack took out the rings, handing his ring to Gabe.“Put this on me, sweetheart.”\\n\\n Not trusting himself to speak, Gabe wordlessly slipped the ring on Zack’s finger.\\n\\n Zack took Gabe’s ring, kissed it tenderly, and slipped it on Gabe’s finger. “Forever, I like the sound of that.”\\n\\n Gabe nodded, tears standing in his eyes. It had been so long since he thought anyone cared if he lived or died. He hadn’t expected anything like this when he set out to test Zack.\\n\\n Zack pulled out the yellow gold collar in its heavy box.“This is for you, whenever you decide.I’m going to give you a little more time to get used to the idea, because I’m such a good master.”\\n\\n Gabe punched Zack in the arm, but he laughed, and his eyes blurred with tears.He hadn’t fooled Zack a bit. Zack tilted his chin up to plant a kiss on his lips. “I love you, Gabriel. Please don’t doubt me, honey.”\\n\\n Hescooted over and tried his best to climb into Zack’s lap and cover his face with kisses.\\n\\n Zack laughed, pulling him up close by his hips.“Damn, baby, is jewelry what it takes to win you over?I wish I’d known a week ago.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gabe-s-alpha-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-4/page-9.html","bookId":2256,"book":{"id":2256,"title":"Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4)","description":"Storyline: Gabe\u0027s Alpha (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #4) \\n Gabe is a typical young college student until the night he and his mother are attacked by a beast who kills his mother and leaves Gabe for dead.
