{"id":7757,"no":14,"title":"RUTH\u0027S ILLNESS","content":"The following Sunday morning little Ruth was missing from the Manse pew, and her absence from that service was so unusual as to cause many inquiries. \"Nothing serious,\" said the mother. \"Just a little throat trouble, and as she seemed somewhat feverish we thought we had better leave her at home. Lizzie is taking care of her.\" But on Monday morning the doctor looked very anxious after an examination of Ruth\u0027s throat, and in departing advised the minister to keep out of the child\u0027s room until an examination a few hours later. On Tuesday morning it was a bit of village news that was passed from mouth to mouth, that the minister\u0027s little girl had diphtheria, and that the house was placarded. The occupants of the Manse were deeply touched during the following days by that spontaneous expression of practical sympathy that is characteristic of village life. But perhaps no one stirred the deepest emotions as did John Gage. Darkness had fallen over the village on Tuesday before he had heard of Ruth\u0027s sickness. There was some look of solicitation on Mrs. Short\u0027s face when John \"guessed\" he would stroll to the village. He answered the look by saying almost curtly, \"I\u0027m going to the Manse.\" The little patient\u0027s symptoms showed severe infection, and a second doctor was in consultation when the minister heard a very gentle rap on the door. \"Sorry I can\u0027t ask you in, John,\" he said, as he saw John standing on the verandah. \"How is she?\" asked the caller, in a tone that revealed a great concern. \"She is a very sick little girl, John. Dr. Dodds is with Dr. Burnett just now. We can only give her the best care possible, and hope and pray. It is good of you to call, and when the wee girl is better she will be pleased to know you came. The poor little soul has been restless and feverish all the afternoon.\" \"Poor little gal! Tell her John hopes she\u0027ll soon be alright. I ain\u0027t much of a friend, God knows, but all the same I\u0027ve been that lonesome like, since I heard she was sick, I don\u0027t feel as if I want to do anything, but just wait around. If there\u0027s any job I can do to help, I give you my word I\u0027ll be in trim to do it as long as the little gal needs me.\" For two weeks John\u0027s \"little gal\" caused anxious days and nights—some of them days and nights when tearful prayers were sobbed out in the solitariness of study or bedroom—times when the physicians found no hopeful signs, and the little life seemed to be passing beyond human reach. It was on one such night that John brought a few delicacies from the farm for the minister\u0027s household, and waited for the report from the sick-room. \"The doctor has been with her an hour, John, and the wee girl is alive, and that\u0027s all we can say.\" The voice broke into a sob as the last words were spoken. The two men stood in silent sympathy for a few minutes, and then John broke the silence. \"She was friendly to me, sir, and I\u0027ll never forget it. Lots of folks what thinks they\u0027re big toads in the puddle treats me as if I was dirt, but the little gal is the biggest Christian of the lot, and she\u0027s done me more good than the whole gang of \u0027em. Say! the way she put her little hand on my face that Sunday morning was better\u0027n any sermon I ever heard. Queer, ain\u0027t it, but it broke me all up.\" Then in response to a request from the minister John continued, \"I\u0027m afeared it wouldn\u0027t count much if I tried to pray, sir; but there ain\u0027t anything I wouldn\u0027t try my hand at for her.\" The following day there was better news, and two days later the little sufferer was able to smile in response to the tokens of love that were showered upon her. The physicians\u0027 faces relaxed, and they were delighted that professionally they were winning the battle, and the big-hearted senior physician rejoiced for other reasons. \"By the way,\" he said that night in the Manse study, \"I have met that fellow John Gage several times lately, and his interest in Ruthie is really remarkable. I didn\u0027t think it was in the man to care for anybody. And stranger still, he was sober each time. The little girl may yet be the salvation of the poor chap, and do what no one else has been able to do.\" Shortly before St. Valentine\u0027s Day the Manse was thoroughly fumigated, and the placard removed. Ruth was amusing herself cutting out the kindergarten suggestions for Valentines, and sending them to selected friends. On a crudely shaped heart in poorly fashioned letters that she had learned to print, were the words, \"Ruth loves John.\" On February the 14th, John Gage received the tiny envelope containing his Valentine. Nothing he had received in years pleased him quite so much. \"Now, ain\u0027t that great,\" he confided to Mrs. Short, \"\u0027tain\u0027t worth a cent, I suppose, but just this very minute they\u0027re ain\u0027t enough money in the whole village to buy it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3025/83674.html","bookId":257,"book":{"id":257,"title":"Trail-Tales of Western Canada","description":"简介： Old Ken was down on his luck.
