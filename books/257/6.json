{"id":7749,"no":6,"title":"\"THY TOUCH HAS STILL ITS ANCIENT POWER\"","content":"Jack Roande was on one of his periodical sprees. For eight years he had been going the pace. They had been long, weary years to the one whom Jack had vowed to love and cherish. Night after night, through these long years, she had listened for the awful home-coming. There were few in the little mining town but had often seen her eyes reddened by weeping, and all knew of the Eastern home she had left. Among those who had joined in the \"send-off,\" nearly fifteen years ago, were two men whose names are still honoured household words throughout the Dominion. There was no note of sadness that day, for Jack was a \"model young man,\" and every one agreed that there was \"no finer girl than Nell.\" Jack blamed his downfall to dabbling in politics. \"Politics are rotten in this province,\" said he, as he endeavoured to excuse his condition; but perhaps, as a chum of Jack\u0027s said, he only blamed politics \"\u0027cause a fellow generally tries to find a soft place to fall.\" Whatever the cause, at least the fact was plain to all in the town that Jack was \"down and out.\" The business men said so, and agreed with the authorities that Jack was a nuisance to the town. Some of those who had assisted in his downfall spoke of him as a \"dirty loafer,\" and even the bar-rooms, where he had \"spent all,\" tolerated his presence only when the cruel pity of some patron called him in for a treat, or when he could exhibit some coin. It was through the \"tender mercies of the wicked\" to Jack that there were three empty stockings in the Roande home on the recent Christmas Eve. \"For the children\u0027s sake,\" there had been a tearful plea that the husband would be home Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. With glad expectancy the meagre resources of the pantry were combined by loving hands to give the nearest possible approach to a feast. From the near-by woods the children had brought cedar and pine for decorative purposes, and these, with stray bits of brightly-coloured tissue paper, had done much to give the home a Christmas appearance. The usual notes had been written to Santa Claus, and the mother-heart had lovingly suggested a curtailment of such requests as Santa might find it difficult to grant. The little ones had thrown their letters into the fire, and watched some of the gauzy ashes carried up the chimney to the mysterious but generous friend of the children, who would soon be loading his sleigh somewhere in the far north. Jack appeared to respond to his wife\u0027s pleadings, and so on account of her many home duties she confided to him some of the requests the children had made, and how the much-coveted toys were parcelled and waiting to be called for at one of the down-town stores. No word was spoken of the sacrifice the purchases had involved, nor of the sting love had endured when for the children\u0027s sake she began to take in sewing. It was therefore agreed that Jack should bring the parcel home shortly before tea on Christmas Eve, and in the darkness it could be hidden away until the little ones were asleep. Jack was true to his word, and started for home with the precious toys under his arm, in ample time for the evening meal. \"Merry Christmas, Jack,\" called a voice as Jack was rounding the saloon corner; \"come on in and have one.\" \"Guess I\u0027d better get home,\" was the hesitating reply. It needed little persuasion, however, to get Jack inside, and after a second treat he lost all anxiety to reach home, and was ready for a night\u0027s debauch. During the tea-hour the bar patrons became fewer, and Jack\u0027s chances for further drinks were far apart. In response to a request to \"chalk up a couple of whiskeys,\" he received an emphatic \"not on your life\" from the bar-tender. There was a momentary conflict within Jack, and then the beast became lord over the man. Going to the corner he brought his parcel from the bench and placed it on the bar. \"How much can I draw on for that?\" There was a wild determination in the voice. Unwrapping the parcel beneath the bar, the bar-tender at once knew what the contents meant. \"I don\u0027t want \u0027em, Jack: you better get home to your kids.\" But Jack was insistent, and gradually the other weakened. \"Well, it\u0027s your property, and if you\u0027re going to sell \u0027em I guess I may as well buy \u0027em as anybody else. I\u0027ll chalk you fifty cents.\" The articles were worth three times the amount offered, but Jack was being consumed with that hellish thirst that he had developed through many years, and he at once started to use up his credit. A mile away an anxious wife awaited Jack\u0027s return. Cheerfully she had gone about her work until the hour for the evening meal, but with the passing moments the husband\u0027s absence caused her fears to increase. With forced smiles she did her best to bring into the home the gladness that belongs to Christmas Eve, but the heart was heavy, and the little ones saw now and again the tears that could not be suppressed. Bedtime was prolonged to two hours beyond the customary time, but still there was no sign of the father. Once the mother expressed the fears that were in her heart when she suggested that sometimes Santa Claus did not get to homes when the father was away, at which suggestion there were tearful little eyes and oft-expressed wishes that \"daddy\" would come home. Bravely the mother gathered the three children around her chair for their good-night sing. Favourite hymns of the Sabbath School were sung, and all the time four pairs of ears were alert for the sound of Jack\u0027s return. It was while Grace\u0027s favourite hymn, \"I am so glad that our Father in Heaven,\" was being sung, that footsteps were heard at the door. Instantly the little ones ceased their singing, as Grace joyously shouted, \"It\u0027s daddy; Santa Claus will come now, won\u0027t he, mother?\" For a minute or two before Grace\u0027s glad shout two men had stood an the darkness outside the Roande home. After he had been turned out of the \"Kelby House,\" Jack had staggered and stumbled around the streets for some time, and at last lay prostrate in the snow not far from the home of one who had often befriended him. A woman hurrying along the street suddenly saw the dark form on the snow, and with a cry of fear ran to the near-by house. The minister who resided there, at once recognizing poor Jack, dragged him into the house, and after securing a neighbour\u0027s sleigh and a driver, started for Jack\u0027s home. From the sleigh to the house he managed to conduct Jack safely, but when the strains of \"I am so glad\" from childish voices reached his ears, he stood still for a moment. How could he take such a father home at such a time! Yet it was impossible for him to remain long outside with Jack as he was, and so he guided the poor drunken father onward. Jack stumbled and fell heavily against the door just as Grace\u0027s glad shout silenced the hymn-singing. The minister was dragged almost to the floor as the door sprang open and Jack lurched into the room. Few words were spoken, for all hearts were sad as the stupefied man almost immediately fell asleep on the floor of the sitting-room, and filled the air with the drunkard\u0027s stench. The little ones were tenderly told to go to their beds. \"Had he a parcel when you found him?\" whispered the mother as soon as she could control her voice. Then followed the narration of her plans to fill the three stockings that had already been hung up at the back of the stove. And now it was too late to find out what had happened to the parcel. The minister looked into the mother\u0027s face, and then at the three empty stockings with their mute appeal for a visit from Santa Claus. \"I could bear this, hard as it is,\" she continued, glancing at the drunken sleeper, \"but the poor children——.\" The head dropped on her arms which were resting on the table, and quietly she wept over the bitter disappointment the little ones must bear on Christmas morning. \"Mrs. Roande\"—a hand touched her shoulder lightly—\"if you are not too wearied to wait up I\u0027ll do my best to locate the parcel.\" The look from the grateful mother was all that was needed to send the minister forth on his errand of love. The store from which the toys were secured was closed, but the proprietor had not yet retired, and was able to reassure the midnight visitor that Jack had procured the parcel shortly before supper-time. It was not long before the clue led the minister to the home of the bar-tender. Wearied, but with mingled sorrow and anger, he rang the door bell. The man he was looking for came downstairs partly disrobed, and was manifestly surprised at a pastoral call, especially at such an hour. The minister stepped unasked into the hall. \"Mr. Klint, I apologize for disturbing you, but Mr. Roande left a parcel somewhere that I must find to-night, and I understand he was in your bar-room. Do you know anything about it?\" The answer not being satisfactory, a further question was put. \"No, sir, he left nothing; we had a square deal, but that\u0027s nobody\u0027s business but mine and his.\" \"May I then ask if a parcel containing toys had any place in that deal?\" No answer being given, the minister said with quiet firmness, \"I must have an answer to that question before I leave this house. Mr. Klint, this is Christmas Eve! There are three empty stockings hanging in the room where Jack Roande lies drunk, and the things intended for those stockings must be there before morning.\" \"I\u0027m not obliged to tell you or anybody else anything about my business,\" answered Klint surlily; \"but if you are so anxious to know, then I can tell you that I bought that parcel to oblige Jack, and it was his deal, not yours.\" \"This is not the time for much talking. Be good enough to tell me where the parcel is now, and what you paid for it.\" Again there was hesitancy, and again there was pressure. At last the information was elicited that the toys were beneath the roof that sheltered them, and that the price paid was fifty cents. \"Be good enough for the children\u0027s sake, if not for your own, to take back your fifty cents and let me take the parcel.\" Eventually the deal was consummated. When the toys were safely in his possession the minister said, \"Mr. Klint, if you were dealt with as you deserve, you would spend Christmas day, not in your own comfortable home, but in the hospital or in jail: I only hope you are not as contemptible as your deed. I shall see you again, some other day.\" The hand-clasp from the thankful mother was ample repayment for the midnight search, and in the early morning the exclamations of delight from her little ones in turn lifted something of the burden from her trouble-worn life. Thus had it been, sorrow after sorrow, for poor Nell Roande for over eight years, and at times she felt there was little hope of any change, but the new day was soon to come, and the night of weeping was to be turned into the morn of song. On the Tuesday night following the commencement of special services, as a little group of young men were leaving the Pool-room adjoining the Opera House, Jack Roande came stumbling along. It was a great joke, so Bill Thornton thought, to \"jolly\" Jack into believing that there was a \"free show in the Opera House, with pretty girls and swell dancing.\" Within a few minutes Jack was sitting with eyes as wide open as he could get them, ready to take in the \"swell dancing.\" He quickly realized that he had been fooled, and catching the word \"religion\" he shook his fist as he departed saying, \"Religion! it\u0027s all d——d rot. There\u0027s nothing in it.\" The missioner was down the aisle in a few seconds, and as Jack was passing through the swinging doors a kindly hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a voice, made tender by acquaintance with the Friend of sinners, said \"Good-night, friend; you have the marks of a gentleman although you have made a slip to-night. I hope you will come again.\" Returning to the platform he continued his message, but it was easy to see that the speaker\u0027s heart was out in the night whereever Jack was. Was it that yearning that brought Jack back again in less than half an hour? Be that as it may, the man who had left with a curse, staggered in again before the closing hymn, and made not the slightest disturbance after he reached a seat. At the close he conversed in as intelligent a way as his intoxication permitted. The conversation need not be recorded. It was one of several. Five nights later, twenty minutes after the clock had made its lengthiest strike, a subdued knock was heard at the door of the home in which the missioner was being entertained. The burner of midnight oil hurried downstairs. Jack stood in the doorway. \"Mr. Williams, I\u0027ve got to settle it, and I\u0027ve got to do it now.\" Two souls tarried in the upper room, and while they tarried He came. At last the broken cry ascended, \"My Father, I want to get back to Thee. Help me to walk in the paths of righteousness, for Jesus\u0027 sake. Amen.\" It was a great night for the fisher of men. Like the wearied disciples of old, he said \"It is the Lord.\" The following night, Jack Jr., Mamie and Grace accompanied their father to the service, and happily united their voices in the service of praise. Grace—they called her \"Gay,\" for that was the best pronunciation wee Jean, now departed, could once give—told several of her schoolmates confidentially in her mother\u0027s words, that she had a \"new daddy.\" And the subsequent days have proven the truth of her assertion. The closing night arrived. The Opera House was crowded, and from the opening words, \"Our Father,\" until the \"And now I commend you to God,\" every one present seemed to feel that this was no ordinary religious gathering. An opportunity was given for a word from new converts. Tenderly, prayerfully, these were urged to in some way publicly confess their new-found Lord. There was a hush as Jack stood erect. In a low, clear voice he addressed himself particularly to the half-hundred young men at the back. \"I do not need to tell you what I was. Two weeks ago it would have been inconceivable to you and to me that the change I have experienced could take place. There is only One who could do it, and He has done it. I cannot say more now, but if you want to know all about it, come to me at the close of this service, or come to my home.\" The eyes of the wife at his side were red again, but the tears were tears of joy. \"It is very wonderful: we are all so happy. Oh, how glad I am that these services have been held,\" were her farewell words. Jack\u0027s hand was the last one the missioner clasped. \"Jack, you will be God\u0027s man. I go, but He remains. This change is all His doing, and He will hold you fast if you only trust Him. Many a day I\u0027ll pray for you, Jack. Remember that your feelings may change, but your purposes must endure. Good-bye.\" \"Good-bye, Mr. Williams; God helping me I won\u0027t fail. It\u0027ll be no easy business, but I\u0027m not in the fight alone; God\u0027s in it too. Good-bye.\" And the years that have passed since these words were spoken have shown clearly enough that Jack is not fighting alone. Once again prayerful hearts are returning thanks for the touch that \"has still its ancient power.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3025/83666.html","bookId":257,"book":{"id":257,"title":"Trail-Tales of Western Canada","description":"简介： Old Ken was down on his luck.
