{"id":7745,"no":2,"title":"OLD KEN\u0027S ROUND-UP","content":"Old Ken was \"down on his luck.\" For well-nigh fifty years he had \"gone the pace\" in a district where certain men say glibly, \"there\u0027s no God west of the Rockies.\" The old prospector had been, according to those who knew him best, in one of three conditions for some years. He was either \"getting drunk, drunk, or sobering up.\" And yet in spite of his weakness and sin, and in spite of the curses he got, there was no more popular man in the whole camp than Old Ken, although likely he was not conscious of it. One of the miners had once expressed a conviction about Ken that was dangerously popular. It was at the time Frank Stacey\u0027s mother died, in the East, and Frank had not \"two bits\" to his credit. As might have been expected, it was Old Ken who started the hat to wire that Frank was leaving on the next train, and to see that he had \"enough of the needful to do the decent thing.\" \"It\u0027s his last chance, boys,\" said Ken, as he made the rounds during the noon hour. \"I got twenty-two dollars since eleven o\u0027clock, so I guess, with what you fellers is a-going to do, the old camp\u0027s on the job, as usual, when a chap like Frank wants to pay his last respects.\" There was some mystery about those twenty-two dollars until Andy the bar-tender told how Old Ken had \"got it out of the boss\" on the solemn promise that for two weeks he would \"work like a Texas steer\" without touching a cent until the debt of thirty dollars, minus eight for board, was discharged. Then it was that one of the boys expressed himself thus about Ken: \"By gosh, fellers, he\u0027s white clear through, that same old soak is, when there\u0027s any trouble on. He\u0027s a pile decenter than his thirsty old carcase \u0027ll let him be.\" On a particular morning some months ago the old prospector stood at the little station a mile or so away from the camp centre. The \"mixed\" was winding her way slowly around the curves of the summit of the Rockies. From the windows of the solitary passenger car a young man looked somewhat anxiously across the valley below. A few shacks nestled among the poplar brush, and in the distance an unpainted building stood, with distinct outline, towering against the dark background of the mountain range opposite. The young man knew well enough, from his work among the miners and loggers, that yonder building was as a moral cancer eating out the best life of the community. The outlook was not bright, but he was on the King\u0027s Business, and he knew that he had in his care the mightiest thing, and the greatest remedy, the world knows of. Alone he stepped off the train, and being the only arrival he received the entire benefit of Old Ken\u0027s curious but not unfriendly gaze. The new-comer, who was conducting special services at selected mining and lumbering camps that were considered especially needy, looked around for a district missionary who was expected to act as his pilot for a few days. No one but Old Ken and the station agent were in sight, so after friendly greetings to the former the young preacher made known the purpose of his visit. Old Ken listened courteously. \"Well, stranger, you\u0027ve hit the right spot alright; we kin stand the gospel in big doses here for sure; most of us is whiskey soaks or bums, and some of us is both. I wish you luck, partner, but I\u0027m feared most of us is incurable. Yes, partner, I\u0027m feared you\u0027ve come too late, too late.\" The Frenchman who was hotel-keeper, professional gambler, lumberman and mine-owner, was not enthusiastic about allowing the sky-pilot to board in his notorious hotel and gambling den, but eventually accommodation was secured. The dance-hall was procured for the services, and Ken volunteered the information that the preacher wouldn\u0027t likely be disturbed, because there were only four women left in the camp, and he added, \"two of \u0027em can dance like elephants and one\u0027s got ingrowing toenails or something else, so there\u0027s only one on duty, and that ain\u0027t enough variety for a good hop.\" A few days after the services commenced, Old Ken managed to replenish his treasury by the fortunate desire on the part of two men to get a haircut. The old man boasted that he knew how to do most things. \"I\u0027m never idle, preacher,\" he said with a wink; \"when I ain\u0027t doing something I\u0027m a-doing nothin\u0027, so I\u0027m always a-doing something you see.\" No sooner were the locks shorn than the old man made his way to the bar-room. He was emerging from his favourite haunt when the preacher met him. \"\u0027Taint no use pretending I\u0027m what I ain\u0027t, preacher,\" he said after a few minutes\u0027 conversation. \"I\u0027m an old fool and I know it, but what does it matter? Who cares?\" \"It matters a good deal to you, Ken,\" the preacher replied quietly, \"and there are some of us who care. Ken, if you would give God as big a place in your life as you\u0027ve given whiskey there wouldn\u0027t be room for the things that have made you call yourself an old fool. I know He could make a mighty good man of you, Ken.\" \"Thank you kindly, preacher, but you don\u0027t know me: I\u0027m the hardest old guy in this country; the fellers around here think they can go it some, but let \u0027em all get as full as they kin hold and I\u0027ll take as much as any one of \u0027em and then put twelve glasses more on top of that to keep it kind of settled, and then pile the whole gang under the table and walk out like a gentleman. Yes, sir, I kin do it; and if a feller\u0027s as big as a house I\u0027ll whittle him down to my size and lick him. Yer intentions are good, partner, but you\u0027re about fifty years late on this job.\" The days allotted to the mission were rapidly passing away, and while not a few had given evidence of seeing \"the vision splendid,\" there were some after whom \"the little preacher,\" as he had come to be generally spoken of in the camp, greatly longed. Coming down the stairs one day he saw Old Ken standing with his back to the stair rail. Putting his hand on the old man\u0027s shoulder he entered into conversation. \"Ken, you haven\u0027t been to one of the services yet, and I want you to come to-night.\" \"Lord bless you, preacher, if I went to a religious meeting the roof \u0027ud fall in for sure, and I don\u0027t want to bust up the dance-hall.\" But the little preacher was not in a mood to be \"jollied\" that day. \"Ken,\" he continued, \"I\u0027d like you to give God a chance. Do you know, I like the look of you, and——\" The old prospector cut the sentence short, straightened up, and gazed appreciatively into the speaker\u0027s eyes. \"What\u0027s that you said, preacher? What\u0027s that you said? You like the look o\u0027 me! Well, siree, that\u0027s the decentest thing that\u0027s been said to me in thirty years! Yes, sir, it is: I\u0027m treated like a yaller dog around here; but you speak decently to a yaller dog, he\u0027ll wag his tail. He likes it, you know. Say, preacher, when you need me just you whistle and I\u0027m on the job!\" \"I take your offer, old man,\" said the preacher. \"I\u0027ve been here for some time and I\u0027ve heard a good deal that I didn\u0027t want to hear. Some of you fellows have been cursing pretty nearly day and night since I came. I didn\u0027t want to hear it, but I couldn\u0027t get away from it. I\u0027ve heard the boys; it\u0027s only fair they should hear me. Ken, you round them up and bring them to the dance-hall.\" Ken\u0027s hand was extended. \"Here\u0027s my hand on it, preacher; I\u0027m yer man. If the boys ain\u0027t there you\u0027ll see my head in a sling in the morning.\" At 7.30 Ken organized himself into an Invitation Committee. There were rumours that he even brushed his coat. At any rate, at 7.45 he stood at the door of the gambling den, and with an air of unusual importance he succeeded in getting silence long enough to tell \"the boys\" that there was \"a religious show on in the dance-hall.\" \"The procession will form in ten minutes,\" he continued, \"and every —— man in this place has got to be in it.\" A few laughed; some cursed at the interruption, and others were so engrossed in their game that they appeared not to have heard. In a few minutes Ken entered the barroom and started his round-up. After telling one or two quietly that it was \"up to him\" to get the boys to the religious show, he made his proclamation. \"Come out of this, you —— fellers, and come up to the —— dance-hall and give the —— little preacher a fair show, or I\u0027ll kick the —— hide off you.\" The writer has no apology to make for blasphemy either in the East or West, but like classical music, to some ears, Old Ken\u0027s blasphemous language was not so bad as it sounded. After the old man had brought into use all his remarkable reserve of Western mining camp vocabulary, there was only one man besides the bar-tender who failed to join the procession. The services had become well advertised throughout the entire district by this time, so that when Old Ken arrived with his company the little hall was fairly well filled. But the old man was \"going to see this thing through,\" and so, despite the protestations that almost upset the gravity of the preacher conducting the preliminary song service, the gang was coaxed and forced to the front seats. Ken directed the seating operations in a way that suggested his ownership of the entire place. In a stage whisper he instructed the boys to \"get a squint at the preacher\u0027s hair.\" With pride he continued, \"mighty good cut that, I performed the operation this afternoon.\" At the close of the service he came to the platform. \"Say, preacher, that was a great bunch. There ain\u0027t a —— (excuse me, preacher, I forgot you don\u0027t swear), but say, there ain\u0027t a man of \u0027em but\u0027s done time. I\u0027ll tell you, preacher, we\u0027ll run this show together. I\u0027ll round \u0027em up and you hit \u0027em;\" then with a swing of his big arm he added, \"and hit \u0027em hard. See here, preacher, you take a tip from me; us old sinners don\u0027t want to listen to none of yer stroke-\u0027em-down-easy preachers; we wants a feller what \u0027ll tell us we\u0027re d—— fools to be hoodwinked by hitting the pace, and what\u0027ll help us to get up after he shows us we\u0027re down.\" A few nights later the preacher had Ken\u0027s \"bunch\" particularly in view as he delivered his message. Near the close he asked during one of those times of reverent silence that may be felt but not described: \"Are not some of you men tired of going the pace? You know it doesn\u0027t pay. Many a time you curse yourselves for being fools, and yet you go back to the old ways that blast your life. Men! God knows how some of you are tempted, and He is ready to help. His Son came into the world to save sinners. He stood in the face of the fiercest temptations, and with the command of a conqueror He said, \u0027Get thee behind Me.\u0027 And, Men! He is ready to stand alongside of every passion-torn man to-day and to help him to overcome. Isn\u0027t there some man here to-night who wants to do the decent thing, and who will accept His offer of help in the biggest fight any man has?\" The words were simple and commonplace enough, but the One who uses stumbling lips was present that night. Unexpectedly one man arose, pulling himself up by the back of the seat in front of him—a sin-marred man, trembling as a result of daily dissipation—and said in a muffled voice, \"I want to do the decent.\" A confirmed gambler not far away stood up and merely said, \"Me too, Bob.\" Another, in a tone of despair, cried, \"God and me knows there\u0027s nothing in this kind of life! Oh the d——, d—— whiskey, it\u0027s ruined me.\" Late into the night the preacher walked along the trail with one of these sin-wrecked men; but the transformation of that life and other lives must constitute a separate story. A few days before the mission closed Old Ken came to the preacher and announced his intended departure from the camp. \"You see, stranger, the camp\u0027s pretty quiet, and I ain\u0027t a-making enough money to buy a dress for a humming-bird. I ain\u0027t got the wherewithal for a ticket, but if I strike the right kind of conductor I guess I\u0027ll make the grade. You see they can\u0027t put a feller off between stations in this country. So I\u0027ll get one station along anyway, and if they chuck me off I\u0027ll wait for the next train, and a few chucks and I\u0027ll get to N—— anyway.\" The following morning prospector and preacher walked together down the railway track to the little station. A farewell word was spoken, and a farewell token slipped into the big hard hand. Old Ken stood a moment or two on the steps of the car. There was a far-away look in the old man\u0027s eyes as he gazed in the direction of the distant Cascade range. \"Good-bye, preacher. Yes, maybe, maybe we\u0027ll strike the main trail that leads home. I hope so—God knows—maybe it ain\u0027t too late for me yet. I kinder think lately that God wants Old Ken. Good-bye, preacher; God bless you.\" Three months later \"the little preacher\" received a letter from a British Columbia miner. One paragraph may be quoted here: \"Poor Old Ken was burned to death in a hotel fire in S—— three weeks ago. He was the kindest old man I ever met, and as long as I live I shall thank God for the night he rounded us up and brought us to your meeting in the dance-hall.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3025/83662.html","bookId":257,"book":{"id":257,"title":"Trail-Tales of Western Canada","description":"简介： Old Ken was down on his luck.
