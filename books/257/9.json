{"id":7752,"no":9,"title":"THE COOKEE","content":"It had been a bitterly cold drive across what was known as \"The Plains,\" and the student missionary was thankful when his pony reached the shelter of the jack-pines. After a few miles of bush a small \"clearance\" was reached. The low-roofed shack standing at the back of it never looked more inviting than to-day; but though twenty-five miles from the \"highway of commerce,\" there were homes still more remote that had been expecting a visit from the little preacher for some time, and so, despite his pony\u0027s protest against driving by even poor shelter in weather like this, he had regretfully to tell her she might not turn in that road to-day. As was the missionary\u0027s custom in passing any dwellings, he waved his greeting in the direction of the humble shack. Before he had gone many yards the good-natured pioneer farmer was outside shouting his \"halloos,\" and, on being heard, signalled for the preacher to stop. Making his way through the snow, he said, \"Ain\u0027t you going to give us a call to-day? Better come in and get thawed out; soon be grubbing time.\" \"Not to-day, Mac, thanks,\" was the reply. \"I\u0027ve been to your place pretty often, and I thought I ought to make the end of this road to-day.\" \"Well, if you won\u0027t come in, I\u0027ll tell you what I was a-wanting to ask you. There\u0027s a fellow I\u0027d like you to see awful well. Say! do you call on anybody else except Protestants? You do, eh? Well, I wish you\u0027d see Jimmy Hayson. He\u0027s in a bad fix. They shipped him home from the camp. He was cookee there, and I guess he couldn\u0027t stand that kind of life. His stummick\u0027s gone on a holiday. Anyway, he\u0027s most all in. It ain\u0027t much of a trail to follow, but after you pass Marston\u0027s you\u0027ll see a wood road, and then, if you keep your eyes skinned, on the north side you\u0027ll see, about forty rod along, a foot track—Jimmy ain\u0027t got any team—just follow the track, and you\u0027ll stumble into his shack.\" The second stop that afternoon was at Hayson\u0027s. It was a poor place for a sick man to be in. The entire furnishings of the home would not have been a bargain at five dollars. The wife was most grateful for the visit, and before the missionary had spoken to the invalid, she said, \"You are the only preacher ever in our house; and will you make a bit of a prayer for Jimmy?\" A few flour sacks had been made into a curtain, and the faithful wife pulled them aside and gazed lovingly at the sick man, and then questioningly at the missionary. The missionary felt that not many prayers would have to be made for Jimmy, and perhaps there was an increased tenderness in the voice as it was lifted to the Friend of the weary and heavy-laden. The five children were not very clear as to what was going on, and during the devotions the dog kept up a low growl of distrust at the whole procedure, but the wasted form of poor Jimmy, and the subdued sobs of the wife, overshadowed minor disturbances. It was the first of almost a dozen calls during the next two months. A round trip of thirty-two miles once a week meant something over unbeaten tracks; but Jimmy was in need, and there was only One Helper: other helpers had failed, and Jimmy was pathetically eager for something he had not hitherto received. On the occasion of the fourth visit, the wife called the visitor as far away from the sick bed as the dimensions of the little shack permitted. \"Would you\"—the voice was agitated—\"would you——. Oh! please, you won\u0027t mind me asking, but would you stay for dinner; we\u0027ve never had a minister take a bite in our house, and Jimmy\u0027d be so pleased?\" The invitation was most gladly accepted. What a time ensued! How the poor soul exerted herself to prepare that meal! It was over an hour before the \"bite\" was ready, and in that hour one child had gone over two miles. The preacher saw her fluttering rags as she ran across the snow. He saw her come back with a little newspaper package. It contained a knife and fork—two miles, that the preacher might have a knife and fork! The meal was not appetizing, but after the trouble it had cost, no man with a heart could leave a morsel which it was possible to dispose of. Day by day Jimmy weakened, and it was evident that he needed attention and quiet, such as was not possible in the one-roomed shack. Could he gain entrance to the distant hospital, and was it possible to provide anything like a satisfactory conveyance in which the sick man could safely make the journey from that pioneer district? These possibilities especially occupied the mind of the missionary on a subsequent visit. He talked to the now worn-out wife about the matter. Prejudices against hospitals were very real in that remote district, and it was some time before she could be convinced that such a course would be in the interest of the family. The few neighbours did much coming and going for the next two days, and such blankets and wrappings as the community afforded were provided for the cold journey. Bricks and hardwood sticks were to be heated and placed around Jimmy to keep him as warm as possible. Henry Wallis was to make the trip the day before to arrange for the replenishing of these, and for some nourishment for the sick man, at three selected stopping-places. It was late in the evening when the sleigh pulled up in front of the hospital. The sufferer had stood the journey better than was expected. The \"Sisters\" soon had Jimmy in the most comfortable bed that he had occupied for years. Two days later the missionary called at the hospital as early in the morning as he was permitted to. Jimmy knew his end was not far distant. He could speak but little, and in order to hear the feeble whisper it was necessary to put an ear close to the patient\u0027s lips. Very slowly the words came: \"Say—about—Shepherd.\" Once more the Shepherd Psalm was repeated with its message for those whose lives are overshadowed. Jimmy\u0027s eyes spoke his thanks, and tenderly the student wiped the tears off the sunken cheeks. Something else was wanted. Again the whisper was with difficulty understood: \"Tell—about—rest.\" It was the words that only the publican Matthew has recorded that Jimmy wanted to hear. Slowly they were repeated: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" Once again the parched lips moved: \"If—I—could—see children—that\u0027s all.\" The eyes were so irresistibly pleading that the student could only reply, \"I\u0027ll try, Jimmy.\" A few words were spoken to the nurse. How long would Jimmy be here? She thought he might go that night. Certainly within three days the end would come. It was no small undertaking to bring a family such as the Haysons into town. Clothing had to be procured in order that the little ones might be protected on the longest journey any of them had ever taken. Their own scanty attire would afford little protection from the cold wind. And so hurried visits were made to a few homes, and to the stores of one or two merchants. The case was briefly stated, and a dozen hearts instantly kindled into kindness for the needy ones in the lonely home. A wardrobe, such as the Hayson family had never dreamed of, was soon stowed away on the missionary\u0027s \"jumper.\" Inside of two hours the long, cold drive was commenced. At each shanty and shack word was given as to the sick man\u0027s condition, and what the present journey was for. Within five miles of the lonely home, which would soon be the abode of the fatherless and widow, the missionary stopped for the night. In the dimly-lighted shack of Sandy MacGregor Jimmy\u0027s last request was made known. MacGregor rose from a nail-keg on which he was sitting, and said slowly and emphatically, \"Well, if Jimmy wants to see the children, he\u0027s a-going to see \u0027em.\" The student grasped the roughened hand of the speaker gratefully. \"I knew I could count on you, Mac. Thanks. I\u0027m tired, so I\u0027ll say good-night. I can sleep now that that\u0027s settled.\" Before the missionary appeared the next morning, Mac had everything ready for driving Jimmy\u0027s family into the town where the husband and father was rapidly nearing his end. The horses were driven as hard as was consistent with mercy. Jimmy was still alive, the Sister told them as they stood in the hall. In a moment they were beside the bed. It was one of those scenes that live in the memory. The sobbing wife, kissing again and again the poor, wan face. The little ones weeping, perhaps more in sympathy with the mother than on account of their own realization of the coming sorrow. Quietly the large screen was placed around the group at the bedside, and for a few moments the family was left alone. The journey had been accomplished just in time. In less than an hour Jimmy was gone. His last request was for the passages of Scripture mentioned above. \"Yes, that\u0027s it,\" he whispered, \"rest—rest.\" The wasted arm was raised a little as if he would put it around the missionary\u0027s shoulder, but the poor Cookee\u0027s strength had departed. They saw he would say something more, and ears were alert to catch his every word. \"I—think——\" Then there was a long pause, and the sunken eyes turned from face to face as though seeking to tell them what the tongue refused to utter. They waited with tear-bedimmed gaze, but no other word was uttered. Ere long there was a rattling in the throat, and the death-pallor increased; a few short and long-separated gasps and the Cookee had finished his course. They laid him away in the quiet little cemetery during an almost blinding snowstorm. With less than five dollars in cash, and a rough bit of land heavily mortgaged, the mother went back to the lonely shack to toil through weary days to provide for her five little children. With occasional help from other settlers, the struggle for existence was made a little less severe. * * * * * Ten years have passed away. The poverty-stricken pioneers of earlier days have cleared large sections of land, and the earth has brought forth her fruit. Prosperity abounds. Where Jimmy Hayson\u0027s shack stood is an attractive modern farm-house. A mother looks proudly at her farmer son as she introduces him to a city pastor who is visiting the mission field of his student ministry. A few hours later, in the quiet of eventide, she stands with the visitor exchanging incidents of bygone days. \"It\u0027s been a pretty hard road to travel, sir, but the neighbours were just as good as they could be after Jimmy went. But I often say to my boy Allan that there is only One who can help us in such times as I passed through then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3025/83669.html","bookId":257,"book":{"id":257,"title":"Trail-Tales of Western Canada","description":"简介： Old Ken was down on his luck.
