{"id":81812,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"Letter #3-November 18, 2006\\n\\n Dear Nikki,\\n\\n As soon as I read your letter, I had my mother check out The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn from the Collingswood Public Library. Eager to enjoy a literary book with a happy ending, I read the entire work in one sitting, which required me to forgo sleep for an evening. I don\u0027t know if Tiffany read you the parts in my diary about my black friend Danny, but this book would make him go wild, as Twain uses the n-word more than 200 times. I know this because after reading the first few chapters, I started over and kept a running tally. Every time Twain used the n-word, I made a mark on a piece of paper, and when I finished the book, there were more than 200 marks! Danny says that only black people can use the n-word, which is sort of a universal truth nowadays, so I am surprised the school board allows you to teach such a book.\\n\\n But I did like the book very much. Even though Tom Sawyer should have told Jim he was free right away, I was so happy for Jim at the end of the novel when he gained his freedom. Also, the way that Huck and Jim stuck together through bad times reminded me of Danny and Pat getting each other\u0027s backs in the bad place. What really struck me was how Huck kept struggling with the idea that God did not want him to help Jim run away, because Jim was a slave. I realize people had different values back then, and that the church and government approved of slavery, but Huck really impressed me when he said if helping free Jim meant going to hell, he would go to hell.\\n\\n When I read your letter, I cried for a long time. I know I was a bad husband, and I am not mad at you for cheating on me or leaving me or even remarrying. You deserve to be happy. And if you are married now, your getting back together with me would be a sin, because it would mean that we would be committing adultery, even though I still think of you as my wife. These thoughts make me feel dizzy, as if I am spinning out of control. These thoughts make me want to bang my fist against the little white scar above my right eyebrow, which itches every time I get confused or agitated. To use your metaphor ... since I can remember, I have been driving on a dark highway, passing endless dashes and lines. Everything else has only been a pit stop - family, Eagles, dancing, my workouts. I have been driving toward you the whole time, only desiring one thing - our reunion. And now I finally realize I\u0027m trying to woo a married woman, which I know is a sin. But I don\u0027t think you understand how hard I worked for this happy ending. I am very fit, and am now practicing being kind rather than right. I am not the man you were married to for all those lonely years. I am a better man. A man who will take you dancing and will give up sports entirely - coaching and Eagles - if that makes you happy. My conscience tells me that I should not continue to pursue these feelings, but your telling me to read Twain\u0027s novel made me think that maybe you were giving me a sign. Huck thought he shouldn\u0027t help Jim escape, but he followed his heart, he freed Jim, and that is what led to the happy ending. So maybe you are telling me in an indirect way that I should follow my heart? Why else would you specifically recommend The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to me?\\n\\n Also, our time together wasn\u0027t all bad. Maybe the end was grim, but remember the beginning? Remember college? Remember when we drove to Massachusetts in the middle of the night? It was the Friday after midterms and we were watching one of those travel shows on PBS, because we both thought we would travel back then. All our friends had gone to the rugby house for a party, but we stayed in together for a night of pizza and wine on the couch of my town house. We were watching that show about whale watching off the coast of Martha\u0027s Vineyard, and you asked me if they made wine in Martha\u0027s Vineyard. I said the New England growing season would be too short to get the proper types of grapes, but you insisted that there must be a vineyard there if the island was called Martha\u0027s Vineyard. We had this really heated fake argument - laughing and hitting each other with pillows - and then suddenly we were in my old Taurus, driving north.\\n\\n I\u0027m sure you didn\u0027t think I was really going to drive you all the way to Massachusetts without a change of clothes or toiletries, but soon we were over the Tappan Zee Bridge, and you were smiling, and I was holding your hand.\\n\\n We never made it to Martha\u0027s Vineyard, but we spent a pretty wild weekend in an economy motel just outside of Cape Cod. Do you remember walking on the beach in March? Our lovemaking smelling like decades\u0027 worth other people\u0027s cigarette smoke as we enjoyed each other over and over in that motel room? Remember how when we jumped on the mattress, smoke seemed to leak out the sides? The lobster dinner we splurged for at that cheesy restaurant called Captain Bob\u0027s, where the waiters wore eye patches?\\n\\n We always said we were going to return to Massachusetts, take the ferry, and see if Martha\u0027s Vineyard actually had vineyards. Why didn\u0027t we do this then? Probably because we had class on Monday morning. But I wish we had taken that ferry when we had the chance. What was the worst thing that could have happened? We would have missed class. It seems so silly now to drive all the way to Cape Cod with the intention of taking the ferry to Martha\u0027s Vineyard only to spend the weekend in an economy motel on the mainland.\\n\\n What I\u0027m trying to say is that maybe we can still take the ferry, Nikki. Maybe it\u0027s not too late.\\n\\n I know this is all so complicated right now. But there must be a reason that we are in contact again. There must be a reason that I lost my memory and then was filled with a vicious need to improve myself. There must be a reason if Tiffany was able to arrange this letter exchange. All I\u0027m asking is that you keep the possibility of a reunion open as we continue to communicate through our liaison.\\n\\n My therapist Cliff says he feels as though I am poised for a breakthrough, and he feels he has stabilized my violent tendencies with medications. I know that in my writings I mentioned spitting out many of my meds when I first came home, but I am taking all my pills now and can feel my mental health stabilizing. Every day I feel as though I am getting closer to regaining my memory of our demise. And no matter what I remember - no matter what really happened between us - it will not change how I feel about you. You are living with another man, you are remarried - what could be worse? I still love you. I will always love you and am only now ready to prove my love for you.\\n\\n I hope this note was concise enough, as I tried very hard to keep it under five pages and was successful. I miss you so much, Nikki. Every freckle on your beautiful nose.\\n\\n Love,\\n\\n Pat, Your Sexy Stud Muffin\\n\\n (Remember that from the wedding video?) \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-32.html","bookId":1860,"book":{"id":1860,"title":"The Silver Linings Playbook","description":"Storyline: Meet Pat Peoples.
