{"id":81788,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I Fear Him More Than Any Other Human Being\n After I returned to New Jersey, I thought I was safe, because I did not think Kenny G could leave the bad place, which I realize is silly now - because Kenny G is extremely talented and resourceful and a powerful force to be reckoned with.\n I have been sleeping in the attic because it is so ferociously hot up here. After my parents go to bed, I climb the stairs, turn off the ventilation fan, slip into my old winter sleeping bag, zipper it up so only my face is exposed, and then sweat away the pounds. Without the ventilation fan running, the temperature climbs quickly, and soon my sleeping bag is drenched with perspiration and I can feel myself getting thinner. I had done this for several nights, and nothing strange or unusual happened at all.\n But in the attic tonight I\u0027m sweating and sweating and sweating, and through the darkness, suddenly I hear the sexy synthesizer chords. I keep my eyes closed, hum a single note, and silently count to ten, knowing that I am only hallucinating like Dr. Patel said I might, but Kenny slaps me across the face, and when I open my eyes, there he is in my parents\u0027 attic, his curly mane of hair haloed like Jesus. The perfectly tanned forehead, that nose, that eternal five o\u0027clock shadow and sharp jawline. The top three buttons of his shirt are undone so that you can see a little chest hair. Mr. G might not seem evil, but I fear him more than any other human being.\n \"How? How did you find me?\" I ask him.\n Kenny G winks at me and then puts his gleaming soprano sax to his lips.\n I shiver, even though I am drenched in sweat. \"Please,\" I beg him, \"just leave me alone!\"\n But he takes a deep breath and his soprano sax starts to sing the bright notes of \"Songbird\" - and immediately I\u0027m upright in my sleeping bag, repetitively slamming the heel of my right hand into the little white scar above my right eyebrow, trying to make the music stop - Kenny G\u0027s hips are swaying right before my eyes - with every brain jolt I\u0027m yelling, \"Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!\" - the end of his instrument is in my face, pounding me with smooth jazz - I feel the blood rushing up into my forehead - Kenny G\u0027s solo has reached a climax - bang, bang, bang, bang - \n And then my mother and father are trying to restrain my arms, but I\u0027m screaming, \"Stop playing that song! Just stop! Please!\"\n When my mother gets knocked to the floor, my father kicks me hard in the stomach - which makes Kenny G vanish and kills the music - and when I fall back gasping for air, Dad jumps on my chest and punches me in the cheek, and suddenly my mom is trying to pull Dad off me and I\u0027m sobbing like a baby; my mother is screaming at my father, telling him to stop hitting me, and then he\u0027s off me and she\u0027s telling me everything is going to be okay even after my father has punched me in the face as hard as he could.\n \"That\u0027s it, Jeanie. He\u0027s going back to that hospital in the morning. First thing,\" my father says, and then stomps down the stairs.\n I can hardly think, I\u0027m sobbing so loudly.\n My mother sits down next to me and says, \"It\u0027s okay, Pat. I\u0027m here.\"\n I put my head in my mother\u0027s lap and cry myself to sleep as Mom strokes my hair.\n When I open my eyes, the ventilation fan is back on, sun is streaming through the screen in the nearest window, and Mom is still stroking my hair.\n \"How did you sleep?\" she asks me, forcing a smile. Her eyes are red and her cheeks are streaked with tears.\n For a second it feels nice to be lying next to my mom, the weight of her small hand on my head, her soft voice lingering in my ear, but soon the memory of what happened the night before forces me to sit up - and then my heart is pounding and a wave of dread courses through my limbs. \"Don\u0027t send me back to the bad place. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m so sorry. Please,\" I beg her, pleading with everything I have, because that\u0027s how much I hate the bad place and pessimistic Dr. Timbers.\n \"You\u0027re staying right here with us,\" Mom says - looking me in the eyes like she does when she is telling the truth - and then she kisses me on the cheek.\n We go down to the kitchen, where she cooks me some delicious eggs scrambled with cheese and tomatoes, and I actually swallow all of my pills because I feel I owe it to Mom after knocking her down and upsetting my father.\n I am shocked when I look at the clock and see it is already 11:00 a.m. So I start my workout as soon as my plate is clean, double-timing everything just to keep up with my routine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-7.html","bookId":1860,"book":{"id":1860,"title":"The Silver Linings Playbook","description":"Storyline: \n Meet Pat Peoples.
