{"id":81813,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Letter #4-November 29, 2006 Dear Pat, Tiffany informs me you are sincere, and from what she has told me about your new personality, it seems as though you are a completely transformed man. Whether this is the result of the accident, therapy, medication, or simply sheer willpower, you are to be congratulated, because this is no small feat. First allow me to say I recommended Huck Finn for your reading enjoyment only. I was not trying to send you a hidden message. Based on everything you have written and what Tiffany has told me - maybe you should read The Catcher in the Rye. It\u0027s about a young boy named Holden who has a hard time coping with reality. Holden wants to live in a childhood world for the rest of his life, which makes him a very beautiful and interesting character, but one who has trouble finding his place in the real world. At present, it seems as though you are having a hard time dealing with reality. Part of me thrills at the changes you have made, because your letters really do present a better man. But I also worry that this worldview you have developed is fragile, and may be what kept you in the neural health facility for so many years and is keeping you in your parents\u0027 basement for so many months. At some point you are going to have to leave the basement, Pat. You are going to have to get a job and earn money again, and then you might not be able to be the person you have been for the last few months. Of course I remember Massachusetts. We were so young, and the memory is beautiful. I\u0027ll carry it with me forever. But we WERE CHILDREN, Pat. That was more than a decade ago. I\u0027m not the type of woman who would sleep in an economy motel anymore. Maybe you have again become the type of man who would whisk a woman away to Martha\u0027s Vineyard. Maybe you are experiencing some sort of second childhood. I don\u0027t know. But I do know you will NOT be experiencing a second childhood with me. I am not a child, Pat. I\u0027m a woman who loves her current husband very much. My aim when I agreed to write you was never to allow you a second chance. My goal was not to allow you to reenter my life. I only wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye - to resolve any unresolved issues. I want to be clear about this.

Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure him a happy ending - the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent several years in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat\u0027s now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he\u0027s being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he\u0027s being haunted by Kenny G!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-silver-linings-playbook.jpg","author":"Matthew Quick","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:18 PM"}}
