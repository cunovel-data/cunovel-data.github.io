Hit the shower!\"\\n\\n In the cloud room, I pick the brown chair. We recline, and Cliff says, \"Your mother tells me you\u0027ve had quite a week. Want to talk about it?\"\\n\\n So I tell him about Veronica\u0027s dress-up party and how my old dress clothes don\u0027t fit because I have lost so much weight, and I have no swanky clothes other than the shirt my brother has recently given me, and I am pretty stressed out about going to a dinner party and wish I could just spend some time alone with Ronnie lifting weights, so that I would not have to see Veronica, who even Nikki says is a mean person.\\n\\n Dr. Patel nods a few times like he does, and then says, \"Do you like the new shirt your brother gave you? Do you feel comfortable wearing it?\"\\n\\n I tell him I absolutely love my new shirt.\\n\\n \"So wear that one to the dress-up dinner, and I\u0027m sure Veronica will like it too.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" I ask. \"Because Veronica is really particular about what you should wear to dinner parties.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" he says, which makes me feel a whole lot better.\\n\\n \"What about pants?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with the pants you have on now?\"\\n\\n I look down at the tan khakis my mom purchased for me at the Gap the other day because she says I shouldn\u0027t wear sweatpants to my doctor\u0027s appointments, and even though the pants are not as swanky as my new Eagles jersey, they do look okay, so I shrug and stop worrying about what to wear to Veronica\u0027s dinner party.\\n\\n Cliff tries to get me to talk about Kenny G, but I only close my eyes, hum a single note, and silently count to ten every time he says Mr. G\u0027s name.\\n\\n Then Cliff says he knows that I have been rough with my mother, shaking her in the kitchen and knocking her down in the attic, which makes me really sad because I love my mom so much and she rescued me from the bad place and has even signed all those legal documents - and yet I cannot rightly deny what Cliff has said. My chest heats up with guilt until I can\u0027t take it. Truth be told, I break down and cry - sobbing - for at least five minutes.\\n\\n \"Your mother is risking a lot, because she believes in you.\"\\n\\n His words make me cry even harder.\\n\\n \"You want to be a good person, don\u0027t you, Pat?\"\\n\\n I nod. I cry. I do want to be a good person. I really do.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to up your meds,\" Dr. Patel tells me. \"You might feel a little sluggish, but it should help to curb your violent outbursts. You need to know it\u0027s your actions that will make you a good person, not desire. And if you have any more episodes, I might have to recommend that you go back to the neural health facility for more intensive treatments, which - \"\\n\\n \"No. Please. I\u0027ll be good,\" I say quickly, knowing that Nikki is less likely to return if I backslide into the bad place. \"Trust me.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Dr. Patel replies with a smile. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-9.html","bookId":1860,"book":{"id":1860,"title":"The Silver Linings Playbook","description":"Storyline: Meet Pat Peoples. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure him a happy ending - the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent several years in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat\u0027s now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he\u0027s being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he\u0027s being haunted by Kenny G!\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-silver-linings-playbook.jpg","author":"Matthew Quick","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:18 PM"}}
