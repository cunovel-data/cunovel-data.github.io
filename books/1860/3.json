{"id":81784,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Orange Fire Enters My Skull\n Yes, I really do believe in silver linings, mostly because I\u0027ve been seeing them almost every day when I emerge from the basement, push my head and arms through a trash bag - so my torso will be wrapped in plastic and I will sweat more - and then go running. I always try to coordinate the ten-mile running portion of my ten-hour exercise routine with sunset, so I can finish by running west past the playing fields of Knight\u0027s Park, where, as a kid, I played baseball and soccer.\n As I run through the park, I look up and see what the day has to offer in the way of divination.\n If clouds are blocking the sun, there will always be a silver lining that reminds me to keep on trying, because I know that while things might seem dark now, my wife is coming back to me soon. Seeing the light outline those fluffy puffs of white and gray is electrifying. (And you can even re-create the effect by holding your hand a few inches away from a naked lightbulb and tracing your handprint with your eyes until you go temporarily blind.) It hurts to look at the clouds, but it also helps, like most things that cause pain. So I need to run, and as my lungs burn and my back rebels with that stabbing knife feeling and my leg muscles harden and the half inch of loose skin around my waist jiggles, I feel as though my penance for the day is being done and that maybe God will be pleased enough to lend me some help, which I think is why He has been showing me interesting clouds for the past week.\n Since my wife asked for some time apart, I\u0027ve lost more than fifty pounds, and my mother says that soon I\u0027ll be at the weight I was when I played varsity soccer in high school, which is also the weight I was when I met Nikki, and I\u0027m thinking maybe she was upset by the weight I gained during the five years we were married. Won\u0027t she be surprised to see me looking so muscular when apart time is over!\n If there are no clouds at sunset - which happened yesterday - when I look up toward the sky, orange fire enters my skull, blinds me, and that\u0027s almost as good, because it burns too and makes everything look divine.\n When I run, I always pretend I am running toward Nikki, and it makes me feel like I am decreasing the amount of time I have to wait until I see her again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-3.html","bookId":1860,"book":{"id":1860,"title":"The Silver Linings Playbook","description":"Storyline: \n Meet Pat Peoples. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure him a happy ending - the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent several years in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat\u0027s now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he\u0027s being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he\u0027s being haunted by Kenny G!\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-silver-linings-playbook.jpg","author":"Matthew Quick","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:18 PM"}}
