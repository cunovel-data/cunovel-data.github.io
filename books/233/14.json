And David heard of it, and went out against them. \n [bbe] And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over all Israel, they went up in search of David, and David, hearing of it, went out against them. \n 14:9 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 来 了 ， 布 散 在 利 乏 音 谷 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. \n [bbe] Now the Philistines had come, and had gone out in every direction in the valley of Rephaim. \n 14:10 [hgb] 大 卫 求 问 神 ， 说 ， 我 可 以 上 去 攻 打 非 利 士 人 吗 ？ 你 将 他 们 交 在 我 手 里 吗 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 可 以 上 去 ， 我 必 将 他 们 交 在 你 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. \n [bbe] And David, desiring directions from God, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? and will you give them into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up; for I will give them into your hands. \n 14:11 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 来 到 巴 力 毗 拉 心 ， 大 卫 在 那 里 杀 败 他 们 。 大 卫 说 ， 神 借 我 的 手 冲 破 敌 人 ， 如 同 水 冲 去 一 般 。 因 此 称 那 地 方 为 巴 力 毗 拉 心 。 \n [kjv] So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. \n [bbe] So they went up to Baal-perazim, and David overcame them there, and David said, God has let the forces fighting against me be broken by my hand, as a wall is broken down by rushing water; so they gave that place the name of Baal-perazim. \n 14:12 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 将 神 像 撇 在 那 里 ， 大 卫 吩 咐 人 用 火 焚 烧 了 。 \n [kjv] And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. \n [bbe] And the Philistines did not take their images with them in their flight; and at David\u0027s orders they were burned with fire. \n 14:13 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 又 布 散 在 利 乏 音 谷 。 \n [kjv] And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. \n [bbe] Then the Philistines again went out in every direction in the valley. \n 14:14 [hgb] 大 卫 又 求 问 神 。 神 说 ， 不 要 一 直 地 上 去 ， 要 转 到 他 们 后 头 ， 从 桑 林 对 面 攻 打 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. \n [bbe] And David went for directions to God; and God said to him, You are not to go up after them; but, turning away from them, come face to face with them opposite the spice-trees. \n 14:15 [hgb] 你 听 见 桑 树 梢 上 有 脚 步 的 声 音 ， 就 要 出 战 ， 因 为 神 已 经 在 你 前 头 去 攻 打 非 利 士 人 的 军 队 。 \n [kjv] And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. \n [bbe] And at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go out to the fight, for God has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines. \n 14:16 [hgb] 大 卫 就 遵 着 神 所 吩 咐 的 ， 攻 打 非 利 士 人 的 军 队 ， 从 基 遍 直 到 基 色 。 \n [kjv] David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. \n [bbe] And David did as the Lord had said; and they overcame the army of the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon as far as Gezer. \n 14:17 [hgb] 于 是 大 卫 的 名 传 扬 到 列 国 ， 耶 和 华 使 列 国 都 惧 怕 他 。 \n [kjv] And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. \n [bbe] And David\u0027s name was honoured in all lands; and the Lord put the fear of him on all nations. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/87/1513.html","bookId":233,"book":{"id":233,"title":"Chronicles历代志上","description":"简介： 亚 当 生 塞 特 。 塞 特 生 以 挪 士 。 Adam, Sheth, Enosh, 以 挪 士 生 该 南 。 该 南 生 玛 勒 列 。 玛 勒 列 生 雅 列 。 Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered, 雅 列 生 以 诺 。 以 诺 生 玛 土 撒 拉 。 玛 土 撒 拉 生 拉 麦 。 Henoch, Methusela...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/87","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
