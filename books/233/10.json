But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms, Take your sword and put it through me, before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me. But his servant, full of fear, would not do so. Then Saul took out his sword, falling on it himself. \\n\\n 10:5 [hgb] 扫 罗 就 自 己 伏 在 刀 上 死 了 。 拿 兵 器 的 人 见 扫 罗 已 死 ， 也 伏 在 刀 上 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. \\n\\n [bbe] And when his servant saw that Saul was dead, he did the same, and came to his death. \\n\\n 10:6 [hgb] 这 样 ， 扫 罗 和 他 三 个 儿 子 ， 并 他 的 全 家 都 一 同 死 亡 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. \\n\\n [bbe] So death overtook Saul and his three sons; all his family came to an end together. \\n\\n 10:7 [hgb] 住 平 原 的 以 色 列 众 人 见 以 色 列 军 兵 逃 跑 ， 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 都 死 了 ， 也 就 弃 城 逃 跑 ， 非 利 士 人 便 来 住 在 其 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. \\n\\n [bbe] And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the men of Israel had gone in flight and that Saul and his sons were dead, they went in flight away from their towns; and the Philistines came and took them for themselves. \\n\\n 10:8 [hgb] 次 日 ， 非 利 士 人 来 剥 那 被 杀 之 人 的 衣 服 ， 看 见 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 仆 倒 在 基 利 波 山 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the day after, when the Philistines came to take their goods from the dead, they saw Saul and his sons dead in Mount Gilboa. \\n\\n 10:9 [hgb] 就 剥 了 他 的 军 装 ， 割 下 他 的 首 级 ， 打 发 人 到 非 利 士 地 的 四 境 （ 到 或 作 送 到 ） 报 信 与 他 们 的 偶 像 和 众 民 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took everything off him, and took his head and his war-dress, and sent word into the land of the Philistines round about to give the news to their gods and to the people. \\n\\n 10:10 [hgb] 又 将 扫 罗 的 军 装 放 在 他 们 神 的 庙 里 ， 将 他 的 首 级 钉 在 大 衮 庙 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put his war-dress in the house of their gods, and put up his head in the house of Dagon. \\n\\n 10:11 [hgb] 基 列 雅 比 人 听 见 非 利 士 人 向 扫 罗 所 行 的 一 切 事 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, \\n\\n [bbe] And when the news came to Jabesh-gilead of what the Philistines had done to Saul, \\n\\n 10:12 [hgb] 他 们 中 间 所 有 的 勇 士 就 起 身 前 去 ， 将 扫 罗 和 他 儿 子 的 尸 身 送 到 雅 比 ， 将 他 们 的 尸 骨 葬 在 雅 比 的 橡 树 下 ， 就 禁 食 七 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. \\n\\n [bbe] All the fighting-men came up and took away Saul\u0027s body and the bodies of his sons, and took them to Jabesh, and put their bones to rest under the oak-tree in Jabesh, and took no food for seven days. \\n\\n 10:13 [hgb] 这 样 ， 扫 罗 死 了 。 因 为 他 干 犯 耶 和 华 ， 没 有 遵 守 耶 和 华 的 命 。 又 因 他 求 问 交 鬼 的 妇 人 ， \\n\\n [kjv] So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; \\n\\n [bbe] So death came to Saul because of the sin which he did against the Lord, that is, because of the word of the Lord which he kept not; and because he went for directions to one who had an evil spirit, \\n\\n 10:14 [hgb] 没 有 求 问 耶 和 华 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 使 他 被 杀 ， 把 国 归 于 耶 西 的 儿 子 大 卫 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse. \\n\\n [bbe] And not to the Lord: for this reason, he put him to death and gave the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/87/1509.html","bookId":233,"book":{"id":233,"title":"Chronicles历代志上","description":"简介： 亚 当 生 塞 特 。 塞 特 生 以 挪 士 。 Adam, Sheth, Enosh, 以 挪 士 生 该 南 。 该 南 生 玛 勒 列 。 玛 勒 列 生 雅 列 。 Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered, 雅 列 生 以 诺 。 以 诺 生 玛 土 撒 拉 。 玛 土 撒 拉 生 拉 麦 。 Henoch, Methusela...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/87","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:45 AM"}}
