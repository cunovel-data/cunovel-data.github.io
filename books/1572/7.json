{"id":110073,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"7 THURLOW SAT SMOKING HIS PIPE, HUNCHED OVER THE wheel of his parked car. His polarizing glasses lay on the seat beside him, and he stared at the evening sky through raindrops luminous on the windshield. His eyes watered and the raindrops blurred like tears. The car was a five-year-old coupe and he knew he needed a new one, but he\u0027d fallen into the habit of saving his money to buy a house ... when he\u0027d thought of marrying Ruth. The habit was difficult to break now, although he knew he clung to it mostly out of perverse hope that the past year might yet be erased from their lives. Why does she want to see me? he wondered. And why here, where we used to meet? Why such secrecy now? It had been two days since the murder and he found he still couldn\u0027t assemble the events of the period into a coherent whole. Where news stories mentioned his own involvement, those stories read like something written about a stranger -- their meaning as blurred as the raindrops in front of him now. Thurlow felt his whole world invaded by Joe Murphey\u0027s psychotic ramblings and the violent reactions of the community. It shocked Thurlow to realize that the community wanted Murphey dead. Public reaction had struck him with and the violence of the storm which had just passed. Violent storm, he thought. A violence storm. He looked up at the trees on his left, wondering how long he\u0027d been here. His watch had stopped, unwound. Ruth was late, though. It was her way. There\u0027d been the storm. Clouds had grown out of a hard gray sky with rain crouched low in them. For a time the eucalyptus grove around him had been filled with frightened bird sounds. A wind had hummed through the high boughs -- then the rain: big spattering drops. The sun was back now, low in the west, casting orange light onto the treetops. The leaves drooped with hanging raindrops. A mist near the ground quested among scaly brown trunks. Insect cries came from the roots and the bunchgrass that grew in open places along the dirt road into the grove. What do they remember of their storm? Thurlow wondered. He knew professionally why the community wanted its legal lynching, but to see the same attitude in officials, this was the shocker. Thurlow thought about the delays being placed in his path, the attempts to prevent his own professional examination of Murphey. The sheriff, district attorney George Paret, all the authorities knew by now that Thurlow had predicted the psychotic break which had cost Adele Murphey her life. If they recognized this as a fact, Murphey had to be judged insane and couldn\u0027t be executed. Paret already had shown his hand by calling in Thurlow\u0027s own department chief, the Moreno State Hospital director of psychiatry, Dr. LeRoi Whelye. Whelye was known throughout the state as a hanging psychiatrist, a man who always found what the prosecution wanted. Right on schedule, Whelye had declared Murphey to be sane and \"responsible for his acts.\" Thurlow looked at his useless wristwatch. It was stopped at 2:14. He knew it must be closer to seven now. It would be dark soon. What was keeping Ruth? Why had she asked him to meet her in their old tryst-big place? He felt suddenly contaminated by this way of meeting. Am I ashamed to see her openly now? he asked himself. Thurlow had come directly from the hospital and Whelye\u0027s unsubtle attempts to get him to step aside from this case, to forget for the moment that he was also the county\u0027s court psychologist. The words had been direct: \" ... personal involvement ... your old girlfriend ... her father ... \" The meaning was clear, but underneath lay the awareness that Whelye, too, knew about that report on Murphey which rested now in the Probation Department\u0027s files. And that report contradicted Whelye\u0027s public stand. Whelye had come up just as they were about to go into a Ward Team conference to consider the possible discharge of a patient. Thurlow thought of that conference now, sensing how it encapsulated the chief of psychiatry. They\u0027d been in the ward office with its smell of oiled floors and disinfectant -- the Protestant chaplain, a small sandy-haired man whose dark suits always seemed too large and made him appear even smaller; the ward nurse, Mrs. Norman, heavy, gray-haired, busty, a drill sergeant\u0027s rocky face with cap always set squarely on her head; Dr. Whelye, an impression of excess bulk in a tweed suit, iron gray at the temples, and in patches through his black hair, a sanitary and barber-scraped appearance to his pink cheeks, and a look of calculated reserve in his washed blue eyes. Lastly, almost something to overlook around the scarred oval table, there\u0027d been a patient: a number and a first name, Peter. He was seventeen, mentally limited by lack of the right genes, lack of opportunity, lack of education, lack of proper nutrition. He was a walking lack, blonde hair slicked down, veiled blue eyes, a narrow nose and pointed chin, a pursed- up little mouth, as though everything about him had to be shelled up inside and guarded. Outside the room had been green lawns, sunshine and patients preparing the flower beds for Spring. Inside, Thurlow felt, there had been little more than the patient\u0027s smell of fear with Whelye conducting the interview like a district attorney. \"What kind of work are you going to do when you get out?\" Whelye asked. Peter, keeping his eyes on the table, \"Sell newspapers or shine shoes, something like that.\" \"Can\u0027t make any money like that unless you have a big corner stand and then you\u0027re in big business,\" Whelye said. Watching this, Thurlow wondered why the psychiatrist would suppress ideas instead of trying to draw the boy out. He asked himself then what Whelye would do if he, Thurlow, should stop the proceedings and take the patient\u0027s place to describe \" ... a thing I saw the other night, something like a flying saucer. It was interested in a murderer.\" Mrs. Norman had Peter\u0027s social service files on the table in front of her. She leafed through them, obviously not paying much attention to Whelye. The chaplain, Hardwicke, had taken Thurlow\u0027s own psychometry file on Peter, but wasn\u0027t studying it. He seemed to be interested in the play of a sprinkler visible out the window at his right. \"Could you tell us your general attitude today, Peter?\" Whelye asked. \"How do you feel?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m all right.\" \"Are you still working in the sewing room? Seems to me you\u0027d be more interested in that kind of work outside.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m working there. I\u0027ve been working there ever since I came.\" \"How long have you been here?\" \"Pert\u0027 near two years now.\" \"How do you like it here?\" \"Oh, it\u0027s all right But I been wondering when you\u0027re going to let me out ... so I can get back home an\u0027 help support my mother.\" \"Well, that\u0027s one thing we have you in here for,\" Whelye said, \"so we can think it over.\" \"Well, that\u0027s what they been telling me for six months, now,\" Peter said. \"Why do I have to stay here? The chaplain\" (Peter shot a covert glance at Hardwicke) \"told me you were going to write my mother to see if she wanted me home. An\u0027 if she did want me home, he\u0027d take me down there.\" \"We haven\u0027t heard from your mother yet.\" \"Well, I got a letter from my mother an\u0027 she says she wants me home. The chaplain said if you\u0027d let me go he\u0027d take me home. So I don\u0027t see any reason why I can\u0027t go.\" \"It\u0027s not a simple decision, Peter. It\u0027s not just the chaplain\u0027s decision.\" Hardwicke opened the psychometry file, made a pretense of studying it. Thurlow sighed, shook his head. What was that thing I saw? Thurlow wondered. Was it real there beside Murphey\u0027s window? Was it illusion? The question had been plaguing him for two days. \"Well, he said he\u0027d take me,\" Peter said. Whelye stared at Hardwicke, disapproval on his face. \"Did you say you\u0027d take him down to Mariposa?\" \"If he were discharged,\" Hardwicke said. \"I said I\u0027d be glad to give him the trip down there.\" Whelye faced Peter, said: \"Well, we have to do some more looking into this matter, generally to find out if your mother wants you and if the chaplain\u0027s schedule will allow him to take you down there. If all these things work out, we\u0027ll let you go.\" Peter was sitting very still now, no emotion on his face, his gaze intent upon his hands. \"Thank you.\" \"That\u0027s all, Peter,\" Whelye said. \"You can go now.\" Mrs. Norman signaled an attendant waiting at the screened window to the Common Room. The attendant opened the door. Peter got up and hurried out. Thurlow sat for a moment, the realization growing in him that Peter had taken away what amounted to a promise to be released, but that because of the way he had conducted the conference, Dr. Whelye wasn\u0027t aware of this. Whelye would be thinking that all the \"ifs\" involved made this a hypothetical case. \"Well, Dr. Whelye,\" Thurlow said, \"you\u0027ve made a definite commitment to this patient to discharge him -- promptly.\" \"Oh, no -- I didn\u0027t promise I\u0027d discharge him.\" \"Well, the patient certainly understood he\u0027d be home in short order -- and the only qualifications are Chaplain Hardwicke\u0027s schedule and confirmation of the mother\u0027s letter.\" \"Call the patient back and well settle this with him right now.\" Whelye said. He looked angry. Mrs. Norman sighed, went to the Common Room door, signaled an attendant. Peter was brought back and returned to his chair. The boy kept his eyes down, shoulders bent, unmoving. \"You understand, don\u0027t you, Peter,\" Whelye asked, \"that we haven\u0027t made any definite promise to discharge you? We\u0027re going to look into your home situation and see if everything is all right and if you can get a job. We\u0027d also like to look into the possibility of you returning to school for a year or so. Perhaps you could get a better job. You understand, don\u0027t you, that we aren\u0027t making any definite commitment?\" \"Yeah, I understand.\" Peter looked at Chaplain Hardwicke who refused to meet the boy\u0027s gaze. \"What\u0027s this about school?\" Thurlow asked. \"The boy hasn\u0027t finished high school,\" Whelye said. He faced Peter. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to go back and finish high school?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Do you like to go to school?\" Whelye asked. \"Yeah.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to finish your education and get a job where you could pay your own way and save money and get married?\" \"Yeah.\" Whelye glanced triumphantly at Thurlow. \"Anybody got any questions?\" Thurlow had slowly been building up in his mind the analogy of a stud poker game. Peter was in the position of a player who didn\u0027t believe anything happening here, nor did he disbelieve anything. He was waiting to see the rest of the cards. \"Isn\u0027t it true, Peter,\" Thurlow asked, \"that you\u0027d rather be hungry than on a full stomach?\" \"Yeah.\" The boy had turned his attention to Whelye now. \"Isn\u0027t it true, Peter,\" Thurlow asked, \"that you\u0027d rather eat a dry crust of bread than have a nice juicy piece of meat on your dinner plate?\" \"Yeah.\" \"That\u0027s all,\" Thurlow said. At Mrs. Norman\u0027s signal, the attendant took Peter once more from the room. \"I think when we get to the next patient,\" Thurlow said, \"we should swear him in like they do in court.\" Whelye remained silent for a moment. He shuffled his papers, then: \"I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re driving at.\" \"You reminded me of a district attorney of my acquaintance,\" Thurlow said. \"Oh?\" Whelye\u0027s eyes glazed with anger. \"By the way,\" Thurlow said, \"do you believe in flying saucers?\" The heads of both Mrs. Norman and Chaplain Hardwicke snapped up. They stared at Thurlow. Whelye, however, drew back, his eyes veiled, watchful. \"What is the meaning of that question?\" Whelye demanded. \"I\u0027d like to know your position,\" Thurlow said. \"On flying saucers?\" There was a cautious disbelief in Whelye\u0027s tone. \"Yes.\" \"They\u0027re delusional material,\" Whelye said. \"Utter nonsense. Oh, there could be a few cases of mistaken identity, weather balloons and that sort of thing, but the people who insist they\u0027ve seen spaceships, these people are in need of our services.\" \"A sound opinion,\" Thurlow said. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it\" Whelye nodded. \"I don\u0027t care what you think of my methods,\" he said, \"but you\u0027re not going to find my opinions based on delusional material -- of any type. Is that clear?\" \"Quite clear,\" Thurlow said. He saw that Whelye was convinced the question had carried a subtle intent to discredit Whelye got to his feet, glanced at his watch. \"I fail to see the point in all this, but doubtless you had some idea in mind.\" He left the room. Mrs. Norman took a deep breath, bent a look of sympathy on Thurlow. \"You like to play with fire, evidently,\" she said. Thurlow stood up, smiled. Hardwicke, catching Thurlow\u0027s eyes, said: \"The defense rests.\" As the scene passed through his mind, Thurlow shook his head. Again, he glanced at his wristwatch, smiled at himself as the unconscious gesture displayed the stopped hands. The air coming in the car window smelled of wet leaves. Why did Ruth ask me to meet her here? She\u0027s another man\u0027s wife now. Where is she -- so damned late! Could something have happened to her? He looked at his pipe. Damn pipe\u0027s gone out. Always going out. I smoke matches, not tobacco. Hate to burn myself with this woman again. Poor Ruth -- tragedy, tragedy. She was very close to her mother. He tried to remember the murdered woman. Adele Murphey was photographs and descriptions in stories now, a reflection from the words of witnesses and police. The Adele Murphey he\u0027d known refused to come out from behind the brutal new images. Her features were beginning to grow dim in the leaf whirl of things that fade. His mind held only the police pictures now -- color photos in the file at the sheriff\u0027s office -- the red hair (so much like the daughter\u0027s) fanned out on an oil-stained driveway. Her bloodless skin in the photo -- he remembered that. And he remembered the words of the witness, Sarah French, the doctor\u0027s wife from next door, words on a deposition. Through Mrs. French\u0027s words, he could almost visualize that violent scene. Sarah French had heard shouting, a scream. She\u0027d looked out of her second floor bedroom window onto moon-flooded night just in time to see the murder. \"Adele ... Mrs. Murphey came running out of her back door. She was wearing a green nightgown ... very thin. She was barefooted. I remember thinking how odd: she\u0027s barefooted. Then Joe was right behind her. He had that damned Malay kriss. It looked horrible, horrible. I could see his face ... the moonlight. He looked like he always looks when he\u0027s angry. He has such a terrible temper!\" Sarah\u0027s words -- Sarah\u0027s words ... Thurlow could almost see that zigzag blade glinting in Joe Murphey\u0027s hand, a vicious, shivering, wavering thing in the mottled shadows. It had taken Joe no more than ten steps to catch his wife. Sarah had counted the blows. \"I just stood there counting each time he struck her. I don\u0027t know why. I just counted. Seven times. Seven times.\" Adele had sprawled onto the concrete, her hair spreading in that uneven splash which the cameras later recorded. Her knees had drawn up into a fetal curve, then straightened. And all that time, the doctor\u0027s wife had been standing there at the upstairs window, left hand to mouth, her flesh a rigid, mortal concrete. \"I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t even speak. All I could do was just watch him.\" Joe Murphey\u0027s oddly thin-wristed right hand had come up, hurled the kriss in a short arc onto the lawn. Unhurriedly, he had walked around his wife\u0027s body, avoided the spreading patch of red that trailed down the concrete. Presently, he\u0027d merged with the shadows of trees where the driveway entered the street. Sarah had heard a car motor start Its lights had flashed on. The car had roared away in a gritty scattering of gravel. Then, and only then, Sarah had found she could move. She\u0027d called an ambulance. \"Andy?\" The voice brought Thurlow back from a far distance. Ruth\u0027s voice? he wondered. He turned. She stood at his left just behind the car, a slender woman in a black silk suit that smoothed her full curves. Her red hair, usually worn close around her oval face, was tied in a severe coil at the back of her neck. The hair bound so tightly -- Thurlow tried to put out of his mind all memory of the mother\u0027s hair spread on the driveway. Ruth\u0027s green eyes stared at him with a look of hurt expectancy. She had the appearance of a tired elf. Thurlow opened his door, slipped out to the wet grass beside the road. \"I didn\u0027t hear your car,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve been staying with Sarah, living with her. I walked up from the house. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so late.\" He could hear the tears in her voice and wondered at the inanity of their conversation. \"Ruth ... damn it all! I don\u0027t know what to say.\" Without thinking about it, he crossed to her, took her in his arms. He could feel her muscles resisting him. \"I don\u0027t know what to say.\" She pulled out of his embrace. \"Then ... don\u0027t say anything. It\u0027s all been said anyway.\" She looked up at his eyes. \"Aren\u0027t you still wearing your special glasses?\" \"To hell with my glasses. Why wouldn\u0027t you speak to me on the phone? Was that Sarah\u0027s number they gave me at the hospital?\" Her words were coming back to him, \" ... living with her.\" What did it mean? \"Father said ... \" She bit her lower lip, shook her head. \"Andy, oh, Andy, he\u0027s insane and they\u0027re going to execute him ... \" She looked up at Thurlow, her lashes wet with tears. \"Andy, I don\u0027t know how to feel about him. I don\u0027t know ... \" Again, he took her in his arms. She came willingly this time. How familiar and right it felt for her to be there. She began to sob gently against his shoulder. Her crying felt like the spent aftermath of sorrow. \"Oh, I wish you could take me away from here,\" she whispered. What was she saying? he asked himself. She was no longer Ruth Murphey. She was Mrs. Neville Hudson. He wanted to push her away, start throwing questions at her. But that wouldn\u0027t be professional, not the right psychological thing to do. He decided it wasn\u0027t what he wanted to do after all. Still, she was another man\u0027s wife. Damn! Damn! Damn! What had happened? The fight. He remembered their fight -- the night he\u0027d told her about the fellowship grant. She hadn\u0027t wanted him to take it, to be separated for a year. Denver had sounded so far away in her words. \"It\u0027s only a year.\" He could hear his own voice saying it. \"You think more of your damn career than you do of me!\" The temper matched her hair. He\u0027d left on that sour note. His letters had gone into a void -- unanswered. She\u0027d been \"not home\" to his telephone calls. And he\u0027d learned he could be angry, too -- and hurt. But what had really happened? Again, she said: \"I don\u0027t know how to feel about him.\" \"What can I do to help?\" It was all he could say, but the words felt inadequate. She pushed away from him. \"Anthony Bondelli, the attorney -- we\u0027ve hired him. He wants to talk to you. I ... I told him about your report on ... father -- the time he turned in the false fire alarm.\" Her face crumpled. \"Oh, Andy -- why did you go away? I needed you. We needed you.\" \"Ruth ... your father wouldn\u0027t take any help from me.\" \"I know. He hated you ... because of ... what you said. But he still needed you.\" \"Nobody listened to me, Ruth. He was too important a man for ... \" \"Bondelli thinks you can help with the insanity plea. He asked me to see you, to ... \" She shrugged, pulled a handkerchief from her pocket, wiped her cheeks. So that\u0027s it, Thurlow thought. She\u0027s making up to me to get my help, buying my help! He turned away to hide his sudden anger and the pain. For a moment, his eyes didn\u0027t focus, then he grew aware (quite slowly, it seemed) of a subtle brownian movement at the edge of the grove. It was like a swarm of gnats, but unlike them too. His glasses. Where were his glasses? In the car! The gnats dissolved away upward. Their retreat coincided with the lifting of an odd pressure from his senses, as though a sound or something like a sound had been wearing on his nerves, but now was gone. \"You will help?\" Ruth asked. Was that the same sort of thing I saw at Murphey\u0027s window? Thurlow asked himself. What is it? Ruth took a step nearer, looked up at his profile. \"Bondelli thought -- because of us -- you might ... hesitate.\" The damned pleading in her voice! His mind replayed her question. He said: \"Yes, I\u0027ll help any way I can.\" \"That man ... in the jail is just a shell,\" she said. Her voice was low, flat, almost without expression. He looked down at her, seeing how her features drew inward as she spoke. \"He\u0027s not my father. He just looks like my father. My father\u0027s dead. He\u0027s been dead ... for a long time. We didn\u0027t realize it ... that\u0027s all.\" God! How pitiful she looked! \"I\u0027ll do everything I can,\" he said, \"but ... \" \"I know there isn\u0027t much hope,\" she said. \"I know how they feel -- the people. It was my mother this man killed.\" \"People sense he\u0027s insane,\" Thurlow said, his voice unconsciously taking a pedantic tone. \"They know it from the way he talks -- from what he did. Insanity is, unfortunately, a communicable disease. He\u0027s aroused a counter-insanity. He\u0027s an irritant the community wants removed. He raises questions about themselves that people can\u0027t answer.\" \"We shouldn\u0027t be talking about him,\" she said. \"Not here.\" She looked around the grove. \"But I have to talk about him -- or go crazy.\" \"That\u0027s quite natural,\" he said, his voice carefully soothing. \"The disturbance he created, the community disturbance is ... Damn it! Words are so stupid sometimes!\" \"I know,\" she said. \"I can take the clinical approach, too. If my ... if that man in the jail should be judged insane and sent to a mental hospital, people\u0027d have to ask themselves very disturbing questions.\" \"Can a person appear sane when he\u0027s really insane?\" Thurlow said. \"Can a man be insane when he thinks he\u0027s sane? Could I be insane enough to do the things this man did?\" \"I\u0027m through crying now,\" she said. She glanced up at Thurlow, looked away. \"The daughter\u0027s had her fill of ... sorrow. I ... \" She took a deep breath. \"I can ... hate ... for the way my mother died. But I\u0027m still a psychiatric nurse and I know all the professional cant. None of it helps the daughter much. It\u0027s odd -- as though I were more than one person.\" Again, she looked up at Thurlow, her expression open, without any defenses. \"And I can run to the man I love and ask him to take me away from here because I\u0027m afraid ... deathly afraid.\" The man I love! Her words seared his mind. He shook his head. \"But ... what about ... \" \"Nev?\" How bitter she made the name sound. \"I haven\u0027t lived with Nev for three months now. I\u0027ve been staying with Sarah French. Nev ... Nev was a hideous mistake. That grasping little man!\" Thurlow found his throat was tight with suppressed emotion. He coughed, looked up at the darkening sky, said: \"It\u0027ll be dark in a few minutes.\" How stupidly inane the words sounded! She put a hand on his arm. \"Andy, oh Andy, what\u0027ve I done to us?\" She came into his arms very gently. He stroked her hair. \"We\u0027re still here,\" he said. \"We\u0027re still us.\" Ruth looked up at him. \"The trouble with that man in the jail is he has a sane type of delusion.\" Tears were running down her cheeks, but her voice remained steady. \"He thinks my mother was unfaithful to him. Lots of men worry about that. I imagine ... even ... Nev could worry about that\" A sudden gust of wind shook raindrops off the leaves, spattering them. Ruth freed herself from his arms. \"Let\u0027s walk out to the point.\" \"In the dark?\" \"We know the way. Besides, the riding club has lights there now. You see them every night across the valley from the hospital. They\u0027re automatic.\" \"It\u0027s liable to rain.\" \"Then it won\u0027t matter if I cry. My cheeks\u0027ll already be wet.\" \"Ruth ... honey ... I ... \" \"Just take me for a walk the way ... we used to.\" Still he hesitated. There was something frightening about the grove ... pressure, an almost sound. He stepped to the car, reached in and found his glasses. He slipped them on, looked around-nothing. No gnats, not a sign of anything odd -- except the pressure. \"You won\u0027t need your glasses,\" Ruth said. She took his arm. Thurlow found he couldn\u0027t speak past a sudden ache in his throat. He tried to analyze his fear. It wasn\u0027t a personal thing. He decided he was afraid for Ruth. \"Come on,\" she said. He allowed her to lead him across the grass toward the bridle path. Darkness came like a sharp demarcation as they emerged from the eucalyptus grove onto the first rise up through pines and buckeyes that hemmed the riding club\u0027s trail. Widely spaced night-riding lights attached to the trees came on with a wet glimmering through drenched leaves. In spite of the afternoon\u0027s rain, the duff-packed trail felt firm underfoot. \"We\u0027ll have the trail to ourselves tonight,\" Ruth said. \"No one\u0027ll be out because of the rain.\" She squeezed his arm. But we don\u0027t have it to ourselves, Thurlow thought. He could feel a presence with them -- a hovering something ... watchful, dangerous. He looked down at Ruth. The top of her head came just above his shoulder. The red hair glinted wetly in the dim overhead light. There was a feeling of damp silence around them -- and that odd sense of pressure. The packed duff of the trail absorbed their footfalls with barely a sound. This is a crazy feeling, he thought. If a patient described this to me, I\u0027d begin probing immediately for the source of the delusional material. \"I used to walk lip here when I was a child,\" Ruth said. \"That was before they put in the lights for the night parties. I hated it when they put in the lights.\" \"You walked here in the dark?\" he asked. \"Yes. I never told you that, did I?\" \"No.\" \"The air feels clear after the rain.\" She took a deep breath. \"Didn\u0027t your parents object? How old were you?\" \"About eleven, I guess. My parents didn\u0027t know. They were always so busy with parties and things.\" The bridle path diverged at a small glade with a dark path leading off to the left through an opening in a rock retaining wall. They went through the gap, down a short flight of steps and onto the tarred top of an elevated water storage tank. Below them the city\u0027s lights spread wet velvet jewels across the night. The lights cast an orange glow against low hanging clouds. Now, Thurlow could feel the odd pressure intensely. He looked up and around -- nothing. He glanced down at the pale grayness of Ruth\u0027s face. \"When we got here you used to say: \u0027May I kiss you?\u0027\" she said. \"And I used to say: \u0027I was hoping you\u0027d ask.\u0027\" Ruth turned, pressed against him, lifted her face. His fears, the vague pressure, all were forgotten as he bent to kiss her. It seemed for a moment that time had moved backward, that Denver, Nev --none of these things had happened. But the warmth of her kiss, the demanding way her body pressed against him --these filled him with a mounting astonishment. He pulled away. \"Ruth, I ... \" She put a finger against his lips. \"Don\u0027t say it.\" Then: \"Andy, didn\u0027t you ever want to go to a motel with me?\" \"Hell! Lots of times, but ... \" \"You\u0027ve never made a real pass at me.\" He felt that she was laughing at him and this brought anger into his voice. \"I was in love with you!\" \"I know,\" she whispered. \"I didn\u0027t want just a roll in the hay. I wanted ... well, dammit, I wanted to mate with you, have children, the whole schmoo.\" \"What a fool I was,\" she whispered. \"Honey, what\u0027re you going to do? Are you going to get ... a ... \" He hesitated. \"A divorce?\" she asked. \"Of course --afterward.\" \"After the ... trial.\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s the trouble with a small town,\" he said. \"Everyone knows everyone else\u0027s business even when it\u0027s none of their business.\" \"For a psychologist, that\u0027s a very involved sentence,\" she said. She snuggled against him and they stood there silently while Thurlow remembered the vague pressure and probed for it in his mind as though it were a sore tooth. Yes, it was still there. When he relaxed his guard, a deep disquiet filled him. \"I keep thinking about my mother,\" Ruth said. \"Oh?\" \"She loved my father, too.\" Coldness settled in his stomach. He started to speak, remained silent as his eyes detected movement against the orange glow of clouds directly in front of him. An object settled out of the clouds and came to a hovering stop about a hundred yards away and slightly above their water-tank vantage point. Thurlow could define the thing\u0027s shape against the background glow --four shimmering tubular legs beneath a fluorescing green dome. A rainbow circle of light whirled around the base of each leg. \"Andy! You\u0027re hurting me!\" He realized he had locked his arms around her in a spasm of shock. Slowly, he released his grip. \"Turn around,\" he whispered. \"Tell me what you see out there against the clouds.\" She gave him a puzzled frown, turned to peer out toward the city. \"Where?\" \"Slightly above us --straight ahead against the clouds.\" \"I don\u0027t see anything.\" The object began drifting nearer. Thurlow could distinguish figures behind the green dome. They moved in a dim, phosphorescent light. The rainbow glow beneath the thing\u0027s tubular legs began to fade. \"What\u0027re you looking at?\" Ruth asked. \"What is it?\" He felt her trembling beneath his hand on her shoulder. \"Right there,\" he said, pointing. \"Look, right there.\" She bent to stare along his arm. \"I don\u0027t see a thing --just clouds.\" He wrenched off his glasses. \"Here. Look through these.\" Even without the glasses, Thurlow could see the thing\u0027s outline. It. coasted along the edge of the hill-nearer ... nearer. Ruth put on the glasses, looked where he pointed. \"I ... a dark blur of some kind,\" she said. \"It looks like ... smoke or a cloud ... or ... insects. Is it a swarm of insects?\" Thurlow\u0027s mouth felt dry. There was a painful constricting sensation in his throat. He reclaimed his glasses, looked at the drifting object. The figures inside were quite distinct now. He counted five of them, the great staring eyes all focused on him. \"Andy! What is it you see?\" \"You\u0027re going to think I\u0027m nuts.\" \"What is it?\" He took a deep breath, described the object \"Five men in it?\" \"Perhaps they\u0027re men, but they\u0027re very small. They look no more than three feet tall.\" \"Andy, you\u0027re frightening me. Why are you frightening me?\" \"I\u0027m frightening myself.\" She pressed back into his arms. \"Are you sure you see this ... this ... I can\u0027t see a thing.\" \"I see them as plainly as I see you. If it\u0027s illusion, it\u0027s a most complete illusion.\" The rainbow glow beneath the tubular legs had become a dull blue. The object settled lower, lower, came to a hovering stop about fifteen yards away and level with them. \"Maybe it\u0027s a new kind of helicopter,\" Ruth said. \"Or ... Andy, I still can\u0027t see it.\" \"Describe what you see ... \" He pointed \" ... right there.\" \"A little mistiness. It looks like it\u0027s going to rain again.\" \"They\u0027re working with a square machine of some kind,\" he said. \"It has what look like short antennae. The antennae glow. They\u0027re pointing it at us.\" \"Andy, I\u0027m scared.\" She was shivering in his arms. \"I ... think we\u0027d better get out of here,\" he said. He willed himself to leave, found he couldn\u0027t move. \"I ... can\u0027t ... move,\" Ruth whispered. He could hear her teeth chattering, but his own body felt frozen in dull cement. \"Andy, I can\u0027t move!\" There was hysteria in her voice. \"Is it still there?\" \"They\u0027re pointing some device at us,\" he husked. His voice felt as- though it came from far away, from another person. \"They\u0027re doing this to us. Are you sure you can\u0027t see anything?\" \"Nothing! A misty little cloud, nothing else.\" Thurlow felt suddenly that she was just being obstinate. Anyone could see the thing right there in front of them! Intense anger at her surged through him. Why wouldn\u0027t she admit she saw it? Right there! He hated her for being so obstinate. The irrational abruptness of the emotion asserted itself in his awareness. He began to question his own reaction. How could I feel hate for Ruth? I love her. As though this thought freed him, Thurlow found he could move his legs. He began backing away, dragging Ruth with him. She was a heavy, unmoving weight. Her feet scraped against the gravel in the tank\u0027s surface. His movement set off a flurry of activity among the creatures beneath the green dome. They buzzed and fussed over their square machine. A painful constriction seized Thurlow\u0027s chest. Each breath took a laboring concentration. Still, he continued backing away dragging Ruth with him. She sagged in his arms now. His foot encountered a step and he almost fell. Slowly, he began inching backward up the steps. Ruth was a dead weight. \"Andy,\" she gasped. \"Can\u0027t ... breathe.\" \"Hold ... on,\" he rasped. They were at the top of the steps now, then back through the gap in the stone wall. Movement became somewhat easier, although he could still see the domed object hovering beyond the water storage tank. The glowing antennae remained pointed at him. Ruth began to move her legs. She turned, and they hobbled together onto the bridle path. Each step grew easier. Thurlow could hear her taking deep, sighing breaths. Abruptly, as though a weight had been lifted from them, they regained full use of their muscles. They turned. \"It\u0027s gone,\" Thurlow said. She reacted with an anger that astonished him. \"What were you trying to pull back there, Andy Thurlow? Frightening me half out of my wits!\" \"I saw what I told you I saw,\" he said. \"You may not\u0027ve seen it, but you certainly felt it\" \"Hysterical paralysis,\" she said. \"It gripped us both at the same instant and left us both at the same instant,\" he said. \"Why not?\" \"Ruth, I saw exactly what I described.\" \"Flying saucers!\" she sneered. \"No ... well, maybe. But it was there!\" He was angry now, defensive. A rational part of him saw how insane the past few minutes had been. Could it have been illusion? No! He shook his head. \"Honey, I saw ... \" \"Don\u0027t you honey me!\" He grabbed her shoulders, shook her. \"Ruth! Two minutes ago you were saying you love me. Can you turn it off just like that?\" \"I ... \" \"Does somebody want you to hate me?\" \"What?\" She stared up at him, her face dim in the tree lights. \"Back there ... \" He nodded toward the tank. \"I felt myself angry with you ... hating you. I told myself I couldn\u0027t hate you. I love you. That\u0027s when I found I could move. But when I felt the ... hate, the instant I felt it, that was exactly when they pointed their machine at us.\" \"What machine?\" \"Some kind of box with glowing rods or antennae sticking out of it.\" \"Are you trying to tell me that those nutty ... whatever could make you feel hate ... or ... \" \"That\u0027s how it felt.\" \"That\u0027s the craziest thing I ever heard!\" She backed away from him. \"I know it\u0027s crazy, but that\u0027s how it felt.\" He reached for her arm. \"Let\u0027s get back to the car.\" Ruth pulled away. \"I\u0027m not going a step with you until you explain what happened out there.\" \"I can\u0027t explain it.\" \"How could you see it when I couldn\u0027t?\" \"Maybe the accident ... my eyes, the polarizing \"Are you sure that accident at the radlab didn\u0027t injure more than your eyes?\" He suppressed a surge of anger. It was so easy to feel angry. With some difficulty, he held his voice level. \"They had me on the artificial kidney for a week and with every test known to God and man. The burst altered the ion exchange system in the cones of my retinas. That\u0027s all. And it isn\u0027t permanent. But I think whatever happened to my eyes, that\u0027s why I can see these things. I\u0027m not supposed to see them, but I can.\" Again, he reached for her, captured her arm. Half dragging her, he set off down the path. She fell into step beside him. \"But what could they be?\" she asked. \"I don\u0027t know, but they\u0027re real. Trust me, Ruth. Trust that much. They\u0027re real.\" He knew he was begging and hated himself for it, but Ruth moved closer, tucked her arm under his. \"All right, darling, I trust you. You saw what you saw. What\u0027re you going to do about it?\" They came off the trail and into the eucalyptus grove. The car was a darker shape among shadows. Thurlow drew her to a stop beside it. \"How hard is it to believe me?\" he asked. She was silent for a moment, then: \"It\u0027s ... difficult.\" \"Okay,\" he said. \"Kiss me.\" \"What?\" \"Kiss me. Let\u0027s see if you really hate me.\" \"Andy, you\u0027re being ... \" \"Are you afraid to kiss me?\" \"Of course not!\" \"Okay then.\" He pulled her to him. Their lips met. For an instant, he sensed resistance, then she melted into his embrace, her arms creeping behind his neck. Presently, he drew away. \"If that\u0027s hate, I want lots of it,\" he said. \"Me, too.\" Again, she pressed herself against him. Thurlow felt his blood pounding. He pulled away with an abrupt, defensive motion. \"Sometimes I wish you weren\u0027t so damned Victorian,\" she said. \"But maybe I wouldn\u0027t love you then.\" He brushed a strand of the red hair away from her cheek. How faintly glowing her face looked in the light from the bridle trail lamps behind him. \"I think I\u0027d better take you home ... to Sarah.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to take me home.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to go home.\" \"But I\u0027d better?\" \"You\u0027d better.\" She put her hands against his chest, pushed away. They got into the car, moving with a sudden swift embarrassment. Thurlow started the engine, concentrated on backing to the turn-around. The headlights picked out lines of crusty brown bark on the trees. Abruptly, the headlights went dark. The engine died with a gasping cough. A breathless, oppressive sensation seized him. \"Andy!\" Ruth said. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Thurlow forced himself to turn to the left, wondering how he knew where to look. There were four rainbow glows close to the ground, the tubular legs and the green dome just outside the grove. The thing hovered there, silent, menacing. \"They\u0027re back,\" he whispered. \"Right there.\" He pointed. \"Andy ... Andy, I\u0027m frightened.\" She huddled against him. \"No matter what happens, you don\u0027t hate me,\" he said. \"You love me. Remember that. You love me. Keep it in your mind.\" \"I love you.\" Her voice was faint. A directionless sense of anger began to fill Thurlow. It had no object at first. Just anger. Then he could actually feel it trying to point at Ruth. \"I ... want to ... hate you,\" she whispered. \"You love me,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t forget that.\" \"I love you. Oh, Andy, I love you. I don\u0027t want to hate you ... I love you.\" Thurlow lifted a fist, shook it at the green dome. \"Hate them,\" he rasped. \"Hate bastards who\u0027d try to manipulate us that way.\" He could feel her shaking and trembling against his shoulder. \"I ... hate ... them,\" she said. \"Now, do you believe me?\" \"Yes! Yes, I believe you!\" \"Could the car have hysterical paralysis?\" \"No. Oh, Andy, I couldn\u0027t just turn on hate against you. I couldn\u0027t.\" His arm ached where she clutched it \"What are they? My God! What is it?\" \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re human,\" Thurlow said. \"What\u0027re we going to do?\" \"Anything we can.\" The rainbow circles beneath the dome shifted into the blue, then violet and into the red. The thing began to lift away from the grove. It receded into the darkness. With it went the sense of oppression. \"It\u0027s gone, isn\u0027t it?\" Ruth whispered. \"It\u0027s gone.\" \"Your lights are on,\" she said. He looked down at the dash lights, out at the twin cones of the headlights stabbing into the grove. He recalled the shape of the thing then --like a giant spider ready to pounce on them. He shuddered. What were the creatures in that ominous machine? Like a giant spider. His mind dredged up a memory out of childhood: Oberorn\u0027s palace has walls of spider\u0027s legs. Were they faerie, the huldu-folk? Where did the myths originate? he wondered. He could feel his mind questing down old paths and he remembered a verse from those days of innocence. \"See ye not yon bonny road That winds about yon fernie brae? That is the road to fair Elfland. Where thou and I this night maun gae.\" \"Hadn\u0027t we better go?\" Ruth asked. He started the engine, his hands moving automatically through the kinesthetic pattern. \"It stopped the motor and turned off the lights,\" Ruth said. \"Why would they do that?\" They! he thought. No doubts now. He headed the car out of the grove down the hill toward Moreno Drive. \"What\u0027re we going to do?\" Ruth asked. \"Can we do anything?\" \"If we talk about it, people\u0027ll say we\u0027re crazy. Besides ... the two of us ... up here ... \" We\u0027re neatly boxed, he thought. And he imagined what Whelye would say to a recountal of this night\u0027s experiences. \"You were with another man\u0027s wife, you say? Could guilt feelings have brought on this shared delusion?\" And if this met with protests and further suggestions, \"Faerie folk? My dear Thurlow, do you feel well?\" Ruth leaned against him. \"Andy, if they could make us hate, could they make us love?\" He swerved the car over to the shoulder of the road, turned off the motor, set the handbrake, extinguished the lights. \"They\u0027re not here right now.\" \"How do we know?\" He stared around at the night --blackness, not even starlight under those clouds ... no glow of weird object --but beyond the trees bordering the road ... what? Could they make us love? Damn her for asking such a question! Not I mustn\u0027t damn her. I must love her ... I ... must. \"Andy? What\u0027re you doing?\" \"Thinking.\" \"Andy, I still find this whole thing so unreal. Couldn\u0027t there be some other explanation? I mean, your motor stopping ... Motors do stop; lights go out. Don\u0027t they?\" \"What do you want from me?\" he asked. \"Do you want me to say yes, I\u0027m nuts, I\u0027m deluded. I\u0027m ... \" She put a hand over his mouth. \"What I want is for you to make love to me and never stop.\" He started to put an arm around her, but she pushed him away. \"No. When that happens, I want to know it\u0027s us making love, not someone forcing us.\" Damn her practicality! he thought. Then: No! I love her ... but is it me loving her? Is it my own doing? \"Andy? There is something you can do for me.\" \"What?\" \"The house on Manchester Avenue ... where Nev and I were living --there\u0027re some things I want from there, but I\u0027ve been afraid to go over there alone. Would you take me?\" \"Now?\" \"It\u0027s early yet. Nev may still be down at the plant My ... father made him assistant manager, you know. Hasn\u0027t anyone told you that\u0027s why he married me? To get the business.\" Thurlow put a hand on her arm. \"You want him to know ... about us?\" \"What\u0027s there to know?\" He returned his hand to the steering wheel. \"Okay, darling. As you say.\" Again, he started the motor, pulled the car onto the road. They drove in silence. The tires hissed against wet pavement. Other cars passed, their lights glaring. Thurlow adjusted the polarizing lenses. It was a delicate thing --to give him enough visibility but prevent the pain of sudden light. Presently, Ruth said: \"I don\u0027t want any trouble, a fight. You wait for me in the car. If I need help, I\u0027ll call.\" \"You\u0027re sure you don\u0027t want me to go in with you?\" \"He won\u0027t try anything if he knows you\u0027re there.\" He shrugged. She was probably right. Certainly, she must know Nev Hudson\u0027s character by now. But Thurlow still felt a nagging sensation of suspended judgment. He suspected the events of the past few days, even the menacing encounter of this night, made some odd kind of sense. \"Why did I marry him?\" Ruth asked. \"I keep asking myself. God knows. I don\u0027t. It just seemed to come to the point where ... \" She shrugged. \"After tonight, I wonder if any of us knows why we do what we do.\" She looked up at Thurlow. \"Why is this happening, darling?\" That\u0027s it, Thurlow thought. There\u0027s the sixty-four dollar question. It\u0027s not who are these creatures? It\u0027s ... what do they want? Why are they interfering in our lives?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-7.html","bookId":1572,"book":{"id":1572,"title":"The Heaven Makers","description":"Storyline: The Heaven Makers is set on contemporary Earth with the one difference that we are being watched and manipulated by aliens for their viewing pleasure.
