Back and forth, back and forth she went, her green robe hissing against her legs. She did this almost every time he came here now-unless he set the manipulator at a disgustingly high pressure.\\n\\n His eyes moved to follow the pacing. Her robe was belted at the waist with emeralds chained in silver that glittered under the room\u0027s yellow light. Her body gave definite visible hints of her pregnancy --a mounding of the abdomen, a rich glow to her skin. She knew her condition, of course, but aside from one outburst of hysterics (which the manipulator controlled quickly) she made no mention of it.\\n\\n Only ten rest periods had passed since his interview with Fraffin, yet Kelexel felt the past which had terminated in the director\u0027s salon had receded into dimness. The \"amusing little story\" centered on Ruth\u0027s parent had been recorded and terminated. (Kelexel found it less amusing every time he viewed it.) All that remained was to find a suitable outpost planet for his own uses.\\n\\n Back and forth Ruth paced. She\u0027d be at the pantovive in a moment, he knew. She hadn\u0027t used it yet in his presence, but he could see her glancing at it. He could sense the machine drawing her into its orbit.\\n\\n Kelexel glanced up at the manipulator controlling her emotions. The strength of its setting frightened him. She\u0027d be immune to it one day; no doubt of that. The manipulator was a great metal insect spread over the ceiling.\\n\\n Kelexel sighed.\\n\\n Now that he knew Ruth was a wild Chem, her ancestry heavily infused with storyship bloodlines, he found his feelings about her disturbed. She had become more than a creature, almost a person.\\n\\n Was it right to manipulate a person? Wrong? Right? Conscience? The attitudes of this world\u0027s exotics infused strange doubts into him. Ruth wasn\u0027t full Chem --never could be. She hadn\u0027t been taken in infancy, transformed and stunted by immortality. She was marked down at no position in Tiggywaugh\u0027s web.\\n\\n What would the Primacy do when they found out? Was Fraffin correct? Would they blot this world? They were capable of it. But the natives were so attractive it didn\u0027t seem possible they\u0027d be obliterated. They were Chem --wild Chem. But no matter the Primacy\u0027s attentions, this place would be overwhelmed. No one presently partaking of its pleasures would have a part in the new order.\\n\\n Arguments went back and forth in his mind in a pattern much like Ruth\u0027s pacing.\\n\\n Her movement began to anger him. She did this to annoy him, deliberately testing the limits of her power. Kelexel reached beneath his cloak, adjusted the manipulator.\\n\\n Ruth stopped as though drawn up against a wall. She turned, faced him. \"Again?\" she asked, her voice flat.\\n\\n \"Take off your robe,\" he said.\\n\\n She stood unmoving. Kelexel exerted more pressure, repeated his command. The manipulator\u0027s setting went up ... up ... up ...\\n\\n Slowly, woodenly she obeyed. The robe dropped to the silvery piled carpet, leaving her nude. Her flesh appeared suddenly pale. Rippling tremors moved up and down her stomach.\\n\\n \"Turn around,\" he said.\\n\\n With the same wooden movement, she obeyed. One of her bare feet caught the emerald belt. Its chain rattled.\\n\\n \"Face me.\" Kelexel said.\\n\\n When she\u0027d obeyed, Kelexel released the manipulator\u0027s pressure. The tremors stopped moving across her stomach. She took a deep, ragged breath.\\n\\n How superbly graceful she is, Kelexel thought.\\n\\n Without taking her gaze from him, Ruth bent, picked up the robe, slipped into it, belted it\\n\\n There! she thought. I\u0027ve resisted him. I\u0027ve asserted myself at last. It\u0027ll be easier next time. And she remembered the sodden pressure of the manipulator, the compulsion which had forced her to disrobe. Even in that extremity, she\u0027d felt the sureness that a time would come when she could resist Kelexel\u0027s manipulator no matter its pressure. There\u0027d be a limit to the pressure, she knew, but no limit to her growing will to resist. She had only to think of what she\u0027d seen on the pantovive to strengthen that core of resistance.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re angry with me,\" Kelexel said. \"Why? I\u0027ve indulged your every fancy.\"\\n\\n For answer, she seated herself at the pantovive\u0027s metal webwork, moved its controls. Keys clicked. Instruments hummed.\\n\\n How deftly she uses her toy, Kelexel thought. She\u0027s been at it more than I suspected. Such practiced sureness! But when has she had time to become this sure? She\u0027s never used it in front of me before. I\u0027ve seen her each rest period. Perhaps time moves at a different rate for mortals. How long to her has she been with me? A quarter of her sun\u0027s circuit or maybe a bit more.\\n\\n He wondered then how she really felt about the offspring within her body. Primitives felt many things about their bodies, knew many things without recourse to instruments. Some wild sense they had which spoke to them from within. Could the potential offspring be why she was angered?\\n\\n \"Look,\" Ruth said.\\n\\n Kelexel sat upright, focused on the pantovive\u0027s image stage, the glowing oval where Fraffin\u0027s almost-people performed. Figures moved there, the gross wild Chem. Kelexel was suddenly reminded of a comment he\u0027d heard about Fraffin\u0027s productions --\"Their reverse dollhouse quality.\" Yes, his creatures always managed to seem emotionally as well as physically larger than life.\\n\\n \"These are relatives of mine,\" Ruth said. \"My father\u0027s brother and sister. They came out for the trial. This is their motel room.\"\\n\\n \"Motel?\" Kelexel slipped off the bed, crossed to stand beside Ruth.\\n\\n \"Temporary housing,\" she said. She sat down at the controls.\\n\\n Kelexel studied the stage. Its bubble of light contained a room of faded maroon. A thin, straw-haired female sat on the edge of a bed at the right. She wore a pink dressing gown. One heavily veined hand dabbed a damp handkerchief at her eyes. Like the furniture, she appeared faded-dull eyes, sagging cheeks. In the general shape of her head and body, she resembled Ruth\u0027s father. Kelexel wondered then if Ruth would come to this one day. Surely not. The strange female\u0027s eyes peered from deep sockets beneath thin brows.\\n\\n A man stood facing her, his back to the viewers.\\n\\n \"Now, Claudie,\" the man said, \"there\u0027s no sense ... \"\\n\\n \"I just can\u0027t help remembering,\" she said. A sob in her voice.\\n\\n Kelexel swallowed. His body drank emotional identification with the creatures in the pantovive. It was uncanny --repellant and at once magnetic. The pantovive\u0027s sensimesh web projected a cloying sweet emotion from the woman. It was stifling.\\n\\n \"I remember one time on the farm near Marion,\" she said. \"Joey was about three that night we was sitting on the porch after the preacher\u0027d been there to dinner. Paw was wondering out loud how he could get that twelve acres down by the creek.\"\\n\\n \"He was always wondering that.\"\\n\\n \"And Joey said he had to go toi-toi.\"\\n\\n \"That danged outhouse,\" Grant said.\\n\\n \"Remember them narrow boards across the mud? Joey was still wearing that white suit Ma\u0027d made for him.\"\\n\\n \"Claudie, what\u0027s the use remembering all ... \"\\n\\n \"You remember that night?\"\\n\\n \"Claudie, that was a long time ago.\"\\n\\n \"I remember it. Joey asked all around for someone to go out with him across them boards, but Paw said for him to git along. What\u0027s he scared of?\"\\n\\n \"Doggone, Claudie, you sound like Paw sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"I remember Joey going out there all by hisself --a little white blot like in the dark. Then Paw yipped: \u0027Joey! Look out for that buck nigger ahint you!\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"And Joey ran!\" Grant said. \"I remember.\"\\n\\n \"And he slipped off into the mud.\"\\n\\n \"He come back all dirty,\" Grant said, \"I remember.\" He chuckled.\\n\\n \"And when Paw found out he\u0027d wet hisself, too, he went and got the razor strop.\" Her voice softened. \"Joey was such a little feller.\"\\n\\n \"Paw was a strict one, all right.\"\\n\\n \"Funny the things you remember sometimes,\" she said.\\n\\n Grant moved across to a window, picked at the maroon drapery. Turning, he revealed his face-the same fine bone structure as Ruth, but with heavy flesh over it A sharp line crossed his forehead where a hat had been worn, the face dark beneath it, light above. His eyes appeared hidden in shadowed holes. The hand at the drapery was darkly veined.\\n\\n \"This is real dry country,\" he said. \"Nothing ever looks green out here.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder why he done it?\" Claudie asked.\\n\\n Grant shrugged. \"He was a strange one, that Joey.\"\\n\\n \"Listen to you,\" she said. \"Was a strange one. Already talking like he was dead.\"\\n\\n \"I guess he is, Claudie. Just as good as.\" He shook his head. \"Either dead or committed to an insane asylum. Same thing really when they stick you away like that\"\\n\\n \"I heard you talk plenty about what happened when we was kids,\" she said. \"You figure that had anything to do with him going ... like this?\"\\n\\n \"What had anything to do with it?\"\\n\\n \"The way Paw treated him.\"\\n\\n Grant found a loose thread in the drapery. He pulled it out, rolled it between his fingers. The sensimesh web projected a feeling of long-repressed anger from him.\\n\\n (Kelexel wondered then why Ruth showed him this scene. He understood in a way the pain she must feel at seeing this, but how could she blame him or be angry at him for this? What had happened to her parents ... that\u0027d been Fraffin\u0027s doing.)\\n\\n \"That time we went to the county fair to hear the darky singers,\" Grant said. \"In the mule wagon, remember? Joey didn\u0027t want to come along. He was mad at Paw for something, but Paw said he was too young to leave at home alone.\"\\n\\n \"He must\u0027ve been all of nine then,\" she said.\\n\\n Grant went on as though he hadn\u0027t heard. \"Then when Joey refused to leave the wagon, remember? Paw says: \u0027Come along, boy. Don\u0027t you want to hear them niggers?\u0027 And Joey says: \u0027I guess I\u0027ll stay with the mules and wagon.\u0027\"\\n\\n Claudie nodded.\\n\\n Another thread came out of the drapery into Grant\u0027s hand. He said: \"I heard you plenty of times when you didn\u0027t want to go someplace say: \u0027Guess I\u0027ll stay with the mules and wagon.\u0027 We had half the county saying it.\"\\n\\n \"Joey was like that,\" she said. \"Always wanting to be alone.\"\\n\\n Grant\u0027s lips formed a harsh smile. \"Everything seemed to happen to Joey.\"\\n\\n \"Was you there when he ran away?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. That was after you was married, wasn\u0027t it? Paw sold Joey\u0027s horse that he\u0027d worked all summer cutting wood to buy from old Poor-John Weeks, Ned Tolliver\u0027s brother-in-law.\"\\n\\n \"Did you see the ruckus?\"\\n\\n \"I was right there. Joey called Paw a liar and a cheat and a thief. Paw went to reach for the white oak club, but Joey was quicker. He must\u0027ve been seventeen then, and strong. He brung that club down on Paw\u0027s head like he wanted to kill him. Paw went down like a pole- axed steer. Joey ripped the money Paw\u0027d got for the horse outen his pocket, ran upstairs, packed the gladstone and left.\"\\n\\n \"That was a terrible thing,\" she said.\\n\\n Grant nodded. \"Long as I live I\u0027ll remember, that boy standing there on the porch, that bag in his hand and holding that screen door. Maw was sobbing over Paw, dabbing at his head with a wet towel. Joey spoke so low we\u0027d never\u0027ve heard if we hadn\u0027t all been so scared and quiet. We thought Paw was dead for sure.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027I hope I never see any of you ever again,\u0027 Joey says. And he run off.\"\\n\\n \"He had Paw\u0027s temper and that\u0027s for sure,\" Claudie said.\\n\\n Ruth slapped the pantovive cutoff. The images faded. She turned, her face composed and blank from the pressures of the manipulator, but there were tear stains down her cheeks.\\n\\n \"I must know something,\" she said. \"Did you Chem do that to my father? Did you ... make him that way?\"\\n\\n Kelexel recalled Fraffin boasting how the killer had been prepared ... boasting and explaining how an Investigator from the Primacy stood no chance to escape the traps of this world. But why waste concern over a few suborders demeaned and shaped to Chem needs? Precisely because they were not suborders. They were wild Chem.\\n\\n \"You did, I see,\" Ruth said. \"I suspected it from what you\u0027ve told me.\"\\n\\n Am I so transparent to her? Kelexel asked himself. How did she know that? What strange powers do these natives have?\\n\\n He covered his confusion with a shrug.\\n\\n \"I wish you could die,\" Ruth said. \"I want you to die.\"\\n\\n Despite the manipulator\u0027s pressure on her, Ruth could feel rage deep inside her, remote but distinct, a burning and smoldering anger that made her want to reach out and waste her fingernails clawing at this Chem\u0027s impervious skin.\\n\\n Ruth\u0027s voice had come out so level and flat that Kelexel found he\u0027d heard the words and almost passed over them before he absorbed their meaning. Die! She wished him dead! He recoiled. What a boorish, outrageous thing for her to say!\\n\\n \"I am a Chem,\" he said. \"How dare you say such a thing to a Chem?\"\\n\\n \"You really don\u0027t know, do you?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve smiled upon you, brought you into my society,\" he said. \"Is this your gratitude?\" Kelexel slipped off the bed, crossed the room.\\n\\n She glanced around her prison room, focused on his face --the silvery skin dull and metallic, the features drawn into a sharp frown of disdain. Kelexel\u0027s position standing beside her chair put him only slightly above her and she could see the dark hairs quivering in his nostrils as he breathed.\\n\\n \"I almost pity you,\" she said.\\n\\n Kelexel swallowed. Pity? Her reaction was unnerving. He looked down at his hands, was surprised to find them clasped tightly together. Pity? Slowly, he separated his fingers, noting how the nails were getting that foggy warning look, the reaction from breeding. Reproducing itself, his body had set the clock of flesh ticking. Rejuvenation was needed, and that soon. Was this why she pitied him, because he\u0027d delayed his rejuvenation? No; she couldn\u0027t know of the Chem subservience to the Rejuvenators.\\n\\n Delay ... delay ... why am I delaying? Kelexel wondered.\\n\\n Suddenly, he marveled at himself --his own bravery and daring. He\u0027d let himself go far beyond the point where other Chem went racing for the Rejuvenators. He\u0027d done this thing almost deliberately, he knew, toying with sensations of mortality. What other Chem would\u0027ve dared. They were cowards all! He was almost like Ruth in this. Almost mortal! And here she railed at him! She didn\u0027t understand. How could she, poor creature?\\n\\n A wave of self-pity washed through him. How could anyone understand this? Who even knew? His fellow Chem would all assume he\u0027d availed himself of a Rejuvenator when he\u0027d needed it. No one understood.\\n\\n Kelexel hesitated on the verge of telling Ruth this daring thing he\u0027d done, but he remembered her words. She wished him dead.\\n\\n \"How can I show you?\" Ruth asked. Again, she turned to the pantovive, adjusted its controls. This disgusting machine, product of the disgusting Chem, was suddenly very important to her. It was the most vital thing in her life at this moment to show Kelexel why she nurtured such a seed of violent hate toward him. \"Look,\" she said.\\n\\n Within the pantovive\u0027s bubble of light there appeared a long room with a high desk at one end, rows of benches below it set off behind a rail, tables, another railed-off section on the right with twelve natives seated in it in various poses of boredom. The side walls held spaced Grecian columns separated by dark wood paneling and tall windows. Morning sunlight poured in the windows. Behind the high desk sat a round ball of a man in black robes, bald pod of head bent forward into the light.\\n\\n Kelexel found he recognized some of the natives seated at the tables below the high desk. There was the squat figure of Joe Murphey, Ruth\u0027s parent, and there was Bondelli, the legal expert he\u0027d seen in Fraffin\u0027s story rushes-narrow face, black hair combed back in beetle wings. In chairs immediately behind the railing there were the witch doctors, Whelye and Thurlow.\\n\\n Thurlow interested Kelexel. Why had she chosen a scene containing that native male? Was it true that she\u0027d have mated with this creature?\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Judge Grimm,\" Ruth said, indicating the man in the black robes. \"I ... I went to school with his daughter. Do you know that? I\u0027ve ... been in his home.\"\\n\\n Kelexel heard the sounds of distress in her voice, considered a higher setting on the manipulator, decided against it. That might introduce too much inhibition for her to continue. He found himself intensely curious now as to what Ruth was doing. What could her motives be?\\n\\n \"The man with the cane there at the left, at that table, that\u0027s Paret, the District Attorney,\" Ruth said. \"His wife and my mother were in the same garden club.\"\\n\\n Kelexel looked at the native she\u0027d indicated. There was a look of solidness and integrity about him. Iron gray hair topped a squarish head. The hair made a straight line across his forehead and was trimmed closely above prominent ears. The chin had a forward thrust. The mouth was a prim, neat modulation on the way to a solid nose. The brows were bushy brown ovals above blue eyes. At their outer edges, the eyes made a slight downward slant accented by deep creases.\\n\\n The cane leaned against the table beside his chair. Now and again, Paret touched its knobbed top.\\n\\n Something important appeared to be happening in this room now. Ruth turned up the sound and there came a noise of coughing from the ranked spectators, a hissing sound as papers were shuffled.\\n\\n Kelexel leaned forward, a hand on the back of Ruth\u0027s chair, staring as Thurlow arose and went to a chair beside the high desk. There was a brief religious rite involving truthfulness and Thurlow was seated, the legal expert, Bondelli, standing below him.\\n\\n Kelexel studied Thurlow --the wide forehead, the dark hair. Without the manipulator, would Ruth prefer this creature? Thurlow gave the impression of crouching behind his dark glasses. There was an aura of shifting uneasiness about him. He was refusing to look in a particular place. It came over Kelexel that Thurlow was avoiding Fraffin\u0027s shooting crew in this scene. He was aware of the Chem! Of course! He was immune.\\n\\n A sense of duty returned momentarily to Kelexel then. He felt shame, guilt. And he knew quite suddenly why he hadn\u0027t gone to one of the storyship\u0027s Rejuvenators. Once he did that, he\u0027d be committed finally to Fraffin\u0027s trap. He\u0027d be one of them, owned by Fraffin as certainly as any native of this world. As long as he put it off, Kelexel knew he was just that much free of Fraffin. It was only a matter of time, though. Bondelli was speaking to Thurlow now and it seemed a tired, useless little scene. Kelexel wondered at his reaction.\\n\\n \"Now, Dr. Thurlow,\" Bondelli said, \"you\u0027ve enumerated the points this defendant has in common with other insane killers. What else leads you to the conclusion that he is in fact insane?\"\\n\\n \"I was attracted to the recurrence of the number seven,\" Thurlow said. \"Seven blows with the sword. He told the arresting officers he\u0027d be out in seven minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Is this important?\"\\n\\n \"Seven has religious significance: the Lord made the world in seven days, and so on. It\u0027s the kind of tiling you find dominant in the actions of the insane.\"\\n\\n \"Did you, Dr. Thurlow, examine this defendant some months ago?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Under what circumstances?\"\\n\\n Kelexel glanced at Ruth, noted with a sense of shock the tears streaming down her cheeks. He looked at the manipulator\u0027s setting and began to understand how profound her emotions must be.\\n\\n \"Mr. Murphey had turned in a false fire alarm,\" Thurlow said. \"He was identified and arrested. I was called in as court psychologist.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"False fire alarms are not a thing to be disregarded, especially when turned in by a man well along in his adult years.\"\\n\\n \"This is why you were called in?\"\\n\\n \"No --that was routine, more or less.\"\\n\\n \"But what\u0027s the significance of the false fire alarm?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s sexual, basically. This incident occurred at about the time this defendant first complained of sexual impotency. These two things, taken together, paint a very disturbing psychological picture.\"\\n\\n \"How is that?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he also displayed an almost complete lack of warmth in his nature. It was a failing in those things we usually refer to as kindly. He produced Rorschach responses at that time which were almost completely lacking in those elements we refer to as alive. In other words, his outlook was centered on death. I took all of those things into consideration: a cold nature centered on death plus sexual disturbance.\"\\n\\n Kelexel stared at the figure on the pantovive\u0027s stage. Who was he talking about? Cold, centered on death, sexually disturbed. Kelexel glanced at the figure of Murphey. The defendant sat huddled over his table, eyes downcast\\n\\n Bondelli ran a finger along his mustache, glanced at a note in his hand.\\n\\n \"What was the substance of your report to the Probation Department, doctor?\" Bondelli asked. As he spoke, he looked at Judge Grimm.\\n\\n \"I warned them that unless he changed his ways radically, this man was headed for a psychotic break.\"\\n\\n Still without looking at Thurlow, Bondelli asked: \"And would you define psychotic break, doctor?\"\\n\\n \"By example --a sword slaying of a loved one using violence and wild passion is a psychotic break.\"\\n\\n Judge Grimm scribbled on a piece of paper in front of him. A woman juror on the far right frowned at Bondelli.\\n\\n \"You predicted this crime?\" Bondelli asked.\\n\\n \"In a real sense --yes.\"\\n\\n The District Attorney was watching the jury. He shook his head slowly, leaned over to whisper to an aide.\\n\\n \"Was any action taken on your report?\" Bondelli asked.\\n\\n \"To my knowledge, none.\"\\n\\n \"Well, why not?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps many of those who saw the report weren\u0027t aware of the dangers involved in the terms.\"\\n\\n \"Did you attempt to impress the sense of danger upon anyone?\"\\n\\n \"I explained my worries to several members of the Probation Department\"\\n\\n \"And still no action was taken?\"\\n\\n \"They said that surely Mr. Murphey, an important member of the community, couldn\u0027t be dangerous, that possibly I was mistaken.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Did you make any personal effort to help this defendant?\"\\n\\n \"I attempted to interest him in religion.\"\\n\\n \"Without success?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Have you examined defendant recently?\"\\n\\n \"Last Wednesday-which was my second examination of him since he was arrested.\"\\n\\n \"And what did you find?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s suffering from a condition I\u0027d define as a paranoid state.\"\\n\\n \"Could he have known the nature and consequences of his act?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. His mental condition would\u0027ve been such as to override any considerations of law or morality.\"\\n\\n Bondelli turned away, stared for a long moment at the District Attorney, then: \"That is all, doctor.\"\\n\\n The District Attorney passed a finger across the squared-off hairline of his forehead, studied his notes on the testimony.\\n\\n Kelexel, absorbed in the intricacies of the scene, nodded to himself. The natives obviously had a rudimentary legal system and sense of justice, but it was all very crude. Still, it reminded him of his own guilt. Could that be why Ruth showed him this? he wondered. Was she saying: \"You, too, could be punished\"? A paroxysm of shame convulsed him then. He felt that somehow Ruth had put him on trial here, placed him by proxy in that room of judgment which the pantovive reproduced. He suddenly identified with her father, sharing the native\u0027s emotion through the pantovive\u0027s sensimesh web.\\n\\n And Murphey was seated in silent rage, the emotion directed with violent intensity against Thurlow who still sat in the witness chair.\\n\\n That immune must be destroyed! Kelexel thought\\n\\n The pantovive\u0027s image focus shifted slightly, centered on the District Attorney. Paret arose, limped to a position below Thurlow, leaned on the cane. Paret\u0027s narrow mouth was held in a thin look of primness, but anger smoldered from the eyes.\\n\\n \"Mr. Thurlow,\" he said, pointedly withholding the title of doctor. \"Am I correct in assuming that, in your opinion, defendant was incapable of determining right from wrong on the night he killed his wife?\"\\n\\n Thurlow removed his glasses. His eyes appeared gray and defenseless without them. He wiped the lenses, replaced them, dropped his hands to his lap. \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"And the kinds of tests you administered, were they generally the same kinds as were administered to this defendant by Dr. Whelye and those who agreed with him?\"\\n\\n \"Essentially the same --inkblot, wool sorting, various other shifting tests.\"\\n\\n Paret consulted his notes. \"You\u0027ve heard Dr. Whelye testify that defendant was legally and medically sane at the time of this crime?\"\\n\\n \"I heard that testimony, sir.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re aware that Dr. Whelye is former police psychiatrist for the city of Los Angeles and served in the Army medical corps at the Nuremberg trials?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware of Dr. Whelye\u0027s qualifications.\" There was a lonely, defensive quality to Thurlow\u0027s voice that brought a twinge of sympathy to Kelexel as he watched.\\n\\n \"You see what they\u0027re doing to him?\" Ruth asked.\\n\\n \"What does it matter?\" Kelexel asked. But even as he spoke, Kelexel realized that Thurlow\u0027s fate mattered enormously. And this was precisely because Thurlow, even though he was being destroyed and knew it, was sticking to his principles. There was no doubt that Murphey was insane. He\u0027d been driven insane by Fraffin-for a purpose.\\n\\n I was that purpose, Kelexel thought\\n\\n \"Then you have heard,\" Paret said, \"this expert medical testimony rule out any element of organic brain damage in this case? You\u0027ve heard these qualified medical men testify that defendant shows no manic tendencies, that he does not now suffer and never has suffered from a condition which could be legally described as insanity?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Then you can explain why you\u0027ve arrived at a conflicting opinion to these qualified medical men?\"\\n\\n Thurlow uncrossed his legs, planted both feet firmly on the floor. He put his hands on the arms of his chair, leaned forward. \"That\u0027s quite simple, sir. Ability in psychiatry and psychology is usually judged by results. In this case, I stake my claim to a different viewpoint on the fact that I predicted this crime.\"\\n\\n Anger darkened Paret\u0027s face.\\n\\n Kelexel heard Ruth whispering: \"Andy, oh, Andy ... oh, Andy ... \" Her voice sent a sudden pain through Kelexel\u0027s breast and he hissed: \"Be silent!\"\\n\\n Again, Paret consulted his notes, then: \"You\u0027re a psychologist, not a psychiatrist, is that correct?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a clinical psychologist.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?\"\\n\\n \"A psychologist is a specialist in human behavior who does not have a medical degree. The ... \"\\n\\n \"And you disagree with men who do have medical degrees?\"\\n\\n \"As I said previously ... \"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, your so-called prediction. I\u0027ve read that report, Mr. Thurlow, and I\u0027d like to ask you this: Is it not true that your probation report was couched in language which might be translated several ways --that it was, in a word, ambiguous?\"\\n\\n \"It might be considered ambiguous only by someone who was unfamiliar with the term psychotic break,\"\\n\\n \"Ahhh, and what is a psychotic break?\"\\n\\n \"An extremely dangerous break with reality which can lead to acts of violence such as that being considered here.\"\\n\\n \"But if there\u0027d been no crime, if this defendant had recovered from the alleged illness which you say he has, could your probation report have been construed as predicting that?\"\\n\\n \"Not without an explanation of why he recovered.\"\\n\\n \"Let me ask this, then: Can violence have no other explanation except psychosis?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly it can, but ... \"\\n\\n \"Is it not true that psychosis is a disputed term?\"\\n\\n \"There are differences of opinion.\"\\n\\n \"Differences such as are being evidenced here?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And any given act of violence may be caused by things other than a psychosis?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Thurlow shook his head. \"But in a delusionary system ... \"\\n\\n \"Delusionary?\" Paret snapped at the word. \"What is delusion, Mr. Thurlow?\"\\n\\n \"Delusion? That\u0027s a kind of inner ineptness at dealing with reality.\"\\n\\n \"Reality,\" Paret said. And again: \"Reality. Tell me, Mr. Thurlow, do you believe the defendant\u0027s accusations against his wife?\"\\n\\n \"I do not!\"\\n\\n \"But if defendant\u0027s accusations were real, would that change your opinion, sir, about his delusionary system?\"\\n\\n \"My opinion is based on ... \"\\n\\n \"Yes or no, Mr. Thurlow! Answer the question!\"\\n\\n \"I am answering it!\" Thurlow pushed himself back in his chair, took a deep breath. \"You\u0027re trying to blacken the reputation of a defenseless ... \"\\n\\n \"Mr. Thurlow! My questions are aimed at whether defendant\u0027s accusations are reasonable in the light of all the evidence. I agree they cannot be proved or disproved with the principal dead, but are the accusations reasonable?\"\\n\\n Thurlow swallowed, then: \"Was it reasonable to kill, sir?\"\\n\\n Paret\u0027s face darkened. His voice came out low, deadly: \"It\u0027s time we quit playing with words, Mr. Thurlow. Will you tell the court, please, if you have any other relationship with the defendant\u0027s family than that of ... psychologist?\"\\n\\n Thurlow\u0027s knuckles went white as he gripped the chair arm. \"What do you mean?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Were you not at one time engaged to defendant\u0027s daughter?\"\\n\\n Thurlow nodded mutely.\\n\\n \"Speak up,\" Paret said. \"Were you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n At the defense table, Bondelli stood up, glared at Paret, looked up at the judge. \"Your honor, I object. This line of questioning is not relevant.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Paret swiveled. He leaned heavily on his cane, said: \"Your honor, the jury has the right to know all the factors which have guided this expert witness in arriving at his opinion.\"\\n\\n \"What is your intention?\" Judge Grimm asked. He looked over Paret\u0027s head at the jury.\\n\\n \"Defendant\u0027s daughter is not available for testimony, your honor. She is missing under mysterious circumstances attendant upon the death of her husband. This expert witness was in the immediate vicinity when the husband ... \"\\n\\n \"Your honor, I object!\" Bondelli pounded a fist on the table.\\n\\n Judge Grimm pursed his lips. He glanced down at Thurlow\u0027s profile, then at Paret. \"What I say now I do not say as approval or as disapproval of Dr. Thurlow\u0027s present testimony. But I will state by way of accepting his qualifications that he is psychologist for this court. As such, he may present opinions in disagreement with the opinions of other qualified witnesses. This is the privilege of expert testimony. It is up to the jury to decide which experts it will accept as being the most reliable. The jury may arrive at such decision strictly on the expert qualifications of the witnesses. Objection sustained.\"\\n\\n Paret shrugged. He limped a step closer to Thurlow, appeared about to speak, hesitated, then: \"Very well. No more questions.\"\\n\\n \"Witness may stand down,\" the judge said.\\n\\n As the scene began to fade under Ruth\u0027s manipulation of the pantovive, Kelexel focused on Joe Murphey. The defendant was smiling, a sly, secretive smile.\\n\\n Kelexel nodded, matched that smile. Nothing was entirely lost when even the victims could share amusement at their predicament.\\n\\n Ruth turned, saw the smile on Kelexel\u0027s face. In her flat, controlled voice, she said: \"God damn you for every second of your goddamn\u0027 eternity.\"\\n\\n Kelexel blinked.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re as crazy as my father,\" she said. \"Andy\u0027s describing you when he talks about my father.\" She whirled back to the pantovive. \"See yourself!\"\\n\\n Kelexel took a deep, shivering breath. The pantovive screeched as Ruth twisted its controls and rapped keys.\\n\\n He wanted to jerk her away from the machine, fearful of what she might show him. See myself? he wondered. It was a terrifying thought. A Chem did not see himself in the pantovive!\\n\\n The bubble of light on the image stage became Bondelli\u0027s law office, the big desk, glass- fronted bookcases shielding the mud-red backs of law books with their gold lettering. Bondelli sat behind the desk, a pencil in his right hand. He pushed the pencil point down through his fingers, repeated the action with the eraser against the desk. The eraser left little rubber smudges on the polished surface.\\n\\n Thurlow sat across from him behind a scattering of papers. He clutched his heavy glasses like a lecturer\u0027s pointer in his left hand, waving them as he spoke.\\n\\n \"The delusional system is like a mask,\" Thurlow said. Vertical cords smoothed and reappeared in his neck as he gestured. \"Behind that mask, Murphey wants to be found sane even though he knows that this condemns him to death.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not logical,\" Bondelli muttered.\\n\\n \"And if it isn\u0027t logical it\u0027s the most difficult thing there is to prove,\" Thurlow said. \"This is hard to put into words that can be understood by people who haven\u0027t had long familiarity with such things. But if Murphey\u0027s delusional system were shattered, if we penetrated it, broke it down, this could be compared to what it would be like for an ordinary person to awaken one morning and find his bed different from the one he thought he went to sleep in, the room different, a different woman saying, \u0027I\u0027m your wife!\u0027, unfamiliar youngsters claiming him as father. He\u0027d be overwhelmed, his whole concept of his life destroyed.\"\\n\\n \"Total unreality,\" Bondelli whispered.\\n\\n \"Reality from the standpoint of an objective observer isn\u0027t important here,\" Thurlow said. \"As long as Murphey maintains the delusional system he saves himself from the psychological equivalent of annihilation. That, of course, is the fear of death.\"\\n\\n \"Fear of death?\" Bondelli appeared puzzled. \"But that\u0027s what faces him if ... \"\\n\\n \"There\u0027re two kinds of death here. Murphey has far less fear for real death in the gas chamber than he has for the kind of death he\u0027d experience in the collapse of his delusional world.\"\\n\\n \"But can\u0027t he see the difference?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s crazy!\"\\n\\n Thurlow appeared surprised. \"Isn\u0027t that what we\u0027ve been saying?\"\\n\\n Bondelli dropped the pencil onto the desk with a sharp click. \"And what happens if he\u0027s judged sane?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d be convinced he controlled this one last piece of his misfortune. To him, insanity means loss of control. It means he\u0027s not the all great, all powerful person in control of his own destiny. If he controls even his own death, this is grandeur --a delusion of grandeur.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t something you can prove in a court of law,\" Bondelli said.\\n\\n \"Especially not in this community and not right now,\" Thurlow said. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to tell you from the beginning. You know Vauntman, my neighbor to the south? My walnut tree had a limb overhanging his yard. I\u0027ve always let him have the nuts off it. We made a joke about it. Last night he sawed that limb off and threw it in my yard-because I\u0027m testifying for Murphey\u0027s defense.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s insane!\" \"Right now insanity is the norm,\" Thurlow said. He shook his head. \"Vauntman\u0027s perfectly normal under most circumstances. But this Murphey thing\u0027s a sex crime and it\u0027s stirred up a rat\u0027s nest of unconscious content --guilt, fear, shame --that people aren\u0027t equipped to handle. Vauntman\u0027s just one isolated symptom. The whole community\u0027s undergoing a kind of psychotic break.\"\\n\\n Thurlow put on his dark glasses, turned, stared directly out of the pantovive.\\n\\n \"The whole community,\" he whispered.\\n\\n Ruth reached out like a blind person, shut off the pantovive. As the stage darkened, Thurlow still stared out at her, Goodbye, Andy, she thought. Dear Andy. Destroyed Andy. I\u0027ll never see you again.\\n\\n Abruptly, Kelexel whirled away, strode across the room. He turned there, stared at Ruth\u0027s back, cursing the day he\u0027d first seen her. In the name of Silence! he thought. Why did I succumb to her?\\n\\n Thurlow\u0027s words still rang in his ears --Grandeur! Delusion! Death!\\n\\n What was it about these natives that locked on the mind and senses, refusing to let go? A rage such as he\u0027d never before experienced flooded through Kelexel then.\\n\\n How dare she say I am like her father?\\n\\n How dare she harbor one thought for her puny native lover when she has me?\\n\\n An odd rasping sound was coming from Ruth. Her shoulders trembled and shook. Kelexel realized she was sobbing despite the manipulator\u0027s suppression. The realization fed his rage.\\n\\n Slowly, she turned in the pantovive\u0027s chair, stared at him. Strange lines of grief wavered across her face. \"Live forever!\" she hissed. \"And every day you live, I hope your crime gnaws at you!\" The hate was stark in her eyes.\\n\\n A sense of dismay shook Kelexel. How can she know of my crime? he asked himself.\\n\\n But rage was there to support him.\\n\\n She was contaminated by that immune! he thought Let her see what a Chem can do to her lover, then!\\n\\n With a vicious movement, Kelexel twisted the manipulator\u0027s controls beneath his tunic. The pressure, building up abruptly, jerked Ruth backward into her chair, stiffened her body then relaxed it. She slumped into unconsciousness. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-16.html","bookId":1572,"book":{"id":1572,"title":"The Heaven Makers","description":"Storyline: The Heaven Makers is set on contemporary Earth with the one difference that we are being watched and manipulated by aliens for their viewing pleasure.
