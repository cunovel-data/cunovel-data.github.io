{"id":110068,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"2\n THE GREETER\u0027S REPORT CAME TO FRAFFIN WHERE HE sat at his pantovive editing the latest rushes on his current story.\n The war, the war, the lovely little war, he was thinking.\n And oh, how Chem audiences loved the effect of flamelighted nights, the naked panting of these creatures in their mortal struggles. One of their leaders reminded him of Cato -- the same eternally ancient features, the cynical glaze of inward-drinking eyes. Cato, now ... there\u0027d been a grand story.\n But the pantovive\u0027s three-dimensional images faded, the tracing light receded before the priority of a message, and there was Ynvic\u0027s face staring at him, her bald head glistening under the lights in her surgery, her heavy brows arched in a quizzical frown.\n \"A visitor calling himself Kelexel has arrived,\" she said. (And Fraffin, watching the flash of her teeth, the heavy lips, thought: She\u0027s overdue for rejuvenation.) \"This Kelexel most likely is the Investigator we\u0027ve been expecting,\" she added.\n Fraffin straightened, uttered a curse that\u0027d been popular on his world in the time of Hasdrubal: \"Bal, burn their seed!\" Then: \"How certain are you?\"\n \"The visitor is a visitor to perfection,\" Ynvic said. She shrugged. \"He is too perfect. Only the Bureau could be that perfect.\"\n Fraffin settled back into his editing chair. She was probably correct. The Investigator\u0027s timing was about right. Out in the Chem universe they didn\u0027t have this feeling for the nicety of timing. Time ran at such a crazy speed for most Chem. But association with the creatures of this world imparted a pseudosense of time. Yes, it was probably the Investigator.\n He looked up and around at his silver-walled salon-office in the heart of the storyship. This long low place crammed with creative machinery and the devices of relaxation usually remained insulated from transient planetary distractions. As a rule, only Ynvic dared disturb him at his work here. She would not do it lightly. Something about this visitor, Kelexel, had alerted her.\n Fraffin sighed.\n Even through the storyship\u0027s sophisticated barriers and the deeps of ocean in which they hid, he often felt that he could sense the passage of the planet\u0027s sun and moon and that troubles waited for the worst conjunctions to plague him.\n Waiting behind him on his desk was a report from Lutt, his Master-of-Craft, that new three-man shooting crew, youngsters of promise all, had been out on the surface with shields down letting the natives see them, stirring up a storm of local speculation. Teasing the natives was, of course, an ancient diversion with the Chem of this storyship.\n But not now.\n Why did they choose this particular moment? he wondered.\n \"Well throw this Kelexel a sop,\" he said. \"The shooting crew that was out teasing the natives. Dismissal for all of them and for the dispatcher who allowed them to surface without an old hand as guide.\"\n \"They may talk,\" Ynvic said. \"They don\u0027t dare,\" he said. \"Anyway, explain what\u0027s happened and send them along with recommendations to one of the new ships. I hate to lose them, but ... \" He shrugged.\n \"Is that all you\u0027re going to do?\" Ynvic asked.\n Fraffin passed a hand over his eyes, scratched his left brow. Her meaning was clear, but he hated to abandon the lovely little war. He stared into the glittering shell of the pantovive where his memory still held the lingering images of violence. If he pulled out his Manipulators, the natives likely would settle their differences across a conference table. They had that tendency more and more of late.\n Again, he thought of the problems awaiting him at his desk. There was the memo from Albik, the story-chief, the usual complaint: \"If you wish me to cover this much story action simultaneously then I must have more skimmers and platforms, more shooting crews, more cutting-room operators ... more ... more ... more ... \"\n Fraffin longed for the good old days when Birstala had been his story-chief. There was a man capable of making his own decisions when the equipment and crews wouldn\u0027t stretch. But Birstala had succumbed to the immortal nemesis, boredom. He had his own story-ship now with the seed from this planet and his own world somewhere off beyond the beyond. He had his own problems.\n \"Maybe you should sell out,\" Ynvic said.\n He glared at her. \"That\u0027s impossible and you know why!\"\n \"The right buyer ... \"\n \"Ynvic!\"\n She shrugged.\n Fraffin pushed himself out of the editing chair, crossed to his desk. Its immersed viewscreen showed the discus galaxies and variable stars of the Chem birthworlds. A touch of the controls and this scene vanished to present a view from space looking down on their private little planet, this blue-green world with its patterns of clouds over seas and continents, the sharp flakes of star cosmos beyond.\n His own features lay there suddenly reflected in the desk\u0027s polished surface as though swimming out of the planet: the sensual mouth in a straight line, nostrils flared in his narrow hooked nose, dark eyes brooding under overhanging brows, the high forehead with twin coves of silvery Chem flesh in the short black hair.\n Ynvic\u0027s face came through the Central Directory\u0027s message center relays to dance above the desk and stare at him expectantly.\n \"I\u0027ve given my opinion,\" she said.\n Fraffin looked up at the Shipsurgeon, a bald, roundfaced Chem of the Ceyatril breed -- old, old even by Chem standards-extravagant with age. A thousand stars such as the sun which whirled this planet in its loop of gravity could have been born and died in the life of Shipsurgeon Ynvic. There were rumors she\u0027d been a planet buyer once and even a member of the Larra crew which had probed the other dimensions. She wouldn\u0027t say, naturally, but the story persisted.\n \"I can never sell my world, Ynvic,\" he said. \"You know that.\"\n \"A Chem is wise to avoid the word never,\" she said.\n \"What do our sources say about this Kelexel?\" he asked.\n \"That he\u0027s a rich merchant, recently allowed to breed, favored by the Primacy.\" \"And you think he\u0027s the new snooper.\"\n \"I think it.\"\n If Ynvic thinks it, then it\u0027s probably true, he thought.\n He knew he was stalling, vacillating. He didn\u0027t want to drop the lovely little war and gear the ship to meet this new threat.\n Perhaps Ynvic\u0027s right, he thought. I\u0027ve been here too long, eaten too much identification with our poor, ignorant natives.\n Another snooper from the Bureau came to watch us!\n And what the man sought could not be hidden long. Ynvic was saying that to him with every word and gesture.\n I should abandon this planet, he thought How did I absorb so much identification with these gross, stupid savages? We don\u0027t even share death in common. They die; we don\u0027t.\n I\u0027ve been one of their gods!\n What if this snooper cannot be tempted?\n Damn the Bureau!\n \"He\u0027s not going to be an easy one, this Investigator,\" Ynvic said. \"He poses as one of the very rich. If he bids on the ship why not confound them -- sell out. What could they do? You could plead ignorance; the entire ship would back you.\"\n \"Dangerous ... dangerous,\" Fraffin said.\n \"But enough profit to oppose any danger,\" she said.\n \"Any danger?\"\n \"As the parable has it,\" Ynvic said, \"the Gods smile on profit.\"\n Gods, commerce and bureaucracy, Fraffin thought. These endure, even among our poor savages. But I\u0027m trapped here, grown too much like my simple creatures. He held out his right hand, looked at the palm. My hand\u0027s in their every heritage. I\u0027m the germ of yesterday resurrecting faces out of Babylon.\n \"Kelexel has requested an interview with the great Fraffin,\" Ynvic said. \"He\u0027s been ... \"\n \"I\u0027ll see him,\" Fraffin said. He hid his palm in a clenched fist. \"Yes. Send him to me.\"\n \"No!\" Ynvic said. \"Refuse him, let your agents ... \"\n \"On what grounds? I\u0027ve seen other rich merchants.\"\n \"Any grounds. Whim, an artist\u0027s impulse, pressure of work.\"\n \"I think I shall see him. Is he internally instrumented?\"\n \"Of course not; they wouldn\u0027t be that simple. But why would you ... \"\n \"To feel him out.\"\n \"You\u0027ve professionals for that job.\"\n \"But he wants to see me.\"\n \"Here is real danger. Let him once suspect and hell not bid. He\u0027ll just snoop until he has us all in his noose.\"\n \"He may not bid anyway. Someone must find what will tempt him.\" \"We know what\u0027ll tempt him! But let him get just the faintest hint that we can interbreed with these savages, the most vague suspicion and we\u0027ve lost him ... and ourselves as well.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a child to be lectured to, Ynvic. I\u0027ll see him.\"\n \"You\u0027re determined, then?\"\n \"I am. Where is he?\"\n \"Out on the surface with a tour crew.\"\n \"Ahhh. And we\u0027re monitoring, of course. What does he think of our creatures?\"\n \"The conventional things: they\u0027re so gross, ugly -- like caricatures of Chem humanity.\"\n \"But what do his eyes say?\"\n \"The females interest him.\"\n \"Of course they do.\"\n \"Then you\u0027re going to withdraw from the war drama and set up a story for him?\"\n \"What else can we do?\" his voice revealed frustration and resignation.\n \"What\u0027ll you use, that little group in Delhi?\"\n \"No, I\u0027m saving that one for an emergency, a real emergency.\"\n \"The girls\u0027 school in Leeds?\"\n \"Inappropriate. What do you think, Ynvic -- will violence catch his mind?\"\n \"Definitely. It\u0027s the murder school in Berlin, then, eh?\"\n \"No, no! I think I have something much better, I\u0027ll discuss it after I\u0027ve seen him. As soon as he returns, have ... \"\n \"One moment,\" Ynvic said. \"Not the immune -- not that one!\"\n \"Why not? Compromise him completely.\"\n \"That\u0027s all this investigator would need! That alone without ... \"\n \"The immune can be killed at any time,\" Fraffin said.\n \"This Kelexel is not stupid!\"\n I\u0027ll be cautious.\"\n \"Just remember, old friend,\" Ynvic said, \"that I\u0027m in this as deeply as you. Most of the crew could probably get off with sentences of constructive labor, but I\u0027m the one faked the gene samples we sent the Primacy.\"\n \"I heard you,\" Fraffin said. \"The word is caution.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-2.html","bookId":1572,"book":{"id":1572,"title":"The Heaven Makers","description":"Storyline: \n The Heaven Makers is set on contemporary Earth with the one difference that we are being watched and manipulated by aliens for their viewing pleasure.
