The frustrated emotion that had built up in her out there in the night with Andy had an outlet at last. She watched the nervous twisting of Nev\u0027s pink hands with their baby- skin creases at the knuckles. She knew how his hands betrayed his feelings no matter what the masked rest of him revealed. Eight months of living with the man had given her considerable knowledge. Words came out of her full lips now like slivers of bamboo to be inserted beneath Nev\u0027s manicured soul.\\n\\n \"Scream about your husband\u0027s rights all you want,\" she said. \"The business is mine now and I don\u0027t want you anywhere near it. Ohhh, I know why you married me. You didn\u0027t fool me for long, Nev. Not for long.\"\\n\\n \"Ruth, you ... \"\\n\\n \"No more! Andy\u0027s out there waiting for me. I\u0027m going to take the few things I want here and I\u0027m leaving.\"\\n\\n Nev\u0027s wide high forehead creased. The shoe-button eyes stared at her with their matched nothingness. On one of her rampages again, that\u0027s all. And enjoying it, damn her! I can tell by the way she shakes her head like a horse ... whores ... horse ... whores --a horsey, high- class whore.\\n\\n Ruth broke her gaze away from him. Nev frightened her when he stared that way. She studied the room, wondering if there were anything here she wanted now. Nothing. It was a Nev Hudson room with overlapping muted reds and browns, Oriental bric-a-brac, a grand piano in one corner, a closed violin case that opened to reveal three bottles of liquor and a set of glasses. Nev liked that. \"Lets get drunk and make beautiful music, honey.\" Windows beyond the piano stood uncurtained to the night and garden lights, lawn, barbecue pit, wrought iron furniture standing whitely dripping after the rain.\\n\\n \"California is a community-property state,\" Nev said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better look into the law again,\" she said. \"The business is my inheritance.\"\\n\\n \"Inheritance?\" he asked. \"But your father\u0027s not dead yet.\"\\n\\n She stood staring at the night, refusing to let him goad her.\\n\\n Damn her! he thought. I should\u0027ve done better in a woman but not with a business thrown into the bargain. She\u0027s thinking about that bastard Andy Thurlow. She wants him but she needs my brains running the business. That ugly stick of a boy-man in her bed! She won\u0027t have him; I\u0027ll see to it.\\n\\n \"If you go away with this Dr. Thurlow, I\u0027ll ruin him professionally and I\u0027ll ruin you,\" he said.\\n\\n She turned her head sideways, presenting a Greek profile, the severe line of her red hair tied at the back. A barely perceptible smile touched her lips, was gone. \"Jealous, Nev?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve warned you.\"\\n\\n \"You married me for the business,\" she said. \"What do you care how I spend my time?\" And she turned toward him. Squirm, you little pig of a man! What was I thinking of? What was I ever thinking of to take you instead of Andy. Did something twist my emotions, make me do it? She felt suddenly weak with the hungry hating. Is any choice ever right right right? Andy choosing that Fellowship instead of me, his eyes full of innocence oh hateful! Where did I spend my innocence? Unthinking about animal bodies and power. Did I choose power in Nev? But he let me take it away from him his own power and now I can hate him with it.\\n\\n \"The daughter of a murderer!\" he snapped.\\n\\n She glared at him. Is this what I chose? Why why why? Lonely, that\u0027s why. All alone when Andy left men for that damned Fellowship and there was Nev Nev Nev insistent kind kind like a fox. Drunk I was drunk and feeling hateful. Nev used my hate that\u0027s the only power he had --hate my hate my hate I mustn\u0027t hate then and he\u0027s powerless I won\u0027t even hate him putting his hand on my knee oh so kind so kind and a little higher and there we were in bed married and Andy away in Denver and I was still alone.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going,\" she said. \"Andy\u0027s going to drive me over to Sarah\u0027s. If you try to stop me, I\u0027ll call him in and I\u0027m quite sure he can handle you.\"\\n\\n Nev\u0027s narrow, purse-string mouth tightened. His shoe-button eyes betrayed a brief flaring and then the mask was back in place. I\u0027ll ruin them both! The bitch prattling about Andy well I showed dear old honest Andy the boy with the built in system of honor and what would she say if she learned I was the one put on the pressure to get him that Fellowship?\\n\\n \"You know what the town\u0027ll think,\" he said. \"Like father like daughter. They\u0027ll take my side. You know that.\"\\n\\n She stamped her foot. \"You pig!\"\\n\\n Certainly, Ruth, my dear. Get angry and stamp around like a wonderful animal my god would I like to take you to bed right now angry and hurting throwing yourself and twisting and jerking my god you\u0027re splendid when you\u0027re angry. I\u0027m better for you than Andy and you should know it we\u0027re two of a kind we take what we want and damn the honor no honor no honor on her on her on her what an animal when she\u0027s angry but that\u0027s what life\u0027s for to take to take and take and take until we\u0027re filled up on it and she raves about Andy going back to him but Andy doesn\u0027t take from me no siree I\u0027ll get rid of him just as easily as I did before and Ruthy\u0027ll come crawling back to her ever loving Nev who knows her right down to her adorable most angry adorable if I only had the guts to yank you into the bedroom right now ... well, I\u0027d get rid of Andy just like I did before.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll strike a bargain,\" he said. \"Go along with your lover, but don\u0027t interfere with how I run the business. You said it yourself: what do I care how you spend your time?\"\\n\\n Go ahead, compromise yourselves, he thought. I\u0027ll own you.\\n\\n She whirled away, strode down the hall, jerked open the bedroom door, snapped on the light.\\n\\n Nev was right behind her. He stood in the doorway watching as she yanked clothes from drawers and the closet, threw them on the bed.\\n\\n \"Well, what about it?\" he asked.\\n\\n She forced words out of her mouth, knowing they told more than she wanted to reveal. \"All right! Keep the business ... or whatever. We know what\u0027s precious to you.\" She turned to face him, near tears and fighting to hide it \"You\u0027re the most hateful creature I\u0027ve ever met! You can\u0027t be human.\" She put a hand to her mouth. \"I wonder if you are.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to ... \" He broke off, stared past her toward the French doors onto the patio. \"Ruth ... \" Her name came out in a strangled gasp.\\n\\n She whirled.\\n\\n The French doors stood open to reveal three squat figures clothed in green moving into the room. To Ruth, their heads seemed strangely large, the eyes faintly luminous and frightening. They carried short tubes of silvery metal. There was a disdainful sense of power in the purposeful way they fanned out, pointing those metal tubes casually at the bedroom\u0027s occupants.\\n\\n Ruth found herself wondering with an odd feeling of surprise how they\u0027d opened the French doors without her hearing it.\\n\\n Behind her, Nev gasped, said: \"See here! Who ... \" His voice trailed off in a frightening hiss, an exhalation as though he were a punctured balloon. A liquid trilling sound poured from the mouth of the creature on Ruth\u0027s right\\n\\n This can\u0027t be happening, she thought. Then: They\u0027re the creatures who frightened us in the grove! What do they want? What\u0027re they doing?\\n\\n She found suddenly that she couldn\u0027t move. Her head felt detached, mind clear, but there were no connections to her body. One of the creatures moved to stand directly in front of her --a queer little manling in green leotards, his torso partly concealed in a cloudy, bulging roundness that pulsed with a purple inner light She remembered Andy\u0027s description of what he\u0027d seen: \"Glowing eyes ... \"\\n\\n Andy! She wanted to scream for him, but her voice wouldn\u0027t obey. How drifting and soft the world seemed!\\n\\n Something jerked past her and she saw Nev there walking as though pulled by strings. Her eyes focused on a smudge of powder along his shoulder, a pulsing vein at his temple. He tipped forward suddenly in that strange marionette way, falling rigidly into one of the open French doors. There came the crash and tinkling of broken glass. The floor around him became bright with flowing red. He twitched, lay still.\\n\\n The gnome creature in front of her spoke quite distinctly in English: \"An accident, you see?\"\\n\\n She had no voice to answer, only a distant horror somewhere within the powdery billowing that was her self. Ruth closed her eyes, thinking; Andy! Oh, Andy, help me!\\n\\n Again, she heard one of the creatures speak in that liquid trilling. She tried to open her eyes, couldn\u0027t. Waves of darkness began to wash over what remained of her awareness. As unconsciousness came, her mind focused clearly on a single oddly pertinent thought: This can\u0027t be happening because no one would believe it. This is nightmare, that\u0027s all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-heaven-makers/page-9.html","bookId":1572,"book":{"id":1572,"title":"The Heaven Makers","description":"Storyline: The Heaven Makers is set on contemporary Earth with the one difference that we are being watched and manipulated by aliens for their viewing pleasure.
