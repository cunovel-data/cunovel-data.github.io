{"id":25860,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"It was on a lovely October morning that the travellers returned to Sudley. The whole region of the sky was of so clear and deep a blue, that it seemed as if the pure cold breath of the morning had driven every cloud and vapour far from the skies of merry England. The sun shone brightly upon the yet green meadows, upon the hedges, and upon the trees with their broad branches, and their scanty brown leaves: the birds, rejoicing in the sun-light, were singing hymns of grateful melody, as they darted among the branches, or sailed and curved in the blue ether. Our fair Margaret, sympathizing in the gladness of nature, could almost have sung in concert with the feathered choir, as she tripped along with the light step that indicates a cheerful heart. She had just reached that point of the Winchcombe road where the green lane, turning to the left, led directly to her home, when, catching a glimpse of an approaching figure, she raised her eyes and beheld—Calverley. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whether Calverley\u0027s quick glance had caught the marriage ring upon her uncovered finger, or, whether the basket on her arm, together with the circumstance of her being abroad at an hour that used to be devoted to her needle, told him she was no longer a thing to be thought of with hope, or looked on with love, it is difficult to say; but he stood suddenly still, and his cheeks and lips became pale—almost livid. Margaret turned and walked hastily down the path, her pallid cheek, and trembling limbs, alone telling that she had recognized Calverley. He stood silently gazing after her, till a winding in the path, shut her out from his view. He then walked rapidly on to Winchcombe, entered the first vintner\u0027s he came to, and, to the surprise of the host, who knew Master Calverley to be a sober man, called for a measure of wine, drank it off at a draught, and throwing down the money, departed as abruptly as he came. In a few minutes after, he entered the room of old Luke, the steward Sudley Castle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Master Luke,\" said he, with an assumed carelessness of manner, \"you are rather chary of my lord\u0027s wine—you have not yet offered me the cup of welcome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ask your pardon, Calverley,\" replied the steward, \"but you so seldom care for wine, that one hardly thinks of offering it to you: here, however, is a cup that will do your heart good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Calverley took the cup, and drinking it off with as much zest as if he had not already tasted wine that morning—\"Any news?\" said he, \"master Luke—any news?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much, \u0027squire.—Stephen Holgrave, indeed, has got married, and, I\u0027ll warrant me, there will be a fine to do about it; for he has married a nief, and you know my lord is very particular about these matters:—he told me, no longer ago than just before he went away this last time, that he would not abate a jot of his due, in the marriages or services of his bond-folk. To be sure the lass is sister of the monk who now shrieves the castle, and, as my lord thinks much of Holgrave, it may all blow over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who married them?\" asked Calverley, in a stifled voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Father John, to be sure—nobody else—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did he!\" said Calverley, in a voice that made the old man start; but, before the astonished steward could reply, he burst from the room. None of the inmates of the castle saw him again during the remainder of that day. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he appeared before De Boteler the next morning, such a change had twenty hours of mental suffering produced in his countenance, that his lord, struck by the alteration, inquired if he were ill. Calverley said something about a fall that had partly stunned him, but assured De Boteler he was now perfectly well. While he yet spoke, the steward entered, to say that Stephen Holgrave had come to crave his lordship\u0027s pardon for marrying a nief without leave, and also to pay the merchet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Married a nief! has he?\" returned De Boteler. \"By my faith I thought the kern had too proud a stomach to wed a nief. I thought he had no such love for villeinage. I do not like those intermarriages. Were free maidens so scarce that this Holgrave could not find a wife among them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Calverley slightly coloured as De Boteler spoke; he knew his lord was no admirer of people stepping in the least out of their way, and it seemed probable it was to him he alluded, when he expressed his dislike of unequal marriages. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, my lord,\" said Luke, in reply to De Boteler\u0027s interrogatory, \"there is hardly a free maiden in the parish that would not have been glad of Stephen; but, though I have never seen her, I am told this wife of his is the comeliest damsel between this and Winchcombe: and, besides, she is not like a common nief—and then, my lord, she is the sister of the good monk John.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father John\u0027s sister, is she?\" asked the baron. \"Why then my good esquire here, has more to do with the matter than I—but however, Luke, go tell Holgrave I cannot attend to him now\"—\"Why, Calverley,\" continued De Boteler, when the steward had withdrawn. \"Is not this the maiden you spoke to me about? Do not turn so pale man, but answer me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord,\" replied Calverley. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And did this Holgrave dare to wed a nief of mine!—when I had already disposed of her freedom and her hand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By my faith, the knave is bold to thwart me thus.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord,\" said Calverley; \"the evening before you left the castle for London, I went to the maiden\u0027s cottage to ask her hand; Holgrave immediately came in, and I then distinctly told him that your lordship had given me the maiden\u0027s freedom, and also had consented that I should wed her, and yet, you see what regard he has paid to your will!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, this is the gratitude of these base-born vassals; but, Calverley, what priest presumed to wed them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The monk John.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! the wife\u0027s brother! He who has attended the chapel since the death of the late good father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Heavens! they seem all conspiring to set my will at nought!—he, at least should have better known what was due to the lord of this castle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The monk,\" replied Calverley, \"was not ignorant of my lord\u0027s will: and it vexes me, not on my own account, for it was merely a passing fancy; but it vexes me, that this proud, stubborn, priest, while he is eating of your bread, and drinking of your cup, should, in the teeth of your commands, do that which I could swear no other priest would have dared to do; it ill becomes him to preach obedience who——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"True, true, I will see to him—he shall answer for what he has done—but now Calverley, tell me honestly, for you are not wont to be familiar even with your fellows—tell me what you saw in this maiden that could make you wish to rival Stephen Holgrave?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her beauty, my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! is she so fair?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord, I have seldom looked upon one so fair. In my judgment she was the loveliest I ever saw in these parts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say you so!\" returned De Boteler. \"I should like to see this boasted beauty, even if it were to convince me of your taste in these matters. Calverley, order one of the varlets to go to Holgrave, and desire him to come to the castle directly—and, mind you, he brings his wife with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Calverley could scarcely repress a smile of exultation as the baron delivered this command, but composing his countenance to its general calm expression, he bowed to De Boteler, and immediately withdrew. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave, when the henchman delivered the baron\u0027s command, hesitated, and looked angrily to Margaret. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What ails thee, my son,\" asked Edith. \"Is she not thy wife?—and can the baron break asunder the bonds that bind ye?—or dost thou fear that Margaret\u0027s face may please him—and that he would strive to take from the man who saved his life in the battle, the wife of his bosom! Shame! shame!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, mother,\" returned Holgrave, musing; \"yet I would rather she should not go to the castle—I have seen more of the baron than you: and, besides, this Calverley——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave, however, considering it better not to irritate the baron by a refusal, at length consented that Margaret should accompany him, and they quitted the cottage together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come hither, Holgrave,\" said De Boteler, as Holgrave entered. \"Is this your wife?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord,\" replied the yeoman, with a humble reverence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look up, pretty one,\" said De Boteler to Margaret!—\"Now, by my faith Holgrave, I commend your choice. I wonder not that such a prize was contended for. Margaret,—I believe that is your name? Look up! and tell me in what secret place you grew into such beauty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret raised her bright blue eyes, that had been as yet hidden by the long dark lashes, and the downcast lids; but, meeting the bold fixed gaze of the baron, they were instantly withdrawn, and the deep blush of one unaccustomed to the eyes of strangers, suffused her cheek and brow, and even her neck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Were you reared on this barony, Margaret?\" resumed the baron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord,\" answered Margaret, modestly, raising her eyes: \"my mother was a freeman\u0027s daughter; my father was a bondman on this land: they died when I was but a child; and Edith Holgrave reared me till I grew up a girl and could work for myself—and then——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You thought you could not do better than wed her son through gratitude. That was well—and so this good squire of ours could not expect to find much favour in your eyes. But, do you not know, you should not have wedded without my consent?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord,\" answered Holgrave; \"I beg your pardon; but I thought your lordship wouldn\u0027t think much of the marriage, as your lordship was not at the castle, and I did not know when you would return. Here is the merchet, my lord, and I hope you will forgive me for not awaiting your return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose I must, for there is no helping it now; and by my faith, it is well you did not let me see that pretty face before you were wedded,—but take back the merchet,\" he continued, waving back with his hand, the money which Holgrave was presenting. \"Keep it. An orphan bride seldom comes rich; and here is a trifle to add to it, as a token that De Boteler prizes beauty—even though it be that of a bondwoman!\" As he spoke, he held a broad piece of gold towards Holgrave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so, my lord,\" said Holgrave, suffering the coin to remain between De Boteler\u0027s fingers.—\"Not so my lord. I take back the merchet with many thanks, but I crave your pardon for not taking your gold. I have no need of gold—I did not wed Margaret for dower—and with your lordship\u0027s leave I pray you excuse my taking it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As you please, unthankful kern,\" replied the baron, haughtily. \"De Boteler forces his gifts upon no one—here,\" he continued, throwing the piece to an attendant, who stood behind his chair—\"you will not refuse it.\" He then turned round to the table and commenced a game at cards, without further noticing Holgrave. The yeoman stood a few minutes awaiting the baron\u0027s pleasure, but perceiving he did not heed him, presently took Margaret\u0027s hand, and making a low obeisance, retired. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the game was finished, De Boteler threw down the cards. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Calverley,\" said he, \"think you that this Margaret loves her husband?\" A slight shade passed over Calverley\u0027s cheek as he answered, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should hardly think so, my lord. She is—her temper is very gentle—Holgrave is passionate, and rude, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a pity she should be the wife of such a carle\"—mused his lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n That afternoon De Boteler, throwing a plain dark cloak over his rich dress, left the castle, took the path that led to Holgrave\u0027s abode, and raising the latch, entered the cottage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret was sitting near the window at needle-work, and Edith in her high-backed arm-chair, was knitting in the chimney-corner. Margaret blushing deeply, started from her seat as her eyes so unexpectedly encountered those of the baron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep your seat, pretty dame,\" said De Boteler. \"That is a stout silk. For whom are you working these bright colours?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a stole for my brother, the monk, my lord,\" replied Margaret in a tremulous voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your work is so beautiful\" returned De Boteler, looking at the silk, \"that I wish you could find time to embroider a tabard for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord,\" replied Edith, rising from her seat and stepping forward a few paces, \"Margaret Holgrave has little leisure from attending to the household of her husband. There are abundance of skilful sempstresses; and surely the Baron de Boteler would not require this young woman to neglect the duty she has taken upon herself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n De Boteler looked at Edith an instant with a frown, as if about to answer fiercely; but after a moment he inquired calmly, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does your son find his farm answer, dame?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord, with many thanks to the donor. Stephen has all he can wish for in this farm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is well,\" returned De Boteler; and then, after a momentary but earnest gaze at Margaret, he turned away and left the cottage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave entered soon after the baron\u0027s departure. Margaret strove to meet him with a smile; but it was not the sunny glow, that usually greeted his return. He detected the effort; nay, as he bent down to kiss her cheek, he saw that she trembled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What ails you, Margaret?\" inquired he tenderly. \"You are not well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O yes,\" replied Margaret. \"I am perfectly well, but—I have been a little frightened.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By whom? Calverley?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; his master.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The baron! Surely Margaret—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Stephen,\" said Margaret, alarmed at the sudden fierceness his countenance assumed. \"Indeed he said no harm. Did he, mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" replied Edith, \"and if he had, Stephen, your wife knew how to answer him as befitting a virtuous woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was well,\" replied Holgrave; \"I am a freeman, and may go where I list, and not King Edward himself shall insult a freeman\u0027s wife!—but do not weep, Margaret, I am not angered with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening De Boteler spoke little during supper, and while drinking the second cup after the repast, he desired the page who stood behind his chair, to order the monk John to attend him directly. Father John presently appeared, and approaching the foot of the table, made a low obeisance, and then with his hands crossed on his bosom, and with eyes cast down, awaited till De Boteler should address him. De Boteler looked for a moment earnestly at the monk, ere in a stern voice he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father John, know you not why I have sent for you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord, I await your pleasure,\" replied the monk submissively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Await my pleasure!\" replied the baron scornfully. \"Did you consider my pleasure, monk, when you presumed to set at nought my prerogatives?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord,\" answered the monk, still mildly, though in a firmer tone than he had before spoken, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My Lord de Boteler, servants must obey their masters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hypocrite!\" interrupted the baron, in a voice that resounded through the hall. \"Did you consider the obedience due to a master when you presumed to dispose of a bondwoman of mine, without my sanction—nay, even in direct opposition to my will? Answer me. Did you consider the order of dependence then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Baron of Sudley,\" replied the monk, in a voice which though scarcely elevated above the ordinary pitch of colloquial discourse, was nevertheless in that clear distinct tone which is heard at a considerable distance—\"Baron of Sudley, I am no hypocrite, neither have I forgotten to render to C?sar the things that are C?sar\u0027s. If I pronounced the nuptial benediction over a bondwoman and a freeman without your lordship having consented, it was because you had first violated the trust reposed in you. You are a master to command obedience, but only in things that are not sinful; yet would you sinfully have compelled a maiden to swear at the holy altar of God to love and honour a man whom her soul abhorred. It was because you would have done this, that I, as the only being besides your lordship who could—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Insolent priest!\" interrupted De Boteler, \"do you dare to justify what you have done? Now, by my faith, if you had with proper humility acknowledged your fault and sued for pardon—pardon you should have had. But now, you leave this castle instantly. I will teach you that De Boteler will yet be master of his own house, and his own vassals. And here I swear (and the baron of Sudley uttered an imprecation) that, for your meddling knavery, no priest or monk shall ever again abide here. If the varlets want to shrieve, they can go to the Abbey; and if they want to hear mass, a priest can come from Winchcombe. But never shall another of your meddling fraternity abide at Sudley while Roland de Boteler is its lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Calverley,\" he continued, turning to the squire, who stood at a distance, enjoying the mortification of the monk—\"Calverley, see that the priest quits the castle—remember—instantly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The monk, for the first time, fully raised his eyes, and casting upon the baron a momentary glance of reproach, turned, without speaking, from the table. He walked on a few steps towards the door, and then stopping suddenly, as if recollecting that Calverley had orders to see him depart, he turned round, and looking upon the squire, who was almost at his side, he said in a stern voice, and with a frowning brow, \"I go in obedience to your master; but even obedience to your master is not to be enforced upon a servant of the Lord by such as you. Of my own will I go forth; but not one step further do I proceed till you retire!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was that in the voice and look of the monk, which made Calverley involuntarily shrink; and receiving at the same instant a glance from De Boteler, he withdrew to the upper end of the room; and father John, with a dignified step, passed on through the hall, and across the court-yard, and giving a blessing to the guard at the principal gate, who bent his knee to receive it, he went forth, having first shaken the dust from his sandals. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning, when his lord had released him from attendance, Calverley, little satisfied with the progress of his vengeance, left the castle, and walked on to meditate alone more uninterruptedly on the canker-worm within. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had not proceeded far along his path, when the heavy tread of a man on the rustling leaves, caused him to raise his eyes, and he saw a short, thickset figure, in grey woollen hose, and a vest of coarse medley cloth reaching no higher than the collar-bone, hastening onward. A gleam of hope lighted Calverley\u0027s face as he observed this man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is the matter this morning, Byles?\" said he, \"you look troubled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Byles looked at Calverley for an instant, perfectly astonished at his condescension. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Troubled!\" replied he—\"no wonder. My farm is bad; and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a poor farm,\" said Calverley hastily; \"but there are many fine farms that have lately reverted to my lord in default of heirs, or as forfeitures, that must soon be given away or sold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Master Calverley, what is that to me?\" said Byles, looking with some surprise at the squire—\"you know I am a friendless man, and have not wherewithal to pay the fine the steward would demand for the land. No, no, John Byles is going fast down the hill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t despair, Byles—there is Holgrave—he was once poorer than you—take heart, some lucky chance may lift you up the hill again. I dare say this base-born I have named thinks himself better now than the free-born honest man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, that he does, squire: to be sure he doesn\u0027t say any thing; but then he thinks the more; and, besides, he never comes into the ale-house when his work is done, to take a cheering draught like other men. No, no, he is too proud for that; but home he goes, and whatever he drinks he drinks at his own fireside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment Calverley\u0027s brow contracted; but striving to look interested for the man he wished to conciliate, he replied, \"Yes, Byles, it is a pity that a good-hearted yeoman like you should not prosper as well as a mere mushroom. Now, Byles, I know you are a discreet man, and I will tell you a piece of news that nobody about the barony has yet heard. My lord is going to be married—yes, Byles, he leaves Sudley in a few days, and goes again to London, and he will shortly return with a fair and noble mistress for the castle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We shall have fine doings then,\" said Byles, in an animated tone, and with a cheerful countenance; not that the news was of particular moment to him, but people love to be told news; and, besides, the esquire\u0027s increasing familiarity was not a little flattering. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" replied Calverley; \"there will be fine feasting, and I will see, Byles, that you do not lack the best. Who knows but your dame may yet nurse the heir of this noble house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am afraid not,—many thanks to you; John Byles is not thought enough of in this barony—no, it is more likely Holgrave\u0027s wife, if she has any children, will have the nursing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! Margaret Holgrave?—never\"—said Calverley, with such a look and tone, that the yeoman started, and felt convinced, that what he had heard whispered about the esquire\u0027s liking for Margaret was true: \"but, however,\" added Calverley, in a moment recovering his self-possession, \"do not despair, Byles. My lord tells me I shall replace old Luke as steward in a few months, and if I do, there is not a vassal I should be more inclined to favour than you; for I see, Byles, there is little chance of your doing good unless you have a friend; for you are known to the baron as an idle fellow, and not over-scrupulous of telling a falsehood. Nay, my man, don\u0027t start, I tell you the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, but squire, how could the baron hear of this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps Stephen Holgrave could answer——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The base-born kern,\" replied Byles, fiercely; \"he shall answer——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t say he told the Baron,\" said Calverley; \"but I believe Holgrave loves to make every body look worse than himself; and to be plain with you, John Byles, I love him not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir, I believe you have little reason to love him any more than other people—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Byles,\" interrupted Calverley, speaking rapidly, \"you are poor—you are in arrear with your rent; a distress will be levied, and then what will become of you—of your wife and the little one? Listen to me! I will give you money to keep a house over your head; and when I am steward, you shall have the first farm at my lord\u0027s disposal, if you will only aid me in my revenge! Revenge!\" he repeated, vehemently—\"but you hesitate—you refuse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, nay, squire, I don\u0027t refuse: your offer is too tempting for a man in my situation to refuse; but you know—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" interrupted Calverley, with a contemptuous smile—\"well, well, Byles, I see you prefer a jail for yourself, and beggary and starvation for your wife and child. Aye—perhaps to ask bread from Stephen Holgrave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask bread from him!—of the man who crows over us all, and who has told my lord that I am a liar! No, no, I would sooner die first. I thank you for your kindness, Master Calverley, and I will do any thing short of——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you need not pause,\" interrupted Calverley, \"I do not want you to do him any bodily harm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you?—oh! well, then, John Byles is yours,\" said he, with a brightening countenance: \"for you see I don\u0027t mind saying any thing against such a fellow as he.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Byles, and especially since you will not be asked to say it for nothing,\" returned Calverley with a slight sarcastic smile; but immediately assuming a more earnest and friendly tone, he continued, \"I have promised you gold, and gold you shall have. I will befriend you to the utmost of my power, and you know my influence is not small at the castle; but you must swear to be faithful. Here,\" said he, stooping down and taking up a rotten branch that lay at his feet, and, breaking it in two, he placed it in the form of a cross. \"Here, Byles, swear by this cross to be faithful.\" Byles hesitated for an instant, and then, in rather a tremulous voice, swore to earn faithfully his wages of sin. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was nearly four months subsequent to the departure of De Boteler from the castle, ere Byles proceeded to earn the gold which had, in some measure, set him to rights with the world. It was about the middle of March;—the morning had risen gloomily, and, from a dense mass of clouds, a slow heavy rain continued to pour during the whole of the day. \"Sam,\" said Byles to a servitor, a faithful stupid creature, with just sufficient intellect to comprehend and obey the commands of his master.—\"Sam, if this rain continues we must go to work to-night?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rain did continue, and, after Byles had supped, he sat at the fire for two or three hours, and scarcely spoke. His countenance was troubled;—the deed he had promised to do—which he had contemplated with almost indifference, was now about to be accomplished; and he felt how different it is to dwell upon the commission of a thing, and actually to do it. Frequent draughts of ale, however, in some measure restored the tone of his nerves; and, as the evening wore away, he rose from the fire, and, opening the door, looked out at the weather. A thick drizzling rain still fell; the moon was at the full; and though the heavy clouds precluded the possibility of her gladdening the earth, yet even the heavy clouds could not entirely obscure her light;—there was a radiance spread over the heavens which, though wanting the brightness of moonlight, was nevertheless equal and shadowless. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis a capital night,\" said Byles, as he looked up at the sky in a tone of soliloquy; \"I could not have wished for a better—just light enough to see what we are about, and not enough to tell tales. Sam,\" continued he, closing the door and sitting again at the fire, \"bring me the shafts and let me look if the bow is in order.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The serving man took from a concealed place a couple of arrows, and a stout yew-tree bow, and handed them to his master. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did well, Sam, in getting these shafts from Holgrave. You put the quiver up safe?—there is no fear of his missing them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think not, master. It would be hard if he missed two out of four-and-twenty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary,\" said Byles, addressing his wife, \"put something over the casement, lest if, by chance, any body should be abroad, they may see that we are up:—and now, bring me the masks. Never fear, Mary, nobody is out such a night as this. Now Sam,\" he continued, \"fetch the hand-barrow and let us away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary began to tremble;—she caught her husband by the arm, and said something in a low and tremulous voice. As the fire revealed her face, Byles started at the strange paleness it exhibited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What ails you, Mary?\" said he. \"Have you not all along urged me to this? and now, after taking Calverley\u0027s gold, and spending it, and signing the bond, you want me to stand still! No, no, I must go to the Chase this night, were I sure to be hung to-morrow morning!\" He then pushed her away with some violence, and the servitor preceding him, he passed over the threshold and closed the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n They entered the Chase—and the wind, as it came in sudden gusts through the branches of the tall trees, gave an air of deeper gloom to the night. Frequently they paused and listened, as if fearful of being discovered; and then, when convinced that no human being was near, hastened on to the spot where the deer usually herded at night. A deep ravine, ten or twelve feet in breadth, intersected the Chase at a few paces from the inclosure; and, about a stone\u0027s throw to the right of this inclosure, stood the dwelling of the keeper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sam,\" said Byles, \"is not that a light in the cottage?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, master, but I think they are in bed, and may be have forgotten to rake the ashes over the fire.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be so,\" answered Byles, doubtfully; \"keep in the shade of the trees, and let us stop awhile—I do not much like this light.\" They watched the cottage anxiously, and, in about twenty minutes, the light disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sam,\" said Byles, \"I believe you were right—that last faint flicker, I doubt not, came from the dying embers. Creep softly to the inclosure, and gently rustle the brushwood. Don\u0027t let them see you. Softly—there—go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Byles drew his shaft from beneath his garment, and fixed it in the bow as Sam crept into the inclosure and did what he was ordered. The animals started on their legs, and stretched their heads forward in various directions, as if to ascertain whence the danger seemed to threaten. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down, Sam, a little to the left,\" whispered Byles, as a noble buck bounded forward towards the servitor, who had sheltered himself so as to avoid being seen by the animal. Sam dropt on the drenched grass to avoid the shaft that now sped from the bow of the marksman. The arrow entered the neck of the affrighted creature, as, for an instant, it stood with upraised head, its lofty antlers touching the branches. It then bounded forward, but, in its giddy effort to clear the obstruction of the opposing chasm, fell gasping among the brushwood that lined the sides of the ravine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound him, he has escaped us!\" exclaimed Byles. \"See the whole herd scudding off, as if the hounds were in full cry at their heels. But forward, Sam, and creep to the edge, for he may not have fallen into the stream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sam obeyed; but whether owing to his trepidation or the slippery surface of the earth, he lost his footing and disappeared, uttering a cry of terror. Byles stood for an instant, irresolute whether to advance to the succour of his servitor, or leave him behind, for he apprehended that the cry would arouse the guardians of the Chase. Recollecting, however, that it would be as dangerous to abandon him as to attempt his extrication, he rushed forward to the spot where Sam had disappeared. The man had, in his fall, grasped the root of a tree from which the late heavy rains had washed the earth, and he lay suspended midway down. Byles hastily threw him a rope, with which he had intended to bind the animal on the barrow, and, with some difficulty, succeeded in dragging him up. \\n\\n \\n\\n The dying throes of the buck recalled Byles to the object of his journey; and they were about making an effort to extricate the animal from the brushwood, when the servitor\u0027s eye caught the gleam of a light in the cottage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all over,\" said Byles, in a disappointed tone; \"but the arrow may answer our purpose where it is. Take up the barrow and fly, but keep in the shade of the trees.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A quick knock aroused Mary from her seat at the fire. She approached the door on tiptoe, and hesitated a moment ere she unclosed it; but the rapid breathings of Byles relieved her alarm, and she opened it hastily. A pale, haggard look met her eyes as her husband rushed in. \"Fasten the door, Mary,\" said he—\"haste, quench the fire. Here, put these wet clothes in the hiding place\"—stripping himself of his garments—\"and when you have done, hasten to bed. I am afraid they have overtaken poor Sam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" said Mary, dropping the clothes, and staggering to a seat—\"oh! Byles, Byles, we are lost! What will become of us! Sam will tell all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold your tongue, woman,\" said Byles, jumping out of the bed into which he had thrown himself, and taking up the clothes, concealed them in the pit. \"Do you want to have me hanged? To bed, I tell you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She tremblingly obeyed, and Byles listened with breathless anxiety for the signal that would assure him of his servant\u0027s safety. At length a footstep and a low tap at the door summoned Byles from his bed. \"Who is there?\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hasten, master, open the door,\" answered the servitor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All is well; Sam is returned!\" He opened the door, and the servitor panting with fear and fatigue, threw the barrow on the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, Sam; there is nothing left to tell we have been in the Chase to-night. Now hasten to bed as quickly as you can. You shall have a new suit at Easter for this night\u0027s business. But Master Calverley will not be well pleased that the buck was not lodged in Holgrave\u0027s barn. However, it cannot be helped now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2091/59336.html","bookId":525,"book":{"id":525,"title":"The Bondman A Story of the Times of Wat Tyler","description":"简介： The idea of the following tale was suggested on reading the first volume of Robertson\u0027s Charles the Fifth, on the Feudal Policy of Germany; and the picture of moral and political debasement presented in those pages, whether as regards the oppressor o...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2091","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
