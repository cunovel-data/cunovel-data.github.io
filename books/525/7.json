{"id":25864,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI.","content":"\\n\\n On the evening succeeding the day of Edith\u0027s decease, Black Jack\u0027s associates were, as usual, squandering away their ill-got money at the Mitre. A ribald song was just concluded, when a loud knock caught the attention of the foreman: the door was opened, and the galleyman entered. His countenance looked pale and haggard, and without speaking, he threw himself in a chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What ails you, man?\" inquired Black Jack—\"you look the worse for your long fast—here, drink,\" handing him a full pitcher. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want no drink,\" said the galleyman, impatiently, pushing away the vessel—\"but stay, \u0027t will do me no harm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He then snatched the pitcher and drank a full quart ere he removed it from his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Master Oakley,\" said he, \"you played me false in this game. Do ye think if I hadn\u0027t been fool enough to believe what you and that master sheriff told me, I would have given in till poor Edith Holgrave had slipt her cable. Did you not swear to me,\" added he fiercely, \"that the law could not touch her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"True, O king; and though the judge did a queer thing in her case, yet the woman died like a Christian in her bed after all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she buried like a Christian?\" passionately interrogated the stranger. \"No,\" he continued, in a quieter tone, \"she was buried last night in the high road without kyste or shroud, or prayer, just as one would throw a dead dog overboard: but there is no use talking now—this is not what I came for. I came to ask if ye will give me a hand to get her out again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To dig up the old witch out of the grave!\" inquired the foreman with a stare of astonishment. \"To unearth a dead body! By the green wax! man, your long fast has touched your brain!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said the galleyman, gravely. \"I am as sound and as sober as ever I was; and, mind you, (casting a quick glance round the table) I don\u0027t want any one to work for nothing—here, (he said, taking a small leathern purse from his pocket) is what will pay, and I shall be no niggard. You shall have money and drink too—speak! will you assist? There is no time to lose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What say you, brethren?\" resumed the foreman, looking at the rest: \"our friend served us—and besides, it is a pity to let good things go a-begging.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The brethren felt no great appetite for a job so much out of their way—and sundry hems! and awkward gesticulations expressed their reluctance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose we do assist,\" drawled out Harvey and three or four others; \"who is to remove the body?\" the galleyman hastily answered, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Leave it to me—I fear not the dead—though if the old woman started from the grave, she could owe me no good will. Would you lend a hand if this Calverley should bear down upon us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, aye,\" said Harvey, with some shew of courage; \"we don\u0027t mind, unless the odds are against us, and in that case, you know, we must retreat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What!\" said Black Jack, laughing, \"think you squire Calverley would busy himself about the dead! Come, come, tell out the silver, and replenish the flagon: we are yours for this adventure—and, by the green wax! a strange one it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sum agreed upon was paid; the liquor furnished and freely circulated; and the galleyman, now relieved from a weight that had oppressed him, gradually became cheerful. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was about midnight when the party set out, well armed and muffled in large cloaks, and in less than two hours arrived within view of Winchcombe. Here, without entering the town, they turned into a lane branching off to the left, that led to Hailes Abbey, and down this avenue the galleyman piloted his companions. The way was narrow—at least two only could ride abreast—with a hedge on each side, and here and there the picturesque branches of a well-grown elm, displaying at this season (in the daylight) the soft green of the budding leaves. They had proceeded in silence about half a mile, when the galleyman suddenly paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yonder,\" he said, pointing to the end of the lane, \"where you see the moonlight full on the ground—must be the place—at least it cannot be far off, for there the roads meet. There is this lane and the road straight ahead to Hailes—then away to the right takes you to Sudley Castle and the other end of Winchcombe; and the road this way, elevating his left hand, leads on to Bishop\u0027s Cleave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you have brought nothing to put the body in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I brought a winding-sheet,\" replied the stranger; \"and when the grave is dug, and the coast clear, I\u0027ll wrap it round poor Edith, and lay her in my cloak—and ye will hold the corners.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O yes,\" returned Black Jack; \"we won\u0027t go from our promise. But where do you mean to take her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Hailes.—But when all is ready, I must go up the lane yonder,\" pointing to the right—\"\u0027tis but a step, and fetch Stephen Holgrave—and the poor fellow shall go with us to see his mother buried as she ought to be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The party then dismounting, secured their horses to the hedge; and, concealing their faces by masks of parchment, smeared over with paint, proceeded to the end of the lane: but a sudden exclamation from the galleyman, who was a little in advance, arrested the steps of all. \\n\\n \\n\\n The moon was standing round and bright in a sky gemmed with stars, and, as the rover had just said, her beams fell unshadowed upon the open space where the roads met;—and here, directly in the centre, two dark figures were revealed. One was kneeling, while the other stood erect, holding at arm\u0027s length a cross. The galleyman gasped for breath as he drew closer to his companions, who, concealed in the shade of the hedge, looked eagerly at the objects of their alarm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are they spirits?\" asked the stranger in a subdued and terrified tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O yes, my brave heart!\" said the foreman, with something of ridicule; \"they are spirits, but spirits in the flesh—like good wine in stout bottles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, aye,\" said Harvey, encouraged by the unembarrassed manner of his leader; \"they are spirits I\u0027ll warrant, that can be laid by swords and staves instead of prayers!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The galleyman breathed freer at this united testimony that he had nought to fear—for he feared none of this world;—and as he still gazed, almost entirely relieved from his superstitious dread, he observed the extended arm of the upright figure gradually fall to his side, as if his prayer or invocation had ended, and he stooped as if addressing his companion; but the latter still maintained his kneeling posture. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It must be Stephen,\" said he, mentally; \"he is mourning over his mother. Comrades,\" he said, turning to the others, \"it is but the woman\u0027s son: at any rate there are but two. I\u0027ll go and hail them; and if ye see me stop, ye can come forward with the shovels.\" The galleyman went forward; but the moment he left the shade, his figure caught the eyes of him who stood erect. He spoke to the other, who, instantly starting on his feet, prepared himself to meet the intruder. The stranger, nothing daunted, hurried on, and, in an instant, stood before those who, by the menacing attitude they assumed, evidently regarded him with no friendly feeling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is no enemy bearing down upon you, friends,\" said the galleyman, in that tone of confidence which seems neither to suspect or purpose ill. \"Tell me, is either of you the son of her who—who lies here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why ask you?\" replied the taller figure, in a deep commanding voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will not answer till I am answered: but this I may say, be ye who ye will, that there is not a man I would befriend sooner than Stephen Holgrave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you are a friend, I will trust you; and if not, I do not fear you,\" said Holgrave, raising the brim of a slouched hat that had shadowed his face—\"I am Stephen Holgrave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then may luck attend you,\" answered the galleyman, grasping his hand; \"I thought it was you, and I came, not alone, for I have helpmates yonder to—to—do, what I thought would be a good turn for you—to bury your mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is an act of charity, stranger, to bury the dead,\" said father John courteously; \"and you are calling down mercy upon your soul like that pious man of old——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, and I have need of mercy,\" returned the galleyman, \"more need than he, whoever he was. But see, my mates are coming;—we must fall to work, for the night is wearing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But who may you be, stranger, who thus interest yourself for the injured?\" asked the monk, \"or why this disguise?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is of no consequence who I am: and as to this mask, why! a man can work as well with it as without it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The approach of Black Jack and three of the others (the fourth had been left with the horses) prevented any farther conversation; and, throwing aside their cloaks, the galleyman and the three jurors instantly commenced clearing the grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave drew the brim of his hat again over his face, and folding his arms, looked silently on as the work proceeded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the green wax!\" said Black Jack, approaching at this instant, \"as I stood yonder, reconnoitring the ground, a man shewed his head behind that ruined wall!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis the fiend Calverley, or one of his imps,\" exclaimed Holgrave, springing forward to the broken wall; but if any object had really presented itself, it had, in a singular manner, disappeared—for Holgrave, after a few minutes of anxious search, returned without having discovered the trace of a human being. \\n\\n \\n\\n The body of Edith had been raised during his absence, and, with the winding-sheet wrapped around the clothes in which it had been laid in the earth, was just placed in the galleyman\u0027s cloak when Holgrave came up. An involuntary cry burst from the yeoman as he threw himself upon the ground beside the corpse, and, removing the cloth, passionately kissed the hands and the forehead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stephen Holgrave,\" cried the monk, sternly, \"where is thy fortitude?—you have broken your word. Has thy manhood left thee?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She was my mother!\" said the mourner, rising. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he had retired, the chasm was hastily filled up; and then Black Jack, the galleyman, and two other jurors, took each a corner of the cloak, and, preceded by the monk, reciting in a low voice the prayers for the dead, and followed by Holgrave and the remaining jurors, leading the horses, proceeded at a quick pace to the church-yard of Hailes Abbey. \\n\\n \\n\\n In little more than half an hour, they arrived at the meadow in which stood the parish church and the abbey of Hailes. The church, a small, plain Gothic building, with a red tiled roof, stood in the centre of a burial-ground, of dimensions adapted to the paucity of inhabitants in the parish. A low stone wall enclosed it, and some old beech-trees threw their shadows upon the mounds and the grave-stones that marked where \"the rude fore-fathers of the hamlet\" slept. \\n\\n \\n\\n Father John went forward, and, pushing open a wooden gate, led the way to the osier-girt mound and head-stone over the grave of Holgrave\u0027s father. The body was deposited on the grass, and a space cleared of sufficient depth to receive it. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the mean time, Holgrave had conducted those in charge of the horses to an old barn at a short distance, and then returned to the church-yard; and when the deceased was lowered into the grave, the yeoman knelt at the head, the galleyman and Harvey at each side, and Father John, standing at the foot, pronounced, in a low but audible voice, the prayers usual on interment. The moonbeams fell on the church, so as to cast a far shadow upon the ground that lay towards the abbey; the foot of the grave was within the shadow, so that Father John\u0027s figure was little revealed; and the branches of a tree (against whose broad trunk Black Jack leant) concealed Harvey, and cast a trembling shadow upon that side; but the light streamed full upon Holgrave and upon the galleyman, who was kneeling at his right hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this instant, an arrow whizzed past Holgrave, and struck fire from the opposite wall. The yeoman sprang upon his feet; another shaft was sped, but instead of the object for which it was intended, pierced the hat of the foreman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the green wax!\" cried Oakley, as he lifted the perforated hat from the grass, \"we shall need more graves, if we stand here for marks. Come round, and stoop close to the wall, and the trees and grave-stones may ward off the shafts. If they will, let them come to close quarters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You counsel wisely, stranger,\" said the monk, passing round, and standing in the shadow of the tree on the left of Holgrave, whom he forced to retire and crouch like the rest. \\n\\n \\n\\n As this was accomplished, a third shaft tore the bark from the tree; and in an instant after, Calverley, followed by some of his myrmidons, sprung down from an aperture of the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sacrilege!\" shouted he—\"sacrilege! Take them, dead or alive!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave rushed on the steward, and the clash of steel rang through the church-yard. \\n\\n \\n\\n The assailants, however, were somewhat damped by a loud blast from the foreman\u0027s horn, which was instantly echoed by one of his men; and the tramping of horses in the direction of the gate increased the panic. The retainers of Sudley at length retreated more speedily than they had approached, pursued by the galleyman and Harvey, who had burst from their concealment on perceiving them enter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Byles, who was of the party, but had hitherto looked on as a spectator, (being determined to allow the steward and the yeoman to fight it out,) now glared fiercely around in search of an adversary. A cry from Calverley, however, drew him unwillingly to his assistance, and he sprang to the spot; but his uplifted arm was seized by a giant grasp, the axe wrenched from his hands, and himself hurled violently to the earth. \\n\\n \\n\\n A strange sensation thrilled through the heart of the excited monk—an impulse to shed blood! The weapon of the prostrate Byles was snatched from the earth—it waved fiercely round his head; nature and religion warred, for an instant, in his bosom, but the latter triumphed: the weapon was flung to a distance; and Father John, crossing himself, disappeared among the tombs. \\n\\n \\n\\n The combatants were as yet little hurt, for each was well skilled in the use of his weapon; but the steward, in endeavouring to ward off a blow that might have cleft his head, only succeeded at the sacrifice of his right ear, which was severed by the descending blade; and, ere he could recover this shock, Holgrave sprang within his guard, and wrenched the sword from his hand. A brief but fierce struggle ensued, in which Holgrave, at length, prevailed—the steward was thrown backward to the ground, and the next moment his enemy\u0027s hand was on his throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mer-c-c-y! mer-c-c-y! oh! mercy, Stephen Holgrave!\" gasped he, as, with a despairing effort, he attempted to unloose the death-hold. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes! mercy, Stephen—mercy to the coward!\" exclaimed the galleyman; \"he is not worth your vengeance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mercy! he had little mercy for her,\" muttered Holgrave, bitterly, as he tightened his grasp. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment, the voice of the monk was heard, as he rang the abbey bell, shouting \"Murder! sacrilege! Ho! porter! murder!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave, struck with awe, relinquished his hold, and Black Jack and his jurors instantly fled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fly, knaves!\" cried the galleyman, addressing Byles and Calverley, as he released the latter. \"And now, meddling steward, if you attempt to interfere with her who is in that holy berth yonder, or injure the honest yeoman, her son, for this night\u0027s doings, the Lord have mercy upon you! Here, Stephen,\" (walking towards Holgrave, who had thrown himself beside the grave,) \"up, and jump behind on my horse, for the cry of sacrilege will edge their brands, and friend or foe will have little chance. There—the abbey-gate is thrown open, and out they come with brand and torch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God speed you!\" cried Holgrave, as the galleyman turned away, and grasped his hand: \"God speed you! and reward you for this night: and if ever you or yours are in want of a friend, remember Stephen Holgrave.\" The galleyman hastily pressed the extended hand, and, springing to the gate, was in an instant on his horse, and galloping in the track of his companions, pursued, but in vain, by the arrows of the abbey retainers. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Calverley saw his lord after this transaction, the scene, much to the amazement of the former, partook more of comedy than tragedy, for De Boteler, when he saw the head of his esquire minus the ear, could not refrain from laughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meddling knave!\" said he, \"why did you interfere? The woman was dead—what more would you have? Did you understand it to be the custom of the lord of Sudley to war with dead enemies?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This mortification only added fuel to the steward\u0027s wrath, and he determined to carry on, with all the vigour of soul and purse, an action which he had already commenced against his enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Towards the end of June the sessions commenced at Gloucester, and Holgrave once more stood in the hall of justice—not as a looker on, but as an actor. Although, at the present period, the charge would have assumed a truly formidable shape, yet the deed was not then accounted even as maihem—for the simple reason, that the loss of an ear did not prevent a man from performing military duties. \\n\\n \\n\\n But in this instance the offence was aggravated, at least in the eye of the law, by the manner and occasion. The law had not as yet contemplated the evasion of its decisions, by the disinterment of the bodies of criminals, and, consequently, there was no provision for punishing the deed. It was, however, taken into account in the verdict, and the damages were proportionably heavy. Holgrave, as may readily be imagined, had not a coin to meet the demand, and his crops, which had grown and flourished, as if by miracle—for they had been little indebted to his attention—were now condemned to be cut down, and put up for sale to pay the damages. The yeoman had often looked upon his plentiful fields with a feeling of pleasure: not that his mind had latterly been in a mood to find pleasure in the prospect of gain; but his house and his land were mortgaged, (for his mother,) and even in the darkest and most troubled scene, there is a beauty, a redeeming brightness, encircling the domestic hearth,—nay, perhaps, the heart clings more closely to home, and treasures, more fondly, the little nameless pleasures, and even the cares and anxieties of domestic life, in proportion to the bleakness of the prospect without. \\n\\n \\n\\n His farm itself was at length forfeited, and Holgrave took shelter for the moment at old Hartwell\u0027s. The hut his father had reared when he married his mother, was still standing; the roof had fallen in, the ivy had grown over its walls; but even yet it sometimes sheltered the wandering mendicant, and often would the blaze of a large wood fire look cheerily through the shattered casement and the broken door, and shed an air almost of comfort over the bare walls. Holgrave remembered the ruin, as he was considering where he could abide until Margaret, who was far advanced in the family way, should be enabled to travel farther. His resolution was instantly formed; and refusing the assistance offered by Hartwell, and some other neighbours, and as decidedly rejecting the idea they proposed, of striving to regain possession of his house, he requested Lucy Hartwell to look to Margaret for a day or two, while he sought out a place to shelter them; and then, without mentioning his purpose, quitted the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was late in the afternoon ere Holgrave resolved to put the hut that had sheltered him when a boy, in a state to receive him now; but there were several hours of daylight before him, and even when the day should close, the broad harvest moon would afford him light to prolong his labour. The rushes that grew by the Isborne, the clay from the little spot of ground attached to the hut, and the withered and broken branches that lay thickly strewn over the adjoining forest, gave him ample materials for his purpose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave set about his task with that doggedness of purpose which persons of his disposition display when compelled to submit. His misfortunes had in some measure subdued a pride that could never be entirely extinguished;—it might be likened to a smothered fire, still burning, although diffusing neither heat nor light, but ready upon the slightest breath to burst forth in flame. Even here he was interrupted by a visitor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good even, Stephen,\" said Wat Turner, the parish smith, in as kind a tone as his abrupt manner could assume; \"you are hard at work, master—are you going to set the old cot to rights?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave answered carelessly, and without looking at the smith, continued his work. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you are doing well, Stephen, not to allow the idle vagabonds to house here any longer. By St. Nicholas! when these holes are stopped up, and the thatch is put to rights, and the casement whole, and a couple of hinges put to the door, it will be a place fit for any man. When I go home I will send my son Dick, and the knave Tom, to help you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You need not trouble yourself,\" replied Holgrave: \"what I want to do I can do myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Turner looked at Holgrave, as if he meant to resent the unsociable manner in which the reply was uttered; but speedily recollecting himself— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t blame you, Stephen,\" said he, \"you have had enough to sour any man\u0027s temper; nevertheless, I shall send Dick if I can find him; and Tom is a famous hand at thatching, and I will step over myself in the morning with the hinges and a latch for the door. But harkee, Stephen, if you wish to keep your own house, only say the word, and myself, and one or two more, will beat the old miser and his men to powder, if they don\u0027t give it up again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was so much of good feeling in this rude speech, that Holgrave turned to the smith and grasped his hard hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush! man,\" interrupted the smith, as his friend attempted to thank him; \"say nothing for the present; only remember, if Wat Turner, or any belonging to him, can lend you a hand, just say the word, or come over to my forge and give me a nod, and we\u0027ll be with you in a twinkling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One morning, about a month after this, Margaret had as usual prepared her husband\u0027s dinner. The frugal meal was spread by eleven o\u0027clock, but Holgrave came not: twelve arrived, and then one, and two, and the dinner was still upon the table untasted. Margaret was first surprised and then alarmed, but when another hour had passed away, she started up with the intention of going to seek her husband. At this moment, Holgrave pushed open the door, and entering, threw himself upon a seat. There was a wildness in his eyes, and his face looked pale and haggard. It occurred to Margaret, that he had probably partaken of some ale with a neighbour, and having neglected his customary meal, that the beverage had overcome him. However, he looked so strangely, that she forbore to question him. He bent forward, and resting his elbows on his knees, buried his face in his upraised hands, and sat thus, ruminating on something that Margaret\u0027s imagination arrayed in every guise that could torture or distress. At length he raised his head, and looking on his wife with more of sorrow than anger— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was right, Margaret,\" said he, \"it was Calverley that set the usurer upon taking the land. He gave the miser something handsome, and John Byles is to have it upon an easy rent!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"John Byles, Stephen?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Margaret,\" replied Holgrave, \"John Byles is to have it; he told the smith so himself. But,\" he continued, sitting upright in his chair, and then starting upon his feet,—\"does he think he shall keep it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret shuddered, as she looked in his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n That night, the freemen and serfs that dwelt on the estate of De Boteler, and even the inmates of the castle itself, were alarmed by the sudden glare of red flames rising in a bright column above the tallest trees, and so fiercely burned the flame, that in a few minutes the horizon was tinged with a ruddy glow. There was an eager rush to discover from whence the phenomenon arose, and many were the exclamations, and many the whispered surmises, when it was ascertained that the cottage was on fire from which Holgrave had been so recently ejected. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen stood at the door of his hut, looking with an air of derision on the vain efforts of the people to extinguish the flames; and Margaret wept as she saw the flames rising, and brightening, and consuming the house, which she still loved to look upon even now that it was for ever lost to her. The roof at length fell in, and myriads of burning particles sparkling like diamonds, showered for a moment in glittering beauty. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holgrave was still looking on the conflagration that had in a great measure spent its fury, when Wat Turner came up to him, and applying a hearty smack on the shoulder— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A famous house-warming for John Byles,\" said he. \"By Saint Nicholas! I wish his furniture had been in to have made the fire burn brisker. \u0027Tis almost over now; there it goes down, and then it comes up again, by fits and starts: \u0027tis a pity, too, to see the house which stood so snugly to-day, a black and smoky ruin to-morrow; but better a ruin, than a false heart to enjoy it. By Saint Nicholas! \u0027twill give the old gossips talk for the whole week. Aye, \u0027tis all over now; there will still be a spark and a puff now and then; but there\u0027s nothing to see worth keeping the karles any longer from their beds, and I think it is time that we be in ours—so good night. But a word with you, Stephen;—you did the business yourself this time without help; but mind you, if ever Wat Turner can lend you a hand, you have only to say so—Good night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good night,\" replied Holgrave, though without moving his eyes from the now darkly-smoking ruin; and there he stood with unchanging gaze till the sky had entirely lost its ruddy hue, and the smouldering embers of the cottage could no longer be distinguished; and then he entered his dwelling, and, closing the door, threw himself upon his bed—but not to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2091/59340.html","bookId":525,"book":{"id":525,"title":"The Bondman A Story of the Times of Wat Tyler","description":"简介： The idea of the following tale was suggested on reading the first volume of Robertson\u0027s Charles the Fifth, on the Feudal Policy of Germany; and the picture of moral and political debasement presented in those pages, whether as regards the oppressor o...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2091","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
