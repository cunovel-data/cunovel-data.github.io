I worked a double shift yesterday. We were both in school all day today and didn\u0027t even see each other until tonight, but we were with Layken. I pulled her aside earlier and told her I wanted to talk to her later. I have a feeling she thinks it\u0027s bad. She hasn\u0027t said much to me since then.\"\n \"Well, she\u0027ll be-\"\n \"Will!\" Gavin yells. My first instinct is to slam on the breaks, but I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m slamming on the breaks. I glance at Gavin and his eyes are glued to the oncoming traffic in the lanes to the left of us. I turn my head and see it just as the truck crosses the median and hits the car in front of us.\n Lake\u0027s car.\n Part Two\n Thursday, January 26th, 2012\n Chapter Twelve\n I open my eyes, but don\u0027t hear anything right away. It\u0027s cold, though. I feel wind. And glass. Glass is on my shirt. Then I hear Caulder.\n \"Will!\" he screams.\n I turn around. Caulder and Kel both look fine, but they\u0027re panicking and trying to get out of their seat belts. Kel looks terrified. He\u0027s crying and yanking on the car door.\n \"Kel, don\u0027t get out of the car. Stay in the backseat.\" My hand goes up to my eye and I pull my fingers back and there\u0027s blood on them.\n I\u0027m not sure what just happened. We must have been hit. Or we ran off the road. The back windshield is busted out and there\u0027s glass all over the car. The boys don\u0027t look cut anywhere. I look at Gavin and he\u0027s swinging his door open. He tries to jump out of the car but he\u0027s stuck in his seatbelt. He\u0027s frantic, trying to unlatch. I reach over and push the button, releasing his seatbelt for him. He trips as he lunges out of the car, but catches himself with his hands and pushes himself back up and runs. What is he running from? My eyes follow him as he runs around the car next to us. He\u0027s gone. I can\u0027t see him. I lean my head back into the headrest and close my eyes. What the hell just happened?\n \"Lake!\" I yell as soon as it hits me. I swing open the car door and get hung up in the seatbelt just like Gavin did. When I free myself, I run. I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m running to. It\u0027s dark, it\u0027s snowing and there are cars everywhere. Headlights everywhere.\n \"Sir, are you okay? You need to sit down, you\u0027re hurt.\" A man grabs my arm and tries to pull me aside but I yank my arm away from him and keep running. There are pieces of glass and metal all over the highway. My eyes dart from one side of the road to the other, but I can\u0027t make anything out. I glance back to my car and to the space in front of us where Lake\u0027s car should be. My eyes follow the broken glass to the median on the right of the highway. I see it. Her car.\n I break out in a run until I reach the car. Gavin is on the passenger side. He\u0027s pulling Eddie out of the car so I run around to help him. Her eyes are closed but she winces when I pull on her arm. She\u0027s okay. I glance inside the car but Lake\u0027s not there. Her driver\u0027s side door is wide open. A sense of relief washes over me when I realize she must be okay if she\u0027s able to walk away. My eyes dart to the backseat and I see Kiersten. As soon as Eddie is lying on the ground, I climb into the backseat and shake Kiersten.\n \"Kiersten,\" I say. She doesn\u0027t respond. She\u0027s got blood on her, but I\u0027m not sure where it\u0027s coming from. \"Kiersten!\" I yell. She still doesn\u0027t respond. I take her wrist and hold it between my fingers. Gavin climbs into the backseat with me and sees me checking her pulse. He looks at me with terror in his eyes.\n \"She\u0027s got a pulse,\" I say. \"Help me get her out.\" He unbuckles her seatbelt as I put my hands underneath her arms and pull her over the front seat. Gavin climbs out first and grabs her legs and helps me pull her out of the car. We lay her next to Eddie. Next to an ever-growing crowd of concerned bystanders. I glance at all of them, but none of them are Lake.\n \"Where the hell did she go?\" I stand up and look around. \"Stay with them,\" I tell Gavin. \"I need to find Lake. She\u0027s probably looking for Kel.\"\n Gavin nods.\n I walk around several vehicles and pass the truck that hit them. What\u0027s left of the truck, anyway. There are several people surrounding it, talking to the driver inside, telling him to wait for help before he gets out. I\u0027m in the middle of the highway, calling her name. Where did she go? I run back to my car and Kel and Caulder are both still inside.\n \"Is she okay?\" Kel asks. \"Is Layken okay?\" He\u0027s crying.\n \"Yeah, I think so. She walked away…I just can\u0027t find her. You guys stay here, I\u0027ll be right back.\"\n I finally hear sirens as I\u0027m making my way back to Lake\u0027s car. When the emergency vehicles come closer, their flashing lights illuminate all the chaos…almost emphasizing it. I look at Gavin. He\u0027s hovering over Kiersten checking her pulse again. The sound of the sirens fade as I watch everyone around me move in slow motion.\n All I can hear is the sound of my own breath.\n An ambulance pulls up beside me and the lights slowly make their way in a circle…as if their job as lights is to display the perimeter of the damage. I follow along with my eyes as one of the red lights slowly illuminates across my car, then the car next to mine, then over the top of Lake\u0027s car, then on top of the truck that hit them, then across Lake lying in the snow. Lake! As soon as the red light circles further, it\u0027s dark and I don\u0027t see her anymore. I run.\n I try to scream her name, but nothing comes out. There are people in my way, but I just shove past them. I keep running and running, but it feels like the distance between us keeps getting further and further away.\n \"Will!\" I hear Gavin yell. He\u0027s off the ground and running after me.\n When I finally reach her, she\u0027s just lying there in the snow with her eyes closed. There\u0027s blood on her head. So much blood. I tear off my jacket and throw it in the snow and remove my shirt. I begin wiping the blood off of her face with it, trying desperately to find her injuries.\n \"Lake! No, no, no. Lake, no.\" I touch her face with my hand, trying to gain some sort of reaction out of her. It’s cold. She\u0027s so cold. As soon as I put my hands under her shoulders to pull her into my lap, someone pulls me back. Paramedics swarm her as I\u0027m being pulled away from her. I can\u0027t see her anymore. I can\u0027t see her.\n \"Will!\" Gavin yells. He\u0027s in my face. He\u0027s shaking me. \"Will! We need to get to the hospital. They\u0027ll take her there. We need to go.\"\n He\u0027s trying to push me away from her. I can\u0027t speak, so I shake my head and push him out of my way. I start to run back to them. Back to her. He pulls me back again. \"Will, don\u0027t! Let them help her.\"\n I turn around and shove him, then run back to her. They\u0027re moving her onto a gurney when I skid to a stop in the snow right next to her. \"Lake!\"\n One of the paramedics pushes me back as the others lift her up and carry her to the ambulance. \"I need in there!\" I yell. \"Let me in there!\" The paramedic won\u0027t let me by as they shut the doors and tap on the glass. The ambulance pulls away. As soon as its lights fade into the distance, I fall to my knees.\n I can\u0027t breathe.\n I can\u0027t breathe.\n I still can\u0027t breathe.\n Thursday, January 26th, 2012.\n Chapter Thirteen\n When I open my eyes, I immediately have to close them again. It\u0027s so bright. I\u0027m shaking. My whole body is shaking. Actually, it\u0027s not my body that\u0027s shaking at all. It\u0027s whatever I\u0027m lying on that\u0027s shaking.\n \"Will? Are you okay?\"\n I hear Caulder\u0027s voice. I open my eyes and see him sitting next to me. We\u0027re in an ambulance. He\u0027s crying. I try to sit up to hug him, but someone pushes me back down.\n \"Be still, Sir. You\u0027ve got a pretty bad gash I\u0027m working on here.\"\n I look at the person talking to me. It\u0027s the paramedic that was holding me back. \"Is she okay?\" I feel myself succumb to the panic again. \"Where is she? Is she okay?\"\n He puts his hand on my shoulder to hold me still and places gauze over my eye. \"I wish I knew something…but I don\u0027t. I’m sorry. I just know I need to get this injury of yours closed. We\u0027ll get more information when we get there.\"\n I look around the ambulance but I don\u0027t see Kel. \"Where\u0027s Kel?\"\n \"They put him and Gavin in the other ambulance to check on them. They said we would see them at the hospital,\" Caulder says.\n I lay my head back, close my eyes and pray.\n As soon as the ambulance doors open and they pull me out, I jump off the gurney.\n \"Sir, get back here! You need stitches!\"\n I keep running. I glance back to make sure Caulder is following me. He is, so I keep running. When I get inside, Gavin and Kel are standing at the nurses\u0027 station. \"Kel!\" I yell. Kel runs up to me and hugs me. I pick him up and he wraps his arms around my neck. \"Where are they?\" I say to Gavin. \"Where\u0027d they take them?\"\n \"I can\u0027t find anyone,\" Gavin says. He looks as panicked as I do. He sees a nurse round the corner and he runs up to her. \"We\u0027re looking for three girls that were just brought here?”\n She glances at all four of us, then walks around the desk to her computer. \"Are you family?\"\n Gavin looks at me, then back at her. \"Yes,\" he lies.\n She eyes Gavin and picks up the phone. \"The family is here,\" she says. She listens. \"Yes, sir.\"\n She hangs up the phone and stands up. \"Follow me,\" she says. She leads us around the corner and into a room. \"The Dr. will be with you as soon as possible.\" She turns and walks away.\n I set Kel down in a chair. Caulder sits next to him. Gavin takes his jacket off and hands it to me. I look down and realize for the first time since I took it off, that I\u0027m not even wearing a shirt. I pull the jacket on. Gavin and I pace the room. Several minutes pass and I can\u0027t take it anymore.\n \"I\u0027ve got to find her,\" I say. I start to walk out of the room and Gavin pulls me back. \"Just give it a minute, Will. If they try to find you, you won\u0027t be here. Just give it a minute.\"\n I begin to pace again. Every now and then I lean down and hug Kel, who\u0027s still crying. He hasn’t said anything. Not a single word.\n She has to be okay. She has to.\n I glance across the hall and see a restroom. I go inside and as soon as I shut the door behind me, I immediately get sick. I lean over the toilet as I vomit. When I think I\u0027m finished, I wash my hands in the sink and rinse my mouth out. I grip the edges of the sink and take a deep breath, trying to calm down. I need to calm down for Kel. He doesn\u0027t need to see me like this.\n When I look in the mirror, I don\u0027t even recognize myself. There\u0027s dried blood all over the side of my face. The bandage the paramedic placed on top of my eye is already saturated again. I grab a napkin and try to wipe some of the blood off. As I\u0027m wiping, I find myself wishing I had some of Sherry\u0027s medicine.\n Sherry. \"Sherry!\" I yell. I throw open the bathroom door. \"Gavin! We have to call Sherry! Where\u0027s your phone?\"\n Gavin pats his pockets. \"I think it\u0027s in my jacket,\" he says. \"I need to call Joel.\"\n I reach into his jacket and pull out his phone. \"Shit! I don\u0027t know her number, it\u0027s in my phone.\"\n \"I know her number. Hand it to me, I\u0027ll dial it,\" Kel says. He wipes his eyes and reaches out for the phone, so I hand it to him. When he punches in the numbers and hands me the phone back, I suddenly feel sick again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/point-of-retreat-slammed-2/page-25.html","bookId":2780,"book":{"id":2780,"title":"Point of Retreat (Slammed #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Point of Retreat (Slammed #2) \n Hardships and heartache brought them together… now it will tear them apart. \n Layken and Will have proved their love can get them through anything; until someone from Will’s past re-emerges, leaving Layken questioning the very foundation on which their relationship was built.
