I’ll write something like: ‘When you eat this chocolate soufflé, you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven . . . and speaking of dying, my friend Cordie . . .’” “How do you come up with new recipes, Sophie?” Cordie asked. “We know you can’t cook.” “That’s not true. I’m getting better. But I have a secret weapon.” Regan guessed. “Your husband.” “Yes,” she said. “He loves to cook, and he’s really good.” Cordie was feeling so serene she sat back against the soft cushions of the sofa with her feet propped up and dozed off while her friends chatted around her. She woke up when Sophie nudged her. “Do you?” “Do I what?” Cordie asked, startled from her slumber. “Do you think Regan’s brothers will ever get married?” She thought about it for a minute and said, “Spencer will. Of the three, he’s the most compassionate. Walker . . . maybe. He’s vulnerable now, and I think it would be difficult for him to trust anyone outside his family.” “And Aiden?” She shrugged. “I don’t know about him.” She did know, though. He was too driven to settle down . . . too busy. “I don’t think he’ll marry,” Sophie surmised. “But then, I didn’t think I’d ever get married, and look what happened.” Regan smiled. “Jack happened,” she said. Sophie blew on her fingernails and tapped one to make sure it was dry. “How are you getting along with Aiden?” she asked Cordie. “Is it weird sharing a suite with him?” “Look how big this place is,” Regan said, throwing her arms wide. “There’s plenty of room for both of them.” “We get along just fine. He’s rarely here, and I hardly notice him when he is,” Cordie asserted, knowing full well that wasn’t true. Now she was lying to her friends, and the more questions they asked about Aiden, the more lies she would tell. Not wanting to continue the conversation, she jumped up and reached for the hotel phone. “Let’s order room service. I’m starving.” “Great idea,” Regan said. “I’m suddenly in the mood for a chocolate soufflé.” TWENTY-FOUR Cordie decided she was going to have to give up sex. To be more specific, sex with Aiden. Not that being specific mattered. Before Aiden, she hadn’t had sex with any man in such a long time she thought there must be something wrong with her. Had she turned into a female eunuch? Or had her hormones taken a sabbatical? Saying no to the sexiest man alive . . . how hard could that be? She’d given up sugar and caffeine for Lent last year, and she’d gotten through the forty days without cheating. Granted, the first week had been rough. She’d had a horrid headache, and the boys at school ran the other way when they saw her coming, but she’d gotten past it. This wasn’t at all the same. She’d already given up on her “I’m over him” mantra. How could she possibly get over the man while she was living with him? She could walk away from him, though. She could go into her bedroom and shut the door. Oh, who was she kidding? Just thinking about the way he touched her made her breathless. The erotic words he whispered in her ear were so hot. She had it bad, all right, and she didn’t know what in the world she could do about it. He hadn’t given her any promises, and she didn’t have any expectations of a future together. For him it had just been raw sex, and she was okay with that. It was closing in on midnight when she gave up trying to sleep. She’d been tossing and turning so many times she felt as though she were on a trampoline. It was all the caffeine she’d had today, she decided. That was the reason she couldn’t doze off. It had nothing to do with the fact that Aiden wasn’t home yet. Home? She was calling the suite home now? She went into the living room and turned on the television. She had a game plan. She would channel surf until she found something boring, like golf or fishing, and that would make her sleepy. Who knew learning how to gut a walleye could be interesting? The next program did the trick, though. Fishing with Larry was exactly what Cordie needed. Everyone on the show whispered so they wouldn’t disturb the fish. It was incredibly boring. She drifted off but woke up sometime in the middle of the night. She was wrapped in Aiden’s strong arms and sleeping in his bed. He smelled so good, and his body was hard and warm, and oh, did she want him. All she had to do was kiss the side of his neck, just under his ear, and whisper his name. He did the rest. He was gentle with her, taking care to protect her injured arm, yet he was forceful, pushing her to the brink and then pulling back until she was writhing in his arms and begging. He was more out of control this time, and when he cl**axed, she was there with him. Cordie slept soundly in his arms all night long, and when she awoke, Aiden had already left the suite . . . most likely to go down to his office, she supposed. She went into her bedroom, put on her robe, and padded to the bathroom to brush her teeth. Nurse Patty knocked on her door a minute later, and Cordie was thankful the woman hadn’t found her in Aiden’s bed. “Mr. Madison will be back here to pick you up at twelve thirty,” Patty announced. “He said to tell you that he and two FBI agents will be taking you to the doctor today.” “Jack and Alec are good friends. You’ve met them.” “Yes, I have, and I’m sure they’ll watch out for you. They won’t let anyone push you into traffic today. I don’t think you really need them, though, not with Mr. Madison around. I know he doesn’t carry a gun, but he could take on anyone who tried to harm you. He plays sports, you know.” She added with a nod, “He’s quite competitive and strong.” Cordie knew how strong he was. She’d caressed and kissed nearly every inch of his magnificent body. She had trailed her fingertips across his chest and shoulders and down his upper arms. She had felt the heat from his muscles, the sinewy strength just below the surface. Thinking about him made her pulse race. She realized she was holding her breath and slowly let it out. Patty stared at her with a quizzical expression. “What were you thinking about just now? You had the sweetest look in your eyes.” Cordie wasn’t about to tell her the truth. “I was thinking that normally I can take care of myself. Aiden taught Regan and Sophie and me a few tricks.” Patty helped her put the plastic sleeve over her cast so it wouldn’t get wet while she showered; then she gathered the soap and shampoo and towels and placed them within easy reach, keeping up a constant chatter as she worked. An hour later Cordie was dressed and ready for the day. She wore a simple white blouse and a blue-and-white skirt with ballet flats. Patty helped her brush her hair and then left to tend to Walker. There was still some time left before Cordie had to leave for her doctor’s appointment, so she set up her laptop on the table. While she ate a bowl of yogurt with fruit and granola, she worked on answering e-mails. There were several from her former students, and she replied to them first. She might no longer be their teacher, but she didn’t want to lose touch. Aiden came into the suite ten minutes early. He gave her the once-over and asked, “Are you ready?” She shut down her computer, picked up her purse, and walked to the door. “What about Alec and Jack?” “They’re waiting in the lobby.” He turned her toward him and adjusted her sling. “You stay close to me,” he ordered. His hand was on the doorknob, but he stood there, waiting. She assumed he wanted her agreement. “Yes, I will.” Before she could guess what he was going to do, he leaned down and kissed her. It was a long, thoroughly hot kiss, and when he pulled back, she sagged against him. “Let’s go,” he said in his brisk, abrupt voice. He obviously wasn’t having quite the reaction she was. She straightened away from him and walked by his side around the corner to the elevator. The guard was holding the doors open. When they emerged in the lobby, she spotted Alec and Jack standing in front of the hotel’s tall revolving doors. She moved closer to Aiden, trying to look at every face as they crossed the lobby. Was someone waiting to grab her? Unless he wore a sign, she wouldn’t be able to tell if anyone was there to make trouble. She didn’t know what to look for. Jack drove them, and Aiden sat next to Cordie in the backseat. He put his hand on top of hers and asked, “Are you nervous?” “Why? Do you think the doctor will give me a shot?” It took a couple of seconds for him to realize she was teasing. “That’s not funny, Cordelia. I was asking if you were nervous being outside. This is serious . . .” He was getting angry, and she could feel the tension in him. “I’m not nervous, because I’m in good hands. You did say you wouldn’t let anything happen to me, and I believe you.” “All right, then.” He was appeased. Alec turned toward them, noticed Aiden was holding her hand, but didn’t comment of course. He said, “Cordie, I talked to Liam last night, and he wants you to get a DNA test as soon as possible.” “Did he explain why?” Aiden asked. “Does he have a plan in mind?” “He’s working on it.” “The only reason for a DNA test is to legally prove I’m related to that witch. What’s he going to do with it? I don’t want or need proof,” Cordie protested. “But you’ll get the test anyway, won’t you?” Alec asked. “I don’t think I want to—” “It will be quick and easy,” Jack told her. “Over before you know it,” Alec added. “In other words, I’m getting the test, aren’t I?” “That’s my girl,” Alec said. “I never really had a choice, did I?” Alec told her the truth, but he said it with a grin. “No.” Cordie stared out the window. It was a beautiful sunny day and as hot as the devil, which she loved. She tried to sit back and calmly watch the passing scenes on the street, but she couldn’t. There were too many thoughts racing through her mind that needed to be sorted out. She was about to have a DNA test. What did Liam plan to do with it? What was the connection to the man who tried to kill her? Was he still out there, and would he try again? She could feel her stomach tightening, and she leaned into Aiden’s side. Just being close to his strength and his confidence was comforting. He was getting one phone call after another, and usually he would be on his phone nonstop doing business, but today he let the calls go to voice mail. The texts were also piling up, but he ignored those as well. It suddenly occurred to her that she had assumed he would go with her to the doctor. Now, why had she done that? He had to know she was safe with Jack and Alec, yet he’d either canceled or rescheduled his appointments to go with her. It was so thoughtful of him, so caring. Her mood lightened, and she suddenly wanted to kiss him. Unfortunately, the feeling didn’t last. Aiden ruined it when he said, “It won’t be long before this will all be over, and we can get on with our lives.” Had they been alone, she would have told him he could get on with his damn life right this minute. She wasn’t his responsibility or his obligation. They weren’t alone, though, and she knew Alec and Jack were listening to the conversation. She chose a more subtle response. She moved away from him and turned to look out the window again. They were in and out of the specialist’s office in record time. The waiting room was packed, but as soon as the receptionist saw two armed men with badges, she quickly ushered all of them into an exam room. Cordie felt ridiculous sitting on the exam table with three big men surrounding her. “I’m safe here,” she told them. “Why don’t you all go sit in the waiting room.” “I’m not going out there,” Jack said. “I might catch something.” Alec nodded in agreement. Cordie laughed. “Broken bones aren’t contagious.” Alec looked skeptical, but he relented. “We’ll be right outside the door.” Jack followed him, but from Aiden’s stance it was apparent he wasn’t going anywhere. He stood with his back to the wall and his arms folded across his chest. He stayed with her while the doctor, who didn’t have a humble bone in his body, looked at his handiwork and praised himself for the fine job he’d done. He ordered an X-ray, was pleased with the film, and told her she would be in the cast another four weeks. Next came the DNA test, which was quick and easy. They were on their way back to the hotel in a matter of minutes. Jack pulled up in the circle drive, parked in front of the hotel steps, and motioned to the guard who was waiting just inside the doors. Alec got out of the passenger seat and opened the door for Cordie. “We’re going to check in with security before we take off,” he said. He was about to say something else, but his cell phone rang. “Sorry, I’ve got to take this,” he said. Aiden wouldn’t let Cordie stand there any longer. He took hold of her arm and pulled her along. Once inside the doors, he motioned to the security guard, and the two men flanked her sides as they crossed the lobby. Cordie appreciated the protection, but she was beginning to feel like some paparazzi target being shuffled away from the crowd. The hotel guests stepped aside as the men rushed her through the lobby. She did her best not to look conspicuous, but it was difficult. Even though she was walking at a fast clip, she spotted Patty near the bellman desk talking to a man holding a huge vase of calla lilies, and she wondered which one of Walker’s admirers had sent the impressive get-well surprise. The arrangement was spectacular, so large the deliveryman had to hold it with both his arms around the vase. She couldn’t see his face, but she could see Patty’s clearly. It was flushed. Was she flirting? It seemed so. The nurse was so wrapped up in keeping the man’s attention, she didn’t notice Cordie waving to her. Cordie stepped into the penthouse elevator, and as the doors were closing, she heard the man’s booming laughter and smiled in reaction. So he was flirting, too. Ah, the power of love. Did most men and women want to fall in love? she wondered. Opening their hearts and becoming vulnerable made them either very brave or stupidly naive, and at the moment she believed she belonged in the stupidly naive category. Loving Aiden was god-awful painful, and she had had enough.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fast-track-buchanan-renard-12/page-27.html","bookId":1825,"book":{"id":1825,"title":"Fast Track (Buchanan-Renard #12)","description":"Storyline: A corrupt congressman, a mother’s secrets, and a sizzling romance ignite passion and suspense in the new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
