We’ve agreed to terms and we’re here to get the papers signed. Spencer has the timetable. You should talk to him.” He glanced to his left, where his brother had been standing.\n “He already went up in the elevator,” Kalie explained.\n Aiden laughed. Spencer hated doing interviews almost as much as Aiden did. He would have taken off if he’d had the chance and left Spencer to field questions, but he wasn’t fast enough this time.\n “Now, if you’ll excuse me . . .”\n “Just one more question, please. How did you find out about Rock Point? This is such a remote area,” she explained.\n “Mayor Green,” he answered. “She waged a relentless campaign to get Spencer to come look.”\n Kalie thanked him, motioned to the cameraman to stop filming, and then followed Aiden to the elevator. “Will you be staying in town tonight?” she asked.\n His answer was abrupt. “No.”\n “I could take you out for a drink . . .” Her voice was wistful.\n He smiled to soften the rejection, then said, “No, thank you.” The elevator doors closed before she could ask another question.\n The meeting was set for four o’clock. They were fifteen minutes early—Aiden couldn’t abide being late for anything—but apparently the Chamberses had a more relaxed notion of meeting schedules.\n Spencer grinned when he saw his brother. “What took you so long?”\n The question didn’t merit an answer. Aiden went to the two-story window and looked out at the landscape. It wasn’t a pretty day. The sky was gray, but darker clouds were moving in, and from the way the trees were swaying, he knew the wind was up.\n The receptionist, a thirty-year-old single woman, couldn’t stop staring at the brothers. They were handsome men, both tall and muscular through the shoulders, impressively lean and fit, with dark hair and patrician features. They wore business suits, designer label, she surmised. Aiden in his dark suit with pale blue shirt and striped tie, and Spencer in a pinstriped suit with a crisp white shirt and red tie. Oh my, were they sexy. She heard herself sigh and was mortified. But they were just so . . . fine.\n “Is something wrong?” Spencer asked when she continued to stare at them.\n “No, no,” she stammered. “I was just noticing what nice suits you’re wearing, and I was thinking that both of you look like you belong on Wall Street.”\n Spencer smiled. “These days that isn’t a compliment.”\n She laughed. “I guess it isn’t. I’m sorry you’re having to wait. Mr. Chambers should be out any minute now. I’ve buzzed him three times already.”\n At twenty minutes after four the double doors suddenly flew open, and Lester came rushing out to greet them. Aiden supposed he was trying to give the impression that he was a very busy man. He waved his hands while he apologized for keeping them waiting, explaining that he was on an urgent call.\n “Very urgent,” he reiterated as he shook their hands. He ushered them into his office and closed the door. “You boys are getting quite a bargain. I feel like you’re stealing Rock Point from me and my cousin. I really do.”\n Boys? Spencer glanced at Aiden, who didn’t show any reaction to Lester’s condescension.\n “The offer you accepted was more than fair,” Aiden told him in a firm, no-nonsense tone of voice.\n “Where is your cousin?” Spencer asked.\n As if on cue, the doors opened and Congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers strolled inside. He didn’t look anything like his cousin. Lester was short, not quite five-two, with a noticeable paunch and a bald spot on the top of his head. Mitchell had a full head of silver-tipped hair, compliments of his stylist. He was a trim six feet, and his face seemed to be cast in a perpetual smile.\n “I’m sorry I’m late,” Mitchell began. “I came up the back steps, but I still got caught and asked for autographs. I couldn’t say no.” Almost as an afterthought he added, “I’m a man of the people.”\n If he was out to impress Aiden and Spencer, he was failing.\n “Let me make the introductions,” Lester insisted. “I’d like you to meet my cousin, the very important congressman Mitchell Ray Chambers.”\n Spencer grinned. He’d just won the bet. Very important indeed.\n Lester went to his desk and sat. “I can’t tell you how long it’s been since Mitchell has been home. At least a year now.”\n Mitchell frowned. “Nonsense. I represent the good people of Fallsborough. I fly back and forth from Washington all the time.”\n Lester scoffed. “No, you don’t, and the good people of Fallsborough have noticed.”\n “This isn’t the time for complaints,” Mitchell snapped. Turning back to Aiden and Spencer, his smile still plastered on his face, he said, “Shall we sit at the conference table? I’m here to negotiate, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get down to business.”\n “Negotiate what?” Lester wanted to know.\n “The sale of Rock Point, of course.” Crossing the office, he turned one of the swivel chairs from the long conference table and sat down. He swung his right leg over his left and rested his ankle on his knee, then leaned back and waited.\n Spencer and Aiden stayed where they were. Since Spencer had talked to both cousins and their attorney multiple times, hammering out all the details, he was the one who had heard both Lester and Mitchell agree to the final price for the land.\n “There isn’t going to be any negotiation today,” Spencer said. “You agreed to the price. It’s time to sign the final offer.”\n “I didn’t agree to anything.” Mitchell smiled while he told the lie.\n A true politician, Aiden thought.\n “We both agreed,” Lester reminded him.\n “No, we didn’t,” Mitchell snapped. He shot his cousin a glare before the smile was back in place.\n Lester didn’t know when to be quiet. “Our attorney looked over the papers. Everything’s in order. Let’s just sign them.”\n “I didn’t look the papers over,” Mitchell countered.\n “Yes, you did. They were sent to you, and you told me you got them.”\n “Will you keep your mouth . . .” Mitchell took a breath and turned to Spencer. “Have your attorneys had time to read the documents?”\n “My brother and I are both attorneys,” Spencer explained. He was trying to keep his anger under control, but the congressman was making that a real challenge.\n “I agreed to an opening bid,” Mitchell announced.\n Aiden watched Spencer. He was letting him take the lead and decide the next move. His brother opened his briefcase and put the folder with the contract inside. “What would you consider a fair price, Congressman?”\n “At least three times what you offered,” he answered with certainty. He sensed a victory and couldn’t have been more pleased. “Come on, now. Sit down and let’s work out this deal.”\n “No, that isn’t going to happen. You gave your word.” Spencer’s voice wasn’t pleasant now, but hard, angry.\n Mitchell shrugged. “I didn’t sign anything. Keep that in mind.”\n Beads of sweat were beginning to form on Lester’s forehead. He turned to Spencer. “Let’s talk this through. I know how much you want Rock Point. You said yourself it had great potential. You must have walked over that ground a dozen times.”\n Aiden had heard enough. “We don’t work with people whose word is meaningless. We’re through here.”\n Lester’s mouth dropped open. “But we . . . we had a solid offer . . . we . . .”\n Mitchell didn’t say a word while his cousin sputtered his indignation. He simply watched the Madison brothers leave Lester’s office. Then he strolled over to the bar and poured himself a drink.\n “It was a great offer,” Lester muttered. “What have you done?”\n “Don’t worry,” Mitchell said, his voice smug. “They’ll be back.”\n Lester shook his head. “I’m not so sure.”\n “I’ll bet they reach the lobby and turn around. Spencer Madison wants Rock Point, and I’m going to make him pay a premium for it. He’ll talk his brother into negotiating. Just you wait and see.”\n “They seemed angry that you broke your word.”\n Mitchell shrugged. “They’ll get over it. Saying one thing and doing another . . . that’s all part of negotiating. As long as you don’t sign anything and you’re not being recorded . . .”\n “Do you hear yourself? A man’s word—”\n “Can it, Lester. Just let it go. I know what I’m doing.”\n Mitchell kept his eye on the elevators, waiting for the doors to open and prove him right. The Madisons were probably on their way back up.\n Aiden and Spencer had no intention of returning to Chambers’s office. As soon as they reached the lobby they were surrounded by a crowd of men and women holding balloons and cheering. The cameraman was there again, standing behind Kalie, the Channel Seven reporter, who stepped forward with a wide smile of greeting. She held the microphone up to Aiden and said, “And here are the new owners of Rock . . .” She stopped when Aiden shook his head. “You didn’t purchase the land just yet?”\n “No,” he answered. He looked directly into the camera as he explained. “Congressman Mitchell Chambers changed his mind. He wanted more money than we originally agreed on. We won’t be buying Rock Point.”\n “It’s disappointing,” Spencer interjected. “But we’re going to move on to another property.”\n Kalie looked stunned. “Wait,” she pleaded as Aiden walked past her. “Are you saying Congressman Mitchell Chambers stopped the sale?”\n “Yes, that’s what I’m saying,” Aiden answered.\n “Then the Hamilton Hotel won’t be built here?”\n “No.” His tone was emphatic.\n Aiden walked out the door and didn’t look back. Spencer followed. The plan was to fly to San Francisco and stay at the Hamilton there while Spencer checked on the remodel he’d begun three months ago, but the plan changed when they received a text from their sister, Regan.\n Aiden retrieved his phone from his pocket and looked at the screen.\n “Oh no,” he said.\n “What’s wrong?” Spencer asked.\n “Cordelia’s dad died. Heart attack.”\n Shocked by the news, Spencer didn’t speak for a few seconds. The Madison family had known Cordie and her father for almost twenty years, and Mr. Kane had always been so strong and vigorous.\n “Andrew Kane was a good man,” he remarked.\n “Yes, he was,” Aiden agreed. “Cordelia must be devastated.”\n He immediately called Regan to find out when the funeral was scheduled. His sister was crying. “Cordie’s all alone now. Are you coming home? She’ll want you and Spencer there.”\n “Of course we’ll be there. We’re on our way home now.”\n Spencer opened the car door, then paused to look up at the building they’d just left. All that time wasted, he thought. The engineering reports, the back-and-forth negotiating with two of the most unpleasant men he’d ever encountered—all for nothing.\n “Let’s go,” Aiden called out impatiently.\n Lester Chambers stood at the window and watched the SUV pull onto the main road and drive away. “They’re on their way to the airstrip,” he said. “And you were so sure they would come right back up here.”\n Mitchell went to the bar to freshen his drink. He dropped an ice cube into his glass, causing the whiskey to splash all over his hand. He grabbed a napkin to mop up the mess, then took a sip of his drink.\n “They’re not coming back.” Lester continued to stare out the window until the SUV vanished. There was panic in his voice. “It was a damn good offer.”\n “Stop whining. I know what I’m doing. I know how people think,” he boasted. “It’s why I make such a great congressman. Believe me. The Madisons will be back. Maybe not today, but soon. I’ll give them a week to come begging.”\n Lester’s receptionist rushed into the office. “Sir, one of the secretaries . . . Jenny just mentioned that Channel Seven was in the lobby.”\n Mitchell let out a loud, long-suffering sigh. “They’re here for me. I’ll let them wait a little longer before I go down and do the interview.”\n “No, Jenny said the channel’s crew just left but that we should all watch the five-o’clock news.”\n “They probably got tired of waiting for you,” Lester told his cousin.\n Mitchell agreed. “I can’t be everywhere all the time,” he excused himself. He reached for the remote on the desk and turned the television on. It wasn’t quite five yet, so Mitchell put the sound on mute and sat on the sofa.\n “Did you know Mayor Green is running against you?” Lester asked.\n Mitchell snorted. “Of course I knew. She’s wasting her time and money. She doesn’t stand a chance. I’ll bet I get ninety percent of the vote.”\n “The primary is not that far away,” Lester reminded him.\n No one was going to take his job away. Mitchell loved being a congressman. He loved the power, the position it garnered, and the respect, though admittedly the public didn’t think much of Congress these days, probably because they knew so many of them were corrupt or just inept. There was talk of term limits. Mitchell had promised to push for those if elected, but once he was in office he changed his mind. Besides, no one in Congress was ever going to vote for that, and Mitchell planned to stay in office until he was well into his eighties. The governor had handpicked him for the job, and as long as Mitchell played ball and voted the way the governor wanted, he would remain a congressman.\n “You know it was Mayor Green who got Spencer Madison interested in Rock Point,” Lester commented.\n “So she says.”\n “Oh, there she is. Turn the sound on. I want to hear what our mayor has to say.”\n The segment lasted a good ten minutes without a commercial break, which was unheard of. The last footage Kalie showed was Aiden Madison explaining why they wouldn’t be building a Hamilton Hotel on Rock Point. He placed the blame squarely on Congressman Chambers’s shoulders. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fast-track-buchanan-renard-12/page-4.html","bookId":1825,"book":{"id":1825,"title":"Fast Track (Buchanan-Renard #12)","description":"Storyline: \n A corrupt congressman, a mother’s secrets, and a sizzling romance ignite passion and suspense in the new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood. \n Cordelia Kane has always been a daddy’s girl—her father raised her alone after her mother died in a car crash when Cordelia was just two years old.
