What do you mean, no?” Did he think she needed his permission? “I can’t let you go.” “Let me?” He could have sworn he saw sparks in her eyes. “I went to Congressman Chambers’s press conference.” Her eyes widened. “You did? What did you do? Was it good?” He laughed. “Yeah, it was.” When he told her what had happened, she was ecstatic. “The mayor had no idea?” “No,” he answered. “The only person who knew I was up to something was the reporter, Kalie. I told her to be ready.” “Do you think the mayor could beat him in the primary?” “I think she has a chance.” “I wish I had been there to see it.” “I wanted you there with me,” he admitted, his tone serious now. “Cordelia, I need to talk to you . . . to tell you . . .” “Yes?” “Come back to the hotel with me. We’ll have privacy there.” She shook her head. “No, Aiden. I’m going to Boston tomorrow, and if I go back to the suite with you, we both know what will happen.” “I can’t let you leave.” He sighed. “Yes, I heard it. I meant I won’t let you leave.” He tried to kiss her, but she turned her head. “We’re in public, for Pete’s sake. Behave yourself.” “You won’t go with me to the hotel where we could have privacy,” he reminded her. “So I guess we’re going to do this here.” “Do what?” she asked suspiciously. “If we were in my suite, first I would kiss you, and then, if I could keep my hands and my mouth off you long enough, I would tell you I love you.” She was so stunned, it took her several seconds to react. “No, you don’t. I was just convenient. Yes, convenient,” she insisted when he looked so incredulous. “What goes on in that mind of yours?” “You don’t love me,” she insisted. “Yes, I do, Cordelia.” His smile was filled with tenderness. “I love you. Do you love me?” “I’m going to Boston.” She was shaken and was having trouble holding a thought. He loved her? When did that happen? “Do you love me?” he asked again. “I’ve bought a town house. I have to move there.” “Cordelia, answer me. Do you love me?” “Yes.” It was a whisper, but he heard her. She poked him in the chest. “That town house was expensive.” “Then I’ll move to Boston with you.” “You can’t move to Boston; your whole life is here,” she said. “Where you go, I go,” he said. “That’s how marriage works.” “Marriage?” “What are you not understanding here? I love you, Cordelia.” He wrapped his strong arms around her and kissed her so passionately her whole body went weak. When the kiss ended, Cordie, still wrapped in Aiden’s embrace, looked around. “The band’s not playing,” she whispered. “I know,” he said, leaning in to kiss her again. She put her fingers on his lips to stop him and nodded her head to the side, motioning for him to look at something. He turned and smiled. Regan and Sophie were standing there staring at them with their mouths open in shock. Aiden laughed. “I’ll let you explain.” “Let me?” EPILOGUE Cordelia and Aiden were married at St. Matthew’s Church three months later. Neither of them wanted to wait, and although there hadn’t been much time to plan, they managed to pull it off without any glitches. Sister Delores was so happy Cordie had decided to come back to St. Matthew’s to teach and so grateful for the scholarship fund Cordie had set up in her father’s name, she actually got teary-eyed during the ceremony. The newlyweds honeymooned in Australia, and Cordie got to see all the wonderful places she had read about. Julian and his daughter couldn’t ruin her love for the country, but she avoided Sydney until it was time to meet the board and sign the papers. She didn’t want the stock, yet according to the will she couldn’t give it up. “What are we going to do with it?” she asked Aiden. “We’ll figure out something,” he assured her. When they reached Sydney, they stayed in their suite at the Hamilton, of course. According to Liam, the scandal of the year was finally dying down. He went with them to the company headquarters to meet the board. He wore his weapon on his hip, but Cordie didn’t see a badge. “Do you expect trouble?” she asked. She walked between Aiden and Liam up the steps to the entrance of the office building. “Just a precaution,” he explained. The board members were waiting for her. There were eleven at the long table, all men, and all of them trying to mask their unease. The twelfth board member, Craig Rayburn, was noticeably absent, and Cordie was thankful she didn’t have to be in the same room with him. The men stood when she entered. “Miss Kane is here,” the man at the head of the table said. “It’s Dr. Madison.” Aiden made the correction. “Doctor?” “Yes.” There was a hard edge to Aiden’s voice, and Cordie presumed he was telling them to respect her. Each board member introduced himself. She didn’t shake hands with any of them. Aiden handed her a pen. She appreciated that her husband had gone to law school, because only after he had read over the documents did he allow her to sign. Liam, acting like a bodyguard, stood watch behind her. “Do you plan to be active . . . with your stock? Will you be voting?” the man in the chairman’s chair asked. “Perhaps,” she answered. Thirty long minutes later, Liam was driving them back to the hotel, and Aiden was trying to talk him into having dinner with them as a thank-you for all his help. “I appreciate the offer,” Liam said, “but I have to be in Melbourne tonight. There’s a . . . situation I have to clean up.” “Liam, may I ask you a question?” Cordie asked. He looked at her in the rearview mirror. “Sure you can.” “Who do you work for?” Grinning, he said, “Depends on the day of the week.” “Okay, today who do you work for?” “The government.” “Which government?” “That’s a good question. If you don’t mind, I’m going to drop you off at the hotel and be on my way. I have a plane waiting for me,” he said, effectively putting an end to the topic of his employment. Giving up, she turned to Aiden. “What did you think of the board?” “I haven’t made a judgment yet. Not enough information.” “I don’t think they liked me.” “What makes you think so?” Liam asked. “I can tell when I’m being played,” she said with authority. Liam thought that was quite funny. “You can tell, huh?” “Yes, I can. I’m used to people trying to con me. I teach high school boys.” “Then you knew all those delays on the floors of your Boston town house didn’t really happen. Alec was scheming up one excuse after another to keep you in Chicago . . . but you figured that out, right?” “He what? Why would he want to keep me in Chicago?” “According to him, you two were clueless. Those were his words, not mine. He thought Aiden needed time to figure it all out, and so did you.” She was astounded. She had been played. “Then the floors . . .” “They were finished the first week.” That devil. “I’m going to be having a little chat with him when we get home.” She was still thinking about Alec’s tricks when Liam pulled up in front of the hotel and got out to say good-bye. “It’s been a pleasure,” he said, shaking Aiden’s hand. When he turned to Cordie, she hugged him and said, “Thank you so much for everything you’ve done.” “Anytime,” he said. He winked at her and got back in the car. As he was driving off, Aiden took Cordie’s hand. “I could use a drink. How about you?” “That sounds lovely,” she replied. They entered the lobby and were heading to the bar when Aiden asked, “Do you see her? Simone is here.” Cordie looked at the far end of the lobby and spotted Simone sitting stiffly in a wingback chair near the bank of elevators. “What does she want?” she asked. “You don’t have to talk to her, Cordelia.” “I don’t think she’ll go away. Let’s get it over with.” They continued into the bar, conscious that Simone was watching. When she stood and followed them, Cordie felt as though she was heading for a showdown at the O.K. Corral. Taking a seat at one of the tables, she waited. Simone didn’t try to hide her anger. There was a round table between them, and for a second Cordie thought the woman might lunge at her. Simone’s voice shook. “Do you know what you’ve done to me? To my family?” “I don’t believe I’m the one who did anything. It was your father who tried to have me killed. He belongs in prison, and I’m not so sure you don’t belong there, too, but unfortunately, it’s not a crime to be a coldhearted bitch.” Simone couldn’t restrain herself. Her hand flew at Cordie, but Aiden grabbed her wrist. “Why did you come here?” Cordie asked. “I wanted you to know the terrible, terrible thing you’ve done to me. You’ve destroyed me and my family.” “How have I done that?” she asked quietly. “We can’t hold our heads up, thanks to you. The shame . . . the humiliation is too much to bear. I’ve been asked to resign from every board, every charity. I’m being shunned and cut out of every social function in the city. Your hate did that to me.” “I don’t hate you. I feel sorry for you. The scandal will fade, and in time it might even be forgotten. I promise, you’ll never have to worry about seeing me in the future. And you can forget all about me once again.” Cordie’s promise seemed to calm Simone. She nodded and, without another word, walked out of the bar. Leaning into Aiden, Cordie watched her leave. “She was very young when she had me.” “Is that an excuse for her behavior?” “Maybe,” she said. “I do feel sorry for her. She made me realize how very lucky I am. I was raised by a loving father, and I doubt Simone got much affection from her father. Julian was more interested in keeping her in line.” She put her arms around Aiden’s neck. “You’re going to be a wonderful father.” “You think?” “I know.” She kissed him and whispered in his ear, “Shall we go upstairs and get started?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fast-track-buchanan-renard-12/page-34.html","bookId":1825,"book":{"id":1825,"title":"Fast Track (Buchanan-Renard #12)","description":"Storyline: A corrupt congressman, a mother’s secrets, and a sizzling romance ignite passion and suspense in the new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood.
