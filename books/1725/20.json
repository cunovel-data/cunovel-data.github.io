I\u0027d never have recognized either of you. How are you? How are you?\" \"As well as we could wish. Our letter reached you, I see,\" said Elk. \"Of course. Tell me, what do you think of it all?\" They were walking back together, toward Junz\u0027s offices. Valona said sadly, \"We visited our old town this morning. The fields are so empty.\" Her clothing was now that of a woman of the Empire, rather than that of a peasant of Florina. \"Yes, it must be dreary for a person who has lived here. It grows dreary even for me, but I will stay as long as I can. The radiation recordings of Florina\u0027s sun are of tremendous theoretical interest.\" \"So much evacuation in less than a year! It speaks for excellent organization.\" \"We\u0027re doing our best, Elk. Oh, I think I should be calling you by your real name.\" \"Please don\u0027t. I\u0027ll never be used to it. I\u0027m Elk. That\u0027s still the only name I remember.\" Junz said, \"Have you decided whether you\u0027re going to return to Spatio-analysis?\" Rik shook his head. \"I\u0027ve decided, but the decision is, no. I\u0027ll never remember enough. That part\u0027s gone forever. It doesn\u0027t bother me, though. I\u0027ll be returning to Earth... By the way, I rather hoped I\u0027d see the Townman.\" \"I think not. He decided to go off today. I think he\u0027d rather not see you. He feels guilty, I think. You have no grudge against him?\" Rik said, \"No. He meant well, and he changed my life in many ways for the better. For one thing, I met Lana.\" His arm went about her shoulder. Valona looked at him and smiled. \"Besides,\" Elk went on, \"he cured me of something. I\u0027ve found out why I was a Spatio-analyst. I know why nearly a third of all Spatio-analysts are recruited from the one planet, Earth. Anyone living on a radioactive world is bound to grow up in fear and insecurity. A misstep can mean death and our planet\u0027s own surface is the greatest enemy we have. \"That makes for a sort of anxiety bred into us, Dr. Junz, a fear of planets. We\u0027re only happy in space; that\u0027s the only place we can feel safe.\" \"And you don\u0027t feel that way any longer, Rik?\" \"I certainly don\u0027t. I don\u0027t even remember feeling that way. That\u0027s it, you see. The Townman had set his psychic probe to remove feelings of anxiety and he hadn\u0027t bothered to set the intensity controls. He thought he had a recent, superficial trouble to deal with. Instead there was this deep, ingrained anxiety he knew nothing of. He got rid of all of it. In a sense, it-was worth getting rid of it even though so much else went with it. I don\u0027t have to stay in space now. I can go back to Earth. I can work there and Earth needs men. It always will.\" \"You know,\" Junz said, \"why can\u0027t we do for Earth what we\u0027re doing for Florina? There\u0027s no need to bring up Earthmen in such fear and insecurity. The Galaxy is big.\" \"No,\" said Rik vehemently. \"It\u0027s a different case. Earth has its past, Dr. Junz. Many people may not believe it, but we of Earth know that Earth was the original planet of the human race.\" \"Well, perhaps. I can\u0027t say, one way or the other.\" \"It was. It\u0027s a planet that can\u0027t be abandoned; it mustn\u0027t be abandoned. Someday we\u0027ll change it, change its surface back to what it once must have been. Till then-we\u0027re staying.\" Valona said softly, \"And I\u0027m an Earthwoman now.\" Rik was looking out at the horizon. Upper City was as garish as ever, but the people were gone. He said, \"How many are left on Florina?\" \"About twenty million,\" said Junz. \"We work slower as we go along. We have to keep our withdrawals balanced. The people that are left must always maintain themselves as an economic unit in the months that are left. Of course, resettlement is in its earliest stages. Most of the evacuees are still in temporary camps on neighboring worlds. There is unavoidable hardship.\" \"When will the last person leave?\" \"Never, really.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"The Townman has applied unofficially for permission to remain. It\u0027s been granted, also unofficially. It won\u0027t be a matter of public record.\" \"Remain?\" Elk was shocked. \"But for the sake of all the Galaxy, why?\" \"I didn\u0027t know,\" said Junz, \"but I think you explained it when you talked of Earth. He feels as you do. He says he can\u0027t bear the thought of leaving Florina to die alone.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-currents-of-space-galactic-empire-2/page-20.html","bookId":1725,"book":{"id":1725,"title":"The Currents of Space (Galactic Empire #2)","description":"Storyline: The Currents of Space (Galactic Empire #2) High above planet Florinia, the Squires of Sark live in unimaginable wealth and comfort. Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed. Barely able to speak or care for himself when he was found, Rik is widely regarded as a simpleton by the worker community where he lives. As his memories begin to return, however, Rik finds himself driven by a cryptic message he is determined to deliver: Everyone on Florinia is doomedâ€¦the Currents of Space are bringing destruction. But if the planet is evacuated, the power of Sark will end-so there are those who would kill the messenger. The fate of the Galaxy hangs in the balance.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-currents-of-space-galactic-empire-2.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-currents-of-space-galactic-empire-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:31 AM"}}
