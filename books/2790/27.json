Dr. Rivers!\" Marin started to fumble for the phone. \"Of course, I didn\u0027t recognize you without a threatening upraised fist. You\u0027re not on the list, but I\u0027m sure it will be all right. Let me just notify Her Highness—\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t do that,\" Jenny interrupted. \"It\u0027s a surprise.\"\\n\\n \"Jenny, you know I can\u0027t do that.\"\\n\\n \"Trust me,\" Shel said, \"if you call her, it\u0027s all over.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s all over?\"\\n\\n \"Jenny!\"\\n\\n They all turned at the boyish shout. Sheldon immediately recognized the youngest Baranov, Prince Nicholas.\\n\\n \"Your Highness,\" Jenny said, bowing. Marin stood and also bowed. \"It\u0027s past your bedtime, Prince Nicky.\"\\n\\n \"Jenny, I\u0027m fourteen years old. I\u0027ll tell myself when to go to bed, okay?\" He tried to sound tough, but with the angelic blond curls and large blue eyes, couldn\u0027t pull it off. Impulsively, he hugged her. \"Welcome back.\"\\n\\n \"Your Highness, this is—\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Rivers!\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yes. Dr. Rivers, this is Prince Nicholas Baranov, sixth in line to—\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God, you\u0027rehere !\" The young prince—just entering that lanky stage of all height, no weight—goggled at him. \"Alex is going toshit .\"\\n\\n \"Language, Your Highness.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, Jenn, but she is.\"\\n\\n \"Actually,\" Jenny said, eyeing Marin, who was still standing beside her desk, \"there seems to be some question as to whether he can come up…\"\\n\\n \"He can come up,\" the prince said, doing a startling imitation of his father\u0027s cool, used-to-being-obeyed tone.They must teach them that when they\u0027re baby royals , Shel mused. \"He absolutely can. Alex has been crying her—I mean, she\u0027s been really upset. I know she wants to see him. I don\u0027t know about you, though,\" he added, sizing Crane up.\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon, Prince Nicky. This is my fiance, Crane Grange.\"\\n\\n Nicky frowned. \"I guess I missed some memos.\"\\n\\n Crane shook his hand. \"It\u0027s nice to meet you, Prince Nicholas. Jenny\u0027s told me a lot of wonderful things about you.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t a bomb, by the way,\" the prince said. \"Don\u0027t believe everything you read.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027ll sign here, sir,\" Marin said, extending a clipboard in Sheldon\u0027s direction.\\n\\n He took it, and signed in as a guest. \"Just like that, huh?\" he asked, handing it back.\\n\\n Nicky grinned. \"Just like that.\"\\n\\n Chapter 48\\n\\n \"Come,\" she called, grateful for the interruption. She needed a break from the pacing. Not to mention the crying. The palace was the same, but nothing else was.\\n\\n Oh, and now she was hallucinating. Because it looked like Sheldon was walking through her door. Her suite. In the palace. Where he would never ever go. Because he—\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready,\" he said, stopping three feet in front of her, \"to listen to your apology.\"\\n\\n She stared.\\n\\n \"Also,\" he added, \"I\u0027m ignoring the fact that your little \u0027apartment\u0027 is bigger than the NDISL.\"\\n\\n She stared some more.\\n\\n \"Well?\" he demanded, hands on his hips. \"Aren\u0027t you going to say a thing? Did I mention how much I hate flying? Because I fucking hate it. And not only was I facing death by horrifying crash every second I was on the plane, I had to watch Jenny and Crane make goo-goo eyes at each other. For hours! So you\u0027d better say something.\"\\n\\n \"Is that an apology?\" she managed.\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" he snapped. \"You left. I said I love you, and you were leavin\u0027 on a jet plane like a bad Peter, Paul, and Mary song.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I love you, too,\" she snapped, \"but I knew better than to say so!\"\\n\\n \"Oh yeah?\" He was shrugging out of his coat. \"You could have fooled me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, like you were going to quit your job and move and be a prince. Next thing you know, you\u0027ll be ordering brie as a dessert course.\" She yanked off her robe.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a totally different issue,\" he insisted, unbuckling his belt. \"I put myself out there and you left. Didn\u0027t even say it back.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I wanted to!\" She pulled her nightgown over her head. \"How could I ask you to move again, knowing you hate it so much? Knowing you were so happy at the NDISL? I love you, so I let you go.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice for a cross-stitch sampler,\" he said, kicking out of his shoes and slacks and unbuttoning his shirt, \"but this is real life. And in real life, when someone you love says \u0027I love you,\u0027 you say it back.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I love you.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" She looked down at his feet. \"You\u0027re going to take off your socks, right?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, no, it\u0027s freezing in this place.\"\\n\\n She laughed and rushed into his arms. \"It\u0027s almost summer.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God. Let\u0027s not talk about it.\"\\n\\n They tumbled into her bed, her solitary bed, lonely no more, and kissed like reunited lovers—which they were—and purred and stroked each other, and whispered words of sweetness, of love, and the only thing that held her down was nothing, and it was all very fine.\\n\\n And she came, and cried, and apologized, and he came, and kissed her tears away, and apologized, and held her, and she held him, and she was in love, and it was beyond all, it was like coming home. Finally, oh finally, she was home.\\n\\n Chapter 49\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t I be your consort?\" Shel begged. \"Do I have to be a prince?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not so bad,\" David said. He had returned from North Dakota that morning, and the whole family was together for lunch. Dara and Sheldon had taken an instant dislike to each other, and they were both giving each other guarded looks from across the table. \"There\u0027s an excellent dental plan, for example.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Al said. \"Believe me, you don\u0027t look like a prince. At all. I\u0027d make you the Duke of Shit if I could.\"\\n\\n \"Now that\u0027s got a nice ring to it,\" Alex\u0027s sister Kathryn said. Sheldon could see the promise of immense gorgeousness in the brunette teenager, and briefly pitied his future father-in-law. \"The Duke of Shit! Think what the family crest would look like.\"\\n\\n Nicky laughed and spit pea soup out of his nose. Dara laughed, too, and drooled peas down her chin, to be swiftly wiped up by her mother.\\n\\n \"Sorry, Shel,\" Alex said with real sympathy. \"By law, the spouse of the prince or princess is himself (or herself) a prince or princess. And I might as well tell you, you\u0027re going to get stuck with a bunch more titles, too.\"\\n\\n \"Like Lord of Losers,\" Kathryn suggested.\\n\\n \"And by the way, if we\u0027re celebrating my official engagement,\" Alex demanded, \"why are we serving a vegetable I hate?\"\\n\\n \"Quitcher bitching,\" the king ordered. \"They\u0027re cheap this time of year. You know what it costs to feed all you bums?\"\\n\\n \"I have the figure, sir,\" Edmund said, standing very properly at the king\u0027s right elbow.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay,\" Shel said hastily. \"I don\u0027t want to know.\"\\n\\n \"I also have the figures on what it cost to ship your things from North Dakota.\"\\n\\n Alex frowned at him. \"I told you I\u0027d pay for that.\"\\n\\n \"And I told you to forget about it. Bad enough I\u0027ve got maids and—and footmen and someone\u0027s secretly folding my socks. I mean, I\u0027m freaking out just sitting in this room. Although, it helps that you\u0027re all kind of jerky. If you were stiff and proper, this would be a lot worse.\"\\n\\n \"I think the Duke of Shit just insulted us,\" Christina said.\\n\\n \"Language, please, Your Highness.\"\\n\\n \"Cram it, Edmund.\"\\n\\n \"Speaking of stiff and proper,\" Jenny said hastily from Alex\u0027s right elbow, \"if I may, the invitation to Prince William\u0027s wedding came in the morning packet.\"\\n\\n \"I told you!\" the king said, stopping in mid gnaw on his lamb chop to crow. \"I knew she couldn\u0027t say no to me. Us, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Unfortunately, sir, you\u0027re already scheduled to be in New York that day to address the U.N. It is not a thing to be rearranged.\"\\n\\n \"Right, right. Well, I\u0027ll call her.\"\\n\\n \"No need,\" Edmund said hastily. \"I have already extended regrets on the family\u0027s behalf.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, then. We got any more a\u0027 these chops?\"\\n\\n \"Dad, for God\u0027s sake,\" Kathryn said, rolling her eyes. \"We\u0027re all still on the soup course.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my fault you\u0027re all slow, like cows in a pasture?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great,\" Alex muttered.\\n\\n \"He called us all cows,\" Prince Alexander said and, to Shel\u0027s startlement, continued in verse:\\n\\n \"Another way of saying\\n\\n I love you, children.\"\\n\\n \"You stop that,\" Kathryn ordered. \"You haven\u0027t done the haiku thing in ages. You\u0027re just showing off for Sheldon.\"\\n\\n \"You guys areso weird,\" Shel said, staring into his soup. \"I can\u0027t believe I gave up nice, sane North Dakota for this.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but you did,\" Alex said, squeezing his leg under the table. \"Remind me to thank you again later.\"\\n\\n \"Gross!\" Kathryn, Alexander, and Nicky all screamed in unison.\\n\\n \"Not until you\u0027re married,\" the king said, \"or I break your spine, boy. Possibly in more than one place.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re killin\u0027 me,\" Shel groaned, in a credible imitation of the king.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s awful, I know. But look at this, this is nice,\" Christina said, admiring the announcement in theJuneau News . \"You actually don\u0027t look like you\u0027re going to hit the photographer.\"\\n\\n \"He caught me in a weak moment,\" Shel admitted. A post-coital moment, in fact. But what the king didn\u0027t know wouldn\u0027t hurt him. \"If we can\u0027t do it until we\u0027re married,\" he informed his bride-to-be, \"then the date just moved up by six months.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-27.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \\n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
