The king had been so pleased that she\u0027d accepted it—that Shel hadn\u0027t insisted on buying something himself—he\u0027d had to leave the room. In truth, Sheldon didn\u0027t care. If he was going to accept the royal thing, he would take all of it, not pick and choose as Christina tried to do. Alex came with the whole mess, and that was good enough for him. She wanted to please her father by wearing her mom\u0027s wedding jewelry? That was fine. In return, she had sworn never to make him eat artisanal cheese, and that was fine, too. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not running away,\" she said, \"but it\u0027s bad luck to see me before the wedding.\" \"Hey, it wasn\u0027t my idea, sunshine. You\u0027re the one who came charging out of the palace like a royal pain.\" \"Oh, is that what I am?\" \"Sure.\" He took her in his arms, carefully, mindful of the hair and the pearls and the dress and even the pointy shoes. \"But in a few minutes, you\u0027ll bemy royal pain. Her Highness Alexandria Baranov Rivers.\" \"Aw,\" she said, presenting her ripe, red mouth for a kiss. \"Just call me Alex.\" They kissed for a lovely long time and oh, it was sublime, she really was like something out of a fairy tale, she— \"Hey! Hey! You two! Cut the shit! You\u0027re gonna miss your own wedding!\" The king was stomping toward them, Alex\u0027s bouquet of calla lilies—red and white and green—all mashed together in the king\u0027s fist. \"I mean it! Let go! Both of you! Come on, we got a houseful of people waiting on you. Jesus Christ, will youstop kissing for five seconds ?\" \"Probably not,\" Shel said, and hugged his bride so hard, a Baranov pearl popped out of her headdress and rolled away in the grass, glossy cream against the dying green. \"I will turn the hose on you guys. Come on, you\u0027ve lasted six months, it\u0027s only a couple hours more. Guys?\" The king was pleading, brandishing Alex\u0027s bouquet like a sword, jabbing it at them like they were fighting dogs that needed to be separated. \"Come on, I\u0027m giving a royal command here. Let\u0027s just go inside and we can do this and then you can have a tiny hot dog. Guys? Okay? Guys?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-30.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem. Some princess expects him to wait on her, hand and dimpled foot. His boss is taken with the royal redhead -- brunette, whatever, it\u0027s not like he keeps track of that stuff -- and nobody realizes that he just wants to be left alone in his lab. All alone. All the time. Weekends, holidays -- it\u0027s all good. Now here\u0027s Miss Royalpants, insisting that he escort her around the marine institute, explain what he s doing, kiss her until her toes curl -- no, wait, that was his idea. She\u0027s not even apologetic about being born into a royal family! Says it\u0027s his problem to overcome, not hers. Which leaves him with one option: to kiss her again. And again. And... So she\u0027s nothing like he expected. In fact, Dr. Rivers can see that this fantastic, exasperating woman has problems no princess should ever have to deal with. And he has an idea to help her get some much-needed sleep.
