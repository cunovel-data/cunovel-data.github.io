Well, actually, I will. My brother\u0027s coming tonight to crash for a couple of days.\" \"Crane, Robin, Crow, or Raven?\" He looked pleased. \"Hey, you remembered! You listen real good.\" \"It\u0027s my job.\" She added through gritted teeth, \"Which I\u0027mvery very very good at.\" \"Whoa. Okay, calm down. And sit down.\" He led her to the couch. \"I know you\u0027re not the boozing type, but I really think you need a drink.\" \"Very well. And you didn\u0027t answer my question,\" she called after him as he disappeared into the kitchen. \"Crane. Robin and Raven are my sisters. Anyway, I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d—I mean, when I told him he could crash here I honestly never thought you\u0027d even see my—anyway, he\u0027s coming tonight.\" \"I won\u0027t stay long, then,\" she said, \"No no no. I mean, stay as long as you want. I don\u0027t give a shit.\" He held out a small glass half filled with yellowish-brown liquid. \"Cognac?\" she asked, sniffing doubtfully. \"Jack Daniel\u0027s. Drink up.\" She did, and instantly assumed the action was going to kill her. It seemed as if her lungs, trachea, and stomach were all trying to leap out onto Teal\u0027s dun-colored carpet at once. \"Feel better?\" he asked solicitously, downing his own drink and smacking his lips. \"Loads,\" she gasped, putting the glass down on the newspapers with fingers that trembled. That was when she noticed… \"How many copies of the paper did you buy?\" \"Well, all my sibs wanted a copy. And my folks. And I bought one for his mom, because God knowshe won\u0027t think of it. He\u0027s real insensitive like that,\" Teal confided, plopping down on the couch beside her. \"Men can be that way,\" she said darkly. \"Ah-ha! So it\u0027s the king you\u0027re pissed at, not Alex.\" \"I\u0027m just… tired. I\u0027m ready to go back home. I really want to get back home.\" She realized how grumpy and inappropriate that sounded and hastily regrouped. \"Not that it isn\u0027t a lovely state, but I just—I—\" \"You want another drink?\" he asked, green eyes anxious. \"No! I mean, no thank you. I want… you.\" \"What? Ow! Hey, that\u0027s my last clean shirt. Be careful with—\" Then he wasn\u0027t talking anymore, lord be praised, because she had seized him with her tiny fists, her lust and anger giving her the strength of the gods. She pulled him close to her and mashed her lips on his for a good long time. \"Please let me go,\" he gasped after a minute. \"Take me into your bedroom,\" she growled. \"Seriously, I\u0027ve got some mace around here I think… I got it for my sister\u0027s birthday, but that\u0027s not \u0027til next month…\" \"Make love to me.\" \"But… okay. No, wait! Look, you\u0027re great and all, but you know the same thing as me.\" \"What? Nevermind. Less talking,\" she ordered. \"More undressing.\" He was trying to gently fend her off with an elbow as she rained kisses on his neck. \"Ack! That tickles. Look, Jenn, I think you\u0027re cool and all—well, a little starchy, maybe—but you don\u0027t want to do this. You really don\u0027t.\" \"Yes I do. Do you have condoms?\" \"Yes I do. Wait a minute! Aren\u0027t you listening to a damn word? We don\u0027t have a thing in common. If I was in Alaska, you\u0027d never have given me a second look.\" \"That\u0027s not true,\" she muttered into his neck. \"I think you\u0027re extremely attractive and annoyingly sexy.\" \"Well, yeah, there\u0027s definitely a chemistry thing going on here, but that\u0027s all. You\u0027ll be really mad at yourself in the morning.\" \"A pleasant change from being mad at—at things out of my control.\" \"Ah-ha!\" \"Stop saying that. What\u0027s wrong with your belt? It\u0027s like there\u0027s a combination lock on it.\" \"Look, just… stop that…\" He grabbed her hands and forced them into her lap. \"Just… calm down now and stop getting me all worked up. I mean, I\u0027m a nice fuckin\u0027 guy but only for so long.\" \"Too long,\" she grumped. \"Just, take a breath, okay? Relax. Caaaaaalm down. You\u0027re having a shitty day—week, maybe—and that happens to everybody.\" \"That has nothing to do with anything.\" \"No, no, it\u0027s okay! Shit, just the other day, some dildo-brain was all, \u0027I can\u0027t find the bail on my reel\u0027 and nearly poked my eye—never mind, it\u0027s boring. Anyway, my point is, you shouldn\u0027t do something you\u0027ll regret the shit out of later, just because the king hurt your feelings.\" \"He didn\u0027t mean it,\" she said automatically. \"He was upset.\" \"Well, yeah! Believe me, I got the whole yuck-o story from Shel this morning.\" \"You did?\" She didn\u0027t know if that was horrifying, or a relief. Of course, Dr. Rivers wasn\u0027t under the same constraints as she was. He wasn\u0027t staff, he was… something else. \"Oh, yeah! The king! Coming out of nowhere like Batman! Busted in on them! Practically naked! Shel and Alex, I mean. Then he freaks out and practically has Shel shot on the spot.Then he takes \u0027em out for dinner—I dunno which is worse.\" \"Thanks for the recap,\" she said dryly, \"but I was there.\" \"It\u0027s no wonder everybody\u0027s upset. The way I hear it, that guy fills up every room he\u0027s ever in. I can\u0027t think of a better way to squash a, what d\u0027you call it, a budding romance.\" \"Is that what it is?\" she asked, immediately alert. \"Because the princess doesn\u0027t… I mean, she has had no long-term involvements. Ever.\" That was safe enough. Anyone who had readPeople magazine knew that much. \"Trust me: they\u0027re going to get married. I havenever seen Shel this rattled. He\u0027s overlooked all his prejudices to be with her. Next thing, he\u0027ll be eating cheese.\" \"He—the king—he implied that I—that I had not been doing my job.\" Teal laughed so hard he almost fell off the couch. Jenny stared at him coldly. \"I fail to see the humor you\u0027ve found.\" \"Do you hear yourself, woman? Nobody with half a brain could ever think that, not in a million years of thinking. You have no life! Everybody knows that!\" She cheered up a little. \"Really?\" \"Honey, you\u0027re pathetic! You didn\u0027t even bring blue jeans… to North Dakota! The princess had toorder you to actually leave the hotel to even go on a date.\" She cheered up more. \"That\u0027s true.\" \"It\u0027s so fuckin\u0027 stupid that you\u0027ve got this idea in your head thatanybody thinks you\u0027re doing a bad job, much less King Hot Shit.\" \"Mr. Grange!\" \"See? You can\u0027t even be mad at him properly. You suck at that, too! And youreally suck at being bad at your job.\" She smiled a little. \"You\u0027re just saying that to cheer me up.\" \"No, Jenn, I swear! You\u0027re the biggest workaholic loser I\u0027ve ever seen.\" She rested her head on his shoulder. \"You\u0027re very sweet.\" \"And weird, did I mention weird? Because if I said all that shit to any other girl on the planet, she\u0027d kick me in the nuts.\" \"No, the time for foreplay has passed,\" she sighed. She straightened up, patted her hair, and made sure her shirt was tucked in. \"You\u0027re right, it would have been an error of grotesque proportions.\" \"Jeez, I didn\u0027t exactly put it like—\" She took one of his blocky hands in hers and squeezed. \"Thank you for not taking advantage of me, Teal. I\u0027ll always be grateful. I never would have forgiven myself for doing something so impulsively unwise.\" \"Uh, you\u0027re welcome.\" \"You were so sweet to listen to my problems and help me understand them a little better.\" \"I\u0027m an asshole,\" he grumped. \"Golden opportunity to get laid by a hottie and I talk her out of it.\" \"Yes, you did,\" she said happily, standing. \"And you\u0027ve earned my eternal devotion and friendship.\" \"Great. That and a fuckin\u0027 dollar, I can buy a Coke.\" \"I\u0027ll buy you all the Cokes you want,\" she promised. \"But first you must take me back to the hotel.\" \"Welcome back, non-bowling workaholic loser.\" \"It\u0027s good to be me,\" she said, completely seriously. Chapter 32 \"Come,\" the king called. The knock on the door, quick and firm, came again. \"Come onin\" the king called, louder. Wham! Wham! Wham! \"Jesus!\" the king screamed. \"Come in, for Christ\u0027s sake!\" \"Come,\" Alex said, and the door opened. \"Hi, Shel.\" \"That\u0027s gonna get real fuckin\u0027 old real quick,\" the king said. \"It\u0027sher room,\" Shel retorted. He walked in, slung his pack on an empty chair—to Alex\u0027s extreme relief, it didn\u0027t clink—and sat down beside Alex on the small couch. Her father was sprawled behind one of the desks, doing another of his dratted puzzles… the crossword, this time. \"So, am I interrupting anything?\" \"Naw,\" Al replied. \"We\u0027re just talking about some upcoming stuff. Weddings and shit. What\u0027s a four-letter word for to hit or push against?\" \"Butt,\" Shel said. \"Hmmm.\" He scribbled it down. \"So, you two going out tonight, or what?\" \"We usually stay in,\" Alex said smoothly. \"Order room service, watch a movie.\" \"Sounds like plenty.\" \"How longart you staying?\" Shel asked pointedly. Her father gave him a look she knew well. \"Dunno. I just got here. It\u0027s real pretty here. I might stay a while. Now quit buggin\u0027 me, I gotta think. Four letter word,\" he mused aloud, \"for advance.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-19.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
