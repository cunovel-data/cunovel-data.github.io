We both got ours and now we\u0027re being adults about it.\n Then how come he felt so shitty?\n Chapter 12\n \"This has been nice,\" she said as they pulled up to the hotel.\n \"Yeah, a laugh a minute,\" he said flatly. He put the car in park and slung an arm over the back of the seat, looking at her. \"That\u0027s a new one for me. The snow bank.\"\n She giggled; she couldn\u0027t help it. \"Not for me. I\u0027m from Alaska.\"\n At last, at last he smiled. Oh, she loved that smile. \"Spare me your snowy lovemaking ways. On second thought, don\u0027t.\"\n There was a pause, and she realized he was waiting for her to invite him up to her room.\n \"Thanks again for—\" The tour. The smile. The fabulous big cock. The laugh. The ride. The other ride. \"—for everything.\"\n \"No big. Are you sure you don\u0027t… uh… need anything?\"\n \"No. It\u0027s been a long day, and Jenny\u0027s going to want to debrief me. I\u0027d better get up there.\"\n \"Yeah, okay. Well, see you later.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" she replied, \"I\u0027ll have to check my schedule.\" She opened her car door and stuck a leg out, only to stop in surprise when she felt his arm on her elbow.\n \"Just a minute here,\" he said, squinting at her in the sudden glare of the dome light. \"Just so we\u0027re clear,I\u0027m givingyou the brush-off. Right? I mean, we had a one-night stand and now I\u0027m the one saying that was nice, see you never.\"\n \"Oh, of course,\" she assured him. \"That seems fine to me.\"\n \"Wait a minute!\"\n She stopped again in mid climb. \"What?\"\n \"It sounds like you thinkyou\u0027re the one givingme the brush-off.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m really going to be very busy in the next few weeks…\"\n \"So am I!\"\n \"Okay,\" she said, trying to keep her temper. What the hell was this guy getting so worked up over? Not to sound like a reverse chauvinist, but he was a guy. He got laid and there weren\u0027t any strings. He should be zooming off into the dark, singing a happy tune. \"So I guess this is goodbye.\"\n \"Like hell it is!\" he nearly shrieked.\n \"For God\u0027s sake, will you keep it down? Thereare people with guns around, you know.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got news for you,Princess . We\u0027re going on adate . Tomorrow.\"\n \"But my itinerary…\"\n \"Shove your itinerary up your tight ass.\"\n \"You never mind my ass!\" she cried, stung.\n \"We\u0027re going out. This wasnot a one-night stand. Repeat,\" he added through gritted teeth, \"after me.\"\n \"This wasnot a one-night stand,\" she parroted obediently.\n \"Damn right it wasn\u0027t! So cancel whatever you have to cancel; I\u0027m picking you up at seven.\"\n \"We could have a nice dinner in my hotel room,\" she suggested.\n \"You\u0027re damn right we could!\"\n She finally escaped from the car, and watched from the sidewalk as he roared off.\n Chapter 13\n The phone was ringing as she stepped into her hotel suite. Jenny rose to meet her, picked up the phone, and said, \"Good evening, Your Majesty… yes, she\u0027s right here… at once, Sir.\"\n Alex took the phone, covered the receiver with her palm, and whispered, \"I have to shift some things around tomorrow night.\"\n Jenny looked vaguely alarmed. \"Yes, Princess.\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you about it later. Get to your own room; it\u0027s late.\"\n \"Yes, Princess, and good night.\"\n Alex slumped onto the couch, returned Jenny\u0027s wave, kicked off her shoes, and said, \"What are you still doing up, Dad?\"\n \"Me? How about you? It\u0027s, what, three o\u0027clock in the morning there? The hell? What have you been doing?\"\n \"Meeting the locals.\" She swallowed a yawn. \"Shouldn\u0027t you be signing a bill into a law or something?\"\n \"Off my case, you little jerk. Did you know about this?\"\n \"About what, Dad?\" she asked patiently.\n \"That this little trip was going to be practically for a month!\"\n \"Dad, my schedule\u0027s been on your desk for over a week.\"\n \"So? I still say they tricked me.\"\n \"Read your damn schedules,\" she told the king, \"and quitcher bitchin\u0027.\"\n \"Nice way to talk to your father. And your sovereign!\"\n \"I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.\"\n He chuckled. \"Betthat tasted bad.\"\n \"I can do the dance when I want. We all can, isn\u0027t that right? How\u0027s the baby?\"\n \"Fiendishly smart.\"\n \"How\u0027s Nicky?\"\n \"Got tossed out of A.L. Prep for blowing up the teacher\u0027s lounge.\"\n \"Ooooh, ouch! What a budding sociopath you\u0027re raising, Your Majesty.\"\n \"Me! This is all Edmund\u0027s fault. I just have to figure out how. The boy\u0027s on his way back; he\u0027s due in here a couple hours. Then he gets the reaming of his life. You\u0027re lucky you\u0027re there, because the press is going apeshit here.\"\n She shuddered. \"Makes me glad I\u0027m a thousand miles away. On the other hand, if people think he\u0027s dangerous, they won\u0027t mess with him.\"\n \"Uh… yeah.\" The king coughed. \"Anybody giving you trouble out there? Funds doing okay?\"\n \"Dad, it\u0027s only been a day, my funds are fine. And everybody\u0027s very nice. Except this one guy—Dr. Rivers.\"\n \"So, get rid of him.\"\n \"No, I kind of like that he\u0027s so grumpy. Seriously, I don\u0027t think he gives a tin shit that I\u0027m a Baranov.\"\n \"I smell fortune hunter.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t if you\u0027d seen his… clothes.\" She\u0027d almost said \"underwear.\"\n \"They\u0027re the worst kinds. The poor ones.\"\n \"I thought you said the ones who had a little money but were greedy for more were the worst ones.\"\n \"Well, they\u0027re more guidelines than rules. I still think you should get rid of him if he\u0027s bugging you. Have Jenny take care of it.\"\n \"I dunno, he\u0027s okay.\" She could hear herself slipping into her father\u0027s speech pattern; the first voice she had ever heard, the one she loved the most. \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 about seein\u0027 him again tomorrow.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"Like I said, he\u0027s bugging me, but in a good way.\"\n \"Seeing him, like on a date?\"\n \"That\u0027s what he said. Insisted, actually.\"\n \"Well, good for you! And you may, once I get the paperwork on him—\"\n \"Dad!\"\n \"—and Jenny and your guards turn in their reports—\"\n \"Daaaaaaaaaaad!\"\n \"What? It\u0027s standard op, sweetie.\"\n \"Embarrassing, is what it is,\" she grumbled.\n \"Tough titty.\"\n \"Language!\"\n \"Look who\u0027s talking,\" he said, and laughed and hung up with a loud click.\n Chapter 14\n \"… and we\u0027ve moved the fund-raising dinner to Wednesday, to accommodate your… private meeting… with Dr. Rivers.\"\n \"Snarky, snarky,\" Alex said, not looking up from the newspaper.\n \"He isn\u0027t worthy of your interest, Your Highness, and I can\u0027t help it if that\u0027s how I feel.\" Jenny\u0027s lip actually curled. Alex was amazed. \"Dr. Rivers. Hmph.\"\n \"You sound about sixty years old when you do that.\"\n \"He could have shown more respect.\"\n \"Yes, he could have,\" she said, smiling. \"But he didn\u0027t.\"\n Her suite was on the eastern side of the hotel, and the sun had come up in a blaze of spring glory, making all the silverware and dishes look as though they were on fire. Truly, a gorgeous day. And best of all, no nightmares! Instead, she had paced and thought and fretted and read, the grumpy Dr. Rivers never far from her mind.\n \"Another thing, Your Highness, if you\u0027ll allow me.\"\n \"Mmmm?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think—that is—I noticed that—\"\n She yawned. \"Spit it out, Jenn.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think forcing yourself to stay awake is the best solution for your… problem.\"\n Alex turned the page, skimmed the \"Lifetime\" section, read about her arrival in town, and after the long, heavy silence, Jenny took the hint and busied herself with returning phone calls and distributing the many flower bouquets sent to honor the Princess on her journey to the Midwest.\n \"Ooooh,\" Teal teased, walking into Shel\u0027s office. \"Got a big date?\"\n \"As a matter of fact, yes.\" He was practically strangling himself trying to get the knot right in his tie, and for what?She certainly didn\u0027t seem the type to care. \"And you\u0027re coming with me.\"\n \"Aw.\" Teal moved a stack of journals to one side and sat in the chair. \"That\u0027s really sweet, Shel, but I think of you as a friend. I\u0027m not saying I don\u0027t find you attractive, because you\u0027re a good-looking guy, but I think we shouldn\u0027t risk ruining our friendship by taking it to the next level.\"\n \"Are you done?\"\n \"No. Be gentle, it\u0027s my—\"\n \"Shut the hell up and help me tie this thing.\" Teal obligingly got up and, with a few deft motions, had a neat Windsor tied. Shel nearly cried with relief. \"Thanks.\"\n \"I can tie a fly on a line so fine you can\u0027t see it, I can do a tie. Anything for you, beautiful.\"\n \"And you\u0027re coming with me, like I said. I\u0027m seeing Alex, and you\u0027re going to take her \u0027I must be everywhere the Princess is\u0027 gal-pal out.\"\n Teal\u0027s green eyes widened. \"Jenny? That gorgeous brunette who looks like—\"\n \"Shania Twain, yeah, yeah, I heard you babbling about that while I was rotting in jail. That American singer, right?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-9.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
