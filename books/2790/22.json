A smile which instantly froze on her face.\\n\\n \"Hi, Jenn. This is my brother, Crane.\"\\n\\n She said nothing.\\n\\n Crane held out a manicured hand. The nails were neatly short, and buffed. She stared at it. \"A great pleasure to meet you,\" he rumbled. \"Teal\u0027s told me so many great things about you.\"\\n\\n A short, difficult silence followed.\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" Teal said finally, giving her a strange look, \"we thought we\u0027d pop by, try to talk you into coming out for a beer. Not that you drink beer. Maybe a coffee? We can probably find a place that\u0027ll serve coffee without drowning it in whipped cream…\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s an excellent wine bar about six blocks from here,\" Crane said. \"I had a 1944 Sauternes there.\"\\n\\n Jenny\u0027s tongue felt frozen in her mouth.\\n\\n \"Of course, the port from that year was dreadful.\"\\n\\n \"You—\"\\n\\n Teal rolled his eyes. \"I know, what a fucking stiff! \u0027Dreadful,\u0027 who says dreadful?\"\\n\\n \"Someone with a more developed brain than you, little brother,\" Crane retorted.\\n\\n \"Shut the hell up. Jenn, are you going to shake his hand or is it going to just hang in the air all night?\"\\n\\n She shook the hand, which was strong and smooth at the same time. \"I\u0027m—I\u0027m very pleased to meet you.\" She glanced over at his brother and hissed, \"You didn\u0027t tell me you had an identical twin!\"\\n\\n Teal shrugged. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m a bit of the family black sheep,\" Crane said politely, staring at her with green, green eyes. \"Everyone else works outdoors as trainers or guides or what-have-you. I rebelled a bit.\"\\n\\n \"Went fag is more like it,\" Teal said helpfully.\\n\\n She took in the dark suit, the white shirt, the polished black shoes, the clean-shaven features. \"Wh—what do you do?\" she asked, staring up at him with helpless longing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m third violin for the Boston Symphony.\"\\n\\n \"Symphony,\" she breathed, swaying on her heels.\\n\\n \"Yes, well, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m out here sulking, I missed my shot at second chair. My brother offered to cheer me up, and so here I am.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great. I mean awful. Very very awful. You know, there\u0027s a symphony in Anchorage. And the king has wanted to get one started in Juneau. But it\u0027s difficult to get musicians to come all that way.\"\\n\\n He smiled down at her. \"Really? I can\u0027t think of a single reason not to go.\"\\n\\n Ohhhhhhhhhhhh…\\n\\n \"Beer? Wine? Tequila? Anything? You guys? Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Do you know, you look extraordinarily like the ballerina Greta Hodgkinson?\"\\n\\n She gasped. \"You know, I\u0027ve always thought so!\"\\n\\n Chapter 37\\n\\n \"This place,\" Teal said, \"is the worst. I mean, it blows. It blows rocks.\"\\n\\n \"Hush, Teal,\" Crane said, almost absently, staring raptly into Jenny\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \"We had to drive almost two hours to get here? Jesus.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Jenny said. \"Hush.\"\\n\\n \"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" he grumped, reading the menu again, which still only had three entrees on it. Three! Any decent restaurant had pages and pages of menu you could flip through. \"You can\u0027t even get a burger here!\"\\n\\n \"Ohhh, how wonderful,\" Jenny breathed. \"No burgers.\"\\n\\n \"But they have a lovely marbled strip steak, which they serve with the most cunning b‚arnaise sauce… I think it has a hint of chervil in it. It\u0027s nothing I\u0027ve been able to put my finger on…\"\\n\\n \"Oh, delicious,\" Jenny said. \"I\u0027d like to have that, please. Except on bread; skip the steak.\"\\n\\n \"And Idon\u0027t want something that looks like the dog threw up on it before they brought it to my table,\" Teal griped. \"Isn\u0027t anything in this place plain, for a working man? I mean, shee-it.\"\\n\\n His twin and his friend looked at him with identical reproachful expressions, and Teal almost shuddered. Usually, his ideas were in the majority—Crane was definitely the black sheep of the family. And whatever friend they were hanging out with—like Shel, for instance—usually blew off the fancy sauces, especially if they were cheese-based.\\n\\n Now, for the first time in his life, Crane was in the company of people who held the class-based high ground—and knew it. He felt like shriveling in his chair. Which pissed him off. Which made him feel like talking more.\\n\\n \"I mean, why fuck up a perfectly good piece of red meat? Why fancy it up with all that shit? Why not just throw it on the grill for ten minutes on each side and you\u0027re all set? Maybe with some mashed on the side…\"\\n\\n Jenny shivered and Crane patted her hand. \"You can\u0027t overcook red meat, Teal. All the flavor will be lost. And the sauce works in concert with the full-bodied flavor of the meat. Assuming you even want red meat.\"\\n\\n \"Too true,\" Crane said, nodding, \"and if you serve it with anything, it should be with something a little more delicate, in contrast to the robust texture of the meat.\"\\n\\n \"Like saut‚ed morel mushrooms,\" Jenny added. \"Or, out of season, perhaps straw mushrooms. And perhaps some saut‚ed baby spinach on the side.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds heavenly,\" Crane breathed.\\n\\n \"Great. A serving of mold next to my pile of dog barf.\"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" they both murmured.\\n\\n \"Christ on a stick,\" Teal grumbled. The waiter edged over and—and! They talked about wine for. Ten. Minutes. Red wine, white wine, oaked wine, whatever the fuck that was. Ice wine, which wasn\u0027t appropriate until dessert, assuming he made it that long.\\n\\n Finally… finally! Crane and Jenn had ordered their glasses, and the waiter was looking at him expectantly.\\n\\n \"Do you speak beer?\" he asked him.\\n\\n \"Yes, of course,\" the waiter said, and Teal nearly swooned. \"We have an excellent selection from Europe: Kolsch, Staroproman, Warsteiner, Zipfer, and, of course, Hoegartner.\"\\n\\n Teal whimpered.\\n\\n \"You might try the Zipfer,\" his brother suggested, the traitorous fuck. \"You can drink quite a bit and it doesn\u0027t cause hangovers.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Teal snapped, \"because I\u0027m gonna drink alot . Bring on the Zips,\" he told the waiter, who smiled and walked away.\\n\\n \"Ugh, beer,\" Jenny said, wrinkling her nose.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just so…\" His fag brother groped for the word.\\n\\n \"Common,\" Jenny prompted.\\n\\n \"Exactly. Now a solid, oaked white, on the other hand…\"\\n\\n \"You could hardly call it common.\"\\n\\n \"When the wine comes,\" he informed Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dummer, \"I\u0027m cutting the cork in half and sticking each piece in my ear. It\u0027s an alternative to slitting both your throats.\"\\n\\n \"Now you\u0027re just being a baby,\" Jenny said reproachfully. \"You should be happy I find your brother so—ah—engaging.\"\\n\\n \"Not if it means I\u0027m going to be bored out of my tits all night,\" he snapped back.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe I almost…\" She shut up and sipped from her water glass.\\n\\n \"Believe me, \u0027narrow escape\u0027 is the phrase that\u0027s been on my mind all evening, too.\" He gulped his water thirstily… where was the Zipper beer? He needed about ten.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m delighted you find me engaging,\" his brother said, and Jenny blushed to her eyebrows. \"And speaking of engaging, I don\u0027t think we should delay even a moment.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I agree,\" Jenny said, blinking up at him with her big Shania Twain eyes. \"I think, if you find that person, that certain someone—I despise the term soul mate because it\u0027s—it\u0027s—\"\\n\\n \"So dreadfully overused.\"\\n\\n \"Yes! But when you do find such a creature, someone so in sync, there seems no point to delay.\"\\n\\n \"I agree.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so happy to hear that!\"\\n\\n \"Not as happy as I am, Jenny.\" They hugged briefly, and Teal barely rescued their water glasses.\\n\\n \"What the hell is this?\" he asked.\\n\\n They untangled each other, each beaming at him like pod people. \"Congratulate us, dear,\" Jenny said.\\n\\n \"Congratulate you forwhat ? Macking at the table in the most expensive restaurant in the state?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, give us all your best wishes,\" his weirdo brother added, still holding Jenny\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"You guys. Seriously. What the hell is going on?\"\\n\\n They stared deeply into each other\u0027s eyes, and Teal was about to repeat the question, louder, when they turned to him and said in unison, \"We\u0027re engaged!\"\\n\\n In fact, you can get a hangover if you drink too many Zipfer beers.\\n\\n Chapter 38\\n\\n Alex was cuddled in Shel\u0027s arms and it was, at the moment, difficult to feel concerned about anything. Instead, she actually felt sleepy. Not the exhaustion of knowing she hadn\u0027t slept enough and wouldn\u0027t in the future, but actual \"it\u0027s possible to doze off\" sleepy.\\n\\n \"That was yummy,\" she sighed, stroking her fingers along his bicep.\\n\\n \"The yummiest in my life. We keep topping each other.\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"Is that supposed to be a joke?\"\\n\\n \"No. Because if it was, it\u0027d be a pretty bad one, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"Do you want me to call room service, have them send up a steak?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be too tired to cut it.\"\\n\\n \"I could have someone cut it.\"\\n\\n He groaned. \"What a great way to shatter my post-coital bliss.\"\\n\\n \"Well, using the phrase \u0027post-coital\u0027 shatters mine.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027re even. Can you sleep? For a little while?\"\\n\\n \"I think. For a little while.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m staying. Don\u0027t freak out.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-22.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \\n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
