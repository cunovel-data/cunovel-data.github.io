Try to work that into your State of the Nation speech, as a personal favor to me.\"\n \"Stop messing with my head,\" he ordered. \"You think it\u0027s funny, the shock at my age? And tell me about this guy.\"\n \"It\u0027s the guy I already told you about—\"\n \"The annoying one?\"\n \"His name\u0027s Sheldon Rivers—\"\n \"Sheldon?\"\n \"Shut up, he\u0027s cool. Don\u0027t pretend you didn\u0027t read all about him in whatever dossier Edmund made for you.\"\n \"Yeah, well, skip to the highlights.\"\n \"He\u0027s the head of the aquarium out here—\"\n \"His name\u0027s Sheldon and he\u0027s a geek.\"\n \"His name\u0027s Sheldon and he\u0027s got a pair of shoulders like an Olympic swimmer.\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me this,\" the king groaned.\n \"I sweat just looking at him.\"\n \"Alex, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\n \"You know that song \u0027Big John\u0027? \u0027He stood six-foot-six and weighed two forty-five…\u0027 \"\n \"\u0027Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip,\u0027\" her father sang, \" \u0027everybody knew you didn\u0027t give no lip to Big John.\u0027 Honey, who do you think played that song for you all those years?\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m just saying. Sheldon\u0027s a big guy.\"\n \"For a marine weenie.\"\n \"You taken a look at your son lately? Taller than you, isn\u0027t he?\"\n \"Never mind,\" the king grumped. \"Let\u0027s get back to Shelly.\"\n \"Please promise to never call him that again.\"\n \"I\u0027m not promising shit. Besides, it\u0027s not like I\u0027m going to meet the guy, right?\"\n \"Right,\" she said firmly. No indeed. She had no intention of letting her North Dakota fling get within a hundred miles of the king.\n \"So you\u0027re, what? Dating him?\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"Yeah, but, where\u0027s it gonna go? I mean, he knows you\u0027re not going to be around much longer, right?\"\n \"It\u0027s not like that, Dad. We\u0027re just enjoying each other\u0027s company. He makes me laugh and I—well, I have no idea what he sees in me.\"\n \"Besides an unimaginable fortune and the chance to live in a palace.\"\n \"Trust me, that\u0027s not what it is.\"\n \"Then whatis it? On second thought,\" he ordered, \"don\u0027t answer that.\"\n She giggled. \"Don\u0027t worry. I love you, Dad, but some things will never be told.\"\n \"Well, I guess it\u0027s okay.\"\n \"Thank you sooooo much.\"\n \"As long as you don\u0027t enjoy it too much,\" her father said. \"And you can consider that a royal command.\"\n Too late, she thought, and wondered if that was smugness she felt, or something else.\n Chapter 19\n \"This is it?\" Shel asked.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"This is our big date?\"\n She almost laughed. \"Yes. Why? Do you want to go back?\"\n \"No. No, but when you said it was a surprise, and we did this mysterious long drive in a fancy RV—I mean, a family of ten could live in this place—I guess—I guess I wasn\u0027t expecting—\"\n There was a rap on their sitting room door, and Jenny poked her head in. \"Ready to go ice fishing?\" she asked cheerfully, her nose adorably red from the cold.\n \"This isn\u0027t ice fishing,\" Shel decided, following the women off the vehicle. He looked around to the small team of men and women setting up drills, equipment (depth monitors and at least one fish finder), and tables of snacks. \"This is a party at the Ritz.\"\n Alex watched indulgently as one of her guards scooped ice chips out of the most recently drilled hole (there were four altogether), and another one plunked her baited line into it, then carefully propped the rod in the snow so it wouldn\u0027t fall over. Jenny handed her a steaming cup of cocoa laced with Godiva white chocolate liqueur and she sighed.\n \"School coming,\" someone announced, gaze glued to the fish finder.\n \"Very well,\" she replied. Then, to Shel, \"It\u0027s not? What else would it be? How doyou go ice fishing?\"\n He waved his arms around and, in his dark brown parka and matching snowpants, looked like an irked koala. \"Not like this! Not with fifty people driving me and drilling my hole and giving me snacks!\"\n \"But it\u0027s so nice this way,\" Alex pointed out, and took a sip. \"Mmm… Godiva up this drink a little more, will you, Jenn? Look, if you don\u0027t like it, go back into the RV and have a nap.\"\n \"I\u0027m not… never mind. Whereare we, anyway?\"\n \"Manitoba. It\u0027s a little too far into spring in Minot to do this safely,\" she said, gesturing to all the vehicles parked on the ice. She grinned at him. \"Don\u0027t pretend you minded the drive.\"\n \"It\u0027s not the drive that\u0027s weirding me out. It\u0027s—\"\n \"Your Highness, you\u0027ve got a bite.\"\n \"It\u0027s that!\" Shel nearly shouted, watching another staff member crouch over the hole, gently pick up the rod, set the hook, and pull a wriggling, thirteen-inch Northern Pike onto the ice. \"That! That is not ice fishing! That is watching someone fish! I might as well be watching this on TV!\"\n \"Dr. Rivers has a bite,\" someone else announced.\n \"The hell I do! And I\u0027m not landing it, either!\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" Jenny said cheerfully, trying to hand him a cup of coffee. \"We\u0027ll take care of it.\"\n \"Another pike,\" one of the guides said, pulling the addled fish onto the ice. \"A little too small; we\u0027ll unhook this feller and put him back. And the princess has another bite.\"\n \"We\u0027re in the school,\" the gal with her face in the monitor announced, unnecessarily.\n \"Nice fish,\" Reynolds, the guard, told him.\n \"It\u0027s not my fish! And it was just a baby.\"\n \"You\u0027ll get another one,\" Alex said, comforting him.\n \"No I won\u0027t! Aren\u0027t you listening?\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to listen when you do all that shouting. I thought you\u0027d like this. I thought this would be right up your alley,\" she complained. \"God knows standing around freezing my ass off isn\u0027t my idea of a fun afternoon.\"\n \"How can being waited on hand and toe not be your idea of a fun afternoon? You\u0027re not even cold!\"\n \"Dr. Rivers has another bite.\"\n \"No! I! Don\u0027t!\" They were all staring at him as he shrieked. Fearing he might pop an aneurysm, he stomped up the steps into the waiting RV.\n \"Well!\" Alex said brightly, shrugging out of her outer winter clothes and dismissing Jenny with a wave of her hand. \"That was quite a show you put on this afternoon.\"\n \"Look, we just have different ideas about ice fishing, that\u0027s all. I was… surprised. Uh, pleasantly surprised.\"\n \"Mmm-hmm. I suppose your idea of fun is to crouch, shivering, over a hole it took you an hour to dig with substandard equipment, and no snacks, and no shelter if the wind picks up, and nothing to tell you if the fish are anywhere around.\"\n \"I can\u0027t help it,\" he bragged, \"if I fish like a man.\"\n She laughed at him and rubbed her eyes at the same time. \"Well, I\u0027m glad to be back at the hotel at least. God, I miss my bed.\"\n \"Are you all right?\"\n \"Why, do I look like hell?\"\n \"You look a little…\" Sheldon was studying her with a gaze as alarming as it was penetrating. \"Hollow-eyed.\"\n \"I was up all night talking to my dad. And then, of course, there was the fun-filled afternoon with Dr. Grumpy.\"\n \"Oh yeah? He calls you?\"\n \"When I\u0027m on the road. He\u0027s kind of a mother hen.\"\n \"The King of Alaska? I\u0027ve seen pictures. The phrase \u0027mother hen\u0027 doesn\u0027t exactly leap to my mind. I mean, he\u0027s got fists the size of coconuts! That\u0027s just a scary, scary thought.\"\n \"Well, you know. He worries. It\u0027s been just him since my mother died, and I was just a kid when that happened, so…\" She trailed off. Where was she going with that? It was hard to keep hold of a thought. She estimated she had slept ten hours in the last one hundred and twenty. It was easier to sleep when she knew Dara was safe, from—from—Her tired mind groped, lost it, tried again, gave up. \"So it\u0027s just us. I mean, us and my brothers and my sister. He bugs them, too.\"\n \"Uh-huh. I have this keen idea.\"\n \"Keen?\" She smiled a little. \"Jeepers, Dr. Rivers, I can\u0027t wait to hear all about your nifty plan.\"\n \"You\u0027re so grouchy when you\u0027re tired. And my keen plan is this: let\u0027s bag dinner and take a nap instead.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" she said, walking over to the mirror on the wall. \"I got my fifteen minutes this afternoon. Good God, I look embalmed.\"\n He laughed, came up behind her, and put his hands on her shoulders. She leaned back, enjoying the feel of him, the smell. \"Princess, on your worst day you look like a movie star on her best.\"\n \"Dark circles and all.\"\n \"They\u0027re sexy.\"\n \"So\u0027s foot fungus.\"\n \"Uh, no.\"\n \"You know what I like about you?\" she asked his reflection in the mirror.\n \"My wit, my sparkling personality? My gigantic cock?\"\n \"None of those.\"\n \"Well, shit.\"\n \"I like that you\u0027re not trying to impress me all the time. I mean, look what you\u0027re wearing. Dockers, and no socks! Most people in a private meeting with royalty would put on socks, at least.\"\n \"They\u0027re all in the wash, along with most of my underpants. Come on.\" He took her by the hand and pulled her into the bedroom.\n \"Well, finally. I didn\u0027t think we were ever going to get down to it.\"\n \"For an untouchable royal princess, you\u0027ve got a shocking one-track mind. Lie down.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-12.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
