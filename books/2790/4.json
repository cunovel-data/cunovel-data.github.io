Put on some Stones.\" \"Not even if you threatened to cut off my hands,\" Jenny said, showing some backbone for a change. \"That\u0027s more like it,\" Christina said approvingly. \"Everybody\u0027s gotta relax around here. That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying.\" Alex wanted to say something bitchy yet cutting like \"the Alaskan royal family got along fine before you got here\" but, of course, that wasn\u0027t exactly true. Instead, she held up her empty dessert plate. Instantly, a footman—footwoman, rather—took it from her. What was her name? Something that rhymed with Harry. Mary? Terry? No… it was so hard to remember the new ones… \"Thank you, Carrie.\" \"You\u0027re welcome, Your Highness. Something else?\" \"No, that\u0027s fine. Maybe a little more to drink.\" She and Chris were enjoying an early lunch; the rest of the family was out and about on various official duties. Alex knew she wouldn\u0027t get rid of Christina for a bit; her sister-in-law was deep in Concern Mode. \"Where\u0027s Dara?\" she asked, changing the subject and smiling a thank-you as her glass of milk was refilled by another footman. \"With her dad in the penguin room. I guess they\u0027re keeping an eye on a nest and it\u0027s supposed to explode or hatch or whatever any second. It\u0027s hard work, getting fish guts out of a toddler\u0027s hair.\" Alex grinned. \"Thankfully your problem, not mine. She slept late this morning.\" \"Yeah…\" Christina\u0027s hazel eyes were narrow and she was chewing on her lower lip. Her blond hair, recently cut to ear-length, was typically disheveled and she wore her usual outfit of jeans and a white work shirt, no socks, beat-up loafers. Other than the grooms, she was the most casually dressed person on palace grounds \"Yeah, that\u0027s—I\u0027m not gonna be distracted, by the way. Listen, not that I\u0027m complaining, but don\u0027t you think this sort of—of errand or whatever—would be a better job for David?\" Her oldest brother, the Crown Prince, was also Dr. Baranov, with a doctorate in marine biology. Christina was irritating, but right. Which, of course, only made her more irritating. \"Yes.\" \"Well, how come the king didn\u0027t ask him to go?\" Alex almost didn\u0027t answer. Jenny, who was sitting at the other end of the table to do paperwork (Baranov family protocol was a great deal looser than, say, Windsor family protocol) instantly looked twice as absorbed. Her posture gave offNo, I\u0027m not hearing a word, not a single word, don\u0027t give me a thought vibrations, in the manner of skilled officials the world over. Alex looked at the top of Jenny\u0027s dark head for a long moment, thoughtfully tapped her fruit knife on the edge of the plate, then said, \"Because David has a happy, fulfilled, wonderful life and he doesn\u0027t want to leave it. Doesn\u0027t need to leave it. It was hard enough for him to agree to the Geneva thing, and that\u0027s only going to be for three days.\" Christina paused in mid-chew, gulped audibly, then forced down the strawberry. \"Well, okay.\" She coughed. \"I mean… that\u0027s okay. Maybe this… maybe you\u0027ll like it.\" \"Maybe.\" Then, \"Jenny, will you let Stacy know I\u0027m going to want to talk about wardrobe issues?\" \"At once, Highness. And you have a press conference in thirty minutes.\" \"Very well.\" Jenny rose in a graceful rustle of silk and linen, scooped up her paperwork, bowed her head for a moment, and hurried out. She left behind the faintest scent of lilacs. \"Ick,\" Chris commented, glancing down at her practical clothing. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re going. But I have to say, that\u0027s like death to me, the whole thing. Wardrobe meetings, protocol meetings, itinerary meetings, babbling about same to reporters, who actuallywrite about it…\" Alex smoothed the lapel of her navy blue Travis Avers jacket. Christina\u0027s complaints on the subject were nothing new, though they somewhat mystified Alex. Meetings and the press and itineraries were a part of everyday life. Nothing was free… not even when your father\u0027s picture was on all the money. \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re so cute.\" \"Don\u0027t start,Princess Alex.\" She laughed. \"I won\u0027t if you won\u0027t, darling plebian sister-in-law.\" \"Snob.\" \"Nag.\" \"Egotist.\" \"Busybody.\" \"Stuck up.\" \"I\u0027ll miss our lunches.\" \"Oh, Alex.\" Christina\u0027s eyes seemed to well for a second and, in an oddly tender moment, she leaned forward and kissed the top of Alex\u0027s head. \"Sleep.\" \"Not now, of course. There\u0027s too much work to do.\" Christina only sighed. Chapter 5 \"Right, right. So, she\u0027s going off to Arizona or wherever—\" \"North Dakota, Your Majesty.\" Edmund, standing at attention three feet to the king\u0027s left, looked as if he had been born of starch. He was as tall as the king, but much thinner—\"have a milkshake for God\u0027s sake\" thin. His black hair was swept back from his face, which was noble, almost—was it possible?—kingly. Large eyes, strong nose, strong chin… many times, Edmund had been mistaken for a member of the royal family. He had been taking care of the Baranovs for decades. \"But you were very close.\" Christina kept pacing. The reigning king of Alaska, Alexander Baranov II, stayed seated at his desk, working on his word finds. Late afternoon sunlight spilled into the office from the large bay of windows on the left, gifting everything—desk, paperwork, floor, Christina\u0027s profile, Edmund\u0027s nose—with a golden hue. \"Right, North Dakota. That was my second guess. Well, the winters won\u0027t be much of a change for her.\" \"It\u0027s spring, Sir.\" \"Yeah, whatever,\" Christina muttered. \"So Alex goes and—what? Everything works out great and she forgives herself?\" King Al looked up and said, almost sharply, \"She doesn\u0027t have to forgive shit. She did the right thing. She was my brave girl and if she hadn\u0027t kicked that guy\u0027s ass—\" \"Devon\u0027s ass, Your Majesty.\" \"Right, Devon. You\u0027d think I\u0027d be able to remember his name, but it\u0027s just one of those things that never stick in my head. Anyway, I would have—\" \"Kicked his ass from your coma,\" Christina sneered, \"sure.\" \"Well, I would have. Watch your mouth, miss. One of the three of us in this room is in charge, and it ain\u0027t you.\" Edmund cleared his throat modestly. Christina adopted a more conciliatory tone, an amazing feat no one but the king or her husband could bring about. \"Look, I\u0027m not saying she did anything wrong,you\u0027re not saying she did anything wrong,Congress isn\u0027t saying she did anything wrong. But obviously she thinks—well, she thinkssomething , or she\u0027d be able to sleep and eat and she wouldn\u0027t jump every time somebody picked up a pen. I mean, come on. That\u0027s not normal. Freaking out when your brother—your chronically late brother—is late, that\u0027s not normal, right?\" \"For Princess Alexandria, no. It\u0027s not normal.\" \"I didn\u0027t know her for very long before Devon did his little \u0027time to kill the king and take over the country\u0027 shtick, but she just—I mean,look at her. You can hardly tell she\u0027s pretty.\" \"An exaggeration, with all respect,\" Edmund said. \"The princess is beautiful every moment.\" \"Not when she\u0027s staggering down the hallway at two thirty in the morning,\" Christina shot back. \"I don\u0027t carehow great-looking she is, nobody looks good at that place and time. And you know why nobody noticed she was gonna faint? Because her normal skin color is \u0027about to faint\u0027 pale.\" The king chewed on his thumbnail for a moment. He was an older, male version of Princess Alex, with the trademark Baranov blue eyes, black hair, and quick mind. His fists were the size of bowling balls, dwarfed only by his heart and generosity. \"What does Dr. Pohl say about it?\" he asked, slowly circling EMBARRASSMENT. \"She\u0027s gotta have some ideas.\" \"Oh, she\u0027s like a clam. All that patient-client whatever-it-is.\" \"Privilege, Your Highness.\" \"Right. Like she said this weekend. Anyway, she\u0027s not talking. Not even under extreme nagging. And I bet Alex isn\u0027t talking, either. Not to Dr. Pohl, not to us.\" \"Characteristic,\" Edmund suggested. \"Annoying,\" King Al and Christina said in unison. \"So, she\u0027ll go. She seems like she wants to go… right? Chris, she say anything like she didn\u0027t want to go?\" \"No, she\u0027s already signed off on her outfit lists and all that junk. She\u0027s got meetings scheduled and everybody\u0027s almost good to go. It\u0027s like she came to lunch with her mind made up.\" \"Well, then.\" The king circled ASSESSMENT. \"Change of scenery, right? Kid might get a kick out of it. Might get some sleep.\" \"I guess slipping something into her food is totally out of the question.\" \"Yeah, plus it\u0027s against the law to do that to a member of the royal family.\" \"Also,\" Edmund prompted, \"it\u0027s morally wrong and no way to solve a chronic problem.\" \"Right,\" Al and Chris said with convincing sincerity. \"When\u0027s she leave? It\u0027s on one of my schedules around here…\" The king gestured to the hundreds of pages in neat piles around his work space. \"Along with the grand opening of the new salmon farm.\" \"The day after tomorrow, Your Majesty.\" \"Tell her I\u0027d like to have a meeting with her before she takes off. Clear my schedule for tomorrow morning and we\u0027ll get it done.\" \"I\u0027ll see to it at once, Sir.\" \"Al, how many times do we have to talk about this? You don\u0027t have meetings with your kid.\" \"Haven\u0027t seen her in a couple of days,\" the king said absently, circling ABASEMENT. \"It\u0027s a big place. If I don\u0027t catch her now, I gotta catch her later. And I got stuff later.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-4.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
