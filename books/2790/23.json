Truth .\\n\\n \"Just let her sleep, Jenny, will you for Christ\u0027s sake let her sleep?\"\\n\\n \"But she might be sick!\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not sick, she\u0027s tired, you get tired, right?\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Rivers, will you please let me past before I get Mr. Krenklov and his Sig Sauer in here?\"\\n\\n \"Keep your voice down!\"\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake!\" Alex said, opening her eyes and sitting up. \"I can\u0027t believe you two woke me up! Whatis it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s ten o\u0027clock in the morning, Princess,\" Jenny hollered over Shel\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"Go back to sleep,\" Shel ordered.\\n\\n Alex could see he was planted squarely in the doorway, and Jenny had to jump up to see into the room. She looked like an agitated, well-clad rabbit. \"You\u0027ve missed your first two appointments.\"\\n\\n \"It isnot …\" She blinked. Yes, that was sunlight. A lot of it. Sunlight.Morning . \"Oh my God, I slept all night? And didn\u0027t…\" She shut her mouth, though why she bothered she had no idea. Jenny certainly knew about the nightmares—there were no secrets in the Sitka palace, or at least not very many. And of course Shel knew. \"Why—why didn\u0027t you wake me?\"\\n\\n Shel looked over his shoulder and quirked an eyebrow at her. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\\n\\n She flung the covers back and jumped out of bed. \"Come in here and shut the door. Both of you. Oh my God. I\u0027ve missed appointments!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that sound you heard was the worldnot coming to an end,\" Shel snarked.\\n\\n She ignored him, frantic, \"Jenn, help me. Where\u0027s the yellow Donna Karan?\"\\n\\n \"I have it right here. If Dr. Rivers will excuse us, we\u0027ll get you ready.\"\\n\\n \"I have to go,\" she said, rushing to him and giving him a distracted kiss as Jenny went to the closet for the shoes that matched the Karan. \"I mean, I have to stay, but other people have to come up. I\u0027m sorry. See you tonight?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\" He grinned. \"At least put some underpants on before you start your first meet \u0027n\u0027 greet.\"\\n\\n She looked down at herself. \"Good advice.\"\\n\\n Chapter 39\\n\\n \"… and tomorrow the king insisted you take the day off, so there really isn\u0027t anything on the schedule.\"\\n\\n Ican\u0027t believe I slept all night. In his arms, like some fairy tale princess. Which I certainly am not. No guns in fairy tales .\\n\\n \"And then, of course, we\u0027ll be test driving Ferraris and driving them off cliffs, … la Thelma and Louise.\"\\n\\n And he was so great about it. He\u0027s been great about everything. He\u0027s so nice to me and he doesn\u0027t give a holy old crap about the money or the title or any of it. He didn\u0027t even want me to pay for his meal! He never wants me to pay for anything.\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll have sex change operations, and you will be Alan, and I\u0027ll be Jon.\"\\n\\n \"If I\u0027m going to be a man, my name will be Fred, and very funny, Jenny. I heard everything you said.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you got too much sleep,\" she suggested slyly.\\n\\n \"Boy, that was weird, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n a ¯\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, Princess. If we\u0027re finished here, I can—\"\\n\\n \"No, come on, let\u0027s hear it.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" Jenny shifted her weight; she had clearly been ready to get up from the small table, and now had to stay put. \"I think part of your… difficulties… stem from being unable to give up control. But once you do that, you can relax.\"\\n\\n Alex sniffed. \"I don\u0027t think psychology is your field.\"\\n\\n \"No, but it certainly could be.\"\\n\\n She bit her tongue so she wouldn\u0027t say something nastier. Of course, Jenny was wrong. It wasn\u0027t that cut-and-dried… what was? Oh, so she let Shel tie her up and fuck her and that\u0027s how she could come? Because it was all out of her control? And so was Shel? And once she gave up enough control she could sleep? How completely, totally, utterly ridiculous.\\n\\n \"Dr. Rivers has called,\" Jenny said, apropos of nothing. \"He\u0027ll be here within the next thirty minutes.\"\\n\\n \"I—that\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n \"And the king will see you for breakfast tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Where is he now?\"\\n\\n \"Fishing with some locals.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. Should have guessed. Did he put on one of those dumb beards to disguise himself?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see him leave, Princess, but I would bet my clothing budget that you\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t want me to doanything tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"Apparently not, Your Highness.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s weird, don\u0027t you think?\"\\n\\n \"That you should have a day off? Highness, look who you\u0027re asking.\"\\n\\n She laughed again. \"Good point. Sorry. I don\u0027t suppose I could talk you into taking tomorrow off, too.\"\\n\\n \"Well… if you want me to…\"\\n\\n She blinked. What had Jenny just said? Was the universe about to implode as well? \"You want tomorrow off?\"\\n\\n \"No, no. Of course not. But then, if you don\u0027t think you\u0027llneed me …\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God! You\u0027re into Teal Grange!You\u0027re intoTeal Grange .\" Talk about opposites attract! Not that she was in any position to judge. \"That\u0027s great! Good for you. Of course, take tomorrow off, take my credit card, have a party.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not Teal.\"\\n\\n Whoa. She blinked. \"Jenny, you\u0027re shockingly quick. We\u0027ve been here, what? Less than two weeks? And you\u0027ve got how many men on the string?\"\\n\\n \"Not at all. His brother is in town. His identical twin, violin playing, doctorate at Berkeley brother.\" Jenny cupped her chin in her hands and sighed. \"Ohhhhhh, his brother.\"\\n\\n Alex stared for a moment, then recovered herself. \"Well, that\u0027s great. That\u0027s—I mean, Teal\u0027s a great guy, but you guys didn\u0027t strike me as—I mean—have fun tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"And you might as well know, Highness, I\u0027ll need some time off for the wedding.\"\\n\\n So completely taken by surprise at the conversation, Alex didn\u0027t immediately follow. \"You mean the invitation came? Elizabeth unbent?\"\\n\\n \"No. My wedding.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve known this guy since…\"\\n\\n \"Last night. We decided, after a 1947 Bordeaux, that we were going to be together forever.\" At the princess\u0027s flabbergasted expression, Jenny added, \"Teal had a Zipfer.\"\\n\\n \"Jenny, whoa, put the brakes on! Are you sure you know what you\u0027re doing?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"No, really.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, really, Your Highness.\"\\n\\n \"But you barely know the guy!\"\\n\\n \"I know. Isn\u0027t it silly? But when you know, that\u0027s all there is.\" Jenny stacked some papers together and gave her boss a penetrating look. \"There\u0027s no use fooling myself.\"\\n\\n \"Well… have a good day tomorrow… maybe you can bring him up. I\u0027d love to meet him.\"\\n\\n \"Which reminds me, I must meet with the king. I have a first violin player ready to come help put together a Juneau orchestra. I would be grateful for any support you feel you can give us.\"\\n\\n \"Of—of course. I\u0027ll talk to Dad. He\u0027s always bitching because there\u0027s not enough culture in Juneau. Like he\u0027d make it through a symphony without snoring.\"\\n\\n \"And your call to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth will be going through in…\" Jenny glanced at her watch. \"Four minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Great. Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see Dr. Rivers up when he arrives.\"\\n\\n \"Great. Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Princess, are you all right?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, fine. There\u0027s just… a lot going on right now.\"\\n\\n \"Yes indeed,\" Jenny said cheerfully, and excused herself.\\n\\n Chapter 40\\n\\n \"It\u0027s very good to hear from you, Alex. How is your dear niece?\"\\n\\n \"Dara\u0027s great, Queen Elizabeth, thank you for asking. And thank you for speaking with me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my pleasure, dear. How may I help you?\"\\n\\n \"Well… I wanted to congratulate you on William\u0027s upcoming wedding.\"\\n\\n \"Alovely girl.\" Pronounced, in the way of the upper British class, \"gull.\" \"An impeccable family. And she loves dogs; she has six of her own. Six!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, she sounds wonderful. I—ah—I was wondering—I don\u0027t want to seem forward, but it seems like our invitation has been lost in the, uh, mail.\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Alex plunged ahead. \"And in case you were waiting for RSVPs, I didn\u0027t want you to think we weren\u0027t. RSVPing, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" the queen managed.\\n\\n \"Because, unfortunately, I wanted to tell you that I\u0027m afraid my family—not asingle member of my family—can make it to Will\u0027s wedding. And I beg you not to be offended, and I apologize on behalf of the Baranovs.\"\\n\\n \"You—your father can\u0027t—you won\u0027t be able to come?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid not, Your Majesty.\"\\n\\n \"Oh! That—that\u0027s unfortunate, dear. William will be so disappointed. I had been, ah, looking forward to introducing you all at the blessing.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe at Harry\u0027s wedding.\"\\n\\n The queen laughed. \"Bite your tongue, darling! I\u0027m sorry about the invitation; I\u0027ll be sure to send another one round at once. These mails! Dreadful!\"\\n\\n \"Really dreadful,\" Alex agreed, sprawling with relief in her chair. \"Thank you again for taking my call.\"\\n\\n \"Say hello to King Alexander for me, darling. And you take care, too. May I say, and I hope you don\u0027t find me forward, but may I say I thought you looked after him splendidly after that nasty business last year.\" Naw-stee business lahst yeah. \"A parent prays for a daughter like you, dear, and I hope your father appreciates what a gem you are.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she managed. What an odd thing for the queen to say, and how happy it made her feel. \"Thank you so much, Queen Elizabeth. I—I look after him as best I can.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-23.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \\n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
