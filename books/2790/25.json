That he whispered her name in the dark and ate all the peas on her plate. That he resented his father and revered his mother. That he hated being the new kid when he was in school. That he thought she was beautiful and smart and sexy. That he wanted to be with her. That he hated not spending the night.\n With her. Only with her.\n She took a breath. \"Are you really telling me you\u0027re going to move? Again? You want the happily ever after? You want to uproot, change everything, move to Alaska of all places, where you\u0027ll be rich—PrinceSheldon—and your son will be a prince, and all your grandchildren?\"\n He opened his mouth, and she could instantly see he had never thought of it in those terms. He\u0027d been so focused on having her, he\u0027d never considered the fact that he\u0027d have to give up everything to do it.\n \"I didn\u0027t think so,\" she said triumphantly, and then started to cry. \"Don\u0027t you dare!\" she shouted when he took a hesitant step forward. \"You get your pants on and get out of here!\"\n \"Is that a royal command?\" he asked hoarsely, pale as the sheets.\n \"Take it however you want. Just get out.\"\n \"Fine, Princess. Nice fucking you.\"\n \"Lovemaking!\" she yelled as he hopped out the door, struggling to get his right leg into his left pant leg. \"It was lovemaking, and don\u0027t you ever forget it!\"\n Chapter 44\n She\u0027d broken the last lamp when the gentle tapping became insistent pounding. \"Get lost!\" she yelled, kicking one of the delicate side tables into the wall. \"No visitors, Jenny, I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s the new Pope!\"\n \"How about the king of Alaska?\" a familiar voice said through the door.\n \"Not now, Dad!\" She booted another table.\n \"Aw, come on, honey, you\u0027re costing me a fortune in there.\"\n \"Take it out of one of my trust funds!\"\n \"Open this door.\"\n She tried to make her mouth say \"go away,\" but her training and background were too strong. She could no more ignore an order from her father—or the king—than she could attend a press conference without a shirt.\n She trudged to the door and opened it, then waded through the detritus her rage had made and flopped facedown on the bed.\n \"Jee-zus,\" her father whistled, tripping over a broken lamp. \"It looks like Guns N\u0027 Roses were in here with you.\"\n \"You\u0027re dating yourself, Dad. They broke up. It\u0027s the way of the world: desertion and despair.\"\n \"What?\"\n She rolled over so she was no longer mumbling into her pillow. \"What can I do for you, my king?\"\n \"Uh… live happily ever after?\"\n \"I was thinking more a short-term project.\"\n \"How about getting something on besides that robe? It\u0027s almost noon. You can have lunch with your old man.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got a plane to catch.\"\n \"Yeah, uh, about that… I guess the boy isn\u0027t coming with you?\"\n \"Not hardly.\"\n \"Too bad.\"\n \"Dad. You hated him.\"\n \"No, I admired the shit out of him. But I covered it up real good,\" he bragged. He picked up an intact chair and set it beside the bed, then plopped into it. \"How many times are you gonna meet someone who likes you—\"\n \"For who I am, not what I have, blah-blah.\"\n \"No, I meant, likes youdespite who you are.\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s a nice thing to say,\" she snapped.\n \"You want nice? Get Jenny in here, she\u0027ll fill you up with it. I\u0027m a truth guy.\"\n \"Says the man who sneaks on fishing boats in disguise.\"\n \"That\u0027s because I have a hard time finding people who like me for who I am,\" he said bluntly, \"and do you get where I\u0027m going with this, or do I haveta get Edmund in here with the crayons?\"\n \"God, not Edmund, too. I couldn\u0027t face both of you.\"\n \"In that case, good luck,\" her father said quietly, \"looking in the mirror.\"\n \"What, Dad, what?\" She propped herself up on her elbows. \"You\u0027re saying I should tell him I love him and whisk him away to Alaska?\"\n \"Well—\"\n \"First of all, he won\u0027t go. Second, if he did go, he\u0027d never let his kids be, as he puts it, \u0027rich assholes.\u0027 And I\u0027ll never give up my family duties. Never.\"\n \"No,\" he said quietly. \"I wouldn\u0027t expect you to. And maybe the boy doesn\u0027t, either.\"\n \"It was stupid, stupid, stupid. I never meant for this to happen. I should never have—\" She closed her mouth.\n \"Alex, sometimes this stuff… it\u0027s beyond your control. But that doesn\u0027t make it a bad thing.\"\n \"Dad, beyond my control is the very definition of bad.\"\n \"Come on. Anybody who can brain a traitor and knock him out with one swing can adjust to change. I mean, Jesus. It\u0027s not like self-defense and attempted regicide was on the schedule that day,\" the king joked.\n She stared at him. \"It\u0027s not funny, Dad.\"\n \"Well. It\u0027s a little funny.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Jeez, kid, is that what this is about? Because you like everything on the schedule, all the time? How\u0027d you get to twenty-three—\"\n \"Twenty-five.\"\n \"—without realizing some stuff will never, ever be planned?\"\n She opened her mouth, and nothing came out.\n \"See, that\u0027s why I\u0027m the smart one,\" he said smugly.\n \"You are not. It goes me, David, Kathryn, Nicky, Alexander, and you.\"\n \"Like hell! Punks.\"\n \"And things can be planned,\" she insisted. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be chaotic.\"\n \"It\u0027s my fault,\" the king decided. \"It\u0027s no way to bring up a kid.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be an idiot.\"\n \"Wave and smile and sign this and break the champagne bottle on that, and at eight-oh-two we\u0027ll have cheese omelets with the American President, and at nine-oh-seven we\u0027ll visit the new elementary school named after your mother…\"\n \"Dad, come on. It\u0027s how it is. Your childhood was like that, and so was Grandpa\u0027s. You know the upside—we never have to worry about paying the electric bill, never in our lives.\"\n \"Alex, you get that you didn\u0027t do anything wrong that day, right?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I mean,really get it? Because you were a good girl and a patriot, too, and that coward got what he deserved, and if you hadn\u0027t done it, your brother would have.\"\n \"Which one?\"\n \"Either. Listen, Dr. Pohl told me—\"\n \"Nothing, I assume, due to doctor-patient privilege.\"\n \"It was a hypothetical.\"\n \"Oh, hypothetical. My ass.\"\n \"Anyway, she says, even though you didn\u0027t have to face any consequences—like being arrested or what-have-you—she says that doesn\u0027t mean there weren\u0027t any consequences at all.\"\n \"I might have heard something like that,\" she admitted. \"But how did we get on this topic? You were lecturing me on my love life a minute ago.\"\n \"Sweetie, if you haven\u0027t figured out how it\u0027s all related, than you\u0027re not the smart one. At all.\"\n \"We were talking about how I was stupid to let Shel get away,\" she said in a monotone.\n \"I didn\u0027t use the word stupid. And you\u0027ve got to stop punishing yourself for what happened last year. Look what it\u0027s costing you! Insomnia was bad enough, the dreams were bad enough, not being able to let an hour go by without checking on the baby was bad enough.\"\n \"Dad—\"\n \"Now you\u0027re running away, and for what? So you can go back to bad dreams and worrying about the next assassination attempt? Bullshitting Dr. Pohl because you know what the problem is, you just can\u0027t face it?\"\n \"I can\u0027t handle this right now, Dad.\" She put a hand over her eyes. She hadn\u0027t cried in front of him since the hospital. Twice in one day? Both in front of men she wanted to impress? No no no. \"I really can\u0027t.\"\n \"Looks like you don\u0027t have to. Because you\u0027re on a plane, and the boy\u0027s staying put. Everything can go on the way it\u0027s supposed to. Safe and sane and scheduled.\"\n \"He won\u0027t come anyway, Dad. And I\u0027m not exactly in a job I can quit.\"\n \"No,\" he allowed, \"but did you ask him?\"\n \"He won\u0027t.\"\n \"Well, nothing to be done about it, then.\"\n She peeked at him from between her fingers. He looked deceptively innocent. \"That\u0027s right,\" she said. \"Nothing to be done.\"\n He pulled a piece of dental floss from his pocket and she rolled over, away from the horror. The final, complete horror, the official point of no return: the worst day of the year. Second worst of her life.\n Chapter 45\n \"Oh. My. God.\" Teal was gaping around Sheldon\u0027s lab. \"Who\u0027d you kill?\"\n \"Get lost,\" he suggested warmly.\n \"Oh, Sheldon,\" Crane said, gingerly crunching across broken glass. \"The soul of politeness, even in the depths of being dumped.\"\n \"Hey, hey! I dumped her. Hi, by the way.\"\n \"Big bro had this nutty idea that it\u0027d be nice to see you again,\" Teal said, jerking a thumb at his twin, who had an expression on his face as if he was smelling a room full of elephant droppings. \"I told him you\u0027d be an asshole about it, seeing as how Alex\u0027s plane left a while ago, but he\u0027s a moron. So here we are.\"\n \"It\u0027s nice to see you again,\" Shel sighed. He was lying prone in the corner, on a bed of equipment requisition paperwork. \"How\u0027s things going?\"\n \"Er, fine. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t get to meet the princess.\"\n \"It\u0027s overrated. How long you in town?\"\n \"Not long.\" Crane took off his glasses, pulled a small, gray cloth out of his breast pocket, polished them, then settled them back on his nose. \"I\u0027m moving to Alaska next week.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-25.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
