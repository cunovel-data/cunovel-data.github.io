He expected a protest, but all she said was, \"I\u0027ll have Jenny send out an updated press release.\"\n \"No way!\" the king hollered. \"You know what I\u0027ll lose in deposits if you change the date?\"\n \"You can\u0027t let them,\" Nicky said, \"just so they cando it . Yech!\"\n \"Shut up and finish your soup,\" Alex snapped.\n \"Your love life is yech.\n We must never speak of this\n Never in our lives.\"\n \"Alexander, I\u0027m serious. If you don\u0027t stop with that, and I meanright now …\" Kathryn brandished her empty soup bowl threateningly.\n \"That\u0027s amazing,\" Shel said. \"They just come out of you? That\u0027s haiku?\"\n \"You bet your ass it is,\" Prince Alexander said. \"Give me any topic and I\u0027ll give you a great fuckin\u0027 haiku.\"\n The king pointed his fruit fork at the prince. \"You just watch your mouth, boy. You\u0027re not too big to spank. Or imprison.\"\n \"It\u0027s really a nice announcement,\" Christina said. She glanced at the princess. \"You warned him, right? I mean, his pic\u0027s gonna be in all the magazines.\"\n \"I warned him.\"\n \"And the wedding coverage! You warned him he\u0027d be on TV, right?\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Shel said. \"Well, it\u0027s not, but it\u0027s worth putting up with.\"\n Alex beamed. \"I can\u0027t wait.\" She looked at her prince. \"I love you.\"\n \"I love you, too,\" he said, touched. It was the first time she\u0027d said it outside of the privacy of her rooms.\n It made ignoring the faux-barfing noises from the younger royals very easy.\n Chapter 50\n The Royal Household of Baranov, including His Majesty King Alexander II, announces the joyous occasion of the engagement of Her Highness, Princess Alexandria Baranov, to Dr. Sheldon Rivers, an American citizen.\n \"The wedding will take place at the Sitka Palace on Saturday, October 23rd, 2006, at 9:00 A.M. An expected eight thousand wedding invitations will be extended.\n \"The wedding will be held on the Sitka palace grounds and the reception will be on the West Lawn, weather permitting.\n \"All at the Sitka Palace wish life-long happiness to Her Highness the Princess of Alaska, and Dr. Rivers, future Prince of Alaska.\n \"After her wedding, Her Highness has announced her legal name and title will be Her Highness, Alexandria Baranov Rivers.\"\n Chapter 51\n One week later…\n Scott Gottlieb fussed around Dr. Pohl\u0027s desk for a minute, waiting for his boss to come in. She tended to sleep late, then work until ten o\u0027clock at night. That suited his schedule fine, as this job, cool as it was, was just a stopping point until he saved up enough to buy his own flower shop. He had the spot picked out: there was a lot just half a mile from the Sitka Palace, and one thing the Baranovs were famous for was convenience. If he could just get his shop set up there… he\u0027d have enough funding in another year, maybe two. And his old man had promised to help him with the down payment on the lot this summer…\n As Dr. Pohl\u0027s assistant, he got to see the business side of things and, even better, had hopes of spotting a royal. Although, Dr. Pohl usually went to the Sitka if she was supposed to see one of them… other than that time with Princess Christina, the Baranovs didn\u0027t come here, and why should they? Still, he had hopes…\n His boss came in, hung up her duck-patterned jacket (mergansers), and held out the tray of hot drinks she\u0027d grabbed from the local Starbucks. (She\u0027d threatened to strangle him with the cord to the shades if he ever brought her coffee, and he believed her.) She sat down behind her desk as he took his (white hot chocolate with a shot of espresso) and placed hers (coffee, no cream, two sugars) on the desk blotter.\n \"Hi, Scott.\"\n \"Morning, Dr. Pohl. The mail\u0027s here. And so\u0027s your ten o\u0027clock.\"\n \"That\u0027s \u0027Mrs. Johanssen,\u0027 Scott, they have names,\" she corrected him gently.\n He colored. \"Sorry, doc.\"\n \"Try not to do it again, please. I did see her on my way in, so just pop the mail in my bin and I\u0027ll get to it—\"\n \"Uh, excuse me, Doctor, but there\u0027s something in there I think you should—I mean, it\u0027s from the palace.\"\n \"Our palace?\" she asked, arching white eyebrows. She glanced over and there it was: a heavy, cream-colored envelope with the royal seal (a roaring lion holding a red shield) embossed on the back.\n Dr. Pohl picked it up, turned it over to see who it was from (HRH AB was the only hint she got), slit it open with her duck letter opener (a mallard), eased out the sheet of stationery, paper so heavy it had to have some cloth in it, and started to read.\n Scott pretended to straighten her files in the corner, then spun around when the doctor burst into tears.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" he gasped. \"Are you in trouble?\" He had visions of King Al\u0027s troops bursting in to drag the doctor away for… what? He had no idea.\n \"No,\" Dr. Pohl sobbed. \"I\u0027m going to be a bridesmaid.\"\n \"Please, please can I come with?\" he begged.\n \"No,\" Dr. Pohl said, still crying.\n Chapter 52\n Six months later…\n \"I can\u0027t believe this,\" Shel said. \"I can\u0027t fucking believe it.\"\n \"Yep,\" his future sister-in-law said cheerfully. \"The big day is finally here. I couldn\u0027t hardly sleep at all last night! Two royal weddings in two years! Too cool.\"\n He grunted and looked down at her, then looked away. Since the braces had come off and her acne had cleared up, Kathryn\u0027s promise of beauty had been fulfilled, and now she looked disturbingly like a shorter version of Alex. She was wearing what all the bridesmaids wore, a ridiculously full-skirted crimson gown with what had to be three hoop skirts—the skirt came out tohere . It was like something out ofGone with the Wind , a novel he loved mostly because all the rich people ended up poor.\n The crimson bodice was studded with small red beads, and Kathryn was wearing a matching bead choker around her neck and ruby dangling earrings.\n Her black hair was pinned up, showing the creamy perfection of her shoulders. If she was wearing shoes, Shel couldn\u0027t see them. Alex, his love, his bride, his (groan) princess, called them \"meringue dresses\" after a movie she had seen.\n Kathryn\u0027s bouquet, a striking cluster of deep red calla lilies held together with a wide crimson ribbon, was carelessly discarded in the corner while she fussed over Sheldon\u0027s already immaculate tie.\n \"You look really terrific,\" he told her. \"Really, uh, really beautiful.\"\n \"Well, finally,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve been waiting. You watch, I\u0027ll be the one having all the adventures next. I\u0027m tired of David and Chris and Alex hogging the spotlight.\"\n \"Your dad might have something to say about that… you\u0027re only, what? Sixteen?\"\n \"Oh.\" She dismissed the king of Alaska with a wave of her hand. \"He has something to say about everything.\"\n \"I just can\u0027t believe any of this,\" he said, looking around his small dressing room. He\u0027d spent most of his days in Minot, tying up loose ends and bringing the new head of the NDISL up to speed while he ducked the servants and guards. He\u0027d shooed away his man servants—paid friends? Butlers? Whatever the hell they were called. He was supposed to have, like, ten, and he didn\u0027t need any.\n \"Can\u0027t believe what?\" Kathryn asked.\n \"Huh? Oh, right. I can\u0027t believe we agreed to have an outdoor reception in October. In Alaska.\"\n \"Note the dresses,\" she said, pointing to her gigantic full skirt. \"This thing might as well be made of Goretex; I can\u0027t feel a thing. And all the guys have on long pants and long sleeves, and your tuxes are wool.\"\n \"I noticed,\" he said, tugging at his sleeve. But it was good wool; he didn\u0027t really itch. It was nerves. Awful, horrible, unending nerves. The tuxes were actually pretty nice… dark gray, with a stripe on each leg, but done well enough so that he didn\u0027t feel like a waiter.\n And Alex had insisted—no flower boutonnieres. Said they were tacky and everyone did them, which nearly caused a fistfight with Christina. Instead, the men were wearing inch-wide wreaths made of thyme. Although he had not been consulted (he\u0027d made clear he had no desire to plan any of it, except for one detail which Alex had readily agreed to, thank God) he liked them. Alex was right: in a wedding where tradition ruled, it was nice to see new things.\n \"And the sun is out!\" Kathryn was still babbling. \"It\u0027s going to be a gorgeous fall day. Nobody\u0027s gonna be cold.\"\n Then why was cold sweat trickling down his shoulder blades? Obviously, nothing to do with the weather…\n \"And don\u0027t forget,\" his future sister-in-law reminded him, \"you also promised my dad you wouldn\u0027t have sex until after you were married.\"\n \"Mind your own business,\" he said automatically, \"you little creep.\" Since his dick got hard, to paraphrase Eddie Murphy, when the wind blew, Shel needed no such reminding. The king had caught them at a weak moment, making them swear on their honor: no gropey until after the wedding-ey. And Alex, damn her Baranov sense of duty, had made them stick to it. Agh! It was the longest he\u0027d gone without sex in… er…\n \"So!\" Kathryn added, still straightening his tie, which was already perfectly straight, \"you must be really really glad today is here finally, huh?\"\n \"Actually, the time really, uh, flew.\" And it had. It had rushed up at him, like a wild animal free of its leash. It seemed like it had just been spring a week ago. Now he was about to be the Prince of Alaska. Because the only way to get the only woman in the world he wanted was to get a crown.\n A goddamned crown!\n \"Are you all right?\" Kathryn asked. \"You look kind of pukey.\"\n \"I feel kind of pukey,\" he admitted. \"I\u0027m going to walk around outside for a couple of minutes.\"\n She held his wrist and looked at his watch, a gift from the king. \"You\u0027ve got about twenty before you\u0027re supposed to be in South Juneau.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-28.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
