In fact, some of us sleep here if there\u0027s an experiment we don\u0027t want to leave.\"\\n\\n \"Do you do that in addition to taking care of the animals?\"\\n\\n \"We really don\u0027t need to spend much hands-on time with the animals; most of the feeding and such is handled by volunteers. One of the many purposes of the NDISL is research. For every one thing we know, there are hundreds of thousands of things—more likely millions—we don\u0027t know. Of course we have several on-staff biologists and veterinarians to keep an eye on the animals.\"\\n\\n \"How often do—\"\\n\\n Suddenly, one of the doors was yanked open—Alex had time to notice the stark black lettering (Dr. Sheldon Rivers, Director, Global Marine Programs) before someone (presumably Dr. Rivers) was standing in the doorway.\\n\\n \"Do you have to do this shit here?\" he snapped, oblivious to the three guns trained on him. \"You\u0027ve got the whole damn place—twelve thousand square feet!—and you have to have your meeting right outside my door?\"\\n\\n \"Shel,\" Dr. Tiegel began.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty sure I told you about the experiments I can\u0027t leave this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Shel, but—\"\\n\\n \"I mean, I have this memory of standing in your office and explaining why I couldn\u0027t play lapdog to her Royal Annoyingness, right?\"\\n\\n Dr. Tiegel winced and Jenny, who had been signaling the security team to put their guns away, suddenly stopped and looked as though she wished she had a gun of her own.\\n\\n As for Alex, she was having trouble looking away from the furious, infuriating Dr. Rivers. He was so tall and broad he filled the doorway, his cocoa-colored eyes were glaring at them from behind wire-rim frames, his lashes so long they nearly touched the glass. His long legs were showcased in shockingly tattered blue jeans and gaped at the waist; they were about two sizes too large. He was wearing a faded yellow T-shirt with the logo \"Marine Biologists Get Wet.\" No lab coat. His hair, light brown with sun-streaked highlights, stood up from his skull as if he\u0027d been running his fingers through it. His lips were almost too thin, set in a scowl that made his mouth disappear, and his eyes were creased with what might have been laugh lines, but were probably frown lines.\\n\\n \"Now get lost,\" he said, and shut the door.\\n\\n On Alex\u0027s foot.\\n\\n Chapter 7\\n\\n Shel Rivers looked down at the small foot wedged in his doorway, then up at the ridiculously good-looking woman attached to said foot. She didn\u0027t look mad or pissed or haughty. Just had a patient look on her face, like \"you\u0027re gonna get this thing off my foot, right?\" Finally, he said, \"That\u0027s a good way to break something,\" after a moment that felt longer than it was.\\n\\n \"Not before you get shot,\" she replied, and shouldered her way past him. A good trick, since he had, at best estimation, four inches and thirty pounds on her. He got a whiff of eucalyptus as she brushed by, and he almost reached out to see if her black, shoulder-length hair was as silky as it looked. \"Dr. Rivers and I will be right out,\" she added, and closed the door on the protests of everyone else in the party.\\n\\n The princess (princess! in his lab!) looked around the small, cluttered room for a moment, her small hands on shapely hips. Then she glanced back at him. He actually forgot to breathe when those crystal blue eyes fixed on his.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been properly introduced,\" she said pleasantly.\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t think your security team is going to like this at all.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Alexandria Baranov—\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m talking now, please. And you\u0027re Dr. Rivers. You\u0027re also rude and annoying, which is fine, butnobody slams a door on me.\"\\n\\n \"Especially when your family built half the aquarium,\" he snapped, trying not to look at her breasts.\\n\\n \"Irrelevant. I wouldn\u0027t tolerate that behavior ifyou were fundingmy work. What a disaster area,\" she continued, turning in a circle to take in the whole room. \"How do you find anything in here?\"\\n\\n \"None of your business.\"\\n\\n \"I think we could find some paperwork to prove that isn\u0027t true. What\u0027s so important? What are you working on?\"\\n\\n \"Is playing twenty questions part of the tour?\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s part of being relatively pleasant. And why did you dodge the tour? You don\u0027t even know me.\"\\n\\n Because she was rich. Because he was busy. Because she was a princess and he was a lowly Army brat. Because she was too beautiful. Because she was trouble with a capital T, and he\u0027d had enough of that to last five lifetimes.\\n\\n She was waving a hand in front of his eyes. \"Dr. Rivers? Hellooooo? Is anyone in there? Is it lunchtime already?\"\\n\\n He jerked his head back and gave her a good glare. \"I\u0027ve got more important things to do than play tour guide for a stuck-up VIP.\"\\n\\n He was sure she\u0027d get pissed, but instead, those amazing blue eyes crinkled at the corners and she grinned. \"I bet you don\u0027t,\" she said, and turned to reach for the door handle.\\n\\n \"Okay, okay,\" he said, grasping her elbow. She took his wrist and pulled it away, almost absently, and in the bottom of his brain a small red flag popped up. \"I\u0027ll give you the damned tour. But no annoying questions.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a fine one to talk about annoying,\" she retorted.\\n\\n \"And no potty breaks.\"\\n\\n \"I went on the plane.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m not going to be doing this all day, either.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t,\" she pointed out. \"I\u0027m having lunch with Dr. Tomlin in three hours.\"\\n\\n \"Another rich fat cat,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"Did you just call me fat?\"\\n\\n \"Hardly. In fact, when was the last time you had a meal?\" She was gorgeous—she more than lived up to her moniker as one of the most beautiful women in the world—but too skinny. The planes in her face made her blue eyes seem enormous. \"Or even a milkshake?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said absently. \"It\u0027s probably on the schedule somewhere.\"\\n\\n Another red flag popped, and he was so intrigued he almost forgot about his experiments. \"Well, there\u0027s a snack bar on the second floor. Maybe we can grab some fries or something. Although, once you have to watch Dr. Tomlin eat, you\u0027re gonna lose your appetite. Assuming you ever had one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, Dr. Rivers.\"\\n\\n \"Shel.\"\\n\\n \"Shel. You don\u0027t have to worry. I\u0027m not even hungry. And I\u0027m Alex, by the way.\"\\n\\n He shook her small, cool hand. His wrist was almost twice the width of hers. Definitely needed a few milkshakes, among other tilings.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to meet you, Alex.\"\\n\\n \"What a lie, Dr. Rivers.\"\\n\\n He smiled in spite of himself.\\n\\n Chapter 8\\n\\n The Sitka Palace\\n\\n Juneau, Alaska\\n\\n \"So, how\u0027s she doing?\" the king asked, glancing up from the bill he was reading.\\n\\n Edmund handed him two reams of paperwork. \"Fine, Your Majesty. They landed without incident; she\u0027s at the facility right now.\"\\n\\n \"When\u0027s she due back?\"\\n\\n \"Nineteen days, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Nineteen days? How long\u0027s it take to look at a bunch of fish?\"\\n\\n \"Your Majesty—\"\\n\\n \"I mean, I know we talked about her meeting up with all the hinders and—and whatever the hell else she\u0027s doing out there, but nineteen friggin\u0027 days?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll be fine, Sire.\"\\n\\n The king glowered, blue eyes—eyes he\u0027d passed on to all his children—narrowing. \"I\u0027m pretty sure I didn\u0027t agree to the kid disappearing into the wilds of North Dakota for almost three weeks. I agreed to a quick trip. I agreed things couldn\u0027t go on the way they were. I agreed the shrink wasn\u0027t helping. I did not agree to the kid disappearing for practically a damn month.\"\\n\\n \"Sire, you agreed she was ready for a change.\"\\n\\n \"I smell you and Jenny all over this one, buddy boy, don\u0027t think I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"I would have remembered a nineteen-day itinerary. I\u0027m not that fucking senile.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t underestimate yourself, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Knock it off, Edmund. A quick trip to this aquarium place,that\u0027s what we talked about.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"The kid\u0027s only twenty-three, she\u0027s never been away from home for more than—than—what?\"\\n\\n \"Fifteen days. And Her Highness is twenty-five.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, throw that in my face, you scheming son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n \"Sire, it was bad enough when you arranged for the professors to come to the palace so she could earn her degree without ever moving out. Nineteen days, at her age, is nothing. She\u0027ll be fine, Sire.\"\\n\\n The king drummed his blunt fingers on the desk. \"It\u0027s just that she\u0027s had a tough year.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"You know, she\u0027s not sleeping, she\u0027s not eating—we gotta keep an eye on her.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"I know she looks tough, but she\u0027s fragile.\"\\n\\n \"Like a precious baby duck, Sire.\"\\n\\n The king\u0027s frown deepened. \"What are you up to, Edmund?\"\\n\\n \"Not a tiny thing, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Just because you\u0027re six times smarter than me doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t kick your ass.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m well aware, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, I won\u0027t jump a plane to bring her back—\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t, Sire, you have a meeting with the Tourism Commission in thirty minutes.\"\\n\\n \"—but I want updates on what she\u0027s doing at least twice a day.\"\\n\\n \"Creepy, Sire.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you know what I mean. Just keep me informed. You know, pretend like I\u0027m your boss or something and you have to do what I say or you\u0027re breaking the law.\"\\n\\n \"Jenny will keep us updated, Sire, and Her Highness will do as she pleases.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-6.html","bookId":2790,"book":{"id":2790,"title":"The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2)","description":"Storyline: The Royal Pain (Alaskan Royal Family #2) \\n PMarine biologist Dr. Shel (\"Never Sheldon\") Rivers has a problem.
