{"id":39654,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII AFTER THE STORM","content":"Bob Otway was down very early upon the morning after the great storm, and he was not a little surprised to find Dick Fenton waiting upon the plateau before the hotel, whence he surveyed the newly-fallen snow with greedy eyes. In truth, Dick was telling himself that he would take Marjory up to the wood again, and compel her to confess that she loved him; an unnecessary repetition of an ancient story, but pleasant enough when white arms go with it. Bob Otway was less sentimental. He confessed that he felt a little down, and he added the information that the concierge was a \"nut.\" There had been great \"events\" last night after Dick went to bed to dream of Marjory; much damage had been done. All this would be charged for when the weekly bills were sent on, and as Bob asked ruefully: \"What do you think a \u0027cello\u0027s worth, Dick; is it worth thirty shillings?\" By which he implied the destruction of such an instrument and his own share therein. \"It was Rivers who began it,\" he explained, as they strolled about arm in arm, waiting for the bell to announce morning coffee: \"He tried to hang up the big clock in the hall with a drawing pin, and when the concierge spotted him, Billy Godeyer was doing the same for the picture of the Battle of Sedan. Then Rivers found that the band had left their instruments behind in the drawing-room, and we had a concert. Never saw such rot; I played the \u0027cello and all the hair came out of the bow before I\u0027d sawed out half a tune. They say we smashed five notes in the piano, but I don\u0027t believe it. Old Gordon Snagg doesn\u0027t like noise, so we played on his account; he\u0027d pay the damage if he were a gentleman.\" Dick agreed to that, but didn\u0027t much care to talk about music. The night had brought pleasant dreams of Marjory. He really was rather sorry that they had chosen the \"little widow\" for their ambassador. \"We were in too much of a hurry,\" he said, arguing in a philosophical if amatory vein. \"Why not let it run until we get back to England? It\u0027s beastly to think about money in such a place as this, and I\u0027m sure Marjory would hate me for doing it. I\u0027ll speak to my uncle when I get back, and he might do something for me. Perhaps he\u0027ll send me out to Canada; there\u0027s lots of cash to be made there, and why shouldn\u0027t we make some of it? Let\u0027s have some fun, Bob. You\u0027re such a gloomy beggar; you always look at things in the worst light.\" Bob retorted that it depended upon the age of the lady; a vague and half-truthful remembrance of the havoc which the sun had played with the otherwise peach-like skin of a nameless nymph. The morning found him in a dubious-mood about Nellie, but less alarmed about the enormity of the offence. She really was a \"jolly little girl,\" and it had been quite impossible not to propose to her in the circumstances. With good luck, her views upon the final step of matrimony might be as distant as his own. And who could say that something would not turn up? \"Mrs. Rider will make the devil of a row about it, and we shall have to clear out,\" he said musingly. \"I know she brought the girls here to get \u0027em off, but she won\u0027t think very much of the particular planks for this particular plunge. I\u0027m sorry, too, that we spoke to the \u0027little widow.\u0027 It\u0027s rather jolly to be thought rich, though it wouldn\u0027t be honest to the girls to leave them under that impression. I shall tell Nellie just what I\u0027ve got when we\u0027re up in the wood this morning. Two hundred a year sounds all right when someone else is paying your hotel bill. It\u0027s when you come to running a pug dog and a motor-car that you find where the slice pinches.\" \"But one would begin in a small way, Bob.\" Bob shook his head. \"That\u0027s what the modern girl tells you; she follows it up with the hint that she\u0027d like a flat overlooking the park, and really couldn\u0027t live in Bayswater. It\u0027s a day of big ideas and little balances. I believe my old guv\u0027nor was right when he said that money was the greatest curse that ever came into the world. There\u0027d be a lot of happiness if it wasn\u0027t for money, Dick. Think of it, if fashion wasn\u0027t so rotten, we might camp out the first year, live in a tent for two, and sleep by the roadside. I\u0027m told it\u0027s healthy, and I know Mecredy did it. There\u0027d be no rent to pay, and we might sell our portraits as an advertisement for a tonic. As it is, we\u0027ve just got to own up that we\u0027re paupers; and if the girls take pity on us—well, we\u0027ll feel smaller than ever.\" Dick was not so sure of it. Ancient fables concerning the angelic qualities of the sex still buoyed him up with youthful hopes. \"Oh,\" he said loftily, \"that\u0027s all rot, Bob. Money\u0027s something, of course, but lots of girls don\u0027t think much about it. Look at old Gordon Snagg. He\u0027s supposed to be worth half a million; they say he paid ten thousand for his knighthood; do you think Marjory would have had him if he\u0027d have proposed to her? Give sentiment half a chance. Surely, it is possible to believe that the girl you\u0027re going to marry has some other ideas but those of your bank balance?\" Bob would not give in. \"Wait until old Mrs. Rider gets going,\" he exclaimed sententiously. \"We shall hear some home truths then, old chap, and just when we were beginning to enjoy ourselves. By Jove, isn\u0027t it a day! Look at the sun on the old Rothhorn; isn\u0027t it splendid, Dick? and it rises upon our hour of woe. Well, I suppose the ancient martyrs went through this kind of thing; but I\u0027m hanged if I wouldn\u0027t sooner go to the dentist any day. What shall we say to the old girl? How shall we tell her that the truth—?\" \"I shall tell her for Marjory\u0027s sake. Why, I believe she\u0027s up at the window there, and Nellie as well. Don\u0027t you see them, Bob?\" The girls were giggling behind the sun-blind of a third-floor window, but they disappeared almost instantly when their object of attracting attention had been achieved. It still wanted ten minutes to the first breakfast-bell, and a few active folk had now appeared to enjoy the sunshine, or to drag luges up the ice-run and have a \"canter\" down before the coffee. The latter idea appealed to the boys; and getting their luges from the hall, they went up to the starting-point. This was the moment, however, when a little procession appeared upon the mountain track above them; and being attracted by the novelty of the spectacle, they stood to see it pass. \"They\u0027re soldiers, aren\u0027t they, Bob?\" \"Looks very much like it. What can they be doing up here?\" \"Would it be about the story? Surely, they can\u0027t have found the man?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t wonder; why, here\u0027s our little Frenchman, who wanted to tell us all about it yesterday. He\u0027ll know what\u0027s up; let\u0027s ask him.\" \"But he doesn\u0027t understand your French!\" Bob was not to be daunted. Walking across the snow to the edge of the wood, he took off his hat to the Frenchman, and asked him the question: \"What are they doing up there, monsieur?\" The reply overwhelmed the young man by its velocity. He caught the word un mort, or thought that he did; but so great was the stranger\u0027s desire to tell him that a flood of terrible English followed upon the outbreak. The soldiers had been searching the snow for the body of a comrade, so much Bob made of it; and not only had they been searching, but the quest had been successful. They were now carrying the dead man down to Andana, whence the body would be conveyed in a sleigh to Martigny. With which intimation, and some incoherent reflections upon the whole tragedy, the Frenchman turned upon his heel and left them. His own curiosity would take him some distance in the wake of the procession. Like all his race, the psychology of crime fascinated him beyond any other study. The youths, in their turn, were not a little awed by this gruesome spectacle, nor could they remain insensible to its romance. Down below, upon the plateau, were the first of the merrymakers, the outposts of a vigorous life, the careless creatures of laughter and the sunshine. Here upon the height, beneath a tracery of silver, upon a path still in shadow, were the emblems of death and eternal sleep. Stern figures, whose footfalls fell soft upon the untrodden snow, moved with military rhythm about the body of their comrade. None spoke, none paused, the faces of all were hard set and expressionless. To-morrow the whole of Switzerland would be talking of this crime; to-day it was but a muttered whisper, which hardly echoed in the woods which harboured it. But of this the lads knew nothing, and when the procession disappeared from their view they went racing down to the Palace; where they arrived at the precise moment of Miss Marjory and Miss Nellie Rider\u0027s appearance, in virginal white. The \"girls\" were dreadfully important people this morning. And how little they thought of the married women!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1793/52159.html","bookId":1079,"book":{"id":1079,"title":"White Motley","description":"简介： The New House at Holmswell lies, far back from the road, upon the great highway to Norwich.
