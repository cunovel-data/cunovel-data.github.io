{"id":39665,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV THE DOCTOR INTERVENES","content":"The world is as little interested in the harvest another reaps of his success as in the dinner he ate yesterday. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny\u0027s flight for the great prize had been a pleasant interlude at Andana, an excitement which might be permitted to postpone for a day the necessary operations of skating, ski-ing and curling. But when the flight had been accomplished, the little colony returned with what zest it could to its pleasures. These, unhappily, were pursued but sadly on the day following the great event. A cold bitter wind blew up the valley from Visp, and the snow fell incessantly during the morning and again at night, as has been told. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny was not sorry that things should turn out so. He dreaded a new invasion of the chalet, and had very much to do before he could leave the country. It was true, as Harry Clavering had said, that splendid offers had been made to him by his own people, but there were other offers both from France and from Switzerland, and he spent a good deal of his morning trying to plan out a campaign which should satisfy all concerned. A little later on Dr. Orange came in as though by accident, and when Brother Jack had gone upstairs to begin the packing, the doctor broached a private affair in which he presupposed a mutual interest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the way,\" he said, \"you know that Lady Delayne has left here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny, who was in the act of lighting his pipe, threw the match into the fireplace and looked at the doctor sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gone to London, hasn\u0027t she?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor thought not. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" he said, \"they tell me it is to Italy. Her husband is there, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny made no attempt to evade it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"I do know he\u0027s there. The question is, how did you find out, Doctor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, doctors hear everything. To begin with, I recognised Luton Delayne outside the Palace Hotel just as you did. He must have come to us after the affair at Grindelwald. Directly his wife arrived here I thought her face very familiar. I remember meeting them at a dinner party in Onslow Square—it must be three or four years ago. She\u0027s a woman you could not forget. We all think that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny did not say that he thought it. A shrewd judge of men, he believed that a spirit of friendship had sent the doctor to the chalet, and he was grateful to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" he enjoined. \"I guess the whole place would be about unanimous if that lady were in the case. But you haven\u0027t answered my question, Doctor; you haven\u0027t told me how you knew she was going into Italy. I\u0027m curious, for I knew nothing about it. In fact, I didn\u0027t quite expect her to go at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor took a cigarette from his case and lighted it carefully. His eyes had a curious trick of looking first to the right of him and then to the left, as though seeking inspiration from the carpet, and he twisted his shadow of a moustache quite fiercely while he pondered a reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"I think that our objects are quite the same. Suppose I say that it was the gendarme here, the man they call Philip Gaillarde; would you be astonished at that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should be astonished at nothing in Luton Delayne\u0027s case. When did you get the news?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, in the café this morning. There is a girl there named Susette; the young man is interested, it appears, and she is one of my patients. I have been attending her some days for a little hysteria—nothing serious, but quite alarming to the love-sick swain. Somehow she learned that he is going away, and is in a great state about it. She thinks he is in danger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of never returning to Andana—which is to say that she knows—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at his friend shrewdly, and seemed to be waiting for the fuller confession to come from him. Benny debated it an instant, his teeth gnawing the stem of his pipe. Then he spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean to say that Philip Gaillarde has gone into Italy to arrest Sir Luton?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is exactly how I would put it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that he knows the whole story?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any doubt about it. He has been told that Luton Delayne was the man, and he has obtained permission to go to Locarno and to help the police there. It is his own idea—though the local police should be very well able to help themselves. The question for us is one of social jurisprudence. Is it good for the other English, for the people who come here every year, to have this scandal to their discredit? I would go further, and ask, is it at any time wise to push such a case against such a family as the Delaynes? Speaking for myself, I don\u0027t think it is. Luton Delayne is a modern type; I suppose in New York they would understand him very well; but here we are educated slowly. The Swiss police are a little more ignorant than ourselves. I have had a chat with Ardlot, the French secretary at the hotel, and he tells me that they will be merciless if they succeed in arresting the man. We know what that means; perhaps we are interested enough to ask how others might take it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny pulled heavily at his pipe. When he removed it from his lips it was to say: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t the singular number be better, Doctor? Shouldn\u0027t we say \u0027one other\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you like it so, by all means. But, let me tell you, I am talking quite in the dark; I don\u0027t know where Gaillarde speaks the truth; I am quite unaware if Delayne is in Italy, or no. That\u0027s why I came to you—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you believe that I know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am sure you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a spell the two men sat looking at each other in silence. Benny neither denied nor affirmed the charge. His eyes searched the flickering fire as though for an inspiration. The problem was clear enough; he wondered if the doctor knew how much it meant to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess you\u0027re a bit of a thought reader, Doctor,\" he exclaimed of a sudden, taking up the conversation exactly as it was left. \"I do know where Luton Delayne is, and that\u0027s a fact. Let me be as plain with you. What you came here to do was to warn me. You wish me to know that the police are inquiring after him. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s a little late for that? Gaillarde will be half-way to Brigue by this time. He\u0027ll be in Milan before we\u0027ve done our second breakfast. What\u0027s the good of all this then, knowing what we do? Isn\u0027t it a bit foolish?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Orange hardly understood him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear fellow,\" he protested, \"I was not thinking anything of the kind. Will not the telegraph serve our purpose just as well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look all round it, and then decide,\" he said quietly. \"This lad has heard that Delayne is in Italy. Does he know where he is? If he does not, we may be right enough. If he does, a telegram may be the thing, or it may not. I\u0027ll have to calculate the chances. Before I can do that I must see this girl, Susette. Would she be still at the café, do you think? Should I find her there if I went down this afternoon? If so, I\u0027ll see her and let you know. There\u0027s time enough anyway; we can\u0027t run after the morning train to Milan, and I don\u0027t suppose either of us is going to try. What I would say before all is that I like the friendship which sent you here, Doctor. I shan\u0027t forget that, nor will Lady Delayne, when she hears about it. Did you say, by the way, that she has gone across the frontier? Don\u0027t I remember something about that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is quite true, or will be true. She was at Sierre last night waiting for an opportunity. I should not wonder if she went this morning by the same train as Gaillarde. Ardlot told me how it was; he saw her at the Terminus, and heard what she was doing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then she certainly will have gone through this morning. I am very much obliged to you. Whatever is done, shall be done after a talk with you. It would be about half-past two or three, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They assented, and parted upon it, the doctor returning to the Palace, Benny calling Brother Jack and the abbé down to lunch. When the repast was finished he made some excuse, and taking his rough sweater and snow helmet, he set off for the village of Andana and the café where the girl, Susette, was to be found. It was a little after two o\u0027clock, and the plateau quite deserted. He remembered that the guests at the Palace would hardly have finished their coffee, and hurried on with an anxiety very foreign to his nature. \\n\\n \\n\\n Where did his duty lie, and to whom? It was true that the gendarme, Philip, had spoken of this visit to Italy on the eve of the flight; but it had been a tentative proposal, and depended upon the permission of his superiors. Then, as now, Benny perceived that if the lad did not know the whereabouts of the shanty, there would be no risk whatever, and Philip might be less dangerous at Milan than at Andana. If, on the other hand, the story of the shanty were known, then that was the end of it. Why, Sir Luton might be arrested that very night. And if he were, Lily Delayne must be a free woman before many weeks had passed. Benny shuddered a little when he remembered this, and walked on the faster. The victor\u0027s laurel suited him but ill, and many a poor wretch by the wayside might have pitied him. \\n\\n \\n\\n She would be a free woman! He repeated the words often, dwelling upon them with an interest which frightened him. Not for the first time did he understand how little victory meant to him, and how bitter were the fruits of success. He must lead a lonely life, whatever the honour of it. He saw himself slaving in study or workshop, a man without a definite goal, one whose interest had no corner-stone. And it were idle to say that there was a woman who could change all this and breathe anew upon a dead inspiration. His ideas were old and built upon an ancient faith. Fate had set a barrier between Lily and himself, and none but Almighty God could remove it. \\n\\n \\n\\n She would be a free woman! Yes, surely, that could be brought about easily enough. He had but to forbear, to return to his house as he had come, or simpler, just to whisper a word or two to the Chief of Police at Sierre, and there would be no difficulty about the matter. When he thought of this he laughed aloud because he had dared to think of it. In the same mood the best of men have asked themselves what would happen if they committed murder or robbed a bank or began to starve their children. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was less easy to deal with the subtle question of what could or could not be done. How if it were impossible to stop this mad youth, who would avenge his brother? It might be so; the chances were that Philip was already on the way to Locarno, and would do his work before any could interfere. Benny thought of this, and hurried on to the café. The girl, Susette, would help him—he was quite confident about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here luck favoured him, for old Ma?tre Rousset, the proprietor of the café, declared that his daughter had just gone down to the post-office, and would be back inside five minutes. He was delighted to welcome Monsieur Benson, the great Englishman, to his house; and he began to ask him a thousand questions about his art and achievement. Like many others, he had devised a flying machine twenty years ago, and he called for a glass of vermouth while he unfolded its wings, so to speak, and drew, with the stem of a brier pipe, a plan upon the table before him. When Susette came in, it needed all Benny\u0027s ingenuity to get a word with her; but he managed it at last by sending her father upon an errand to the telephone, and promising him that he should see the machine if he came up to the chalet later on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Susette was a brunette, with the figure of a woman and the face of a child. Her skin was very white, her cheeks inordinately red, when she returned from her errand down the village street. It was plain that she had been running in her eagerness to return. Someone had told her that the hero of the day was at the café, and knowing him to be the friend of her lover, Philip, she ran all the way from the post-office that she might not miss him. A few kindly words upon Benny\u0027s part put her quite at her ease. Oh, yes, she knew that Monsieur Philip had gone into Italy; he would be back in three or four days at the most, for that was his promise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has gone to Locarno, Monsieur. I am quite sure of it. He went by the first train this morning, and should reach his destination to-night. I have just posted a letter to him, which he will receive to-morrow. It is lonely to be so far away from us all. I do not think he has any friends in Italy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you do not know why he has gone there, Susette?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Susette opened her black eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course, I know, Monsieur; it is to arrest the Englishman who killed his brother on the Zaat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think he will be able to find the fellow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Susette peeped through the door to be sure that no one heard her, and then drew a little nearer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am glad that you came, Monsieur. You are a brave gentleman, and will tell me truly. There was a servant here, a Monsieur Paul Lacroix. He gave my Philip an address upon a piece of paper—one he got from the chalet where the English lady was staying. I have never liked Paul Lacroix; I do not think he means well to Philip. That is what makes me so anxious. I think he has been serving his own purpose, and that he feared to do the work himself. So he has sent my Philip. You will tell me truly, Monsieur, if that was right or just?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny had no idea how to answer her. Her news astonished him beyond any he had expected to hear. It was as though the whole of the plot had been revealed in an instant, and being revealed, her news said that all was lost. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will see what we can do,\" he rejoined, evading it in despair. \"Perhaps I shall be visiting Italy myself. Your father has gone to the telephone to book a place for me to-night. We will think about what is to be done directly we hear where Monsieur Philip is. Meanwhile, don\u0027t you fret about it, Susette. Your boy is all right, and I will bring him back to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She began to cry at this; it is the office of friendship to provoke the tears which are hidden from the unsympathetic. When old Rousset returned, he found the Englishman pacing the room like a caged lion, while Susette dried her tears on the corner of a far from clean apron. His rebuke to her was harsh and commanding; she slunk from the room as though fearing a new humiliation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That girl is becoming a nuisance to me,\" the old man said. \"I shall have to send her to England to work, as her sisters are doing. It is the loneliness of the mountains, Monsieur; even I suffer from that sometimes. You English people stay here such a little while; you do not know what it is to see those great white walls shutting out the world always. Well, well, Susette will be better in England; and I, perhaps, may go to Paris and remember that I have been young.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He laughed, and looked at the paper in his hand. The trains to Italy—had he not been sent to inquire about them? Well, there were no trains. There had been an accident beyond Brigue, and it was doubtful when the line would be cleared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am quite sure about it, Monsieur, for the chief answered me himself. You cannot go to-night; it is out of the question.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny stood for an instant rocking upon his heels. His cheeks had flushed suddenly, and his fists were clenched almost convulsively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When did this accident happen?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At midday, I think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know if the morning train got through to Milan?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am able to say so; it was mentioned by the superintendent, and the last train to reach Italy, I believe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, then, that is all, Ma?tre Rousset. Thank you very much. I shall see you later on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He waited for no reply, but hurried from the café like one possessed. So swiftly did he walk, that he had almost passed the door of the Palace Hotel before he remembered his promise to the doctor and the necessity of keeping it. The hour was favourable to that, for the players were out on the mountains again, and the doctor entertained a little company in the drawing-room, where he played one of Chopin\u0027s nocturnes with an exquisite touch and a feeling for the music of it quite beyond ordinary. Nor would Benny interrupt him. The haunting melody lingered as a memory of children\u0027s voices; the pathos of life stood expressed in it; the hope, and fear, and dread which afflicted his mind at this very moment. Such chords were struck by the Master of human destiny when the souls of men were offered upon the altars of life. Benny trembled while he heard them, and, trembling, he saw the woman\u0027s face as in a vision. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Orange came out presently and heard his news with interest. The story of the mishap at Brigue had not entered into his calculations. It seemed to say that nothing could be done to further their ends, unless they sent a telegram to the shanty in the hope that it would be in time. On the other hand, there was a possibility that Susette might not have been correctly informed, and that the gendarme, Philip, had but a vague idea of Delayne\u0027s whereabouts. If this were the case, it would be madness to employ the telegraph, open as it was to the scrutiny of the police. In the end the doctor agreed that it would be wiser to wait; and then he asked if it would not be possible to drive across the pass? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You might be at Locarno to-morrow night,\" he suggested, and bethought him in the same breath that the trains would be running through the tunnel from the point where the accident had happened. This suggested another course. Why not take the train to Brigue, and learn just what had happened? To which Benny responded in his quiet way that it was neck or nothing. Either Philip knew, or he did not know. If he knew, Sir Luton would be in a prison before nightfall, and England would have the story to-morrow! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unless a man can buy a magic carpet,\" he remarked with a shrug, \"there\u0027s nothing further to be said. I\u0027d drive across the pass willingly if I thought it would do any good. You know that it won\u0027t. Doctor, and that\u0027s the end of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then there is no other way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None at all, unless I run out my machine, and get there over the mountains.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You could do it, Benson; I think you would do it if your own wife or sister were concerned. Have you thought about it? I see the wind has dropped. It would not take you very long, would it now? Well, I must leave it to you. It\u0027s for you to decide, and you know what can be done so much better than I do. If I see Lady Delayne, I shall not forget to tell her how much trouble you took. She is the kind of woman who remembers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benny said he thought that she was, but they had no other chance to speak of it, for the Rider girls came galloping into the conservatory at that moment and carried off the doctor triumphantly. It was about three o\u0027clock then, and already growing dark. Benny perceived that the wind had fallen, and that a dead calm had come down. There would be an interval merely of hours, he thought, before it began to blow again. He must make up his mind immediately. The weather would have nothing to do with argument. \\n\\n \\n\\n He must go and warn Luton Delayne, and must warn him for Lily\u0027s sake. If he did not go, she might be a free woman before the summer came, and it might lie no longer against his conscience that he loved her. Permitting his thoughts to run on, he would say that by such a woman\u0027s love would his future be assured. He saw himself working for her, devoting all his genius to her service and raising himself above the class into which he had been born. The world knew his name already; but that was merely the beginning of things. He had worshipped the very ground this woman trod, and she must be the guiding star of his life to the end. What then carried him to Locarno—what paradox of duty or service? He could not answer the question, but the vision remained and haunted him. \\n\\n \\n\\n To cross the Simplon Valley and descend to Italy. It was a child\u0027s task for a man who had circled the great Pennine chain. True, the storm might come down again, and if it did come down, the unfortunate who was caught aloft in it would lose his life! Well, and what had life in store on this side? Again, the voice said, she will be a free woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood at the chalet which had been her home, and looked across toward Brigue and the mountains. They jutted out in bold relief, showing their whitened domes clearly in the still air, and catching waning rays of the sinking sun. Beyond them lay Italy and the lake. Perchance—but of that he had no sure knowledge—Lily was already with her husband; she would witness his shame and be, in a sense, a partner of it. He remembered her as he had seen her at the door of the chalet—a woman without a friend. Had she not called herself that? He turned away at the remembrance, and went on toward his own house. \\n\\n \\n\\n The mechanics were waiting to pack the aeroplane and send it through to Paris. Benny went in among them and began to speak of delay. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1793/52170.html","bookId":1079,"book":{"id":1079,"title":"White Motley","description":"简介： The New House at Holmswell lies, far back from the road, upon the great highway to Norwich.
