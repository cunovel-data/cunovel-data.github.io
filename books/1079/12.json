{"id":39652,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI THE VIGIL OF TRAGEDY","content":"Lily watched the boys go down the hillside, and when they were lost to view she did not move from the door of the chalet. An onlooker might have said that her eyes searched the heights for tidings they alone could give her. A bitter wind blowing up the valley, a sky pregnant with omens of tempest, did not drive her back to the shelter of the house. She was unconscious of the cold, and took a cloak from the saturnine maid with a smile and a protest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really do not want it, Louise—I don\u0027t feel the cold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Madame, it is going to snow; you will be ill, Madame, and no one to nurse you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lily put the cloak about her shoulders, and then asked the girl another question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you see a lantern upon the hillside, Louise, up there below Vermala?\" The maid, grown curious, came and stood with her, but declared she could see nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There were gendarmes by here just now, Madame. I know them both, Albert and Philip, from Sion; there will have been trouble at the hotel, then; they would not send Monsieur Albert if it were not so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lily nodded her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do not often have trouble up here, Louise?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, Madame, the world is all the same whether you are up in the mountains or down in the valleys. There are wicked people at Andana, just as anywhere else. It would be one of the waiters who has robbed his master. There are Germans at Vermala, and they are all thieves—so, you see, the police must be here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lily made no reply. The lanterns had come into view by this time, and could be seen dancing to and fro upon the high path which leads up to the hotel perched upon the plateau below the Zaat. It was apparent that the men were not searching the hillside as she had supposed; and, when she was sure of this, she shut the door and went back to the little library. Louise, meanwhile, had returned to the kitchen to prepare the modest supper which should be served at eight o\u0027clock. Perhaps the gendarmes would pay the chalet a visit upon their return, in view of which possibility some culinary diligence was necessary. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the library, Lily sat down to her writing-table to finish a letter to her brother Harold, laid aside upon the appearance of the boys, and now taken up with reluctance. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had been trying to tell her brother to concern himself less with her affairs, and to be sure that whatever she might do, due regard would be paid to the interests and the scruples of others. Such a theme had been difficult enough before the boys appeared; but she found it quite impossible when they had left. Not a line could she write; not a sentence frame. A shadow had enveloped her suddenly, and she could not escape it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Word by word she pieced together the story she had heard and tried to give it a meaning. A man pursued upon the mountain road and another following him! Then a loud cry heard by several people, and the belief, expressed openly, that murder had been done. Shrinking from her own dread of a terrible truth, she could not quiet the voice which told her that there was but one man at Vermala in whom, the probabilities being considered, the police might be interested—and that man, her husband, Luton! Why, the whole trend of his life pointed to such an end as this. And she had feared and dreamed of it since the day she first learned to know him and to realise the tragedy of her own fate. The end would come before all the world, she had said—and the day of it was at hand! \\n\\n \\n\\n She put the letter into the blotting book, and went to the window again. The lanterns were no longer to be seen, and the night had come down with a darkness so intense that even the nearer slopes were invisible. Shut from her eyes, the hidden woods were revealed to a keen imagination which filled them with alien figures, searching here and there for a truth which must so alter her own life (if such a truth existed) that hereafter the whole world would hardly offer her a harbourage from the shame of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n As in a vision, she saw the dead man lying there, deep in the snow, and the white flakes falling anew upon his face. A glow from a lantern searched it out, and declared the horror of the secret. And up there at the hotel another waited, dreading the instant of discovery—perchance preparing already for flight in the hope that discovery might never come. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was all hysterical, and out of harmony with her good common sense, as she admitted when she turned from the window, and, looking at the clock, discovered it to be half-past six precisely. At seven, Luton had promised to come down from Vermala to see if there were a telegram from Sir Frederick Kennaird—letter there could hardly be for another four and twenty hours. If he came, and assuredly he would come, he might very well give an account of the affair which would so deride her fancies that she would be ashamed even to remember them. Or, he might say that he knew nothing of the affair at all, had taken no part in it, and had not heard it named. The latter was quite an optimistic version, to which she clung tenaciously, sitting again at her writing-table and composing quite a satisfactory epistle upon Andana and its people; to which she added excellent reasons for her preference of the chalet she occupied. The hotel, she declared, was far too noisy—her nerves were no longer equal to the exigencies of distracted youth, nor could she support the banalities of a middle-age which sought to stamp out the years by a grotesque display of elephantine energies. From these she had fled to the solitude of the chalet—a half-truth which entirely overlooked the personal element and skimmed over the broken ground where the seeds of slander had fallen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Seven o\u0027clock struck while she was still at the table, but there was no sign of Luton, nor any message from him at the quarter past the hour. If he were late, then, she thought, that was the first occasion she could remember when he had neglected an appointment to his own advantage and the benefit of his creditors. He had told her that his need was urgent, and had sent letters from Bothand and Co. confirming his statements. Nine thousand four hundred pounds must be paid if he would stave off those \"further proceedings\" with which they threatened him; and if he did not pay, then it was clear that the firm would discover at a later date excellent reasons for a criminal prosecution. In such a case, extradition would not be refused, nor would it be difficult for the police to trace a man who was at so little pains to act prudently as Luton Delayne. \\n\\n \\n\\n The clock struck the three-quarters, and Lily put on her cloak and went to the door again. It was snowing heavily by this time, and the wind almost raging in the pass. Despite the rigours of the night, she determined to go a little way upon the road in the hope that she might meet Luton; and she set out bravely, afraid that the wrathful Louise might detect her and yet determined in her purpose. Two hundred yards from the chalet, a burst of light upon the hillside marked the spot where the brothers Benson were living, and by this she must go upon her way to Vermala. It chanced, however, that Jack Benson stood at the door of the shed when she approached, and it was natural to ask him how his brother did. Jack thought little of women, as a rule, and he dreaded this particular woman\u0027s influence with Benny; but he could not answer her uncivilly, and like the others, he was, metaphorically, at her feet before she had spoken twenty words to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that you, Mrs. Kennaird; what a night, isn\u0027t it? Aren\u0027t you rather daring to be out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" she said, \"I had no idea there was such a wind blowing. Will you let me shelter a moment? I\u0027m really quite out of breath. That\u0027s the shed where your brother keeps his aeroplane, is it not? He told me all about it, you know. I\u0027m very much interested.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack muttered to himself that Benny was losing his wits, or he would never have talked about the machine to a woman; but a moment\u0027s reflection reminded him that the sex is rarely of a mechanical turn, and would hardly profit by the confidence. So he threw the door open wide, and the electric lamps blazing within cast a warm aureole upon the snow and upon Lily\u0027s pale face. Perhaps Jack understood his brother\u0027s infatuation then, if he could not condone it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll find us rather upside down,\" he said apologetically. \"We\u0027re always like that when Benny\u0027s away—we haven\u0027t his idea of order. But we\u0027re pretty useful in our way, and the abbé\u0027s as good as any mechanic from Bleriot\u0027s. He\u0027s just turning up the planes, if you understand what that is, Mrs. Kennaird; sewing them up with steel wire, so to speak. I assure you, we\u0027d have gone to pot without the abbé.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little priest looked up and smiled pleasantly. He wore a white apron over his cassock, and sat with one of Benny\u0027s planes over his knee, repairing and relaying the canvas with the skill of a trained workman. Jack himself was enveloped in engineer\u0027s overalls, and had been working at a forge in the far corner; he, too, was liberally decorated with choice smuts, and had a very chart of carbon upon his cheeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you say Mr. Benson is away?\" Lily asked him. Jack responded as one who had a personal grievance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was off before lunch. Wouldn\u0027t eat anything for some reason which he\u0027ll have forgotten by the time he comes back. I don\u0027t know where he is, I\u0027m sure. He always goes away just when we want him most.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, surely, this is a dreadful night to be out; he should have returned by this time?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The abbé nodded his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame is quite right,\" he said; \"he should have returned. It is very necessary for him to be here these days; he will lose a great deal of money if he behaves so foolishly; would that Madame told him as much!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I?\" exclaimed Lily, turning her large eyes upon him. \"But, surely, Mr. Benson would not listen to a woman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He would listen to you,\" Jack rejoined with emphasis. \"He thinks a good deal of your opinion—he told me so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled, but turned away her eyes nevertheless. \"And what am I to say to your brother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell him that he can do it yet, if he will only believe as much. Say that it\u0027s not the game for him to be here, there and everywhere when his future depends on what we\u0027re doing for him. If he wins the ten thousand pounds put up by the London daily paper, he\u0027s a made man for life. There\u0027s nothing Benny could not do with capital, nothing on earth, I do believe. Why, he\u0027s invented a dozen machines as clever as this, and all of them are just so many drawings, because he hasn\u0027t got the money to build them. And here\u0027s ten thousand going begging, so to speak, and he\u0027s dreaming all the time; acting like some moonsick shepherdess, and got just about as much sense in his head. If you\u0027d tell him that, you\u0027d be doing him a very great kindness, Mrs. Kennaird. There\u0027s no one else at Andana who could do it, I assure you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lily looked from one to the other: her face was very pale, her manner unusually earnest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what does Monsieur l\u0027Abbé say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The abbé ceased to work at the canvas upon his knee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that Madame is the only person who could help us,\" he said at length; and having said it he cast down his eyes and went on with his work. She was a clever woman, and she would understand that, he thought. Nor was he mistaken. Madame understood him perfectly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see Mr. Benson so rarely,\" she said. \"Now that I have left the hotel my opportunities will be fewer. But that is not to say that I will not do my best when I do see him, if you care to tell him so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack was delighted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll send him down to your place in the morning,\" he exclaimed; \"that is, with your permission, he shall come directly after breakfast. Perhaps you will be going skating or something. If so, he might meet you on the rink?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled at his eagerness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be pleased to see your brother any time. Now I fear I must go. Is not that eight o\u0027clock striking? My cook will never forgive me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A miserable cuckoo-clock shrieked the hour with intolerable emphasis, and reminded them all of the flesh-pots. Jack, however, remembered his manners sufficiently to escort her down the hillside, and it was a quarter past eight when he left her at her own door. The snow still fell fast, and the wind howled dismally up the valley. It was going to be a dreadful night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t forget,\" he said as he turned at her gate and drew the collar of his heavy coat about his ears. She answered that she would expect Benny sometime during the morning, and immediately went in to ask her servant if anyone had come. When Louise retorted with a shrug of the shoulders and the inquiry, \"Who would come upon such a night?\" Madame had nothing to say. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hours were making it very difficult for her to believe the best. The dawn found her still awake, and quite prepared for that hour of crisis which such a life as Luton\u0027s had made inevitable. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1793/52157.html","bookId":1079,"book":{"id":1079,"title":"White Motley","description":"简介： The New House at Holmswell lies, far back from the road, upon the great highway to Norwich.
