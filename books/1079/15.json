{"id":39655,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV THE GENDARME PHILIP","content":"Lily was usually an early riser, but the night of storm had wearied her, and it was nearly ten o\u0027clock when she rang for her maid to bring her coffee. \n \n This was the hour of the day she preferred to any other in a general way. Then she had letters from her English friends, and journals, often long delayed upon their voyage, but none the less welcome. To open the windows wide and breathe the air blowing straight into the room from the glaciers of the Weisshorn, to sup tea at her leisure and hear of this person and of that who groped their muggy way in London\u0027s chill atmosphere, were pleasures of the day she would not readily forgo. Just as the ascetic believes that the joy of the blessed is to rejoice upon the sufferings of the damned, so did Lily realise her own opportunities the better when contemplating the despair of the pilgrims she had quitted. London was \"awful,\" one woman said; \"you could hardly see how badly dressed the other women were.\" \n \n The morning of the flight brought Louise to the room in a querulous mood. She had quite expected that there would be gendarmes in the kitchen, and was disappointed when none came. True, a postman had told her strange things and had hinted at this and that in a way which irritated her dull understanding; but of news she had none, save that which Madame\u0027s letters implied—and, to be sure, it was a pity she could not read them. Failing the opportunity, she banged them down on the bed as an act of protest, and with the intimation that the sun would close the skating rink at twelve, bounced out of the room with no more grace than she had bounced in. \n \n There were three letters for Lily, all addressed to Mrs. Kennaird; but of the three, the handwriting of one alone arrested her immediate attention. This was from her father, Sir Frederick Kennaird; a long and rambling epistle, expressing all the petulance, the anger and the selfishness of a rich man called upon to surrender a portion of his riches. \n \n Reciting the family story from the moment when she had married Luton Delayne, his first charge concerned her choice of such a man, when it ignored altogether the paternal satisfaction which the marriage had awakened at the moment of its inception. These particular Delaynes, Sir Frederick wrote, had been bad eggs since old General Delayne of Huddlesmere played the knave in the American War, and was shot by a Yankee whose house he had outraged. Nothing was to be hoped from such a family; nor was anything more to be hoped from the writer, should a further request on Luton\u0027s behalf be made. \n \n As to Bothand and Co. and the alleged fraud, Sir Frederick had little sympathy for the West-End jewellers, the majority of whom he declared to be rascals who battened on the folly and the vanity of unfledged boys and vulgar parvenues. Luton\u0027s hint that his wife\u0027s name had been used was received with the derision which, perhaps, it deserved. It was a device, he said, to extort money under a species of blackmail permitted by the law. Should such an allegation be made seriously, it would be met in a way which would surprise these people. Luton\u0027s debt was another thing, and not to be taken lightly. The amount of it he considered incredible; this firm must be nothing less than money-lenders in disguise, and should be treated accordingly. Sir Frederick promised to set his solicitors, Welis and Welis, to work to see what could be done. At the same time, he concluded his reference to an unpleasant affair by the assurance that his son-in-law would yet make a beggar of him, and that Lily owed it to him to see that at his age some consideration was shown for a man who had done so much for them both. \n \n She did not fall to observe that her father said nothing upon the more vital matter of her own unhappiness; nor did he invite her to Benham Priory, whither he had taken his young American wife, Edna. Lily did not need this oversight to assure her that the Priory had ceased to be her home, and that of all the houses she knew, there would the coldest welcome be offered her. These letters from Sir Frederick were so stereotyped in their expressions that they provoked no longer those bitter memories once associated with them, He had ceased to remember any obligations toward his children save those which their importunities thrust upon him; to write to him, who should have been her best friend, had become a humiliation. \n \n She crushed the letter in her hand, and pulling on her dressing gown, she went to the window and looked out. The superb morning had sent a merry throng to the skating rink, where Dr. Orange and Bess Bethune were delighting an envious crowd by a sedate performance in the \"English\" school; while upon the opposite side of the rink, Keith Rivers pirouetted and pranced in the \"International\" fashion, to the satisfaction of the inexpert, who thought the English manner dull. A few beginners were in remote corners, and were as ungoverned ships upon a crowded waterway; but they fell in solemn silence, for it is heresy here to laugh at that ignorance which, even when firmly seated, is so far from bliss. \n \n Cheek by jowl with the skating rink lay the little lake whereon the curlers performed. From this a babel of sounds arose; an awful jargon from which the Esperanto school would have fled in terrified despair. Generals of divisions here roared at soulless \"stanes,\" as though their salvation depended upon a besom. Cries of \"bring her along,\" \"up cows,\" \"well sweepit,\" or \"man, you\u0027re a curler,\" rent the air as the battle cries of warriors. In the intervals of storm there fell the calm of comedy. \"Will ye crack an egg on this, Sandy, dear?\" a Scotchman was heard to remark; but when Sandy did not \"crack an egg\" upon it, his compatriot roared: \"Ah! ye red-headed little deevil, wait till I get doun the rink and catch haud o\u0027 ye\"—a threat which occasioned no surprise, and hardly moved a member of the solemn-faced company to the ghost of a sad smile. \n \n Merry or solemn, it certainly was a scene to remember and to dwell upon. All these healthy people might have been groping in the London fogs but for those wonder-workers who rediscovered Switzerland some twenty years ago. Some of them had been so groping perhaps but yesterday; and here they were, basking in a sunshine hardly known to an English July, reborn to energies they had forgotten, playing the fool in the finest spirit of the Horatian precept. Lily said it was wonderful; and then it occurred to her that she had no part or lot in it. The events of the night were remembered in an instant of wonder that she could have forgotten them even during this idle hour. \n \n In one way the placid ebb and flow of the tides of recreation reassured her. She feared no longer an aftermath of the fracas at Vermala—or, verily, there would be some bruit of it at this early hour of the day. It was impossible for her to believe that a tragedy of moment would be attended in this remote place by no overt manifestation; and of that there was not a sign. To-day, as yesterday, and all the days, the pilgrims set out for the heights on skis; the skaters waltzed and pirouetted to the strains of the tenth-rate orchestra generously provided by the proprietaire; the curlers heaved the \"stanes\" and complained of the sweltering sunshine. None of these suggested a knowledge of drama, remote or intimate. One man alone, the little gendarme, Philip, could have spoken, and he had already passed on toward the Park Hotel. These were hours of respite for this gracious lady, and her gratitude was not feigned. \n \n As to Luton, she had grown accustomed to his habit of procrastination and his incurable levity of life. Any excuse, however trivial, would have kept him from her last night; and she had to admit that he might have been physically unable to come, for this also was one of the shameful secrets. In the latter case, he would visit her this morning; and her imagination already depicted him, sitting in the chair by the window, and pulling ceaselessly at his long red moustache, while he asked her news and complained that it was not what he had expected. \n \n Here, of course, she was at fault, and the only visitor who presented himself at the chalet was Mr. Benjamin Benson, who, in the language of seamen, had \"cleaned himself\" and donned a suit of clothes which astonished both his brother and the abbé. To their many questions, Benny replied that the storm kept him at Sierre, and that the \"stuff\" had not come; and when this was said, he heard their tale about the \"little widow,\" and her desire to see him, and marched off to the chalet without another word. He found her dressed rather prettily in a heavy jacket of white wool and a violet hat which showed the many perfections of her pale face, and did not hide the beauty of her eyes. Benny thought her so beautiful that he was almost afraid to look her in the face when he spoke to her; but he knew that he had a part to play, and must play it bravely if he would succeed. \n \n She met him at the gate of the chalet, but did not suggest that they should return there. It seemed wicked, as both admitted, to be indoors upon such a morning; and she fully believed that she could deliver his brother\u0027s message as eloquently upon the hillside as in her own drawing-room. Concerning his own absence she had little curiosity, for she was unaware that he knew of the affair at Vermala, and would never have associated it with his visit to Sierre. At the same time, she thought that he might have some news of Luton, and was anxious to hear it. \n \n \"So you were caught in the storm, Mr. Benson?\" \n \n He said that it was so, and then he asked a question in his turn. \n \n \"You\u0027d never guess who went with me to Sierre, Lady Delayne.\" \n \n \"Why should I guess it?\" \n \n He looked round about him and turned deliberately toward the deserted path which led to the Park Hotel. \n \n \"Let\u0027s go this way,\" he said evasively. \"There are too many human gramophones at Andana to my way of thinking, and some of them must have known Ananias. Well, about Sierre? Sir Luton was my fellow passenger—\" \n \n \"My husband—then he—!\" \n \n She stood quite still, and her face had become waxen in its pallor. Benny did not look at her, and recited his story to the woods upon his right hand. \n \n \"Yes, Sir Luton. There was a bit of a row up at Vermala yesterday, and his temper got the better of him. They tell me he struck one of the gendarmes from Martigny; you can\u0027t do that sort of thing with impunity hereabouts. If there\u0027s a fuss, he\u0027s better across the frontier, and so I told him. That\u0027s what took him down to the town with me—I thought the climate of the lakes would suit him better for a day or two—and there he is as safe and sound as a bird in a nest. If you hear any stories, don\u0027t you believe a word of them. It\u0027s my advice to you to return to England to your father\u0027s house as soon as you can do it conveniently. These foreigners make a rare hullaballoo if you lay a finger on them. They\u0027ll ask you ten thousand questions if you\u0027ll let them. Don\u0027t give them the opportunity, Lady Delayne—say your father wants you back, and you are going. That\u0027s my advice, and it\u0027s good common sense. I\u0027ll drive you down to Sierre this afternoon, if you like. You could catch the Simplon to-night, and be in London to-morrow; I hope you\u0027ll let me, for if they find out that Mr. Faikes is really Sir Luton Delayne, then there\u0027ll be no end to the trouble. Now, will your ladyship think of it?\" \n \n He spoke with unwonted earnestness, as though her case were his own, and she really must be led to see the importance of it. If any other had told her such a story, Lily would have disbelieved every word of it; but here was a very apostle of candour, and who would doubt him? \n \n \"Do you mean to say that I am to return to England because my husband has had a foolish quarrel with the authorities? Do you mean that, Mr. Benson?\" \n \n He nodded his head almost savagely. \n \n \"Foreigners are all right when you keep the right side of them. Sir Luton\u0027s temper got the better of him, and there would have been the devil to pay if he had not cleared off. I don\u0027t want you to be troubled about it, and so I say: Go back to England at once. I shall be stopping on here, and I can put matters right if anything is said. Don\u0027t you think I am wise, Lady Delayne; now, really, don\u0027t you think so?\" \n \n \"I think you are kind, very kind, to interest yourself in those who are comparative strangers to you. And if it was but a fracas as you say—\" \n \n He laughed it off, clenching his hands and pursing his lips to the boldest lie he had ever told in all his life: \n \n \"Just a vulgar row and nothing more. We should laugh at it in England, but they\u0027ve other notions here. I don\u0027t want you to be bothered about it, and so I\u0027m all for the journey to Sierre and the Simplon to-night. Give me leave, and I\u0027ll telephone for tickets right away. You\u0027d be wise to do that, Lady Delayne—I\u0027m sure you\u0027d be wise—\" \n \n \"But, my dear Mr. Benson, I have friends coming from Caux this afternoon. I could not go away in such a hurry; it would be too ridiculous in the circumstances.\" \n \n Benny did not know what to say. His anxiety for her had become almost pitiful. Perhaps he would have betrayed himself altogether, but for the sudden appearance of the gendarme, Philip, who emerged from the wood upon their left hand, and sauntered down toward them with his eyes searching the ground and his hands crossed behind his back. This was a ghost to stem the flood of eloquence suddenly. Benny turned pale when he saw Philip, and his agitation was not to be hidden from his companion. \n \n \"Who is that?\" she asked him with awakened curiosity. He shook his head. \n \n \"One of the gendarmes from Martigny. I saw him at the station last night.\" \n \n \"Then why do you see him with displeasure this morning?\" \n \n \"He may be here on our affair. I\u0027ve told you what I think. They\u0027ll be questioning you about it if you stay.\" \n \n \"But, surely, I shall be able to answer them! Is a woman responsible for her husband\u0027s follies—even in Switzerland? I do not think so, Mr. Benson; you are not quite honest with me—there is something yet to come?\" \n \n He shook his head. \n \n \"I have told you what I think, Lady Delayne. It\u0027s for you to decide. I can quite understand that you may not be able to go away this afternoon, but to-morrow, or the next day, perhaps? Will you think it over, and let me know? I shall be round this way after dinner to-night, and I\u0027ll look in, with your-permission. Now I must run away, for I see the abbé throwing his arms about up yonder, and that\u0027s to say the lunch is on the table. Isn\u0027t it wonderful that a man cannot go three or four hours without food and remain in his right senses? It\u0027s true, though, so, you see, I\u0027ll just run away. But you\u0027ll think of what I\u0027ve said, won\u0027t you?—and you\u0027ll know that I\u0027m your friend, come what may!\" \n \n He held put his hand to her with an awkward gesture, and felt her soft fingers lying for an instant in his own. The look which she gave him was a reward beyond his expectations; he returned to the chalet with the step of a boy, and was hoping and believing a hundred good things when he met the gendarme, Philip, almost at his own door. \n \n \"Ah, my lad, I am glad to see you again,\" he said. \"Were you not at Sierre last night with the valet of my friend, Mr. Faikes?\" \n \n Philip looked up quickly. \n \n \"Of your friend, Sir—?\" \n \n Benny did not appear to notice it. \n \n \"The Englishman staying at Vermala,\" he persisted; and then he asked: \"Do you know him also?\" \n \n Philip answered as quickly. \n \n \"Yes, I know this Englishman, sir; he killed my brother, Eugène. Am I to understand that he is a friend of yours?\" \n \n Benny grabbed the man by the arm, and began to walk him to and fro upon the narrow path. He was acting now with all the art he could command. Yes, he had seen the Englishman several times; was he the man who struck the officer, Eugène Gaillarde, on the hillside? Who would have thought it? But then, to be sure, no one knew the fellow very well: a sour-tempered bully, who had come from Cannes, and gone, they said, to Paris. Had Monsieur Philip heard that the Englishman had gone to Paris? Well, it was so, and he, Benny, had seen him at the station—indeed, he had driven him some way on the road. It would be useful to remember that. Perhaps Monsieur Philip would be glad of the information? \n \n The young man heard the strange tale to the end, but he expressed neither surprise nor gratitude. He had come to Andana to learn what he could, and when his work was done he would know the Englishman\u0027s story and where to seek him. \"And then, monsieur,\" he added with almost savage conviction, \"I shall arrest him with my own hands.\" \n \n Benny did not argue with him; he saw that this idea obsessed him, and that words were vain. His own acting, clever as it was, appeared to have made no impression whatsoever upon the gendarme, and when the man left him, it was to go on with the same quiet step and unchanging resolution, up toward the height where his brother had perished. Benny, however, stood for a little while at the door of the chalet looking down toward Lily\u0027s house. Did she believe the story he had told her with such poor wit? \n \n He knew not what to think. It was hardly a week ago she had come to Andana; but the days had changed his own life beyond all knowledge, and had left him with but one ambition in the world. He would lift the burden from her shoulders if he could—the burden of shame which threatened to overwhelm her utterly. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1793/52160.html","bookId":1079,"book":{"id":1079,"title":"White Motley","description":"简介： The New House at Holmswell lies, far back from the road, upon the great highway to Norwich.
