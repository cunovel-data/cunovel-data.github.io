{"id":2159,"no":44,"title":"Chapter 44","content":"As Sethe walked to work, late for the first time in sixteen years and wrapped in a timeless present,Stamp Paid fought fatigue and the habit of a lifetime. Baby Suggs refused to go to the Clearingbecause she believed they had won; he refused to acknowledge any such victory. Baby had noback door; so he braved the cold and a wall of talk to knock on the one she did have. He clutchedthe red ribbon in his pocket for strength. Softly at first, then harder. At the last he bangedfuriously-disbelieving it could happen. That the door of a house with coloredpeople in it did not flyopen in his presence. He went to the window and wanted to cry. Sure enough, there they were, nota one of them heading for the door. Worrying his scrap of ribbon to shreds, the old man turned andwent down the steps. Now curiosity joined his shame and his debt. Two backs curled away fromhim as he looked in the window. One had a head he recognized; the other troubled him. He didn\u0027tknow her and didn\u0027t know anybody it could be. Nobody, but nobody visited that house.\n 　　After a disagreeable breakfast he went to see Ella and John to find out what they knew. Perhapsthere he could find out if, after all these years of clarity, he had misnamed himself and there wasyet another debt he owed. Born Joshua, he renamed himself when he handed over his wife to hismaster\u0027s son. Handed her over in the sense that he did not kill anybody, thereby himself, becausehis wife demanded he stay alive. Otherwise, she reasoned, where and to whom could she returnwhen the boy was through? With that gift, he decided that he didn\u0027t owe anybody anything.\n 　　Whatever his obligations were, that act paid them off. He thought it would make himrambunctious, renegade — a drunkard even, the debtlessness, and in a way it did. But there wasnothing to do with it. Work well; work poorly. Work a little; work not at all. Make sense; makenone. Sleep, wake up; like somebody, dislike others. It didn\u0027t seem much of a way to live and itbrought him no satisfaction. So he extended this debtlessness to other people by helping them payout and off whatever they owed in misery. Beaten runaways? He ferried them and rendered thempaid for; gave them their own bill of sale, so to speak. \"You paid it; now life owes you.\" And thereceipt, as it were, was a welcome door that he never had to knock on, like John and Ella\u0027s in frontof which he stood and said, \"Who in there?\" only once and she was pulling on the hinge.\n 　　\"where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.\"\"Oh, I been out.\" He took off his cap and massaged his scalp. \"Out where? Not by here.\" Ella hungtwo suits of underwear on a line behind the stove.\n 　　\"Was over to Baby Suggs\u0027 this morning.\"\"What you want in there?\" asked Ella. \"Somebody invite you in?\"\"That\u0027s Baby\u0027s kin. I don\u0027t need no invite to look after her people.\"\"Sth.\" Ella was unmoved. She had been Baby Suggs\u0027 friend and Sethe\u0027s too till the rough time.\n 　　Except for a nod at the carnival, she hadn\u0027t given Sethe the time of day.\n 　　\"Somebody new in there. A woman. Thought you might know who is she.\"\"Ain\u0027t no new Negroes in this town I don\u0027t know about,\" she said. \"what she look like? You surethat wasn\u0027t Denver?\"\"I know Denver. This girl\u0027s narrow.\"\"You sure?\"\"I know what I see.\"\"Might see anything at all at 124.\"\"True.\"\"Better ask Paul D,\" she said.\n 　　\"Can\u0027t locate him,\" said Stamp, which was the truth although his efforts to find Paul D had beenfeeble. He wasn\u0027t ready to confront the man whose life he had altered with his graveyardinformation.\n 　　\"He\u0027s sleeping in the church,\" said Ella.\n 　　\"The church!\" Stamp was shocked and very hurt.\n 　　\"Yeah. Asked Reverend Pike if he could stay in the cellar.\"\"It\u0027s cold as charity in there!\"\"I expect he knows that.\"\"What he do that for?\"\"Hes a touch proud, seem like.\"\"He don\u0027t have to do that! Any number\u0027ll take him in.\"Ella turned around to look at Stamp Paid. \"Can\u0027t nobody read minds long distance. All he have todo is ask somebody.\"\"Why? Why he have to ask? Can\u0027t nobody offer? What\u0027s going on? Since when a blackman cometo town have to sleep in a cellar like a dog?\"\"Unrile yourself, Stamp.\"\"Not me. I\u0027m going to stay riled till somebody gets some sense and leastway act like a Christian.\"\"It\u0027s only a few days he been there.\"\"Shouldn\u0027t be no days! You know all about it and don\u0027t give him a hand? That don\u0027t sound like you,Ella. Me and you been pulling coloredfolk out the water more\u0027n twenty years. Now you tell me youcan\u0027t offer a man a bed? A working man, too! A man what can pay his own way.\"\"He ask, I give him anything.\"\"Why\u0027s that necessary all of a sudden?\"\"I don\u0027t know him all that well.\"\"You know he\u0027s colored!\"\"Stamp, don\u0027t tear me up this morning. I don\u0027t feel like it.\" \"It\u0027s her, ain\u0027t it?\"\"Her who?\"\"Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don\u0027t want nothing to — \"\"Hold on. Don\u0027t jump if you can\u0027t see bottom.\"\"Girl, give it up. We been friends too long to act like this.\"\"Well, who can tell what all went on in there? Look here, I don\u0027t know who Sethe is or none of herpeople.\"\"What?!\"\"All I know is she married Baby Suggs\u0027 boy and I ain\u0027t sure I know that. Where is he, huh? Babynever laid eyes on her till John carried her to the door with a baby I strapped on her chest.\"\"I strapped that baby! And you way off the track with that wagon. Her children know who she waseven if you don\u0027t.\"\"So what? I ain\u0027t saying she wasn\u0027t their ma\u0027ammy, but who\u0027s to say they was Baby Suggs\u0027\n 　　grandchildren? How she get on board and her husband didn\u0027t? And tell me this, how she have thatbaby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman come out the trees and helped her. Shoot. Youbelieve that? A whitewoman? Well, I know what kind of white that was.\"\"Aw, no, Ella.\"\"Anything white floating around in the woods — -if it ain\u0027t got a shotgun, it\u0027s something I don\u0027twant no part of!\"\"You all was friends.\"\"Yeah, till she showed herself.\"\"Ella.\"\"I ain\u0027t got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.\"\"You in deep water, girl.\"\"Uh uh. I\u0027m on dry land and I\u0027m going to stay there. You the one wet.\"\"What\u0027s any of what you talking got to do with Paul D?\"\"What run him off? Tell me that.\"\"I run him off.\"\"You?\"\"I told him about — I showed him the newspaper, about the — what Sethe did. Read it to him. Heleft that very day.\"\"You didn\u0027t tell me that. I thought he knew.\"\"He didn\u0027t know nothing. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.\"\"He knew Baby Suggs?\"\"Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle too.\"\"And left when he found out what Sethe did?\"\"Look like he might have a place to stay after all.\"\"What you say casts a different light. I thought — \"But Stamp Paid knew what she thought.\n 　　\"You didn\u0027t come here asking about him,\" Ela said. \"You came about some new girl.\"\"That\u0027s so.\"\"Well, Paul D must know who she is. Or what she is.\"\"Your mind is loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.\"\"You know as well as I do that people who die bad don\u0027t stay in the ground.\"He couldn\u0027t deny it. Jesus Christ Himself didn\u0027t, so Stamp ate a piece of Ella\u0027s head cheese to showthere were no bad feelings and set out to find Paul D. He found him on the steps of HolyRedeemer, holding his wrists between his knees and looking red-eyed. Sawyer shouted at her whenshe entered the kitchen, but she just turned her back and reached for her apron. There was no entrynow. No crack or crevice available. She had taken pains to keep them out, but knew full well thatat any moment they could rock her, rip her from her moorings, send the birds twittering back intoher hair. Drain her mother\u0027s milk, they had already done. Divided her back into plant life — thattoo. Driven her fat-bellied into the woods — they had done that. All news of them was rot. Theybuttered Halle\u0027s face; gave Paul D iron to eat; crisped Sixo; hanged her own mother. She didn\u0027twant any more news about whitefolks; didn\u0027t want to know what Ella knew and John and StampPaid, about the world done up the way whitefolks loved it. All news of them should have stopped with the birds in her hair.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678/3767.html","bookId":82,"book":{"id":82,"title":"Beloved 宠儿","description":"简介： 你的爱太浓了！一个不可能重复的故事！！！ 女黑奴塞丝怀着身孕只身从肯塔基的奴隶庄园逃到俄亥俄的辛辛那提，奴隶主循踪追至；为了使儿女不再重复自己做奴隶的悲惨命运，她毅...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
