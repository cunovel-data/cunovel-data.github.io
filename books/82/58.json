{"id":2173,"no":58,"title":"Chapter 58","content":"Schoolteacher looks at him for a long time before he closes the door of the cabin. Carefully, helooks. Paul D does not look back. It is sprinkling now. A teasing August rain that raisesexpectations it cannot fill. He thinks he should have sung along. Loud something loud and rollingto go with Sixo\u0027s tune, but the words put him off — he didn\u0027t understand the words. Although itshouldn\u0027t have mattered because he understood the sound: hatred so loose it was juba. The warmsprinkle comes and goes, comes and goes. He thinks he hears sobbing that seems to come fromMrs. Garner\u0027s window, but it could be anything, anyone, even a she-cat making her yearningknown. Tired of holding his head up, he lets his chin rest on the collar and speculates on how hecan hobble over to the grate, boil a little water and throw in a handful of meal. That\u0027s what he isdoing when Sethe comes in, rain-wet and big-bellied, saying she is going to cut. She has just comeback from taking her children to the corn. The whites were not around. She couldn\u0027t find Halle. 　　Who was caught? Did Sixo get away? Paul A? 　　He tells her what he knows: Sixo is dead; the Thirty-Mile Woman ran, and he doesn\u0027t know whathappened to Paul A or Halle. \"Where could he be?\" she asks. 　　Paul D shrugs because he can\u0027t shake his head. 　　\"You saw Sixo die? You sure?\"\"I\u0027m sure.\"\"Was he woke when it happened? Did he see it coming?\"\"He was woke. Woke and laughing.\"\"Sixo laughed?\"\"You should have heard him, Sethe.\"Sethe\u0027s dress steams before the little fire over which he is boiling water. It is hard to move aboutwith shackled ankles and the neck jewelry embarrasses him. In his shame he avoids her eyes, butwhen he doesn\u0027t he sees only black in them — no whites. She says she is going, and he thinks shewill never make it to the gate, but he doesn\u0027t dissuade her. He knows he will never see her again,and right then and there his heart stopped. 　　The pupils must have taken her to the barn for sport right afterward, and when she told Mrs. 　　Garner, they took down the cowhide. 　　Who in hell or on this earth would have thought that she would cut anyway? They must havebelieved, what with her belly and her back, that she wasn\u0027t going anywhere. He wasn\u0027t surprised tolearn that they had tracked her down in Cincinnati, because, when he thought about it now, herprice was greater than his; property that reproduced itself without cost. 　　Remembering his own price, down to the cent, that schoolteacher was able to get for him, hewondered what Sethe\u0027s would have been. What had Baby Suggs\u0027 been? How much did Halle owe,still, besides his labor? What did Mrs. Garner get for Paul F? More than nine hundred dollars? 　　How much more? Ten dollars? Twenty? Schoolteacher would know. He knew the worth ofeverything. It accounted for the real sorrow in his voice when he pronounced Sixo unsuitable. Whocould be fooled into buying a singing nigger with a gun ? Shouting Seven-O! Seven-O! becausehis Thirty-Mile Woman got away with his blossoming seed. What a laugh. So rippling and full ofglee it put out the fire. And it was Sixo\u0027s laughter that was on his mind, not the bit in his mouth,when they hitched him to the buckboard. Then he saw Halle, then the rooster, smiling as if to say,You ain\u0027t seen nothing yet. How could a rooster know about Alfred, Georgia? 　　\"HOWDY.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678/3781.html","bookId":82,"book":{"id":82,"title":"Beloved 宠儿","description":"简介： 你的爱太浓了！一个不可能重复的故事！！！ 女黑奴塞丝怀着身孕只身从肯塔基的奴隶庄园逃到俄亥俄的辛辛那提，奴隶主循踪追至；为了使儿女不再重复自己做奴隶的悲惨命运，她毅...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
