{"id":2185,"no":70,"title":"Chapter 70","content":"Bare feet and chamomile sap. 　　Took off my shoes; took off my hat. 　　Bare feet and chamomile sap,Gimme back my shoes; gimme back my hat. 　　Lay my head on a potato sack,Devil sneak up behind my back. 　　Steam engine got a lonesome whine;Love that woman till you go stone blind. 　　Stone blind; stone blind. 　　Sweet Home gal make you lose your mind. 　　HIS COMING is the reverse route of his going. First the cold house,the storeroom, then thekitchen before he tackles the beds. Here Boy, feeble and shedding his coat in patches, is asleep bythe pump, so Paul D knows Beloved is truly gone. Disappeared, some say, exploded right before their eyes. Ella is not so sure. \"Maybe,\" she says, \"maybe not. Could be hiding in the trees waitingfor another chance.\" But when Paul D sees the ancient dog, eighteen years if a day, he is certain124 is clear of her. But he opens the door to the cold house halfway expecting to hear her. \"Touchme. Touch me. On the inside part and call me my name.\"There is the pallet spread with old newspapers gnawed at the edges by mice. The lard can. Thepotato sacks too, but empty now, they lie on the dirt floor in heaps. In daylight he can\u0027t imagine itin darkness with moonlight seeping through the cracks. Nor the desire that drowned him there andforced him to struggle up, up into that girl like she was the clear air at the top of the sea. Couplingwith her wasn\u0027t even fun. It was more like a brainless urge to stay alive. 　　Each time she came, pulled up her skirts, a life hunger overwhelmed him and he had no morecontrol over it than over his lungs. And afterward, beached and gobbling air, in the midst ofrepulsion and personal shame, he was thankful too for having been escorted to some ocean-deepplace he once belonged to. 　　Sifting daylight dissolves the memory, turns it into dust motes floating in light. Paul D shuts thedoor. He looks toward the house and, surprisingly, it does not look back at him. Unloaded, 124 isjust another weathered house needing repair. Quiet, just as Stamp Paid said. 　　\"Used to be voices all round that place. Quiet, now,\" Stamp said. 　　\"I been past it a few times and I can\u0027t hear a thing. Chastened, I reckon, \u0027cause Mr. Bodwin say heselling it soon\u0027s he can.\"\"That the name of the one she tried to stab? That one?\"\"Yep. His sister say it\u0027s full of trouble. Told Janey she was going to get rid of it.\"\"And him?\" asked Paul D. 　　\"Janey say he against it but won\u0027t stop it.\"\"Who they think want a house out there? Anybody got the money don\u0027t want to live out there.\"\"Beats me,\" Stamp answered. \"It\u0027ll be a spell, I guess, before it get took off his hands.\"\"He don\u0027t plan on taking her to the law?\"\"Don\u0027t seem like it. Janey say all he wants to know is who was the naked blackwoman standing onthe porch. He was looking at her so hard he didn\u0027t notice what Sethe was up to. All he saw wassome coloredwomen fighting. He thought Sethe was after one of them, Janey say.\"\"Janey tell him any different?\"\"No. She say she so glad her boss ain\u0027t dead. If Ella hadn\u0027t clipped her, she say she would have. 　　Scared her to death have that woman kill her boss. She and Denver be looking for a job.\"\"Who Janey tell him the naked woman was?\"\"Told him she didn\u0027t see none.\"\"You believe they saw it?\"\"Well, they saw something. I trust Ella anyway, and she say she looked it in the eye. It wasstanding right next to Sethe. But from the way they describe it, don\u0027t seem like it was the girl I sawin there. 　　The girl I saw was narrow. This one was big. She say they was holding hands and Sethe lookedlike a little girl beside it.\"\"Little girl with a ice pick. How close she get to him?\"\"Right up on him, they say. Before Denver and them grabbed her and Ella put her fist in her jaw.\"\"He got to know Sethe was after him. He got to.\"\"Maybe. I don\u0027t know. If he did think it, I reckon he decided not to. That be just like him, too. He\u0027ssomebody never turned us down. 　　Steady as a rock. I tell you something, if she had got to him, it\u0027d be the worst thing in the world forus. You know, don\u0027t you, he\u0027s the main one kept Sethe from the gallows in the first place.\"\"Yeah. Damn. That woman is crazy. Crazy.\"\"Yeah, well, ain\u0027t we all?\"They laughed then. A rusty chuckle at first and then more, louder and louder until Stamp took outhis pocket handkerchief and wiped his eyes while Paul D pressed the heel of his hand in his own. 　　As the neither one had witnessed took shape before them, its seriousness and itsembarrassment (scene) made them shake with laughter. 　　\"Every time a whiteman come to the door she got to kill somebody?\"\"For all she know, the man could be coming for the rent.\"\"Good thing they don\u0027t deliver mail out that way.\"\"Wouldn\u0027t nobody get no letter.\"\"Except the postman.\"\"Be a mighty hard message.\"\"And his last.\"When their laughter was spent, they took deep breaths and shook their heads. 　　\"And he still going to let Denver spend the night in his house? 　　Ha!\"\"Aw no. Hey. Lay off Denver, Paul D. That\u0027s my heart. I\u0027m proud of that girl. She was the first onewrestle her mother down. Before anybody knew what the devil was going on.\"\"She saved his life then, you could say.\"\"You could. You could,\" said Stamp, thinking suddenly of the leap, the wide swing and snatch ofhis arm as he rescued the little curly-headed baby from within inches of a split skull. \"I\u0027m proud ofher. She turning out fine. Fine.\"It was true. Paul D saw her the next morning when he was on his way to work and she was leavinghers. Thinner, steady in the eyes, she looked more like Halle than ever. 　　She was the first to smile. \"Good morning, Mr. D.\"\"Well, it is now.\" Her smile, no longer the sneer he remembered, had welcome in it and strongtraces of Sethe\u0027s mouth. Paul D touchedhis cap. \"How you getting along?\"\"Don\u0027t pay to complain.\"\"You on your way home?\"She said no. She had heard about an afternoon job at the shirt factory. She hoped that with hernight work at the Bodwins\u0027 and another one, she could put away something and help her mothertoo. 　　When he asked her if they treated her all right over there, she said more than all right. MissBodwin taught her stuff. He asked her what stuff and she laughed and said book stuff. \"She says Imight go to Oberlin. She\u0027s experimenting on me.\" And he didn\u0027t say, \"Watch out. Watch out. 　　Nothing in the world more dangerous than a white schoolteacher.\" Instead he nodded and asked the question he wanted to. 　　\"Your mother all right?\"\"No,\" said Denver. \"No. No, not a bit all right.\"\"You think I should stop by? Would she welcome it?\"\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Denver. \"I think I\u0027ve lost my mother, Paul D.\"They were both silent for a moment and then he said, \"Uh, that girl. You know. Beloved?\"\"Yes?\"\"You think she sure \u0027nough your sister?\"Denver looked at her shoes. \"At times. At times I think she was — more.\" She fiddled with hershirtwaist, rubbing a spot of something.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678/3793.html","bookId":82,"book":{"id":82,"title":"Beloved 宠儿","description":"简介： 你的爱太浓了！一个不可能重复的故事！！！ 女黑奴塞丝怀着身孕只身从肯塔基的奴隶庄园逃到俄亥俄的辛辛那提，奴隶主循踪追至；为了使儿女不再重复自己做奴隶的悲惨命运，她毅...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
