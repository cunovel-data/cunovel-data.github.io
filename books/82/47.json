Like, a feature of summer is heat. A characteristic is a feature. A thing that\u0027s natural to athing.\"\"Can you have more than one?\"\"You can have quite a few. You know.

Me, you andyour daddy slept by the wall. The night after I heard why schoolteacher measured me, I had troublesleeping. When Halle came in I asked him what he thought about schoolteacher. He said therewasn\u0027t nothing to think about. Said, He\u0027s white, ain\u0027t he? I said, But I mean is he like Mr. Garner?\\n\\n 　　\"What you want to know, Sethe?\"\"Him and her,\" I said, \"they ain\u0027t like the whites I seen before.

How he going get it?\"\"No. That\u0027s one question. There\u0027s one more.\"\"What\u0027s that?\"He leaned up and turned over, touching my cheek with his knuckles. \"The question now is, Who\u0027sgoing buy you out? Or me? Or her?\" He pointed over to where you was laying.\\n\\n 　　\"What?\"\"If all my labor is Sweet Home, including the extra, what I got left to sell?\"He turned over then and went back to sleep and I thought I wouldn\u0027t but I did too for a while.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678/3770.html","bookId":82,"book":{"id":82,"title":"Beloved 宠儿","description":"简介： 你的爱太浓了！一个不可能重复的故事！！！ 女黑奴塞丝怀着身孕只身从肯塔基的奴隶庄园逃到俄亥俄的辛辛那提，奴隶主循踪追至；为了使儿女不再重复自己做奴隶的悲惨命运，她毅...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/678","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
