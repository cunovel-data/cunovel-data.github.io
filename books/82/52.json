{"id":2167,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 52","content":"The secret house. When she died I went there. Ma\u0027am wouldn\u0027t let me go outside in the yard andeat with the others. We stayed inside. That hurt. I know Grandma Baby would have liked the partyand the people who came to it, because she got low not seeing anybody or going anywhere — justgrieving and thinking about colors and how she made a mistake. That what she thought about whatthe heart and the body could do was wrong. The whitepeople came anyway. In her yard. She haddone everything right and they came in her yard anyway. And she didn\u0027t know what to think. Allshe had left was her heart and they busted it so even the War couldn\u0027t rouse her. 　　She told me all my daddy\u0027s things. How hard he worked to buy her. After the cake was ruined andthe ironed clothes all messed up, and after I heard my sister crawling up the stairs to get back toher bed, she told me my things too. That I was charmed. My birth was and I got saved all the time. 　　And that I shouldn\u0027t be afraid of the ghost. It wouldn\u0027t harm me because I tasted its blood whenMa\u0027am nursed me. She said the ghost was after Ma\u0027am and her too for not doing anything to stop it. 　　But it would never hurt me. I just had to watch out for it because it was a greedy ghost and neededa lot of love, which was only natural, considering. And I do. Love her. I do. She played with meand always came to be with me whenever I needed her. She\u0027s mine, Beloved. She\u0027s mine. 　　I AM and she is mine. I see her take flowers away from leaves she puts them in a round basket theleaves are not for her she fills the basket she opens the grass I would help her but the clouds are inthe way how can I say things that are pictures I am not separate from her there is no place where Istop her face is my own and I want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at ittoo a hot thing All of it is now it is always now there will never be a time when I am not crouchingand watching others who are crouching too I am always crouching the man on my face is dead hisface is not mine his mouth smells sweet but his eyes are locked some who eat nasty themselves Ido not eat the men without skin bring us their morning water to drink we have none at night Icannot see the dead man on my face daylight comes through the cracks and I can see his locked eyes I am not big small rats do not wait for us to sleep someone is thrashing but there is no room todo it in if we had more to drink we could make tears we cannot make sweat or morning water sothe men without skin bring us theirs one time they bring us sweet rocks to suck we are all trying toleave our bodies behind the man on my face
