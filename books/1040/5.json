{"id":37466,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V","content":"The day following I was strangely depressed. I had run the gantlet of hope and doubt. Jacqueline’s various moods had baffled me. And the duke–frankly, I feared him. Jacqueline had so obviously admired him. He stood for the very qualities that I lacked. The glamour of his name, the luxurious environment he scorned so vigorously, his verve, and, above all, his alliance with Mrs. Gordon, made him a formidable rival. For that Mrs. Gordon, in some subtle way, had already come to a vague understanding with him, I did not doubt. Two letters were on the tray that brought in my morning coffee. One from Jacqueline; the other from her brother. They called to me in quite different directions. Jacqueline to her side; the brother to his assistance in Rome. The young fool was in trouble–trouble serious enough to demand the assistance of one who had influence with the authorities. I happened to fill that position. I must go to his aid. In Jacqueline’s letter I fancied I read a tenderness that was altogether new and delightful. 50It was no longer the reserved Jacqueline that spoke. There was a delightful shyness, but through the shyness spoke the woman who dared to be bold for the man she loved. She wished me to call at once. We would discuss the book together. And she had invited St. Hilary and myself to dinner that evening. After I had left them yesterday he had hinted at a wonderful story about the old clock. She would make him talk. I should have copy for one of my legends at least. But I could not hesitate as to my destination. For, in assisting her brother, I would be doing Jacqueline a favor. Unfortunately, I could not tell her why I had to leave Venice so peremptorily. Neither she nor her aunt must know that the youngster had made an ass of himself. I wrote her merely that an affair of importance had called me to Rome. I caught the first train south. Ten days passed before I sniffed once more the pungent odor of the lagoons. There had been complications and delays; and in his remorse the boy had had a touch of Roman fever. I could not leave him like that. A letter from Jacqueline awaited me. It had arrived only a day or two before. Her annoyance at my sudden flight from Venice was obvious. 51She regretted my absence at her dinner, but I had not missed much. St. Hilary had refused to talk. Perhaps there was really no legend, after all. And, indeed, when one came to think over the matter calmly, was it worth while attempting to discover one? And was I really interested in writing the book–that is, for its own sake? I ought to be well assured of that. She was afraid she would not see me again for the present. They were to leave almost immediately for Bellagio. I walked over to my window. I was bitterly hurt and disappointed. Venice was storm-swept. The Giudecca, deserted, was lashed by wind and rain. The ships, moored near the Salute, tossed and swayed at their anchors. The goddess over the customs-house spun about on her golden ball and vainly tried to shield herself behind her flimsy veil. The brightness and glory of Venice had vanished as in a dream. The palaces, ivory and gold in the sunlight, looked sodden and decayed in the gloom, like an old woman deprived of her rouge-pot and powder. Venice, in short, was a painting, a masterpiece, if you wish, which the mischievous fist of some mawkish infant had smeared and smudged. The pigeons, the cafés, the gondolas–they are the creatures of the sun. To-day the pigeons were huddled under the Dome of the 52Salute; the cafés deserted; the gondolas covered with tarpaulin. But as I looked, a gondola, rowed by two oarsmen, emerged from the rain and fog. It was headed directly for the landing outside my windows. It touched the steps. The old gransieri, shivering in an archway, pattered across the quay with his hook. The passenger leaped ashore. It was St. Hilary. And in this weather! I drew the portière. I walked over to the mantel and felt for a match to light the gas, for it was growing late. As I struck it, half a dozen visiting-cards caught my eye–eight, to be quite precise. One of the eight was that of the Duke da Sestos. What humble attraction had I for the noble gentleman? The seven others bore the name of St. Hilary. Seven calls in ten days! I looked at them thoughtfully. And then–why, I have no idea–I thought of the mysterious clock that Mrs. Gordon had entrusted to my care, and that I had left with a jeweler on the Piazza to see if it was quite beyond repair. It would be just as well to say nothing of that to the dealer. I was curious to know precisely the fascination that the old timepiece had for him. “I was longing for some one to talk to. Just returned from a little trip to Rome. What’s the news?” 53“Oh, I have just dropped in for a smoke. Where’s your whisky? I am drenched through. The felsa of that confounded gondola leaked.” I caught the swift glance that took in every detail of my room. I waved my hand to the side-board. “Help yourself. I’ll join you presently, when I have slipped into a bath-robe. You’ll find the cigarettes by the whisky.” I stepped into my room. I heard the fizz of the siphon. I caught the fumes of his cigarette. I heard the creak of a wicker-chair as he threw himself into it. Then there was silence. I was about to rejoin him, when I happened to look into my mirror. St. Hilary was reflected in it, and he was opening a coat-closet. I whistled noisily, and put my eye to a crack in the door. He was looking into a cabinet. Then he pulled aside the portière that hid the deep recess of the window. Another puzzled glance about the room, and he sank noiselessly into the chair. It was not difficult to put two and two together. He was looking for Mrs. Gordon’s clock. Well, he should satisfy himself thoroughly that it was not on my premises. Then I would wait for his next move. I entered my sitting-room, still whistling. “Just a word to my man, and I’m ready for 54our smoke,” I said, and went into the sala. I banged the door after me, but took pains to leave it carefully ajar. It was as I thought. He promptly slipped into my bedroom. I waited considerately for him to resume his seat before joining him. “Well, indefatigable peerer and pryer for the rare and odd, what is the news of the past ten days?” I asked, reaching for the Scotch. I knew he was watching me closely. The nouns were a trifle suggestive. “No news so far as I know. I have been buried in the palazzo of the duke, making an inventory of things. Interesting old palace, eh?” I nodded, and blew a cloud of cigarette-smoke into the air. “Nice chap, the duke.” I nodded again. “Extremely gallant to the ladies.” Again I nodded, but without much enthusiasm. “Rather pretty compliment, his giving them those souvenirs.” “No one but an Italian would have thought of it.” “But I must say I was disgusted at the poor taste of the ladies.” “Why so?” “My dear fellow, did you observe that bowl of 55majolica? Or that superb cloisonné Kioto vase? With carved ivories galore and a plaque of della Robbia to choose from, and to pick out a silly timepiece.” “Ah, yes,” I remarked dryly, “you had an eye on that clock yourself, hadn’t you?” “Tut, tut, I have an eye on everything that is useless and odd. By the way, she asked you to keep it for her. I should like to have a look at it. Trot it out, my boy.” I gazed into St. Hilary’s innocent blue eyes, and laughed quietly. “The other day, in Rome,” I said slowly, “I met on the street a certain Captain Villari. He’s as poor as the proverbial mouse, and an acquaintance. He asked me to go to the opera with him, I did not refuse, though the invitation, coming from him, surprised me. And the inevitable happened, of course. At the very box-office, he discovered with cries of consternation that he had left all his money in his other uniform. Might he dare, would I think it too presuming, if he asked me for the loan of ten lire until to-morrow? “I assured him with all the warmth in the world that it would be a privilege, I put my hand in my pocket to oblige him. Accidenti! Was there ever such devilish luck! I had left my money in my morning clothes! 56“We looked at each other half a minute; then we embraced with laughter. It was such an odd coincidence. And so we went our separate ways, quite good-naturedly. He knew I was lying. I knew he had been lying. What do you think of my story?” “What has that story to do with an old timepiece?” he blustered. I leaned forward and tapped him on the knee. “Only this, my crafty dealer in antiquities. You, as well as my captain, are too crafty by half. You know the timepiece is not in these rooms, just as well as I do myself.” “I don’t understand you,” he fumed. “No? Then what were you looking for a minute or two ago? In that cabinet, behind the portière there? By Jove, you had the impertinence to lift the cover of my trunk in the bedroom.” If I had expected him to show shame or confusion, I was much mistaken. He stared at me a moment. Then he threw back his head and laughed. “It wasn’t nice of me, I confess,” he said coolly. “I should have acted with my customary frankness, and have asked to see it first.” “I think it would have been the better way. As to this customary frankness of yours, you 57guard that virtue so closely that I am a stranger to it.” “Very well, I’ll give you an instance of it. Now that my cards are on the table, what have you done with the clock?” “Is that what you call being frank? I fail to see those cards of yours on the table even now. Play fair, St. Hilary.” “I don’t understand you,” he said, and his neck took on a purple tinge. “You understand me perfectly. Just as my captain did. And I have both eyes and ears. Let me remind you, in the first place, you were perfectly well aware that the clock was in the palace. You looked for it deliberately, but slyly. When I was curious in my turn, you were hardly pleased. You pooh-poohed the chamber. You made fun of the clock. You blew out the candle promptly that no one might examine it. When Mrs. Gordon insisted on doing so, you vainly attempted to divert her interest. As a last resort, you tried to make it impossible for her to accept it by asserting that it was an antique of great value. Don’t you think that was in extremely bad taste?” “My dear fellow, desperate cases require desperate remedies.” “Ah, then you confess that you were even desperately 58anxious to have the clock? Why should you deny it? There is nothing to be ashamed of. Your eight calls have made me quite certain of that, and the fact that you played the spy, looking into my trunk just now.” St. Hilary laughed, a little too boisterously. “Good, good!” he cried. “I confess I didn’t credit my dear dilettante with quite so observing an eye. And if I were to confess that this old clock interests me beyond belief, why should you not satisfy my curiosity? Have you any interest in it? An interest that conflicts with mine, for instance?” and he looked at me curiously. “It is quite possible,” I answered calmly. “And this interest really conflicts with mine?” “Why not?” I answered, smiling at him. “Then I see no reason why I should not go my way and you yours.” He picked up his hat in high dudgeon and walked toward the door. “Nor do I,” I answered, reaching for a cigar. “However, let me remind you that I still have the clock.” It may seem strange and unreasonable that I should have assumed so cautious a tone with the dealer. My interest in the clock was simply that I wished to write up the legend connected with it, if legend there was. But I browbeat him 59to punish him. He had not come to me frankly and openly. He had spied on me and he had lied to me. The penalty for that must be a full confession as to why he attached such tremendous importance to this clock. He stood at the door. His eyes devoured my face with that same searching glance that had so startled me on the Piazza a few days before. “Trust me, St. Hilary,” I said very quietly. “I am not a man to betray a confidence–certainly not the confidence of a friend like you. And it is barely possible I may help you.” “I have thought that, too,” he said, and hesitated. “Then why not?” “Because you are too much of the dilettante, the dreamer,” he said angrily. “Bah, I need a man like the Duke da Sestos–a man that has grit and resource–who can even be unscrupulous on occasion–yes, look into a friend’s trunk and not feel too squeamish. I do need help; but could you go to extreme ends with me patiently and relentlessly? You hardly fill the bill, Hume.” He had quoted almost Jacqueline’s words. He could have said nothing that would have touched me so deeply. I answered him impetuously: 60“St. Hilary, do you forget that it was you who made me a dreamer? It is you who first preached to me impossible ideals of beauty and art. And when I failed to reach those ideals, you laughed at me; you consoled me with sneers. If I had not a soul to appreciate art and beauty, there was still the sensuous Venice for me to enjoy. And so, month by month, I have sunk into the slough of materialism, until, at last, it is almost too late for me to shake myself free. First, the woman I love flaunts at the dilettante, and then it is my friend.” He stared at me; then, rising, he walked over to where I sat and put his hand on my shoulder. “What do you mean–that the woman you love has flaunted you?” I told him quite simply. He passed his hand across his forehead. “My dear, dear Hume,” he said affectionately, “forgive me. Love is a thing dead and past for me. I am in the sere leaf and brown. I had forgotten that love might come into your life. So your interest in the clock, after all, is simply that you wish to write a legend about it?” “Yes.” “Listen to me. Hume. I have a quest that demands patience, courage, faith, a will that is 61relentless. If I shared it with you, could you bring to it these qualities?” “Try me,” I said firmly. “If it is a task that demands action, and if it concerns this clock, I am with you heart and soul.” “It does concern the clock. But it is a hundred-to-one shot, with the odds all against us. If you fail, at least you will have your legend. If you succeed, you will share equally with myself. I have needed one for this quest in whose honesty I could have absolute faith. I have thought of you, but only to mistrust you. If I trust you now, will you follow where I shall lead?” “Try me,” I said again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1817/52765.html","bookId":1040,"book":{"id":1040,"title":"The Clock and the Key","description":"简介： Our gondola, far out on the lagoon, hardly moved.
