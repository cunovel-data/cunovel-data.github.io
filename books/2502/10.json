{"id":106675,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"In spite of the blustery storm that rollicked over Roma, the celebration of Saturnalia was almost unimpeded; from the gaudy extravagance of the Emperor\u0027s palace to the festive streets of the lupanar the city was alive with banquets and entertainment; even a few determined Romans were in the streets, stopping at all the major temples of the city to leave offerings for the gods and goddesses, and incense for the Vestal Virgins to burn for Roma and Romans. Gaiety offset the rattling rain, and through all but the meanest streets songs echoed merrily and cries of good wishes rang in counterpoint to the wind. Even the Watchmen and the Urban Guard took part in the festivities, enjoying drink and food at the houses of the patrician nobles on the Palatinus and Capitolinus hills instead of patrolling the rainy streets. The house of Septimus Desiderius Vulpius was no exception to this joyousness: oil-lamps, torches, and incense-scented braziers lent their lights and perfumes to the main dining room, and to the reception room beyond where jugglers and dancers were performing unusual feats for the evening\u0027s guests to the accompaniment of a group of musicians playing popular tunes and occasional anthems to Saturn. Slaves in special holiday tunicae made their way through the attendees, bearing trays of rare, succulent appetizers and amphorae of even rarer wines. The holocaust kept the air channels under the floors so warm that where rain spattered in at the door, little wraiths of steam rose from the evaporating water, promising an evening of welcome heat for the guests. In the alcove next to the front door, before the altar to the lares, Vulpius himself offered the traditional oranges and lemons to all, and his wife, Filomena Dionesia Crassens, Domina Vulpius, held out the plate of small loaves of bread studded with nuts, as was expected for Saturnalia in such a fine house as this one; both of them wore wreaths of gold on their heads, and their clothing was bright yellow, to mark the turn of the year from dark to light again. With slaves to escort them, all the guests were led into the house-men to the dining room, women to the withdrawing room. Only when the brass bell sounded for the convivium to begin did Vulpius and his wife forsake their positions near the vestibule and enter the dining room, preceded by six slaves holding up the first platters of the evening\u0027s food: small buns stuffed with spiced meats and preserved fruits, and plates of anchovies preserved in olive oil and garlic. \"Each of you knows your place,\" said Vulpius, grinning at his friends, and indicating the waiting couches, arranged in two U-formations of nine couches apiece, the opening of the U\u0027s facing each other; two long, broad tables were set in the middle of both U\u0027s, and a tall, brass-topped table occupied the opening between the two U\u0027s, on which stood great vessels of wine. \"But for you,\" he added to Sanct-Franciscus, who stood to one side, very grand in a short silken dalmatica of dark red, embroidered in black and silver, over black Persian bracae that were gathered with bands of silver ribbon at the ankles. He had added his personal sigil-a winged eclipse-as a pendant on a silver hammered-link collar, and wore a large ruby set in silver on the first finger of his left hand. Upon his arrival, Sanct-Franciscus had presented Vulpius with a pair of alabaster goblets, one of which Vulpius now held up as he pointed. \"Most elegant; many thanks, and good fortune in the year ahead. If you will take the couch there? nearest the door to the reception room?\" \"As you wish,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, noticing that fewer than half the couches were occupied. \"I have told the slaves not to offer you food, and I will explain that your customs forbid you to dine with us; some of my guests may remark upon your abstinence, but I assume you are used to that, since it is your custom to dine in private,\" Vulpius said cordially, nodding a greeting to Pius Verus Lucillius, who had just stretched out on his couch, across from Sanct-Franciscus, his white-and-wine-red toga virilis making graceful folds about him, his jewelstudded bracelets glowing in the rich light. \"You are among friends here, Sanct-Franciscus, and you need not fear us.\" He clapped Sanct-Franciscus on the shoulder for good measure. \"Thank you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, and went to sit down, though unlike the Romans, he did not recline, but sat high up on the couch, his lower back supported by the rest that was intended for shoulders and elbows. \"Delphinius Ambrosius Junian,\" Vulpius called out to the highest-ranking Roman in the room. \"Let you name the first delight of the evening.\" Junian, an abdominous fellow with a high-colored complexion and the beginning of pendulous jowls, dressed in an extravagant toga of pale-lavender silk and wearing a great many golden bracelets, sat up on his couch. \"Let all the women be brought in to dine! Bring forth the women!\" It was the usual first delight, and it was greeted with enthusiastic shouts. Vulpius signaled his steward and handed him the alabaster goblet. \"My wife has the other,\" he said, and added more loudly, \"No guest is to be denied the satisfaction of his wishes; for tonight, our guests live as gods, and their desires are paramount. Do as you are commanded.\" He swung his arm in a gesture of anticipation and welcome, his yellow toga making him seem to glow. The steward ducked his head and went to collect the second goblet and to throw open the door at the back of the dining room, revealing the withdrawing room where the women guests and a few professional female entertainers were waiting. The musicians in the reception room struck up a fanfare of sorts to welcome them to the banquet, and with this to accompany them, the women entered the dining room, ready to begin the celebration. All were dressed in their newest finery, for it was good luck to celebrate the new year in fine, new clothes. Watching them, Sanct-Franciscus could see the first signs of exhaustion, a mark of the end of Saturnalia. Five days of unrelenting festivities were taking their toll. He watched the women go to their couches, most of them across from their husbands; two of the women who were engaged for the evening selected the unoccupied couches for themselves. As host, Vulpius occupied the center couch of the U nearest the reception room while his wife occupied the center couch of the U nearest the withdrawing room, all in strict accord with Roman custom. Once the guests were settled, a group of slaves entered the dining room, one for each guest, whose job it would be to assist the guests through the banquet as well as provide any additional amusements the guest might require. All of the slaves were dressed in knee-length, pleated tunicae of fine, white wool, garments that would serve them for all festive occasions in the year to come. \"Proffer the first dishes; let the convivium commence,\" Vulpius ordered. \"And fill the goblets with wine.\" He held up his own silver goblet; all his guests would take home their silver goblets as gifts. From his post at the dining room door, Leontius, the Vulpius\u0027 steward, signaled the personal slaves to comply, while he, himself, prepared to summon the next course to the diners as soon as the first was completed. \"How delightful all this is,\" exclaimed Romulus Sabinus Savinus as his evening\u0027s slave held out his goblet. \"Doubly delightful for us, to end the year among such good friends,\" said Dionesia, and poured out a small amount of wine from her goblet onto the floor as token offering to Saturn and Janus, both of whom were the gods honored in these festivities; most of the guests did the same, and a sudden aroma of wine filled the air as the warm floors turned the red liquid to thin trails of white steam. \"The libation has been made,\" Junian cried out before popping one of the stuffed buns into his mouth. \"The glory of the Emperor,\" called out Oliverus Stephanus Tacitus Caio, spilling a generous amount of wine in honor of Heliogabalus. The others echoed this, but with less enthusiasm, and Savinus coughed. \"Is he keeping Saturnalia at all?\" Caio laughed. \"Better than most. He has had feasts and entertainments from the first night until now, each more extravagant than the last. They say he has had a fountain built that pours four kinds of wine, and a device that can turn four stuffed boars over a fire-pit at the same time. His slaves are handsome young men, dressed in tunicae of cloth-of-gold. Those fortunate enough to be invited to be his guests are given golden plates to take home.\" \"But he slights the Vestal Virgins,\" said Dionesia, concerned at this impropriety. \"His mother has refused to visit them, and Heliogabalus himself has only summoned them to him; he will not go to them.\" \"Very unseemly,\" said Junian. \"Well, he\u0027s foreign; he doesn\u0027t yet understand how we do things in Roma,\" said Caio, then glanced in Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 direction. \"I mean no offense to you, of course.\" He took an anchovy and thumbed it into his mouth, chewing vigorously. \"Of course,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"He needs time to learn our ways,\" Caio went on, still chewing. \"We\u0027ve offered libations to his glory,\" said Vulpius, raising his voice to be heard over the increasing buzz of conversation. \"That we have,\" said Junius, and held out his goblet to his slave to be refilled. \"Heliogabalus has been made Caesar, and we, as Romans, must hail him Emperor.\" This from Publicus Maximus Titanius Pereginus, who had attended an earlier celebration and whose face was already ruddy from wine; his toga was beginning to slip from his shoulder. Caio laughed, not quite pleasantly. \"So loyal you are?\" \"As loyal as you,\" said Peregrinus, a hint of belligerence in his tone. \"Ave Caesar, then,\" said Lucillius, as if to put an end to the wrangling. \"He is just a youth,\" Peregrinus said in defense of the Emperor. \"Have patience. In time he will wean himself away from his mother\u0027s influence, and we shall discover what manner-\" \"Let us forsake politics for tonight,\" said Parthenia Orela Tallonus, Domina Caio, looking uncomfortable in her stola and palla of embroidered linen, for her pregnancy was advanced and moving had become awkward. \"My wife has expressed a wish: that we banish talk of politics,\" Caio said in a tone that suggested that this had been a bone of contention with them before. \"And I endorse it,\" said Dionesia. \"You men can discuss the affairs of the Empire in the morning, when the new year dawns; tonight is only the eve of the nine hundred seventy-second Year of the City, and Saturn still reigns: Jove and Minerva will rule in the morning, and Janus, as well. Tonight we sample all the delights that flesh can know, without a care for what is to come. For tonight, we are to celebrate the time that is past, and the past is beyond our influence. Let us give no time to that which is beyond this moment\u0027s grasp.\" There were a few shouts of agreement, and Bonar Datus Fabricius crowed like a cock at sunrise. \"Let each of you amuse yourself; take pleasure of the table and the slaves brought to you for your delectation,\" said Vulpius. \"As the Olympians do,\" shouted Junian. \"So it shall be for tonight,\" Vulpius declared, and signaled the entertainers to rest while the musicians played. \"You will be kept busy later, never fear,\" he promised the entertainers. One of the musicians had a small lyre from Cappodocia, and looking at it, Sanct-Franciscus had a brief, intense recollection of Tishtry, standing on her hands on the front of her racing quadriga before flipping onto the back of her favorite horse, to ride, standing, around the end of the spina in the Circus Maximus; she had bought her family\u0027s freedom with her performing before she died the True Death on the sands. He looked away and caught Lillis Cecania Lenius, Domina Fabricius, staring at him. \"Domina,\" he acknowledged, ducking his head. \"I have heard much about you,\" said Cecania, offering him a lupine smile; she was almost as tall as Sanct-Franciscus, and richly dressed in gold-shot silk; her russet hair was in an elaborate arrangement of ordered curls and golden ribbons. \"So I am curious.\" She ran the tip of her tongue over her parted lips. \"Perhaps later you will ease my curiosity?\" \"Why would that be? That you are curious?\" Sant-Franciscus asked politely. \"Because I have many questions about you.\" She caught her lower lip in her teeth and smiled. \"I hope you are all I have heard you are.\" \"You must not believe everything you hear of me, or of anyone,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, his manner gracious but reserved; he read avidity in her eyes that had no hint of generosity. \"This is no night for gravitas, old Roman virtue though it may be,\" she admonished him provocatively. \"Leave dignity behind on this last night of the year. Be willing to surrender to chance.\" \"As Romans do?\" he suggested. \"Yes. As we do. You are our guest, you must share our-\" She let her hand slide negligently down to her golden-chain belt. \"A most tempting invitation, and were I of your blood, I would be unable to resist you, lovely as you are. But, alas, I am no longer a prince of my people, and illustriata are too exalted for me,\" Sanct-Franciscus said, aware that this woman might find his appetites not to her liking; certainly the other guests would be appalled. \"Modest? Afraid of my husband\u0027s claim on me?\" she teased, giving her husband an indulgent look. \"I do not deprive him of his amusements, nor does he keep me from mine.\" \"Not so much modest as careful, as a foreigner is expected to be,\" said Sanct-Franciscus as the musicians brought out two branches of brass tintinabula and four small mallets with which to strike them; the melody they played was Greek, and soon their singer joined in, spinning out the bittersweet lyrics with little attention to their meaning. \"Not that \u0027Young Wife\u0027s Lament\u0027 again,\" said Cecania. \"Everyone\u0027s heard it.\" \"Still, it is engaging,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. Cecania gave a moue of disgust. \"If such sentiments please you.\" \"They would,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, \"if they were presented more appropriately. The singer does not understand the meaning of the syllables she is singing.\" He resisted the urge to join the musicians: perhaps later, he thought. \"So you have taste in music, do you?\" Cecania inquired, making a world of possibilities fill the simple question. \"I have found it to my liking,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, thinking that for the first five hundred years after his death, he had no interest in the art; only after he had arrived in Egypt had he developed a fondness for songs and the sound of instruments. \"Over time.\" \"Over time,\" Cecania repeated. \"Then music is part of the story of your life. That must be a fascinating tale.\" Again she licked her lips slowly with the tip of her tongue. \"Hardly that,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, and watched Cecania mull over his response. It was all so predictable, he thought, their appetites and the satiation without fulfillment. How they devoured everything, and how little nourishment they gained! She lolled back against the cushions on the rise of her couch, one arm extended as if in negligent summons. \"I told Vulpius that I want a young man who might be mistaken for a gladiator-without the scars, of course, and not too brutal. What did you ask for?\" Before Sanct-Franciscus could frame his answer, Fabricius stood up and held up his goblet. \"This is to wash away the old year, and to welcome the new,\" he announced, and drank deeply, two little rivulets of wine brimming down his chin and onto his clothing. Vulpius signaled to Leontius. \"The second course,\" he commanded. \"See to it.\" The steward nodded, ducked his head, and stepped back from the door in order to pass on the orders to the waiting slaves. \"Do not intrude; do your work invisibly. Step lively, remove what is left, then serve what you have brought. Do not spill anything,\" he warned the six. \"Bring what is uneaten out and take it with you to the kitchen.\" Each tray being carried held a wide, shallow crockery bowl containing fresh mussels and seafood forcemeat in a thick, gingered sauce; this delicious offering was accompanied by stacks of buttered griddle-bread. The slaves set these down on the tables, saluted Vulpius and his wife, picked up the platters from the first course, then left the dining room promptly and in good order. \"Well done,\" Leontius approved once the slaves were in the corridor again. \"Next, fingerbowls and napkins, then comes the squab in apricots and spiced broccoli with leeks in pepper-oil.\" \"After that, the shoats stuffed with chopped figs, apples, and onions,\" said the senior slave, a Gaul called Cepin. \"You\u0027ll need help serving them. Alert three kitchen slaves to be ready to assist you.\" Leontius clapped his hands to send them on their way, but called after them, \"You will have your convivium when this is finished.\" \"Oh yes,\" said Cepin in happy anticipation. \"Cook is making the chickens ready for spitting once the stuffed yearling calves are served, so we will not have to wait long after the masters have finished to begin our meal. We\u0027ll have the chickens and fish-and-celery stew and rabbits in gravy and anything the masters haven\u0027t eaten, as well as many breads for us, as is the custom. And we\u0027ll have the entertainers and musicians to dine with us at the end of the night-those not busy elsewhere.\" He grinned, showing uneven teeth, three of which were missing. \"And griddle-breads,\" added another slave. \"Cook has a tub of batter.\" \"Then to your work,\" Leontius said, and went back into the dining room, ducking his head again to his master. Vulpius had risen from his couch and was approaching the musicians in the reception room. \"Come in with us; bring your instruments. You may play while we dine; the others may rest in anticipation of a busy time ahead.\" The musicians hastened to obey; they held their instruments carefully, and stayed near Vulpius as they moved through the couches. \"I like the look of that flute-player,\" Lucillius said to Sanct-Franciscus, smiling expectantly. \"Flute-players have agile lips and fingers.\" \"I suppose they must,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, who played the flute tolerably well himself and knew its demands. \"Light, quick fingers are often needed.\" \"Rather like that thief you spared,\" Lucillius said, and laughed. \"Vulpius told me you tended to his injuries at the prison.\" \"I did.\" Sanct-Franciscus waited while Lucillius had his goblet refilled. \"Why did you bother?\" Lucillius asked. \"No one else was likely to do it,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"I don\u0027t imagine he thanked you,\" Lucillius said as one of the serving slaves came to remove the platter from the first course, and his body-slave refilled his goblet. \"Actually, he did,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, not adding that he had offered Natalis a position in his household upon his release from prison; he nodded toward Lucillius\u0027 wife. \"This may not interest you, Domina.\" \"It doesn\u0027t,\" she said, sounding both half-drunk and bored; Docilla Adonica Tiberius, Domina Lucillius, scowled at her husband, then smiled at Sanct-Franciscus. \"You could be interesting, however.\" Sanet-Franciscus gestured an apology. \"I ask your pardon, Domina, but it is not the custom of my people to-\" \"Not another man of restraint!\" she exclaimed, pursing her lips in disgust. \"Are you one of those strict Christians? Not the ones who share everything, but the others, who are forever pestering decent Romans and making a display of their religion to the denigration of all the rest? They have been beating up patrons of the lupanar and the Guard there hasn\u0027t been able to stop them. I didn\u0027t think Vulpius would be so foolish as to invite anyone of that stripe to Saturnalia.\" \"No, I am not a Christian,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"I am an exile.\" Adonica considered this, sighed, and signaled the slave for more wine. \"I\u0027ll have to wait for a bit, then.\" \"Never mind my wife-she\u0027s becoming fatigued,\" said Lucillius. \"After such a Saturnalia as this has been, I am surprised you are all still awake,\" said Sanct-Franciscus with a slight smile. Lucillius chose to laugh at this observation. \"Truly. We Romans are a hearty breed, and it takes more than a few nights of feasting and drinking to flatten us. Not even war has exhausted us.\" He accepted a linen square from the slave carrying the basin of lemon-water before dunking his hands into the warm liquid. While he dried his fingers, he added, \"Foreigners often see our enjoyments as weakness, not what they are: the strength of the people; we have fortitude, and that requires great jollity. For as we must be powerful and resolute in purpose, so we must be able to make the most of our entertainments, in all forms, so that we do not become despotic. Just as we fight with a will, so we feast and drink with a will.\" Overhearing this, Caio yelled out, \"True! True!\" \"Even our women are mighty,\" said Lucillius, glancing at his wife, who glowered at him in return. \"That they may be,\" said Fabricius, joining in. \"But they are also the true flowers of Roma. Nothing so fair as they can be found outside our walls.\" Although the praise was genuine, his expression was salacious and earned him a sharp stare from his wife, which he pointedly ignored. The slaves carried in the third course and set the broad platters down, then the plates of griddle-bread. With the musicians striking up a little march, they left the diners alone once more. \"Mussels,\" said Peregrinus eagerly, using a griddle-bread to scoop up the food. \"You had them from-?\" \"From Neapolis, preserved in brine, of course,\" said Vulpius. \"Ah, Neapolis,\" said Peregrinus, and took a large bite before calling out, \"Bring me my evening\u0027s slave!\" \"My guest commands,\" said Vulpius, and called out to Leontius, \"Bring the pleasure-slaves. All of them.\" \"At once,\" said Leontius, and left his place at the door to go around the atrium, where rain was falling, to the waiting room. \"You,\" he said to the twenty slaves waiting there; all were dressed well and had been carefully groomed and anointed with fragrant oils for the evening. \"Come with me. They are asking for you.\" The arrival of the pleasure-slaves was greeted with cries of delight; Leontius had already told the slaves to which couches they should go, and they passed among the guests without confusion. Only Sanct-Franciscus remained without companionship; he watched the guests seize upon their pleasure-slaves much the same way they were guttling their food, thinking they were hungry as wolves, preferring excess to appreciation; the very touching he sought most was valued least here. He rose, so as not to be conspicuous, and went to the musicians. \"Would you mind if I borrowed your lyre?\" The musician looked up, mildly startled. \"It ... it is valuable, honestiorus.\" \"No doubt,\" said Sanct-Franciscus reasonably. \"I will not harm it; if it should be damaged tonight, I give you my Word I will replace it.\" After a brief inner struggle, the musician surrendered his instrument. \"Do you know how to play?\" \"Tolerably well,\" Sanct-Franciscus answered as he tried the strings, and adjusted one of them to a truer pitch. \"Well, you have an ear,\" the musician conceded. Sanct-Franciscus ducked his head and began to play a lively paean to the sun that he had learned from the god who changed him, more than twenty-three hundred years ago. It was fairly unsophisticated, but the tempo was quick and the tune rapturous, just the accompaniment this occasion called for. Cecania studied Sanct-Franciscus from her couch as if trying to decide if she should make another attempt at captivating him; then, with the most minimal of shrugs, she extended her arm to the pleasure-slave who waited at her side; around her most of the other guests were beginning to engage their pleasure-slaves in titillation, except for Caio, who had a young man and a young woman already bent over him, making him ready for his gratification while he continued to dine. Vulpius and his wife had three pleasure-slaves between them-two men and a woman-trading them back and forth as they made the most of their own celebration. The household slaves continued to serve food and drink. The night wore on, the seven courses of the banquet were served with increasing display; the guests ate to repletion, visited the vomitorium, and ate more, all the while engaging their pleasure-slaves in an increasingly wild exhibition of desire and lubricity, concupiscence mixing with gormandizing. Through it all, Sanct-Franciscus played songs from every part of the earth he had visited. When exhaustion overtook the guests, and Vulpius ordered the entertainers to perform, the musician remarked to him, \"You are among the best I have heard. My lyre is privileged to have you touch it.\" \"How gracious of you,\" said Sanct-Franciscus before making his way through the tangle of guests and slaves, trays and platters and discarded garments, in order to return to his couch, the only one among the guests who was not luxuriating in the bounty of the last night of Saturnalia. Text of a letter as written by Rugeri in Alexandria to Sanct-Franciscus in Roma. My master, I have been told by Domina Clemens in a letter sent three months ago that you have not been receiving the letters I have been sending you, one every other month, for all of last year. This troubled me, for it seemed more than mishap or coincidence that so many letters should fail to reach you, and I determined to discover the reasons for these failures. I began by discussing the matter with your shipping-agent, and, having seen to my satisfaction that he was not to blame, I looked closer to this household. To my chagrin, I discovered that the letters had been taken by Perseus, the clerk I bought from the Byzantine merchant, and he was selling the information in the letters to various merchants and suppliers. I apologize most earnestly for my lapse in judgment, and I ask you to pardon my inability to protect our communications as I should have. Beyond this admission, I must also tell you that Perseus has not disclosed how many of my letters-or yours-he has taken, and so I am at a loss to know what you know of my present circumstances. Are you aware that I made a gift to Hebseret and the Priests of Imhotep in your name? Do you know that I have ransomed nine of your crew from the Aeolus, and that all but one of them have returned to your service? Have you received a copy of the agreement I have made with the weavers of the upper Nile for linen and cotton? I ask that you send me word of what you last heard from me, and I will see you have copies of all I have sent to you since. I will also pledge to put all the letters into the hands of your captains myself, entrusting them to no one but the captains. This one will go to Epimetheus Bion, of the Pleiades, who is set to depart as soon as the present weather clears. I will also send a copy to Domina Clemens, by the Zephyrus, which sails for Ravenna in three weeks, weather permitting. Perseus has been turned over to the Prefecture of Trade here, his case assigned to the chief decuria for assessment. I will inform you of any decision made in regard to his actions, and the punishment that is meted out to him. I believe it must be strict, if not severe, but I will not ask for him to be condemned to the arena unless you tell me that is your wish. Given your past treatment of slaves, I believe you would not want him to suffer anything so grievous as that. I have a few pieces of good news to pass on to you: I have secured four full barrels of pepper and will dispatch them with Captain Bion. No doubt you will be able to sell at a handsome profit. And I have met with a physician from the East, one who has come across the Arabian Sea, and who is eager to find a place to practice his art. I have introduced him to Hebseret, who has said that Chandolar\u0027s skills will be useful to the Priests of Imhotep, and so have provided him money to purchase the herbs and other substances of his medicaments. When more is known of his abilities, I will send on to you the proportions and methods of preparation this Chandolar employs. For now, I will say no more, in case this should fall into unfriendly hands in spite of all my precautions. I ask you to be circumspect in your reply, again as a precaution. Captain Bion is expecting to carry a message back to me from you, and has given his word to keep the letter in a locked box for the duration of his voyage; his reliability is known to us both, but it is as well to be discreet. In all devotion, and trusting in your resolution and fairness, I commend myself to you, Rogerian of Gades Rugeri of Alexandria in my own hand on the 10th day of January in the 972nd Year of the City The letter as received by Sanct-Franciscus. To my master, I am pleased to tell you that I have secured three fullbarrels of pepper and will dispatch them to you as soon as I may; the ship carrying this letter should bring the barrels as well. I have hope that we will have more such cargos to deliver in the coming months. You should be able to make a handsome profit in the fora with these barrels. I have also dealt with the priests you have expressed interest in, and they are now moving up the Nile to a more distant temple where they can practice their rites unimpeded by the Romans and others who disapprove of Egyptian sorcery. There have been many complaints about them, and this seems to me to be one way to dispel the ill-will they have gained over the last few years. You, being in Roma, will not have seen the rising hostility the people have of these priests, who may not be worthy of your loyal support. I urge you to consider ending your association with them, so that your dealings are not tainted with their magic and malice-for whatever they may seem to be to you, others find them malefic, which cannot accrue to your benefit. I ask you to give this matter your full and immediate attention. I was told by the local prosecutor that your taxes here are likely to be higher in the near future, due to the debasement of the denarius, the burden of which has reached all the Empire. The merchants from across the Arabian Sea have asked for gold coins only, or if they are silver, they must come from Fars, or be from the reigns no later than Marcus Aurelius. I have assured those merchants that we will deal in gold, and so I ask you to dispatch as much as you can spare so that my pledge may not be construed as false. I will have to replace a few of the slaves in my household and those who labor for this business. Some have proven to be disloyal, and those I have given-in your name, of course-to the Legions to serve the men in any capacity they should choose. I will inform you of the new slaves when I have purchased them. One will be for my own use, as a body-servant and to fulfill my desires, something you will not deny me I am sure. I have bought copper and tin in abundance, and struck a good bargain for the metals. I know if they are carried to you on different ships, you will not be accused of bringing materials for weapons into Roma, and you should be able to turn a handsome profit on the sale of the metals to the Praetorians, who always want new swords and shields and spears and daggers and cudgels. I will put guards on the ships carrying the metals, and I advise you to meet the ships at Ostia yourself, to make sure they are not set upon by thieves and robbers. Your loyal factor, Rugeri of Iberia at Alexandria in Aegytpus on the 11th day of January in Roma\u0027s 972nd Year","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19/page-10.html","bookId":2502,"book":{"id":2502,"title":"Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19)","description":"Storyline: Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19) Rome is crumbling. The child-emperor, Heliogabalus, diverts the Roman populace with parties, circuses, and celebrations, while his mother and grandmother jockey for power behind the scenes. The government is riddled with scandal and no business is conducted without bribes which grow ever larger. Religions joust for prominence, with factions of Christians seeking to overthrow the ancient Roman pantheon. Courtesans, once honored for their skills and protected by special guards, have become targets of opprobrium. The vampire Ragoczy Germanius Sanct\u0027 Franciscus, already subject to extra taxes and regulations because he is a foreigner, falls under the maleficent eye of Telemachus Batsho, a minor functionary who dreams of power and wealth. When Franciscus thwarts his attempts to extort ever-increasing sums from a young Roman of good birth, Batsho swears revenge. Franciscus finds his activities closely monitored and is accused of treason and conspiracy. His friends, threatened with similar scrutiny, abandon him to Batsho\u0027s mercies or urge him to leave the Eternal City. But Franciscus has many ties to Rome. He has taken under his protection a beautiful courtesan who was brutally beaten by the very men who should have been protecting her. She has been the vampire\u0027s sustenance for many months. Franciscus is also held in the city by the plight of the family Laelius. The Domina\u0027s health is failing despite the vampire\u0027s great medical skills; her son has converted to Christianity and rails against his mother\u0027s beliefs; her daughter Ignatia, who has sacrified her own life to care for her mother, realizes that when her mother dies, her fate will rest in the hands of her increasingly fanatical brother. Determined to claim pleasure for herself, Ignatia invites Franciscus\u0027s attentions, inflaming him with the power of her untapped sexuality. Unfortunately, they are not unobserved, and their simple yet powerful act of love sparks a conflagration that destroys Ignatia\u0027s family and nearly brings about the vampire\u0027s True Death.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:00:28 PM"}}
