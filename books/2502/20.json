{"id":106685,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Bonar Datus Fabricius stood in the doorway of Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 study, Aedius immediately behind him. He cleared his throat and tugged on the sleeve of his forest-green pallium of Armenian wool, his manner suggesting he had no liking for his errand here. \"I thank you for permitting me to visit you this way, honestiorus. I am sorry, but I am going to intrude on your hospitality still further: Verus Lucillius will join us shortly.\" He glanced over his shoulder as if to find Lucillius blowing into the house on the gusty September wind.\\n\\n \"Dear me,\" Sanct-Franciscus said serenely; he was seated at his writing table, a sheet of vellum lying before him, a stylus and ink-cake to his right; he presented a fine appearance: his black dalmatica was embroidered in silver and dark red down the center of the garment in an array of interlocking winged disks, and he wore but a single piece of jewelry-a silver ring of the same eclipse design as distinguished his garment, with a black sapphire at its center. He smiled as he rose. \"I am honored by your presence, as I will be by Lucillius\u0027,\" he said as good manners required. \"But-you will pardon me-I am also somewhat nonplussed.\"\\n\\n \"I understand why you might wonder at my coming, seeing that we have only met once, and that was at Saturnalia. I know this makes my presence now seem importunate.\" He took a step into the room, his face somber. \"I would have sent a messenger, but I feared he might take too long to reach you.\"\\n\\n \"Therefore I must suppose your errand has some urgency to it?\"\\n\\n \"Alas,\" Fabricius confirmed.\\n\\n \"Then tell me what has brought you here, if you can do so without Lucillius. I have an engagement to visit Desiderius Vulpius in an hour, and cannot spare too much time just at present.\" Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 manner was genial but not apologetic. \"I trust this will not inconvenience you or Lucillius?\"\\n\\n \"That is one of the matters that concerns us-your appointment with our friend.\" He ducked his head and tried not to appear as awkward as he felt. \"It would be better for him and for you if you didn\u0027t keep it.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, the first awareness of Fabricius\u0027 intention making him more attentive. \"Perhaps you had best choose a seat, illustriatus, and I will send my steward to get refreshments for you, while you explain as much of this as you are able,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, then, without waiting for a response from Fabricius, turned to Aedius. \"Bring breads and wine, and with them whatever savory is proper for the hour. Another guest will arrive shortly, and sustenance should be provided for him as well as for this illustriatus.\"\\n\\n Fabricius hesitated, waiting until Aedius was gone. \"I cannot promise that you will wish me to remain once I tell you the reason for my visit. I know that what I must impart will not be greeted with delight.\"\\n\\n There was a slight, enigmatic smile in Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 eyes, and his tone had an ironic edge. \"You fear I would kill the messenger?\"\\n\\n \"Something of the sort, yes,\" said Fabricius, edging toward an elegant couch. \"But if you would not mind?\"\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus made a gesture between a salute and an invitation. \"When you are comfortable, tell me what is your purpose in coming here, if you would.\"\\n\\n \"It concerns Desiderius Vulpius,\" said Fabricius.\\n\\n \"So I surmised,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, his affability unruffled.\\n\\n \"There are events taking place that may prove difficult for you, and for your friends,\" said Fabricius, and stopped as if afraid to go on.\\n\\n \"How do you mean? What is the difficulty these events pose?\" Sanct-Franciscus shifted in his chair so that he almost faced Fabricius directly.\\n\\n \"There are questions being asked about you, at a very high level,\" said Fabricius. \"A very high level,\" he repeated for emphasis.\\n\\n \"Why should I not be flattered by such attention,\" he asked as if he had no sense of the possibilities this notoriety could mean.\\n\\n \"Questions of this sort don\u0027t praise or benefit you,\" said Fabricius testily.\\n\\n \"What are they?\" Sanct-Franciscus kept his voice level and his gaze trained on Fabricius.\\n\\n \"I am not truly at liberty to tell you, not as you should be told, and must wait a bit longer to discuss all that-When Lucillius arrives, we will be able to present you with our observations,\" Fabricius acknowledged; his expression was changing from stern to regretful.\\n\\n \"If you can say nothing to the point, how am I to learn what is suspected?\"\\n\\n \"The decuriae will handle the matter once your role in the matter in question is established,\" said Fabricius. \"In the meantime, your friends will be under the same cloud that hangs over you.\"\\n\\n \"About which you cannot tell me,\" Sanct-Franciscus said.\\n\\n \"No; none of us are permitted to tell you what the nature of the investigation is. We must report only what we know. If we speculate, we can be cited for it.\"\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus was silent while he considered his predicament, then asked, \"How am I to diminish the danger to my friends if I am uninformed of the government\u0027s suspicions? I could easily, and inadvertently, implicate my Roman friends and associates in my danger if I have-\"\\n\\n \"Three of your friends have been admonished to have no contact with you, which is why I am here, and Lucillius is coming.\" A spot of color appeared in his face, as if his admission were embarrassing.\\n\\n \"You are deputies, in effect,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"You make it possible for Vulpius not to expose himself by visiting me. By coming in his stead, you are sparing him any greater trouble.\"\\n\\n \"That is what we hope to achieve,\" Fabricius admitted. \"This is not how I would deal with such matters, but it is what Vulpius has asked, and I have many ties to him, as well as the tie of friendship. I could not refuse him this favor.\" He coughed once, as if to show his disapproval.\\n\\n \"Then you are a worthy friend, to do such kindness for Desiderius Vulpius,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, only a suggestion of wry amusement in his compliment. \"I am grateful to you for your undertaking.\"\\n\\n Fabricius blinked in surprise at this remark. \"You are most gracious; this news must be unpleasant for you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it is, but I am not astonished by it,\" Sanct-Franciscus said, recollecting the many times in the past that his presence had become suddenly unwelcome, and the quick shift in loyalties that had accompanied his falls from positions of influence. \"Exiles all know what it is to be at peril.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Yes. I suppose you would,\" Fabricius said, and looked up as Aedius brought in a tray and the news that Pius Verus Lucillius had arrived.\\n\\n \"Bring him here,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, taking note of all that was on the tray. \"A fine selection: the chopped apples in honey are a good touch.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell the kitchen staff,\" said Aedius as he left the two men alone again.\\n\\n \"Would you like to pour the wine? There is red and white: you may choose whichever you prefer,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Fabricius, his voice dropping and his demeanor becoming more relaxed; he reached for the white wine and poured a generous amount into his cup. \"What will you have?\"\\n\\n \"Alas, I do not drink wine,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"It is a condition of my blood.\"\\n\\n \"How unfortunate,\" said Fabricius, more from good form than actual concern; all foreigners had idiosyncrasies, and Sanct-Franciscus, cultured though he was, was no exception to that rule. \"I trust you have other means to satisfy your thirst?\" Fabricius did not wait for an answer, and expected none; he put two rolled-and skewered strips of lamb stuffed with herbs and garlic on the small plate provided for such use, and then took a pillow-bread from the basket, licking his fingers before he reached for the tub of mixed butter and olive oil. \"This is a most satisfactory repast. You observe our ways better than most Romans.\"\\n\\n \"You are good to say so,\" Sanct-Franciscus told him as he rose to greet Lucillius.\\n\\n \"I see you have that thief working for you,\" Lucillius remarked as he entered the study; he was a bit windblown, the deep, shoulder-pleats of his calf-length, rust-colored pallium hanging in disarray. Tugging at his belt, he attempted to restore order to his appearance.\\n\\n \"Yes; he is a very useful messenger,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, his calm unchanged. \"You are welcome to this house.\"\\n\\n \"A bad business, this,\" said Lucillius, his demeanor serious, his voice roughened by worry. \"Enough to want me to return to the provinces again, away from the schemes and workings of Roma.\"\\n\\n \"I would be pleased to send for a mirror, if you like,\" Sanct-Franciscus offered as Lucillius continued to wrestle with his pallium.\\n\\n \"I think this will do for now,\" said Lucillius, glancing at the tray. \"Lamb and crab. Very nice.\" He sat down on the Phoenician chair next to the table and poured himself a cup of red wine. \"Excellent color. Where do you get it?\"\\n\\n \"From the north; from a vineyard southwest of Florentia.\" Sanct-Franciscus knew that Lucillius was not being rude, but was trying to avoid the moment when he would have to address the reason for his visit. \"The Widow Clemens owns that vineyard, as she owns this house.\"\\n\\n \"One of the provident women,\" Lucillius approved, picking up three morsels of crab and then taking some of the butter-and-oil with the small scoop provided. \"And pillow-bread.\" With this to sustain him, he finally looked directly at Sanct-Franciscus. \"I suppose Fabricius has told you the reason for our calling?\"\\n\\n \"He said that there are inquiries being made into my affairs that may reflect badly on my friends and associates here in Roma,\" Sanct-Franciscus said, adding to Fabricius, \"That about sums it up, or have I missed some item of importance?\" He saw Fabricius nod while he ate.\\n\\n \"I think you have grasped the essence,\" said Fabricius through his chewing.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an astute fellow, Sanct-Franciscus,\" Lucillius approved. \"And it pains me to see you in such a predicament, but I fear that just at present, it can\u0027t be helped.\"\\n\\n \"Because I am a foreigner and cannot challenge the Senate\u0027s authority,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\\n\\n \"Such is the state of affairs,\" said Lucillius. \"And I can only hope that there will be a speedy resolution to this situation, for all our sakes, but I am afraid your contract with Propinus and Gratians has been declared void. With the decuriae investigating, it could be weeks, or months, until the matter is wholly put to rest.\" He took a generous sip of wine. \"I think it is all overblown fussiness, but in these times, we cannot afford to have enemies in our midst.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly not,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\\n\\n \"And while this may appear unfair to you, as a foreigner, you must understand that we Romans are in the toils of intrigue on many fronts.\" He drank again. \"There are barbarians beyond our borders who are jealous of our Empire, and would seek to destroy it. So the decuriae have been charged with the task of revealing those working against us while living among us.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that Sanct-Franciscus should file a petition to have the inquiry quashed?\" Fabricius asked as he reached for more lamb.\\n\\n \"No. I fear that would only compromise him further.\" said Lucillius, his attention on their host. \"You have done business with many Romans, haven\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I have, but most of them are associates only, hardly companions,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\\n\\n \"But a petition would force an answer from the Curia,\" said Fabricius.\\n\\n Lucillius glowered. \"If anything, attempting to press the Curia would make the problems worse, for it could be assumed that he was seeking to conceal his dealings, which would put everyone at a disadvantage, including his most distant affiliates. The Curia will not be adjured in that manner. Now is the time when, as a foreigner, he must be forthcoming and candid, making no effort to engage others in his predicament, for honestiorus or not, he is a foreigner, and that will count against him.\" He cleared his throat. \"So far, none of Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 business records have been confiscated, but they could be, and then everyone would have more trouble to deal with.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, there would be further inquiries among those who share in his business?\" Fabricius was so transparent in the rehearsed nature of his questions that Sanct-Franciscus almost laughed aloud.\\n\\n \"That would be the least of it,\" said Lucillius, still watching Sanct-Franciscus. \"If any part of his business practices are questionable, the impact on his associates could be devastating.\"\\n\\n \"So I understand,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, stopping Lucillius before he could launch into more of his disguised exhortations. \"And I may reassure you that there is no reason for anyone with whom I have business dealings to fear that I have not observed the proprieties and the law in all I have done.\"\\n\\n Lucillius shook his head. \"There was the matter of a slave in Alexandria-\"\\n\\n \"If you mean Perseus, you know he was stealing from me, and from those in business with me. It is all in the records of the Prosecutor of Customs.\" He regarded Lucillius for a moment, then went on, \"If someone is hoping to hold me to blame for my own losses, I will own myself astonished.\"\\n\\n Fabricius refilled his cup and said before taking refuge in drinking, \"It is being said that the thefts were a clever ruse, to make it appear that you had been put at a disadvantage when you had not.\"\\n\\n Stung by these implications, Sanct-Franciscus responded sharply. \"But I cannot ascertain who claims this, or why, can I?\"\\n\\n \"No; since you are not a Roman,\" said Lucillius.\\n\\n \"But it is known that you didn\u0027t pursue the slave in the courts. You allowed him to live, when you might have demanded his life.\" Fabricius raised his eyes again, his expression hardening.\\n\\n \"Is that the extent of my perfidy?\" Sanct-Franciscus said, once again lightening his tone. \"That I did not try to have the slave killed?\"\\n\\n \"That is a portion of the reason,\" said Lucillius, suddenly cautious.\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus allowed himself a short chuckle. \"And how could I-an exile in Roma-demand that the Romans in Alexandria condemn a slave for theft? I would have no authority to require such a response-if I did, it might have been assumed I wanted to silence the slave, for I no longer owned him, and that would make for harsher accusations than the present inquiry implies.\" He went to the window and tapped on the translucent panes of thin, polished alabaster. \"I have done what would be least intrusive under Roman law, and now it seems that my very scrupulousness has brought me under suspicion.\"\\n\\n Lucillius gestured his helplessness. \"It is often so.\"\\n\\n \"At least you have been willing to abide by the laws of Roma, and respected our gods,\" said Fabricius, trying to put a good face on Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 predicament. \"That is to your credit.\"\\n\\n \"As we must hope,\" Lucillius amended. \"If it is determined that your compliance is actually an attempt to cover nefarious dealings, as you have proposed, well-\" He shrugged.\\n\\n \"In any case, I can see that I am at a disadvantage,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, unwelcome recollections of his last sojourn in Roma reminding him of how easily and how far a foreigner could fall. \"It appears that the only thing I can do for now is to wait-wait until the Curia decides.\"\\n\\n \"It will take time for all the reports on your trading enterprises to be prepared and presented to the Curia for their evaluation of your probity.\" Lucillius had more crab, then regarded Fabricius. \"How long do you think this should take?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps six months,\" said Fabricius, \"if there are no delays in securing the reports requested.\"\\n\\n \"Six months,\" Sanct-Franciscus repeated.\\n\\n \"If they get to it promptly, and all the reports provided are complete.\" Fabricius wiped his hands on the moist cloth provided for that purpose. \"It could be twice as long.\"\\n\\n \"That is not a very pleasant prospect,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"I wonder if I will be allowed to continue to trade while the Curia examines my accounts: do either of you know?\"\\n\\n \"It may come to that,\" said Lucillius. \"Or they may require a bond from you while their assessment is ongoing.\"\\n\\n \"In other words, the Curia and their decuriae will do their utmost to tie my hands and limit my access to them while they decide if I have been too honest or not honest enough,\" said Sanct-Franciscus sardonically.\\n\\n \"Something of the sort, I fear,\" said Lucillius, adding more wine to his partially empty cup; color was rising in his cheeks, and his face softened.\\n\\n \"And I am not to have direct contact with Desiderius Vulpius, or any of the others: Senator Italicus Romulus Primus Puero, or the illustriatus Cosimus Isidorus Crispus Horens, or Demetrius Numa Tarquinius Augustulus, or Ireaus Antonius Propinus, or Sovertius Gratians, or any other honoratus or illustriatus with whom I have had a business association, no matter how remote?\" He nodded, certain of the answer. \"If I am tainted, so they could be equally besmirched-is that the gist of it?\"\\n\\n \"I understand why you are dismayed,\" said Lucillius, wary of the sharpness of Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 tone.\\n\\n \"I should hope so,\" Sanct-Franciscus said. \"You would be outraged if the Curia should impose such restrictions upon you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Fabricius. \"But we are Romans, after all.\"\\n\\n \"And I am a foreigner in exile.\" Sanct-Franciscus paced the length of the study, then stopped still. \"Very well: so long as I am kept informed-regularly informed-of the progress of the investigation, I will abide by the restrictions placed upon me, at least for the period of a year. If the inquiry lasts longer, I will seek to find other avenues by which to resolve my predicament.\" He could see that his indignation was having the desired impact on his visitors, and he decided to use that response to his advantage. \"If you will swear to me that you will see to it that I am given accurate reports every month, you have my assurance that I will do my utmost to assist the Curia in its inquiries.\"\\n\\n Lucillius pressed his lips together, considering how to answer. \"So you will not seek to block or oppose them? You\u0027re willing to let the probe go forth?\"\\n\\n \"I am not in a position to stop it,\" Sanct-Franciscus admitted. \"If it is to be brought to a swift conclusion, I will have to aid the Curia, not try to hinder its tasks.\"\\n\\n \"A most ... reasonable position,\" said Fabricius, doing his best to conceal his surprise.\\n\\n \"Would a more belligerent one make this any easier?\" Sanct-Franciscus inquired with an air of worn geniality.\\n\\n \"Probably not,\" said Lucillius.\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus regarded his two visitors narrowly. \"Will you swear?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Lucillius. \"I have done enough business through you that I know you are forthright in your dealings. I will say as much to the Curia, and I will see that you are provided monthly reports from the decuriae assigned to your case.\"\\n\\n \"Among the decuriae, I don\u0027t suppose there is one called Telemachus Batsho, is there?\" Sanct-Franciscus asked, a slight, saturnine smile tweaking the corners of his mouth.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t recognize the name,\" said Fabricius, just a little too quickly.\\n\\n \"He may be one,\" said Lucillius, with feigned indifference. \"If you want to know, I will-\" He drank the last of his wine in a single, large gulp.\\n\\n \"No; I was only curious,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, convinced now that Batsho was the instigator of this punitive investigation. He indicated the tray of viands. \"Enjoy yourselves as long as you like, honestiora; my slaves will bring you more wine and food if you want them.\"\\n\\n \"But you ... you should be with us,\" said Fabricius, hastily drinking wine to help swallow his mouthful of pillow-bread. \"Your hospitality is exemplary, but we have no wish to impose upon you.\"\\n\\n \"You do not impose. I will return shortly; if I am not to call upon Vulpius, I must alert my stables and my staff.\" He nodded once and strode out of the study, making his way to his private apartments without unseemly haste. Here he found Rugeri setting out a dark-red laena in anticipation of his leaving. \"Do not bother,\" he said in Greek.\\n\\n Rugeri looked up, startled. \"My master?\" he said in the same tongue.\\n\\n \"I will not be calling upon Vulpius today.\" He quickly summed up what his two unexpected guests had told him, adding only, \"We must be very cautious now, my friend.\"\\n\\n \"Cautious? Perhaps it would be better to visit Alexandria, or Gallia,\" Rugeri suggested.\\n\\n \"That would only confirm the Curia\u0027s worst misgivings. No. This must be handled carefully, and in full view of Roma, or I will lose my businesses and jeopardize Olivia in the process.\" He paused. \"My various associates will have to be warned, inconspicuously, if possible.\"\\n\\n \"Then what do you propose to do?\" asked Rugeri.\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus put the tips of his fingers together, saying, \"I am going to write a note to my scribe at the villa; I will need Natalis to carry it for me.\"\\n\\n \"Natalis?\" Rugeri was somewhat alarmed. \"Do you want to trust him with such a delicate mission?\"\\n\\n \"He can leave the city-and return-without being seen, and just now, that will be important, I believe; I dare not carry it myself, or write the letters of warning, for my handwriting would reveal that the notification came from me, and that would mean trouble if the notes are revealed to the Curia, as I must assume will happen if the Curia is determined to do a thorough inquiry. So the warnings must be anonymous, and from outside the city. For the rest, I will have to rely on Natalis\u0027 discretion.\" Sanct-Franciscus went to the small writing table under the window. \"While I prepare the note, will you find Natalis and bring him here?\"\\n\\n \"Without the household being made aware of it?\" Rugeri ventured, and saw Sanct-Franciscus nod. \"I will.\"\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus took an ink-cake from the drawer in the desk, and a rolled sheet of vellum from the pigeon-holes above the desktop, then drew up a stool and prepared to write. By the time Rugeri returned with Natalis, the note was finished and sealed, and the seal impressed with Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 eclipse sigil.\\n\\n \"My master,\" the two men said almost in unison.\\n\\n \"Thank you for being so prompt,\" Sanct-Franciscus said, turning to them. \"I have something for you to do, Natalis.\" He indicated the folded note. \"It is essential that this reach Villa Ragoczy before sunset. Do you think you can do it?\"\\n\\n Natalis considered. \"If you mean delivered there without being seen, as your manservant has told me, then I hope I can. If I can get past the Praetorian Camp, then there should be no trouble.\"\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus considered this. \"You may remain there at the villa for the night, provided you can do so unseen. This is for my scribe, Deomadus-for him and no other. Make sure he reads it immediately. You may return before sunrise if it suits your purpose, so long as no one is aware of your coming and going.\" He offered the folded-and-sealed vellum to Natalis. \"There will be aurea waiting for you for your efforts upon your return.\"\\n\\n \"Most generous,\" mumbled Natalis as he took it.\\n\\n \"I shall expect you before the sun has been up for two hours.\"\\n\\n \"I will be here,\" said Natalis. \"Or I will be in prison.\"\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus gave a crack of laughter. \"Then I will send out slaves to pay your fines, if you are.\"\\n\\n Rugeri glanced around the room. \"Do you want him to leave from here; from this room?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, indicating a closet on the far side of the chamber. \"Use those stairs. They will bring you out behind the stable, away from the Temple of Hercules and facing the alley to the Via Castrum.\" He saw the surprise on Natalis\u0027 face. \"You did not know about this staircase?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Natalis seemed a bit ashamed of this lapse.\\n\\n Sanct-Franciscus used a key to open the closet door. \"Rugeri will be here to unlock the door if I am not,\" he said, stepping aside for Natalis. \"The lower door will be left open until the third hour after sunrise, and then I will lock it.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" said Natalis, slipping the vellum into his wallet. \"I will strive to do as you wish. The note is for your scribe, who is named Deomadus. I may remain at the villa so long as I am hidden, at least until the hour before dawn.\"\\n\\n \"Precisely,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"Now you must be about your errand, and I must return to my ... guests.\" As he closed the door behind Natalis, Rugeri folded his arms. \"What is it? You do not trust him?\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\" Rugeri countered.\\n\\n \"We shall see,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, making for the door and the gallery beyond.\\n\\n \"That we will,\" said Rugeri as he picked up the laena and returned it to its peg on the wall.\\n\\n Text of a letter from Melidulci at Misenum to Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus in Roma; carried by private courier.\\n\\n To my most worthy and esteemed Patron, the honestiorus Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus, the greetings of Melidulci from Misenum and the Villa Solea, on the north side of the town, a thousand paces from the Via Appia,\\n\\n This is to tell you that I have found my home, and I should be content to remain here for the rest of my days. This estate is small-five hundred paces on a side-and producing grapes, fruits, olives, and greens, as well as grazing cattle and goats. I have five horses, a pair of mules, and a donkey, fourteen slaves, and three freemen to handle market-days for me. The setting is private, but not so remote that I might as well be in Germania Inferior. My house has ten rooms, a large kitchen-and-bake-house, a bath and a building-shed. There are two springs on the property, so water is not a problem, and the fields are drained by ditches that carry the water and offal to the sea. All in all, it is everything I could wish for, and I thank you for the loan of the money to buy it. As my fields bear fruit I will repay you on the terms you agreed to, for I cannot accept such an extravagant gift from you, not and hold my head up.\\n\\n If ever you should want to visit me here, I would welcome you. I know you must have many invitations, and many must be more worthy than mine, but none, I assure you, is more sincere than this one, and for that reason alone, I hope you will one day permit me to offer you the same hospitality you extended to me in those hard days in Roma. We have had such pleasant moments together, we may still have one or two more, to enrich our memories.\\n\\n Fortunately, I have found a scribe-a freedman, and therefore a citizen-a sensible fellow from Brundisium, who is called Lars, for the Etruscan from whom he claims descent. He has been educated in Greek as well as Latin, in keeping accounts and making records, so I will have nothing to fear from the decuriae when it is time to pay my taxes, or to deal with the officials of the region. This Lars is clean-faced and steady of gaze, of modest demeanor without being subservient, but he is somewhat short-sighted, which, in spite of spectacles, has inclined him to scholarly pursuits rather than a more active life. You may write to me in confidence, knowing that Lars will reveal nothing of my business to anyone.\\n\\n I will never forget all you have done for me, and I will always think myself fortunate to have been afforded your good opinion when others were excoriating me for debauchery. You are most assuredly more entitled to the honor of Romans than most Romans are.\\n\\n On this, the 13th day of October in the 972nd Year of the City, and with my heart-felt gratitude,\\n\\n Melidulci\\n\\n by the hand of Lars, freedman and citizen of Roma \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19/page-20.html","bookId":2502,"book":{"id":2502,"title":"Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19)","description":"Storyline: Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19) \\n Rome is crumbling. The child-emperor, Heliogabalus, diverts the Roman populace with parties, circuses, and celebrations, while his mother and grandmother jockey for power behind the scenes. The government is riddled with scandal and no business is conducted without bribes which grow ever larger. Religions joust for prominence, with factions of Christians seeking to overthrow the ancient Roman pantheon. Courtesans, once honored for their skills and protected by special guards, have become targets of opprobrium. \\n The vampire Ragoczy Germanius Sanct\u0027 Franciscus, already subject to extra taxes and regulations because he is a foreigner, falls under the maleficent eye of Telemachus Batsho, a minor functionary who dreams of power and wealth. When Franciscus thwarts his attempts to extort ever-increasing sums from a young Roman of good birth, Batsho swears revenge. Franciscus finds his activities closely monitored and is accused of treason and conspiracy. His friends, threatened with similar scrutiny, abandon him to Batsho\u0027s mercies or urge him to leave the Eternal City. \\n But Franciscus has many ties to Rome. He has taken under his protection a beautiful courtesan who was brutally beaten by the very men who should have been protecting her. She has been the vampire\u0027s sustenance for many months. \\n Franciscus is also held in the city by the plight of the family Laelius. The Domina\u0027s health is failing despite the vampire\u0027s great medical skills; her son has converted to Christianity and rails against his mother\u0027s beliefs; her daughter Ignatia, who has sacrified her own life to care for her mother, realizes that when her mother dies, her fate will rest in the hands of her increasingly fanatical brother. \\n Determined to claim pleasure for herself, Ignatia invites Franciscus\u0027s attentions, inflaming him with the power of her untapped sexuality. Unfortunately, they are not unobserved, and their simple yet powerful act of love sparks a conflagration that destroys Ignatia\u0027s family and nearly brings about the vampire\u0027s True Death.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:00:28 PM"}}
