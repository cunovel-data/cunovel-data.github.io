{"id":106673,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Small flames danced on the peaks of a collection of beautiful budshaped alabaster oil-lamps, lending the room a soft glow that created a air of gauzy mystery, precisely as Melidulci intended they should. To further enhance her withdrawing room, she had set out three brass perfume pans over broad-based oil-lamps, to lend the air delectable sweetness, bestowing on her a touch of their delicate insouciance and providing a setting that would be sure to please her visitor. Most of her injuries had healed, but she was acutely aware of the scars remaining as unhappy reminders of her attack; she had no wish to reveal any more of them than absolutely necessary, and to that end she had donned her most elegant, gap-sleeved long tunica in peach-colored silk, the gaps fixed with brooches made of amber-and-gold, the clinging garment secured at the waist by a long ribbon of gold mesh. The night was cool, a bite of autumn in the air, but she had ordered the holocaust lit that afternoon, and the floor was warm from its heat, and would continue to keep them comfortable well into the night.\n \"So you have decided not to return to the lupanar,\" said Sanct-Franciscus from where he stood in the double-door facing the fountain in the center of the atrium; his black dalmatica, edged in silver eclipses, deepened the shadows in which he stood, as if he were a specter and not her honored guest.\n \"I believe it is best if I don\u0027t,\" she said, doing her best to smile at him without showing the red line running through her upper lip and toward her cheek, the most lingering reminder of the attack she had sustained; this was only the second time she had had a guest at her new house, and she felt strangely inept at performing her duties as hostess, for she had just a few slaves, chosen for their service not their appearance, to wait upon Sanct-Franciscus and her; no musicians strummed and plucked lyres and harps, no acrobats tumbled or contorted. Although she had chosen it, the simplicity of their evening unnerved her now that she was experiencing it.\n \"Because you do not trust the Guards of the Lupanar, and small wonder,\" he said, as if he had no doubt about it.\n \"I think it would be best if I don\u0027t return,\" she said more emphatically but without addressing his remark, then added, \"Or not for a while, in any case.\"\n \"Have you learned who they were who attacked you?\" He asked this as if he might be speaking of the turn of the seasons.\n \"No,\" she said tightly. \"I won\u0027t go back until I know their names. Perhaps not even then.\"\n \"If that is truly your wish, well and good; I hope you are not being frightened away,\" he said, moving toward her unhurriedly.\n \"Why should I not be frightened?\" she inquired, her question sharper than she had intended; she tried to lessen the stridency of her question. \"Had I been afraid before, I might have escaped harm.\"\n Sanct-Franciscus did not speak at once, and when he did, his voice was deep and gentle. \"You would do well to be rid of fear because fear infects everything it touches, leeching the joy from life. If you are staying away to try not to be frightened, you will not succeed: fear will shadow you.\" He studied her face with earnest concern.\n \"And you think that is the case?\" She attempted another smile, and managed somewhat better than before. \"Why?\"\n \"Because you have not received guests during the day, and you have offered no erotic entertainments in this new house-not as you have offered to your guests in the lupanar; you are very discreet, which is wise, but you are also striving to make yourself unnoticeable, except where you choose to be noticed,\" he said, coming to the end of her couch, ignoring the other couch on the far side of the low table where food would be placed.\n \"Do you have any objections to my methods?\" She was not angry, but she could not keep from fretting.\n \"No,\" Sanct-Franciscus said. \"It suits me well enough, visiting you after sundown for only the pleasure of your company, but it might not please many others, who may have different expectations of you, and who have long preferred you to all others.\"\n \"That is a matter of convenience for me, since I have no women sharing this house with me; I may have those I like call upon me, which permits me to keep to a schedule that I can accommodate. There are many who will find the evenings less ... hasty, and they are apt to do what they must to have more time and privacy ... .\" Hearing the note of defensiveness in her explanation, she made herself stop. \"I choose my company more carefully now.\"\n \"To your credit,\" he said, again coming a step nearer. \"You may keep a closer watch on your household as you live now.\"\n She took several heartbeats to gather her thoughts to answer. \"No, it\u0027s not that. Any woman knows that mystery adds to an encounter, and night is, by its nature, mysterious.\"\n \"And more exclusive,\" he suggested.\n She pressed her lips together, so she would not say anything too impulsive. \"I do not want to become one of those women who spend the entire day with eager men, and, by evening, has no inclination to amuse herself.\"\n \"Ah.\" He studied her for a long, silent moment, the kindness in his dark eyes unnerving her, so that she reached for a small handbell, and rang it, signaling her slaves to bring in the light repast she had ordered; three slaves appeared promptly, each carrying a tray that they set down on the table next to her couch.\n Melidulci had ordered scallops wrapped in bacon and broiled, boiled eggs peeled, halved, and stuffed with ground walnuts, vinegar, and olive oil mixed with the yolks, grilled eggplant, and toasted buns filled with chopped venison in a sauce of peppers, garlic, and onions; a basket of newly-baked olive-breads accompanied the meal. With this was a ewer filled with red wine from Florentia. \"I suppose it is useless to ask you if you want any of this excellent food?\"\n \"I fear I lack the stomach for it,\" he said in sardonic, honest dismay; he recognized all the dishes as having the reputation of increasing a man\u0027s ardor.\n She motioned to the food. \"It is a good convivium-not so heavy that you will be weary after eating, but not so light that you will be hungry.\"\n \"But Melidulci, you know I never dine,\" said Sanct-Franciscus; he had realized more than five hundred years ago that food could be as exciting to the senses of the living as embraces or compliments, and he had learned to encourage dining as part of physical pleasances.\n For a clumsy moment, she said nothing, then tried to smile. \"I know it isn\u0027t your habit to eat, but I thought ... given this occasion ...\"\n Sanct-Franciscus smiled. \"You are stimulant enough for me, Melidulci. Nothing you could offer could tempt me more than you do.\" His face softened. \"If you are hungry, eat. You will not offend me.\"\n To her astonishment, she felt herself blush. \"You\u0027re most ... gracious to say so,\"\n \"Melidulci.\" He spoke softly, but something in his tone compelled her attention. \"You have nothing to fear from me. I am not a monster, nor am I one who bargains in flesh. You need not placate me, or appease me-there is no cause: believe this.\"\n \"But surely ... It is fitting that I thank you ... After all you\u0027ve done?\" Her laughter was a bit too brittle to be genuine. \"I should think I owe you at least a gesture of gratitude.\"\n \"You have thanked me,\" he said. \"That is behind us.\"\n \"But I ... you are here for enjoyment, and I ... am no longer ... flawless.\"\n \"Your scars do not distress me: I have more and worse of my own.\" He sank down on the end of her dining couch and reached to touch her arm.\n \"You do not show them to me,\" she said reproachfully. \"Are you afraid they will disgust me?\"\n \"No; they are very severe.\" He put his spread hand to his waist, extending his fingers. \"From my thumb to my little finger.\"\n She stared. \"Scars of that sort could be deadly,\" she said somberly.\n \"So they could,\" he responded, adding and so they were to himself.\n \"Yet you say that flaws do not repel you?\" she challenged, angling her head upward.\n \"No, they do not,\" he said tranquilly. \"Flaws are often at the heart of beauty. Think of Mirabella, with her mole at the corner of her eye, or Eusacia, whose birthmark lends her face a catlike appearance. Neither of them are hampered by their flaws. Why should you be?\"\n \"Those are gifts of birth. I have scars from a beating.\" She made a determined effort not to cry.\n \"That could make a difference to some squeamish men,\" he allowed. \"But not to me.\"\n She stared at him. \"How can you look at me and not see me with my face swollen and broken? You must be repulsed.\"\n \"Not repulsed: saddened,\" he corrected her gently. \"I am sorry that you have had to bear the burdens imposed upon you.\"\n \"Imposed.\" She looked away, trying to stop a sudden rush of tears; she very nearly succeeded, and that gave her a brief satisfaction. She used her thumb and finger to pinch the bridge of her nose and wipe away the shine of moisture on her eyelids.\n \"What else would you call it?\" he asked, kindness suffusing his dark, compelling eyes.\n \"They would have been worse if not for you,\" said Melidulci; to distract herself she picked up a bacon-wrapped scallop and bit into it, chewed for a short while, then went on in a different tone, taking refuge in what she said. \"Before my Aunt Bonascientia-she was originally named Liatris-adopted me and brought me to the lupanar, I lived with my mother and father and two surviving brothers-another brother and a sister died young-to the north of Roma, near Pisae. I was called Emera then. My father and his brother had a good-sized holding beyond the town where they bred mules for the Legions and donkeys for farmers, and we did fairly well; they were respected in the region, and their mules were always wellconformed. I\u0027d had a marriage arranged with the son of a horse-breeder, and everything seemed set. I would probably have done well by Aquila; he was a sensible youth, and we\u0027d grown up together. But then Swine Fever came when I was twelve, and my brothers died, and then my uncle, and a year later, my father was kicked in the head by an injured mule, which left his wits addled.\" She sighed and finished her scallop. \"Why should I tell you this?\"\n \"Because you will feel less alone if you do,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, who welcomed this effort at closeness. \"Your aunt brought you here to Roma after so much loss.\" It was not quite a question. \"To the lupanar, where she lived.\"\n \"She did. She had been very successful in her work, and she had amassed a considerable amount of money-more than I have, and I have done quite well for myself.\"\n \"Yes, you have,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, encouraging her to go on.\n Melidulci banished the frown forming between her brows and ordered her memories. \"When she was informed about her brother\u0027s condition, she came to see for herself, and at once set about to provide for my father and mother. She took care of everything; arranged for the mules and donkeys to be sold and the land put under stewardship of Aquila\u0027s brother-the marriage had been forsworn by both families-and my mother provided for with rents from the land, so that she would not be without means in the world. When the land was dealt with, Aunt Bonascientia found slaves to take care of my father, and she paid for a Greek physician to treat him; my mother couldn\u0027t bear to do it, nor could I. Had my aunt not taken me in, my life would have been far less pleasant, and far less profitable than it has been.\" Wiping her hands on a square of linen set out next to a bowl of water for the purpose of cleaning greasy fingers, she continued, \"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m telling you this ... I don\u0027t ... I never talk about my life before the lupanar. And when I\u0027ve been asked, I haven\u0027t told the truth.\" She admitted this without embarrassment, but with a hint of regret. \"Most men prefer a fable to the actuality.\"\n \"But I do not want a fable, I want the whole of you. I thank you for revealing so much.\"\n \"Thank me, for lamenting my misfortunes?\" she asked, sounding chagrined. \"What man wants to-\"\n \"Misfortune came upon you when you were young, unaccountably, and has done so again,\" said Sanct-Franciscus.\n She stared at him, considering what he had said. \"Yes,\" she agreed slowly. \"Yes. I suppose I hope that I will be as lucky this time as I was then, although Aunt Bonascientia has been dead more than a decade. The gods are not always kind, even to those who honor them.\"\n \"It is hard when all your family has died,\" he said, a haunted look in his eyes.\n \"It is,\" she said, with the uncanny certainty that he had endured more devastating losses than she. \"I understand I have two cousins somewhere, and three other relatives, but-\"\n \"You must not despair, Melidulci. You have prevailed,\" he said, lifting her hand and kissing the palm.\n \"I hope I have,\" she said, a bit unsteadily as she selected a stuffed egg-half and began to eat.\n He released her hand and poured wine into one of two beautiful, costly glass goblets. \"Here. You will feel better if you have wine with your food.\"\n She took the goblet from him, holding it up to the display of oil-lamps so that she could see the brilliant red heart of the wine. \"You are so kind to me.\"\n He said nothing, reflecting that if this little courtesy was kindness, she must have been ill-used many times in the past, or she had become inured to lack of consideration, which lent even the most minor service a significance beyond its deserving. He realized it also meant that the high regard for the women of the lupanar, once unquestioned and upheld throughout the Empire, was now corroding, along with the other traditional attitudes of Romans. This unrelenting sensuality and excitation had blunted the Romans\u0027 perceptions to the point that only greater voluptuary indulgence could rouse them, and the lack of respect for the women of the lupanar was only one result of this dulled state. He sat, gazing at her, taking in every nuance of her demeanor, her manner, her expression. When she had drunk half the contents of the goblet, he took it from her and set it down on its tray, then leaned forward to gently, gently kiss her mouth. \"You are all the savor I require.\"\n This time she made no effort to hide the color that rose in her cheeks. \"Wine; it heats me,\" she said by way of explanation, although both of them knew it was not the cause.\n \"Perhaps,\" he allowed, and kissed her again, a longer and more arousing kiss, one that seemed to touch every bit of her flesh, quickening passion and speeding her pulse. As his lips touched hers once more, he enveloped her in his arms.\n \"Oh, I ... ,\" Melidulci exclaimed as they broke apart. Inwardly she chided herself for behaving like a green girl: she was an experienced, successful prostitute, one of the most celebrated in Roma, honored and praised from Egypt to Gaul, yet here she was, her senses tingling, breathless, almost vertiginous with desire, as if she were new to the ways of men, and learning the power of Amor for the first time. What was it about Sanct-Franciscus that awakened so much of her amorousness? She found it strange that this foreigner, who used her so unlike other men, should have the power to stir her to the depths of her desires.\n \"You are as beautiful as the evening star in a violet sky, Melidulci, and nothing can change that,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, his fingers trailing up her arm. At each brooch, he stopped and carefully unfastened it, exposing more of her skin. By the time he reached the largest, at her shoulder, he could feel the frisson his touch evoked.\n She was breathing more quickly, and her eyes were lustrous as the lamplight. As he pulled the tibia from the brooch at her shoulder, the silk slithered luxuriously down her body, exposing her breast and pulling the material more provocatively against her. \"I ... I-\" she whispered as he began on her other arm, dropping the brooches onto the tray next to her half-empty goblet.\n \"This is for you, Melidulci,\" he said softly, his lips brushing the arch of her clavicle, as light and tantalizing as the feathers she sometimes used on her more adventurous clients.\n \"I ...\" She took a long, uneven breath as he unfastened the last brooch, and the silk scrooped down to her waist. For several heartbeats she remained immobile, unable to bring herself to do those things she was used to doing for her clients. Instead, she closed her eyes so she could experience his touch more fully, her senses heightened by his nearness, and his exhilarating, unhurried exploration of her body. Gradually, she sank back on the couch, her clothes falling away from her upper body; her increasing excitement imparted a paradoxical languor, heightening her delight in surrender to his ministrations. She felt Sanct-Franciscus untie her elegant belt, and almost at once her tunica was gone and she was lying naked before him. She started to sit up, to conceal her scars with her arms, but she was stopped as Sanct-Franciscus put his hand on her shoulder, using just enough strength to keep her from trying to hide.\n \"You have nothing to fear,\" he said, one knee on the couch beside her as he bent forward to kiss her breasts.\n \"The scars-\"\n \"You have nothing to fear,\" he repeated, and kissed her mouth with slow, delicious, insouciant torment, banishing all her unease and replacing it with steadily increasing exaltation as she gave herself once again to the bounty of gratification.\n As he expanded his exquisite tantalizations, Melidulci felt the first surge of pleasure engulf her, a quivering that promised a culmination that she had rarely experienced. She tried to find something to say to Sanct-Franciscus that would lend him support, but the words slipped away, borne on ethereal wings. The only sound she offered was a soft moan of utter lightsomeness as his hands and kisses made their way down her body to the cleft at the top of her thighs. In a still, quiet part of her mind, Melidulci chided herself for surrendering so completely to Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 caresses; she had been pleasuring men for many years, and knew most of the arts that could be used to give satisfaction, yet here she was, like a girl newly taught, more willing than knowing, and filled with eagerness and novelty. It was not as if she knew nothing of the satisfaction Sanct-Franciscus\u0027 skills could impart, either, for they had lain together four times to fulfillment, but-The sensible voice was stilled as she felt his hands slide between her legs. Now she was enthralled by the expansion of her perceptions, so that the lightest touch sent waves through her body that amazed her; the flick of his tongue in the soft folds of the portal of her body shuddered through the marrow of her bones, leaving her delectably amplectant, her arms wrapped around him. The more he did to rouse her, the greater the intensity of her gratification grew, and the more she yearned for the ineffable moment when she would be transfixed with culmination. Subtle and daring at once, his hands and mouth elicited every refinement of sensual frenzy, evoking elation she had never achieved, igniting her body in escalating rapture until she cried out in release; her flesh, shaken into transports, rode the ecstatic pulse of her passion to heights that had eluded her before, but now became the apogee of her existence, leaving her all but oblivious to Sanct-Franciscus, bent over her, his lips on her neck.\n While she lay replete on her couch, gradually coming back to herself, she tried to think of something to do to express her immense satisfaction. Finally, as she was able to sit up, she looked up at him. \"How am I to give you fulfillment?\"\n He dropped on one knee beside her couch to gather up her silken tunica. \"You have done so already-better than you know.\"\n \"Oh, yes,\" she said with a suggestion of a smile. \"You always tell me that you have what I have; that your pleasure is my pleasure. I trust you will not mind if I am willing to believe you?\" She stretched, her body still sinuous in the aftermath of satisfaction.\n \"I tell you because it is true,\" he said with such complete simplicity that she began to think that it was so.\n \"You could persuade me,\" she allowed as she smoothed stray damp, pale tendrils of hair back from her face.\n \"What reason would I have to prevaricate?\" he countered, his musical voice lightly teasing.\n \"If you say so, I suppose I must accept it,\" she said, and licked her lips with the tip of her tongue; then she admitted, \"I don\u0027t know if you will mind, considering what has just passed between us, but I find I\u0027m hungry ... still.\"\n \"Then eat,\" said Sanct-Franciscus, amusement lighting his dark eyes. \"You mustn\u0027t exhaust yourself on my account.\" He rose and went to the low table, prepared to serve her wine or food.\n \"Would that I could,\" she said with a toss of her head.\n \"Exhaust yourself?\" He gestured to the waiting dishes.\n She shook her head. \"No-do anything on your account. You disarm all obligation.\" She selected an egg-half and began to eat.\n \"Why would you want to do anything on my account?\" he asked, mildly startled by her remark.\n It took her a short while to answer. \"Because you have done so much for me.\" She swallowed the last of the egg with a generous sip of wine.\n He leaned toward her once more, his gaze compelling. \"I do not expect you to keep a tally of obligation, Melidulci. I do not bargain my affections. What I offer-such as it is-I offer freely. It is not necessary for you to concern yourself with such balances, and it could come to distort our dealings together.\"\n \"I hadn\u0027t meant-\" She shivered a bit, aware that this had unusual importance to him. \"No, I suppose I did. For a woman in my profession ... it is the kind of assumption we all make.\"\n He went on, \"What we have is a gift, you and I; we can touch one another. Be thankful that it exists, not the number of times and conditions under which we enjoy it.\"\n She pressed her mouth closed, not trusting herself to speak. Finally she refilled her goblet and picked it up. \"May Fortuna show you favor,\" she said as she took a long sip.\n \"And you,\" he responded, ducking his head in place of taking a drink.\n \"What are you thinking?\" Melidulci asked after a brief silence; she had seen the suggestion of a frown on his brow.\n \"I was thinking that you may still be at risk here,\" said Sanct-Franciscus. \"I would advise you to engage guards to protect you.\"\n \"And where might I find such dependable guards?\" She was dismayed to realize that she expected him to answer her.\n Sanct-Franciscus cocked his head. \"Would you like me to inquire for you? I would be happy to do it.\"\n This calm inquiry took her aback. She knew that it was something she had hoped he would help with, but the directness of his question disarmed her. \"I ... I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Because you are unsure about wanting guards, or because you are unsure about permitting me to engage them for you?\" His question was lightly asked, and the glint in his eye was affectionate, but she responded as if she had been rebuked.\n \"If I need guards, I will manage them for myself, Patronus,\" she announced, and then, to her shock, began to weep.\n Sanct-Franciscus came to her side, his manner thoughtful; he laid his small, beautiful hands on her shoulders. \"From your own hiring, or from mine, you would be well-advised to employ guards, Melidulci. You cannot spend all your days in a rapture of fear. It will rob you of all you are.\"\n She stared at him. \"I\u0027m not afraid,\" she insisted, although her voice shook. \"I\u0027m not.\"\n A century ago, she could have said it and been sensible, but now, with Roma so much changed from that time, he knew that her situation was precarious. \"If you deny it, you give it strength, and add to its impact.\"\n \"I must resist it,\" she said doggedly, dabbing with her silken tunica at her eyes. \"I will not give in.\"\n \"You would do better to admit it, and to see it for what it is, and make preparation against it,\" he said tenderly, bending to kiss her forehead. \"A goat in the night becomes a troupe of bear if you do not shine a lamp on it.\"\n She made a terrible mull of laughing. \"You always have such good advice,\" she said as she set the last bit of egg aside, her appetite gone as quickly as it had come.\n \"Not advice: concern,\" he corrected her gently, sitting on the couch and folding her into his arms, her pale hair brushing against his cheek as she clung to him in the deepening night.\n Text of a letter from Atta Olivia Clemens at Ravenna to Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus in Roma, carried by private courier to Roma.\n To my most dear friend, currently calling himself Ragoczy Germainus Sanct-Franciscus, but who still is Ragoczy Sanct\u0027 Germain Franciscus to me, and who is abiding in my house near the Temple of Hercules in Roma, the greetings of Atta Olivia Clemens, accompanying the sworn copies of my claims to the house, as well as its history, my own records of payments for the last five years, beyond what you have there, and witnessed copies of my own registration of household.\n It seems to me that you have encountered the new manner of bureaucracy which has come about in Roma since they made the earnings of the decuriae dependent on the services they render. If Roma were not corrupt before, it is so now-how could it be otherwise: this policy has made corruption almost necessary for the government to function. More fools they!\n You will tell me-and beyond cavil correctly-that you have seen worse in other times and places. I do not doubt it is true, but I am most dismayed that it should happen to my city, to my home. I know that change comes to all things, but I had hoped that Roma could resist the rot a little longer. Ravenna is much the same, of course, with the addition of piracy and smuggling from the port, but it is smaller, and I have (thanks to you) more than sufficient funds to purchase my privacy and a guard for me while I live here. We still have to deal with judicial chicanery, debasement of coins, capricious taxes, and rogues in high places, but for the time being, I believe I am as safe as a woman alone may be in the Empire of Roma in this time. Ravenna may not be as splendid as Roma, but Roma has lost some of its splendor since I came to your life, more than a century-and-a-half ago.\n And now, a fourteen-year-old youth from Syria is Caesar! Varius Avitus Bassianus, a self-proclaimed son of Caracalla, who is doubtless a tool of his mother, his grandmother, and who knows whomelse, is the leader of all the Empire. Grandnephew-by marriage-of Septimius Severus: a recommendation, oh, most surely. What other claims might he put forth? I would laugh if I were not a Roman. And what is this nonsense about calling himself after the Syrian sun god? Isn\u0027t Apollo grand enough for him, that he must style himself Heliogabalus. Apollonius would be audacious enough, but at least it would be Roman.\n Enough of these lowering reflections. I am in no position to change what has happened, and thinking will only cause me to grieve for Roma. So: I have retained a local fellow-Catalinus by aname-to serve as my steward. He is able to read and write and he knows numbers. He has no family in the region, and is in need of work; he is not uncomely, and he is taken with me, so I am fairly sure he will not cheat me too egregiously, or tell my secrets to the world. I trust he will be inclined to remain with me for some time, for I would not like to have to train a new steward again for a decade. As to the possibilities for more between us, I will tell you that I have hopes that he will not be too dismayed when he learns of my nature, and my inclinations. I grow weary of visiting men in their dreams. You told me that I would come to long for knowing embraces, and so it is.\n Speaking of stewards, Rogerian-or Rugeri, as he styles himself just now-has written to me from Alexandria, saying that two of your ships have been delayed and possibly lost. I will include that letter with this one, as he has asked me to do. He believes four of his letters have not reached you, and that may be a troublesome indication, for it means that his letters are being seized, not merely lost at sea, for the ship carrying one of the letters reaclied Ostia and returned to Alexandria unharmed. Also, another one of your ships has been taken by pirates, and Rogerian would like you to permit him to ransom the crew. I have assured him that you would expect him to do so, in case your letter to him fails to reach him.\n I must tell you that I feel a certain fellowship with Rogerian, for we came to you, each in our way, at almost the same time. In the last century and more he has shown himself to be reliable, honorable, sensible, and loyal. I do not think you could find a better bondsman anywhere, but I will admit that my opinion is not completely disinterested. I see what he does for you, and I feel a lamentable twinge of jealousy. Not that I would expect you to give up Rogerian, but I would like to have a bondsman of my own one day.\n This piracy that Rogerian mentions is a growing threat, and nothing is being done to contain it. On land, gangs of bandits haunt the roads unchallenged while the Legions are beaten back on all our borders. A fine thing for Roma! Magna Mater, but I could cry for vexation, if only I had tears to shed. That such lawlessness would be allowed in the Empire, and that the people should acquiesce in it! The Praetorians swagger and boast as if Roma were still intact, as if our laws were still upheld, as if the Senate had any power beyond self-congratulations. Only the Vestal Virgins have upheld their integrity, and with the rising popularity of Christians, even that is being undermined. I must be grateful, I suppose, that these conditions did not prevail when I was alive, for then I should never have been able to escape my husband, no matter what you may have done to help me. My death would have been the True Death, and no one would have called Cornelius Justus Silius to book for it.\n If you will permit me to repeat some of your advice to me: do not linger if the tide turns against you. Foreigners are not as welcome in Roma as they were in my breathing days, and the city is more volatile than when you were last there; as you have said yourself, there is depravity that comes from desperation everywhere-think of the zeal of the foreign religions, and the increasing numbers of soothsayers in the city-and once the people are sparked to ferocity they are more dangerous than tigers in the Flavian Circus. You encouraged me to be prepared to leave quickly, and covertly, which I have done; I also have plans to depart Ravenna, should it become necessary. I now remind you to make the same preparations, for you are as exposed as I was. Come here to me if you need a place to retreat, and I will keep you as safe as my name and gold can. It is the least I can do for you.\n This carries my undying love to you, as well as my affectionate castigations, and promises you that my fealty is true, come what may. This, then, by my own hand, and with the fullness of my devotion, on the first day of November in the 971st Year of the City,\n Olivia \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19/page-8.html","bookId":2502,"book":{"id":2502,"title":"Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19)","description":"Storyline: \n Roman Dusk (Saint-Germain #19) \n Rome is crumbling. The child-emperor, Heliogabalus, diverts the Roman populace with parties, circuses, and celebrations, while his mother and grandmother jockey for power behind the scenes. The government is riddled with scandal and no business is conducted without bribes which grow ever larger. Religions joust for prominence, with factions of Christians seeking to overthrow the ancient Roman pantheon. Courtesans, once honored for their skills and protected by special guards, have become targets of opprobrium. \n The vampire Ragoczy Germanius Sanct\u0027 Franciscus, already subject to extra taxes and regulations because he is a foreigner, falls under the maleficent eye of Telemachus Batsho, a minor functionary who dreams of power and wealth. When Franciscus thwarts his attempts to extort ever-increasing sums from a young Roman of good birth, Batsho swears revenge. Franciscus finds his activities closely monitored and is accused of treason and conspiracy. His friends, threatened with similar scrutiny, abandon him to Batsho\u0027s mercies or urge him to leave the Eternal City. \n But Franciscus has many ties to Rome. He has taken under his protection a beautiful courtesan who was brutally beaten by the very men who should have been protecting her. She has been the vampire\u0027s sustenance for many months. \n Franciscus is also held in the city by the plight of the family Laelius. The Domina\u0027s health is failing despite the vampire\u0027s great medical skills; her son has converted to Christianity and rails against his mother\u0027s beliefs; her daughter Ignatia, who has sacrified her own life to care for her mother, realizes that when her mother dies, her fate will rest in the hands of her increasingly fanatical brother. \n Determined to claim pleasure for herself, Ignatia invites Franciscus\u0027s attentions, inflaming him with the power of her untapped sexuality. Unfortunately, they are not unobserved, and their simple yet powerful act of love sparks a conflagration that destroys Ignatia\u0027s family and nearly brings about the vampire\u0027s True Death.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/roman-dusk-saint-germain-19.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:00:28 PM"}}
