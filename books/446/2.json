{"id":42843,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\"I would not repeat myself if it were not for the urgency of this matter.\" Dr. Haenlingen\u0027s voice hardly echoed in the square small room. She stood staring out at the forests below, the coiling gray-green trees, the plants and rough growth. A small woman whose carriage was always, publicly, stiff and erect, whose iron-gray eyes seemed as solid as ice, she might years before have trained her voice to sound improbably flat and formal. Now the formality was dissolving in anger. \"As you know, the mass of citizens throughout the Confederation are a potential source of explosive difficulty, and our only safety against such an explosion lies in complete and continuing silence.\" Abruptly, she turned away from the window. \"Have you got that, Norma?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Norma Fredericks nodded, her trace poised over the waiting pad. \"Yes, Dr. Haenlingen. Of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Haenlingen\u0027s laugh was a dry rustle. \"Good Lord, girl,\" she said. \"Are you afraid of me, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Norma shook her head instantly, then stopped and almost smiled. \"I suppose I am, Doctor,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t quite know why—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Authority figure, parent-surrogate, phi factor—there\u0027s no mystery about the why, Norma. If you\u0027re content with jargon, and we know all the jargon, don\u0027t we?\" Now instead of a laugh it was a smile, surprisingly warm but very brief. \"We ought to, after all; we ladle it out often enough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Norma said: \"There\u0027s certainly no real reason for fear. I don\u0027t want you to think—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I never think. I reason when I must, react when I can.\" She paused. \"Sometimes, Norma, it strikes me that the Psychological Division hasn\u0027t really kept track of its own occupational syndromes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" Norma waited, a study in polite attention. The trace fell slowly in her hand to the pad on her knees and rested there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ask you if you\u0027re afraid of me and I get the beginnings of a self-analysis,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. She walked three steps to the desk and sat down behind it, her hands clasped on the surface, her eyes staring at the younger woman. \"If I\u0027d let you go on I suppose you could have given me a yard and a half of assorted psychiatric jargon, complete with suggestions for a change in your pattern.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I only—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You only reacted the way a good Psychological Division worker is supposed to react, I imagine.\" The eyes closed for a second, opened again. \"You know, Norma, I could have dictated this to a tape and had it sent out automatically. Did you stop to think why I wanted to talk it out to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a message to the Confederation,\" Norma said slowly. \"I suppose it\u0027s important, and you wanted—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Importance demands accuracy,\" Dr. Haenlingen broke in. \"Do you think you can be more accurate than a tape record?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A second of silence went by. \"I don\u0027t know, then,\" Norma said at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wanted reaction,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"I wanted somebody\u0027s reaction. But I can\u0027t get yours. As far as I can see you\u0027re the white hope of the Psychological Division—but even you are afraid of me, even you are masking any reaction you might have for fear the terrifying Dr. Anna Haenlingen won\u0027t like it.\" She paused. \"Good Lord, girl, I\u0027ve got to know if I\u0027m getting through!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Norma took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said at last. \"I\u0027ll try to give you what you want—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There you go again.\" Dr. Haenlingen shoved back her chair and stood up, marched to the window and stared out at the forest again. Below, the vegetation glowed in the daylight. She shook her head slowly. \"How can you give me what I want when I don\u0027t know what I want? I need to know what you think, how you react. I\u0027m not going to bite your head off if you do something wrong: there\u0027s nothing wrong that you can do. Except not react at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Norma said again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Haenlingen\u0027s shoulders moved, up and down. It might have been a sigh. \"Of course you are,\" she said in a gentler voice. \"I\u0027m sorry, too. It\u0027s just that matters aren\u0027t getting any better—and one false move could crack us wide open.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know,\" Norma said. \"You\u0027d think people would understand—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"People,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, \"understand very little. That\u0027s what we\u0027re here for, Norma: to make them understand a little more. To make them understand, in fact, what we want them to understand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The truth,\" Norma said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" Dr. Haenlingen said, almost absently. \"The truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This time there was a longer pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shall we get on with it, then?\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready,\" Norma said. \"\u0027Complete and continuing silence.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Haenlingen paused. \"What?... Oh. It should be perfectly obvious that the average Confederation citizen, regardless of his training or information, would not understand the project under development here no matter how carefully it was explained to him. The very concepts of freedom, justice, equality under the law, which form the cornerstone of Confederation law and, more importantly, Confederation societal patterns, will prevent him from judging with any real degree of objectivity our actions on Fruyling\u0027s World, or our motives.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Actions,\" Norma muttered. \"Motives.\" The trace flew busily over the pad, leaving its shorthand trail. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was agreed in the original formation of our project here that silence and secrecy were essential to the project\u0027s continuance. Now, in the third generation of that project, the wall of silence has been breached and I have received repeated reports of rumors regarding our relationship with the natives. The very fact that such rumors exist is indication enough that an explosive situation is developing. It is possible for the Confederation to be forced to the wall on this issue, and this issue alone: I cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that such a possibility exists. Therefore—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Doctor,\" Norma said. \\n\\n \\n\\n The dictation stopped. Dr. Haenlingen turned slowly. \"Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wanted reactions, didn\u0027t you?\" Norma said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" The word was not unfriendly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Norma hesitated for a second. Then she burst out: \"But they\u0027re so far away! I mean—there isn\u0027t any reason why they should really care. They\u0027re busy with their own lives, and I don\u0027t really see why whatever\u0027s done here should occupy them—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re not seeing them,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Because you\u0027re thinking of the Confederation, not the people who compose the Confederation, all of the people on Mars, and Venus, the moons and Earth. The Confederation itself—the government—really doesn\u0027t care. Why should it? But the people do—or would.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" Norma said, and then: \"Oh. Of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"They hear about freedom, and all the rest, as soon as they\u0027re old enough to hear about anything. It\u0027s part of every subject they study in school, it\u0027s part of the world they live in, it\u0027s like the air they breathe. They can\u0027t question it: they can\u0027t even think about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And, of course, if they hear about Fruyling\u0027s World—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be any way to disguise the fact,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"In the long run, there never is. And the fact will shock them into action. As long as they continue to live in that air of freedom and justice and equality under the law, they\u0027ll want to stop what we\u0027re doing here. They\u0027ll have to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see,\" Nonna said. \"Of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Haenlingen, still looking out at the world below, smiled faintly. \"Slavery,\" she said, \"is such an ugly word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2155/60918.html","bookId":446,"book":{"id":446,"title":"Slave Planet","description":"简介： I would not repeat myself if it were not for the urgency of this matter.
