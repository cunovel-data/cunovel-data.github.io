{"id":42853,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"The work went on, for Cadnan as well as for the masters. Days passed and he began to improve slightly: he received no further discipline, and he was beginning to settle into a routine. Only thoughts of Dara disturbed him—those, and the presence of Marvor, who was still apparently waiting to make good his incomprehensible threat. Marvor had said he was going to leave, but he still appeared every evening in the same room. Cadnan had hardly dared to question him, for fear of being drawn into the plan, whatever it was: he could only wait and watch and wish for someone to talk to. But, of course, there was no one. And then, one day during the first part of his working shift, a master came into the room, the very master who had gone with Cadnan through his training. \"You\u0027re Cadnan?\" he asked. Cadnan said: \"I am Cadnan.\" The master beckoned through the open door of Cadnan\u0027s working-room, and two more masters appeared, strange ones, leading between them an elder. The elder, Cadnan saw at once, had lived through many matings: the green skin of his arms was turning to silver, and his eye was no longer bright, but dulling fast with age. He looked at the working-room and at the young Albert with blank caution. \"This one is called Gornom,\" the master said. \"He\u0027ll be with you when you work. He\u0027s going to help you work—you can teach him all he has to know. Just make sure you don\u0027t let him handle the buttons until we give you the word. All right?\" Cadnan understood. \"All right,\" he said, and the three masters left the room without more words. The door shut behind them and Gornom visibly relaxed. Yet there was still wariness behind the old eye. \"I work in the field,\" he said after a second. \"I am good worker in the field.\" Cadnan knew from gossip about the field: that was the place where the metal lay. Alberts worked there, digging it up and bringing it to the buildings where Cadnan and many like him took over the job. He nodded slowly, bending his body from the waist instead of from the neck like the masters, or Marvor. \"If you are in the field,\" he said, \"why do you come here? This is not a place for diggers.\" \"I am brought here,\" Gornom said. \"I am an elder many times. What the masters say, I do. Now they say I come here, and I come.\" Cadnan looked doubtful. \"You are to work with me?\" \"So the masters say.\" That was unanswerable, and Cadnan accepted it. He flicked a glance at the TV screen which showed him the smelting process, and leaped for the buttons. After a few minutes of action he was finished: there was a slight breathing-space. \"I am to tell you what to do,\" he said. Gornom looked grave. \"I see what it is you do,\" he said. \"It is a lesson. When you act for the masters, the great machines obey you.\" \"It is true,\" Cadnan said. \"This is the lesson,\" Gornom said slowly, as if it were truly important. \"We are shown the machines so that we may learn to be like the machines. When the master tells us what to do, we are to do it. There is nothing else.\" Cadnan thought about that. It made sense: it made a structure he could understand, and it made the world a less confusing place. \"You have said a truth,\" he judged at last. \"It is one of many truths,\" Gornom said. And that was an invitation, Cadnan recognized. He hesitated no more than a second. \"Where may I learn the others?\" But Gornom didn\u0027t answer, and Cadnan\u0027s breathing-space was over. He had to be back at the board, pushing buttons, watching carefully. Gornom stood behind him, peering over his shoulder with a cloudy eye. Neither said a word until the new spell of work was over. Then Cadnan repeated his question. \"It is not for all,\" Gornom said distantly. \"One must be chosen.\" \"You have come to me,\" Cadnan said. \"You have been sent to me. Is this what you call chosen?\" It was the right answer, perhaps the only right answer. Gornom pretended to consider the matter for a minute, but his mind was already made up. \"We are above you, on the floor over yours,\" he said. \"When our work is finished I will take you there.\" Cadnan imagined a parade of new truths, a store of knowledge that would lay all his questions to rest and leave him, as after a meal, entirely satisfied. He went back to work and contemplated the first of the truths: he was to be like the machine. He promised himself he would try to imitate the machine, doing only what the masters ordered. And for the rest of that day, indeed, life seemed to make perfect calming sense. But, after all, Gornom was only an elder and not a master. He could be wrong. The doubt appeared at the end of the day, but by then Gornom had the younger Albert in tow. They took the elevator up one flight and went to Gornom\u0027s room: the novelty of all of this excited Cadnan so that he nearly forgot his new doubts. They shrank perceptibly without disappearing altogether. Gornom opened the door of the new room. Inside, Cadnan saw six elders, sitting in a circle on the floor. The circle, incomplete, was open toward the door, and all six big eyes were staring at the newcomers. The floor was nearly bare: the leaves had been brushed into mounds that lay in the corners. Without a word, Gornom sat in the circle and motioned Cadnan to a place beside him. Moving slowly and uncertainly, Cadnan came forward and sat down. There was a second of absolute silence. One of the other elders said: \"You bring a new one to us?\" \"I bring a new one,\" Gornom said. The other elder, leaning forward from the waist, peered at Cadnan. His eye was larger than normal, and glittering cold. Cadnan, awestruck, neither spoke nor moved, and the elder regarded him for a time and then said abruptly: \"Not all are called to the truth.\" \"He has been called,\" Gornom said. \"He has been chosen.\" \"How is he chosen?\" Gornom explained. When he had finished, a silence thick as velvet descended upon the room. Then, very suddenly, all the elders spoke at once. \"May the masters live forever.\" Cadnan, by this time, was nearly paralyzed with fright. He sat very still. The elders continued, in a slow, leaden chorus: \"May the masters live forever. \"May the words live forever. \"May the lessons live forever. \"May the truths live forever.\" Then the velvet silence came down again, but the words rang through it faintly until Gornom broke the spell with speech. \"The young one has come to learn. He has come to know the truths.\" He looked around at the others and then went on: \"His name is Cadnan. He wishes to have your names. Let him have your names.\" The elder who had spoken first identified himself as Lonak. The others gave their names in order: Dalor, Puna, Grudoc, Burlog, Montun. Cadnan stared with fascinated eyes at Puna, who was older than anyone he had ever seen. His skin was nearly all white, and in the dim room it seemed to have a faint shine. His voice was very high and thin, like a wind sighing in tall tree-branches. Cadnan shivered, but didn\u0027t take his eye from Puna until, as if at a signal, all the elders rose. Awkwardly, then, Cadnan rose with them, again confused and still frightened. He saw Gornom raise his hands over his head and chant: \"Tall are the masters.\" All the others repeated the words. \"Wise are the masters.\" Cadnan, this time, repeated the phrase with the elders. \"Good are the masters.\" When the antiphon had been delivered Gornom waited a full second and then fell prostrate to the floor. The others followed his example, except for Cadnan, who, afraid to let himself fall on bare metal, crouched down slowly instead. \"Weak are the slaves,\" Gornom whispered. The answer was a whisper, too. \"Small are the slaves.\" The others whispered. \"They are like small ones all the days of their lives, and only the masters are elders.\" \"The masters are elders.\" \"As the machine obeys,\" Gornom said, \"so the slave obeys. As the tree obeys, so the slave obeys. As the metal obeys, so the slave obeys. As the ground obeys, so the slave obeys.\" \"So the slave obeys.\" Then there was silence again, not as profound as before. Through it, Cadnan could hear the others whispering, but he couldn\u0027t quite catch their words. He was later told what praying was, though he never had a chance to practice it. And then everyone returned to the original circle, and squatted. In what was almost a normal tone Gornom said: \"Here is our new one. He must be told.\" Puna himself rose. \"I will tell him.\" And Cadnan, frightened by the very look of the elder, could do nothing but follow him as he beckoned and went to a corner near a mound of leaves. The others, scattered, were eating. Cadnan picked up a leaf, but Puna took it gently out of his hand. \"We do not eat until it is over,\" he said quietly. Cadnan accepted this without words, and Puna told him the legend. During the entire tale, Cadnan, stock-still, didn\u0027t even think of interrupting. At first his attention wandered to the leaves, but as Puna\u0027s voice went on he listened more and more closely, and even his fright began to leave him under the legend\u0027s fascination. \"Long ago, the masters come to the world, sent by the Great Elder. We are no more than children. We do not work, we do nothing except eat and sleep and live out our lives in the world. The Great Elder makes us the gift of talking and the gift of trees, and he makes the rules of the trees. \"Then he does nothing more for us. First we must become more than children, more than small ones. \"For this he sends the masters. \"The masters are good because they show us work and give us machines that have power. Our power is over the masters because of the machines. But we may not use such power. They are elder to us: they are wiser than we are. Only when we become so wise we use power against them, and in that day master and slave are one. In that day the Great Elder returns to his small ones. \"In this time there is the work, and the work makes us always more like the masters. We live in the buildings like masters. We work with machines like masters. We do what the masters say. Soon we are all the same. \"No one can tell when we are like masters in all things. We know of it when the Great Elder returns to us. All must watch and wait for that day. In this time, we only remember and tell ourselves the truths over and over. There are many truths and some I can not speak. Here are the others: \"The masters are our elders. \"The machines are under obedience to us while we obey the masters. \"The Great Elder wishes our obedience to the masters. \"If we disobey the masters the machines and the trees will not obey us, and there will be no more work and no small ones. For this is the order of the world: some obeying and some to be obeyed. It is visible and plain. When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\" Puna paused, and then repeated the last sentence. \"When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\" \"It is true,\" Cadnan said excitedly. \"It is true. Yet there is more truth—\" \"There is,\" Puna said soberly. \"We meet again in five days\u0027 time. I can count five days, and so the others will know, and you will know. At this next meeting you will be told more truths.\" His smile was thin and distant. \"Now eat.\" Cadnan reached numbly for a leaf and, without thinking, began to nibble. The world had been set in order: he had no more questions now. Instead, he felt empty spaces, waiting to be filled with the great knowledge of Puna and of Gornom and all the others, at the next meeting. And at other meetings, after that.... He put that thought away: it was too much and too large. The one certain thing was that in five days\u0027 time (whenever that was) he would know more. In five days they would all meet again. He hoped five days was not too long. As matters turned out, of course, he need not have worried. The meeting he was waiting for never happened. And, after that, there were no more meetings at all. PUBLIC OPINION THREE Being excerpts from memo directives sent between executives of Associated Metallic Products, Ltd., a corporation having its main offices within Dome Two, Luna City, Luna, and associated offices on all three inhabited planets, the memo directives being dated between May fourteenth and May twenty-first, in the Year of the Confederation two hundred and ten. TO: John Harrison FROM: Fredk. Ramsbotham RE: Metals supplies \u0026 shipment It having come to my attention that the process of metals shipment is in danger because of a threat to the materials and procurement divisions of AMP, Ltd., I wish to advise you, as current Chairman of the Board, of the nature of the emergency, and request your aid in drawing up plans to deal with it. According to reports from our outside operatives, and such statistical checking as we have been able to use in a matter of this nature, there exists a strong possibility that present procurement procedures regarding our raw materials may at any moment be abrogated by act of the Confederation government. The original motive for this action would seem to be a rising tide of public unrest, sparked apparently by chance disclosure of our procurement procedures. That the public unrest may very soon reach the point at which Confederation notice, and hence Confederation action, may be taken is the best judgment both of our outside operatives and of our statistical department. In order to deal with this unprecedented emergency, it would be advisable to have your thoughts on the matter. With these in hand.... TO: Fred Ramsbotham FROM: John Harrison RE: Your memo May 14 My God, Fred, I haven\u0027t seen such a collection of verbiage since Latin class. Why not say what you mean? People are calling the setup on Fruyling\u0027s World slavery, and slavery is a nasty word. Let\u0027s get together for a talk—and what\u0027s with the high-sounding guff? You sound sore about something: what? TO: James Oliver Gogarty FROM: Leonard Offutt RE: Statistical findings ... The situation is serious, J. O., and there\u0027s no getting around it. If the Government has to take action there\u0027s only one way (given current majorities) they\u0027re going to be able to move, and that\u0027s to declare Fruyling\u0027s World a protectorate, or some such (get your lawyers to straighten out the terminology: in plain and simple English, a ward of the state), and \"administer\" the place for the best interests of the natives. Get that: the natives. Never mind us, never mind AMP, never mind the metals we need. No, the Government will step in and take all that away from us in the interests of a bunch of silly green-looking monsters who can barely talk and can\u0027t, as near as I can see, think at all. Statistics doesn\u0027t give us much of a chance of heading them off. As a matter of fact, any recommended course of action has better than a 50% chance of making matters even worse. And if you don\u0027t think they can be worse, take a look at the attached sheet, which.... TO: John Harrison FROM: Fredk. Ramsbotham RE: Your memo May 15 Have you never heard of the Confederation impounding records? Or these memos, for instance? TO: Fred Ramsbotham FROM: John Harrison RE: Your memo May 15 Have you never heard of AMP burning them, you silly damn fool? Now let\u0027s get together for a talk. TO: James Oliver Gogarty FROM: Gregory Whiting and staff RE: Your memo May 17 Pressure put on Confederation executives and members of the Senate might convince the Confederation that, without a fight, Fruyling\u0027s World would not surrender to Confederation control. It might not be advisable to begin such a fight. Even with modern methods of transport and training, the weapons gap between the Confederation and Fruyling\u0027s World is a severe handicap. In other words, J. O., if it came to a showdown the people here don\u0027t think we stand a fair chance of coming out on top. You\u0027d better rethink your position, then.... TO: James Oliver Gogarty FROM: John Harrison RE: Fruyling\u0027s World Interoffice guff says you\u0027re planning definite moves on your own, J. O., and against some opposition. I\u0027m still Chairman of the Board around here, and I intend to use power if I have to. The best advice I can get tells me your plans are unadvisable. Get it through your head that this has nothing to do with the Board elections. This is a serious matter. I can stop you, J. O., and don\u0027t think I won\u0027t if it comes to that. But I don\u0027t want to make threats. There must be something we can do—but we\u0027re going to have to devote more thought to the whole matter first. TO: James Oliver Gogarty FROM: Leonard Offutt RE: Statistical findings Chances of such pressure succeeding are, according to derived figures, 37%. Chances of the pressure leading to actual attack on Fruyling\u0027s World (see attached sheet) are 58%. We cannot advise.... TO: Fredk. Ramsbotham FROM: James Oliver Gogarty RE: Attached statistical findings ... Of course it\u0027s a risk, Frederick, but we\u0027re in the risk-taking business, and we always were, as your father used to say, and mine too. Between us, John is a cautious old man, and the rest of the Board is beginning to appreciate that. By next year the entire situation may have changed. I\u0027m asking for your support, then, as a matter of practical politics. In a risky matter like this one, support can make all the difference between.... TO: James Oliver Gogarty FROM: John Harrison RE: My memo May 19 J. O., I mean it. Now lay off. TO: Williston Reed FROM: John Harrison RE: Current memo series As you know, I\u0027m keeping you up to date whenever I have a minute between appointments: a publicity chief ought to know everything, inside as well as public-issue material, if only so he can be conscious of what to hide. I\u0027ve tried to work with you as well as I can, and if there are delays in reporting, you\u0027ll understand that pressure of other duties.... ... The story behind all of this is simple enough. The takeover Gogarty and Ramsbotham have been trying to pull is interfering with practical business. Frankly, AMP\u0027S competitors are happy enough to jump in and stir the pot: I think they\u0027ve been buying up Senators here and there (for which there is, God knows, enough precedent; the entire Senate hasn\u0027t been bought since the Dedrick mutiny forty years back but you don\u0027t need the entire Senate if you have a few key men, and I\u0027ve always thought Dedrick\u0027s lawyers were wasteful), and beyond what the competition\u0027s been active in, there are always the fanatics. Freedom for all—you know the sort of thing. Now the big danger is that if R. and G. succeed in keeping things messed up the rest of the metals boys will step in, push the government into the right moves, and kill Fruyling\u0027s World deader than Dedrick himself. Which (according to the statistical breakdown) won\u0027t put us into the bankruptcy courts, but will slide us from a first-or-second spot to a ninth-or-tenth one. The big question is whether you\u0027d rather be a small frog in a big puddle or the reverse. Me, I\u0027d rather be a big frog in a big puddle than any other combination I can think of, and in spite of everything I think I\u0027m going to go on being just that. Fruyling\u0027s World has been around for a long time, but the current AMP fight gives the competition the opportunity they need, and they\u0027re pushing it. If we can weather the storm.... Well, I\u0027m being gloomy. Of course we can weather the storm. I\u0027ll swing Gogarty back, and that will leave Ramsbotham nowhere to go.... TO: John Harrison FROM: Fredk. Ramsbotham RE: Fruyling\u0027s World ... Support of the suggestion put forward by Mr. Gogarty at the last Board meeting was not, believe me, given without grave consideration. Now that the matter has been decided, I hope we can all pull together like team-mates, and \"let the dead past bury its dead\". I\u0027m sure that.... TO: Fred Ramsbotham FROM: John Harrison RE: Your memo May 21 I\u0027m worrying a little more about burying some of the currently living—our own men on Fruyling\u0027s World. I\u0027ve got to ask you to reconsider.... TO: All news services, for immediate release FROM: Williston Reed As almost his first act on taking his position as Chairman of the Board of Associated Metallic Products, Ltd., Frederick Ramsbotham today issued a statement of policy regarding \"interference by Confederation governmental officials\" in what he termed the \"private business of AMP.\" Mr. Ramsbotham, whose recent election came as a surprise to many shareholders, has stated his intention of \"remaining firm in continuance of present policies\" regardless of what he described as \"threats\" from Confederation officials. He states that his duty to shareholders of AMP must include protection of the private and profit-making enterprise being carried on at Fruyling\u0027s World, and that such private concerns are not \"the business of public government.\" As former Chairman of the Board, John Harrison was asked to comment on the position taken by Mr. Ramsbotham. Mr. Harrison stated that he disagreed with the particular stand taken by Mr. Ramsbotham in this matter, but sympathized with his strong feelings of duty toward the shareholders of the concern. Confederation response was reported to be \"immediate and strong\" by sources high in the government, but as yet no final word has been received regarding what action, if any, is contemplated.... TO: Fredk. Ramsbotham FROM: John Harrison SUBJECT: The daily paper Now you\u0027ve torn it. Unless you think we can make money selling weapons to be used against our own people on Fruyling\u0027s World. I\u0027ve sold out my shares as of this morning, Fred. I\u0027m through. I think you are, too—whether you know it or not just yet.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2155/60928.html","bookId":446,"book":{"id":446,"title":"Slave Planet","description":"简介： I would not repeat myself if it were not for the urgency of this matter.
