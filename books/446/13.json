All that she had said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We set up a nice pie-in-the-sky sort of thing, all according to the best theory, just the thing to keep the Alberts happy and satisfied and working hard for us. It started right after the first setup here, and by now I guess the Alberts think they invented it all by themselves, or their Great Elder came down from a tree and told them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s horrible,\" he had said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it is.\" There was a silence. \"But you said it yourself: what can we do?

Albin would have had his fun with Norma, and that would have been that. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it bothered Johnny Dodd. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was still worrying over it, and in spite of himself finding happiness, when the escape came, and the end. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2155/60929.html","bookId":446,"book":{"id":446,"title":"Slave Planet","description":"简介： I would not repeat myself if it were not for the urgency of this matter.
