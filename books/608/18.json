{"id":26320,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII A RESCUE","content":"I had rather expected that when I reached Saintsbury, Barney would be on hand to give an explanation of his urgent message, but no Barney was to be seen. I took a taxi to my office, which was across the street from Barney\u0027s stand. For the first time within my memory, Barney\u0027s stand was shut up and the owner gone. I told the chauffeur to wait and went up to my office. Perhaps Fellows could throw some light on things,--unless he too had disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n Someone was there. I heard talking before I entered,--the loud and unfamiliar tones of a man\u0027s voice. I went in without knocking. Fellows was there, at my desk. His start of surprise turned into unmistakable confusion as he saw me. His own chair was occupied by a pretty girl, whom I recognized at once as Minnie Doty, the houseworker at Mr. Ellison\u0027s, and the girl whom I had seen with Fellows in the park. The third person in the room was a tall man who stood before the window, hat in hand. Evidently he was the man whose voice I had heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I must be going,\" he said now after a moment\u0027s awkward pause, and moved toward the door. As he turned from the window the light fell upon his shaven jaw, blue-black under the skin, and I recognized him. He was the man Barker had addressed with a taunting question about his marriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t leave the room,\" I said quietly, keeping my position before the door. \"Fellows, introduce me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A gleam of amusement crossed Fellows\u0027 sardonic countenance. Leaning against the edge of my desk, he indicated the seated girl with a slight gesture. \"Mr. Hilton, allow me to present you to Mrs. Alfred Barker!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you do?\" the girl said nervously, trying to rise to the social requirements of the occasion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How long have you known this fact, Fellows?\" I asked, watching him closely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For some time,\" he said easily. \"Miss Doty--Mary Doherty her name was originally, but she changed it to Minnie Doty when she ran away from her husband and got a position as houseworker at Mr. Ellison\u0027s--she answered our advertisement for Mary Doherty, to learn something to her advantage. I talked with her,--she didn\u0027t want to be known as Barker\u0027s wife or in any way connected with the inquest, so I agreed to keep her secret for a short time, because--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because she was afraid this man, whose name I don\u0027t know,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Timothy Royce, and I\u0027m in the fire department. Anything else you would like to know?\" the tall man threw in defiantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. I\u0027d like to know if it was you who telephoned to Miss Doty, early in the morning after Barker was killed, \u0027Barker is dead and now you must marry me.\u0027 Was that you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Tim!\" cried Miss Doty,--or whatever she preferred to be called. \"Oh, Tim, I knew they would find it out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What of it?\" said Royce doggedly. \"Anybody is welcome to know that I want to marry you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see. And when Barker asked you in the hall that day if you were married yet, and you drew back to hit him,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was his devilishness,\" said Royce concisely. \"He had just spotted Min and me, and he knew well enough I couldn\u0027t marry while he was above ground, and he was rubbing it in. That night that he was killed, Min and I had gone out to talk things over. I wanted her to run away with me, but she said she couldn\u0027t while he was alive, and the next morning, when the patrolman on our beat told me Barker was dead, I tried to telephone Min. I couldn\u0027t go to her, because I was on duty. I knew it would break her up, being a woman, even though he was ugly as sin to her. Women are that way, I suppose. She even saw about getting him buried. But she was scairt to death of having to come forward and tell things and be talked about and have to appear at the inquest and all that, and letting it be known about her and me,-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where were you the night that Barker was killed?\" I asked abruptly. The man looked honest, there was an honest ring in his voice,--but suppose that after all I had the real murderer here in my office, covering his trail with palaver? Fellows\u0027 eyes were on the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We went out to Lake Park on the electric, Min and me,\" he answered promptly. And then he added unnecessarily, \"We went out on the seven o\u0027clock car and stayed there all evening.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now I know you are lying,\" I said coolly. \"Minnie was at home a few minutes before seven. I saw her let Miss Benbow in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s a lie somewhere, but I\u0027m not fathering it,\" Royce retorted hotly. \"Miss Benbow was waiting in the back entry to be let in when we got there, and it was nearer three than two, because the power gave out and we were tied up for over two hours half way between here and the Park, waiting every minute to go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good heavens! Was Miss Benbow waiting outside till three in the morning?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not outside,--in the back entry. It seems that she came home unexpected, and finding the house shut up, she waited, thinking of course Min would come home some time. And so she did. You see, everybody was away from home that evening, so Minnie was free. But Miss Benbow is a good sort all right. When Min said she\u0027d lose her place if Mrs. Crosswell found out about her going off, Miss Benbow said right off that she wouldn\u0027t tell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I held down any adequate expression of my feelings. I merely asked, \"What sort of a place is the back entry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it was quite clean and nice,\" Minnie spoke up from the depths of her handkerchief. \"There\u0027s an old rocking chair that I sit in to peel potatoes and things like that. She went to sleep in the old chair and didn\u0027t come to no harm. We leave the entry unlocked so that the iceman can get at the refrigerator in the morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The thought of Jean cooped up in that dark back entry until three in the morning, even admitting the comfort of the old rocking chair, was sufficiently disturbing, but aside from that there was something perplexing about the story. Somehow it did not fit in with my previous idea of the events of that night. I struggled to fix the discrepancy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How about Mr. Benbow?\" I asked Minnie suddenly. \"You told me you saw him leave the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When? If you were away from the house before seven,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was just as I was taking Min back home,--a little before three,\" Royce interrupted. \"Just as we were going along the side of the house, past the room Min said was the library, the door opened, and Mr. Benbow came out and ran down the steps. Min didn\u0027t want him to see her, so we stood still in the shadow till he was in the street. Then we went on to the back of the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You gave me to understand that it was earlier in the evening,\" I said reproachfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say when,\" she murmured miserably. \"And I couldn\u0027t tell you it was at three o\u0027clock, or it would all have come out! And it is nobody\u0027s business, anyhow. I wish I had never answered that advertisement of yours!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Fellows stirred slightly and his eye met mine. I caught his hint not to frighten the timid Minnie if I wanted to get any information from her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you tell Miss Benbow that you had seen her brother leave the house at three?\" I asked, to fill time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not then,\" she said meekly. \"I didn\u0027t think about it. I told her the other day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, now you know the whole story, and I guess Min and I will go,\" said Royce,--and this time I did not try to prevent his departure. \"Min wanted me to come, because that young man was hanging around to make her tell about things, and she didn\u0027t know what she had ought to tell and what not. But there ain\u0027t nothing we need to be afraid of coming out, only Min hates to be in the papers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good day,\" I said. \"And thank you for coming.\" As the door closed behind them, I turned to Fellows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Follow them. Don\u0027t lose sight of him. I don\u0027t feel sure yet that he has told the truth. We may need him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" said Fellows. \"I\u0027ve been having her watched for weeks to find out who her young man was. I just worked it out yesterday, and got them here five minutes before you came in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, make sure that we can locate him if necessary,\" I said. This was not the time to discuss his method of handling things. \\n\\n \\n\\n The door had hardly swung shut behind him when it opened again and Barney stumped in,--an anxious-looking Barney. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re here! I missed you,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Barney, what is it?\" I cried. To wait for him to put what he had to say into words seemed suddenly next to impossible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know wot it is, sir, but it\u0027s trouble,\" he said doggedly. \"She guv me a letter for ye, and here it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I tore it open, and behind the incoherent words I seemed to hear Jean\u0027s serious, appealing voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"DEAR MR. HILTON:--I just must write to you, because I couldn\u0027t bear it if you should ever think back and feel hurt because I hadn\u0027t. I can\u0027t tell you all about it, but I want you to remember that I have a reason, a very important reason, for what I am going to do. I can\u0027t explain, but it is on account of Gene. You will know afterwards what I mean. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But there is one other thing I want to tell you. I have just found out that Minnie told you she saw Gene leave the house that night, as she was coming in. That is a mistake,--I didn\u0027t tell her so, because I didn\u0027t know what difference it might make. But Gene was fast asleep on the couch in the library when Minnie and I came into the house (and that was three o\u0027clock) so if she saw someone going off by the side door just before, it wasn\u0027t Gene. You see, it was this way. When I ran back to speak to the girl I thought was Minnie, I found it wasn\u0027t Minnie but a friend of hers who works in the next house, and she said Minnie had gone out but would be right back, so I went into the back entry and waited for her, because I wouldn\u0027t go to Mrs. Whyte\u0027s when she was having a party. And Minnie didn\u0027t come till three. When we got in I saw a light in the library, and I went in, and there was Gene asleep. I kissed him very softly but I didn\u0027t wake him up, because you know how boys are, wanting their sisters to be so awfully dignified. And though I was perfectly safe and comfortable waiting beside the refrigerator, it wasn\u0027t exactly dignified, and Minnie was scared to death about being found out. So I didn\u0027t wake Gene. And it has been a great comfort ever since to me to remember how peaceful he looked, because that shows he felt innocent in his mind and not with a guilty conscience to keep him awake like Lady Macbeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say anything more, because I have promised over and over again not to say a thing about the plan to save Gene, but I will just say this,--If you should happen to hear that I was married, will you please, please understand and believe that it was to help Gene, and that of course I must do anything for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yours faithfully\" (a blot made it look like \"tearfully\"), \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jean Benbow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was incoherent enough (except for the part about Gene, which I put aside in my mind to think out later,) but one thing seemed clear,--that she was married or about to be married, and that she had been lured into this madness by some delusion that in this way she was going to be able to help her brother. I glanced at the envelope. It had not been through the mails. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When and where did you get this, Barney?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yisterday, yer honor. She brought it to me herself. An\u0027 she wanted to bind me by great oaths out of a book that I wouldn\u0027t give it to you till afther to-day had gone by. Sez I, How can I give it to him till he comes here, an\u0027 his office man sez he won\u0027t be here for a week yet,--for I had been to find out on my own account,--God forgive me for deceivin\u0027 the innocent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t her letter, then, that made you telegraph, if you only got it yesterday. Was there anything else?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His eyes fell, and he shifted his weight on his crutch uneasily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw her cryin\u0027 and I knew she was carryin\u0027 sorrow,\" he said at last, defiantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When? Where? Tell me everything, can\u0027t you? Did you know anything of her plan to be married? Do you know where she is?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know only what I see,--an\u0027 that was that she was unhappy. It was this way. She came by my stand many a time, asking this about you and that about you, an\u0027 when would you be back, an\u0027 I cud see that there was more on her heart than a gurrul like her should be carryin\u0027. Then one night I saw her cryin\u0027,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twas in her own home, sure. Her head was down on the windy-sill, an\u0027 it was dark, and she never mistrusted there was anybody about the place watchin\u0027,--an\u0027 no more there was, seein\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t count an old codger like meself anybody. She was sobbin\u0027 and talkin\u0027 aloud to herself,--\" He broke off and looked at me with fierce reproach. \"I telegraphed for ye then, sor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I came at once. Then this letter,--she brought you this yesterday?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That was it. An\u0027 if you hadn\u0027t come by this train, sor, I would have opened it meself.\" He looked at me defiantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She says here--at least, I think she means to say, that she is going to be married,--and in mad foolishness. Wait till I see what I can learn by telephone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I got Mr. Ellison\u0027s house first. Mrs. Crosswell, who answered, was sure that Miss Benbow was not at home, but did not have any idea where she was. Did not know whether she had taken anything with her when she left the house or not. I then called up Mrs. Whyte, explained that a letter from Jean suggested a possible elopement, and begged her to go over and see if she could find out where Jean went, when she left the house, and whether she had taken any things that would indicate a contemplated permanent departure. I then took my head in my hands and thought, holding down the terror that surged up every other moment and almost made thinking impossible. \"If you hear that I am married,\" she had said. Was it Garney? Never mind. Garney or anyone else, people could not be married without certain preliminaries, without leaving certain records. There must have been a license. I took Barney with me in the cab, and we whirled up to the court house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you any record of issuing a marriage license for Jean Benbow within the last few days?\" I demanded of the clerk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Why has the Lord made so many stupid people? My question had to be handed on from one clerk to another and record after record after record examined,--and here every wasted minute was wearing away this \"day,\" this critical day, over which Jean had wished her secret to be kept. I held my watch in my hand while they searched. At last they found it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks like Jack put this memorandum where it wouldn\u0027t be found too easy,\" the successful searcher said significantly to his fuming superior. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was quite possible,--for the memorandum showed the issue of a license for the marriage of Allen King Garney and Jean Benbow, and it was dated the day before. She had stipulated with Barney that I should not receive her letter till after to-day, which meant that this was the day. And here it was drawing toward five o\u0027clock. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, out of the intense anxiety which fused all thought and feeling into one passionate will to save her, came the inspiration. She had said, on that drive when I took her and old William Jordan out into the country, that if ever she were married it would be there , in the vine-covered church of the old suburb where her mother had stood a bride. The recollection was almost like a voice,--\"Don\u0027t you remember?\" I did,--oh, I did! Every word, every look. My hand was shaking as I turned the pages of the city directory, trying to identify the church which I knew only by its location, and to discover the name of its minister. Then I turned again to the telephone. There was no connection with the church, but I succeeded at last in getting the minister\u0027s house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Mr. Arnold is not at home,\" a gentle feminine voice answered. \"He has gone to the church to perform a marriage ceremony.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you catch him?--stop him? Is it too late?\" I cried desperately over the wire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, the wedding was at four o\u0027clock,\" the shocked voice answered. \"Oh, is there anything wrong? I am sure Henry didn\u0027t know,--we thought it so romantic, a secret wedding,--\" I hung up the receiver regardless of her emotions and went back to my cab on the run, while the listening office force enjoyed the sensation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to the little church at the corner of Olympia and Hazel Streets,\" I said to the chauffeur, \"and get there as soon as you can without being arrested. Get there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then I told Barney what I had discovered. There was no reasonable ground for supposing that I would be in time to prevent disaster, yet I must go on, even against reason. And surely Providence would interfere to save her! I could so easily understand how she had been misled. Garney had made her believe that he could help Gene. Perhaps he had suggested that I was not giving the case proper attention. He had offered some impossible assistance if she would marry him, and she, with her romantic, schoolgirlish, unreal ideas of the way things were done in the world, had consented all the more readily because it involved a sacrifice on her part. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cab swung up to the curb, I jumped up the church steps, and pushed my way through the swinging baize doors. The room was dim, but I could see a group of three before the altar,--Garney, yes; and the minister; and Jean. They turned to look as I stormed down the aisle, and moved slightly apart. I caught Jean\u0027s hands in mine and looked into her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jean! Are you married?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A mist of tears dimmed the brightness of her eyes. \"Oh, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come,\" she said, quiveringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still holding her hands I turned to the minister. \"Have you married these two, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not yet. The young lady appears to have been detained,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I took the wrong car! I was just explaining,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment the room swam before my eyes. I was in time! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was just an accident,\" Jean was saying. \"Then when I found I was wrong, I came back as soon as possible and--now I am ready!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ready!\" I crushed her hands until she drew them away with a little gasp. I turned impatiently to Garney, who stood motionless, white-faced, watching her. Of course he knew the game was up, but he did not move. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go!\" I said. \"I\u0027ll settle with you later.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I don\u0027t know whether he heard me. His eyes were fixed upon Jean with mingled anger, longing, and despair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You waited till he should come! You left word for him to follow you!\" he said pantingly. \"In spite of your promises, you never meant to keep your word. You do not care about your brother. You thought you could trick me--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no, no!\" she cried, breaking from me and going to him with hands extended. \"I am here! I am ready. I will marry you now,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jean!\" I cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" she said, turning breathlessly to me. \"He is going to help us save Gene. He knows something,--he said he would tell me if we were married,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense. It was a trick. If Mr. Garney has any information that will benefit your brother,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He might hand it over to you, I suppose!\" Garney said with a sneer. \"Very well, I will. Investigate that ex-convict that you keep in your office. You may find something that will be of interest. But if you hadn\u0027t come--\" He moistened his dry lips, then turned abruptly and walked up the aisle. I saw that he tried to hurry, but he walked unsteadily and steadied himself by the pews. I once saw a gambler who had staked everything on a desperate game, and lost, stagger like that from the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did he mean about an ex-convict?\" Jean asked in a shocked voice. \"Not Mr. Fellows? And what would he have to do with it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I said promptly, putting certain uncomfortable recollections out of my mind. \"Don\u0027t you see that Mr. Garney was merely deceiving you? He had nothing to tell, no help to give you. He merely wanted to marry you. Jean, Jean! How could you do so mad a thing?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For Gene!\" she said reproachfully. \"Why, I\u0027d do anything. And Mr. Garney said he surely would tell me when we were married, and if I cared for Gene I would do it. He wouldn\u0027t tell me beforehand, because he--he doesn\u0027t like you!\" She dropped her eyes in delicious confusion. \"You see, he is--jealous of you! He didn\u0027t want me to wear this!\" She touched the locket she wore on a chain about her neck,--the locket I had given her just before leaving Saintsbury. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did he know I had given you the locket?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He just guessed.\" She looked shy and conscious--and charming. But something puzzled me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell him? You are sure of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" she said, looking surprised. \"I never told anybody. Not anybody at all. It was a kind of a--secret.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How do ideas come to us? I thought I was wholly absorbed in Jean, and was conscious merely of a desire to soothe and calm her by taking things naturally, but now something seemed to nudge my attention and to urge, \"Don\u0027t you see what that means? Don\u0027t you see? Don\u0027t you see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I did see--in a flash. That locket! It had not been out of my locked desk until I gave it to Jean, except once,--the night of Barker\u0027s murder. I had taken it to Mrs. Whyte\u0027s that evening, and had shown the portrait to Miss Thurston for a minute. I was sure she had not even seen the outside of the case, which was out of my hand but a moment. But later that evening, while I sat in Barker\u0027s office waiting, I had taken the locket from my pocket and had sat under the gaslight examining it--in full view of the concealed murderer who had watched me from the dark inner room, and who, a few minutes later, shot Barker from that same concealment. The whole thing flashed before my mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait here,\" I said, and dashed for the door by which Garney had left. He was a block away, evidently waiting for a street car which I could see approaching. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take me down to that car,\" I said to the chauffeur, and we were off at the word. Barney was still in the cab. \"You go back with the cab, Barney, and take Miss Benbow home. I must see Garney before he gets away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We reached the street just as the car, which had halted to take on Garney, started up again. I sprang from the step of the cab to the rear platform of the car. Garney turned and looked at me with surprise that changed quickly to anger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you following me?\" he demanded under his breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I told you we should have to have a settlement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Settle what? You\u0027ve won,\" he said, with a shrug. He went inside, while I remained on the platform, thinking out a plan of action. When the conductor came for my fare I said a few words to him. He looked amazed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When we pass a policeman, slow up a bit,\" I continued. \"If the man tries to get off before we pick up an officer, help me stop him. That\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We swung around a corner, saw a policeman standing outside the curb,--and the car stopped without signal. I jumped off and explained the situation to him in a word. He at once boarded the waiting car with me and approached the unconscious Garney. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re wanted,\" he said quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Garney rose, furious but also frightened. He looked at me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What damn foolishness is this?\" he said, trying to bluster. \"I haven\u0027t time for any nonsense. I have to catch a train. I\u0027m going away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, and don\u0027t make a disturbance,\" the officer said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I tell you it is a mistake. You\u0027ll suffer for it. It is not a criminal offense to try to get married.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps not,\" I said, taking the word from the police officer without warrant. \"You are under arrest because I charge you with the murder of Alfred Barker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I never saw a man faint before. He crumpled up like a collapsed balloon. We lifted him to the sidewalk so that the car could go on, and the patrolman called up the wagon. But before Garney came back to consciousness, I had lifted the moustached lip that masked his narrow jaw. The crowded teeth were pushed out on each side to form a V, exactly like the model made from the apple bitten in Barker\u0027s office. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2044/58300.html","bookId":608,"book":{"id":608,"title":"The Saintsbury Affair","description":"简介： Let me see where the story begins.
