{"id":26315,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII THE SAMOVAR EXPLODES","content":"The Saintsbury papers were thrown on our train several stations beyond the town. I bought one, of course, and unfolded it with a cheerful feeling of being near home again,--and there stared at me from the first page the glaring headlines,-- CLYDE A CRIMINAL THE REFORM CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE AMAZING RECORD OF CRIME AND CONCEALMENT DISCOVERED BY THE SAMOVAR I tore my way through the leaded paragraphs. The only thing that was news to me was the clue on which the Samovar had worked. According to the high-flown account, Barker had left at the Samovar office, on the night on which he was killed, a large sealed envelope addressed to himself, with the added direction: \"If this is not called for within five days, it is to be opened by the Managing Editor of the Samovar.\" It would appear that this was the errand that was occupying Barker while I sat waiting for him in his office! I could not refrain from pausing to admire the rascal\u0027s cleverness. He was anticipating--not the death which came so swiftly, but--a visit from Clyde, or possibly Clyde\u0027s representative, and he had adroitly made it impossible for Clyde to control the situation by force or coercion. The story was written out and in the hands of the paper which would most gladly profit by the disclosure, though it was still, for five days, subject to Barker\u0027s own recall, if he were properly treated! It certainly was a reserve of the most unquestionable value in diplomatic negotiations. The Samovar went on to say that after the sensation of Barker\u0027s death, the envelope had been held inviolate for the specified time, and had then been opened by Burleigh in the presence of witnesses. The story as written by Barker was then set forth in full. It recited briefly that Barker had been present at a court trial in Houston, Texas, some fifteen years before, at which one Tom Johnson had been convicted of the murder of a man named Henley, and sentenced to death. The prisoner had escaped from the sheriff immediately after conviction, and had never been captured. Then Mr. Barker proceeded: \"Two or three years ago I saw Mr. Kenneth Clyde in Saintsbury, and greatly to my surprise, I recognized in him the missing Tom Johnson. I charged him with the identity, and he did not deny it. He then and afterwards freely admitted to me that he was the man who, under another name, had been convicted of murder and had made his escape. I have refrained from making this information public out of consideration for Mr. Clyde, but I feel it a public duty to leave this record where, if certain contingencies should arise, it may be found.\" (The contingency which the writer had in mind was probably a refusal on the part of Clyde to continue paying blackmail. That would undoubtedly have made Mr. Barker\u0027s public duty weigh upon his tender conscience.) The Samovar then went on to say that the story at first seemed incredible, and therefore the witnesses were all sworn to secrecy until the matter could be investigated. A special representative had been sent to Texas to look it up. The writer then modestly emphasized the difficulties of the undertaking, and his own astonishing cleverness in mastering them. He had actually found the court records to establish the tale of the late lamented Mr. Barker, whose untimely taking off with this public service still unperformed would have been nothing less (under the present political circumstances) than a civic calamity. Tom Johnson had been convicted of the treacherous and bloody murder of his friend. (The details were then given in substantial agreement with the story which Clyde had told me.) \"But who,\" the happy historian went on to say, \"who would have guessed, who would have dared suggest, who would have ventured to believe, that this obscure criminal, snatching the stolen cloak of freedom from the heedless hands of careless officials, and skulking off with it by the underground passages known to the criminal classes,--who would have believed that this false friend, this wretch, this felon, was none other than the Reform Candidate for Mayor of Saintsbury? The charge is so incredible that we may well be asked,--Where lies the proof of identity, beyond the word of Alfred Barker, now cold in death? The man who so long had successfully covered up his past, may well have felt, when Barker met his tragic fate, that at last he could walk in security, since the one witness who, in a period of fifteen years, had identified him, was now disposed of. But murder will out. The truth, though crushed to earth, will live again. The sun in the heavens has been summoned as a witness. While Tom Johnson was in jail, awaiting trial, an enterprising paper of the place secured several photographs of the prisoner. These our representative found in an old file of the paper. We reproduce below, side by side, the photographs of Tom Johnson, lying under an unexecuted sentence for murder, and of Kenneth Clyde, reform candidate for mayor. They speak for themselves.\" They did, indeed. It was like a blow in the face to see the pictures side by side, even in the coarse newspaper print. The handsome, defiant face of the younger man had been softened and refined and had grown thoughtful,--but it was the same face. If Clyde had wanted to deny the accusation (though I knew that he would not think for a moment of that course,) it would have been fruitless. The photographs made it impossible. As I studied them, I thought that any woman who loved him,--his mother or another,--should certainly be ready to give thanks on her knees for the changes that the fifteen years had wrought. As a young fellow he had clearly been rather too handsome. That any man with so much of the \"beauty of the devil\" had been marked by the stars for a tumultuous career was most obvious. There was spiritual tragedy in every lineament. On the other hand, there was no deviltry in the seriously handsome face of the man of to-day. You did not even think first of his good looks, the deeper significance of character had so come to the surface. Certainly, the shadow under which Clyde had lived had fostered the best in him. The newspaper scribe ended his paragraph with a cruel innuendo: \"The sudden death of Alfred Barker at a time when Clyde had most to fear from the secret in his knowledge would have had a sinister appearance, if that apparent mystery had not been promptly solved by the confession of Eugene Benbow. Clyde should acknowledge his indebtedness to the convenient Benbow.\" The fact that I had had a bad quarter of an hour convincing myself that Clyde had had nothing to do with the matter did not make me less indignant with the astute newspaper scribbler. And I saw further complications in the subject. If I cleared Gene--as I fully meant to do--it would be necessary to do it by bringing the real murderer to light. To clear Gene by simply proving that he was not on the spot (assuming that to be possible) would be merely to transfer the shadow of doubt to Clyde. It was a bad tangle. The moment I reached the Saintsbury station, I tried to get into communication with Clyde. He might not care to have me act as his legal adviser in this more serious development of his case, but at least I must give him the opportunity to decline. It was eight o\u0027clock when the train pulled in, and I went at once to the private telephone booth and tried to get Clyde. His office was closed and did not answer,--I had expected that. His residence telephone likewise \"didn\u0027t answer.\" Then I called up the chief of police, and asked whether Clyde had been arrested, basing my inquiry on the Samovar story. He had not,--though it took me some time to get that statement out of the close-mouthed officials of the law. Then I called up Mr. Whyte\u0027s residence, hoping to get some hint of the situation as it affected my friends. It was Jean Benbow\u0027s voice that answered my call. \"Oh, it\u0027s you!\" she cried, and the intonation of her voice was the most flattering thing I have ever heard in my life--almost. \"Oh, I always did know that there must be special providences for special occasions, and if anybody ever thinks there aren\u0027t, I\u0027ll tell them about your calling up at just this moment, and they\u0027ll know. The most dreadful thing has happened,--\" \"I have seen the Evening Samovar. Is that what you mean?\" \"Oh, yes! Mrs. Whyte is at my elbow and she says I must tell you to come right up here in a jiffy--only she didn\u0027t say jiffy, but that is what she meant. She says now that I must not stand here and keep you talking, though really I know it is I that is talking,--or should I say am talking? But you understand. And Mrs. Whyte says you must jump into a cab and come up at once. Mr. Whyte wants to consult with you.\" The communication stopped with an abruptness that suggested external assistance. It was Jean herself who admitted me. She must have been watching out for me, for she had the door open and was half way down the steps to meet me before I was fairly on Mr. Whyte\u0027s cement walk. \"Oh, but I am thankful to see you,\" she said earnestly. \"Ever since that paper came this afternoon, I have been in a dream! I mean an awful dream, you know,--almost a nightmare. It seemed so unreal. Though I suppose that is what real life is like, maybe?\" She looked at me inquiringly. \"I never saw anything like it before, and I have lived a real life for many more years than you have,\" I answered, meaning to reassure her. She looked at me under her lashes. \"Oh, not so very many more! Not enough to--to make any real difference. But you don\u0027t know how queer it seems to me to have things happening like this all around you. First Gene, and now Mr. Clyde. Do you believe it is true, Mr. Hilton?\" \"I can\u0027t form an opinion from newspaper tales alone,\" I said evasively. By this time we were at the door, where Mrs. Whyte was waiting, with Mr. Whyte at her shoulder. They both looked worried. \"You have seen the paper?\" Whyte asked, while we were shaking hands. \"Yes. On the train. Do you know where Clyde is?\" \"No. I tried to get him by \u0027phone, but I couldn\u0027t find him, and he knows where to find me, if he wants to. What do you think of it?\" I could only repeat that I could not express an opinion without more reliable information,--blessed subterfuge of the lawyer! Mrs. Whyte broke in emphatically. \"Well, I for one do not believe it. You needn\u0027t look so wise, Carroll, as though you meant to imply that we can\u0027t be sure of anyone until he is dead. I knew Kenneth Clyde when he wore knickerbockers and I knew his father and his uncle, and I simply don\u0027t believe it. The Samovar is nothing but a political scandal-monger, anyway.\" \"It was a long time ago, Clara,\" Whyte said deprecatingly. \"Clyde was young, and you know he was a wild youngster. And there may have been provocations of which we know nothing.\" \"You are trying to excuse him, as though you thought the story true,\" cried Mrs. Whyte indignantly. \"I simply say that I don\u0027t believe it. Not for a moment.\" \"I believe it,\" said a voice that startled us all. Katherine Thurston was standing on the landing of the stairs, looking down upon us as we were grouped in the hall. There was a tall lamp on the newel which threw a white light on her face, but it was not the lamp-light which gave it the look of subdued radiance that held our gaze. I confess I stared quite greedily, careless of what she was saying. But Mrs. Whyte recovered herself first,--naturally. \"Katherine! What are you saying? Come down!\" She came down slowly. There was a curious stillness upon her, as though she had come strangely upon peace in the midst of a storm. p186 \"I believe it,\" said a voice that startled us all. Page 186. \"I should think you would at least wait for a little better evidence before believing such a thing of--of any friend!\" Mrs. Whyte chided indignantly. Something like a ripple passed over Miss Thurston\u0027s face. She was actually smiling! \"I don\u0027t mean that I am eager to believe evil reports of Mr. Clyde,\" she said gently. \"But--it explains so much. I think it probably is true because it would--explain. And, of course,\" she added, lifting her head with a proud gesture that would have sent Clyde to his knees, \"of course it makes not an atom of difference in our feeling toward him. We know what he is.\" Man is a curious animal. I was not in love with Katherine Thurston. I had never come within hailing distance of her heart and would have been somewhat afraid of it if I had; I had even suspected that the artificial calm which lay between her and Clyde covered emotional possibilities, past, present, or to come; and yet, now that I saw the whole tale written on her unabashed face, I felt suddenly as though a rich and coveted galleon were sailing away, forever out of my reach! It was probably only a bare moment that we were all held there silent, but the moment was so tense that its revelations were not to be counted by time. Then Jean, who stood beside me, suddenly clasped my arm with both her hands, in a gesture that I felt to be a warning. I looked down at her inquiringly. She nodded slightly toward the French window which opened from the library upon a side porch, and following her gesture I saw the shadow of a stooping man outside. Before I could reach the window, it was pushed open from without, and Kenneth Clyde stepped into the room. I don\u0027t think we were surprised,--we had reached a state of mind where the unexpected seemed natural,--but when Clyde stepped instantly aside from the window and stood in the shadow of the bookcase, we awoke to a realization of what his coming meant. \"I beg your pardon for entering in this unceremonious way,\" he said (and there was a thrill of excitement in his voice that went through us all like a laughing challenge) \"but I have been dodging the police for an hour, and I know I am followed now. If you would draw the curtain, Hilton,--\" I drew the curtains over the windows, and Whyte closed the door into the hall. I think he locked it. The three women had followed us into the library, and though they stood silent and breathless, I do not think that Clyde could have had much doubt in his mind as to whether he held their sympathy. \"I had to come for just a moment before I got out of town,\" he said in a hurried undertone. He spoke to the room, but his eyes were on Katherine Thurston, who stood silent at a little distance. \"Tut, tut, man, you mustn\u0027t leave town,\" cried Whyte. \"The worst thing you could possibly do! Ask Hilton here. He\u0027s a lawyer.\" Clyde smiled at me, but went on rapidly. \"I am not asking advice of counsel on this,--I am acting on my own responsibility. I cannot take the risk of giving myself up to the authorities. I know what that means. I am going away,--there is nothing else to do. But I could not go without coming here for a moment. You--my friends--have a right to ask an account of me.\" He paused for a second in his rapid speech, and then went on with a deeper ring in his voice. \"The newspaper story is true, so far as my conviction by a Texas court fifteen years ago goes. But I was convicted through a mistake. I am innocent of murder. But I could not prove it. That--\" He laughed somewhat unsteadily, and his eyes held Miss Thurston\u0027s,--\"that is the story of my life.\" We had none of us moved while he spoke, partly because he was so still himself, partly from a feeling of overshadowing danger which might descend if we stirred. But now Katherine Thurston moved toward him and he took a step to meet her. I think they had both forgotten all the rest of the world. \"Couldn\u0027t you have trusted me?\" she asked, in tenderest reproach. \"I couldn\u0027t trust myself,\" he answered in a low voice. \"Ah, there you were wrong!\" she said quickly. \"So many years! And now--\" \"Now I must go and see if there is any way to gather up the broken fragments.\" \"Could I not help in some way? May I not go with you?\" she asked simply. \"You would do that?\" he demanded. \"Anywhere,\" she answered. He lifted her fingers to his lips and hid their trembling upon her white hand. \"No, you cannot go,\" he said, with a break in his voice. \"Then I will wait for you here,\" she said. \"Oh, my God!\" he breathed. We came to our senses then, and Mrs. Whyte swept us out into the hall with one wave of her matronly arm. They must have that moment of complete understanding to themselves. We hovered at the foot of the stairs, waiting to speak again with Clyde, yet too upset in our minds to have any clear idea of what we could suggest or needed to ask. Mrs. Whyte, in a surge of emotion, caught Jean to her buxom bosom,--against which the child looked like a star-flower on a brocaded silk hillock. Jean\u0027s eyes were shining,--and not her eyes alone; her whole face was alight with a tender radiance. Whyte gripped my shoulder to turn my attention. \"See here, Hilton, he mustn\u0027t run away. It would look like guilt. You must tell him, as a lawyer, that it would be the worst thing he could do. If he is innocent, the law will protect him,--\" \"The law has already condemned him,\" I reminded him. \"The situation is difficult. He is not a man merely accused, his defense unpresented. He has been tried, convicted, and sentenced.\" \"Good heavens!\" he gasped. \"Then if he puts himself in the hands of the law, there will be nothing left but to see the execution of the sentence? Is that what you mean?\" \"Yes. That is the situation. There have been cases where men who had escaped from prison have lived for years exemplary lives and reached civic honors, yet, when recognized and apprehended, they had to go back to prison and serve out the unexpired sentence of the man condemned years before.\" \"But if the sentence was unwarranted?\" \"Of course we would try to make a fight on it,\" I said, but without much confidence. \"But the sentence was pronounced by a duly qualified court, and it will not be easy to upset it at this late day. It would be a thousand times harder now to find any evidence there may be in his favor than it could have been then, when the events were fresh in the memory of everybody. And unless we can discover some new evidence having a bearing on the matter, we would have no ground on which to ask for a re-opening of the case.\" \"That\u0027s terrible,\" he said. Then, dropping his voice, \"Is the death penalty in force there?\" I nodded. \"The man was a fool to hang around home,\" Whyte protested energetically, as he took the situation in. \"Why didn\u0027t he have sense enough to go to South America or Africa, or the South Sea Islands when he first escaped?\" As if in answer to his question, the library door opened, and Katherine Thurston stood framed in the doorway. She had the same curiously still air that I had noticed when she stood on the stairs,--as though her spirit had found the way into a region of mysterious peace. \"He has gone,\" she said quietly. There was a sudden tap at the front door, and then, without further warning or delay, it was opened, and a police officer stood there. \"Is Mr. Clyde in the house?\" he asked directly. \"No,\" Whyte answered. The officer glanced about the room with a swift survey of us all. \"He\u0027s gone, then?\" he said. No one answered. \"Sorry to have troubled you,\" he said, touching his helmet, and immediately went out. We heard low voices and hurried steps passing around the house. \"Oh, they\u0027ll find him!\" cried Mrs. Whyte in dismay. \"He can\u0027t have got a safe distance yet.\" \"Hush!\" warned Whyte. He stepped to the library and looked out. Then after a moment he came back to us. \"They are watching the house. The longer they watch, the better! Do you know his plans, Hilton?\" I shook my head. Miss Thurston had faded away like a wraith but Mrs. Whyte and Jean were hanging on our words. \"No, I have no idea where he is going, or what he means to do. The police are very close on his heels. I confess it looks dubious that he will get very far.\" Jean laughed out suddenly and clapped her hands together. \"Why, of course he will escape! After they have come to know about each other!\" she exclaimed. \"Nothing else would be possible, now!\" Whyte and I exchanged glances. As a matter of fact, we would all like to live in a rose-colored world, where things would happen of necessity as they do in properly constructed fairy tales, but it takes the confidence of a Jean to announce such faith in the face of unsympathetic Experience.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2044/58295.html","bookId":608,"book":{"id":608,"title":"The Saintsbury Affair","description":"简介： Let me see where the story begins.
