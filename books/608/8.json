{"id":26310,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII SOME OF JEAN\u0027S WAYS","content":"I have noticed that ideas usually come to me at the moment of awaking. The next morning I came back to a consciousness of Gene Benbow\u0027s affairs with a perplexity which was momentarily illuminated by the thought, \"Why don\u0027t I look up Barker\u0027s home? He must have been staying somewhere, and the people there may know something about him.\" \n \n Why hadn\u0027t I thought of that before? However, yesterday had been a pretty busy day as it was. I turned at once to the city directory, and then to the telephone directory. There was no indication in either that such a person as Alfred Barker lived in Saintsbury. The Western Land and Improvement Co. appeared in the telephone directory, but that of course was no help. I called up the police department and asked if they could tell me where Barker had lived. Yes, they had investigated,--26 Angus Avenue, was the number. \n \n \"And, by the way,\" my informant added, \"Barker\u0027s body has been claimed.\" \n \n \"By whom?\" I demanded. \n \n \"Collier, the undertaker. He says that a woman came to his place last night and gave him directions and money, but would not give her name. She was veiled, and he knows nothing about her, except that she paid him to see that the body was decently interred.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s all you know?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s all anybody knows.\" \n \n \"Collier is in charge, then?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n That was interesting, so far as it went. Was the woman who had provided for Barker\u0027s burial merely some benevolent stranger who had been emotionally stirred by the newspaper accounts, (that sort of thing happens more frequently than you would believe,) or was there some closer bond? The answer seemed as hidden as everything else connected with this strange affair. \n \n On my way to my office, I hunted up 26 Angus Avenue. It was such a place as I might have expected,--a shabby house in a row, on a semi-obscure street. My ring was answered by a young woman of about twenty,--an unkempt, heavy-eyed young woman, who didn\u0027t look happy. She listened unresponsively while I preferred my request for some information about Mr. Barker, and left me standing in the hall while she returned to some dark back room. I heard her say, \"Ma! Here\u0027s another wants to know things.\" And presently Ma appeared, hot from the kitchen, and somewhat fretted. \n \n \"I can\u0027t be answering questions all day,\" she said, at me rather than to me. \"There was a string of people here all day yesterday, taking my time. Just because Mr. Barker roomed here is no reason why I should know all about him.\" \n \n \"You probably know more than any of the rest of us,\" I said, deferentially. \"Had Mr. Barker been long with you?\" \n \n \"Long enough, but that don\u0027t mean that I know much about him. He was here awhile in the summer two years ago, and when he was in town afterwards he would come here to see if I could give him a room. But he never stayed long at a time. I think he was some kind of a traveling man,--here to-day and gone to-morrow. He has been here now for the last six weeks, but he never had any visitors or received any letters and I don\u0027t know the names and addresses of any of his relatives,--and that\u0027s what I told the police and all the rest of them!\" She finished breathless but still defiant. \n \n \"That seems to cover the ground pretty thoroughly,\" I laughed. \"But I shall have to ask another question on my own account. Was he married?\" \n \n \"No!\" said the girl positively. I had not noticed that she had returned. She was standing in the doorway behind me. \n \n \"Not that we know,\" said the mother, more guardedly, and with an anxious look at her daughter. \n \n \"Did he leave any effects here?\" \n \n \"You can see the room, like all the rest,\" she said, with grim impartiality. \n \n \"I\u0027d like to.\" \n \n She led the way up a narrow stairway from the front hall to a rear room on the second floor. She opened the door with a key which she took from her pocket, and stepped inside. \n \n \"Land sakes!\" she exclaimed. \n \n The reason was clear. The room was all upset. The contents of a trunk, which stood in one corner, were scattered upon the floor, the drawers of the bureau were open, and a writing desk near the window had evidently been thoroughly searched. Every drawer was open, and papers were scattered upon the floor. \n \n \"Land sakes!\" she repeated. \"Gertie, come here.\" \n \n Gertie came, and swept the room with the unsurprised and comprehending eye of the practical young woman of to-day. \n \n \"Someone got in through the window,\" she said briefly. \"You know that clasp doesn\u0027t catch, Anybody could get in. Well, I hope they are satisfied now!\" From her tone I understood that she hoped just the opposite. \n \n \"We might all have been murdered in our beds!\" exclaimed the mother. \n \n \"Oh, it wasn\u0027t us they were after,\" said Gertie carelessly. \"It was him! I tell you,--\" She stopped suddenly and bit her lip. \n \n \"But who could ever have known that the catch didn\u0027t work?\" demanded the mother in a baffled manner. \n \n \"To whom did you show the room yesterday?\" I asked. \"Anyone who had an opportunity to examine the room inside could have made plans for returning at night.\" \n \n \"Well, first it was the police, and they told me not to let anyone touch anything,--though I knew that myself. Then there were people all day long,--curiosity seekers, I call them. There was one little old gentleman that came up first,--I say old, but he was as spry as any of them. Something like a bird in the way he turned his head.\" \n \n It suggested Mr. Ellison exactly! \"With spectacles?\" I asked. \n \n \"Yes. Gold-brimmed. Gray hair that curled up at the ends.\" \n \n \"Anyone else you remember? Was there a tall young man, fresh-shaven, with rather a blue-black tint where the beard had been taken off?\" \n \n \"There was!\" cried Gertie. \"I saw that! He came last night, about seven.\" \n \n \"Well, I didn\u0027t let him go up,\" said the mother. \"I was tired bothering with them.\" \n \n \"But you told him which room Mr. Barker had,\" said Gertie. \n \n \"Who was he?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know. I saw such a looking man with Mr. Barker the other day, and I just asked out of curiosity.\" \n \n \"I will have to report this to the police,\" said the woman wearily. \"No end of trouble. If you please, sir, I\u0027ll lock the door now.\" \n \n \"One moment!\" I had been standing beside the writing desk, and my eye had caught a few words written on a sheet of letter paper,--the beginning of an unfinished letter. \"Is this Mr. Barker\u0027s writing, do you know?\" \n \n The letter read: \n \n \"My Dear Wife:--So I have found my little runaway! Did she think that she could hide away from her hubby? Don\u0027t fool yourself, little one!\" \n \n Gertie had snatched the paper from my hand and read it with startled eyes. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said, violently. \"That--is not his writing!\" She flung the paper down, and left the room. \n \n \"What is it?\" asked her mother, fretfully. \n \n \"An unfinished letter to his wife,--if it is his.\" \n \n \"We never knew much about him,\" she said, looking troubled. I could easily guess a part of the story that troubled her. \n \n I had no excuse for further lingering, so I left Mrs. Barrows (she asked my name and gave me her own at parting) and went down to my office. Fellows was waiting for me, and it struck me at once that his manner was weighted with unusual significance. \n \n \"Well?\" I asked. He always waited, like a dog, for a sign. \n \n \"Barker was married,\" he said. \"He married a Mary Doherty up in Claremont four years ago, when he was forty. She was twenty.\" \n \n \"Is that all you have found out?\" \n \n \"All so far.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s good, so far as it goes, but I can add to it. She ran away from him, is probably now in Saintsbury, and the chances are that it was she who empowered Collier the undertaker to arrange for his burial. Advertise in the papers for Mary Doherty, and say that she will learn of something to her advantage by communicating with me. I\u0027ll make it to her advantage! Keep the advertisement going until I tell you to stop. That\u0027s all.\" \n \n Fellows went off and I knew the matter would be attended to faithfully and with intelligence. But several times during the day I noticed that he was unlike himself. He was absent-minded and he looked unmistakably worried. It frets me to have people about me who are obviously burdened with secret sorrows they will ne\u0027er impart, and I finally spoke. \n \n \"What in thunder is the matter with you today, Fellows? What\u0027s on your mind?\" \n \n \"Nothing,\" he said quickly. But after a minute or so he looked up with that same disturbed air. \"Who would have thought that he had a wife?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s not especially astonishing.\" \n \n \"I never thought that there could be a woman--a woman who could care for him, I mean.\" \n \n \"She probably didn\u0027t. She ran away.\" \n \n \"Still it must have been a terrible shock. And if she cared about burying him,--\" \n \n \"You\u0027re too tender-hearted, Fellows,\" I said. But I confess that I liked his betrayal of sympathy. He was too unemotional as a rule. \n \n Well, that brings me down to my interview with Garney, which took place that afternoon. \n \n Mr. Garney was one of the regular faculty at Vandeventer College, and to meet his convenience I asked him to fix the time and place for the interview which I desired. He said he would come to my office at four, and he kept his appointment promptly. I had told Jean Benbow that if she could come to my office at half past four, I would take her down to see her brother. She came fifteen minutes ahead of time,--and that\u0027s how she came into the story. Into that part of the story, I mean. But I had all that Garney could probably tell me before she came in and disconcerted him. I think my first question surprised him. \n \n \"Mr. Garney, do you know anything to Eugene Benbow\u0027s discredit?\" \n \n He looked at me with an intentness that I found was habitual with him, as though he weighed my words before he answered them. \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean trivial faults?\" \n \n \"No. I mean anything serious.\" \n \n He shook his head. \"No. He is an exceptionally fine fellow in every way. High-spirited and honorable. I suppose his sensitiveness to his family honor, as he conceives it, may be called a fault, since it has unbalanced him to the extent of leading him into a crime.\" \n \n \"You know of no absorbing entanglement, either with man or woman?\" \n \n \"No,\" he said, evidently puzzled by my question. \n \n \"Have you ever heard him express vengefulness toward Barker?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes,\" he said, decidedly. \"I know that he has brooded over that. He does not talk of it in general, I believe, but he has been a special pupil of mine, and he has taken me somewhat into his confidence. That Barker should have escaped all punishment for the slaying of his father has worn upon him. He spoke of it only once, but then he expressed himself in such a way that I knew he had been carrying it in his mind a long time.\" \n \n \"Then you believe that he really shot Barker?\" \n \n He stared at me, amazed. \"Of course.\" \n \n \"You think of nothing that would prompt him to assert his guilt, if, in point of fact, he should not be guilty?\" \n \n I never saw a man look more astonished. \"If you really mean that, I can only say that I can think of nothing short of insanity which would make him say he shot Barker if he didn\u0027t. Why, he has confessed. Do you mean to say that you think the confession false? And if so, why?\" \n \n \"I am not thinking yet. I am merely gathering facts of all sorts. When I get them all together, I expect to discover the truth, whatever it may be.\" \n \n \"I supposed his confession was conclusive. But I suppose you lawyers get to looking at everything with suspicion. Have you anything to support your extraordinary hypothesis beyond your natural desire to clear your client?\" \n \n I had no intention of taking him extensively into my confidence, but I was saved the necessity of answering at all by the opening of my office door. Jean Benbow put her head in, with a shy, childlike dignity. \n \n \"Am I too early?\" she whispered. \"I couldn\u0027t wait.\" \n \n \"Come in,\" I smiled. \n \n She came in, glanced carelessly at my visitor, and walked over to my window. She was dressed in an autumnal brown, with a trim little hat that somehow made her look more mature and less childish than she had seemed before, though still more like a frank brown-faced boy than a young lady. I saw that Carney\u0027s eyes followed her to the window with a look of startled attention. \n \n \"I think that is all I wanted to ask you at this time,\" I said, meaning to imply that the interview was ended. \n \n \"Yes,\" he said, irrelevantly, without taking his eyes from Jean. \n \n I rose. \"I may come to you again, Mr. Garney,--\" \n \n At the name, Jean turned swiftly and came to us. \n \n \"Oh, are you Mr. Garney?\" she asked eagerly, putting out her hand. \"I\u0027m so glad to meet you. Gene has told me about you. I\u0027m Gene\u0027s twin sister, Jean.\" \n \n He looked like a man in a dream, and I could see that his voice had caught in his throat. He took her hand and held it, looking down at her. \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know that Gene had a sister,\" he said at last. \n \n \"If that isn\u0027t like a boy!\" she said with quick indignation. \"At any rate, he has told me about you!\" \n \n \"Nothing bad, I hope?\" He smiled faintly, but I felt that he was almost breathlessly waiting for her reassurance. \n \n \"Mercy, no! He thinks you know an awful lot.\" Then she drew back a step, threw up her head to look him steadily in the eye, and said clearly, \"Mr. Garney, I think Gene did exactly right. And I am proud of him.\" \n \n I saw that she meant to permit no misunderstanding as to her position but I doubted whether Garney cared a rap what she might think. It wasn\u0027t her opinions that he cared about. It was herself. I admit that it annoyed me. I wanted to get her out of his sight. \n \n \"It is time for us to go, Miss Benbow,\" I said abruptly. \n \n \"You are going down to the jail?\" asked Garney quickly. I saw that it was on the tip of his tongue to propose going with us. \n \n \"Yes, we are going,\" I said, looking at him steadily. \"You, I believe, are going back to your classroom.\" \n \n An angry look came over his face as he caught my meaning. I saw that he would not forget it, but I didn\u0027t care. Was I to stand by and say nothing while he tumbled his wits at her feet? It was absurd. She wasn\u0027t old enough to understand and defend herself. We parted definitely at the street door, and I walked Jean so fast down the block that I was ashamed when I suddenly realized what I was doing. \n \n \"I beg your pardon,\" I said, slowing up. \n \n She had kept up manfully, though breathlessly. \"Oh, I like to walk fast,\" she said staunchly. \n \n \"Did you see your brother yesterday?\" \n \n \"Yes. But only for a minute. And there was a horrid man who kept hanging around in a most ill-bred manner, so that I really couldn\u0027t talk to Gene comfortably. I believe he did it on purpose!\" \n \n \"It is quite possible,\" I admitted. \n \n She looked at me sideways under her long lashes. \"Your voice sounds as though you were laughing at me inside.\" \n \n \"Let me laugh with you, instead,\" I said hastily. \"The man was there on purpose. Prisoners are not allowed to see visitors alone, speaking generally.\" \n \n She was thoughtful for a few moments. \"Then how are we going to arrange to get him out?\" \n \n \"I thought you were going to leave that to me.\" \n \n \"Not leave it to you,\" she said gently. \"Of course I am glad to have you help, because there are lots of times when a man is very useful. But Gene is my brother, you know.\" \n \n \"Yes, of course,\" I said, trying to catch her thought. \n \n \"So of course I am going to be in it. All the time.\" \n \n \"In what, child?\" \n \n \"In the plans for his escape.\" She set her face into lines of determination which I saw was intended to overwhelm any vain opposition that I might raise to her plan. \n \n \"A lawyer doesn\u0027t usually take that method of getting a man out of prison,\" I said apologetically. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of it.\" \n \n \"But isn\u0027t it the best way?\" she said urgently. \"Of course I don\u0027t know as much about the law as you do,--of course not,--but doesn\u0027t the law just have to do something to a man when he shoots another man,--even if he is perfectly right to do it?\" \n \n It was an appalling question. I could not answer. She did not need anything more than my face, apparently, for she went on quickly. \n \n \"So that\u0027s why I thought it would be quicker and better, and would settle things once for all and be done with it,\" she explained. \"Now, there are lots of ways we can help him to escape. You know we are twins.\" \n \n \"Yes. What of that?\" \n \n She hesitated a moment. \"Isn\u0027t there any way I could get into Gene\u0027s room for a minute without having that horrid man watching?\" \n \n \"Perhaps. What then?\" \n \n \"We could change clothes. I\u0027d wear a rain coat that came down to the ground and a wide hat with a heavy veil, and extra high heels on my shoes. And you\u0027d be there to distract the attention of the horrid man,--that would be your part, and it\u0027s a very difficult and important part, too. Then Gene would just walk down the corridor,--I\u0027d have to remind him to take little steps and not to hurry too much,--and then after awhile they would come and look into the cell to see if he was all safe and they\u0027d see me. And I\u0027d just say \u0027Good day\u0027 politely, and walk off.\" She looked at me eagerly, waiting for my criticism. \n \n I looked as sympathetic as possible. \"It\u0027s a very pretty plan, Miss Jean, but your brother is quite a bit taller than you are, isn\u0027t he? I\u0027m afraid that might be noticed.\" \n \n She looked crestfallen, but only for a moment. \"Then I don\u0027t see but what we shall have to get him out through the window,\" she said. \n \n \"I have read of such things,\" I granted her. \n \n \"Oh, yes, I have read quantities of stories where prisoners were helped to escape,\" she said eagerly. \"It always can be done,--one way if not another. Last night I was trying to think it out, and I had six plans all thought out. What\u0027s the use of being twins, if it doesn\u0027t count for something?\" \n \n \"I am sure it counts for a great deal, Miss Jean, even if--\" \n \n \"But I shall be able to,\" she cried, cutting across my unspoken words. \"I must. Of course when I am talking to Gene I am as cheerful as possible, and I don\u0027t let him see that I--I\u0027m a bit afraid, but truly, you know, I--I--I don\u0027t like it.\" Her lips were quivering. \n \n \"Dear child! Now, listen to me. We\u0027ll make an agreement. Let me have the first shot in this business. If we can get him out through the front door, with everybody cheering and shaking his hands, that will be better than an escape through the window, and living in hiding and in fear the rest of his life, won\u0027t it? But if that doesn\u0027t work,--if I see surely that the only way to save him from the vengeance of the law is to steal him away,--then I am with you, to the bitter end. I\u0027ll meet you with disguise, rope ladder, anything you can think of. But let me have my chance first, in my own way. Agreed?\" \n \n She stopped in the street to put out her hand and shake mine firmly. Her eyes were as bright and steady as pilot lights. \n \n \"I think you are perfectly splendid,\" she said with conviction. I have forgotten some important things in my life and I expect to forget a good many more, but I shall never forget the thrill that came to me with that absurd, girlish endorsement! I think it was the way she said it that made it seem so much like a gold medal pinned upon my breast. \n \n \"I shall arrange for you to have a quiet talk with your brother, and then I\u0027ll leave you for a while. You will probably be watched, but I think you can speak without being overheard. I want you to remember carefully what your brother says.\" \n \n \"And tell you?\" she asked doubtfully, leaping ahead of my words, as I found she had a way of doing. \n \n \"If he asks you to send a message to anyone, or asks about anyone in particular, I want to know it. Your brother is keeping something from me, Miss Jean, and I must find out what it is, in order to do him justice. I think there is someone else involved in this affair, and that he is keeping silence to his own hurt. Just remember that this is what I must find out about, somehow, and if he says anything--anything--that would show who is in his mind, that you must tell me.\" \n \n \"I understand,\" she said, wide-eyed. \"But whom could he care for so much as that?\" \n \n \"You can\u0027t help me by a guess?\" \n \n \"No. I\u0027m afraid not. Gene writes beautiful letters when he wants to, but not like girls\u0027 letters, you know. Not about every little thing.\" \n \n We found Gene, as I had found him before, the polite, nice-mannered boy, evidently trying somewhat anxiously to deport himself as a gentleman should under unrehearsed conditions. \n \n \"I have brought your sister for a little visit,\" I said. \"I am coming for her after a little. I have arranged that you shall not be disturbed, so you may talk to her freely and without hesitation.\" \n \n \"Oh, thank you! I hope I am not putting you to any trouble. I\u0027m so sorry, Jean, that you should have to come here to see me. It isn\u0027t at all the right place for a girl.\" He looked as apologetic and disturbed as though he had brought her there inadvertently. \n \n I left them together for half an hour and then went back for Jean. Eugene detained me for a moment after Jean had said her last cooing goodbye. \n \n \"I wish you would tell her not to come here,\" he said anxiously. \"It won\u0027t look well. I can stand it alone all right. Honest, I can.\" \n \n I couldn\u0027t help liking the boy, though his anxiety to save his sister from unpleasant comment was somewhat inconsistent with his action in bringing this greater anxiety to her. \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe I could keep her away,\" I said. \"You will have to stand that as a part--of it all.\" \n \n He flushed in instant comprehension. I should have been ashamed of prodding him, if I hadn\u0027t felt that it was necessary to make him as uncomfortable as possible in order to get him out of his heroics and make him confess more ingenuously than he had done up to this time. \n \n I joined Jean, and walked to the car with her. \"Well?\" I asked. \n \n \"He didn\u0027t say anything,\" she answered gravely. \"Of course I told him that I thought he had done exactly right, and that I was proud of him, and that you were going to take care of all the law business and make it all right, and he wasn\u0027t to worry and I would come and see him. Of course I am not going back to school.\" \n \n \"You will live with your uncle, Mr. Ellison?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid it will be a lonely and trying time for you. I wish I might do something to make things easier for you. Will you let me know if there ever is anything I can do?\" \n \n \"You can come and tell me how things are going,\" she said wistfully. \"I don\u0027t understand about law, you know, and--it\u0027s lonesome waiting. If I could do something,--\" \n \n \"You promised to leave that to me, you know,\" I said, anxious to keep her from forgetting what an important person I was in this affair! \n \n She did not answer for a moment, and then she looked up with a brave assumption of cheer. \n \n \"I\u0027d be ashamed to get blue when Gene is so plucky. He doesn\u0027t think about himself at all. He is only worried to death for fear Miss Thurston should be disturbed.\" \n \n \"Is he great friends with Miss Thurston?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, indeed. He asked about her first of all, and over and over again. He wanted me to be sure and go and see her at once, and tell her that he is all right.\" \n \n \"Shall I put you on the car here, then? I am going down to St. James\u0027 Hospital to see our man.\" \n \n \"Oh, mayn\u0027t I go with you?\" she cried eagerly. \"You know I have a share in him, too.\" \n \n \"Of course you have,--a very large share. Yes, come on. We\u0027ll see what he has to say for himself.\" \n \n As it turned out, he had more to say for us than for himself. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2044/58290.html","bookId":608,"book":{"id":608,"title":"The Saintsbury Affair","description":"简介： Let me see where the story begins.
