{"id":26317,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV THE OUTLAW","content":"I shook my head at Clyde, and returned to the sitting room. \"Have you seen Clyde since the news came out, Mr. Hilton?\" the energetic reporter demanded, as I was passing the cigars around. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have been out of town. I only returned last evening.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It seems that he left his office without any instructions, and nobody knows how to get his orders. And at his home nothing is known. He simply walked out of the door and disappeared.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then the chances are that he is far enough away by this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he\u0027ll be caught,\" the man said confidently. \"It is one of the hardest things in the world for a man to be lost in this world of rapid communication. His description has been wired all over the country. The police in every city in the land will have their eyes open. Sooner or later--and the chances are that it will be sooner--some one will tap him on the shoulder and say, \u0027You\u0027re wanted, Mr. Clyde.\u0027 And he\u0027ll forget himself and answer to the name. They all do it. Sooner or later.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He wagged his head wisely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" chimed in the others, and story after story was told of the unconscious way in which men in hiding would betray themselves. It was entertaining enough, but I was on needles to have them go, and I got rid of them as soon as I could. I waited until I saw them actually leave the building before I dared let Clyde out of the bedroom. He came out smiling and undisturbed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are your prophetic friends safely out of the way?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All gone. How in the name of mystery did you get in here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look more surprised than hospitable!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And more anxious than either, I dare say, if my looks show my feelings. How are you going to get away?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Walk away. And very soon. But first, I wonder if you could get me something to eat. Absurd how dependent we civilized beings are on our meals! There may be more serious matters to be considered, but at present my chief anxiety is as to whether you happen to have a box of crackers and a piece of cheese in your rooms.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do better than that,\" I answered, and I promptly telephoned to a near-by restaurant for a substantial meal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, while we are waiting, tell me how you got in,\" I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that was easy. I simply walked up. I thought I should find you, but you are an abominably early riser. The maids were cleaning the rooms, and so I simply watched for an opportunity to slip into one room while they were in the other. You have comfortable diggings here, and I commend your taste in pictures, but I vow I never saw so hungry a place in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you really had nothing all day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing since yesterday noon. It was about the middle of the afternoon yesterday that a fellow came to my office,--a man I had never seen. He told me that he was a typesetter on the Samovar. \u0027Beg pardon,\u0027 he said, \u0027but you\u0027re Mr. Clyde, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 I acknowledged it. He said, \u0027I\u0027m a machine operator on the Samovar, and I had a \"take\" just now that had a story about you in it. Some dirty story about your having been convicted of murder and escaping before you were hung.\u0027 \u0027Indeed?\u0027 I said. \u0027It was kind of you to warn me. To whom am I indebted?\u0027 He looked down and shuffled his feet. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m nothing but a machine operator, but I don\u0027t want to see a man that is bucking the ring knifed.\u0027 And that is all that I know about him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some local politician, probably.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he laughed. \"It is a queer world, the way we are bound up with each other. If I hadn\u0027t accepted that nomination on the Citizens\u0027 ticket, that bow-legged little machine man, who probably had to lose a day\u0027s wage to get away and warn me, would never have bothered. He took the trouble because I was his candidate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the way, I saw Miss Thurston to-day. She gave me this letter to get to you if I should have a chance.\" And I gave him her letter and turned away to arrange his supper while he should read it. I rather fancy he forgot his hunger for a few minutes. I could guess something of what Miss Thurston must have written by his face. It was white with emotion when he finished. He put the letter into his pocket-book, carefully. Then he turned to me, half laughing but without speaking, and wrung my hand. We understood each other without anything further. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, specifically, did you come back for?\" I asked, while he was eating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, partly because the enemy would be looking for me elsewhere, but chiefly because I had to get some money. How much have you about you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I emptied my pockets and spread the loot before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so bad,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll give you a check for it, and date it yesterday. Then I should like to have you, as my lawyer, take possession of the papers in my desk. There are insurance policies that have to be taken care of, and some other matters that can\u0027t be neglected. And the Lord knows when I can come back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No one else knows,\" I assured him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled. I could see that he was too uplifted to really care very much about such trivialities as I had my mind upon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t advise me to stay and brazen it out, then?\" he said, quizzically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the contrary, I advise you to clear out. I don\u0027t see the ghost of a chance for you if the law gets its hands upon you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then a judicial error can never be corrected?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The only thing that would give us any excuse for reopening the case would be some new evidence having a bearing on the situation. Have you any reason to suppose that you can unearth any significant facts now which you could not discover when the affair was fresh in the memory of everyone?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shook his head. \"No. That looks hopeless, I must admit. You advise me, then, to bury myself somewhere beyond reach of the extradition laws?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly. And, considering everything, I can imagine worse fates.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled. \"So can I,\" he said musingly. For a man with a price on his head, he seemed singularly happy. It was clear that the letter in his pocket was the most potent writ in the world just then. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he put dreams aside, and gave me specific directions as to certain matters of business that he wished looked after. It was on toward eleven o\u0027clock before our talk was finished, and he rose to his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are your plans now?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To get out of town, first. I must walk. Let me have that stick of yours, will you? I think I shall have to go stooping over a cane, to escape notice. And when I have an address to give you, I\u0027ll let you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" I agreed. \\n\\n \\n\\n He pulled his hat into a bedraggled shape over his ears, and walked stiffly about the room, bent over the cane. I had not guessed him so good an actor. I walked with him down the street a few minutes later,--and I knew that he carried a lighter heart into exile than he had carried through all the popularity and success of the last fifteen years. After making sure that he was not followed or observed, I left him, and returned home. I took a different route, one that brought me through a little park, where a fountain plashed in the soft night air, and the trees bent over the benches whereon homeless tramps and cosy \"twos\" enjoyed the last minute of freedom. As I crossed the park by one of the diagonal asphalt paths, my eye was caught by the familiar aspect of the drooping shoulders of a man who sat beside a girl on a secluded bench. It looked like Fellows. He moved slightly, and I saw that I was not mistaken. That he should be spending the evening in the park was not remarkable, but that he should be in close conversation with a girl was distinctly surprising. But I was very glad to see it. A girl would be the best panacea for his moodiness. I would not embarrass him by giving any sign of recognition. I therefore walked past with my eyes ahead, but just as I came opposite, the girl moved and the light of the street lamp fell on her face. I had seen her before,--for a minute I could not remember where. Then it came to me. She was Minnie Doty, Mr. Ellison\u0027s housemaid. How in the name of wonder had Fellows picked up an acquaintance with her? \\n\\n \\n\\n I wished afterwards that my delicacy had not led me to go by without speaking. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2044/58297.html","bookId":608,"book":{"id":608,"title":"The Saintsbury Affair","description":"简介： Let me see where the story begins.
