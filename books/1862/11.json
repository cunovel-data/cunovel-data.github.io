But shelost time undoing the bolts on the front door, and\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette could hear the quick tap, tap, tap of somebody running away.\\n\\n Jade threw the door open, darted out onto theporch-and screamed. Mary-Lynnette crowded forward\\n\\n and saw that Jade had put her foot into oneof the holes where the porch was missing a board. Everybody\\n\\n who didn\u0027t know the place did that. Butthat wasn\u0027t what had made her scream.\\n\\n It was the goat.\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" Mark said. \"Oh, God-who would dothat?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette took one look and felt a burning inher chest and arms-a painful, bad feeling. Her lungs\\n\\n seemed to contract and her breath was forced out.\\n\\n Her vision blurred.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get it inside,\" Rowan said. \"Jade, are youall right?\"\\n\\n Jade was taking In ragged, whooping breaths. Shesounded the way Mary-Lynnette felt. Mark leaned\\n\\n over to help pull her out of the hole.\\n\\n Rowan and Kestrel were lifting the goat by its legs.Mary-Lynnette was backing into the house, teeth\\n\\n clamped on her already-bitten lip. The taste of copperwas like a blood dot in her mouth.\\n\\n They put the goat on an old-fashioned patternedrug in the entrance to the living room. Jade\u0027s whooping\\n\\n breaths turned into gasping sobs.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Ethyl,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She felt like sobbing too.\\n\\n She knelt beside Ethyl. The goat was pure white, with a sweet face and a broad forehead. Mary\\n\\n Lynnette reached out to touch one hoof gently. She\u0027dhelped Mrs. B. trim that hoof with pruning shears.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s dead,\" Kestrel said. \"You can\u0027t hurt her.\"Mary-Lynnette looked up quickly. Kestrel\u0027s face\\n\\n was composed and distant. Shock rippled under MaryLynnette\u0027s skin.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s take them out,\" Rowan said.\\n\\n \"The hide\u0027s ruined already,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n \"Kestrel, please-\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette stood. \"Kestrel, shut up!\"\\n\\n There was a pause. To Mary-Lynnette\u0027s astonishment, the pause went on. Kestrel stayed shut up.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette and Rowan began to pull the little wooden stakes out of the goat\u0027s body.\\n\\n Some were as small as toothpicks. Others were longer than Mary-Lynnette\u0027s finger and thicker than\\n\\n a shish kebab skewer, with a dull point at one end.Somebody strong did this, Mary-Lynnette thought.\\n\\n Strong enough to punch splinters of wood throughgoat hide.\\n\\n Over and over again. Ethyl was pierced everywhere. Hundreds of times. She looked like a porcupine.\\n\\n \"There wasn\u0027t much bleeding,\" Rowan said softly.\"That means she was dead when it was done.\\n\\n Andlook here.\" She gently touched Ethyl\u0027s neck. Thewhite coat was crimson there-just like the deer,\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette thought.\\n\\n \"Somebody either cut her throat or bit it,\" Rowansaid. \"So it was probably quick for her and she\\n\\n bledout. Not like ...\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Mary-Lynnette said.\\n\\n Rowan hesitated. She looked up at Jade. Jade sniffled and wiped her nose on Mark\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n Rowan looked back at Mary-Lynnette. \"Not like Uncle Hodge.\" She looked back down and carefully\\n\\n loosened another stake, adding it to the pile theywere accumulating. \"You see, they killed Unde Hodge\\n\\n this way, the Elders did. Only he was alivewhen they did it.\"\\n\\n For a moment Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t speak. Thenshe said, \"Why?\"\\n\\n Rowan pulled out two more stakes, her face controlled and intent. \"For telling a human about theNight\\n\\n World.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette sat back on her heels and lookedat Mark.\\n\\n Mark sat down on the floor, bringing Jade withhim.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why Aunt Opal left the island,\" Rowansaid.\\n\\n \"And now somebody\u0027s staked Aunt Opal,\" Kestrel said. \"And somebody\u0027s killed a goat in the\\n\\n same wayUnde Hodge was killed.\"\\n\\n \"Butwho?\" Mary-Lynnette said.\\n\\n Rowan shook her head. \"Somebody who knowsabout vampires.\"\\n\\n Mark\u0027s blue eyes looked darker than usual and alittle glazed. \"You were talkingbefore about a vam pire\\n\\n hunter.\\n\\n \"That gets my vote,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n \"Okay, so who around here is a vampire hunter?What\u0027s a vampire hunter?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the problem,\" Rowan said. \"I don\u0027t knowhow you could tell who is one. I\u0027m not even sure\\n\\n Ibelieve in vampire hunters.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re supposed to be humans who\u0027ve found out about the Night World,\" Jade said, pushing\\n\\n tears outof her eyes with her palms. \"And they can\u0027t get otherpeople to believe them-or maybe they don\u0027t\\n\\n want other people to know. So they hunt us. You know, trying to kill us one by one. They\u0027re supposed\\n\\n toknow as much about the Night World as Night People do.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, like knowing how your uncle was executed\" Mary-Lynnette said.\\n\\n \"Yes, but that\u0027s not much of a secret,\" Rowan said.\"I mean, you wouldn\u0027t have to actually know\\n\\n aboutUncle Hodge to think of it-It\u0027s the traditionalmethod of execution among the lamia. There aren\u0027t\\n\\n many things besides staking and burning that will killa vampire.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette thought about this. It didn\u0027t getthem very far. Who would want to kill an old ladyand a\\n\\n goat?\\n\\n \"Rowan? Why did your aunt have goats? I mean, I always thought it was for the milk, but...\"\\n\\n \"It was for the blood, I\u0027m sure,\" Rowan saidcalmly. \"If she looked as old as you said, she\\n\\n probablycouldn\u0027t get out into the woods to hunt.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette looked at the goat again, trying tofind other dues, trying to be a good observer detached,\\n\\n methodical. When her eyes got to Ethyl\u0027s muzzle, she blinked and leaned forward.\\n\\n \"I-there\u0027s something in her mouth.\"\\n\\n \"Please tell me you\u0027re joking,\" Mark said.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette just waved a hand at him. \"Ican\u0027t-I need something to...hang on a sec.\" Sheran into the\\n\\n kitchen and opened a drawer. She snagged a richly decorated sterling silver knife and ran back to the\\n\\n living room.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she grunted as she pried Ethyl\u0027s teeth farther open. There wassomething in\\n\\n there-something like a flower, but black. She worked it out with her fingers.\\n\\n \"Silence of the Goats,\" Mark muttered.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette ignored him, turning the disintegrating thing over in her hands. \"It looks like aniris-but it\u0027s\\n\\n spray-painted black.\"\\n\\n Jade and Rowan exchanged grim glances. \"Wellthis has somethingto do with the Night World,\" Rowan\\n\\n said. \"If we weren\u0027t sure of that before, weare now. Black flowers are the symbols of the Night World.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette put the sodden iris down. \"Symbols, like ... ?\"\\n\\n \"We wear them to identify ourselves to each other.You know, on rings or pins or clothes or\\n\\n things like that. Each species has its own kind of flower, andthen there are other flowers that mean you\\n\\n belongto a certain dub or family. Witches use black dahlias, werewolves use black foxglove; made\\n\\n vampires use black roses ...\"\\n\\n \"And there\u0027s a chain of dubs called the Black Iris,\"Kestrel said, coming to stand by the others. \"I\\n\\n know because Ash belongs to one.\"\\n\\n \"Ash... \" Jade said, staring at Kestrel with widegreen eyes.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette sat frozen. Something was tugginginsistently at the corner of her consciousness. Some\\n\\n thing about a black design....\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" she said. \"Oh, God-I know somebody who wears a ring with a black flower on it.\"\\n\\n Everyone looked at her.\\n\\n \"Who?\" Mark said, at the same time as Rowansaid it. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know which of them\\n\\n looked more surprised.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette struggled with herself for a minute.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Jeremy Lovett,\" she said finally. Not toosteadily.\\n\\n Mark made a face. \"That oddball. He lives by himself in a trailer in the woods, and last summer ...\"\\n\\n Mark\u0027s voice died out. His jaw dropped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly. \"And last sum\\n\\n mer they found a body right out near there.\"\\n\\n \"Can you tell?\" Mary-Lynnette asked Rowan qui\\n\\n etly. \"If somebody\u0027s a Night Person?\"\\n\\n \"Well ...\" Rowan looked dismayed. \"Well-not for sure. If somebody was experienced at shielding\\n\\n their mind ...Well, we might be able to startle them into revealing something. But otherwise, no. Notfor\\n\\n certain. \"\\n\\n Mark leaned back. \"Oh, terrific. Well, I think Jeremy would make a great Night Person. Actually, so\\n\\n would Vic Kimble and Todd Akers.\"\\n\\n \"Todd,\" Jade said. \"Now, wait a minute.\" Shepicked up one of the toothpicks that had been em\\n\\n bedded in the goat and stared at it.\\n\\n Rowan was looking at Mary-Lynnette. \"No matterwhat, we should go and see your friend Jeremy. He\u0027ll\\n\\n probably turn out to be completely innocent-sometimes a human gets hold of one of our rings or pins,\\n\\n and then things get reallyconfusing. Especially if they wander into one of our dubs....\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette wasn\u0027t so sure. She had a terrible, terrible sick feeling. The way Jeremy kept to himself,\\n\\n the way he always seemed to be an outsider atschool--even his untamed good looks and his easy way of\\n\\n moving ... No, it all seemed to lead to one conclusion. She had solved the mystery of Jeremy Lovett at\\n\\n last, and it wasnot a happy ending.\\n\\n Kestrel said \"Okay, fine; we can go check this Jeremy guy out. But what about Ash?\"\\n\\n \"What about Ash?\" Rowan said. The last stake wasout. She gently turned one side of the rug\\n\\n over the body of the goat, like a shroud.\\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s his dub flower. Somaybe somebody from his dub did it.\" \"Urn, I know\\n\\n I\u0027m starting to sound like a brokenrecord,\" Mark said. \"But I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\\n\\n Who\u0027s Ash?\"\\n\\n The three sisters looked at him. Mary-Lynnette looked away. After so many missed opportunities, it\\n\\n was going to sound extremely peculiar when she casually mentioned that, oh, yes, she\u0027d met Ash. Twice.\\n\\n But she didn\u0027t have a choice anymore. She had to tell.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s our brother,\" Kestrel was saying.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s crazy,\" Jade said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the only one from our family who migh.know that we\u0027re here in Briar Creek,\" Rowan said.\\n\\n \"He found megiving a letter to Crane Linden to smuggle off the island. But Idon\u0027t think he noticedAunt\\n\\n Opal\u0027s address on it. He\u0027s not much good at noticing things that aren\u0027t about him.\"\\n\\n \"You can say that again,\" Jade said. \"All Ashthinksabout is Ash. He\u0027s completely self-centered.\"\\n\\n \"All he does is chase girls and party,\" Kestrel said,with one of those smiles that made\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette wonder if she really disapproved. \"And hunt.\"\\n\\n \u0027He doesn\u0027t like humans,\"Jade said. \"If he didn\u0027t like chasing human girls and playing with them, he\u0027d\\n\\n probably be planning towipe out all the humans and take over the world.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like a great guy,\" Mark said.\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s sort of conservative,\" Rowan said. \u0027Politically, I mean. Personally, he\u0027s--\"\\n\\n \"Loose,\" Kestrel suggested, eyebrows up.\\n\\n \"To put it mildly,\" Jade agreed. \"There\u0027s only onething he wants when he goes after human girls\\n\\n besides their cars, I mean.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s heart was pounding. With every second that passed it was getting harder to speak up.\\n\\n And every time she took a breath, somebody else started talking.\\n\\n 0\"So, wait you think he did all this stuff?\" Mark asked.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t put it past him,\" Kestrel said. Jade nodded vigorously.\\n\\n \"But his own aunt ,\"Mark said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027d do it if he thought the honor of the familywas involved,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n \"Yes, well, there\u0027s one problem with all that,\" Rowan said tightly. \"Ash isn\u0027t here. He\u0027s in\\n\\n California.\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s not,\" Ash said casually, from the back ofthe living room. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-11.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \\n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
