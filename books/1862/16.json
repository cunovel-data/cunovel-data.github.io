{"id":82080,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"After that, things happened very fast, and at the same time with a dreamy slowness. Mary-Lynnette felt\\n\\n her arms grabbed from behind. Something was pulling her hands together-somethingstrong. Then she felt\\n\\n the bite of cord on her wrists, and she realized what was happening.\\n\\n Tied up-I\u0027m going to be helpless-I\u0027ve got todosomething fast....\\n\\n She fought, trying to wrench herself away, trying to kick. But it was already too late. Her hands were\\n\\n secure behind her back-and some part of her mind noted distantly that no wonder people on cop shows\\n\\n yell when they\u0027re handcuffed. Ithurt. Her shoulders gave a shriek of agony as she was dragged backward\\n\\n up against a tree.\\n\\n \"Stop fighting,\" a voice snarled. A thick, distorted voice she didn\u0027t recognize. She tried to see\\n\\n who it was, but the tree was in the way. \"If you relax itwon\u0027t hurt.\"\\n\\n . Mary-Lynnette kept fighting, but it didn\u0027t make any difference. She could feel the deeply furrowedbark\\n\\n of the tree against her hands and back-and now she couldn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Oh, God, oh, God-1 can\u0027t get away. Iwas alreadyweak from what Ash and I did-and now I can\u0027t move\\n\\n at all.\\n\\n Then stop panicking andthink, her inner voice said fiercely. Use your brain instead of getting hysterical.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette stopped struggling. She stood panting and tried to get control of her terror.\\n\\n \"I told you. It only hurts when you fight. A lot of things are like that,\" the voice said.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette twisted her head and saw who it was.\\n\\n Her heart gave a sick lurch. She shouldn\u0027t havebeen surprised, but she was-surprised and infi nitely\\n\\n disappointed.\\n\\n \"Oh, Jeremy,\" she whispered.\\n\\n Except that it was a different Jeremy than the one she knew. His face was the same, his hair, his\\n\\n clothes-but there was something weird about him, something powerful and scary and ...unknowable. His\\n\\n eyes were as inhuman and flat as a shark\u0027s.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you,\" he said in that distorted stranger\u0027s voice. \"I only tied you up because I\\n\\n didn\u0027t want you to interfere.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind was registering different things in different layers. One part said, MyGod, he\u0027s\\n\\n trying to be friendly, and another part said, Tointerferewith what? and a third part just kept saying Ash.\\n\\n She looked at Ash. He was lyingverystill, andMary-Lynnette\u0027s wonderful new eyes that could seecolors\\n\\n in moonlight saw that his blond hair was slowly soaking with blood. On the ground beside himwas a club\\n\\n made of yew - made of the hard yellow sapwood. No wonder he was unconscious.\\n\\n But if he\u0027s bleeding he\u0027s not dead-oh, God, please,he can\u0027tbe dead-Rowan said that only staking and\\n\\n burning kill vampires....\\n\\n \"I have to take dare of him,\" Jeremy said. \"And then I\u0027ll let you go, I promise. Once I explain\\n\\n everything, you\u0027ll understand.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette looked up from Ash to the strangerwith Jeremy\u0027s face. With a shock, she realized what\\n\\n he meant by \"take care of.\" Three words that were just part of life to a hunterto a werewolf.\\n\\n So now I know about werewolves. They\u0027re killers and I was right all along. I was right and Rowan was\\n\\n wrong.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll only take a minute,\" Jeremy said-and hislips drew back.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s heart seemed to slam violently inside her chest. Because his lips went farther up than\\n\\n any human\u0027s lips could. She could see his gums, whitish-pink. And she could see why his voice didn\u0027t\\n\\n sound like Jeremy\u0027s-it was his teeth.\\n\\n White teeth in the moonlight. The teeth from herdream. Vampire teeth were nothing compared to this.\\n\\n The incisors at the front were made for cutting fleshfrom prey, the canines were two inches long, the teeth\\n\\n behind them looked designed for slicing and shearing.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette suddenly remembered-somethingVic Kimble\u0027s father had said three years ago. He\u0027d\\n\\n said that a wolf could snap off the tail of a full-grown cow clean as pruning shears. He\u0027d been\\n\\n complaining that somebody had let a wolf-dog crossbreed looseand it was going after his cattle....\\n\\n Except that of course it wasn\u0027t a crossbreed, Mary-Lynnette thought. It was Jeremy. I saw him everyday\\n\\n at school-and then he must have gone hometo look like this. Tohunt.\\n\\n Just now, as he stood over Ash with his teeth all exposed and his chest heaving, Jeremy looked\\n\\n completely, quietly insane.\\n\\n \"But why?\" Mary-Lynnette burst out.\"Whydo youwant to hurt him?\"\\n\\n Jeremy looked up-and she got another shock. His eyes were different. Before she\u0027d seen them flash\\n\\n white in the darkness. Now they had no whites at all. They were brown with large liquid pupils. Theeyes\\n\\n of an animal.\\n\\n So it doesn\u0027t need to be a full moon, she thought. He can change anytime.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know?\" he said. \"Doesn\u0027t anybody understand?This ismy territory.\"\\n\\n Oh.Oh ...\\n\\n So it was as simple as that. After all their brainstorming and arguing and detective work. In the end it\\n\\n was something as basic as an animal protectingits range.\\n\\n \"For a hunting range, it is small,\" Rowan had said.\\n\\n \"They were taking my game,\" Jeremy said. \"My deer, my squirrels. They didn\u0027t have any right to\\n\\n dothat. I tried to make them leave-but they wouldn\u0027t.They stayed and they kept killing....\"\\n\\n He stopped talking-but a new sound came fromhim. It started out almost below the range of MaryLynnette\u0027s hearing-but the deep rumbling of itstruck some primal chord of terror in her. It was asuncanny\\n\\n and inhuman as the danger-hum of an at tacking swarm of bees.\\n\\n Growling. He was growling. And it wasreal.The snarling growl a dog makes that tells you to turn and\\n\\n run. The sound it makes before it springs at yourthroat....\\n\\n \"Jeremy!\" Mary-Lynnette screamed. She threwherself forward, ignoring the white blaze of pain in\\n\\n her shoulders. But the cord held. She was jerked back. And Jeremy fell on Ash, lunging down, head\\n\\n darting forward like a striking snake, like a biting dog, like every animal that kills with its teeth.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette heard someone screaming \"No!\"and only later realized that it was her. She was fight ing\\n\\n with the cord, and she could feel stinging and wetness at her wrists. But she couldn\u0027t get free andshe\\n\\n couldn\u0027t stop seeing what was happening in frontof her. And all the time that eerie, vicious growling that\\n\\n reverberated in Mary-Lynnette\u0027s own head and chest.\\n\\n That was when things went cold and dear. Some part of Mary-Lynnette that was stronger than the panic\\n\\n took over. It stepped back and looked at the entire scene by the roadside: the car, which was still\\n\\n burning, sending clouds of choking white smokewhenever the wind blew the right way; the limpfigure of\\n\\n Ash on the pine needles; the blur of snarling motion that was Jeremy.\\n\\n \"Jeremy!\" she said, and her throat hurt, but hervoice was calm-and commanding. \"Jeremy-before\\n\\n you do that-don\u0027t you want me tounderstand? You said that was what you wanted. Jeremy,help me\\n\\n understand.\"\\n\\n For a long second she thought in dismay that it wasn\u0027t going to work. That he couldn\u0027t even hear her. But\\n\\n then his head lifted. She saw his face; she saw the blood on his chin.\\n\\n Don\u0027t scream, don\u0027t scream, Mary-Lynnette toldherself frantically. Don\u0027t show any shock. You have to\\n\\n keep him talking, keep him away from Ash.\\n\\n Behind her back her hands were working automatically, as if trying to get out of ropes was something\\n\\n they\u0027d always known how to do. The slick wetness actually helped. She could feel the cords slide a little.\\n\\n \"Please help me understand,\" she said again, breathless, but trying to hold Jeremy\u0027s eyes. \"I\u0027m\\n\\n your friend-you know that. We go back a long way.\"\\n\\n Jeremy\u0027s whitish gums were streaked with red. He still had human features, but there was nothing at all\\n\\n human about that face.\\n\\n Now, though-slowly-his lips came down tocover his gums. He looked more like a person andless like an\\n\\n animal. And when he spoke, his voicewas distorted, but she could recognize it as Jere my\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"We do go back,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve watched you sincewe were kids-and I\u0027ve seen you watching\\n\\n me.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette nodded.She couldn\u0027tgetany words out.\\n\\n \"I always figured that someday, when we wereolder-maybe we\u0027d be together. I thought maybe I\\n\\n could make you understand. About me. About everything. I thought you were the one person who might\\n\\n not be afraid....\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" Mary-Lynnette said, and hoped hervoice wasn\u0027t shaking too badly. She was saying it to\\n\\n a figure in a blood-spattered shirt crouching over a torn body like a beast still ready to attack.\\n\\n MaryLynnette didn\u0027t dare look at Ash to see how badly hewas hurt. She kept her eyes locked on\\n\\n Jeremy\u0027s. \"And I think I can understand. You killed Mrs. Burdock, didn\u0027t you? Because she was on your\\n\\n territory.\"\\n\\n \"Nother; \" Jeremy said, and his voice was sharpwith impatience. \"She was just an old lady-she\\n\\n didn\u0027t hunt. I didn\u0027t mind having her in my range. Ieven did things for her, like fixing her fence andporch\\n\\n for free.... And that\u0027s when she told methey were coming. Those girls.\"\\n\\n Just the way she told me, Mary-Lynnette thought, with dazed revelation. And he was there fixing the\\n\\n fence-of course. The way he does odd jobs for everybody.\\n\\n \"I told her it wouldn\u0027t work.\" Mary-Lynnette couldhear it again-the beginnings of a snarling growl.\\n\\n Jeremy was tense and trembling, and she could feel her self start to tremble, too. \"Three more hunters in\\n\\n thislittle place ... I told her, but she wouldn\u0027t listen. She couldn\u0027t see. So then I lost my temper.\"\\n\\n Don\u0027t look at Ash, don\u0027t call attention to him,\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette thought desperately. Jeremy\u0027s lips were drawing back again as if he needed something to\\n\\n attack. At the same time the distant part of hermind said, So that\u0027s why he used a picket\u003dAsh was right;it\\n\\n was an impulse of the moment.\\n\\n \"Well, anybody can lose their temper,\" she said, and even though her voice cracked and there\\n\\n were tears in her eyes, Jeremy seemed to calm a little.\\n\\n \"Afterward, I thought maybe it was for the best,\" he said, sounding tired. \"I thought when the girls\\n\\n found her, they\u0027d know they had to leave. I waited for them to do it. I\u0027m good at waiting.\"\\n\\n He was staring past her, into the woods. Heart pounding, Mary-Lynnette grabbed the opportunity todart\\n\\n a look at Ash.\\n\\n Oh, God, he\u0027s not moving at all. And there\u0027s so muchblood....I\u0027ve never seen so much blood....\\n\\n She twisted her wrists back and forth, trying to find some give in the cords.\\n\\n \"I watched, but they didn\u0027t go away,\" Jeremy said.Mary-Lynnette\u0027s eyes jerked back to him.\\n\\n \"Instead youcame. I heard Mark talking to Jade in the garden. She said she\u0027d decided she was going to\\n\\n like it here. And then ... I got mad. I made a noise and they heard me.\"\\n\\n His face was changing. The flesh was actually moving in front of Mary-Lynnette\u0027s eyes. His cheekbones\\n\\n were broadening, his nose and mouth jutting. Hairwas creeping between his eyebrows, turning them into\\n\\n a straight bar. She couldsee individual coarse hairs sprouting, dark against pale skin.\\n\\n I\u0027m going to be sick....\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Mary-Lynnette?\" He got up and she saw that his body was changing, too. It was\\n\\n stilla human body, but it was too thin-stretched out.As if it were just long bones and sinews.\\n\\n \"Nothing\u0027s wrong,\" Mary-Lynnette got out in a whisper. She twisted violently at her cords-and felt\\n\\n That\u0027s it. Now keep him distracted, keep him moving away from Ash....\\n\\n \"Go on,\" she said breathlessly. \"What happenedthen?\"\\n\\n \"I knew I had to send them a message. I cameback the next night for the goat-but you were there\\n\\n again. You ran away from me into the shed.\" Hemoved closer again and the moonlight caught his\\n\\n eyes-and reflected. The pupils shone greenish-orange. Mary-Lynnette could only stare.\\n\\n That shadow in the clearing-those eyes I saw. Nota coyote.Him.He was following us everywhere.\\n\\n The very thought made her skin creep. But there was another thought that was worsethe picture of him\\n\\n killing the goat. Doing it carefully, methodically-as a message.\\n\\n That was why he didn\u0027t eat the heart and liver,Mary-Lynnette realized. He didn\u0027t kill it for foodit wasn\u0027t a\\n\\n normal werewolf killing. And he\u0027s not a normal werewolf.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t at all like what Rowan had described-a noble animal that hunted to eat. Instead he was ... a\\n\\n mad dog.\\n\\n Of all people,Ash had it right. Him and his jokes about rabies ...\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so beautiful, you know,\" Jeremy said suddenly. \"I\u0027ve always thought that. I love your\\n\\n hair.\"\\n\\n He was right in her face. She could see the individual pores in his skin with coarse hairs growing out of\\n\\n them. And she couldsmellhim-the feral smell ofa zoo.\\n\\n He reached out to touch her hair, and his handhad dark, thick fingernails. Mary-Lynnette could feelher\\n\\n eyes getting wider. Say something ...say some thing ... don\u0027t show you\u0027re afraid.\\n\\n \"You knew how Mrs. Burdock\u0027s husband was killed,\" she got out.\\n\\n \"She told me a long time ago,\" Jeremy said almost absently, still moving his fingers in her hair.\\n\\n He\u0027d changed so much that his voice was getting hard to understand. \"I used little sticks from my models\\n\\n ...you know I make models. And a black iris forhim.Ash.\" Jeremy said the name with pure hatred. \"I saw\\n\\n him that day with his stupid T-shirt. The Black IrisClub . . . my uncle belonged to that once. Theytreated\\n\\n him like he was second-class.\"\\n\\n His eyes were inches from Mary-Lynnette\u0027s; she felt the brush of a fingernail on her ear. Suddenlyshe\\n\\n had the strength to give a violent wrench behind her back-and one hand came free. She froze, afraid that\\n\\n Jeremy would notice.\\n\\n \"I threw the goat on the porch and ran,\" Jeremysaid, almost crooning the words as he petted\\n\\n MaryLynnette. \"I knew you were all in there. I was somad-I killed that horse and I kept running. I\\n\\n smashed the gas station window. I was going to bum it downbut then I decided to wait.\"\\n\\n Yes,and yes, and yes, Mary-Lynnette thought, even as she carefully worked her other wrist free,even as\\n\\n she stared into Jeremy\u0027s crazy eyes andsmelled his animal breath. Yes, of course it was youwe heard\\n\\n running away-and you didn\u0027t fall into the hole in the porch because you knew it was there, because you\\n\\n were fixing it. And yes, you were the one who smashed the window-who else would hate the gas station\\n\\n but somebody who worked there?\\n\\n 0Her fingers eased the cord off her other wrist. She felt a surge of fierce triumph-but she controlled her\\n\\n expression and clenched her hands, trying to thinkof what to do. He was so strong and so quick ... if she\\n\\n just threw herself at him, she wouldn\u0027t have a chance.\\n\\n \"And today you all came to town together,\" Jeremy said, finishing the story quietly, through a\\n\\n mouth so inhuman it was hard to believe it could speak English. \"I heard the wayhe was talking toyou. I\\n\\n knew he wanted you-and he wanted to change you into one of them. I had to protect you from that.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette said almost steadily, \"I knew youwanted to protect me. I could tell, Jeremy.\" She was\\n\\n feeling over the furrowed hemlock bark behind her.How could she attack him when she didn\u0027t even have\\n\\n a stick for a weapon? And even if shehad,wood was no good. He wasn\u0027t a vampire.\\n\\n Jeremy stepped back. Relief washed over Mary-Lynnette-for one second. Then she saw with horror\\n\\n that he was plucking at his shirt, pulling it off. And underneath ...there was no skin. Instead there was\\n\\n hair. A pelt that twitched and shivered in the night air. \"I followed you here and I fixed your car so you\\n\\n couldn\u0027t leave,\" Jeremy said. \"I heard you say youwanted to be a vampire.\"\\n\\n \"Jeremy-that was justtalk....\"\\n\\n He went on as if she hadn\u0027t spoken. \"But that was a mistake. Werewolves are much better. You\u0027ll\\n\\n understand when I show you. The moon looks so beautiful when you\u0027re a wolf.\"\\n\\n Oh,Godand so that was what he meant by pro tecting her, by making her understand. He meant\\n\\n changing her into something like him.\\n\\n I need a weapon.\\n\\n Rowan had said silver was harmful to werewolves,so the old silver-bullet legend must be true. But she\\n\\n didn\u0027t haveasilver bullet. Or even a silver dagger ...\\n\\n A silver dagger... a silverknife ...\\n\\n Behind Jeremy the station wagon was almost invisible in the clouds of smoke. And by now the smoke\\n\\n had the red glow of uncontrolled fire.\\n\\n It\u0027s too dangerous, Mary-Lynnette thought. It\u0027sabout to go. I\u0027d never make it in and out....\\n\\n Jeremy was still talking, his voice savage now.\"You won\u0027t miss the Night World. All their stupid\\n\\n restrictions-no killing humans, no hunting too often. Nobody tells me how to hunt. My uncle tried,but I\\n\\n took care of him-\"\\n\\n Suddenly the creature-it wasn\u0027t really a personanymore-broke off and turned sharply. Mary-Lynnette\\n\\n saw its lips go back again, saw its teeth parted and ready to bite. In the same instant she sawwhy-Ash\\n\\n was moving.\\n\\n Sitting up, even though his throat was cut. Lookingaround dazedly. He saw Mary-Lynnette, and his eyes\\n\\n seemed to focus. Then he looked at the thing Jeremy had become.\\n\\n \"You-get away from herl\" he shouted in a voiceMary-Lynnette had never heard before. A voice\\n\\n filledwith deadly fury. Mary-Lynnette could see himchange position in a swift, graceful motion, gathering\\n\\n his muscles under him to jump\\n\\n But the werewolf jumped first. Springing like ananimal-except that Jeremy still had arms, and onehand\\n\\n went for the yew club. The club smashed sideways into Ash\u0027s head and knocked him flat. And then it fell,\\n\\n bouncing away on the carpet of needles.\\n\\n The werewolf didn\u0027t need it-it was baring itsteeth. It was going to tear Ash\u0027s throat out, like the horse,\\n\\n like the hiker ...\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette was running.\\n\\n Not toward Ash. She couldn\u0027t help him barehanded. She ran toward the car, into the clouds of choking\\n\\n smoke.\\n\\n Oh, God, it\u0027s hot. Please let me just get there....\\n\\n She could feel the heat on her cheeks, on her arms. She remembered something from an elementary\\n\\n school safety class and dropped to her knees, scrambling and crawling where the air was cooler.\\n\\n And then she heard the sound behind her. The most eerie sound there is-a wolf howling.\\n\\n It knows what I\u0027m doing. It\u0027s seen that knife everytime I pry off my gas cap. It\u0027s going to stop me....\\n\\n She threw herself blindly into the smoke and heat,and reached the car. Orange flames were shooting\\n\\n crazily from the engine, and the door handle burnedher hand when she touched it. She fumbled,\\n\\n wrenching at it.\\n\\n Open,open...\\n\\n The door swung out. Hot air blasted around her. If she\u0027d been completely human she wouldn\u0027t havebeen\\n\\n able to stand it. But she\u0027d exchanged blood withfour vampires in two days, and she wasn\u0027t completely\\n\\n human anymore. She wasn\u0027t Mary-Lynnette any more ...but was she capable of killing?\\n\\n Flames were licking up beneath the dashboard. Shegroped over smoking vinyl and shoved a hand under\\n\\n the driver\u0027s seat.\\n\\n Find it! Find it!\\n\\n Her fingers touched metal-the knife. The silverfruit knife with the Victorian scrolling that she\u0027d borrowed\\n\\n from Mrs. Burdock. It was very hot. Her handdosed on it, and she pulled it from under the seatand\\n\\n turned ... just as something came flying at her from behind.\\n\\n The turning was instinctive-she had to face whatwas attacking her. But what she would always know\\n\\n afterward was that she could have turned withoutpointing theknife at what was attacking her. There was\\n\\n a moment in which she could have slanted it backward or toward the ground or toward herself. And if\\n\\n she\u0027d been the Mary-Lynnette of the old days,she might have done that.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t. The knife faced outward. Toward the shape jumping at her. And when the thing landed on\\n\\n top of her she felt impact in her wrist and all theway up her arm.\\n\\n The distant part of her mind said, It went in cleanlybetween the ribs....\\n\\n And then everything was very confused. Mary-Lynnette felt teeth in her hair, snapping for her neck. She\\n\\n felt claws scratching at her, leaving welts on her arms. The thing attacking her was hairy and heavy and it\\n\\n wasn\u0027t a person or even a half-person. It was a large, snarling wolf.\\n\\n She was still holding the knife, but it was hard to keep her grip on it. It jerked around, twisting her wrist\\n\\n in an impossible direction. It was buried in the wolf\u0027s chest.\\n\\n For just an instant, as the thing pulled away, she got a good look at it.\\n\\n A beautiful animal. Sleek and handsome, but withcrazy eyes. It was trying to kill her with its last panting\\n\\n breath.\\n\\n Oh, God, you hate me, don\u0027t you? I\u0027ve chosen Ashover you; I\u0027ve hurt you with silver. And now you\u0027re\\n\\n dying. You must feel so betrayed....\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette began to shake violently. She couldn\u0027t do this anymore. She let go of the knife and\\n\\n pushed and kicked at the wolf with her arms andlegs. Half scrambling and half scooting on her back, she\\n\\n managed to get a few feet away. The wolf stood silhouetted against a background of fire. She couldsee it\\n\\n gather itself for one last spring at her\\n\\n There was a very soft, contained poof. The entirecar lurched like something in agony-and then the\\n\\n fireball was everywhere.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette cringed against the ground, halfblinded, but she had to watch.\\n\\n So that\u0027s what it looks like. A car going up inflames. Not the kind of big explosion you hear in the\\n\\n movies. Justa poof. And then just the fire, going up and up.\\n\\n The heat drove her away, still crawling, but she couldn\u0027t stop looking. Orange flames. That was allher\\n\\n station wagon was now. Orange flames shooting every which way out of a metal skeleton on tires.\\n\\n The wolf didn\u0027t come out of the flames.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette sat up. Smoke was in her throat,and when she tried to yell \"Jeremyl\" it came out as a\\n\\n hoarse croak.\\n\\n The wolf still didn\u0027t come out. And no wonder, with a silver knife in its chest and fire all around it.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette sat, arms wrapped around herself,and watched the car bum.\\n\\n He would have killed me. Like any good hunter. I had to defend myself, I had to save Ash. And thegirls\\n\\n ... he would have killed all of them. And thenhe\u0027d have killed more people like that hiker.... He was crazy\\n\\n and completelyevil, because he\u0027d do anything to get what he wanted.\\n\\n And she\u0027d seen it from the beginning. Somethingunder that \"nice guy\" exterior-she\u0027d seen it over and\\n\\n over, but she\u0027d kept letting herself get convinced it wasn\u0027t there. She should have trusted her feelingsin the\\n\\n first place. When she\u0027d realized that she\u0027dsolved the mystery of Jeremy Lovett and that it wasn\u0027t a happy\\n\\n She was shaking but she couldn\u0027t cry.\\n\\n The fire roared on. Tiny sparks showered upward.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care if it was justified. It wasn\u0027t like killingin my dream. It wasn\u0027t easy and it wasn\u0027t naturaland I\u0027ll\\n\\n never forget the way he looked at me.... Then she thought,Ash.\\n\\n She\u0027d been so paralyzed she\u0027d almost forgotten him. Now she turned around, almost too frightened to\\n\\n look. She made herself crawl over to where he was still lying.\\n\\n So much blood... how can he be all right? But if he\u0027s dead ... if it\u0027s all been for nothing ...\\n\\n But Ash was breathing. And when she touched hisface, trying to find a clean place in the blood, he\\n\\n moved. He stirred, then he tried to sit up.\\n\\n \"Stay there.\" Jeremy\u0027s shirt and jeans were on the ground. Mary-Lynnette picked up the shirt and\\n\\n dabbed at Ash\u0027s neck. \"Ash, keep still....\"\\n\\n He tried to sit up again. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll protectyou.\"\\n\\n \"Lie down,\" Mary-Lynnette said. When he didn\u0027t, she pushed at him. \"There\u0027s nothing to do. He\u0027s\\n\\n dead.\"\\n\\n He sank back, eyes shutting. \"Did I kill him?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette made a choked sound that wasn\u0027t exactly a laugh. She was trembling with relief-Ash\\n\\n could breathe and talk, and he even sounded like hisnormal fatuous self. She\u0027d had no idea how good\\n\\n thatcould sound. And underneath the swabbing shirt she could see that his neck was already healing.\\n\\n Whathad been gashes were becoming flat pink scars.\\n\\n Vampire flesh was incredible.\\n\\n Ash swallowed. \"You didn\u0027t answer my question.\"\\n\\n \"No. You didn\u0027t kill him. I did.\"\\n\\n His eyes opened. They just looked at each other for a moment. And in that moment Mary-Lynnette\\n\\n knew they were both realizing a lot of things.\\n\\n Then Ash said, \"I\u0027m sorry,\" and his voice had never been less fatuous. He pushed the shirt awayand sat\\n\\n up. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know who reached first, but they were holding each other.
