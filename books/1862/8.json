There was nothing that way except two creeks andlots of trees. And her house. She hoped he was goingto try to walk into town, and that he didn\u0027t realize how far it was. All right, he\u0027s gone, now forget about him. You\u0027vegot a job to do, remember? A slightly dangerous one. And he\u0027s not involved. I don\u0027t believe he knows anything about what happened to Mrs. B. She got the shovel and started down the road west.As she walked she found that she was able to put Ash out of her mind completely. Because all she could think of was what was waiting ahead. I\u0027m not scared to do it; I\u0027m not scared, I\u0027m notscared.... OfcourseI\u0027m scared. But being scared was good, it would make her careful. She would do this job quickly and quietly. In through the gap in the hedge, a little fast work with the shovel, out again before anybody saw her. She tried not to picture what she was going to findwith that shovel if she was right. She approachedBurdock Farm cautiously, going north and then doubling back southeast to come in through the back property. The farmland had gone wild here, taken over by poison oak, beargrass, and dodder, besides the inevitable blackberry bushes and gorse. Tan oaks and chinquapins were moving in. Sometime soon these pastures would be forest. I\u0027m not sure I believe I\u0027m doing this, MaryLynnette thought as she reached the hedge that surrounded the garden. But the strange thing was that she didbelieve it. She was going to vandalize a neighbor\u0027s property and probably look at a dead bodyand she was surprisingly cool about it. Scared but not panicked. Maybe there was more hidden inside her than she realized. I may not be who I\u0027ve always thought I am. The garden was dark and fragrant. It wasn\u0027t theirises and daffodils Mrs. B. had planted; it wasn\u0027t the fireweed and bleeding heart that were growing wild. It was the goats. Mary-Lynnette stuck to the perimeter of the hedge,eyes on the tall, upright silhouette of the farmhouse. There were only two windows lit. Please don\u0027t let them see me and please don\u0027t letme make a noise. Still looking at the house, she walked slowly, taking careful baby steps to the place where the earth was disturbed. The first couple of swipes with the shovel hardly moved the soil. Okay. Put a little conviction in it. And don\u0027t watch the house; there\u0027s no point. If they look out, they\u0027re going to see you, and there\u0027s nothing you can do about it. Just as she put her foot on the shovel, somethingwent hooshin the rhododendrons behind her. Crouched over her shovel,Mary-Lynnette froze. Stop worrying, she told herself. That\u0027s not the sisters. It\u0027s not Ash coming back. That\u0027s an animal. She listened. A mournful maaaa came from the goat shed. It wasn\u0027t anything. It was a rabbit. Dig! She got out a spadeful of dirt-and then she heardit again. Hoosh. A snuffling sound. Then a rustling. Definitely an animal. But if it was a rabbit, it was an awfully loud one. Who cares what it is? Mary-Lynnette told herself.There aren\u0027t any dangerous animalsout here. And I\u0027m not afraid of the dark. It\u0027s my natural habitat. I love the night. But tonight, somehow, she felt differently. Maybe it was just the scene with Ash that had shaken her, made her feel confused and discontented. But just now she felt almost as if something was trying to tell her that the dark wasn\u0027t any human\u0027s natural habitat. That she wasn\u0027t built for it, with her weak eyes and her insensitive ears and dull nose. That she didn\u0027t belong. Hoosh. I may have rotten hearing, but I can hearthatjustfine. And it\u0027s big. Something big\u0027s sniffing around in What kind of big animal could be out here? Itwasn\u0027t a deer deer went snort-wheeze. It sounded larger than a coyote, taller. A bear? Then she heard a different sound the vigorousshaking of dry, leathery rhododendron leaves. In the dim light from the house she couldseethe branches churning as something tried to emerge. it\u0027s coming out. Mary-Lynnette clutched her shovel and ran. Nottoward the gap in the hedge, not toward the housethey were both too dangerous. She ran to the goat shed. I can defend myself in here-keep it out---hit itwith the shovel.... The problem was that she couldn\u0027t see from in here.There were two windows in the shed, but between dirt on the glass and the darkness outside, Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t make out anything. She couldn\u0027teven see the goats, although she could hear them. Don\u0027t turn on the penlight. It\u0027ll just give awayyour position. Holding absolutely still, she strained tohear any thing from outside. Nothing. Her nostrils were full of goat. The layers of oat straw and decomposing droppings on the floor were smelly, and they kept the shed too warm. Her palms were sweating as she gripped the shovel. I\u0027ve never hit anybody ... not since Mark and Iwere kids fighting ... but, heck, I kicked a strangerthis morning... . She hoped the potential for violence would comeout now when she needed it. A goat nudged her shoulder.Mary-Lynnette shrugged it away. The other goat bleated suddenlyand she bit her lip. Oh, God-I heard something out there. The goatheard it, too. She could taste her bitten lip. It was like sucking on a penny. Blood tasted like copper, which, she realizedsuddenly, tasted like fear. Something opened the shed door. What happened then was that Mary-Lynnette Something unholy was after her. Something thatsniffed like an animal but could open doors like ahuman. She couldn\u0027t see what it was-just a shadowdarkness against darkness. She didn\u0027t think ofturning on the penlight-her only impulse was to smash out with the shovel now, to get ft before ft could get her. She was tingling with the instinct forpure, primordial violence. Instead, she managed to hiss, \"Who is ft? Who\u0027sthere?\" A familiar voice said,\"Iknew you were going to do this. I\u0027ve been lookingeverywherefor you.\" \"Oh,God, Mark.\" Mary-Lynnette sagged against wall of the shed, letting go of the shovel. The goats were both bleating. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s earswere ringing. Mark shuffled farther in. \"Jeez, this place smells. What are you doing inhere?\" \"Youjerk,\"Mary-Lynnette said. \"I almost brained you!\" 0\"You said you were forgetting all this crazy stuff. You lied to me.\" \"Mark, you don\u0027t ...We can talk later.... Did you hearanything out there?\" She was trying to gather her thoughts. \"Like what?\" He was so calm. It made MaryLynnette feel vaguely foolish. Then his voice sharpened. \"Like a yowling?\" \"No. Like a snuffling.\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s breath was slowing. \"I didn\u0027t hear anything. We\u0027d better get out ofhere. What are we supposed to say if Jade comes out?\" Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know how to answer that. Mark was in a different world, a happy, shiny world where the worst that could happen tonight was embarrassment. Finally she said \"Mark, listen to me. I\u0027m your sister. I don\u0027t have any reason to lie to you, or playtricks on you, or put down somebody you like. AndI don\u0027t just jump to conclusions; I don\u0027t imagine things. But I\u0027m telling you, absolutely seriously,that there is something weird going on with these girls.\" Mark opened his mouth, but she went on relentlessly. \"So now there are only two things you can believe, and one is that I\u0027m completely out of mymind, and the other is that it\u0027s true. Do you really think I\u0027m crazy?\" She was thinking of the past as she said it, of allthe nights they\u0027d held on to each other when their mother wassick, of the books she\u0027d read out loud tohim, of the times she\u0027d put Band-Aids on his scrapes and extra cookies in his lunch. And somehow, even though it was dark, she could sense that Mark was remembering, too. They\u0027d shared so much. They would always be connected. Finally Mark said quietly, \"You\u0027re not crazy.\" \"Thank you.\" \"But I don\u0027t know what to think. Jade wouldn\u0027t hurtanybody. I justknow that. And since I met her , .\"Hepaused. \"Mare, it\u0027s like now I know why I\u0027m alive.She\u0027s different from any girl I\u0027ve ever known. She\u0027s ____ she\u0027s so brave, and so funny, and so ... herself.\" And I thought it was the blond hair, MaryLynnette thought. Shows how shallow I am. She was moved and surprised by the change in Mark-but mostly she was frightened. Frightenedsick. Her cranky, cynical brother had found somebody to care about at last ... and the girl was probably descended from Lucrezia Borgia. And now, even though she couldn\u0027t see him, shecould hear earnest appeal in his voice. \"Mare, can\u0027t we just go home?\" Mary-Lynnette felt sicker. She broke off and they both snapped their heads to look at the shed window. Outside a light had gone \"Shut the door,\" Mary-Lynnette hissed, in a tone that made Mark dose the door to the shed instantly. \"And be quiet,- she added, grabbing his arm and pulling him next to the wall. She looked cautiously out the window. Rowan came out of the back door first, followedbyjade,followed by Kestrel. Kestrel had a shovel. Oh. My. God. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Mark said, trying to get alook. Mary-Lynnette damped a hand over his mouth.What was happening was that the girls were digging up the garden again. She didn\u0027t see anything wrapped in garbage bags this time. So what were they doing? Destroying the evidence? Were they going to take it into the houseand burn it, chop it up? Her heart was pounding madly. Mark had scooted up and was looking out. MaryLynnette heard him take a breath-and then choke. Maybe he was trying to think of an innocent explanation for this. She squeezed his shoulder. They both watched as the girls took turns with theshovel. Mary-Lynnette was impressed all over againat how strong they were. Jade looked so fragile. Every time one of the sisters glanced around the garden, Mary-Lynnette\u0027s heart skipped a beat. Don\u0027t see us, don\u0027t hear us, don\u0027t catch us, she thought. When a respectable mound of dirt had piled up, Rowan and Kestrel reached into the hole. They lifted out the long garbage-bagged bundle Mary-Lynnettehad seen before. It seemed to be stiff-and surpris ingly light. For the first time, Mary-Lynnette wondered if it was too light to be a body. Or too stiff ... how longdid rigor mortis last? Mark\u0027s breathing was irregular, almost wheezing.The girls were carrying the bundle to the gap inthe Mark cursed. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s brain was racing. She hissed,\"Mark, stay here. I\u0027m going to follow them-\" \"I\u0027m going with you!\" \"You have to tell Dad if anything happens to me-\" \"I\u0027m going withyou.\" There wasn\u0027t time to argue. And something inside Mary-Lynnette was glad to have Mark\u0027s strength to back her. She gasped, \"Come on, then. And don\u0027t make asound.\" She was worried they might have already lost the sisters--it was such a dark night. But when she and Mark squeezed through the gap in the rhododendron bushes, she saw a light ahead. A tiny, bobbing white light. The sisters were using a flashlight. Keep quiet, move carefully. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027tdare say it out loud to Mark, but she kept thinking it over and over, like a mantra. Her whole consciousness was fixed on the little shaft of light that was leading them, like a comet\u0027s tail in the darkness. The light took them south, into a stand of Douglasfir. It wasn\u0027t long before they were walking into forest. Where are they going? Mary-Lynnette thought. She could feel fine tremors in her muscles as she tried to move as quickly as possible without making a sound. They were lucky--the floor of this forest was carpeted with needles from Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine. The needles were fragrant and slightly damp and they muffled footsteps. Mary-Lynnette could hardly hear Mark walking behind her except when he hurt himself. They went on for what seemed like forever. It was pitch dark and Mary-Lynnette very quickly lost any sense of where they were. Or how they were going to get back. Oh, God, I was crazy to do this-and to bring Markalong, too. We\u0027re out in the middle of the woodswith three crazy girls.... The light had stopped. Mary-Lynnette stopped, holding out an arm thatMark immediately ran into. She was staring at thelight, trying to make sure it really wasn\u0027t moving away. No. It was steady. It was pointed at the ground. \"Let\u0027s get loser,\" Mark whispered, putting his lips against Mary-Lynnette\u0027s ear. She nodded and began to creep toward the light, as slowly and silently asshe knew how. Every few steps she paused and stood absolutely still, waiting to see if the light was going to turn her way. It didn\u0027t. She got down and crawled the last ten feet to the edge of the clearing where the girls had stopped. Once there, she had a good view of what they were doing. Digging. Kestrel had shoveled the pine needles aside and was working on a hole. Mary-Lynnette felt Mark crawl up beside her,crushing sword fern and woodfem. She could feel his chest heaving. She knew he saw what she saw. I\u0027m so sorry. Oh, Mark, I\u0027m so sorry. There was no way to deny it now. Mary-Lynnetteknew. She didn\u0027t even need to look in the bag. How am I going to find this place again? When I bring the sheriff back, how am I going to remember it? It\u0027s like a maze in one of those computer fantasy games-Mixed Evergreen Forest in every direction,and nothing to distinguish any bit of it from any other bit. She chewed her lip. The bed of moist needles she was lying on was soft and springy-actually comfortable. They could wait here for a long time, until the sisters left, and then mark the trees somehow. Takephotographs. Tie their socks to branches. In the clearing the flashlight beam showed a hand putting down the shovel. Then Rowan and Kestrellifted the garbage-bagged bundle-Jade must beholding the flashlight, Mary-Lynnette thought-and lowered it into the hole. Good. Now cover it up and leave. The beam showed Rowan bending to pick up the shovel again. She began quickly covering the hole with dirt. Mary-Lynnette was happy. Over soon, she thought, and let out a soft breath of relief. And in that instant everything in the clearingchanged. The flashlight beam swung wildly. Mary-Lynnette flattened herself, feeling her eyes widen. She could see a silhouette against the light-golden hair haloed around the face. Kestrel. Kestrel was standing, facing Mark and Mary-Lynnette, her body tense and still. Listening. Listening. Mary-Lynnette lay absolutely motionless, mouthopen, trying to breathe without making a soundThere were things crawling in the soft, springy needlebed under her. Centipedes and millipedes. She didn\u0027tdare move even when she felt something tickle acrossher back under her shirt. Her own ears rang from listening. But the forest was silent ... eerily dent. All Mary-Lynnette couldhear was her own heart pounding wildly in herchest-although ft felt as if it were in her throat, too.It made her head bob with its rhythm. She was afraid. And it wasn\u0027t just fear. It was something shecouldn\u0027t remember experiencing since she was nineor ten. Ghost fear. The fear of something you\u0027re not even sure exists. Somehow, watching Kestrel\u0027s silhouette In the dark woods, Mary-Lynnette was afraid of monsters.She had aterrible,terrible feeling. Oh, please--I shouldn\u0027t have brought Mark here. It was then that she realized that Mark\u0027s breathing was making a noise. Just a faint sound, not a whistling, more like a cat purring. It was the sound he\u0027d made as a kid when his lungs were bad. Kestrel stiffened, her head turning, as if to locate a noise. Oh, Mark, no. Don\u0027t breathe. Hold your breath-Everything happened very fast. Kestrel sprang forward. Mary-Lynnette saw her silhouette come running and jumping with unbelievable speed. Toofast-nobody moves thatfast .. . nobody human.... What are these girls? Her vision came in flashes,as if she were under a strobe light. Kestrel jumping. Dark trees all around. A moth caught in the beam. Kestrel coming down. Protect mark... A deer. Kestrel was coming down on a deer. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind was filled with jumbled, careening images. Images that didn\u0027t make sense. She had a wild thought that it wasn\u0027t Kestrel at all, but one of those raptor dinosaurs she\u0027d seen at the movies. Because Kestrel moved like that. Or maybe ftwasn\u0027t a deer-but Mary-Lynnette could seethe white at its throat, as pure as a lace ruffle at the throat of a young girl. She could see itsliquid black eyes. The deer screamed. Disbelief. I can\u0027t be seeing this.... The deer was on the ground, delicate legs thrashing. And Kestrel was tangled with it. Her face buriedin the white of its throat. Her arms around it. The deer screamed again. Wrenched violently.Seemed to be having convulsions. The flashlight beam was all over the place. Then it dropped. At the very edge of the light, Mary-Lynnette could see two other figures join Kestrel.They were all holding the deer. There was one last spasm and it stopped fighting. Everything went still. Mary-Lynnette could see Jade\u0027s hair, so fine that individual strands caught the light against the background of darkness. In the silent Bearing the three figures cradled thedeer. Huddling over it. Shoulders moving rhythmically. Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t see exactly what theywere doing, but the general scene wasf,miliar.She\u0027d seen it on dozens of nature documentaries. About wild dogs or lionesses or wolves. The pack hadhunted and now ft wasfeeding. I have always tried... to bea very good observer. And now, I have to believe my own eyes... . Beside her, Mark\u0027s breath wassobbing. Oh, God, let me get him out of here. Please justlet us get out. It was as if she\u0027d been suddenly released from paralysis. Her lip was bleeding again-she must havebitten down on it while she was watchingthe deer.Copperbloodfear filled her mouth. \"Come on,\" shegasped almost soundlessly, wiggling backward. Twigs and needles raked her stomachas her T-shirt rode up. She grabbed Mark\u0027s arm.\"Come onl\" Instead, Mark lurched to his feet. \"Mark!\" She wrenched herself to her knees andtried to drag him down. He pulled away. Hetook a step toward theclearing. No \"Jade!\" He was heading for the clearing. No, Mary-Lynnette thought again, andthen shewas moving after him. They were caught now, andit really didn\u0027t matter what he did. Butshe wantedto bewith him. \"Jade!\" Mark said and he grabbed the flashlight.He turned it directly on the little huddle at the edgeof the clearing. Three faces turned toward him. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind reeled. It was one thing toguess what the girls were doing; it was another thingto seeit. Those three beautiful faces, white in the flashlight beam ...with what looked like smearedlipstick on their mouths and chins. Cardinal red, thimbleberry color. But it wasn\u0027t lipstick or burst thimbleberries. It wasblood, and the deer\u0027s white neck was stained with it. Eating the deer, they\u0027re really eating the deer;oh, God, they\u0027re really doing it.... Some part of her mind-the part that had absorbedhorror movies-expected the three girls to hiss and cringe away from the light. To block it out with bloodstained hands while making savage faces. It didn\u0027t happen. There were no animal noises, nodemon voices, no contortions. Instead, as Mary-Lynnette stood frozen in an agonyof horror, and Mark stood trying to get a normal breath, Jade straightened up. And said, \"What are you guys doing out here?\" In a puzzled, vaguely annoyed voice. The way youwould speak to some boy who keeps following you everywhere and asking you for a date. Mary-Lynnette felt her mind spinning off. There was a long silence. Then Rowan and Kestrelstood up. Mark was breathing heavily, moving the flashlight from one of the girls to another, but always coming back to Jade. \"What areyoudoing out here; that\u0027s the question!\" he said raggedly. The flashlight whipped to the hole, then back tothe girls. \"What are you doing?\" \"I asked you first,\" Jade said, frowning. If ft hadJust been her, Mary-Lynnette would have started towonder if things were so awful after all. if maybethey weren\u0027t in terrible danger. But Rowan and Kestrel were looking at each other,and then at Mark and Mary-Lynnette. And their ex pressions made Mary-Lynnette\u0027s throat close. \"You shouldn\u0027t have followed us,\" Rowan said.She looked grave and sad. \"They shouldn\u0027t have beenableto,\" Kestrel said.She looked grim. \"It\u0027s because they smell like goats,\" Jade said. \"What are you doing?\"Mark shouted again, almostsobbing. Mary-Lynnette wanted to reach for him, butshe couldn\u0027t move. Jade wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.\"Well, can\u0027t youtell?\"She turned to her sisters.\"Now what are we supposed todo?\" There was a silence. Then Kestrel said, \"We don\u0027thave a choice. We havetokill them.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-8.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
