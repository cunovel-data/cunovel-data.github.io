{"id":82069,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"What a difference a day made. Somehow, in the hot, hazy August sunlight the -next morning, Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t get serious about checking on whether Mrs. Burdock was dead. It was just too ridiculous. Besides, she had a lot to do-school started in just over two weeks. At the beginning of June she had been sure summer would last forever, sure that she would neversay, \"Wow, this summer has gone by so fast.\" And now here she stood in mid-August, and she was saying, \"Wow, it\u0027s gone by so fast.\" I need clothes, Mary-Lynnette thought. And a new backpack, and notebooks, and some of those little purple felt-tip pens. And I need to make Mark get all those things, too, because he won\u0027t do it by himself and Claudine will never make him. Claudine was their stepmother. She was Belgian and very pretty, with curly dark hair and sparklingdark eyes. She was only ten years older than MaryLynnette, and she looked even younger. She\u0027d been the family\u0027s housecleaning helper when Mary Lynnette\u0027s mom first got sick five years ago. MaryLynnette liked her, but she was hopeless as a substitute mother, and Mary-Lynnette usually ended up taking charge of Mark. So I don\u0027t have time to go over to Mrs. B.\u0027s. She spent the day shopping. It wasn\u0027t until after dinner that she thought about Mrs. Burdock again. She was helping to dear dishes out of the family room, where dinner was traditionally eaten in front of the TV, when her father said, \"I heard something today about Todd Akers and Vic Kimble.\" \"Those losers,\" Mark muttered. Mary-Lynnette said, \"What?\" \"They had some kind of accident over on Chiloquin Road-over between Hazel Green Creek and Beavercreek.\" \"A car accident?\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Well, this is the thing,\" her father said. \"Apparently there wasn\u0027t any damage to their car, but they both thought they\u0027d been in an accident. They showed up at home after midnight and said that something had happened to them out there-but they didn\u0027tknow what. They were missing a few hours.\" He looked at Mark and Mary-Lynnette. \"How about that, guys?\" \"It\u0027s the UFOs!\" Mark shouted immediately, dropping into discus-throwing position and wiggling his plate. \"UFOs are a crock,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Do youknow how far the little green men would have to travel-and there\u0027s no suchthing as warp speed. Whydo people have to make things up when the universe is just just blazing with incredible things that are real-\"She stopped. Her family was looking at her oddly. \"Actually Todd and Vic probably just got smashed,\" she said, and put her plate and glass in the sink. Her father grimaced slightly. Claudine pursed her lips. Mark grinned. \"In a very real and literal sense,\" he said. \"We hope.\" It was as Mary-Lynnette was walking back to the family room that a thought struck her. Chiloquin Road was right off Kahneta, the road her own house was on. The road Mrs. B.\u0027s house was on.It was only two miles from Burdock Farm to Chiloquin. There couldn\u0027t be any connection. Unless the girls were burying the little green man who\u0027d abductedVic and Todd. But it bothered her. Two really strange things happening in the same night, in the same area. In a tiny, sleepy area that never saw any kind of excitement. I know, I\u0027ll call Mrs. B. And she\u0027ll be fine, and that\u0027ll prove everything\u0027s okay, and I\u0027ll be able to laugh about all this. But nobody answered at the Burdock house. The phone rang and rang. Nobody picked it up and the answering machine never came on. Mary-Lynnettehung up feeling grim but oddly calm. She knew what she had to do now. She snagged Mark as he was going up the stairs. \"I need to talk to you.\" \"Look, if this is about your Walkman-\" \"Huh? It\u0027s about something we have to do tonight.\" Mary-Lynnette looked at him. \"What aboutmy Walkman?\" \"Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.\" Mary-Lynnette groaned but let it go. \"Listen, Ineed you to help me out. Last night I saw something weird when I was on the hill....\" She explained as succinctly as possible. \"And now more weird stuff with Todd and Vic,\" she said. Mark was shaking his head, looking at her in something like pity. \"Mare, Mare,\" he said kindly. \"You really are crazy, you know.\" \"Yes,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m still going over there tonight.\" \"To do what?\" \"To check things out. I just want toseeMrs. B. If I can talk to her, I\u0027ll feel better. And if I can find out what\u0027s buried in that garden, I\u0027ll feel a wholelotbetter.\" \"Maybe they were burying Sasquatch. That government study in the Klamaths never did find him, you know.\" \"Mark, you owe me for the Walkman. For whatever happened to the Walkman.\" \"Uh...\" Mark sighed, then muttered resignedly.\"Okay, I owe you. But I\u0027m telling you right now, I\u0027m not going to talk to those girls.\" \"You don\u0027t have to talk to them. You don\u0027t evenhave to see them. There\u0027s something else I want youto do.\" The sun was just setting. They\u0027d walked this roada hundred times to get to Mary-Lynnette\u0027s hill-the only difference tonight was that Mark was carryinga pair of pruning shears and Mary-Lynnette had pulled the Rubylith filter off her flashlight. \"You don\u0027t reallythink they offed the old lady.\" \"No,\" Mary-Lynnette said candidly. \"I just want to put the world back where it belongs.\" \"You want what?\" \"You know how you have a view of the way theworld is, but every so often you wonder, \u0027Oh, myGod, what if it\u0027s really different?\u0027Like, \u0027What if I\u0027m really adopted and the people I think are my parentsaren\u0027t my parents at all?\u0027 And if it were true, it would change everything, and for a minute you don\u0027t know what\u0027s real. Well, that\u0027s how I feel right now, and I want to get rid of it. I want my old world back.\" \"You know what\u0027s scary?\" Mark said. \"I think Iunderstand.\" By the time they got to Burdock Farm, it was full dark. Ahead of them, in the west, the star Arcturus seemed to hang over the farmhouse, glittering faintly red. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t bother trying to deal withthe rickety gate. She went to the place behind the blackberry bushes where the picket fence had fallen flat. The farmhouse was like her own family\u0027s, but with lots of Victorian-style gingerbread added. MaryLynnette thought the spindles and scallops and fretwork gave it a whimsical air-eccentric, like Mrs. Burdock. Just now, as she was looking at one of the second-story windows, the shadow of a moving figure fell on the roller blind. Good, Mary-Lynnette thought. At least I know somebody\u0027s home. Mark began hanging back as they walked down the weedy path to the house. \"You said I could hide.\" \"Okay. Right. Look, why don\u0027t you take thoseshears and sort of go around back-\" \"And look at the Sasquatch grave while I\u0027m there? Maybe do a little digging? I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Fine,\" Mary-Lynnette said calmly. \"Then hidesomewhere out here and hope they don\u0027t see you when they come to the door. At least with the shears you have an excuse to be in the back.\" Mark threw her a bitter glance and she knew she\u0027dwon. As he started off, Mary-Lynnette said suddenly, \"Mark, be careful.\" Mark just waved a dismissive hand at her without turning around. When he was out of sight, Mary-Lynnette knockedon the front door. Then she rang the doorbellitwasn\u0027t a button but an actual bellpull. She could hear chimes inside, but nobody answered. She knocked and rang with greater authority. Every minute she kept expecting the door to open to reveal Mrs. B., petite, gravelly-voiced, blue-haired,dressed in an old cotton housedress. But it didn\u0027t happen. Nobody came. Mary-Lynnette stopped being polite and began knocking with one hand and ringing with the other. It was somewhere in the middle of this frenzy ofknocks and rings that she realized she was frightened. Really frightened. Her world view was wobbling.Mrs. Burdock hardly ever left the house. She always answered the door. And Mary-Lynnette had seenwith her own eyes that somebody was home here. So why weren\u0027t they answering? Mary-Lynnette\u0027s heart was beating very hard. She had an uncomfortable falling sensation in her stomach. I should get out of here and call Sheriff Akers. It\u0027s his job to know what to do about things like this.But it was hard to work up any feeling of confidence in Todd\u0027s father. She took her alarm and frustration out on the door. Which opened. Suddenly. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s fist hit air and for an instant she felt sheer panic, fear of the unknown. \"What can I do for you?\" The voice was soft and beautifully modulated. Thegirl was just plain beautiful. What Mary-Lynnette hadn\u0027t been able to see from the top of her hill was that the brown hair was aglow with rich chestnut highlights, the features were classically molded, the tall figure was graceful and willowy. \"You\u0027re Rowan,\" she said. \"How did you know?\" You couldn\u0027t be anything else; I\u0027ve never seen anybody who looked so much like �� tree spirit. \"Your aunt told me about you. I\u0027m Mary-Lynnette Carter, Ilive just up Kahneta Road. You probably saw my house on your way here.\" Rowan looked noncommittal. She had such a sweet,grave face-,and skin that looked like white orchid petals, Mary-Lynnette thought abstractedly. She said, \"So, I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood, say hello, see if there\u0027s anything you need.\" Rowan looked less grave; she almost smiled and her brown eyes grew warm. \"How nice of you. Really. I almost wish we did need something ... but actually we\u0027re fine.\" Mary-Lynnette realized that, with the utmost civility and good manners, Rowan was winding up the conversation. Hastily she threw a new subject into the pool. \"There are three of you girls, right? Are you going to school here?\" \"My sisters are.\" \"That\u0027s great. I can help show them around. I\u0027ll be a senior this year.\" Another subject, quick, MaryLynnette thought. \"So, how do you like Briar Creek? It\u0027s probably quieter than you\u0027re used to.\" \"Oh, it was pretty quiet where we came from,\"Rowan said. \"But we love it here; it\u0027s such a wonderful place. The trees, the little animals. . .\" She broke off. \"Yeah, those cute little animals,\" Mary-Lynnette said. Get to the point, her inner voices were telling her. Her tongue and the roof of her mouth felt like Velcro. Finally she blurted, \"So-so, um, how is your aunt right now?\" \"She\u0027s-fine.\" That instant\u0027s hesitation was all Mary-Lynnette needed. Her old suspicions, her old panic, surged up immediately. Making her feel bright and cold, like aknife made of ice. She found herself saying in a confident, almost chirpy voice, \"Well, could I just talk to her for a minute? Would you mind? It\u0027s just that I have something sort of important to tellher....\" She made a move as if to step over the threshold. Rowan kept on blocking the door. \"Oh, I\u0027m sosorry. Butwell, that\u0027s not really possible rightnow.\" \"Oh, is it one of her headaches? I\u0027ve seen her in bed before.\" Mary-Lynnette gave a little tinkly \"No, it\u0027s not a headache.\" Rowan spoke gently, deliberately. \"The truth is that she\u0027s gone for a few days.\" \"Gone?\" \"I know.\" Rowan made a little grimace acknowledging that this was odd. \"She just decided to take a few days off. A little vacation.\" \"But-gosh, with you girls just getting here...\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s voice was brittle. \"Well, you see, she knew we\u0027d take care of thehouse for her. That\u0027s why she waited until we came.\" \"But-gosh,\" Mary-Lynnette said again. She felt aspasm in her throat. \"Where-just where did she go?\" \"Up north, somewhere on the coast. I\u0027m not sure of the name of the town.\" \"But . . .\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s voice trailed off. Back off, her inner voices warned.Now was the time to be polite, to be cautious. Pushing it meant showing this girl that Mary-Lynnette knew something was wrong with this story. And since somethingwas wrong, thisgirl might be dangerous.... It was hard to believe that while looking at Rowan\u0027ssweet, grave face. She didn\u0027t look dangerous. But thenMary-Lynnette noticed something else. Rowan was barefoot. Her feet were as creamy-pale as the rest ofher, but sinewy. Something about them, the way they were placed or the clean definition of the toes, made Mary-Lynnette think of those feet running. Of savage, primal speed. When she looked up, there was another girl walking up behind Rowan. The one with dark golden hair. Her skin was milky instead of blossomy, and her eyes were yellow. \"This is Kestrel,\" Rowan said. \"Yes,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She realized she was staring. And realized, the moment after that, that shewas scared. Everything about Kestrel made her thinkof savage, primal movement. The girl walked as if she were flying. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Kestrel said. \"This is Mary-Lynnette,\" Rowan said, her, voice still pleasant. \"She lives down the road. She came to see Aunt Opal.\" \"Really just to see if you needed anything,\" MaryLynnette interjected quickly. \"We\u0027re sort of your only neighbors.\" Strategy change, she was thinking. About-face. Looking at Kestrel, she believed in danger. Now all she wanted was to keep these girls from guessing what she knew. \"You\u0027re a friend of Aunt Opal\u0027s?\" Kestrel asked silkily. Her yellow eyes swept Mary-Lynnette, first up, then down. \"Yeah, I come over sometimes, help her withthe\"-oh, God, don\u0027t say gardening-\"goats. Um, I guess she told you that they need to be milked everytwelve hours.\" Rowan\u0027s expression changed fractionally. MaryLynnette\u0027s heart gave a violent thud. Mrs. B. would never,everleave without giving instructions aboutthe goats. \"Of course she told us,\" Rowan said smoothly, justan instant too late. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s palms were sweating. Kestrelhadn\u0027t taken that keen, dispassionate, unblinkinggaze off her for a moment. Like the proverbial birdof prey staring down the proverbial rabbit. \"Well, it\u0027sgetting late and I bet you guys have things to do. I should let you go.\" Rowan and Kestrel looked at each other. Then theyboth looked at Mary-Lynnette, cinnamon-brown eyes and golden eyes fixed intently on her face.Mary-Lynnette had the falling feeling in her stomach again. \"Oh, don\u0027t goyet,\" Kestrel said silkily. \"Why don\u0027tyou come inside?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-4.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
