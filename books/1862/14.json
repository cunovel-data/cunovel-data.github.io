{"id":82078,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"They walked back to the gas station quickly, their shoulders almost touching. Mary-Lynnette found\n comfort in Rowan\u0027s nearness, in her levelheadedness.She\u0027d never had a friend before who was\n completelyher equal, who found it as easy to take care of people as to be taken care of.\n As they reached the gas station, they could see thatthe little group was now clustered around Mary\n Lynnette\u0027s car. Jeremy was peering under the hood.Mark and Jade were back, hand in hand, but there\n was no sign of Tiggy. Kestrel was leaning against a gas pump, and Ash was talking to Jeremy.\n \"So the werewolf walks into the second doctor\u0027s office and he says, \u0027Doc, I think I have rabies.\u0027\n And the doctor says ...\"\n So much for bluffing him, Mary-Lynnette thought.\n Rowan, eyes shut and shoulders tensed, said, \"Ash,that isn\u0027t funny.\" She opened her eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\"\n she said to Jeremy. \"He doesn\u0027t mean it.\"\n \"He does, but it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ve heard worse.\" Jeremy bent over the engine again. He\n replaced a cap with careful, even twists. Then he looked up at Mary-Lynnette.\n Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know what to say. What\u0027s the etiquette when you\u0027ve just discovered that\n somebody\u0027s a werewolf? And that it may be their duty to eat you?\n Her eyes filled. She was completely out of control today.\n Jeremy looked away. He shook his head slightly. His mouth was bitter. \"That\u0027s what I figured. I thought\n you\u0027d react this way. Or I\u0027d have told you myself a long time ago.\"\n \"You would?\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s vision cleared.\"But-then you would have gotten in trouble.\n Right?\"\n Jeremy smiled faintly. \"Well, we\u0027re not really sticklers for Night World law around here.\"\n He said it in a normal tone of voice. Ash and the sisters looked around reflexively.\n Mary-Lynnette said, \"\u0027We\u0027?\"\n \"My family. They first settled here because it was so far out of the way. A place where they\n wouldn\u0027t bother anybody, and nobody would bother them. Of course, they\u0027re all gone now. There\u0027s only\n me left.\"\n He said it without self-pity, but Mary-Lynnette moved closer. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Jade moved in on the other side, silvery-green eyeswide. \"But that\u0027s why we came here, too! So nobody\n would bother us. We don\u0027t like the Night World,either.\"\n Jeremy gave another faint smile-that smile thatshowed mostly in his eyes. \"I know,\" he said to Jade.\n \"You\u0027re related to Mrs. Burdock, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"She was our aunt,\" Kestrel said, her golden gaze fixed unwaveringly on him.\n Jeremy\u0027s expression changed slightly. He turned around to look at Kestrel directly. \"\u0027Was\u0027?\"\n \"Yes, shemet with a slight accident involving astake,\" Ash said. \"Funny how that happens some\n times....\"\n Jeremy\u0027s expression changed again. He looked as if he were leaning against the car for support. \"Who\n did it?\" Then he glanced back at Ash, and Mary-Lynnette saw a gleam of teeth. \"Wait you think I did.\n Don\u0027t you?\"\n \"It did cross our minds at one point,\" Ash said. \"Actually, it seemed to keep crossing them. Back\n and forth. Maybe we should put in a crosswalk.\"\n Mary-Lynnette said, \"Ash, stop it.\"\n \"So you\u0027re saying you didn\u0027t do it,\" Mark said to Jeremy, at the same time as Rowan said,\n \"Actually, Kestrel thinks it was a vampire hunter.\"\n Her voice was soft, but once again, everybody looked around. The street was still deserted.\n \"There\u0027s no vampire hunter around here,\" Jeremy said flatly.\n \"Then there\u0027s a vampire,\" Jade said in an excited whisper. \"There has to be, because of the way\n Aunt Opal was killed. And the goat.\"\n \"The goat . . . ? No, don\u0027t even tell me. I don\u0027t wanttoknow.\" Jeremy swung Mary-Lynnette\u0027s\n hood shut. He looked at her and said quickly, \"Everything\u0027s fine in there. You should get the oilchanged\n sometime.\" Then he turned to Rowan. \"I\u0027m sorry about your aunt. But if thereis a vampirearound here, it\u0027s\n somebody staying hidden. Really hidden. Same if it\u0027s a vampire hunter.\"\n \"We already figured that out,\" Kestrel said. MaryLynnette expected Ash to chime in, but Ash\n was staring across the street broodingly, his hands in hispockets, apparently having given up on the\n conversation for the moment.\n \"You haven\u0027t seen anything that could give you a due?\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"We were going to\n lookaround town.\"\n He met her eyes directly. \"If I knew, I\u0027d tell you.\" There was just the slightest emphasis on the last word.\n \"If I could help you, I would.\"\n \"Well, come along for the ride. You can put your head out of the window,\" Ash said, returning to\n life.\n That did it. Mary-Lynnette marched over, grabbedhim by the arm, and said to the others, \"Excuse us.\"\n She hauled him in a series of tugs to the back of the gas station. \"You jerk!\"\n \"Oh, look...................\n \"Shut upl\"She jabbed a finger at his throat. It didn\u0027t matter that touching him set off electrical explosions.\n It just gave her another reason to want to kill him. She found that the pink haze was a lot like anger when\n you kept shouting through it.\n \"You have to be the center of every drama, don\u0027t you? You have to be the center of attention,\n and act smart, and mouth off l\"\n \"Ow,\" Ash said.\n \"Even if it means hurting other people. Even if itmeans hurting somebody who\u0027s only had rotten\n breaks all his life. Well, not this time.\"\n \"Ow\n \"Rowan said you guys think all werewolves are low class. And you know what that is? Where I come\n from, they call that prejudice. And humans have it, too, andit is not a pretty picture. It\u0027s about the most\n hateful thing in the world. I\u0027m ashamed to even stand there while you spout it off.\" Mary-Lynnette realized\n she was crying. She also realized that Mark and Jade were peering around the edge of the gas station.\n Ash was flat against the boarded-up window, armsup in a gesture of surrender. He looked at a loss for\n words and ashamed. Good, Mary-Lynnette thought.\n \"Should you keep poking him that way?\" Mark said tentatively. Mary-Lynnette could see Rowan\n andKestrel behind him and Jade. They all looked alarmed.\n \"I can\u0027t be friends with anybody who\u0027s a bigot,\"she said to all of them. She gave Ash a jab for\n emphasis.\n \"We\u0027re not,\" Jade said virtuously.\"Wedon\u0027t be lieve that stupid stuff.\"\n \"We really don\u0027t,\" Rowan said. \"And Mary-Lynnette-our father is alwaysyellingat Ash for visiting\n the wrong kind of people on the Outside. Belonging to a dub that admits werewolves, havingwerewolves\n for friends. The Elders all say he\u0027s too liberal about that.\"\n Oh. \"Well, he\u0027s got a funny way of showing it,\" Mary-Lynnette said, deflating slightly.\n \"I just thought I\u0027d mention that,\" Rowan said.\"Now we\u0027ll leave you alone.\" She herded the others\n back toward the front of the station.\n When they were gone, Ash said, \"Can I move now, please?\" He looked as if he was in a very bad\n mood.\n Mary-Lynnette gave up. She felt tired, suddenlytired and emotionally drained. Too much had happened\n in the last few days. And it kept happening, it never let up, and ... well, she was tired, that\u0027s all.\n \"If you\u0027d go away soon, it would be easier,\" shesaid, moving away from Ash. She could feel her\n headsag slightly.\n \"Mary-Lynnette . . .\" There was something inAsh\u0027s voice that she\u0027d never heard before. \"Look\n it\u0027s not exactly a matter of me wanting to go away.There\u0027s somebody else from the Night World coming\n on Monday. His name is Quinn. And if my sistersand I don\u0027t go back with him, the whole town is in\n trouble. If he thinks anything irregular is going onhere ... You don\u0027t know what the Night Peoplecan do.\"\n Mary-Lynnette could hear her heart beating distinctly. She didn\u0027t turn back to look at Ash.\n \"They could wipe Briar Creek out. I mean it. They\u0027ve done things like that, to preserve the secret.\n It\u0027s the only protection they have from your kind.\"\n Mary-Lynnette said-not defiantly, but with simpleconviction, \"Your sisters aren\u0027t going to leave.\"\n \"Then the whole town\u0027s in trouble. There\u0027s a roguewerewolf, three renegade lamia, and a secret\n vampirekiller wandering around somewhere-not to mention twohumans who know about the Night\n World. This is a paranormal disaster area.\"\n A long silence. Mary-Lynnette was trying very hard not to see \"things from Ash\u0027s point of view. Atlast\n she said, \"So what do you want me to do?\"\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know, why don\u0027t we all have a pizza party and watch TV?\" Ash sounded savage. \"I\n haveno idea what to do,\" he added in more normal tones.\"And you\u0027d better believe I\u0027ve been thinking\n about it. The only thing I can come up with is that the girlshave to go back with me, and we all have to lie\n through our teeth to Quinn.\"\n Mary-Lynnette tried to think, but her head was throbbing.\n \"There is one other possibility,\" Ash said. He saidit under his breath, as if he wouldn\u0027t mind if she\n pretended not to hear him.\n Mary-Lynnette eased a crick in her neck, watchingblue-and-yellow images of the sun on her shut\n eyelids. \"What?\"\n \"I know you and the girls did a blood-tie ceremony. It was illegal, but that\u0027s beside the point.\n You\u0027re part of the reason they don\u0027t want to leavehere.\"\n Mary-Lynnette opened her mouth to point out thatthey didn\u0027t want to leave because life had been\n unbearable for them in the Night World, but Ash hurried on. \"But maybe if you were-like us, we could\n work something out. I could take the girls back to the island, and then in a few months I could get them\n out again. We\u0027d go someplace where nobodywould know us. Nobody would suspect there was anything\n irregular about you. The girls would be free,and you\u0027d be there, so there\u0027s no reason they shouldn\u0027t be\n happy. Your brother could come, too.\"\n Mary-Lynnette turned around slowly. She examined Ash. The sun brought out hidden warm tonesin his\n hair, making it a shimmering blond somewherebetween Jade\u0027s and Kestrel\u0027s. His eyes were shadowed,\n some dark color. He stood lanky and elegantas ever, but with one hand in his pocket and a pained\n expression on his face.\n \"Don\u0027t frown; you\u0027ll spoil your looks,\" she said. \"For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t patronize mel\" he yelled.\n Mary-Lynnette was startled. Well. Okay.\n \"I think,\" she said, more cautiously but with emphasis to let him know that she was the one with a\n right to be upset, \"that you are suggesting changing me into a vampire.\"\n The corner of Ash\u0027s mouth jerked. He put his other hand in his pocket and looked away. \"That was the\n general idea, yes.\"\n \"So that your sisters can be happy.\"\n \"So that you don\u0027t get killed by some vigilante like Quinn.\"\n \"But aren\u0027t the Night People going to kill me just the same if you change me?\"\n \"Only if they findyou,\" Ash said savagely. \"And if we can get away from here clean, they\n wouldn\u0027t.Anyway, as a vampire you\u0027d have a better chance of fighting them.\"\n \"So I\u0027m supposed to become a vampire and leave everything I love here so your sisters can be\n happy.\"\n Ash just stared angrily at the roof of the building across the street. \"Forget it.\"\n \"Believe me, I wasn\u0027t even thinking about it in the first place.\"\n \"Fine.\" He continued to stare. All at once Mary-Lynnette had the horrible feeling that his eyes\n were wet.\n And I\u0027ve cried I don\u0027t know how many times inthe last two days-and I only used to cry when thestars\n were so beautiful it hurt. There\u0027s somethingwrongwith me now. I don\u0027t even know who I am anymore.\n There seemed to be something wrong with Ash, too.\n \"Ash ...\"\n He didn\u0027t look at her. His jaw was tight.\n The problem is that there isn\u0027t any tidy answer, Mary-Lynnette thought. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said huskily,\n trying to shake off the strange feelings that hadsuddenly descended on her. \"It\u0027s just that everything\u0027s\n turned out so ... weird.I never asked for any of this.\" She swallowed. \"I guess you never askedfor it,\n either. First your sisters running away ...and then me. Some joke, yeah?\"\n \"Yeah.\" He wasn\u0027t staring off into the distance anymore. \"Look ... I might as well tell you.I didn\u0027t\n ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I\u0027d be in ... involved ...with a,human, I\u0027d have\n knocked his head off. I mean, after howls of derisive laughter. But.\"\n He stopped. That seemed to be the end of his confession:but.Of course, he didn\u0027t really need to say\n more. Mary-Lynnette, arms folded over her chest, stared at a curved piece of glass on the ground and\n tried to think of other phrases that started with in.Besides the obvious. She couldn\u0027t come up with any.\n She resisted the impulse to nudge the glass with her foot. \"I\u0027m a bad influence on your sisters.\"\n \"I said that to protect you. To try and protect you.\"\"I can protect myself.\"\n \"So I\u0027ve noticed,\" -he said dryly. \"Does that help?\"\n \"You noticing? No, because you don\u0027t really believe it. You\u0027ll always think I\u0027m weaker than\n you, softer ...even if you didn\u0027t say it, I\u0027d know you were thinking it.\"\n Ash suddenly looked crafty. His eyes were as greenas hellebore flowers. \"If you were a vampire, you\n wouldn\u0027t be weaker,\" he said. \"Also, you\u0027d know what I was really thinking.\" He held out his hand.\n \"Want a sample?\"\n Mary-Lynnette said abruptly, \"We\u0027d better get back. They\u0027re going to think we\u0027ve killed each other.\"\n \"Let them,\" Ash said, his hand still held out, but Mary-Lynnette just shook her head and walked\n She was scared. Wherever she\u0027d been going with Ash, she\u0027d been getting in too deep. And she\n wondered how much of their conversation had been audible around front.\n When she rounded the corner, her eyes immediately went to Jeremy. He was standing with Kestrel by\n the gas pump. They were dose together, and forjust an instant Mary-Lynnette felt something like startled\n dismay.\n Then her inner voice asked, Are you insane? You can\u0027t be jealous over him while you\u0027re worrying\n whether he\u0027s jealous over you, and meanwhile worrying about what to do with your soulmate.... It\u0027s good\n if he and Kestrel like each other.\n \"I don\u0027t care; I can\u0027t wait anymore,\" Jade was saying to Rowan on the sidewalk. \"I\u0027ve got to find\n him.\"\n \"She thinks Tiggy\u0027s gone home,\" Rowan said, seeing Mary-Lynnette. Ash went toward Rowan.\n Kestrel did, too. Somehow Mary-Lynnette was left beside Jeremy.\n Once again, she didn\u0027t know the etiquette. Sheglanced at him-and stopped feeling awkward. He was\n watching her in his quiet, level way.\n But then he startled her. He threw a look at thesidewalk and said, \"Mary-Lynnette, be careful.\"\n \"What?\"\n \" Be careful. \"It was the same tone he\u0027d used whenwarning her about Todd and Vic.\n Mary-Lynnette followed his gaze ... to Ash.\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She didn\u0027t know how to explain. Even his own sisters hadn\u0027t\n believed Ash wouldn\u0027t hurt her.\n Jeremy looked bleak. \"I know guys like that.Sometimes they bring human girls to their clubsand you\n don\u0027t want to know why. So just just watch yourself, all right?\"\n It was a nasty shock. Rowan and the girls had saidsimilar things, but coming from Jeremy it sank in,\n somehow. Ash had undoubtedly done things in his life that ... well, that would make her want to kill him if\n she knew. Things you couldn\u0027t just forget about.\n \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" she said. She realized her fists were clenched, and she said with a glimmer of\n humor, \"I can handle him.\"\n Jeremy still looked bleak. His brown eyes were\n dark and his jaw was tight as he looked at Ash. Underhis quietness, Mary-Lynnette could sense leashed\n power. Cold anger. Protectiveness. And the fact that he didn\u0027t like Ash at all .\n The others were coming back. \"I\u0027ll be all right,\" Mary-Lynnette whispered quickly.\n Aloud, Jeremy said, \"I\u0027ll keep thinking about the people around town. I\u0027ll tell you if I come up with\n something.\"\n Mary-Lynnette nodded. \"Thanks, Jeremy.\" She tried to give him a reassuring look as everybody got into\n the car.\n He stood watching as she pulled out of the gas station. He didn\u0027t wave.\n \"Okay, so we go home,\" Mark said. \"And then what?\"\n Nobody answered. Mary-Lynnette realized that she had no idea what.\n \"I guess we\u0027d better figure out if we still have anysuspects,\" she said at last.\n \"There\u0027s something else we\u0027ve got to do, first,\" Rowan said softly. \"We vampires, I mean.\"\n Mary-Lynnette could tell just by the way she said it. But Mark asked, \"What?\"\n \"We need to feed,\" Kestrel said with her most radiant smile.\n They got back to Burdock Farm. There was no sign of the cat. The four vampires headed for the\n woods, Jadecalling for Tiggy, and Mary-Lynnette headed for Mrs. B.\u0027s rolltop desk. She got engraved\n stationery only slightly mildewed at the edges-and a silver pen with a fussy Victorian pattern on it. \"Now,\"\n she said to Mark as she sat at the kitchen table. \"We\u0027re going to play List the Suspects.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing in this house to eat, you know,\" Mark said. He had all the cupboards open. \"Just\n things like instant coffee and green Jujyfruits. The ones everybody leaves.\"\n \"What can I say, your girlfriend is undead. Come on. Sit down and concentrate.\" Mark sat down\n and sighed. \"Who have we got?\"\n \"We should have gone to find out what the dealwas with that horse,\" Mark said.\n Mary-Lynnette stopped with her pen poised overthe stationery. \"You\u0027re right, that must be connected. I\n forgot about it.\" Which just goes to show you, detective work doesn\u0027t mix with 1-with idle dawdling.\n \"All right,\" she said grimly. \"So let\u0027s assume that whoever killed the horse was the same person\n who killed Aunt Opal and the goat. And maybe the sameperson who broke the gas station window-that\n hap pened last night, too. Where does that get us?\"\n \"I think it was Todd and Vic,\" Mark said.\n \"You\u0027re not being helpful.\"\n \"I\u0027m serious. You know how Todd is always chewing on that toothpick. And there were\n toothpicks stuck in the goat.\"\n Toothpicks... now, what did that remind her of? No, not toothpicks, the bigger stakes. Why couldn\u0027t\n she remember ?\n She rubbed her forehead, giving up. \"Okay...I\u0027llput Todd and Vic, vampire hunters, with a question\n mark. Unless you think they\u0027re vampires themselves.\"\n \"Nope,\" Mark said, undeterred by her sarcasm. \"I think Jade would\u0027ve noticed that when she\n drank their blood.\" He eyed her thoughtfully. \"You\u0027re the smart one. Who doyou think did it?\"\n \"I have no idea.\" Mark made a face at her, andshe doodled a stake on the stationery. The doodle\n changed into a very small stake, more like a pencil,held by a feminine hand. She never could draw\n \"Oh, my God. Bunny.\"\n \"Bunny did it?\" Mark asked ingenuously, preparedto be straight man for a joke.\n But Mary-Lynnette said,\"Yes.I mean-no, I don\u0027t know. But those stakes in the goat-the big ones I\u0027ve\n seen herusingthem. She uses them on her nails. They\u0027re cuticle sticks.\"\n \"Well ...\" Mark looked dismayed. \"But I mean ... Bunny . C\u0027mon. She can\u0027t kill a mosquito.\"\n Mary-Lynnette shook her head, agitated. \"Rowan said she had a lamia name. And she said something\n strange to me-Bunny-the day I was looking for Todd and Vic.\" It was all coming back now, a flood of\n memories that she didn\u0027t particularly want. \"She said, \u0027Good hunting.\"\u0027\n \"Mare, it\u0027s from The Jungle Book .\"\n \"I know. It was still weird for her to say. And she\u0027s almosttoosweet and scared-what if it\u0027s all an\n act?\" When Mark didn\u0027t answer, she said, \"Is it any more unlikelythan Todd and Vic being vampire\n hunters?\"\n \"So put her down, too.\"\n Mary-Lynnette did. Then she said, \"You know, there\u0027s something I keep meaning to ask Rowanabout\n how they wrote to Mrs. B. from thatisland-\" She broke off and tensed as the back door banged.\n \"Am I the first one back?\"\n It was Rowan, windblown and glowing, slightlybreathless. Her hair was a tumbling chestnut loud around\n her.\n \"Where\u0027s everybody else?\" Mary-Lynnette asked.\n \"We separated early on. It\u0027s the only way, you know, with four of us in this small of an area.\"\n \"Small!\" Mark looked offended. \"If Briar Creekhas one good thing-and I\u0027m not saying it does it\u0027s\n space.\"\n Rowan smiled. \"For a hunting range, it is small,\"she said. \"No offense. It\u0027s fine for us-we never got to\n hunt at -all on the island. They brought our mealsto us, tranquilized and completely passive.\"\n Mary-Lynnette pushed away the image this evoked. \"Urn, you want to register a guess on Whodunit?\"\n 0Rowan sat down in a kitchen chair, smoothing a wisp of brown hair off her forehead. \"I don\u0027t know. I\n wonder if it\u0027s somebody we haven\u0027t even thought of yet.\"\n Mary-Lynnette remembered what she\u0027d been talking about when the door banged. \"Rowan, I always\n meant to ask you-you said that only Ash could havefigured out where you were going when you ran\n away. But what about the guy who helped yousmuggle letters off the island? He would know where your\n aunt lived, right? He could see the address on the letters.\"\n \"Crane Linden.\" Rowan smiled, a sad little smile. \"No, he wouldn\u0027t know. He\u0027s ...\" She touched\n her temple lightly. \"I don\u0027t know what you call it. His mind never developed completely. He can\u0027t read.\n But he\u0027s very kind.\"\n There were illiterate vampires? Well, why not?Aloud Mary-Lynnette said, \"Oh. Well, I guess it\u0027s one\n more person we can eliminate.\"\n \"Look, can we just brainstorm a minute?\" Mark said. \"This is probably crazy, but what if\n Jeremy\u0027suncle isn\u0027t really dead? And what if-\" At that moment, there was a crash from the front porch.\n No, a tap-tap-crash, Mary-Lynnette thought. Then she thought, Oh, God . . . Tiggy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-14.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
