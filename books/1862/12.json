{"id":82076,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"What happened then was interesting. Mary-Lynnette got to see the sisters do all the things she\u0027dmissed earlier in the clearing. All the hissing and the clawed fingers. Just like the movies. Except that when a vampire hissed, it sounded real. Like a cat, not like a person imitating a cat. All three girls jumped up and stood ready to fight. There wasn\u0027t any weird grimacing. But Jade and Kestrel were showing teeth that were long and beautifully curved, coming to delicate feline points that indented the lower lip. And something else. Their eyes changed. Jade\u0027s silvery-green eyes went even more silvery. Kestrel\u0027s golden eyes looked jewel-yellow, like a hawk\u0027s. Even Rowan\u0027s eyes had a dark light in them. \"Oh, boy,\" Mark whispered. He was standing beside Jade, staring from her to Ash. Ash said, \"Hi.\" Don\u0027t look at him, Mary-Lynnette told herself. Herheart was pounding wildly and her knees were trembling. The attraction of particle to antiparticle,she thought, remembering a line from last year\u0027sphysics lass. But there was another, shorter namefor it, and no matter what she said to herself, she couldn\u0027t keep it out of her mind. Soulmates. Oh, God, I really don\u0027t want this. Please, please, Ididn\u0027t ask for this. I want to discover a supernova and study mini-quasars at the Gamma Ray Observatory. I want to be the one who solves the mystery of where all the dark matter in the universe is. I don\u0027t want this. It should have happened to someone like BunnyMarten, someone who spent timelonging for romance. The only thing Mary-Lynnette longed for wassomebody to understand ... ... to understand the night with you,a distant part ofher mind whispered. And instead here she was, stuck with a guy whose own sisters were terrified of him. It was true. That was why they were standingpoised to fight, making threatening noises. Even Kestrel was afraid of him. The moment Mary-Lynnette realized that, anger washed out the trembling dismay inside her. Whatever she felt about Ash, she wasn\u0027t afraid of him. \"Don\u0027t you ever knock?\" she said and walked toward him. Strode toward him. She had to hand it to her new family. Both Jadeand Kestrel tried to grab her and keep her from getting close to their brother. Protecting her. MaryLynnette shook them off. Ash eyed her warily. \"Oh. You,\" he said. Unenthusiastically. \"What are you doing here?\" \"It\u0027s my uncle\u0027s house.\" \"It\u0027s your aunt\u0027s house and you weren\u0027t invited.\" Ash looked at his sisters. Mary-Lynnette could justsee little wheels turning in his head. Had they already told about the Night World or not? Of course, if they hadn\u0027t, their behavior should be giving somebody a due. Most human girls didn\u0027t hiss. Ash held one finger up. \"Okay. Now, listen\" Mary-Lynnette kicked him in the shins. She knew it was inappropriate, she knew it was uncalled-for, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself. She just had to. \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake,\" Ash said, hopping backward. \"Are you crazy?\" \"Yes, she is,\" Mark said, abandoning Jade and hurrying forward to take Mary-Lynnette\u0027s arm. \"Everybody knows she\u0027s crazy. She can\u0027t help it.\" He backedup, pulling. He was looking at Mary-Lynnette as if she\u0027d taken all her clothes off and started to dance the mambo. So were Kestrel and Jade. Their eyes had gone ordinary, their teeth retracted. They\u0027d never seen anyone treat their brother quite this way. And to have a human doing it ... If the girls had superhuman strength, Ash was undoubtedly even stronger. He could probably flatten Mary-Lynnette with one blow. She still couldn\u0027t help it. She wasn\u0027t afraid of him, only of herself and the stupid floating feeling in her stomach. The way her legs wanted to fold under her. \"Will somebody just tell her not to do that anymore?\" Ash was saying. Kestrel and Jade looked sideways at Mary-Lynnette. Mary-Lynnette shrugged at them, her breath coming quickly. She saw that Rowan was looking at her, too, butnot in the same dumbfounded way. Rowan looked worried and surprised and sorry. \"You\u0027ve met,\" she said. \"I should have told you,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Hecame to our house. He was asking my stepmotherabout you and your friends-saying that he needed to approve them because he was head of the family.\" All three girls looked at Ash with narrowed eyes. \"So you have been around,\" Kestrel said. \"Forhow long?\" Rowan said quietly, \"What are -you really doinghere?\" Ash let go of his shin. \"Can we all sit down and talk about this like reasonable people?\" Everyone looked at Mary-Lynnette. She took a deep, calming breath. She still felt as if her entire skin was electrified, but her heart was slowing down. \"Yes,\" she said and worked at looking normal so they\u0027d know her temporary insanity was over. As he helped her to the couch, Mark whispered, \"I have to tell you, I\u0027ve never seen you act so immature before. I\u0027m proud of you.\" Even big sisters have to have some off time, Mary-Lynnette thought. She patted him vaguely and sat, feeling tired. Ash settled in a plush-covered chair. Rowan andKestrel sat beside Mary-Lynnette. Mark and Jade shared an ottoman. \"All right,\" Ash said. \"Now can we fast introduce ourselves? I presume that\u0027s your brother.\" \"Mark,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Mark, that\u0027s Ash.\" Mark nodded. He and Jade were holding hands. Mary-Lynnette saw Ash\u0027s eyes drop to their intertwined fingers. She couldn\u0027t tell anything from his expression. \"Okay. Now.\" Ash looked at Rowan. \"I\u0027m here to take you back home, where everyone misses you violently.\" Jade breathed, \"Give me a break.\" Kestrel said, \"What if we don\u0027t want to be taken?\" and showed her teeth briefly. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t find that strange. What she found strange was that Ash didn\u0027t return the smile. He didn\u0027t look lazy or sardonic or smug right then. He looked like somebody who wants to get a job over with. Rowan said, \"We can\u0027t go home, Ash.\" Her breathing was slightly irregular, but her chin was high. \"Well, you have to come home. Because otherwisethere are going to be some fairly drastic consequences.\" \"We knew that when we left,\" Jade said, with aslittle emotion as Rowan. Her chin was high, too. \"Well, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve really thought itthrough.\" Ash\u0027s voice had an edge. \"We\u0027d rather die than go back,\" Jade said. Kestrel glanced at her quickly, one eyebrow raised. \"Oh, well, fine, I\u0027ll just make a note of that,\" Ash said tightly. Then his expression darkened. He lookedmore determined than Mary-Lynnette would have thought he could look. Not in the least like a big blond cat. Like a lanky, elegant pale tiger. \"Now, listen,\" he said. \"There are a few smallthings that you don\u0027t understand, and I don\u0027t have any time to play games. So how about we send yourlittle friends home and then we can all have a fam ily talk.\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s hands clenched into fists. Mark clutched at Jade, who pushed him awayslightly with her elbow. She was frowning. \"I think maybe you\u0027d better,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not going to leave you.\" Rowan bit her lip. \"Mark ...\" \"I\u0027m not going. Don\u0027t try to protect me. He\u0027s not stupid, sooner or later he\u0027s going to find out that we know about the Night World.\" Rowan drew in her breath involuntarily. Kestrel\u0027s expression never changed, but her muscles. tensed as if for a fight. Jade\u0027s eyes went silver. Mary-Lynnette sat very still. They all looked at Ash. Ash looked heavenward. \"I know you know,\" he said with deadly patience.\"I\u0027m trying to get you out, you poor sap, before I find out how much you know.\" The sisters stared. Mary-Lynnette opened hermouth and then shut it again. \"I thought you didn\u0027t like humans,\" Mark said. \"I don\u0027t; I hate them,\" Ash said with brittle cheer. \"Then why would you want to cut me a break?\"\"Because if I kill you, I have to kill your sister,\" Ash informed him, with a smile that would have fit in perfectly at the Mad Hatter\u0027s tea party. \"So what; she kicked you.\" Ash stopped tossing answers back like footballs. \"Yeah, well, I may change my mind any minute.\" \"No, wait, \" Jade said. She was sitting with legs folded under her, staring at her brother fiercely. \"This is just too weird. Why would you care whathappens to a human?\" Ash didn\u0027t say anything. He looked at the fire place bitterly. It was Rowan who said softly, \"Because they\u0027re soulmates.\" An instant of silence, then everybody started talking explosively. \"They\u0027re what? You mean, like what Jade and Iare?\" \"Oh, Ash, this is rich. I just wish our father were here to see this.\" \"It is not my fault, \"Mary-Lynnette said. She found everyone turning toward her, and realized that her eyes were full. Rowan leaned across Kestrel to put her hand on Mary-Lynnette\u0027s arm. \"You mean it\u0027s really true?Mark said, looking from Mary-Lynnette to Ash. \"It\u0027s true. I guess. I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s supposed to be like,\" Mary-Lynnette said, concentrating on making the tears go away. \"It\u0027s true,\" Ash said moodily. \"It doesn\u0027t meanwe\u0027re going todo anything about it.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ve got that right,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She was glad to be angry again. \"So let\u0027s all just pick up our toys and go home,\"Ash said in the general direction of his sisters. \"We\u0027llforget all about this; we\u0027ll just agree that it neverhappened.\" Rowan was watching him, shaking her head slightly.There were tears in her eyes, but she was smiling. \"I never thought I\u0027d hear you say something likethat,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve changed so much-I can\u0027t believe it.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it, either,\" Ash said bleakly. \"Maybe it\u0027s a dream.\" \"But you have to admit now that humans aren\u0027tvermin. You couldn\u0027t be soulmates with vermin.\" \"Yes. Fine. Humans are terrific. We all agree; nowlet\u0027s go home.\" \"When we were kids, you were like this,\" Rowan said. \"Before you started acting like you were better than everyone. I always knew a lot of that was just show. To hide how scared you were. And I always knew you didn\u0027t really believe a lot of the horriblestuff you said. Somewhere inside, you\u0027re still that nice little kid, Ash.\" Ash produced his first really flashingsmile of theevening. \"Don\u0027t bet on it.\" Mary-Lynnette had listened to all this feeling shakier and shakier. To conceal it, she said to Rowan, \"I don\u0027t think your aunt thought so.\" Ash sat up. \"Hey, where is the old hag, anyway?I need to have a talk with her before we leave.\" This silence seemed endless. \"Ash ... don\u0027t you know?\" Rowan said. \"Of course he knows. Ten to one, he did it,\" Kestrel said. \"What is it that I\u0027m supposed to know?\" Ash said, with every sign of being about to lose his patience. \"Your aunt\u0027s dead,\" Mark told him. \"Somebody staked her,\" Jade added. Ash looked around the room. His expression said he suspected it was a practical joke. Oh, God, Mary Lynnette thought numbly, when he\u0027s startled and bewildered like that he looks so young. Vulnerable. Almost human. \"Somebody ... murdered ... Aunt Opal. That\u0027s what you\u0027re telling me?\" \"Are you telling us that you don\u0027t know?\" Kestrel asked. \"What have you beendoing all night, Ash?\" \"Banging my head against a rock,\" Ash said. \"Thenlooking for you. When I walked in you were talking about me.\" \"And you didn\u0027t run across any livestock tonight?Any-let\u0027s say-goats?\" Ash gave her a long, incredulous look. \"I fed, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking. Not on a goat.Whatdoes this have to do with Aunt Opal?\" \"I think we\u0027d better show him,\" Rowan said. She was the one who got up and lifted the fold ofrug away from the goat. Ash walked around thecouch to see what she was doing. Mary-Lynnette turned to watch his face. He winced. But he controlled it quickly. Rowan said quietly, \"Look at what was in the goat\u0027s mouth.\" Ash picked up the black flower gingerly. \"An Iris. So?\" \u0027Been to your club recently?\" Kestrel asked. Ash gave her a weary look. \"If I had done this, why would I sign it with an iris?\" \"Maybe to tell us who did it.\" \"I don\u0027t have to kill goats to say things, you know. I can talk.\" Kestrel looked unimpressed. \"Maybe this way the message has a little more impact.\" \"Do I looklike the kind of person who wastes time turning goats into pincushions?\" \"No. No, I don\u0027t think you did this,\" Rowan said inher quiet way. \"But somebodydid-probably whoever killed Aunt Opal. We\u0027ve been trying to figure outwho.\" \"Well, who have we got for suspects?\" Everyone looked at Mary-Lynnette. She looked away. \"There\u0027s one who\u0027s pretty prime,\" Mark said. \"Hisname\u0027s Jeremy Lovett. He\u0027s a real-\" \"Quiet guy,\" Mary-Lynnette interrupted. If anyonewas going to describe Jeremy, it was going to be her. \"I\u0027ve known him since elementary school, and I would never,ever have believed he could hurt any body-especially an old lady and ananimal.\" \"But his uncle was crazy,\" Mark said. \"And I\u0027veheard things about hisfamily-\" \"Nobodyknows anything about his family,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She felt as if she were struggling to keep her head above water, with barbells tied to herwrists and ankles. What was dragging her downwasn\u0027t Mark\u0027s suspicion - It was her own. The littlevoice in her head that was saying, \"But he seemed like such a nice guy\"--and which meant, of course, that he wasn\u0027t. Ash was watching her with a brooding, intent expression. \"What does this Jeremy look like?\" Something about the way he said it irritated MaryLynnette beyond belief. \"What do you care?\" Ash blinked and shifted his gaze. He shrugged minimallyand said with forced blandness, \"Just curious.\" \"He\u0027svery handsome,\" Mary-Lynnette said.Gooda way to let out her anger and frustration. \"And the thing is that he looks very intelligent andsensitive-it\u0027s not empty good looks. He\u0027s got hair that\u0027s sort of the color of Ponderosa pinecones andthe most wonderful brown eyes.... He\u0027s thin andtan and a little bit taller than me, because I\u0027m normally looking at his mouth....\" Ash didn\u0027t look pleased. \"I saw somebody vaguelylike that at the gas station -in town.\" He turned to Rowan. \"You think he\u0027s some kind of outlawvampire?\" \"Obviously not a made vampire because MaryLynnette has watched him grow up,\" Rowan said. \"I was thinking more that he might be renegade lamia.But there\u0027s not much use in trying to figure it out from here. Tomorrow we can go and see him, and then we\u0027ll know more. Right?\" Mark nodded. Jade nodded. Mary-Lynnette took adeep breath and nodded. Ash nodded and said, \"All right, I see why you can\u0027t go home until this is solved. So, we\u0027ll figureout who killed Aunt Opal, and then we\u0027ll take the appropriate action, and then we\u0027ll go home. Got it?\" His sisters exchanged glances. They didn\u0027t answer. As she and mark walked back to their house,Mary-Lynnette noticed that Sirius had lifted abovethe eastern horizon. It hung like a jewel, brighterthan she had ever seen it before-much brighter. Itseemed almost like a miniature sun, flashing with blue and gold and violet rays. She thought the effect must be psychological,,until she remembered that she\u0027d exchanged blood with three vampires.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-12.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
