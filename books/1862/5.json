{"id":82070,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Mark was still muttering as he rounded the backcorner of the house. What was he even doinghere?\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t easy to get into the garden area fromoutside. He had to bushwhack through the overgrown\\n\\n rhododendron bushes and blackberry canesthat formedadense hedge all around it. And evenwhen he\\n\\n emerged from a tunnel of leathery greenleaves, the scene in front of him didn\u0027t immediatelyregister. His\\n\\n momentum kept him going for a fewsteps before his brain caught up.\\n\\n Hey, wait. There\u0027sa girl here.\\n\\n A pretty girl. Anextremelypretty girl. He could seeher clearly by the back porch light. She had hiplength\\n\\n white-blond hair, the color that normally onlypreschoolers have, and it was as fine as a child\u0027s hair,too,\\n\\n whipping around her like pale silk when shemoved. She was smallish. Little bones. Her hands and feet\\n\\n were delicate.\\n\\n She was wearing what looked like an oldfashioned nightshirt and dancing to what sounded like a\\n\\n rent-to-own commercial. There was a battereddock radio on the porch steps. There was also a black\\n\\n kitten that took one look at Mark and darted away into the shadows.\\n\\n \"Baaad cred-it,nooo cred-it, dooon\u0027t wor-ry,weee\u0027ll take you....\" the radio warbled. The girl\\n\\n danced with her arms above her head-light as thistledown,Mark thought, staring in astonishment. Really,\\n\\n actu ally that light, and so what if it was a cliche\\n\\n As the commercial ended and a country western song began, she did a twirl and saw him. Shestopped,\\n\\n frozen, arms still above her head, wristscrossed. Her eyes got big and her mouth sagged open.\\n\\n She\u0027s scared, Mark thought. Of me. The girl didn\u0027t look graceful now; she was scrambling to seize the\\n\\n dock radio, fumbling with it, shaking it. Trying to find an Off switch, Mark realized. Her desperation was\\n\\n contagious. Before he thought, Mark dropped the pruning shears and swooped in to grab the radio from\\n\\n her. He twisted the top dial, cutting the song short. Then he stared at the girl, who stared backwith wide\\n\\n silvery-green eyes. They were both breath ing quickly, as if they\u0027d just disarmed a bomb.\\n\\n \"Hey, I hate country western, too,\" Mark said aftera minute, shrugging.\\n\\n He\u0027d never talked to a girl this way before. But then he\u0027d never had a girl look scared of him before.\\n\\n And so scared-he imagined he could see her heartbeating in the pale blue veins beneath the translucent\\n\\n skin of her throat.\\n\\n Then, suddenly, she stopped looking terrified. Shebit her lip and chortled. Then, still grinning, she blinked\\n\\n and sniffed.\\n\\n \"I forgot,\" she said, dabbing at the corner of her eye. \"You don\u0027t have the same rules we do.\"\\n\\n \"Rules about country western music?\" Mark hazarded. He liked her voice. It was ordinary, not\\n\\n celestial. It made her seem more human.\\n\\n \"Rules about any music from outside,\" she said. \"And any TV, too.\"\\n\\n Outside what? Mark thought. He said, \"Uh, hi. I\u0027m Mark Carter.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Jade Redfern.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re one of Mrs. Burdock\u0027s nieces.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. We just came last night. We\u0027re going to livehere.\"\\n\\n Mark snorted and muttered, \"You have my condolences.\"\\n\\n \"Condolences? Why?\" Jade cast a darting glance around the garden.\\n\\n \"Because living in Briar Creek is just slightly moreexciting than living in a cemetery.\"\\n\\n She gave him a long, fascinated look. \"You\u0027ve... lived in a cemetery?\"\\n\\n He gaveher along look. \"Uh, actually, I just meant it\u0027s boring here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She thought, then smiled. \"Well, it\u0027s interesting to us,\" she said. \"It\u0027s different from where\\n\\n we come from.\"\\n\\n \"And just wheredo you come from?\"\\n\\n \"An island. It\u0027s sort of near ...\" She considered. \"The state of Maine.\\n\\n \"\u0027The state of Maine.\"\u0027\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Does this island have a name?\"\\n\\n She stared at him with wide green eyes. \"Well, I can\u0027t tell youthat.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-okay.\" Was, she making fun of him? Butthere was nothing like mockery or sly teasing in her\\n\\n face. She looked mysterious ... and innocent. Maybe she had some kind of mental problem. The kids at\\n\\n Dewitt High School would have a field day with that. They weren\u0027t very tolerant of differences.\\n\\n \"Look,\" he said abruptly. \"If there\u0027s ever anything I can do for you-you know, if you ever get in\\n\\n trouble or something-then just tell me. Okay?\"\\n\\n She tilted her head sideways. Her eyelashes actually cast shadows in the porch light, but her expression\\n\\n wasn\u0027t coy. It was straightforward and assessing,and she was looking him over carefully, as if she needed\\n\\n to figure him out. She took her time doingit. Then she smiled, making little dimples in her cheeks, and\\n\\n Mark\u0027s heart jumped unexpectedly.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she said softly. \"Mark. You\u0027re not silly, even though you\u0027re a boy. You\u0027re a good guy,\\n\\n aren\u0027tyou?\"\\n\\n \"Well. . .\"Mark had never been called upon to be a good guy, not in the TV sense. He wasn\u0027t\\n\\n surehow he\u0027d measure up if he were. \"I, um, hope I\\n\\n 0am.\"\\n\\n Jade was looking at him steadily. \"You know, I just decided. I\u0027m going to like it here.\" She smiledagain,\\n\\n and Mark found it hard to breathe-and then her expression changed.\\n\\n Mark heard it, too. A wild crashing in the overgrown tangle of rhododendrons and blackberrybushes at\\n\\n the back of the garden. It was a weird,frenzied sound, but Jade\u0027s reaction was out of all proportion. She\\n\\n had frozen, body tense andtrembling, eyes fixed on the underbrush. She looked terrified.\\n\\n \"Hey.\" Mark spoke gently, then touched hershoulder. \"Hey. It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s probably one of the\\n\\n goats that got loose; goats can jump over any kind of fence.\" She was shaking her head. \"Or a deer.\\n\\n When they\u0027re relaxed they sound just like people walking.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a deer,\" she hissed.\\n\\n \"They come down and eat people\u0027s gardens a. night. You probably don\u0027t have deer roaming\\n\\n aroundwhere you come from-\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027tsmellanything,\" she said in a kind of whispered wail. \"It\u0027s that stupid pen. Everything smells like\\n\\n goat. \"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t smell ... ? Mark did the only thinghe could think of in response to a statement like that. He\\n\\n put his arms around the girl.\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s okay,\" he said softly. He couldn\u0027thelp but notice that she was cool and warm at the\\n\\n same time, supple, wonderfully alive underneath the nightshirt. \"Why don\u0027t I take you inside now? You\u0027ll\\n\\n be safe there.\"\\n\\n \"Leggo,\" Jade said ungratefully, squirming. \"I mayhave to fight.\" She wriggled out of his arms and\\n\\n faced the bushes again. \"Stay behind me.\"\\n\\n Okay, so sheis crazy. I don\u0027t care. I think I love her.\\n\\n He stood beside her. \"Look, I\u0027ll fight, too. What doyou think it is? Bear, coyote ... ?\"\"My brother.\"\\n\\n \"Your . . .\" Dismay pooled in Mark. She\u0027d just stepped over the line of acceptable craziness.\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n Another thrashing sound from the bushes. It was definitely something big, not a goat. Mark was just\\n\\n wondering vaguely if a Roosevelt elk could have wandered down the hundred or so miles from Waldo\\n\\n Lake, when a scream ripped through the air.\\n\\n A human scream-or, worse,almost human. As it died, there was a wail that was definitely inhumanit\\n\\n started out faint, and then suddenly sounded shrilland dose. Mark was stunned. When the drawn-out wail\\n\\n finally stopped, there was a sobbing, moaning sound, then silence.\\n\\n Mark got his breath and swore. \"What in thewhat wasthat?\"\\n\\n \"Shh. Keep still.\" Jade was in a half-crouch, eyes on the bushes.\\n\\n \"Jade-Jade, listen. We\u0027ve got to get inside.\" Desperate, he looped an arm around her waist,\\n\\n trying to pick her up. She was light, but she flowed like water out of his arms. Like a cat that doesn\u0027t\\n\\n want to bepetted. \"Jade, whatever that thing is, we need agun.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t.\" She seemed tobe speaking through herteeth-anyway there was something odd about\\n\\n her diction. She had her back to him and he couldn\u0027t see her face, but her hands were clawed.\\n\\n \"Jade,\"Mark said urgently. He was scared enoughto run, but he couldn\u0027t leave her. He couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n No good guy would do that.\\n\\n Too late. The blackberry bushes to the south quivered. Parted. Something was coming through.\\n\\n Mark\u0027s heart seemed to freeze solid, but then he found himself moving. Pushing Jade roughly aside.\\n\\n Standing in front of her to face whatever the thing in the dark was.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette kicked her way through the blackberry canes. Her arms and legs were scratched, and\\n\\n she could feel ripe, bright-black berries squishing against her. She\u0027d probably picked a bad place to get\\n\\n through the hedge, but she hadn\u0027t been thinking about that. She\u0027d been thinking about Mark, aboutfinding\\n\\n him as fast as possible and getting away from here.\\n\\n 0Just please let him be here, she thought. Let him be here and be okay and I\u0027ll never ask for anything\\n\\n She struggled through the last of the canes into thebackyard-and then things happened very fast. The first\\n\\n thing she saw was Mark, and she felt a rush of relief. Then a flash of surprise. Mark was standing in front\\n\\n of a girl, his arms lifted like a basketball guard. As if to protect her from Mary-Lynnette.\\n\\n And then, so quickly that Mary-Lynnette could barely follow the motion, the girl was rushing at her.\\n\\n And Mary-Lynnette was throwing her arms up and Mark was shouting, \"No, that\u0027s my sister!\"\\n\\n The girl stopped a foot away from Mary-Lynnette.It was the little silvery-haired one, of course. This\\n\\n dose Mary-Lynnette couldsee that she had green eyes and skin so translucent it almost looked like quartz\\n\\n crystal.\\n\\n \"Jade, it\u0027s my sister,\".Mark said again, as if anxiousto get this established. \"Her name\u0027s\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette.She won\u0027t hurt you. Mare, tell her you won\u0027t hurther.\"\\n\\n Hurt her? Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know what he wastalking about, and didn\u0027t want to. This girl was as\\n\\n weirdly beautiful as the others, and something abouther eyes-hey weren\u0027t ordinary green, but almost\\n\\n silvery-made Mary-Lynnette\u0027s skin rise ingoose pimples.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" Jade said.\\n\\n \"Hello. Okay, Mark, c\u0027mon. We\u0027ve got to go. Like right now.\"\\n\\n She expected him to agree immediately. He wasthe one who hadn\u0027t wanted to come, and now herehe\\n\\n was with his most dreaded phobia, a girl. But instead he said, \"Did you hear that yelling? Could you tell\\n\\n where it came from?\"\\n\\n \"What yelling? I was inside. Come on.\" MaryLynnette took Mark\u0027s arm, but since he was as\\n\\n strongas she was, it didn\u0027t do any good. \"Maybe I heardsomething. I wasn\u0027t paying attention.\" She\u0027d been\\n\\n looking desperately around the Victorian living room,babbling out lies about how her family knew where\\n\\n she\u0027d gone tonight and expected her back soon. How her father and stepmother were such good friends\\n\\n of Mrs. Burdock\u0027s and how they were just waiting at home to hear about Mrs. B.\u0027s nieces. She still\\n\\n wasn\u0027t sure if that was why they\u0027d let her go. But for somereason, Rowan had finally stood up, given\\n\\n MaryLynnette a grave, sweet smile, and opened the front door.\\n\\n \"You know, I bet it was a wolverine,\" Mark was saying to Jade excitedly. \"A wolverine that\\n\\n came down from Willamette Forest.\"\\n\\n Jade was frowning. \"A wolverine?\" She considered. \"Yeah, I guess that could have been it. I\u0027ve never\\n\\n heard one before.\" She looked at MaryLynnette. \"Is that what you think it was?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure,\" Mary-Lynnette said at random. \"Definitely a wolverine.\" I should ask where her aunt\\n\\n is, she thought suddenly. It\u0027s the perfect opportunity to catch her in a lie. I\u0027ll ask and then she\u0027llsay\\n\\n something-anything, but not that her aunt\u0027sgone up north for a little vacation on the coast. And then I\u0027ll\\n\\n know.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t do it. She simply didn\u0027t have the courage. She didn\u0027t want to catch anyone in a lie anymore;\\n\\n she just wanted to get out.\\n\\n \"Mark, please ...\"\\n\\n He looked at her and for the first time seemed tosee how upset she was. \"Uh-okay,\" he said. And to\\n\\n Jade: \"Look, why don\u0027t you go back inside now?You\u0027ll be safe there. And maybe-maybe I could come\\n\\n over again sometime?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette was still tugging at him, and now, to her relief, he began to move. Mary-Lynnette headed\\n\\n for the blackberry bushes that she\u0027d trampled coming in.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you go through there? It\u0027s like apath,\" Jadesaid,pointing. Mark immediately swerved,\\n\\n taking Mary-Lynnette with him, and she saw a comfortable gap between two rhododendron bushes at\\n\\n the back of the garden. She would never have seen it unless she knew what to look for.\\n\\n As they reached the hedge, Mark turned to glance behind him. Mary-Lynnette turned, too.\\n\\n From here, Jade was just a dark silhouette againstthe porch light-but her hair, lit from behind, looked\\n\\n like a silver halo. It shimmered around her. MaryLynnette heard Mark draw in his breath.\\n\\n \"You both come back sometime,\" Jade said cordially. \"Help us milk the goats like Aunt Opal\\n\\n said. She gave us very strict orders before she went on vacation.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette was dumbfounded.\\n\\n She turned back and reeled through the gap, her head spinning. When they got to the road she said,\\n\\n \"Mark, what happened when you got into the garden?\"\\n\\n Mark was looking preoccupied. \"What do you mean what happened? Nothing happened.\"\\n\\n \"Did you look at the place that was dug up?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Mark said shortly. \"Jade was in the gardenwhen I got there. I didn\u0027t get a chance to look at\\n\\n anything.\"\\n\\n \"Mark ... was she there the whole time? Jade?Did she ever go in the house? Or did either of the\\n\\n other girls ever come out?\"\\n\\n Mark grunted. \"I don\u0027t even know what the othergirls look like. The only one I saw was Jade, and she\\n\\n was there the whole time.\" He looked at her darkly. \"You\u0027re not still on this Rear Windowthing, are you?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t answer. She was trying to gather her scattered thoughts.\\n\\n I don\u0027t believe it. Butshe said it. Orders about the goats. Before her aunt went on vacation.\\n\\n But Rowan didn\u0027t know about the goats before I told her. I\u0027d swear she didn\u0027t know. And I was so sure\\n\\n she was winging it with the vacation business....\\n\\n Okay, maybe I was wrong. But that doesn\u0027t mean Rowan was telling the truth. Maybe they didfigure the\\n\\n story out before tonight, and Rowan\u0027s just a lousy actress. Or maybe ...\\n\\n 0 \"Mark, this is going to sound crazy ... but Jade didn\u0027t have, like, a cellular phone or anything, did\\n\\n she?\"\\n\\n Mark stopped dead and gave Mary-Lynnette a long, slow look that said more dearly than wordswhat\\n\\n he thought of this. \"Mary-Lynnette, what\u0027swrongwith you?\"\\n\\n \"Rowan and Kestrel told me that Mrs. B. is on vacation. That she suddenly decidedto take a\\n\\n vacation just when they arrived in town.\"\\n\\n \"So? Jade said the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"Mark, Mrs. B. has lived there for ten years, and she\u0027s nevertaken a vacation. Never. How could\\n\\n shetake one starting the same day her nieces come to live with her?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe because they can house-sit for her,\" Mark said with devastating logic.\\n\\n It was exactly what Rowanhad said. MaryLynnette had a sudden feeling of paranoia, like someone who\\n\\n realizes that everyone around her is a pod person, all in on the conspiracy. She had been aboutto tell him\\n\\n about the goats, but now she didn\u0027t want to.\\n\\n Oh, geta gripon yourself, girl. Even Mark is beinglogical The least you can do isthink about this rationally\\n\\n before you run to Sheriff Akers.\\n\\n The fact is, Mary-Lynnette told herself, brutally honest, that you panicked. You got afeelingaboutthose\\n\\n girls for some reason, and then you forgot logic completely. You didn\u0027t get any kind of hard evidence.\\n\\n You ran away.\\n\\n She could hardly go to the sheriff and. say that shewas suspicious because Rowan had creepy feet.\\n\\n There\u0027s no evidence at all. Nothing except ... She groaned inwardly.\\n\\n \"It all comes down to what\u0027s in the garden,\" shesaid out loud.\\n\\n Mark, who had been walking beside her in frowning silence, now stopped. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"It all comes back to that again,\" Mary-Lynnettesaid, her eyes shut. \"I should have just looked at\\n\\n thatdug-up place when I had the chance, even if Jadesaw me. It\u0027s the only real evidence there is ...so I\u0027ve\\n\\n got to see what\u0027s there.\"\\n\\n Mark was shaking his head. \"Now, look-\"\\n\\n \"I haveto go back. Not tonight. I\u0027m dead tired. But tomorrow. Mark, I haveto check it out before I go\\n\\n to Sheriff Akers.\"\\n\\n Mark exploded.\\n\\n \"Before youwhat?\"he shouted, loud enough to raise echoes. \"What are you talking about, going\\n\\n to the sheriff?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette stared. She hadn\u0027t realized how different Mark\u0027s point of view was from hers. Why, she\\n\\n thought, why he\u0027s ...\\n\\n -240 \"You wanted to check out where Mrs. B. was-so we checked where Mrs. B. was,\" Mark said.\\n\\n \"They told us where. And yousawJade. I know she\u0027s a little differentit\u0027s like you said about Mrs. B.; she\u0027s\\n\\n eccentric. But did she look like the kind of personwho could hurt somebody? Well, didshe?\"\\n\\n Why, he\u0027s in love with her, Mary-Lynnettethought. Or at least seriously in like. Mark likes a girl.\\n\\n Now she was reallyconfused.\\n\\n This could be so good for him-if only the girl weren\u0027t crazy. Well, maybe even if the girl wascrazyif it\\n\\n wasn\u0027t a homicidal craziness. Either way, Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t call the police on Mark\u0027s new girlfriend\\n\\n unless she had some evidence.\\n\\n I wonder if she likes him, too? she thought. They certainly seemed to be protecting each other when I\\n\\n walked in.\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re right,\" she said aloud, glad that she\u0027d had practice lying tonight. \"She doesn\u0027t look\\n\\n like thekind of person who could hurt somebody. I\u0027ll just let it drop.\"\\n\\n With you. And tomorrow night when you thinkI\u0027m starwatching, I\u0027ll sneak over there. This time bringing\\n\\n my own shovel. And maybe a big stick to fend off wolverines.\\n\\n \"Do you really think you heard a wolverine over there?\" she asked, to change the subject.\\n\\n \"Um ...maybe.\" Mark was slowly losing his scowl. \"It was somethingweird. Something I\u0027ve never\\n\\n heard before. So you\u0027re going to forget all this crazy stuff about Mrs. B., right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I am.\" I\u0027ll be safe, mary-Lynnette was thinking. This time I won\u0027t panic, and I\u0027ll make sure\\n\\n they don\u0027t see me. Besides, if they were going to kill me, they would have done it tonight, wouldn\u0027t they?\\n\\n \"Maybe it was Sasquatch we heard yelling,\" Marksaid. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-5.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \\n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
