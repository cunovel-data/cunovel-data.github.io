{"id":82079,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Tiggy.\n She was running. Throwing the door open. Visionsof kittens impaled by tiny stakes in her mind.\n It wasn\u0027t Tiggy on the front porch. It was Ash. He was lying flat in the purple twilight, little moths\n fluttering around him.\n Mary-Lynnette felt a violent wrench in her chest.For a moment everything seemed suspended-and\n changed.\n If Ash were dead-if Ash had been killed ...\n Things would never be all right. She would neverbe all right. It would be like the night with the moonand\n stars gone. Nothing that anybody could do wouldmake up for it. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know why-itdidn\u0027t\n make any sense-but she suddenly knew it was true.\n She couldn\u0027t breathe and her arms and legs felt strange. Floaty. Out of her control.\n Then Ash moved. He lifted his head and pushed up with his arms and looked around.\n Mary-Lynnette could breathe again, but she still felt dizzy. \"Are you hurt?\" she asked stupidly. She didn\u0027t\n dare touch him. In her present state one blast of electricity could fry her circuits forever. She\u0027d meltlike\n the Wicked Witch of the West.\n \"I fell in thishole, \"he said. \"What do you think?\"\n That\u0027s right, Mary-Lynnette thought; the footsteps hadended with more of a crash than a thud. Not like\n the footsteps of last night.\n And that meant something ...if only she couldfollow the thought to the end... .\n \"Having problems, Ash?\"Kestrel\u0027s voice saidsweetly, and then Kestrel herself appeared out of\n the shadows, looking like an angel with her golden hair and her lovely clean features. Jade was behind\n her, holding Tiggy in her arms.\n \"He was up in a tree,\" Jade said, kissing the kitten\u0027s head. \"I had to talk him down.\" Her eyes\n were emerald in the porch light, and she seemed to float rather than walk.\n Ash was getting up, shaking himself. Like his sisters, he looked uncannily beautiful after a feeding,with a\n sort of weird moonlight glow in his eyes. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s thought was long gone.\n \"Come on in,\" she said resignedly. \"And help figure out who killed your aunt.\"\n Now that Ash was indisputably all right,she wanted to forget what she\u0027d been feeling a minuteago. Or at\n least not to think about what it meant.\n What it means, the little voice inside her head said sweetly, is that you\u0027re in big trouble, girl. Ha ha.\n \"So what\u0027s the story?\" Kestrel said briskly as they all sat around the kitchen table.\n \"The story is that there is no story,\"MaryLynnette said. She stared at her paper in frustration.\n \"Look-what if we start at the beginning? We don\u0027t know who did it, but we do know some things about\n them. Right?\"\n Rowan nodded encouragingly. \"Right.\"\n \"First: the goat. Whoever killed the goat had to bestrong, because poking those toothpicks\n through hidewouldn\u0027t have been easy. And whoever killed the goat had to know how your uncle Hodge\n was killed, because the goat was killed in the same way. And they had to have some reason for putting a\n black irisin the goat\u0027s mouth-either because they knew Ashbelonged to the Black Iris Club, or because\n they be longed to the Black Iris Club themself.\"\n \"Or because they thought a black iris would represent all lamia, or all Night People,\" Ash said.\n Hisvoice was muffled-he was bent over, rubbing hisankle. \"That\u0027s a common mistake Outsiders make.\"\n Very good, Mary-Lynnette thought in spite of herself. She said, \"Okay. And they had access to two\n different kinds of small stakes-which isn\u0027t sayingmuch, because you can buy both kinds in town.\"\n \"And they must have had some reason to hate Mrs. B., or to hate vampires,\" Mark said.\n \"Otherwise, why kill her?\"\n Mary-Lynnette gave him a patient look. \"I hadn\u0027t gotten to Mrs. B. yet. But we can do her now. First,\n whoever killed Mrs. B. obviously knew she was a vampire, because they staked her. And, second ...\n um...second . . .\" Her voice trailed off. She couldn\u0027t think of anything to go second.\n -240 \"Second, they probably killed her on impulse,\" Ash said, in a surprisingly calm and analytical\n voice.\"You said she was stabbed with a picket from the fence, and if they\u0027d been planning on doing it,\n they\u0027d probably have brought their own stake.\"\n \"Verygood.\" This time Mary-Lynnette said it out loud. She couldn\u0027t help it. She met Ash\u0027s eyes\n and saw something that startled her. He looked as if itmattered to him that she thought he was smart.\n Well, she thought. Well, well. Here we are, probably for the first time, justtalking to each other. Not\n arguing, not being sarcastic, just talking. It\u0027s nice.\n It was surprisingly nice. And the strange thing was, she knew Ash thought so, too. They understood\n each other. Over the table, Ash gave her a barely perceptible nod.\n They kept talking. Mary-Lynnette lost track of timeas they sat and argued and brainstormed. Finally she\n looked up at the clock and realized with a shock that it was near midnight.\n \"Do wehave to keep thinking?\" Mark said pathetically. \"I\u0027m tired.\" He was almost lying on the\n table. So was Jade.\n I know how you feel, Mary-Lynnette thought. Mybrain is stalled. I feel ... extremely stupid.\n \"Somehow, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to solve the murder tonight,\" Kestrel said. Her eyes were\n closed.\n She was right. The problem was that MaryLynnette didn\u0027t feel like going to bed, either. Shedidn\u0027t want\n to lie down and relax-there was a rest lessness inside her.\n I want ... what do I want? she thought. I want ...\n \"If there weren\u0027t a psychopathic goat killer lurkingaround here, I\u0027d go out and look at the stars,\"\n Ash said, as if it were the most natural thing inthe world, \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\n Kestrel and Jade looked at their brother in disbelief. Rowan bent her head, not quite hiding a smile.\n Mary-Lynnette said, \"Um ...\"\n \"Look,\" Ash said. \"I don\u0027t think the goat killeris lurking out there everyminutelooking for people\n to skewer. And if anything does happen, I can handle it.\" He stopped, looked guilty, then bland. \"I mean\n we can handle it, because there\u0027ll be two of us.\"\n Close but no cigar, buddy, Mary-Lynnette thought. Still, there was a certain basic truth to what he was\n saying. He was strong and fast, and she had the feeling he knew how to fight dirty.\n Even if she\u0027d never seen him do it, she thoughtsuddenly. All those times she\u0027d gone after him, shining light\n in his eyes, kicking him in the shins-and he\u0027d never once tried to retaliate. She didn\u0027t think it had even\n occurred to him.\n She looked at him and said, \"Okay.\"\n \"Now,\" Mark said. \"Look ...\"\n \"We\u0027ll be fine,\" Mary-Lynnette told him. \"We won\u0027t go far.\"\n Mary-Lynnette drove. She didn\u0027t know exactly where she was going, only that she didn\u0027t want to go to\n her hill. Too many weird memories. Despite what she\u0027d told Mark, she found herself taking the car\n farther and farther. Out to where Hazel Green Creek and Beavercreek almost came together and the\n land between them was a good imitation of a rain forest.\n \"Is this the best place to look at - stars?\" Ash saiddoubtfully when they got out of the station\n \"Well-if you\u0027re looking straight up,\" MaryLynnette said. She faced eastward and tilted her head\n far back.\n \"See the brightest star up there? That\u0027s Vega, the queen star of summer.\"\n \"Yeah. She\u0027s been higher in the sky every nightthis summer,\" Ash said without emphasis.\n Mary-Lynnette glanced at him.\n He shrugged. \"When you\u0027re out so much at night,you get to recognize the stars,\" he said. \"Even if you\n don\u0027t know their names.\"\n Mary-Lynnette looked back up at Vega. She swallowed. \"Can you--can you see something small and\n bright below her-something ring-shaped?\"\n \"The thing that looks like a ghost doughnut?\"\n Mary-Lynnette smiled, but only with her lips.\"That\u0027s the Ring Nebula. I can see that with my telescope.\"\n She could feel him looking at her, and she heardhim take a breath as if he were going to say something.\n But then he let the breath out again and looked back up at the stars.\n It was the perfect moment for him to mention something about how Vampires See It Better. And if he\n had, Mary-Lynnette would have turned on him and rejected him with righteous anger.\n But since hedidn\u0027t,she felt a different kind of anger welling up. A spring of contrariness, as if shewere the\n Mary in the nursery rhyme. What, so you\u0027ve decided I\u0027m not good enough to be a vampire or something?\n And what did I really bring you out here for, to the most isolated place I could find? Only for\n starwatching? I don\u0027tthink so.\n I don\u0027t even know who I am anymore, she remembered with a sort of fatalistic gloom. I have the feeling\n I\u0027m about to surprise myself.\n \"Aren\u0027t you getting a crick in your neck?\" Ashsaid.\n Mary-Lynnette rolled her head from side to side slightly to limber the muscles. \"Maybe.\"\n \"I could rub it for you?\" He made the offer from several feet away.\n Mary-Lynnette snorted and gave him a look.\n The moon, a waning crescent, was rising above thecedars to the east. Mary-Lynnette said, \"You want to\n take a walk?\"\n \"Huh? Sure.\"\n They walked and Mary-Lynnette thought. About how it would be to see the Ring Nebula with herown\n eyes, or the Veil Nebula without a filter. She could feel a longing for them so strong it was like a cable\n attached to her chest, pulling her upward.\n Of course,that was nothing new. She\u0027d felt it lots of times before, and usually she\u0027d ended up buying\n another book on astronomy, another lens for her telescope. Anything to bring her closer to what she\n wanted.\n But now I have a whole new temptation. Something bigger and scarier than I ever imagined.\n What if I could be-more than I am now? Thesame . person, but with sharper senses? A Mary-Lynnette\n who couldreally belong to the night?\n She\u0027d already discovered she wasn\u0027t exactly whoshe\u0027d always thought. She was more violent-she\u0027d\n kicked Ash, hadn\u0027t she? Repeatedly. And she\u0027d admired the purity of Kestrel\u0027s fierceness. She\u0027d seenthe\n logic in the kill-or-be-killed philosophy. She\u0027d dreamed about the joy of hunting.\n What else did it take to be a Night Person?\n \"There\u0027s something I\u0027ve been wanting to say toyou,\" Ash said.\n \"Hm.\"Do I want to encourage him or not?\n But what Ash said was \"Can we stop fightingnow?\"\n Mary-Lynnette thought and then said seriously, \"Idon\u0027t know.\"\n They kept walking. The cedars towered around them like pillars in a giant ruined temple. A dark temple.\n And underneath, the stillness was so enormous that Mary-Lynnette felt as if she were walkingon the\n moon.\n She bent and picked a ghostly wildflower that wasgrowing out of the moss. Death camas. Ash bent and\n picked up a broken-off yew branch lying at the footof a twisted tree. They didn\u0027t look at each other.\n They walked, with a few feet of space between them.\n \"You know, somebody told me this would happen,\" Ash said, as if carrying on some entirely\n different conversation they\u0027d been having.\n \"That you\u0027d come to a hick town and chase agoat killer?\"\n \"That someday I\u0027d care for someone - and itwould hurt.\"\n Mary-Lynnette kept onwalking. She didn\u0027t slow or speed up. It was only her heart that was suddenly\n beating hard-in a mixture of dismay and exhilara tion.\n Oh, God-whatever was going to happen washappening.\n \"You\u0027re not like anybody I\u0027ve ever met,\" Ash said.\n \"Well, that feeling is mutual.\"\n Ash stripped some of the papery purple bark offhis yew stick. \"And, you see, it\u0027s difficult becausewhat\n I\u0027ve always thought about humans-what I wasalways raised to think ...\"\n \"I know what you\u0027ve always thought,\" MaryLynnette said sharply. Thinking,vermin.\n \"But,\" Ash continued doggedly, \"the thing is andI know this is going to sound strange-that I seem\n to love you sort of desperately.\" He pulled more bark off his stick.\n Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t look at him. She couldn\u0027t speak.\n \"I\u0027ve done everything I could to get rid of the feeling, but it just won\u0027t go. At first I thought if I left\n Briar Creek, I\u0027d forget it. But now I know that wasinsane. Wherever I go, it\u0027s going with me. I can\u0027t kill it\n off. So I have to think of something else.\"\n Mary-Lynnette suddenly felt extremely contrary. \"Sorry,\" she said coldly. \"But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not very\n flattering to have somebody tell you that they love you against their will, against their reason, and even-\"\n \"Against their character,\" Ash finished for her, bleakly. \"Yeah, I know.\"\n Mary-Lynnette stopped walking. She stared at him.\"You havenot readPrideand Prejudice, \" she said\n flatly.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because Jane Austen was a human.\"\n He looked at her inscrutably and said, \"How do you know?\"\n Good point.Scary point. How could she really knowwho in human history had been human? Whatabout\n Galileo? Newton? T ycho Brahe?\n \"Well, Jane Austen was a woman,\"shesaid, retreating to safer ground. \"And you\u0027re a chauvinist pig-,\u0027\n \"Yes, well, that I can\u0027t argue.\"\n Mary-Lynnette started walking again. He followed.\"So now can I tell you how, um, ardently I loveand\n admire you?\"\n Another quote. \"I thought your sisters said youpartiedall the time.\"\n Ash understood. \"I do,\" he said defensively. \"Butthe morning after partying you have to stay in bed. And\n if you\u0027re in bed you might as well read something\n They walked.\n \"After all, weare soulmates,\" Ash said. \"I can\u0027t becompletely stupid or I\u0027d be completely wrong\n for you.\"\n Mary-Lynnette thought about that. And about thefact that Ash sounded almost-humble. Which he had\n certainly never sounded before.\n She said, \"Ash ...I don\u0027t know. I mean-weare wrong for each other. We\u0027re just basically incompatible.\n Even if I were avampire, we\u0027d be basically incompatible.\"\n \"Well.\" Ash whacked at something with his yew branch. He spoke as if he half expected to be\n ignored.\n \"Well, about that ... I think I couldpossibly change your mind.\"\n \"About what?\"\n \"Being incompatible. I think we could be sort offairly compatible if . . .\"\n \"If?\" Mary-Lynnette said as the silence dragged on.\"Well, if you could bring yourself to kiss me.\"\n \"Kissyou?\"\n \"Yeah, I know it\u0027s a radical concept. I was pretty sure you wouldn\u0027t go for it.\" He whacked at\n another tree. \"Of course humanshave been doing it for thousands of years.\"\n Watching him sideways, Mary-Lynnette said, \"Would you kiss a three-hundred-pound gorilla?\" He\n blinked twice. \"Oh, thank you.\"\"I didn\u0027t mean you looked like one.\"\"Don\u0027t tell me, let me guess. I smell\n like one?\"Mary-Lynnette bit her lip on a grim smile. \"I mean you\u0027re that much stronger than I am. Would\n you kissa female gorilla that could crush you with one squeeze`? When you couldn\u0027t do anything about\n it?\"He glanced at her sideways. \"Well, you\u0027re notexactly in that position, are you?\"\n Mary-Lynnette said, \"Aren\u0027t I? It looks to me as ifI\u0027d have to become a vampire just to deal with youon\n an equal level.\" Ash said, \"Here.\"\n Hewasofferingher theyew branch.Mary Lynnette stared at him.\n \"You want to give me your stick.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a stick, it\u0027s the way to deal withme onan equal level.\" He put one end of the branch\n againstthe base of his throat, and Mary-Lynnette saw that it was sharp.She reached out to take the other\n end and found the stick was surprisingly hard and heavy.\n Ash was looking straight at her. It was too dark to see what color his eyes were, but his expression was\n unexpectedly sober.\n \"One good push would do it,\" he said. \"First here and then in the heart. You could eliminate the\n problem of me from your life.\"\n Mary-Lynnette pushed, but gently. He took a step back. And another. She backed him up against a\n tree, holding the stick to his neck like a sword.\n \"I actually meant only if you were really serious,\"Ash said as he came up short against the cedar\u0027s\n bare trunk. But he didn\u0027t make a move to defend himself.\"And the truth is that you don\u0027t even need a\n spear like that. A pencil in the right place would do it.\"\n Mary-Lynnette narrowed her eyes at him, swirlingthe yew stick over his body like a fencer getting the\n range.\n Then she removed it. She dropped it to the ground. \"You really have changed,\" she said.\n Ash said simply, \"I\u0027ve changed so much in the lastfew days that I don\u0027t even recognize myself in the\n mirror.\"\n \"And you didn\u0027t kill your aunt.\"\"You\u0027re just now figuring that out?\"\n \"No. But I always wondered just a bit. All right, I\u0027ll kiss you.\"\n It was a little awkward, lining up to get the position right. Mary-Lynnette had never kissed a boy before.\n But once she started she found it was simple.\n And... now she saw what the electric feeling ofbeing soulmates was for. All the sensations she\u0027d felt\n when touching his hand, only intensified. And not unpleasant. It was only unpleasant if you were afraidof\n it.\n Afterward, Ash pulled away. \"There. Yousee,\"he said shakily.\n Mary-Lynnette took a few deep breaths. \"I supposethat\u0027s what it feels like to fall into a black hole.\"\n \"Oh. Sorry.\"\n \"No, I mean-it was interesting.\" Singular, shethought. Different from anything she\u0027d ever felt\n before. And she had the feeling thatshe would be different from now on, that she could never go back\n andbe the same person she had been.\n So who am I now? Somebody fierce, I think.Somebody who\u0027d enjoy running through the dark ness,\n underneath stars bright as miniature suns, and maybe even hunt deer. Somebody who can laugh atdeath\n the way the sisters do.\n I\u0027ll discover a supernova and I\u0027ll hiss when somebody threatens me. I\u0027ll be beautiful and scary and\n dangerous and of course I\u0027ll kiss Ash a lot.\n She was giddy, almost soaring with exhilaration.\n I\u0027ve always loved the night, she thought. And I\u0027ll finally belong to it completely.\n \"Mary-Lynnette?\" Ash said hesitantly. \"Did you likeit?\"\n She blinked and looked at him. Focused.\n \"I want you to turn me into a vampire,\" she said.\n It didn\u0027t feel like a jellyfish sting this time. It wasquick and almost pleasant like pressure being released.\n And then Ash\u0027s lips were on her neck, and that wasdefinitely pleasant. Warmth radiated from his mouth.\n Mary-Lynnette found herself stroking the back of his neck and realized that his hair was soft,as nice to\n touch as cat\u0027s fur.\n And his mind...was every color of the spectrum. Crimson and gold, jade and emerald and deep\n violetblue. A tangled thorn-forest of iridescent colors that changed from second to second.\n Mary-Lynnette wasdazzled.\n And half frightened. There was darkness in among those gemlike colors. Things Ash had done in the\n past ... things she could sense he was ashamed of now. But shame didn\u0027t change the acts themselves.\n I know it doesn\u0027t-but I\u0027ll make up for them, somehow.You\u0027ll see; I\u0027ll find away....\n So that\u0027s telepathy, Mary-Lynnette thought. She couldfeel Ash as he said the words, feel that hemeant\n them with desperate earnestness-and feel that there was a lot to make up for.\n I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m going to be a creature of darkness,too. I\u0027ll do what\u0027s in my nature, with no regrets.\n When Ash started to lift his head, she tightened her grip, trying to keep him there.\n \"Please don\u0027t tempt me,\" Ash said out loud, hisvoice husky, his breath warm on her neck. \"If I\n take too much, it will make you seriously weak.I mean it, sweetheart.\"\n She let him go. He picked up the yew stick and made a small cut at the base of his throat, tilting his head\n back like a guy shaving his chin.\n Mary-Lynnette realized he\u0027d never done this before. With a feeling that was. almost awe, she put her lips\n to his neck.\n I\u0027m drinking blood. I\u0027m a hunter already--sort of.\n Anyway, I\u0027m drinking blood and liking it-maybe because it doesn\u0027ttastelike blood Not like copper and\n fear. It tastes weird and magic and old as the stars. When Ash gently detached her, she swayed on her\n feet.\n \"We\u0027d better go home,\" he said.\n \"Why? I\u0027m okay.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to get dizzier-and weaker. And ifwe\u0027re going to finish changingyou into a\n vampire--\"\n \"if\"\n \"All right,when. But before we do, we need to talk. I need to explain it all to you; we have to figure out\n the details. Andyouneed to rest.\"\n Mary-Lynnette knew he was right. She wanted to stay here, alone with Ash in the dark cathedral of the\n forest-but shedidfeel weak. Languid. Apparently it was hard work becoming a creature of darkness.\n They headed back the way they had come. Mary-Lynnette could feel the change inside herself-it was\n stronger than when she\u0027d exchanged blood with the three girls. She felt simultaneously weak and\n hypersensitive. As if every pore were open.\n The moonlight seemed much brighter. She couldsee colors dearly-the pale green of drooping cedar\n boughs, the eerie purple of parrot-beak wildflowersgrowing out of the moss.\n And the forest wasn\u0027t silent anymore. She could hear faint uncanny sounds like the soft seething of\n needles in the wind, and her own footsteps on moist and fungus-ridden twigs.\n I can even smell better, she thought. This place smells like incense cedar, and decomposing plants,and\n something really wild-feral, like something from the zoo. And something hot ...burny ...\n Mechanical. It stung her nostrils. She stopped and looked at Ash in alarm.\n \"Whatisthat?\"\n 0He\u0027d stopped, too. \"Smells like rubber and oil....\" \"Oh, God, thecar, \" Mary-Lynnette said. They\n looked at each other for a moment, then simultane ously turned, breaking into a run.\n It was the car. White smoke billowed from under the closed hood. Mary-Lynnette started to go closer,\n but Ash pulled her back to the side of the road.\"I just want to open the hood-\" \"No. Look. There.\"\n Mary-Lynnette looked-and gasped. Tiny tongues of flame were darting underneath the smoke. licking\n out of the engine.\n \"Claudine always said this would happen,\" shesaid grimly as Ash pulled her back farther, \"Only I\n think she meant it would happen with me in it.\"\n \"We\u0027re going to have to walk home,\" Ash said.\"Unless maybe somebody sees the fire....\"\n \"Not a chance,\" Mary-Lynnette said. And that\u0027swhat you get for taking a boy out to the most\n isolated place in Oregon, her inner voice said triumphantly.\n \"I don\u0027t suppose you could turn into a bat or something and fly back,\" she suggested.\n \"Sorry, I flunked shapeshifting. And I wouldn\u0027t leave you here alone anyway.\"\n Mary-Lynnette still felt reckless and dangerous and it made her impatient.\n \"I can take care of myself,\" she said.\n Andthat was when the club came down and Ash pitched forward unconscious. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-15.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
