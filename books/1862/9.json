Kill them, kill them, kill them.\n Mark laughed In a very strange way.\n This is going to be really rotten for him, MaryLynnette thought, curiously dispassionate. I mean, if we\n were going tolive through this, which we\u0027re not, it would be really rotten for him. He was already afraidof\n girls, and sort of pessimistic about life in general\n \"Why don\u0027t we all sit down?\" Rowan said with astifled sigh. \"We\u0027ve got to figure this out.\"\n Mark threw back his head and gave another shortbark of a laugh.\n \"Why not?\" he said. \"Let\u0027s all sit down, why not?\"\n They\u0027re fast as whippets, Mary-Lynnette thought.If we run now, they\u0027ll catch us. But If we sit, and they\n get comfortable, and I distract them-or hitthem with something...\n \"Sitl\" she ordered Mark briskly. Rowan and Kestrel moved away from the deer and sat. Jade\n stood with her hands on her hips for a moment, then sat,too.\n Sitting, Mark was still acting punch-drunk. Hewaved the flashlight around. \"You girls aresomethingelse.\n You girls are really-\"\n \"We\u0027re vampires,\" Jade said sharply.\n \"Yeah.\" Mark laughed quietly to himself. \"Yeah,\" he said again.\n Mary-Lynnette took the flashlight away from him. She wanted control of it. And it was heavy plastic and\n metal. It was a weapon.\n And while one layer of her mind was thinking:Shine the light in their eyesat just the rightmoment andthen\n hit oneof them; another part was thinking:Shemeans they\u0027repeoplewhothinkthey\u0027re vampires;peoplewith\n that weird disease that makes them anemic; and one final part was saying:Youmight as well faceit;they\u0027re\n real.\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s world view had been knocked rightout of the ballpark.\n \"Don\u0027t you justhate that,\" Mark was saying. \"You meet a girl and she seems pretty nice and you\n tell all your friends and then before you know it she turnsout to be avampire.Don\u0027t you just hate it when\n that happens?\"\n Oh. God, he\u0027s hysterical, Mary-Lynnette realized. She grabbed his shoulder and hissed in his ear, \"Get a\n grip, now.\",\n \"I don\u0027t see what the point is in talking to them,Rowan,\" Kestrel was saying. \"You know what wehave to\n do.\"\n And Rowan was rubbing her forehead. \"I was thinkingwe might influence them,\" she said in an\n undertone.\n \"You know why that won\u0027t work.\" Kestrel\u0027s voice was soft and flat.\n \"Why?\" Jade said sharply.\n \"They followed us for a reason,\" Rowan saidtiredly. She nodded toward the hole. \"So they\u0027ve\n been suspicious for a while-for how long?\" She looked at Mary-Lynnette.\n \"I saw you dig the hole Tuesday night,\" MaryLynnette said. She nodded toward the hole. \"Is that\n your aunt in there?\"\n There was a brief silence and Rowan looked selfconscious. Then she inclined her head slightly.\n Gracefully.\n \"Oh, hell,\" Mark said. His eyes were shut and his head was rolling on his neck. \"Oh,hell. They\u0027ve\n got Mrs. B. in a bag.\"\n \"Two days,\" Rowan said to Jade. \"They\u0027ve suspected for two whole days. And we can\u0027t remove\n memories that are interlaced with other things for that long. We\u0027d never know if we got them all.\"\n \"Well, we could just takeeverything for the last two days,\" Jade said.\n Kestrel snorted. \"And have two more people wandering around with lost time?\"\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind went click. \"Todd Akers andVic Kimble,\" she said. \"You did something to give\n them amnesia.I knew there had to be a connection.\"\n \"There\u0027s no other choice for us,\" Kestrel said quietly to Rowan. \"And you know it as well as I\n do.\"\n She\u0027s not being malicious, Mary-Lynnette realized.Just practical. If a lioness or a wolf or a falcon could\n talk, it would say the same thing. \"We have to either kill or die; it\u0027s as simple as that.\"\n Despite herself, Mary-Lynnette felt something like fascination-and respect.\n Mark had his eyes open now. And Rowan was looking sad, so sad. It\u0027s awful, her expression said, but\n somebody here is going to have to get hurt.\n Rowan bowed her head, then lifted it to face MaryLynnette directly. Their eyes met, held. After a\n moment Rowan\u0027s face changed slightly and she nodded.\n Mary-Lynnette knew that in that instant they werecommunicating without words. Each recognizing the\n other as an alpha female who was willing to fightand die for her kin.\n Meaning they were both big sisters.\n Yes, somebody\u0027s going to get hurt, Mary-Lynnette thought. You threaten myfamily,I fight back.\n She knew Rowan understood. Rowan was going to really hate killing her....\n \"No,\" a voice said passionately, and MaryLynnette realized it was Jade. And the next second\n Jade was on her feet, hands clenched, words erupting like a steam boiler exploding. \"No, youcan\u0027tkill\n Mark. I won\u0027tletyou.\"\n Rowan said, \"Jade, I know this is hard-\"Kestrel said, \"Jade, don\u0027t be a wimp-\"\n Jade was trembling, body tensed like a cat ready to fight. Her voice was louder than either of them.\n \"You just can\u0027t do itl I think -Ithink-\" \"Jade-\"\n \"I thinkhe\u0027s my soulmate!\"\n Dead silence.\n Then Rowan groaned. \"Oh, dear...\"\n Kestrel said, \"Oh,sure.\"\n They were both looking at Jade. Focused on her. Mary-Lynnette thought, now.\n She swung the flashlight viciously at Kestrel, wanting to take her out first, betting that Rowan would stay\n behind if Kestrel were hurt. But the swing never connected, Mark threw himself in front of her, slamming\n into her arm.\n \"Don\u0027t hurt Jade!\"\n Then everything was just a mad tangle. Arms, legs,grasping fingers, kicking feet. Jade and Mark both\n yelling for it to stop. Mary-Lynnette felt the flashlight wrenched out of her hand. She found long hair, got\n hold of it, yanked. Someone kicked her, and pain blossomed in her ribs.\n Then she felt herself being dragged backward Mark was holding her, pulling her away from thefight.\n Jade was lying on top of Kestrel and clutching at Rowan.\n Everybody was panting. Mark was almost crying.\n \"We just can\u0027t do this,\" he said. \"This is terrible.This is all wrong.\"\n Meanwhile Jade was snarling, \"He\u0027s my soulmate,okay?Okay? I can\u0027t do anything with himdead!\"\n \"He\u0027s not your soulmate, idiot,\" Kestrel said in a somewhat muffled voice. She was facedown on the\n carpet of needles. \"When you\u0027re soulmates, it hits you like lightning, and you know that\u0027s the one person\n in the world you were meant to be with. Youdon\u0027tthink you\u0027re soulmates; you just know it\u0027s your destiny\n whether you like it or not.\"\n Somewhere, deep in Mary-Lynnette\u0027s brain, something stirred in alarm. But she had more urgentthings\n to worry about.\n \"Mark, get out of here,\" she said breathlessly. ?Run!?\n Mark didn\u0027t even ease his grip. \"Why do we have to be enemies?\"\n \"Mark, they\u0027re killers .You can\u0027t justify that. They killed their own aunt.\"\n Three faces turned toward her, startled. A half-fullmoon had risen above the trees, and Mary-Lynnette\n could see them clearly.\n \"We didnot!\" Jade said indignantly.\n \"What made you think that?\" Rowan asked.Mary-Lynnette felt her mouth hang open. \"Be cause\n you buried her, for God\u0027s sakel\"\n \"Yes, but we found her dead.\"\n \"Somebody staked her,\" Kestrel said, brushingpine needles out of her golden hair. \"Probably a\n vampire hunter. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d know anything\n about that.\"\n Mark gulped. \"Staked her-with a stake?\"\n \"Well, with a picket from the fence,\" Kestrel said. \"She was already dead?\" Mary-Lynnette said\n toRowan. \"But then why on earth did you bury her\n in the backyard?\"\n \"It would have been disrespectful to leave her in the cellar.\"\n \u0027But why didn\u0027t you have her taken to a cemetery?\"Rowan looked dismayed.\n Jade said, \"Um, you haven\u0027t seen Aunt Opal.\"\n \"She\u0027s not looking so good,\" Kestrel said. \"Kind ofhard and stiff. You might say mummified.\"\n \"It\u0027s what happens to us,\" Rowan said almostapologetically.\n Mary-Lynnette slumped back against Mark, trying to get her new world view into place. Everything was\n whirling.\n \"So... you were just trying to hide her. But ... you did do something to Todd Akers and Vic\n Kim-\"\n \"Theyattackedus,\" Jade interrupted. \"They were thinking very bad things and they pinched our\n arms.\"\n \"They-?\" Mary-Lynnette sat up suddenly. All at once she understood. \"Oh, my God. Those jerks!\"\n Why hadn\u0027t she thought of that? Todd and Vielast year there bad been rumors about them jumping some\n girl from Westgrove. So they\u0027d tried it on these girls, and ...\n Mary-Lynnette gasped and then snorted with half inhaled laughter. \"Oh, no. Oh, I hope you got them\n \"We just bit them a little,\" Rowan said.\n \"I wish I\u0027d been there tosee it.\"\n She was laughing. Rowan was smiling. Kestrel was grinning barbarically. And suddenly Mary-Lynnette\n knew that they weren\u0027t going to fight anymore.\n Everybody took a deep breath and sat back and looked at one another.\n They do look different from normal humans, Mary-Lynnette thought, staring at them in the moonlight. It\u0027s\n so obvious once you know.\n They wereinhumanly beautiful, of course. Rowanwith her soft chestnut hair and sweet face; Kestrelwith\n her feral sleekness and golden eyes; Jade with her delicate features and her hair like starshine. Likethe\n Three Graces, only fiercer.\n \"Okay,\" Rowan said softly. \"We seem to have asituation here. Now we\u0027ve got to figure\n somethingout.\"\n \"We won\u0027t tell on you,\" Mark said. He and Jadewere gazing at each other.\n \"We\u0027ve got Romeo and Juliet on our hands here is what we\u0027ve got,\" Mary-Lynnette said to\n Rowan.\n But Kestrel was speaking to Rowan, too. \"No matterwhatthey promise, how do we know we can be\n lieve them?\"\n Rowan considered, eyes roving around the clearing. Then she let out a long breath and nodded.\n \"There\u0027s only one way,\" she said. \"Blood-tie.\"\n Kestrel\u0027s eyebrowsflew up. \"Oh, really?\"\n \"What is it?\" Mary-Lynnette asked.\n \"A blood-tie?\" Rowan looked helpless. \"Well, it\u0027s akinship ceremony, you know.\" When\n Mary-Lynnette just looked at her, she went on: \"It makes our families related. It\u0027s like, one of our\n ancestors did it with a family of witches.:\u0027\n Witches, Mary-Lynnette thought. Oh ...gosh. Sowitches are real, too. I wonder how many other things\n are real that I don\u0027t know about?\n \"Vampires don\u0027t usually get along with witches,\" Rowan was saying. \"And HunterRedfern-that\u0027s our\n ancestor-had a real blood feud going with themback in the sixteen hundreds.\"\n \"But then he couldn\u0027t have kids,\" Jade said gleefully. \"And he needed a witch to help or the\n wholeRedfern familywould end with him. So he had to apologize and do a kinship ceremony. And then\n he had all daughters.Ha ha.\"\n Mary-Lynnette blinked. Ha ha?\n \"So, you see, we\u0027re part witch. All the Redfern are,\" Rowan was explaining in her gentle teachingvoice.\n \"Our father used to say that\u0027s why we\u0027re so disobedient,\" Jade said. \"Because it\u0027s in our genes .\n Because in witchfamilies, womenare in charge.\"\n Mary-Lynnette began to like witches. \"Ha ha,\" shesaid. Mark gave her a skittish sideways look.\n \"The point is that we could do a ceremony like that now,\" Rowan said. \"It would make us family\n forever. We couldn\u0027t betray each other.\"\n \"No problem,\" Mark said, still looking at Jade.\n \"Fine with me,\"Jade said, and gave him a quick, fierce smile.\n But Mary-Lynnette was thinking. It was a serious thing Rowan was talking about. You couldn\u0027t do\n something like this on a whim. It was worse than adopting a puppy; it was more like getting married. It\n was a lifetimeresponsibility. And even if these girls didn\u0027t kill humans, they killed animals. With their teeth.\n But so did people. And not always for food. Wasit worse to drink deer blood than to make baby cows\n into boots?\n Besides, strange as it seemed, she felt dose to the three sisters already. In the last couple of minutesshe\u0027d\n established more of a relationship with Rowanthan she ever had with any girl at school. Fascination and\n respect had turned into a weird kind of instinctive trust.\n And besidethat, what other real choice was there? Mary-Lynnette looked at mark, and then atRowan.\n She nodded slowly.\n \"Okay.\"\n Rowan turned to Kestrel.\n \"So I\u0027m supposed to decide, am I?\" Kestrel said.\"We can\u0027t do it without you,\" Rowan said. \"You\n know that.\"\n Kestrel looked away. Her golden eyes were narrowed. In the moonlight her profile was absolutely\n perfect against the darkness of trees. \"It would mean we could never go home again. Make ourselves kin\n to vermin? That\u0027s what they\u0027dsay.\"\n \"Who\u0027s vermin?\" Mark said, jolted out of his communion with Jade.\n Nobody answered. Jade said, with odd dignity, \"Ican\u0027t go home, anyway. I\u0027m in love with an Outsider.\n And I\u0027m going to tell him about the Night World. SoI\u0027m dead no matter what.\" Mark was opening his\n mouth-to protest that Jade shouldn\u0027t take such arisk forhim,Mary-Lynnette thought-when Jade added\n absently, \"And so is he, of course.\"\n Mark shut his mouth.\n Rowan said \"Kestrel, we\u0027ve come too far to go back.\"\n Kestrel stared at the forest for another minute orso. Then suddenly she turned back to the others,\n laughing. There was something wild in her eyes.\n \"All right, let\u0027s go the whole way,\" she said. \"Tell them everything. Break every rule. We might as\n well.\"\n Mary-Lynnette felt a twinge. She hoped she wasn\u0027tgoing to regret this. But what she said was \"Just how\n do we do this-ceremony?\"\n \"Exchange blood. I\u0027ve never done it before, but it\u0027s simple.\"\n \"It might be a little bit strange, though,\" Jade said \"because you\u0027ll be a little bit vampires\n afterward.\"\n \"A little bit what?\" Mary-Lynnette said, her voice rising in spite of her.\n \"Just a little bit.\" Jade was measuring out tiny bitsof air between her index finger and thumb. \"A\n drop.\"\n Kestrel cast a look skyward. \"It\u0027ll go away in a few days,\" she said heavily, which was what\n MaryLynnette wanted to know.\n \"As long as you don\u0027t get yourself bitten by a vampire again in the meanwhile,\" Rowan added.\n \"Otherwise, it\u0027s perfectly safe. Honestly.\"\n Mary-Lynnette and Mark exchanged glances. Not to discuss things, they\u0027d gone beyond that now. Just\n to brace themselves. Then Mary-Lynnette took a deep breath and flicked a bit of fern off her knee.\n \"Okay,\" she said, feeling lightheaded but determined. \"We\u0027re ready.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-9.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
