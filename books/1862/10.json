She was\\n\\n thinking of the way the deer had screamed. But thepain wasn\u0027t so bad. It went away almost immediately.\\n\\n She could feel warmth at her neck as the bloodflowed, and, after a minute, a slight dizziness. A\\n\\n weakness. But the most Interesting thing was that allat once she seemed to have a new sense. She could\\n\\n sense Rowan\u0027s mind.It was like seeing, but withouteyes-and using different wavelengths than visual light.\\n\\n Rowan\u0027s mind-her presence-was warmred, like glowing embers in a campfire. It was alsofuzzy and\\n\\n rounded like a ball of hot gas floatingIn space.\\n\\n Is this what psychics mean when they talk aboutpeople having an aura?\\n\\n Then Rowan pulled back, and it was over. The new sense disappeared.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s fingers went automatically to herneck. She felt wetness there. A little tenderness.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t fool with it,\" Rowan said, brushing at herlips with her thumb. \"It\u0027ll go away in just a\\n\\n minute.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette blinked, feeling languid. She lookedover at Mark, who was being released by Kestrel.\\n\\n He looked okay, if a little dazed. She smiled at him\u0027and he raised his eyebrows and shook his head\\n\\n slightly.\\n\\n I wonder what his mind looks like, Mary-Lynnettethought. Then she said, startled, \"What are you\\n\\n doing?\"\\n\\n Rowan had picked up a twig and was testing itsend for sharpness.\\n\\n \"Every species has some substance that\u0027s harmfulto it,\" she said. \"Silver for werewolves, iron for\\n\\n witches...and wood for vampires. It\u0027s the onlything out here that will cut our skin,\" she added.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean that. I meantwhy, \" Mary-Lynnettesaid, but she knew why already. She watched\\n\\n rednessbead in the wake of the twig as Rowan drew it across her wrist.\\n\\n Exchange blood, Rowan had said.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette gulped. She didn\u0027t look at markand Kestrel.\\n\\n I\u0027ll do it first and then he\u0027ll see it\u0027s not so bad, shetold herself. I can do this, I can do this.... It\u0027s so wecan\\n\\n stayalive.\\n\\n Rowan was looking at her, offering her wrist.\\n\\n Copperbloodfear, Mary-Lynnette thought, feeling queasy.\\n\\n She shut her eyes and put her mouth to Rowan\u0027swrist.\\n\\n Warmth. Well-being. And a taste not like copper, but like something rich and strange. Later, she\u0027d al\\n\\n ways grope for ways to describe it, but she could onlythink of things like: well, a little bit like the way\\n\\n vanilla bean smells, and a little bit like the way silk feels, and a little bit like the way a waterfall looks. It\\n\\n was faintly sweet.\\n\\n Afterward, she felt as if she could run up mountains.\\n\\n \"Oh, boy,\" Mark said, sounding giddy. \"If you could bottle that stuff, you\u0027d make millions.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been thought of before,\" Kestrel said coolly. \"Humans hunting us for our blood.\"\\n\\n \"Talk later,\" Rowan said firmly. \"Blood-tie now.\"\\n\\n Kestrel\u0027s mind was gold. With brilliant knifelikeedges sending glitters in every direction.\\n\\n \"Okay, Jade,\" Rowan said. \"Mark. Enough, you guys. Let go of each other now.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette saw that she was physically pullingMark and Jade apart. Mark was wearing a silly smile,\\n\\n and Mary-Lynnette felt the tiniest stab of envy. What would it be like to see the mind of somebody you\\n\\n were in love with?\\n\\n Jade\u0027s mind was silver and lacy, an intricate filigreed sphere like a Christmas ornament. And by the time\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette sat back from drinking Jade\u0027s blood, she felt light-headed and sparkling. As if she had a\\n\\n mountain stream in her veins.\\n\\n \"All right,\" Rowan said. \"Now we share the sameblood.\" She held out a hand, and Jade and\\n\\n Kestrel did the same. Mary-Lynnette glanced at Mark, then they each reached out, all their hands\\n\\n meeting like spokes in a wheel.\\n\\n \"We promise to be kin to you, to protect and defend you always,\" Rowan said. She nodded to\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette.\\n\\n \"We promise to be kin to you,\" Mary-Lynnetterepeated slowly. \"To protect and defend you\\n\\n always.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" Rowan said simply. \"We\u0027re family.\"\\n\\n Jade said, \"Let\u0027s go home.\"\\n\\n They had to finish burying Aunt Opal first. MaryLynnette watched as Rowan scattered pine needles over\\n\\n the grave.\\n\\n \"You inherit our blood feuds, too,\" Kestrel told Mary-Lynnette pleasantly. \"Meaning you have to\\n\\n help us find out who killed her.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to do that all along.\"\\n\\n They left the deer where it was. Rowan said,\"There are already lots of scavengers around here. It won\u0027t\\n\\n be wasted.\"\\n\\n Yep, that\u0027s life, Mary-Lynnette thought as they leftthe clearing. She glanced behind her-and for justan\\n\\n instant she thought she saw a shadow there anda glint of greenish-orange eyes at her own eye level. It\\n\\n was much too big for a coyote.\\n\\n She opened her mouth to tell the others ... and the shadow was gone.\\n\\n Did I imagine that? I think my eyes are goingfunny. Everything seems too bright.\\n\\n All her senses seemed changed-sharpened. Itmade it easier to get out of the woods than it had been\\n\\n getting in. Mark and Jade didn\u0027t walk hand inhand-that would have been impractical-but Jade looked\\n\\n back at him frequently. And when they got to rough spots, they helped each other.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re happy, aren\u0027t you?\" Mary-Lynnette said softly when she found herself beside Mark.\\n\\n He gave a startled, sheepish grin, white in the moonlight. \"Yeah. I guess I am.\" After a minute hesaid,\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like-I don\u0027t know how to describe it, butit\u0027s like I belong with Jade. She reallysees me. I mean, not\\n\\n the outside stuff. She sees me inside,andshe likes me. Nobody else has ever done that .. .except you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m happy for you.\"\\n\\n \"Listen,\" he said. \"I think we should start looking around for you. There are lots of guys around\\n\\n here-\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette snorted. \"Mark. If I want to meeta guy, I\u0027ll meet a guy. I don\u0027t need any help.\"\\n\\n He gave the sheepish grin again. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n But Mary-Lynnette was thinking. Ofcourseshe\u0027d like to find somebody who would accept her\\n\\n completely, who would share everything with her. That was everybody\u0027s dream. But for how many\\n\\n people did it come true?\\n\\n And there weren\u0027tlots of guys around here....She found herself thinking of Jeremy Lovett again. His dear\\n\\n brown eyes ...\\n\\n But she couldn\u0027t hold the picture. It kept dissolving--.to her horror-into eyes that flashed blue andgold\\n\\n and gray, depending on the way they caught the light.\\n\\n Oh, God,no. Ash was the last person who would understand her. And she didn\u0027t want to share a bus\\n\\n seat with him, much less her life.\\n\\n \"What I want to know is who madeyou guys vam pires,\" Mark said. They were sitting on oversize,\\n\\n overstuffed Victorian furniture in the living room at Burdock Farm. Rowan had a fire going in the\\n\\n fireplace. \"Was it the old lady? Your aunt?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t anybody,\" Jade said, looking affronted.\"We\u0027re not made vampires. We\u0027re the lamia.\"\\n\\n She pronounced it LAY-mee-uh.\\n\\n Mark looked at her sideways. \"Uh-huh. Andwhat\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s us. It\u0027s vampires that can have babies, and eat,and drink, and get old if we let ourselves, and\\n\\n livein families.Thebest kind of vampires.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a race of vampires, basically,\" Kestrel said.\"Look, there are two different kinds of vampires,\\n\\n okay? The kind who start out as humans and are changed when a vampire bites them, and the kindthat\\n\\n are bornvampires. That\u0027s the kind we are. Our line goes back-well, let\u0027s say a long way.\"\\n\\n \"The longest,\" Jade broke in again. \"We\u0027re Redferns; we go back to prehistoric times.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette blinked. \"But you three don\u0027t go back that far, do you?\" she said nervously.\\n\\n Rowan stifled a laugh. \"I\u0027m nineteen; Kestrel\u0027s seventeen; Jade is sixteen. We haven\u0027t stopped aging\\n\\n yet.\"\\n\\n Kestrel was looking at Mary-Lynnette. \"How olddid our aunt look to you?\"\"Um, around seventy,\\n\\n seventy-five, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"When we last saw her she looked maybe forty,\" Kestrel said. \"That was ten years ago, when\\n\\n she left our island.\"\\n\\n \"But she\u0027d actually been alive for seventy-four years at that point,\" Rowan said. \"That\u0027s what\\n\\n happens to us-if we stop holding off the aging process, it all catches up at once.\"\\n\\n \"Which if you\u0027ve been alive for five or six hundredyears can be quite interesting,\" Kestrel said\\n\\n dryly.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette said, \"So this island where youcome from-is that the Night World?\"\\n\\n Rowan looked startled. \"Oh, no, it\u0027s just a safe town. You know, a place where our people all live\\n\\n without any humans. Hunter Redfern founded itback in the sixteenth century so we\u0027d have some where\\n\\n safe to live.\"\\n\\n \"The only problem,\" Kestrel said, golden eyesglinting, \"is that people there are still doing thingsthe\\n\\n way they did in the sixteenth century. Andthey made a rule that nobody couldleave-exceptfor some of the\\n\\n men and boys that they trusted completely.\"\\n\\n Like Ash, I guess, Mary-Lynnette thought. Shewas about to say this, but Rowan was speakingagain.\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s why we ran away. We didn\u0027t want tohave to get married when our father told us to.\\n\\n Wewanted to see the human world. We wanted-\"\\n\\n \"To eat junk food,\" Jade caroled. \"And read magazines and wear pants and watch TV.\"\\n\\n \"When Aunt Opal left the island, she didn\u0027t tell anybody where she was going-except me,\"\\n\\n Rowan said. \"She told me she was going to this little town called Briar Creek where her husband\u0027s family\\n\\n had built a house a hundred and fifty years ago.,,,\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette ran her fingers through the silky tassels of a forest-green pillow. \"Okay, but-whereis the\\n\\n Night World, then?\"\\n\\n \"Oh... it\u0027s not a place....\" Rowan looked uncertain. \"This is-it\u0027s kind of hard to tell you, actually,\"\\n\\n she said. \"You\u0027re not even supposed to know it exists. The two very first laws of the Night World are\\n\\n that you never let a human find out about it ...and that you never fall in love with a human.\"\\n\\n \"And Jade\u0027s breaking both this minute,\" Kestrel murmured.\\n\\n Jade just looked pleased.\\n\\n \"And the penalty for both is death-for everybody involved,\" Rowan said. \"But . . . you\u0027re family.\\n\\n Here goes.\" She took a steadying breath. \"The Night World is a sort of secret society. Not just of\\n\\n vampires. Of witches and werewolves and shape shifters, too. All the different kinds of Night People.\\n\\n We\u0027re everywhere.\"\\n\\n Everywhere?Mary-Lynnette thought. It was an unnerving idea-but an interesting one. So therewas a\\n\\n whole world out there she\u0027d never knownabout-a place to explore, as alien as the Androm eda galaxy.\\n\\n Mark didn\u0027t seem too disturbed by the thought of vampires everywhere. He was grinning at Jade, leaning\\n\\n with one elbow on the arm of the dark green couch. \"So, can you read minds? Can you read my mind\\n\\n right now?\"\\n\\n cats who have heard something theirhumanscan\u0027t. An instant later, though. Mary-Lynnette heard it, too.\\n\\n The sound of feet on the front porch--tap, tap,tap-asquick as that. And then a thud.\\n\\n \"Hey, somebody\u0027sout there,\" Jade said, and before Mark could stop her, she was up and\\n\\n heading for the door.\\n\\n \"Soulmates can read each other\u0027s minds without even trying,\" Jade told Mark firmly.\\n\\n Soulmates ... Mary-Lynnette wanted to get on toa different subject. She felt uncomfortable, tingly.\\n\\n \"I wish you\u0027d stop saying that. What you have ismuch better than being soulmates,\" Rowan was tell\\n\\n ing Jade. \"With love you get to find out about aperson first. Being soulmates is involuntary-youdon\u0027t even\\n\\n have tolikethe person when you meetthem. They may be completely wrong for you inevery way-wrong\\n\\n species, wrong temperament, wrong age. But you know you\u0027ll never be completely happy again without\\n\\n them.\"\\n\\n More and more tingly. Mary-Lynnette had to say something. \"And what if thathappenedto you-if you\\n\\n found somebody and you were soulmates with them and you didn\u0027t want to be?\" she asked Rowan. She\\n\\n realized that her voice was strange--thick. \"Isn\u0027tthere any way you could-get rid of it?\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Mary-Lynnette saw everyoneturn to look at her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never heard of one,\" Rowan said slowly. Her brown eyes were searching Mary-Lynnette\u0027s.\\n\\n \"But I guess you could ask a witch ... if you had that problem.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette swallowed. Rowan\u0027s eyes weregentle and friendly-and Mary-Lynnette felt a very strong\\n\\n need to talk to someone, someone who would understand.\\n\\n \"Rowan\\n\\n She didn\u0027t get any further. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade all looked suddenly toward the front door-like. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-10.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \\n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
