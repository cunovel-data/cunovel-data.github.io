{"id":82068,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"She\u0027s not looking so good,\" Kestrel said, peering over Rowan\u0027s shoulder.\n Rowan said, \"Oh,dear,\" and sat down\n Great-aunt Opal was a mummy. Her skin was like leather: yellow-brown, hard, and smooth. Almost\n shiny. And the skin was all there was to her, just a leathery frame stretched over bones. She didn\u0027t have\n any hair. Her eye sockets were dark holes with dry tissue inside. Her nose was collapsed.\n \"Poor auntie,\" Rowan said. Her own brown eyes were wet.\n \"We\u0027re going to look like that when we die,\" Kestrel said musingly.\n Jade stamped her foot. \"No, look,you guys! You\u0027re both missing it completely. Look atthat!\" She swung\n a wild toe at the mummy\u0027s midsection. There, protruding from the blue-flowered housedress and the\n leathery skin, was a gigantic splinter of wood. It was almost as long as an arrow, thick at the base and\n tapered where it disappeared into Aunt Opal\u0027s chest. Flakes of white paint still clung to one side.\n Several other pickets were lying on the cellar floor.\n \"Poor old thing,\" Rowan said. \"She must havebeen carrying them when she fell.\"\n Jade looked at Kestrel. Kestrel looked back withexasperated golden eyes. There were few things they\n agreed on, but Rowan was one of them.\n \"Rowan,\" Kestrel said distinctly, \"she wasstaked. \"\n \"Oh, no.\"\n \"Oh, yes,\" Jade said. \"Somebody killed her. And somebody who knew she was a vampire.\"\n Rowan was shaking her head. \"But who would know that?\"\n \"Well ...\" Jade thought. \"Another vampire.\"\n \"Or a vampirehunter,\"Kestrel said.\n Rowan looked up, shocked. \"Those aren\u0027t real.They\u0027re just stories to frighten kids-aren\u0027t they?\"\n Kestrel shrugged, but her golden eyes were dark.\n Jade shifted uneasily. The freedom she\u0027d felt on the road, the peace in the living room-and now this.\n Suddenly she felt empty and isolated.\n Rowan sat down on the stairs, looking too tired and preoccupied to push back the lock of hair plastered\n to her forehead. \"Maybe I shouldn\u0027t havebrought you here,\" she said softly. \"Maybe it\u0027s worsehere.\" She\n didn\u0027t say it, but Jade could sense her next thought. Maybe we should go back\n \"Nothingcould be worse,\" Jade said fiercely. \"And I\u0027d die before I\u0027d go back.\" She meant it. Back to\n waiting on every man in sight? Back to arranged marriages and endless restrictions? Back to all those\n disapproving faces, so quick to condemn anything different, anything that wasn\u0027t done the way it had\n been done four hundred years ago?\n \"Wecan\u0027t go back,\" she said.\n \"No, we can\u0027t,\" Kestrel said dryly. \"Literally. Unless we want to end up like Great-aunt Opal.\n Or\"she paused significantly-\"like Great-uncle Hodge.\"\n Rowan looked up. \"Don\u0027t even say that!\"\n Jade\u0027s stomach felt like a clenched fist. \"They wouldn\u0027t, she said, shoving back at the memory that was\n trying to emerge. \"Not to their own grandkids. Not to us.\"\n \"The point,\" Kestrel said, \"is that we can\u0027t go back,so we have to go forward. We\u0027ve got to\n figure out what we\u0027re going to do here without Aunt Opal tohelp us--especially if there\u0027s a vampire hunter\n around. But first, what are we going to do withthat?\" She nodded toward the body.\n Rowan just shook her head helplessly. She lookedaround the cellar as if she might find an answer in a\n comer. Her gaze fell on Jade. It stopped there, and Jade could see the sisterly radar system turn on.\n \"Jade. What\u0027s that in your jacket?\"\n Jade was too wrung-out to lie. She opened thejacket and showed Rowan the kittens. \"I didn\u0027t know my\n suitcase would kill them.\"\n Rowan looked too wrung-out to be angry. She glanced heavenward, sighing. Then, looking back atJade\n sharply: \"But why were you bringing them downhere?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t. I was just looking for a shovel. I was going to bury them in the backyard.\"\n There was a pause. Jade looked at her sisters and they looked at each other. Then all three of them\n looked at the kittens.\n Then they looked at Great-aunt Opal.\n Mary-Lynnette was crying.\n It was a beautiful night, a perfect night. An inversion layer was keeping the air overhead still and warm,\n and the seeing was excellent. There was very little light pollution and no direct light. The Victorian\n farmhouse just below Mary-Lynnette\u0027s hill wasmostly dark. Mrs. Burdock was always very consider ate\n about that.\n Above, the Milky Way cut diagonally across the sky like a river. To the south, where Mary-Lynnette\n had just directed her telescope, was the constellation Sagittarius, which always looked. more like a\n teapot than like an archer to her. And just above the spout of the teapot was a faintly pink patch of what\n looked like steam.\n It wasn\u0027t steam. It was clouds of stars. A star factory called the Lagoon Nebula. The dust and gas of\n dead stars was being recycled into hot young stars, just being born.\n It was four thousand and five hundred light-years away. And she was looking at it, right this minute. A\n seventeen-year-old kid with a second-hand Newtonian reflector telescope was watching the light of stars\n being born.\n Sometimes she was filled with so much awe andand-and-and longing-that she thought she might break to\n pieces.\n Since there was nobody else around, she could let the tears roll down her cheeks without pretending it\n was an allergy. After a while she had to sit back and wipe her nose and eyes on the shoulder of her\n T-shirt.\n Oh, come on, give it a rest now, she told herself.You\u0027re crazy, you know.\n She wished she hadn\u0027t thought of Jeremy earlier. Because now, for some reason, she kept picturinghim\n the way he\u0027d looked that night when he came to watch the eclipse with her. His level brown eyes had\n held a spark of excitement, as if he really cared about what he was seeing. As if, for that moment,\n anyway, he understood.\n I have been one acquainted with the night, amaudlin little voice inside her chanted romantically, trying to\n get her to cry again.\n Yeah, right, Mary-Lynnette told the voice cynically. She reached for the bag of Cheetos she kept under\n her lawn chair. It was impossible to feel romantic and overwhelmed by grandeur while eating Cheetos.\n Saturn next, she thought, and wiped sticky orangecrumbs off her fingers. It was a good night for Saturn\n because its rings were just passing through theiredgewise position.\n She had to hurry because the moon was rising at 11:16. But before she turned her telescope toward\n Saturn, she took one last look at the Lagoon. Actuallyjust to the east of the Lagoon, trying to make out\n the open cluster of fainter stars she knew was there.\n She couldn\u0027t see it. Her eyes just weren\u0027t good enough. If she had a bigger telescope-if she lived inChile\n where the air was dry-if she could get above the earth\u0027s atmosphere . . . then she might have a chance.\n But for now . . . she was limited by the human eye. Human pupils just didn\u0027t open farther than 9\n millimeters.\n Nothing to be done about that.\n She was just centering Saturn in the field of viewwhen a light went on behind the farmhouse below. Not\n a little porch light. A barnyard vapor lamp. Itilluminated the back property of the house like a searchlight.\n Mary-Lynnette sat back, annoyed. It didn\u0027t reallymatter-she could see Saturn anyway, see the rings that\n tonight were just a delicate silver line cutting across the center of the planet. But it was strange.Mrs.\n Burdock never turned the back light on at night.\n The girls, Mary-Lynnette thought. The nieces. Theymust have gotten there and she must be giving them a\n tour. Absently she reached for her binoculars. Shewas curious.\n They were good binoculars, Celestron Ultimas,sleek and lightweight. She used them for looking at\n everything from deep sky objects to the craters on the moon. Right now, they magnified the back of Mrs.\n Burdock\u0027s house ten times.\n She didn\u0027t see Mrs. Burdock, though. She could seethe garden. She could see the shed and the\n fenced-in area where Mrs. Burdock kept her goats. And shecould see three girls, all well illuminated by\n the vapor lamp. One had brown hair, one had golden hair, and one had hair the color of Jupiter\u0027s rings.\n That silvery.Like starlight. They were carrying something wrapped in plastic between them. Black plastic.\n Hefty garbage bags, if Mary-Lynnette wasn\u0027t mistaken.\n Now, what on earth were they doing with that?\n Burying it.\n The short one with the silvery hair had a shovel. She was a good little digger, too. In a few minutesshe\n had rooted up most of Mrs. Burdock\u0027s irises. Then the medium-sized one with the golden hairtook a turn,\n and last of all the tall one with the brown hair.\n Then they picked up the garbage-bagged objecteven though it was probably over five feet long, it\n seemed very light-and put it in the hole they\u0027d just made.\n They began to shovel dirt back into the hole.\n No, Mary-Lynnette told herself. No, don\u0027t be ridiculous. Don\u0027t be insane. There\u0027s some mundane, per\n fectly commonplace explanation for this.\n The problem was, she couldn\u0027t think of any.\n No, no, no. This is notRear Window,we are not in the Twilight Zone. They\u0027re just burying-something.\n Some sort of ... ordinary ...\n What else besides a dead body was five-feet-andsome-odd-inches long, rigid, and needed to be\n wrapped in garbage bags before burial?\n And, Mary-Lynnette thought, feeling a rush ofadrenaline that made her heart beat hard. And.\n And...\n Where was Mrs. Burdock?\n The adrenaline was tingling painfully in herpalms\n and feet. It made her feel out of control, which she hated. Her hands were shaking so badly she had to\n lower the binoculars.\n Mrs. B.\u0027s okay. She\u0027s all right. Things like thisdon\u0027thappenin real life.\n What would Nancy Drew do?\n Suddenly, in the middle of her panic, MaryLynnette felt a tiny giggle try to escape like a burp. Nancy\n Drew, of course, would hike right down there and investigate. She\u0027d eavesdrop on the girls from behind a\n bush and then dig up the garden once they went back inside the house.\n But things like that didn\u0027t happen. Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t even imagine trying to dig up a neighbor\u0027s\n garden in the dead of night. She would get caught and it would be a humiliating farce. Mrs. Burdock\n would walk out of the house alive and alarmed, and Mary-Lynnette would dieof embarrassment trying to\n explain.\n In a book that might be amusing. In real life-she didn\u0027t even want to think about it.\n One good thing, it made her realize how absurd her paranoia was. Deep down, she obviously knew\n Mrs. B. was just fine. Otherwise, she wouldn\u0027t besitting here; she\u0027d be calling the police, like any sensi ble\n person.\n Somehow, though, she suddenly felt tired. Not up to more starwatching. She checked her watch by the\n ruby glow of a red-filtered flashlight. Almost eleven-well, it was all over in sixteen minutes anyway. When\n the moon rose it would bleach out the sky.\n But before she broke down her telescope for the trip back, she picked up the binoculars again. Just one\n last look.\n The garden was empty. A rectangle of fresh darksoil showed where it had been violated. Even as\n Mary-Lynnette watched, the vapor lamp went out.\n It wouldn\u0027t do any harm to go over there tomorrow, Mary-Lynnette thought. Actually, I was goingto,\n anyway. I should welcome those girls to the neighborhood. I should return those pruning shears Dad\n borrowed and the knife Mrs. B. gave me to get my gas cap off. And of course I\u0027ll see Mrs. B. there, and\n then I\u0027ll know everything\u0027s okay.\n Ash reached the top of the winding road andstopped to admire the blazing point of light in the south.\n You really could see more from these isolated\n country towns. From here Jupiter, the king of the planets, looked like a UFO.\n \"Where have you been?\" a voice nearby said. \"I\u0027vebeen waiting for you for hours.\"\n Ash answered without turning around. \"Wherehave I been? Where have you been? We were supposed\n to meet onthat hill, Quinn.\" Hands in his pockets, he pointed with an elbow.\n \"Wrong. It was this hill and I\u0027ve been sitting righthere waiting for you the entire time. But forget it.\n Are they here or aren\u0027t they?\"\n Ash turned and walked unhurriedly to the open convertible that was parked just beside the road, itslights\n off. He leaned one elbow on the door, looking down. \"They\u0027re here. I told you they would be. It was the\n only place for them to go.\"\n \"All three of them?\"\n \"Of course, all three of them. My sisters always stick together.\"\n Quinn\u0027s lip curled. \"Lamia are so wonderfully family oriented.\"\n \"And made vampires are so wonderfully . . . short,\" Ash said serenely, looking at the sky again.\n Quinn gave him a look like black ice. His e-mail, compact body was utterly still inside the car. \"Well,\n now, I never got to finish growing, did I?\" he saidvery softly. \"One of your ancestors took care of that.\"\n Ash boosted himself to sit on the hood of the car,long legs dangling. \"I think I may stop aging this year\n myself,\" he said blandly, still looking down the slope. \"Eighteen\u0027s not such a bad age.\"\n \"Maybe not if you have a choice,\" Quinn said, his voice still as soft as dead leaves falling. \"Try\n beingeighteen for four centuries-with no end in sight.\"\n Ash turned to smile at him again. \"Sorry. On my family\u0027s behalf.\"\n \"And I\u0027m sorry for your family. The Redferns have been having a little trouble lately, haven\u0027t they?\n Let\u0027s see if I\u0027ve got it right. First your uncle Hodge breaks Night World law and is appropriately\n punished-\"\n \"My great-uncle by marriage,\" Ash interrupted in polite tones, holding one finger up. \"He was a\n Burdock, not a Redfern. And that was over ten years ago.\"\n \"And then your aunt Opal-\"\n \"Mygreat-auntOpal-\"\n \"Disappears completely. Breaks off all contact withthe Night World. Apparently because she prefers\n living in the middle of nowhere with humans.\"\n Ash shrugged, eyes fixed on the southern horizon. \"It must be good hunting in the middle of nowhere\n with humans. No competition. And no Night Worldenforcement-no Elders putting a limit on how many\n you can bag.\"\n \"And no supervision,\" Quinn said sourly. \"Itdoesn\u0027t matter so much thatshe\u0027s been living here, but\n she\u0027s obviously been encouraging your sisters to join her. You should have informed on them whenyou\n found out they were writing to each other secretly.\"\n Ash shrugged, uncomfortable. \"It wasn\u0027t againstthe law. I didn\u0027t know what they had in mind.\"\n \"It\u0027s not just them,\" Quinn said in his disturbingly soft voice. \"You know there are rumors about\n that cousin of yours-James Rasmussen. People are saying that he fell in love with a human girl. That she\n was dying and he decided to change her withoutpermission. . . .\"\n Ash slid off the hood and straightened. \"I never listen to rumors,\" he said, briskly and untruthfully.\n \"Besides, that\u0027s not the problem right now, is it?\"\n \"No. The problem is your sisters and the mess they\u0027re in. And whether you can really do what\u0027s\n necessary to dean it up.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Quinn. I can handle it.\"\n \"ButI doworry, Ash. I don\u0027t know how I let you talk me into this.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t. You lost that game of poker.\"\n \"And you cheated.\" Quinn was looking off into a middle distance, his dark eyes narrowed, his\n moutha straight line. \"I still think we should tell the Elders ,\" he said abruptly. \"It\u0027s the only way to\n guarantee a really thorough investigation.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see why it needs to be so thorough.They\u0027ve only been here a few hours.\"\n \"Your sisters have only been here a few hours.Your aunt has been here-how long? Ten years?\"\n \"What have you got against my aunt, Quinn?\"\n \"Her husband was a traitor. She\u0027s a traitor now for encouraging those girls to run away. And who\n knowswhat she\u0027s been doing here in the last ten years? Who knows how many humans she\u0027s told about\n the Night World?\"\n Ash shrugged, examining his nails. \"Maybe she hasn\u0027t told any.\"\n \"And maybe she\u0027s told the whole town.\"\n \"Quinn,\" Ash said patiently, speaking as if to avery young child, \"if my aunt has broken the laws\n of the Night World, she has to die. For the family honor. Any blotch on that reflects onme.\"\n \"That\u0027s one thing I can count on,\" Quinn said halfunder his breath. \u0027,\u0027Your self-interest. You\n always look after Number One, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t everybody?\"\n \"Not everybody is quite so blatant about it.\" There was a pause, then Quinn said, \"And what\n about your sisters?\"\n \"What about them?\"\n \"Can you kill them if it\u0027s necessary?\"\n Ash didn\u0027t blink. \"Of course. If it\u0027s necessary. For the family honor.\"\n \"If they\u0027ve let something slip about the NightWorld-\"\n \"They\u0027re not stupid.\"\n \"They\u0027re innocent. They might get tricked. That\u0027swhat happens when you live on an island\n completely isolated from normal humans. You never learn how cunning vermin can be.\"\n \"Well, we know how cunning they can be,\" Ash said, smiling. \"And what to do about them.\"\n For the first time Quinn himself smiled, a charming, almost dreamy smile. \"Yes, I know your views on\n that. All right. I\u0027ll leave you here to take care of it. I don\u0027t need to tell you to check out every human those\n girls have had contact with. Do a good job and maybe you can save your familyhonor.\"\n \"Not to mention the embarrassment of a public trial.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come back in a week. And if you haven\u0027t got things under control, I go to the Elders. I don\u0027t\n mean your Redfern family Elders, either. I\u0027m taking it all the way up to the joint Council.\"\n \"Oh, fine,\" Ash said. \"You know, you really ought to get a hobby, Quinn. Go hunting yourself.\n You\u0027re too repressed.\"\n -252Quinn ignored that and said shortly, \"Do you know where to start?\"\n \"Sure. The girls are right ... down ... there.\" Ashturned east. With one eye shut, he zeroed in with\n his finger on a patch of light in the valley below. \"At Burdock Farm. I\u0027ll check things out in town, then I\u0027ll\n go look up the nearest vermin.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-3.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
