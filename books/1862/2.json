{"id":82067,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"You see, we\u0027re both lonely guys,\" Todd said from the back. \"\"There aren\u0027t any girls our age aroundhere,\\n\\n so we\u0027re lonely. And then when we comeacross three nice girls like you-well, we just natu rally want to\\n\\n get to know you better. Understand?\"\\n\\n \"So if you girls play along, we can all have fun,\" Vic put in.\\n\\n \"Fun-oh, no,\" Rowan said, dismayed. Jade knew she had caught part of Vic\u0027s thought and was\\n\\n tryingvery hard not to pry further. \"Kestrel and Jade are much too young for anything like that. I\u0027m sorry,\\n\\n butwe have to say no.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t do it even whenI amold enough,\" Jade said. \"But that isn\u0027t what these guys mean anyway\\n\\n they mean this.\" She projected some of the images she was getting from Vic into Rowan\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \"Oh, dear,\" Rowan said flatly. \"Jade, you know we agreed not to spy on people like that.\"\\n\\n Yeah, but look what they\u0027re thinking, Jade said soundlessly, figuring that if she had broken one rule, she\\n\\n might as well break them all.\\n\\n \"Now, look,\" Vic said in a tone that showed he knew he was losing control of the situation. He\\n\\n reached out and grabbed Jade\u0027s other arm, forcingher to face him. \"We\u0027re not here to talk. See?\" He\\n\\n gave her a little shake. Jade studied his features a moment, then turned her head to look inquiringly into\\n\\n the backseat.\\n\\n Rowan\u0027s face was creamy-pale against her brownhair. Jade could feel that she was sad and disap\\n\\n pointed. Kestrel\u0027s hair was dim gold and she was frowning.\\n\\n Well?Kestrel said silently to Rowan.\\n\\n Well?Jade said the same way. She wriggled as Victried to pull her loser. Come on, Rowan, he\u0027s\\n\\n pinching me.\\n\\n I guess we don\u0027t have any choice,Rowan said.\\n\\n Immediately Jade turned back to Vic. He was still trying to pull her, looking surprised that she didn\u0027t\\n\\n seem to be coming. Jade stopped resisting and lethim drag her in close-and then smoothly detached one\\n\\n arm from his grip and slammed her hand upward. The heel of her hand made contact just under his chin.\\n\\n His teeth clicked and his head was knocked backward, exposing his throat.\\n\\n Jade darted in and bit.\\n\\n She was feeling guilty and excited. She wasn\u0027t used to doing it like this, to taking down prey that was\\n\\n awake and struggling instead of hypnotized and docile. But she knew her instincts were as good as any\\n\\n hunter who\u0027d grown up stalking humans in alleys. It was part of her genetic programming to evaluate\\n\\n anything she saw in terms of \"Is it food? Can I get it? What are its weaknesses?\"\\n\\n The only problem was that she shouldn\u0027t been joying this feeding, because it was exactly the opposite of\\n\\n what she and Rowan and Kestrel had come to Briar Creek to do.\\n\\n She was tangentially aware of activity in the backseat. Rowan had lifted the arm Todd had been using to\\n\\n restrain her. On the other side Kestrel had done the same.\\n\\n Todd was fighting, his voice thunderstruck. \"Heyhey what are you-\"\\n\\n Rowan bit.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n Kestrel bit.\\n\\n \"What the freak are you doing? Who are you? What the freak are you?\"\\n\\n He thrashed wildly for a minute or so, and then subsided as Rowan and Kestrel mentally urged him into a trance.\\n\\n It was only another minute or so before Rowan said, \"That\u0027s enough.\"\\n\\n Jade said, Aw, Rowan ...\\n\\n \"That\u0027senough.Tell him not to remember anything about this-and find out if he knows where\\n\\n Burdock Farm is.\"\\n\\n Still feeding, Jade reached out with her mind,touching lightly with a tentacle of thought. Then she pulled\\n\\n back, her mouth closing as if in a kiss as it leftVic\u0027s skin. Vic was just a big rag doll at this point,\\n\\n and he flopped bonelessly against the steering wheeland the car door when she let him go.\\n\\n \"The farm\u0027s back that way-we have to go back tothe fork in the road,\" she said. \"It\u0027s weird,\" she\\n\\n added, puzzled. \"He was thinking that he wouldn\u0027t get in trouble for attacking us because-because of\\n\\n something about Aunt Opal. I couldn\u0027t get what.\"\\n\\n \"Probably that she was crazy,\" Kestrel said unemotionally. \"Todd was thinking that he wouldn\u0027t\\n\\n get in trouble because his dad\u0027s an Elder.\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t have Elders,\" Jade said, vaguely smug.\"You mean a governor or a police officer or\\n\\n something ?\\n\\n Rowan was frowning, not looking at them. \"All right,\" she said. \"This was an emergency; we had to do it.\\n\\n But now we\u0027re going back to what we agreed.\"\\n\\n \"Until the next emergency,\" Kestrel said, smiling out the car window into the night.\\n\\n To forestall Rowan, Jade said, \"You think we should just leave them here?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Kestrel said carelessly. \"They\u0027ll wake up in a few hours.\"\\n\\n Jade looked at Vic\u0027s neck. The two little wounds where her teeth had pierced him were already almost\\n\\n closed. By tomorrow they would be faint red marks like old bee stings.\\n\\n Five minutes later they were on the road againwith their suitcases. This time, though, Jade was cheerful.\\n\\n The difference was food-she felt as full of blood as a tick, charged with energy and ready to skip up\\n\\n mountains. She swung the cat carrier and her suitcase alternately, and Tiggy growled.\\n\\n It was wonderful being out like this, walking alonein the warm night air, with nobody to frown in\\n\\n disapproval. Wonderful to listen to the deer and rabbits and rats feeding in the meadows around her.\\n\\n Happiness bubbled up inside Jade. She\u0027d never felt so free.\\n\\n \"It is nice, isn\u0027t it?\" Rowan said softly, lookingaround as they reached the fork in the road. \"It\u0027s\\n\\n the real world. And we have as much right to it as anybody else.\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s the blood,\" Kestrel said. \"Free-range humans are so much better than the kept ones.\\n\\n Whydidn\u0027t our dear brother ever mention that?\"\\n\\n Ash, Jade thought, and felt a cold wind. She glanced behind her, not looking for a car but forsomething\\n\\n much more silent and deadly. She realized suddenly how fragile her bubble of happiness was.\\n\\n \"Are we going to get caught?\" she asked Rowan. Reverting, in the space of one second, to a\\n\\n six-yearold turning to her big sister for help.\\n\\n And Rowan, the best big sister in the world, said immediately and positively,\"No. \"\\n\\n \"But if Ash figures it out-he\u0027s the only one whomight realize-\"\\n\\n \"We are not going to get caught,\" Rowan said. \"Nobody will figure out that we\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n Jade felt better. She put down her suitcase and held out a hand to Rowan, who took it. \"Together\\n\\n forever,\" she said.\\n\\n Kestrel, who\u0027d been a few steps ahead, glanced over her shoulder. Then she came back and put her\\n\\n hand on theirs.\\n\\n \"Together forever.\"\\n\\n Rowan said it solemnly; Kestrel said it with a quicknarrowing of her yellow eyes. Jade said it with utter\\n\\n determination.\\n\\n As they walked on, Jade felt buoyant and cheerfulagain, enjoying the velvet-dark night.\\n\\n The road was just dirt here, not paved. They passed meadows and stands of Douglas fir. A farmhouse\\n\\n on the left, set back on a long driveway. And finally, dead ahead at the end of the road, another house.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" Rowan said. Jade recognized it, too, from the pictures Aunt opal had sent them. It had\\n\\n two stories, a wraparound porch, and a steeplypitched roof with lots of gables. A cupola sprouted out of\\n\\n the rooftop, and there was a weather vane on\\n\\n the barn.\\n\\n A real weather vane, Jade thought, stopping to stare. Her happiness flooded _back full force. \"I love it,\\n\\n she said solemnly.\\n\\n Rowan and Kestrel had stopped, too, but their expressions were far from awed. Rowan looked a hairs\\n\\n breadth away from horrified.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wreck,\" she gasped. \"Look at that barnthe paint\u0027s completely gone. The pictures didn\u0027t\\n\\n show that.\"\\n\\n \"And the porch,\" Kestrel said helpfully. \"It\u0027s fallingto pieces. Might go any minute.\"\\n\\n \"The work,\" Rowan whispered. \"The work it would take to fix this place up ...\"\\n\\n \"And the money,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n Jade gave them a cold look. \"Why fix it? I like it.\\n\\n It\u0027s different.\" Rigid with superiority, she picked up her luggage and walked to the end of the roadThere was a ramshackle, mostly fallen-down fence around the property, and a dangerous-looking gate.\\n\\n Beyond,on a weed-covered path, was a pile of white pickets as if somebody had been planning to fix the\\n\\n fencebut had never got around to it.\\n\\n Jade put down the suitcase and cat carrier and pulled at the gate. To her surprise, it moved easily.\\n\\n \"See, it may not look good, but it still works-\"She didn\u0027t get to finish the sentence properly. The\\n\\n gate fell on her.\\n\\n \"Well, it may not work, but it\u0027s still ours,\" she said\\n\\n as Rowan and Kestrel pulled it off her.\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s Aunt Opal\u0027s,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n Rowan just smoothed her hair back and said,\\n\\n \"Come on.\"\\n\\n There was a board missing from the porch steps, and several boards gone from the porch itself. Jade\\n\\n limped around them with dignity. The gate had given her a good whack in the shin, and since it was\\n\\n wood,it still .hurt. In fact, everything seemed to be made of wood here, which gave Jade a pleasantly\\n\\n alarmed feeling. Back home, wood was revered-,and kept outof the way.\\n\\n You have to be awfully careful to live in this kindof world, Jade thought. Or you\u0027re going to get hurt.\\n\\n Rowan and Kestrel were knocking on the door,Rowan politely, with her knuckles, Kestrel loudly, with\\n\\n the side of her hand. There wasn\u0027t any answer.\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t seem to be here,\" Rowan said.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s decided she doesn\u0027t want us,\" Kestrel said, golden eyes gleaming.\\n\\n \"Maybe she went to the wrong bus station,\"Jade said.\\n\\n \"Oh-that\u0027s it. I bet that\u0027s it,\" Rowan said. \"Poorold thing, she\u0027s waiting for us somewhere, and\\n\\n she\u0027s going to be thinking that we didn\u0027t show up.\"\\n\\n \"\"Sometimes you\u0027re not completely stupid,\" Kestrel informed Jade. High praise from Kestrel.\\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s go in,\" Jade said,to conceal howpleased she was. \"She\u0027ll come back here sometime.\"\\n\\n \"Human houses have locks,\" Rowan began, but this house wasn\u0027t locked. The doorknob\\n\\n turned in Jade\u0027s hand. The three of them stepped inside.\\n\\n It was dark, even darker than the moonless nightoutside, but Jade\u0027s eyes adjusted in a few seconds.\\n\\n \"Hey, it\u0027s not bad,\" she said. They were in ashabby but handsome living room filled with huge,\\n\\n ponderous furniture. Wood furniture, of course dark and highly polished. The tables were topped with\\n\\n marble.\\n\\n Rowan found a lightswitch, and suddenly the roomwas too bright. Blinking, Jade saw that the walls were\\n\\n pale apple green, with fancy woodwork andmoldings in a darker shade of the same green. It made Jade\\n\\n feel oddly peaceful. And anchored, somehow, as if she belonged here. Maybe it was all the heavy\\n\\n furniture.\\n\\n She looked at Rowan, who was looking around tall graceful body slowly relaxing.\\n\\n Rowan smiled and met her eyes. She noddedonce. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Jade basked for a moment in the glory of having been right twice in five minutes--and then she\\n\\n remembered her suitcase.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see what the rest of the place is like,\" she said hastily. \"I\u0027ll take the upstairs; you guys look\\n\\n around here.\"\\n\\n \"You just want the best bedroom,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n Jade ignored her, hurrying up a wide, carpeted flight of stairs. There were lots of bedrooms, and each\\n\\n one had lots of room. She didn\u0027t want the best, though, just the farthest away.\\n\\n At the very end of the hall was a room painted sea-blue. Jade slammed the door behind her and puther\\n\\n suitcase on the bed. Holding her breath, she opened the suitcase.\\n\\n Oh. Oh, no.Oh, no ...\\n\\n Three minutes later she heard the click of the doorbehind her, but didn\u0027t care enough to turn.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"Kestrel\u0027s voice said.\\n\\n Jade looked up from her frantic efforts to resuscitate the two kittens she held. \"They\u0027redead!\" she wailed.\\n\\n \"Well, what did you expect? They need to breathe, idiot. How did you expect them to make it\\n\\n through two days of traveling?\"\\n\\n Jade sniffled.\\n\\n \"Rowan told you that you could take only one.\"\\n\\n Jade sniffled harder and glared. \"I know.That\u0027s why I put these two in the suitcase.\" She hiccuped. \"At\\n\\n least Tiggy\u0027s all right.\" She dropped to her knees and peered in the cat carrier to make sure he was all\\n\\n right. His ears were laid back, his golden eyes gleaming out of a mass of black fur. He hissed, and Jade\\n\\n sat up. He was fine.\\n\\n \"For five dollars I\u0027ll take care of the dead ones,\" Kestrel said.\\n\\n \"No!\" Jade jumped up and moved protectively in front of them, fingers clawed.\\n\\n \"Not likethat,\" Kestrel said, offended. \"I don\u0027t eat carrion. Look, if you don\u0027t get rid of them\\n\\n somehow,Rowan\u0027s going to find out. For God\u0027s sake,girl, you\u0027re a vampire,\" she added as Jade cradled\\n\\n the limp bodies to her chest. \"Act like one.\"\\n\\n \"I want to bury them,\" Jade said. \"They shouldhave a funeral.\"\\n\\n Kestrel rolled her eyes and left. Jade wrapped the small corpses in her jacket and tiptoed out after her.\\n\\n A shovel, she thought. Now, where would that be?\\n\\n Keeping her ears open for Rowan, shesidledaround the first floor. All the rooms looked like the living\\n\\n room: imposing and in a state of genteel decay. The kitchen was huge. It had an open fireplace and a\\n\\n shed off the back door for washing laundry. It also had a door to the cellar.\\n\\n Jade made her way down the steps cautiously. Shecouldn\u0027t turn on a light because she needed both\\n\\n hands for the kittens. And, because of the kittens, she couldn\u0027t see her feet. She had to feel with her toe\\n\\n for the next step.\\n\\n At the bottom of the stairs her toe found something yielding, slightly resilient. It was blocking herpath.\\n\\n Slowly Jade craned her neck over the bundle of jacket and looked down.\\n\\n It was dim here. She herself was blocking the light that filtered down from the kitchen. But she could\\n\\n make out what looked like a pile of old clothes. A lumpy pile.\\n\\n Jade was getting a very, very bad feeling.\\n\\n She nudged the pile of clothes with one toe. It moved slightly. Jade took a deep breath and nudged it hard.\\n\\n It was all one piece. It rolled over. Jade looked down, breathed quickly for a moment, and screamed.\\n\\n A good, shrill, attention-getting scream. She addeda nonverbal thought, the telepathic equivalent of a siren.\\n\\n Rowan! Kestrel! You guys get down here!\\n\\n Twenty seconds later the cellar light went on andRowan and Kestrel came clattering down the stairs.\\n\\n \"I have told you and toldyou,\" Rowan was sayingthrough her teeth. \"We don\u0027tuse our-\" She\\n\\n stopped, staring.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s Aunt Opal,\" Jade said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-2.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \\n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
