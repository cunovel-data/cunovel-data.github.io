{"id":82081,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Well, she wasn\u0027t telling humans anything-but she did defy the authority of the Night World,\" Ash said in\\n\\n his most lazy, careless voice.\\n\\n Quinn said succinctly, \"How?\"\\n\\n It was late Monday afternoon and the sun was streaming through the western windows of the Burdock\\n\\n farmhouse. Ash was wearing a brand-new shirt bought at the Briar Creek general store, a turtleneckwith\\n\\n long sleeves that covered the almost-healedscars on his throat and arms. His jeans werebleached white,\\n\\n his hair was combed over the scabon the back of his head, and he was playing the scene of his life.\\n\\n \"She knew about a rogue werewolf and didn\u0027t tell.anybody about him.\"\\n\\n \"So she was a traitor. And what did you do?\"\\n\\n Ash shrugged. \"Staked her.\"\\n\\n Quinn laughed out loud.\\n\\n \"No, really,\" Ash said earnestly, looking intoQuinn\u0027s face with what he knew were wide, guileless\\n\\n eyes-probably blue. \"See?\"\\n\\n Without taking his eyes from Quinn\u0027s he whipped a pink-and-green country quilt off the bundle on the\\n\\n couch.\\n\\n Quinn\u0027s eyebrows flew upward.\\n\\n He stared for a moment at Aunt Opal, who had been cleaned so that you\u0027d never know she\u0027d ever been\\n\\n buried, and who had the picket stake carefully replaced in her chest.\\n\\n Quinn actually swallowed. It was the first time Ash had ever seen him falter.\\n\\n \"You really did it,\" he said. There was reluctant respect in his voice-and definite shock.\\n\\n You know, Quinn, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re quite as tough as you pretend. After all, no matter how you try to\\n\\n act like an Elder, you\u0027re only eighteen. And you\u0027ll always be eighteen, and next year maybe I\u0027ll be older.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Quinn said, blinking rapidly. \"Well. Well___ I have to hand it to you.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I just decided the best thing to do was cleanup the whole situation. She was getting on,\\n\\n you know.\"\\n\\n Quinn\u0027s dark eyes widened fractionally. \"I have toadmit -I didn\u0027t think you were that ruthless.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve gotta do what you\u0027ve gotta do. For the family honor, of course.\"\\n\\n Quinn cleared his throat. \"So-what about thewerewolf?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I took care of that, too.\" Ash meandered over and whipped a brown-and-white quilt off\\n\\n Exhibit B. The wolf was a charred and contorted corpse. It had given Mary-Lynnette hysterics when Ash\\n\\n insisted on pulling it out of the car, and Quinn\u0027s nostrils quivered when he looked at it.\\n\\n \"Sorry, it does smell like burnt hair, doesn\u0027t it? Igot a little sooty myself, keeping him in the fire....\"\\n\\n \"You burned himalive?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it is one of the traditional methods....\"\"Just put the blanket back, all right?\" Ash put the\\n\\n blanket back.\\n\\n \"So, you see, everything\u0027s taken care of. No humans involved, no extermination necessary.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, all right ...\" Quinn\u0027s eyes were still on the quilt. Ash decided the moment was right.\\n\\n \"And by the way, it turns out the girls had aperfectly legitimate reason for coming. They just\\n\\n wanted to learn to hunt. Nothing illegal about that,is there?\"\\n\\n \"What? Oh. No.\" Quinn glanced at Aunt Opal, then finally looked back at Ash. \"So they\u0027re\\n\\n coming back now that they\u0027ve learned it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, eventually. They haven\u0027t quite learned it yet... so they\u0027re staying.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027restaying?\"\\n\\n .................\"Right. Look, I\u0027m the head of the familyon the West Coast, aren\u0027t I? And I say they\u0027re\\n\\n staying.\"\\n\\n \"Ash............. \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s about time there was a Night World outpost in this area, don\u0027t you think? You see what\u0027s happened\\n\\n without one. You get families of outlaw werewolves wandering around. Somebody\u0027s got to stay here and\\n\\n hold down the fort.\"\\n\\n \"Ash ... you couldn\u0027t payNight People to strand themselves out here. Nothing but animals to feed\\n\\n on, nobody but humans to associate with ...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s a dirty job, but someone\u0027s got to do it.Besides, wasn\u0027t it you who said it\u0027s not good\\n\\n living your whole life isolated on an island?\"\\n\\n Quinn stared at him, then said, \"Well, I don\u0027t thinkthis is much better.\"\\n\\n \"Then it serves my sisters right. Maybe in a few years they\u0027ll appreciate the island more. Then\\n\\n theycan hand the job over to someone else.\"\\n\\n \"Ash ... no one else is going to comehere.\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" With the battle won, and Quinn simplylooking dazed and as if he wanted to get back to\\n\\n LosAngeles as fast as possible, Ash allowed himself a\\n\\n small measure of truth.\\n\\n \"I might come visit them someday,\" he said.\\n\\n \"He did a beautiful job,\" Rowan said that evening.\\n\\n \"We heard it all from the kitchen. You would have loved it.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette smiled.\\n\\n \"Quinn can\u0027t wait to get away,\" Jade said, in\\n\\n tertwining her fingers with Mark\u0027s.\\n\\n Kestrel said to Ash, \"I\u0027d just like to be around when you explain all this to Dad.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s funny,\" Ash said. \"I feel just the opposite.\" Everyone laughed-except Mary-Lynnette. The\\n\\n big farm kitchen was warm and bright, but the windowswere darkening. She couldn\u0027t see anything in the\\n\\n gathering darkness-in the last two days the effects of her blood exchange had faded. Her senses were\\n\\n ordinary human senses again.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure you won\u0027t get in trouble?\" sheasked Ash.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll tell our dad the truth-mostly. That anoutlaw werewolf killed Aunt Opal and that I killed\\n\\n the werewolf. And that the girls are better off here,hunting quietly and watching out for other rogues.\\n\\n There\u0027s sure to be some record of the Lovett fam ily.... Dad can check out the history all he wants.\"\\n\\n \"A whole family of outlaw werewolves,\" Kestrel said musingly.\\n\\n \"Ofcrazy werewolves,\" Ash said. \"They were as dangerous to the Night World as any vampire\\n\\n hunters could be. God knows how long they\u0027ve beenhere-long enough for their land to get named Mad\\n\\n Dog Creek.\"\\n\\n \"And for people to mistake them for Sasquatch,\" Mark said.\\n\\n Rowan\u0027s brown eyes were troubled. \"And it wasmy fault that you didn\u0027t know,\" she said to\\n\\n MaryLynnette. \"I told you-he couldn\u0027t be the killer. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette captured her gaze and held it. \"Rowan, you arenotgoing to feel guilty for this. You\\n\\n couldn\u0027t have realized. He wasn\u0027t killing for food like a normal werewolf. He was killing to protect his\\n\\n territory-and to scare us.\"\\n\\n \"And it might have worked,\" Mark said. \"Exceptthat you guys didn\u0027t have anywhere else to go.\"\\n\\n Ash looked at Mark, then at his sisters. \"I have a question. Is the territory around here going to be\\n\\n enough foryou?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Rowan said, with gentle surprise.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t always need tokill the animals,\" Jade said. \"We\u0027re getting it down pat now. We can\\n\\n take a little here and a little there. Heck, we can even trythe goat. \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather try Tiggy,\" Kestrel said, and for a moment her golden eyes glimmered. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t\\n\\n say it, but she wondered sometimes about Kestrel. If maybe, someday, Kestrel might need a bigger\\n\\n territory of her own. She was a lot like Jeremy in some ways.\\n\\n Beautiful, ruthless, single-minded. A true Night Person.\\n\\n \"And what about you?\" Ash said, looking at mark.\\n\\n \"Me? Uh... Well, when you get down to it, I\u0027m kind of a hamburger guy....\"\\n\\n \"I tried to take him hunting last night,\" Jade interpreted. \"You know, just to show him. But he threw up.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t actually-\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you did,\" Jade said calmly and cheerfully.\\n\\n Mark looked away. Mary-Lynnette noticed they didn\u0027t stop holding hands.\\n\\n \"So I take it you\u0027re not going to become a vampire,\" Ash said to Mark.\\n\\n \"Uh, let\u0027s just say not any time soon.\"\\n\\n Ash turned to Mary-Lynnette. \"And what about the human end of things? Do we have that taken care of?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I know everything that\u0027s going on intown-by which I mean that I talked with BunnyMarten\\n\\n this morning. I\u0027m so glad she\u0027s not a vampire, incidentally\\n\\n Mark said, \"I always knew it\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, here\u0027s the quick version.\" MaryLynnette held up a finger. \"One, everybody knowsthat Jeremy\\n\\n is gone-his boss at the gas stationmissed him yesterday and went up to check the trailer. They found a lot\\n\\n of weird stuff there. But all they know is that he\u0027s disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Rowan said.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette held up another finger. \"Two,Dad is sorry but not surprised that the stationwagon blew\\n\\n up. Claudine has been predicting itwould for a year.\"\\n\\n Another finger. \"Three, Mr. Kimble doesn\u0027t have any ideawhatkilled his horse-but now he thinks it was\\n\\n an animal instead of a person. Vic Kimble thinks it was maybe Sasquatch. He and Todd are very\\n\\n spooked and want to get out of Briar Creek forgood\\n\\n \"And let\u0027s have a moment of silence to show howwe\u0027ll miss them,\" Mark said solemnly, and blew a raspberry.\\n\\n \"Four,\" Mary-Lynnette said, holding up a fourthfinger, \"you girls are eventually going to have to\\n\\n mention that your aunt hasn\u0027t come back from her \u0027vacation.\u0027 But I thinkyou can wait awhile. Nobody\\n\\n comes out here so nobody will notice she\u0027s gone. And I think we can bury her and Jeremy safely. Even if\\n\\n somebody finds them, what have they got? A mummy that looks about a thousand years old and a wolf.\\n\\n They won\u0027t be able to connect them to the missing people.\"\\n\\n \"Poor old Aunt Opal,\" Jade said, still cheerful.\"But she helped us in the end, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette looked at her. Yes, there it is, shethought. The silver in the eyes when you laugh about\\n\\n death. Jade is a true Night Person, too.\\n\\n \"She did help. And I\u0027m going to miss her,\" she said out loud.\\n\\n Kestrel said, \"So everything is taken care of.\"\\n\\n \"Seems like it.\" Ash hesitated. \"And Quinn is waiting down the road. I_ told him it would only\\n\\n takea couple hours to finish making arrangements and say goodbye.\"\\n\\n There was a silence.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you off,\" Mary-Lynnette said at last.\\n\\n They went together to the front door. When theywere outside in the twilight Ash shut the door be hind\\n\\n them.\\n\\n \"You still can come with me, you know.\"\\n\\n \"With you and Quinn?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll send him away. Or I\u0027ll go and come back tomorrow and get you. Or I\u0027ll come back and stay....\"\\n\\n \"You need to go tell your father about this. Make everything right with him, so it\u0027s safe for your\\n\\n sisters. You knowthat.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll come back afterthat,\"Ash said, with an edge of desperation to his voice.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette looked away. The sun was gone. Looking east, the sky was already the darkest purple\\n\\n imaginable. Almost black. Even as she watched, a starcame out. Or-not a star. Jupiter.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not ready yet. I wish I were.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" Ash said, and he was right, of course. She\u0027d known ever since she sat there by\\n\\n theroad, crying while her car burned. And althoughshe\u0027d thought and thought about it since then, sitting in\\n\\n her darkened room, there was nothing she coulddo to change her own mind.\\n\\n She would never be a vampire. She just wasn\u0027t cutout for it. She couldn\u0027t do the things vampires hadto\\n\\n do-and stay sane. She wasn\u0027t like Jade or Kestrelor even Rowan with her pale sinewy feet and her\\n\\n instinctive love of the hunt. She\u0027d looked into the heart of the Night World . . .and she couldn\u0027t join it.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to be like that,\" Ash said. \"Iwant you to be likeyou. \"\\n\\n Without looking at him, Mary-Lynnette said, \"Butwe\u0027re not kids. We can\u0027t be like Jade and Mark, and\\n\\n just hold hands and giggle and never think about the future.\"\\n\\n \"No, we\u0027re only soulmates, that\u0027s all. We\u0027re onlydestined to be together forever....\"\\n\\n \"If we\u0027ve got forever, then you can give me time,\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"Go back and\u0027 wander a\\n\\n little. Take a look at the Night World and make sure youwant to give it up \"I know that already.\"\\n\\n \"Take a look at humans and make sure you wantto be tied to one of them.\"\\n\\n \"And think about the things I\u0027ve done to humans, maybe?\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette looked at him directly. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He looked away. \"All right. I admit it. I\u0027ve got a lot to make up for....\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette knew it. He\u0027d thought of humansas vermin-and food. The things she\u0027d seen in hismind\\n\\n made her not want to picture more.\\n\\n \"Then make up for what you can,\" she said, although she didn\u0027t dare really hope that he would.\\n\\n \"Take time to do that. And giveme time to finish growing up. I\u0027m still in high school, Ash.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be out in a year. I\u0027ll come back then.\"\\n\\n \"It may be too soon.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I\u0027ll come back anyway.\" He smiled ironically. \"And in the meantime I\u0027ll fight dragons,\\n\\n just like any knight for his lady. I\u0027ll prove myself. You\u0027ll be proud of me.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette\u0027s throat hurt. Ash\u0027s smile disappeared. They just stood looking at each other.\\n\\n It was the obvious time for a kiss. Instead, they just stood staring like hurt kids, and then one ofthem\\n\\n moved and they were holding on to each other. Mary-Lynnette held on tighter and tighter, her face\\n\\n buried in Ash\u0027s shoulder. Ash, who seemed to have lost it altogether, was raining kisses on the back of\\n\\n her neck, saying, \"I wish I were a human. I wishI were.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" Mary-Lynnette said, seriously unsteady because of the kisses.\\n\\n \"I do. I do.\"\\n\\n But it wouldn\u0027t help, and Mary-Lynnette knew he knew it. The problem wasn\u0027t simply what he was, it\\n\\n was what he\u0027d done-and what he was going to do. He\u0027d seen too much of the dark side of life to be a\\n\\n normal person. His nature was already formed, and she wasn\u0027t sure he could fight it.\\n\\n \"Believe in me,\" he said, as if he could hear her.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t say yes or no. So she did the only thing she could do-she lifted her head. Hislips\\n\\n were in the right place to meet hers. The electric sparks weren\u0027t painful anymore, she discovered? and the\\n\\n pink haze could be quite wonderful. For a time everything was warm and sweet and strangelypeaceful.\\n\\n And then, behind them, somebody knocked on thedoor. Mary-Lynnette and Ash jumped and\\n\\n separated.They looked at each other, startled, emotions still tooraw, and then Mary-Lynnette realized\\n\\n where she was. She laughed and so did Ash.\\n\\n \"Come out,\" they said simultaneously.\\n\\n Mark and Jade came out. Rowan and Kestrel werebehind them. They all stood on the porch-avoiding\\n\\n the hole. They all smiled at Ash and Mary-Lynnette in a way that made Mary-Lynnette blush.\\n\\n \"Goodbye,\" she said firmly to Ash.\\n\\n He looked at her for a long moment, then looked at the road behind him. Then he turned to go.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette watched him, blinking away tears.She still couldn\u0027t let herself believe in him. But there\\n\\n was no harm in hoping, was there? In wishing. Evenif wishes almost never came true....\\n\\n Jade gasped. \"Look!\"\\n\\n They all saw it, and Mary-Lynnette felt her heartjump violently. A bolt of light was streaking acrossthe\\n\\n darkness in the northeast. Not a little wimpyshooting star-a brilliant green meteor that crossedhalf the\\n\\n sky, showering sparks. It was right above Ash\u0027s path, as if lighting his way.\\n\\n A late Perseid. The last of the summer meteors. But it seemed like a blessing.\\n\\n \"Quick, quick, wish,\" Mark was telling Jade eagerly. \"A wish on that star you gotta get.\"\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette glanced at his excited face, at theway his eyes shone with excitement. Beside him, Jade\\n\\n was clapping, her own eyes wide with delight.\\n\\n I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re happy, Mary-Lynnette thought. My wish for you came true. So now maybe I can wish for myself.\\n\\n I wish ... I wish ...\\n\\n Ash turned around and smiled at her. \"See you next year,\" he said. \"With slain dragons!\"\\n\\n He started down the weed-strewn path to the road. For a moment, in the deep violet twilight, he didlook\\n\\n to Mary-Lynnette like a knight walking off ona quest. A knight-errant with shining blond hair and no\\n\\n weapons, going off into a very dark and dangerous wilderness. Then he turned around and walked\\n\\n backward, waving, which ruined the effect.\\n\\n Everyone shouted goodbyes.\\n\\n Mary-Lynnette could feel them around her, her brother and her three blood-sisters, all radiating warmth\\n\\n and support. Playful Jade. Fierce Kestrel. Wise and gentle Rowan. And Mark, who wasn\u0027t sullen and\\n\\n solitary anymore. Tiggy wound himselfaround her ankles, purring amiably.\\n\\n \"Even when we\u0027re apart, we\u0027ll be looking at the same sky!\" Ash yelled.\\n\\n \"What a line,\" Mary-Lynnette called back. But hewas right. The sky would be there for both of\\n\\n them.She\u0027d alwaysknow hewas out there somewhere,looking up at it in wonder. Just knowing that was\\n\\n important. And she was clear on who she was at last. Shewas Mary-Lynnette, and someday she\u0027d discover a\\n\\n supernova or a comet or a black hole, but she\u0027d doit as a human. And Ash would come back next year.\\n\\n And she would always love the night.\\n\\n [The End] \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-17.html","bookId":1862,"book":{"id":1862,"title":"Night World : Daughters of Darkness (Night World #2)","description":"Storyline: Daughters of Darkness (Night World Book 2) \\n Mary-Lynnette, 17, loves to watch the stars from her Oregon backyard.
