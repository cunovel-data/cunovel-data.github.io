Drust stopped hitting me but that\u0027s all that changed. I can\u0027t get the hang of this new magic. It\u0027s too different. I wish Drust would focus on natural magic and help me improve that way. I learnt a lot from Banba but my powers have grown rusty. I think we should work on the type of magic I grew up with.\\n\\n But Drust is firm. He says he can\u0027t teach me the way a priestess could, since he doesn\u0027t work that way. And even if he could, he wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re no good to me the way you were!\" he snaps when I question the need to learn new spells. \"I need more!\"\\n\\n But what for? Why does he need me? What\u0027s he grooming me to do?\\n\\n Sleeping deeply. Dreaming of happier days-Banba alive, no demons, safe. Enjoying the dream, but midway through an inner voice whispers, \"Wake up.\" Connla\u0027s been guarding us for the last few hours. Now it\u0027s my turn to go on watch.\\n\\n I\u0027m excellent at waking myself. I never need to be called. It was one of the first spells Banba taught me. A priestess has to be able to control her dreams. Otherwise she can cause chaos while asleep.\\n\\n I\u0027m lying on my back, next to Orna, cloak drawn across my body and over my head. I turn slightly, careful not to break Drust\u0027s masking spell. I look across to where Connla is. And see a demon.\\n\\n For a second I think I\u0027m still dreaming, because the demon doesn\u0027t appear to be attacking Connla. It\u0027s crouched beside him, bent over, head close to his, as though talking. And when I prick my ears I can hear it whispering.\\n\\n A drop of rain hits me square between the eyes. I blink-then snap out of my stupor. Leaping to my feet, I roar at the top of my voice, \"Demons!\"\\n\\n Everyone comes alive in an instant, on their feet, weapons in hands. Ronan notches an arrow to his bow, takes aim and... stops as the demon turns to look at him. I see Ronan\u0027s fingers quiver, his face twitch, his eyes narrow. He wants to unleash the arrow but he can\u0027t. The demon\u0027s controlling him.\\n\\n Lorcan attacks, sword and axe a blur, screaming a challenge. The demon points with a lumpy, pale red hand. And Lorcan stops too, not frozen in place exactly, but hovering beyond striking distance of the demon, unable to advance.\\n\\n Goll and Orna are about to leap forward when Drust shouts, \"No! Leave him!\"\\n\\n The druid is sitting up. His hands are joined. His lips are moving quickly, gaze fixed on the demon. He looks more purposeful than frightened.\\n\\n Nobody moves. All eyes are pinned on the demon and the druid. Now that my sight has adjusted and there\u0027s time to observe, I get a clear view of the monster. It\u0027s tall, with eight arms, roughly shaped hands, dangling strips of flesh instead of legs and feet. Hovering in the air, not touching the ground. Pale red skin, flecked with blood. At first I think it\u0027s Connla\u0027s blood-I\u0027m sure he\u0027s dead- but then I notice scores of cracks in the demon\u0027s skin, from which blood oozes, giving the lumpy flesh its unhealthy crimson tinge. No hair. Its eyes are dark red, with a black circle at the centre of each globe. No nose, just two gaping cavities in the middle of its face. No heart either-just a hole in its chest filled with eel-like creatures, which slither over and under one another, hissing and spitting.\\n\\n The demon cocks its head and smiles sadly at Drust. \"You are powerful, druid. The girl too, if she could only learn what you teach her.\"\\n\\n Complete shock. I\u0027ve never heard a demon speak like this, in words of our own. It-he-has a deep, sorrowful voice. Not entirely human, but the words are clearly formed. A demon who can speak as a human must also be able to think as a human. Drust\u0027s prediction-and our worst fear-has been confirmed.\\n\\n Then the meaning of his words sink home. He knows Drust has been trying to teach me. He knows I\u0027ve been failing. That means he can either read minds or...\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been following us!\" I shriek, taking a step towards the heartless creature.\\n\\n \"Bec!\" Drust hisses. \"Don\u0027t get involved!\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"Such sadness,\" the demon murmurs. \"So much pain. A quest doomed to fail. This land overrun by demons. Everybody killed. And all your fault, Little One. Your people will die because you failed them. Imagine the humiliation and guilt.\"\\n\\n I tremble, not wanting to believe him. But he sounds so sure of himself, so certain this is what the future holds. There\u0027s pity in his voice. I get the feeling he wants to comfort me. As I\u0027m thinking this, the demon extends two arms and nods encouragingly. \"Come to me,\" he whispers. \"Seek solace in the embrace of loving Lord Loss.\"\\n\\n I move closer to him, gripped by his power and the promise of comfort. The demon-Lord Loss-smiles and nods again. This isn\u0027t right. He\u0027s making me do his bidding and nothing good can come of that. But I can\u0027t resist. I\u0027m filled with a sense of grief and only Lord Loss seems able to help.\\n\\n Then Drust is by my side, talking quickly. \"Use magic. This demon is of the Otherworld, of the stars. He generates power. Take it. Use it. Fight.\"\\n\\n My body continues forward as though Drust hadn\u0027t spoken. But my mind\u0027s in a whirl. I\u0027ll die if I come within the demon\u0027s reach. He\u0027ll suck all the life from me and toss me aside, or keep me on as a member of the undead. I try using old magic spells to fight him but I can\u0027t move my lips to utter the words.\\n\\n Drust\u0027s warning echoes. The demon is of the stars. He generates power. I recall my recent lessons, the spells Drust tried to teach me, how he encouraged me to draw from the stars, to channel magic from a celestial source.\\n\\n With my mind, heart and spirit I reach out to Lord Loss. I feel his power, his magic. And I draw from it. I rip it from him sharply, fiercely, filling with it, hair shooting up straight, eyes widening, arms flying out wide.\\n\\n The demon gasps and rises a few feet higher off the ground. I float too, supported by magic, drawing my power from the sky instead of the earth, becoming part of the world of the air.\\n\\n I turn my hands palms down. Two large stones rise from the ground, ripping free, dripping soil and pebbles, floating upwards. They stop short of my hands, which I slide behind the stones. I look from hand to hand, stone to stone. Then at Lord Loss. I smile-and push. The stones zip towards him.\\n\\n The demon\u0027s arms shoot out and the stones explode into clouds of dust and tiny brittle shards. Everybody ducks to avoid being pierced. Except me and Lord Loss. We remain motionless, supported by the air and magic, staring at each other.\\n\\n Some of the stone splinters strike the demon\u0027s cheeks and open fresh, deep cuts. He doesn\u0027t look angry or surprised. Just sad.\\n\\n \"Such potential,\" the demon sighs. \"What a waste. To die so young, when you could achieve so much...\"\\n\\n \"Begone!\" Drust roars, getting to his feet, linking his right hand with my left. I fill with even more power than before. I feel like I could reach up and quench the stars themselves. \"Go or fight!\" Drust shouts.\\n\\n \"Fight?\" the demon chuckles. \"I could destroy you both without even nearing my limits.\" One hand starts to point at us. Then stops. The demon lowers his arms. \"But where would be the sport in that?\" he murmurs. And then he turns smoothly and drifts away into the darkness of the night.\\n\\n Just when I think he\u0027s gone, there comes a call from the shadows. \"You stole from me, Bec. You took magic which was not yours. Pain will come of that. And great sorrow. And death.\" A teasing pause, then he adds, \"It starts tomorrow.\"\\n\\n Then he really is gone, leaving behind silence, confusion... and terror.\\n\\n Connla\u0027s alive. He rises when the demon leaves. Pale and shivering. He says he was asleep until my shout, that he couldn\u0027t move when he woke, held in place by magic. Drust checks to see if the demon has fed from him but can find no marks on the warrior\u0027s flesh.\\n\\n I\u0027m not interested in Connla or why Lord Loss was whispering to him in his sleep instead of killing him. I have time only for magic. I\u0027ve never felt this powerful or so alive. The world looks and feels completely different. I can see as if it\u0027s day. The stars are brighter than a full moon, shining through the cover of the clouds, pulsing, multicoloured. And they\u0027re connected! I couldn\u0027t see it until tonight but now it\u0027s obvious. The sky\u0027s like a giant system of roots, each star linked. The lines between the stars are veins of magical power. The sky is alive. I can draw magic from it, just as Banba taught me to draw from a tree or a stag.\\n\\n I reach out with my mind and suck in power. I want it all, the whole of the sky, every bit of magic it has to offer. I can be a goddess, capable of changing the world with a click of my fingers. I can...\\n\\n \"No,\" Drust says softly. I look down and see that his hands are on either side of my shoulders but not touching me. His eyes are as dark as the sky is bright. \"You must stop.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I whisper, continuing to draw strength from the stars.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t be able to contain so much power. Your body will unravel. You\u0027ll die.\"\\n\\n \"I can hold it together,\" I sigh. \"With this much magic I can do anything.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he says firmly. \"It will destroy you.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t want to believe him. I don\u0027t want to stop. But I can see the truth in his expression. He\u0027s not a jealous teacher intent on holding me back-he\u0027s a worried ally trying to save me. Reluctantly I pull back and cut off the seductive flow of power from the stars. The world dims around me. I become human again.\\n\\n Drust\u0027s hands close on my shoulders and he squeezes warmly. \"You did well,\" he says.\\n\\n \"I did it,\" I reply, hardly able to believe it now the moment has passed. \"I made the magic work. Your magic.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He doesn\u0027t let go. He looks troubled. \"I\u0027ve never seen someone make the leap from novice to adept so swiftly. The demon said you stole magic from him. The power that involved...\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to steal,\" I say quietly. \"Is it a bad thing?\"\\n\\n Drust shakes his head and smiles thinly. \"No. Just unexpected.\" He releases me. \"Now, let\u0027s get everybody settled down and restore the masking spells. There may be other demons nearby who might not be so willing to retreat as Lord Loss.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know what he was?\" I ask. \"Why he could speak? What he meant about death and sorrow coming tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"We will talk about him shortly,\" Drust says. \"First the spells. You can help me cast them this time. Listen carefully, then copy what I do.\" And he shows me. And I try it. And it works. Easy.\\n\\n \"Lord Loss is one of the more powerful Demonata,\" Drust says. We\u0027re all lying close together. It\u0027s late in the night but nobody can sleep, not after what we\u0027ve so recently witnessed. \"He\u0027s a demon master.\"\\n\\n \"You said they couldn\u0027t come through yet,\" Fiachna notes.\\n\\n Drust nods thoughtfully. \"When the first demon master forces its way through the tunnel, it will widen. There will be a flood of demons more powerful than those who roam the land now, eager to get in on the killing while there are humans left to kill. They\u0027ll be savage, unformed, monstrous. We\u0027ll know when they are here-the screams of the dying will fill the air.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Lord Loss came through the tunnel, or that he crossed any time recently. He could speak our language. Even the powerful demon masters cannot do that without much practice. I believe he has been here for many years, walking among us.\"\\n\\n \"How?\" Orna gasps. \"The demons only started coming last year.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Drust says. \"Some came before that. There are ways for humans to summon them. They can never stay for long. They usually kill recklessly, then slip back to their own foul realm. But this one seems at home here...\" He falls silent, then says, \"Much of our knowledge of the Demonata comes from the Old Creatures. They walked the land once. This was their world. They instructed the early druids, told them about demons, taught them how to fight. But they did not teach us all that they knew. Perhaps they couldn\u0027t, since they were gods and we were only humans.\\n\\n \"As far as I was aware, demons could not roam this world freely unless a tunnel was open. That is what the Old Creatures taught us, and we have seen evidence of that in the many centuries since they withdrew from our company. But I see now that there are exceptions to that rule. Lord Loss must be one of them.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure he was a demon?\" Goll asks. \"He looked more like a Fomorii to me, judging by the old legends.\"\\n\\n \"He was definitely a Demonata,\" Drust says. \"But he is different to most. The majority revel in bloodshed. The masters are like the weaker demons which you\u0027ve seen-crude and wild, interested only in slaughter. Lord Loss appears to be more cultured. Cruel rather than brute. He could have killed us but he didn\u0027t. Instead he spoke of sport and future suffering. He-\"\\n\\n \"The stones!\" I blurt out. I\u0027d been thinking about him trailing us by day, moving among us at night, when an image clicked into place. \"I saw him at the ring!\" When the others look blank, I tell them about the demon I saw when we were trapped within the circle of magical stones. \"There was one who didn\u0027t pay attention to Bran when he was running around and dancing. He was by himself, floating in the air, watching the rest of us. It was Lord Loss. He\u0027s been following us since then.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\" Orna asks.\\n\\n \"Sport,\" Drust replies, face dark with worry. \"I think this demon is as vicious as any of the others, but he feasts on the agony of humans instead of their blood. Sorrow excites him. He must have sensed the promise of pain when he saw you and has been following ever since, waiting for the misery to start.\"\\n\\n \"Then it will be a long wait!\" Goll huffs. \"I won\u0027t be played by a demon. Now that we know he\u0027s here, we can fight him.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Drust says gloomily but his eyes are dark and I can see the embers of fear in them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-10.html","bookId":2178,"book":{"id":2178,"title":"Bec (The Demonata #4)","description":"Storyline: Bec (The Demonata #4) \\n The fourth novel in this bonechilling series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. \\n As demonic Fomorii ravage their land, Bec and a band of warrior companions leave their devastated rath to answer a plea for help.
