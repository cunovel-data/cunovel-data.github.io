{"id":99545,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"A quiet night. No attacks. The demons think everyone here is dead, so they\u0027ve no reason to bother with the crannog. I get a night of deep sleep and so do the others, too exhausted even for nightmares. We all wake refreshed in the morning. Drust\u0027s already up. He\u0027s prepared cold slices of meat from the night before and hot porridge, which we share in silence in the greyish pre-dawn haze.\\n\\n Fiachna searches the village for a forge, smith\u0027s tools or other weapons like Bran\u0027s knife but he doesn\u0027t find any. The rest of us go on a quick search too, for weapons or food. We kill the remaining chickens, take the eggs they\u0027ve laid and some slabs of cured pork. But there\u0027s little else worthwhile.\\n\\n We\u0027re ready to go but Drust says he needs to pray first. He finds a place where he can face the rising sun, then kneels, closes his eyes and meditates.\\n\\n \"How long will he be?\" Connla asks me.\\n\\n \"Five or ten minutes.\" Actually, I don\u0027t have a clue but I don\u0027t want to look ignorant in front of Connla.\\n\\n \"Time enough for a quick shave,\" Connla says. Filling a bucket with water, he douses his face, takes a small knife, wets the blade and waits for the water to settle. Then, studying his reflection, he scrapes the hairs off his cheeks and chin. Most of the men in our rath grow beards but Connla prefers the smooth look. Goll sometimes teases him about it, says he looks like a girl.\\n\\n Bran-it\u0027s hard not to think of him as Run Fast-watches Connla shave, fascinated. Maybe he\u0027s never seen a man shaving before. He pays extra close attention as Connla trims around the sides of his upper lip, careful not to disturb the hairs of his moustache. As he\u0027s finishing, cleaning the blade, Bran reaches over, grabs a patch of Connla\u0027s moustache and yanks hard. The hairs rip out and Connla howls with pain and surprise.\\n\\n Bran holds the hairs up proudly, grinning. He thought Connla missed them and was trying to help. But Connla doesn\u0027t see it that way. He roars at the boy and swings a fist. Bran ducks, still holding up the hairs. Connla lunges after him. Bran laughs and flees, shouting, \"Run fast! Run fast!\" Connla chases, cursing foully, drawing his sword.\\n\\n The rest of us fall about with laughter. We know Connla won\u0027t catch Bran-if he was too fast for demons, a human stands no chance. Connla eventually realises this and stops chasing the boy. After hurling a few final curses at him and some more at us, he storms back to the bucket, regards his ruined moustache with a miserable expression, then scrapes the rest of the hairs away, shaving his lip bare.\\n\\n Bran edges up to me, timidly holding out the hairs. \"Giblets,\" he says, handing them over. I give the boy a delighted hug. Goll claps him hard on the back-the old warrior is crying with laughter.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d keep him out of Connla\u0027s way for a few hours,\" Fiachna chuckles. \"He\u0027ll calm down later but he\u0027ll be in a foul mood for a while.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I grin, squeezing Bran tight. \"I\u0027ll look after him.\"\\n\\n \"Giblets,\" Bran repeats, stroking the hairs fondly, as if they were petals, making us all laugh again.\\n\\n Shortly after the sun rises, Drust stops praying and we depart. Bran trots along beside us, unaware of the scowling Connla\u0027s dark looks. I keep the boy close, in case the surly warrior tries to hurt him. I doubt he would, but I\u0027m never sure about Connla. He\u0027s a hard one to read. Impossible to know how he\u0027ll react to a joke or how deeply to heart he\u0027ll take a light insult.\\n\\n I study Bran as he jogs, smiling at the countryside, squinting up at the sky and birds, perfectly content. I assume he had family and friends in the crannog, all of whom are dead now, but he doesn\u0027t seem bothered by the loss. At first I pity him but the more I think about it, pity turns to envy. It must be nice to live like Bran, immune to the pains which the rest of us suffer. Knowing what I know-that unless Drust succeeds, this land will be overrun by unstoppable demons-I wish I could be as empty-headed as the fleet-footed boy.\\n\\n Heading due west, we make good time. After a while Drust drops back and walks beside me, nudging Bran out of the way. The druid asks lots of questions about my past, Banba, my training. He wants to know what I can do, how powerful I am. He sneers when I tell him about my remarkable memory-that doesn\u0027t interest him. When he asks about my family, I tell him I\u0027m an orphan of unknown origin.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no idea who your people were?\" he presses.\\n\\n \"No.\" I pause. \"Do you?\"\\n\\n He frowns. \"Why should I?\"\\n\\n I shrug, not wishing to tell him about my vision and the possibility that my mother might have been sending me out to find my original clan.\\n\\n Drust continues asking about my magic, what spells I know, where my strengths lie. His enquiries fill me with unease. They shouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s natural for a magician to be interested in the abilities of another. But this doesn\u0027t feel like simple curiosity. He seems to be testing me, probing for weaknesses. I recall what he said back in the hut-\"You\u0027ll do\"-and worry burns in my stomach like a fire.\\n\\n At midday we take a short rest. Drust sits slightly apart from the rest of us. Instead of eating, he pulls a board out of the bag which he carries on his back. A strange board, the surface divided into an equal number of black and white squares. It\u0027s the thickness of the length of my thumb, made of crystal. He sets it down on the ground, then spills small, carved shapes out on to the grass. When he starts to position the pieces on the board, I realise it\u0027s some sort of game.\\n\\n \"Chess,\" Orna says as Drust moves the first piece.\\n\\n Drust looks up eagerly. \"You play?\"\\n\\n \"No. One of the slaves in our tuath had a set but it was only played by men. I picked up some of the rules by watching but I don\u0027t know them all.\"\\n\\n \"A pity,\" Drust sighs. \"It\u0027s been a long time since I had anyone to test my wits against.\"\\n\\n He concentrates. Moves a white piece shaped like a horse\u0027s head, then one of the many simply shaped black pieces. Everyone\u0027s interested in this new game. We\u0027ve never seen it in our tuath. Orna explains about the game while Drust plays but it\u0027s hard to follow the rules, especially as Orna is unsure of them herself.\\n\\n \"The main aim is to keep your king from being taken?\" Lorcan asks.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Orna says.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t he fight?\" Ronan frowns. \"A king should be a fine warrior, yet the kings in this game seem scared. They hide at the back.\"\\n\\n \"It hails from a different land,\" Orna explains. \"In some places kings don\u0027t fight. They send others to battle in their place.\"\\n\\n Angry mutters from the men-\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not right!\"\\n\\n \"Barbarians!\"\\n\\n \"The likes of those wouldn\u0027t last long against demons!\"\\n\\n I ignore them and focus on Drust and the way his hands linger over the pieces. Long, slender, unmarked fingers. They move the pieces swiftly, smoothly, from one spot to the other. I get the sense that he could move us just as easily. And maybe already has.\\n\\n After lunch, Drust marches beside me again. But now, instead of asking questions, he says, \"I can teach you if you\u0027re willing to learn.\"\\n\\n \"Chess?\" I reply eagerly.\\n\\n \"No. Magic.\"\\n\\n I come to a halt and stare at him as if he\u0027d slapped me. Fiachna and Connla stop behind us, hands sliding to their weapons. I start walking again before they ask what\u0027s wrong. Drust keeps pace beside me, waiting for me to speak. Bran\u0027s on the other side, following a butterfly. My head\u0027s buzzing with conflicting thoughts. I\u0027d love to learn magic from a druid-they can do so much more than priestesses. But men teach boys. Women teach girls. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s always been.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t teach you all the spells I\u0027d teach a male student,\" Drust says, reading my thoughts. \"There are secrets not fitting for one of your gender, just as you know secrets not suitable for a man. But we could work on your technique. I could show you where you\u0027re weak, help you improve and teach you some new spells, those which you deem acceptable.\"\\n\\n \"But men... girls... it isn\u0027t done,\" I mutter, red-faced at the thought of sharing my spirit with a man, as I must if I allow him to become my tutor.\\n\\n \"Just because something hasn\u0027t been done doesn\u0027t mean it shouldn\u0027t be,\" Drust says. \"I\u0027d prefer a boy to work with, just as you\u0027d rather learn from a priestess. The fact is we have only each other. We can be bold and make the most of this opportunity or we can be prim and let it pass. Bec?\"\\n\\n He waits for my answer. After a long, dry-mouthed moment, I nod clumsily. \"I would be... glad to learn... from you.\\n\\n \"Good,\" he says, then rests his left fingers against my forehead. \"Close your eyes and think of the moon. Before we begin, I want to teach you how to clear your head of all the rubbish you\u0027ve let it fill with lately. Your mind is too much that of a human, not a priestess.\"\\n\\n A rush. A buzz. Tingling all over. My head... my body... my spirit... full of... magic.\\n\\n Four days marching. Four nights spent in the open. We lie down each dusk, singly or in pairs, sheltering beneath trees. Drust comes to each of us in turn, touches us and mutters spells. We have orders not to move during the night, even if we need to empty our insides.\\n\\n \"Go where you lie if you have to,\" Drust says. \"Just don\u0027t leave the spot where you settle. The spell will break if you do.\"\\n\\n The first night-nothing. No undead or demons. I sleep fitfully, tucked up next to Goll, aware of Drust\u0027s magic-the air flickering around me-wondering if it will hold.\\n\\n The second night, a beast pieced together from several humans stumbles by. It\u0027s moaning and scratching at the earth with bone-exposed fingers. Starving, hungry for any kind of flesh, even that of insects. It passes within four or five strides of where I\u0027m resting with Orna. We hold our breath. I feel Orna\u0027s fingers slide slowly to her sword. I want to whisper, \"No!\" but I\u0027m afraid to make any noise.\\n\\n The undead creature stops. I think it\u0027s seen us. Orna hisses. Her hand finds the hilt of her sword. Her fingers tighten.\\n\\n Then a fox darts out from under a bush and pelts away from the undead beast. It howls and lumbers after the animal, arms flapping up and down.\\n\\n Silence, broken after a few seconds by Drust. \"The only two who didn\u0027t reach for their weapons were Bec and Goll. And Goll\u0027s asleep.\" A short pause. I sense his smile in the dark. \"Now that you\u0027ve seen my magic at work, I hope you act less rashly next time. You nearly gave our hiding place away.\"\\n\\n We sleep better after that, though at least one of us remains awake at any given time, watching out not just for the undead and the Demonata-but also keeping an eye on the mysterious Drust.\\n\\n Under Drust\u0027s stern eye, I begin practising magic and learn quickly, feeling my power grow. But I\u0027m unable to make the new spells work. Men\u0027s magic is different to women\u0027s. We take power from the earth, trees, the wind, sun, moon. The world is charged with natural magic which we channel. We\u0027re creatures of nature, and like bees take pollen from flowers, we pluck grains of magic from the land and air around us.\\n\\n Drust\u0027s magic is different. He only reveals fragments of his secrets to me, but he seems to draw most of his power from the stars. Some of it from the sun and moon, but mostly from the heavens beyond.\\n\\n \"Gods are in motion up there,\" he says to me on the fourth night. Drust sleeps by himself, but tonight he asked me to sleep close by. There aren\u0027t many clouds in the sky, so we have a good view of the stars. \"Demons too. And the spirits of the dead. They battle, toil, love-like us. But their actions are greater than ours. They inhabit forms hundreds or thousands of times our size.\"\\n\\n His eyes are fixed on the stars. From their light I can see the tattooed stars on his head moving slowly. His expression is soft for once.\\n\\n \"When they come here, they come in forms similar to ours,\" he continues. \"This world is too small for them otherwise. But up there...\" He sighs. \"Male magic comes from the forces generated by the gods, the dead and the Demonata. We\u0027ve learnt to tap into their power, the way priestesses tap into the roots of trees or the hearts of bears. But the magnitude... the dangers...\"\\n\\n He turns on his side-only slightly, so as not to break the masking spell-and trains his gaze on me. \"Man wasn\u0027t made to share the universe with gods. Their ways are not meant for the humble likes of us. But we\u0027ve decoded some of their secrets regardless. Like worms, we\u0027ve grabbed on to the talons of eagles and learnt some small truths and means of flight. But we can never really fly. We try, and succeed to a certain extent, but the fall is always-will always be-there. To be a druid is to embrace death, dance with it a while and finally fall prey to it. That is why we\u0027ll never rule this world. We have the power to bend all men to our whim, but are forever pushing ourselves further, trying to fly higher... and falling.\"\\n\\n A silence. His gaze returns to the sky. He looks troubled.\\n\\n \"We could have crushed the Christians hundreds of years ago. They were weak then. If we\u0027d been aware of the threat they posed, we\u0027d have bound their tongues and turned their fingers to stone so they couldn\u0027t speak or write. Their religion would have died with them. But our eyes were on the Otherworld, the stars, the gods. We didn\u0027t keep watch on the world around us. And when we eventually lowered our heads and studied the waters closer to home, it was too late.\"\\n\\n \"You could still stop the Christians,\" I mutter quietly, hoping he won\u0027t punish me for disagreeing with him. Drust\u0027s a harsh teacher. When I make mistakes, he slaps the back of my head or stamps on my foot or lashes me with a knotted rope. Banba was tough too, but not as cruel as Drust.\\n\\n \"Could we?\" Drust sighs. \"Some believe it\u0027s not too late-even as they retreat from the world of man and hide in caves or deep in forests. I don\u0027t agree. Our time has passed. We\u0027ll survive in some form or other, I\u0027m sure. But we\u0027ll never be this strong or fly so high again.\"\\n\\n He says nothing after that, and I know better than to disturb him. Lying on my back, watching the stars until my lids grow heavy and close, I think about his words and try to imagine a world where druids and magic have no place. And I realise, just before I fall asleep, that in such a world I would have no place either.\\n\\n Marching. Eyes half closed. Feeling power around me-power from the stars and those who drift among them. Trying to absorb it. Muttering the words of a spell which Drust taught me. I\u0027m holding a small rock. If the spell works, the rock will float for a second or two.\\n\\n I stutter on a key word and lose my place. Drust\u0027s hand instantly connects with the back of my head. \"Concentrate!\" he snaps.\\n\\n \"I am!\" I snap back. It\u0027s the seventh or eighth time he\u0027s hit me in the last hour. I\u0027m sick of it. \"I can\u0027t do this stupid men\u0027s magic! Teach Bran, why don\u0027t you!\"\\n\\n Bran\u0027s head rises. He\u0027s been walking along just behind us, humming a tune.\\n\\n \"He couldn\u0027t do any worse than you,\" Drust snarls, slapping me again, harder this time. That\u0027s it! My right hand comes up. I\u0027m going to slap him back-see what he thinks! But before I can...\\n\\n \"People often say I\u0027m too small to be a smith.\"\\n\\n Drust and I look up, startled. Fiachna, who was marching ahead of us, has stopped and is smiling.\\n\\n \"This has nothing to do with you,\" Drust growls.\\n\\n \"I never said it had,\" Fiachna replies. \"I\u0027m just remarking-people often say I\u0027m too small to be a smith. They think smiths have to be large, burly men who can swing two heavy hammers at once and bend iron with their hands. And most are. But they don\u0027t need to be.\\n\\n \"My master was a gentle man. He had a bad leg. He broke it when he was a child and it didn\u0027t heal properly. So he never fought. But he made some of the finest weapons imaginable. He knew iron, how to bend it to his will and get the best out of it. He\u0027d always talk while he worked, happily chatting away, seemingly to himself. People thought he was mad but he wasn\u0027t. He was talking to the iron, learning from it, easing and teasing it into the shape he wanted-the shape it wanted.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see-\" Drust begins but Fiachna talks over him.\\n\\n \"He taught me to work that way too. He never beat me or shouted or lost his temper. I wasn\u0027t his first apprentice or his last. He\u0027d take boys on for a while, teach them his ways, observe them, then let them go if he felt they couldn\u0027t learn from him.\" A short pause, then he adds, \"Apologies for telling you your business but that might be the best way to teach Bec. Unless you think she can\u0027t learn.\"\\n\\n \"She can!\" Drust shouts. \"She has potential. I can feel it.\"\\n\\n \"Then hitting her won\u0027t help, will it?\" Fiachna says calmly. \"My master always said you couldn\u0027t beat a skill out of somebody. They had to learn in their own way and time. If you rushed them, you only delayed them. You had to be firm but not cruel. Cruelty is a barrier and barriers slow people down.\"\\n\\n \"My masters beat me unconscious whenever I made a mistake,\" Drust says and he sounds like a bitter child.\\n\\n \"Did you learn anything while you were knocked out?\" Fiachna asks.\\n\\n Drust starts to roar a retort, then stops and frowns.\\n\\n \"Hard to learn when you\u0027re dead to the world,\" Fiachna says, nodding slowly. Then he turns and starts walking again.\\n\\n Drust looks at me and catches my smile. He scowls. \"I don\u0027t like being spoken down to by a smith,\" he huffs and my smile fades. Then his expression mellows. \"But only a fool ignores good advice simply because it comes from an unlikely source. Very well, Bec MacConn. We\u0027ve tried it my way. Now we\u0027ll try it Fiachna\u0027s. No more beatings for a few days. If you improve, well and good. If not...\" He grins tightly. \"I\u0027ll have to whip you all the harder!\"\\n\\n I gulp, torn between the relief of the present and the threat of the future. Then I take a breath, relax and start again, drawing in power from the sky, chanting the words of the spell, focusing on the stone, willing it to rise. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-9.html","bookId":2178,"book":{"id":2178,"title":"Bec (The Demonata #4)","description":"Storyline: Bec (The Demonata #4) \\n The fourth novel in this bonechilling series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. \\n As demonic Fomorii ravage their land, Bec and a band of warrior companions leave their devastated rath to answer a plea for help.
