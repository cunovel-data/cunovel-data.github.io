{"id":99553,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The Old Creatures fall silent and I get the sense that they won\u0027t talk to us again. Drust senses it too and prepares to leave in a hurry without asking any further questions. Once we\u0027ve recast the breathing and warming spells, he takes my hand-without looking me in the eye-and we jump into the pool, sink, then return through the tunnel. I thought we\u0027d move slower this time, because the force of the water is against us, but it\u0027s exactly the same as before.\\n\\n Shooting out of the tunnel, we rise to the surface, where we hang, bobbing up and down with the swell of the waves. I don\u0027t break my breathing spell-the water is still foaming over my head. With his free hand, Drust points at the cliff face. I think he\u0027s mad-there\u0027s no way we can make the cliff safely or climb it even if we could-but I don\u0027t argue as he guides us towards it, opposing the pull and cut of the waves.\\n\\n We move on the surface of the sea as we moved below, propelled by magic, not swimming, but gliding like seabirds across the surf. The wind and waves lash us angrily, as though enraged by our ability to defy them.\\n\\n Closer to the lethal screen of the cliff... closer... almost upon it. One more sweep of a wave and I\u0027ll be able to reach out and touch it.\\n\\n We come to a stop and hang calmly in the water, rising and falling with the swell of the waves, but not moving towards or away from the cliff. Drust puts his free hand on mine and moves it forward until I make contact with the rock. He then nudges my other hand up beside it and releases both at the same time. As soon as he lets go, the wind and waves bite at me, trying to rip me loose. I cling to the cliff by my fingertips and scream, shattering the breathing spell.\\n\\n Then Drust\u0027s arm is around me and he\u0027s shouting in my ear, \"Climb! Keep going! Don\u0027t look down!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll fall!\" I shriek. \"I\u0027ll drown!\"\\n\\n \"You will if you don\u0027t climb!\" he bellows, digging his chin hard into my neck.\\n\\n Since I\u0027ve no choice but to climb and risk death or stay and die for certain, I push my left hand up, searching for a handhold. After a second or two I find one and rest a moment, face turned away from the spray of the waves. Then I move my right hand up. My feet follow automatically, scrabbling for toeholds.\\n\\n Drust keeps his hand on me, steadying me by placing pressure on my shoulder, then my back, my bottom, my legs, finally my feet. When I move out of reach, he shouts at me to stop, then climbs up after me until we\u0027re level. Then it\u0027s my turn to lead again.\\n\\n That\u0027s how we progress, a small stretch of cliff at a time, dragging our way up, defying the angry howls of the sea, disturbing seagulls in their slumber. Drust only uses magic when I slip, to keep me hanging in the air momentarily, so that I can grab hold of a piece of rock again.\\n\\n I look down once and immediately wish I hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll never make it,\" I sob, feeling my strength ebb away, certain I\u0027ll collapse soon, not even able to keep myself going with magic.\\n\\n \"We will,\" Drust replies stubbornly, then pinches me to get me moving again.\\n\\n Finally, when I\u0027ve started to think this is a nightmare from which I\u0027ll never awake, we make it to the top and friendly hands pull us over the edge of the cliff, then carry us to our clothes. Fiachna has to help me slip into mine-my fingers are too numb to grasp and manipulate the material.\\n\\n They ask what happened, where we\u0027ve been, how we survived, what we saw. They were sure we\u0027d drowned. Their excitement at finding us alive makes them babble like children.\\n\\n Drust ignores the questions and pulls on his robes. I ignore them as well, too exhausted to provide answers. When we\u0027re fully dressed, the clothes deliriously warm on my cold-blue skin, Drust tells the others we need some time on our own. He marches me along the cliff to where a jutting rock shelters us from the wind. Settling behind it, Drust starts a fire using magic, makes it expand so the flames are three times their normal size, then sits staring into the heart of the blaze, saying nothing.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" I say eventually when I\u0027m warm enough to speak.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t,\" he replies. \"You wouldn\u0027t have come with me.\\n\\n \"I might.\"\\n\\n \"No. You wouldn\u0027t have trusted me. Nor would the others.\"\\n\\n \"So you were going to keep it secret?\" I snort. \"Not tell me until we got to the tunnel, then kill me without asking?\"\\n\\n \"Aye.\" He looks at me sideways, torn between arrogance and shame. \"That\u0027s part of the reason I was so hard on you to begin with. Yes, I needed to bring your magic out-you weren\u0027t powerful enough the way you were. But I also didn\u0027t want to get close to you because I knew I\u0027d have to...\"\\n\\n He stops and looks at the fire again.\\n\\n \"Was there another magician with you when you first set off?\" I ask.\\n\\n He nods. \"An apprentice. No grown druid would accompany me. As I told you before, they have no love for Christians and will be quite pleased if the Demonata take over this land. But I found an apprentice who was born here, whose family still live on these shores. He was happy to lay down his life if necessary.\"\\n\\n \"If?\" I sneer. \"You told him it might not be?\"\\n\\n Drust blushes. \"I said there might be other ways. It wasn\u0027t a total lie. Until I asked the Old Creatures, I still hoped...\" He trails off into silence.\\n\\n \"Is it truly the only way?\" I murmur after a while.\\n\\n \"So the Old Creatures said,\" he sighs.\\n\\n \"They couldn\u0027t be wrong?\" He shakes his head. \"Then we must go there and you must kill me,\" I mutter, and his neck practically snaps as his head lifts sharply.\\n\\n \"What?\" he gasps.\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s the only way to close the tunnel, we must do it.\"\\n\\n \"You mean you\u0027ll let me...\" He stops and scratches his head. \"Why? Now that you know, you don\u0027t have to come. You can flee, sail for safe lands to the east. With your power, you could become a priestess of high standing or even a druid. There\u0027s never been a female druid, but you can control male magic, so perhaps you\u0027d be the first. You don\u0027t have to stay-or die.\"\\n\\n I stare at him as if he\u0027s insane. \"But the tunnel would remain open,\" I say slowly. \"The demon masters would cross. They\u0027d kill everyone, then make them walk around as undead slaves. I can\u0027t let that happen.\"\\n\\n \"Even if it means your own death?\" Drust asks.\\n\\n \"Of course.\" I frown. \"Why do you ask me this? You feel the same way. Otherwise why come on this quest and risk your life?\"\\n\\n He shifts uncomfortably. \"My reasons are not the same as yours. These aren\u0027t my people, so I don\u0027t really care whether they live or die. And I never planned to perish. The risks were high but I hoped-still hope-to get out of here alive. But if you go on, it\u0027s to certain death, one way or the other. How can you do that?\"\\n\\n \"How can I not?\" I reply simply. \"One life is nothing when measured against thousands. I\u0027d give it a dozen times over to save the lives of those I care about.\"\\n\\n \"And those you don\u0027t know, who mean nothing to you?\"\\n\\n \"Aye.\"\\n\\n Drust chuckles darkly. \"A teacher of mine once said we druids knew nothing of ordinary people, that we\u0027d been apart from them so long, we couldn\u0027t understand them anymore. I didn\u0027t agree, but I see now that he was wiser than me. Your way of thinking is opposite to ours. No druid would throw away his life to save others. Some let themselves be sacrificed when they believe it will lead to greater power in the Otherworld. But I know none who\u0027d offer themselves as you have.\"\\n\\n \"Then they\u0027re fools,\" I tell him. \"A single person is nothing. Only the clan matters.\"\\n\\n Drust shakes his head again. \"So different,\" he mumbles, then looks at me with fresh respect. \"Very well, Bec. Our quest continues, even though I believe it\u0027s doomed and we won\u0027t make the tunnel in time. But if we do, you know what must be done?\"\\n\\n \"Aye.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll accept my guidance, follow my orders, let me kill you?\"\\n\\n A short pause. Then, softly but firmly, \"Aye.\"\\n\\n \"You are a true hero.\" He smiles wanly. \"Now get some sleep, little girl. We must leave as soon as possible, but we\u0027re in no condition to march tonight. We\u0027ll wait for morning, then make our way east as quickly as we can.\"\\n\\n \"Is it all right if I sleep with the others?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re tired of my company?\" Before I can answer, he grunts, \"Of course. They\u0027re your people. Spend as much time with them as you wish.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" I rise and make my way around the rock, bowing my head against the wind. As I round the rock there\u0027s a noise, like hooves skittering over grass. I glance up but the wind and rain are in my eyes and it\u0027s a few seconds before I can see clearly. When I look, there\u0027s nothing nearby. I don\u0027t worry about it as I tramp back to camp-nothing can harm us here-but I wonder. Because if it wasn\u0027t my imagination, it was probably just a rabbit or fox. But it might have been a human-one who could move very, very fast...\\n\\n When I\u0027m back with the group, I ask Bran if he was listening to what Drust and I were saying. The boy smiles foolishly, as he normally does, and gabbles a few meaningless words. I feel uneasy about it as I settle down to sleep. Then Bran snuggles up beside me for warmth and murmurs, \"Flower,\" under his breath as he folds his arms around me.\\n\\n I laugh at myself, misgivings vanishing. It probably wasn\u0027t Bran I heard when I was coming back, only a wild animal.\\n\\n And even if it was him, what of it? We\u0027ve nothing to fear from Bran. What harm could a poor, innocent, muddled boy like him do?\\n\\n Drust addresses us early in the morning. He says the location of the tunnel has been revealed to him but doesn\u0027t mention the fact that I have to be sacrificed to close it. Then he outlines our main problem.\\n\\n \"The tunnel lies to the east of your village,\" he says. \"A march of at least a week, probably longer. But we only have two days and nights. Then the demon masters will break through and we\u0027re finished. It will be too late to repair the damage.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ve lost,\" Goll says softly. \"We came too late.\"\\n\\n \"Probably,\" Drust agrees. \"But we have to try. We\u0027ll push on as quickly as we can. Run in bursts. Use boats or rafts on rivers and streams where possible. And pray to the gods that the demons encounter some unexpected delay.\"\\n\\n \"What about magic?\" Fiachna asks. \"Can\u0027t you use that to make us go quicker?\" He\u0027s had a hard night. The demon poison from the bite has spread and the whole of his upper body is an ugly purple colour. He has the shakes and is sweating badly. I tried to cure him, without success. I asked Drust if he could help but he said this wasn\u0027t something he had any knowledge of.\\n\\n \"There are spells which would allow us to run much faster,\" Drust says. \"But they\u0027re incredibly tiring. They\u0027d let us push our bodies to their limits, but we could easily pass those limits without knowing and drop dead. If it was a matter of a day or two\u0027s march, I\u0027d risk it. But the distance is too great. When we\u0027re closer, we\u0027ll gamble. But not now.\"\\n\\n \"What if you cast the spell on only a few of us?\" Lorcan asks. \"We could provide rides for the rest of you.\"\\n\\n Drust blinks. \"Use you as horses?\" he says, astonished.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" the teenager shrugs. \"We\u0027ll die anyway if the demons break through. Bec and Bran are too small, and Fiachna\u0027s in no shape to carry anyone, but the rest of us could-\"\\n\\n \"Not me!\" Connla barks. \"I\u0027m not running myself dead for that damn druid!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d rather perish at the hands of demons?\" Goll asks coolly.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t-\" Connla starts to shout, then stops and growls. \"I mean, I\u0027d rather take my chances with the monsters. I trust them more than this one. You know where you stand with demons.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a fool,\" Goll says bluntly, then faces Drust. \"Even without our young king, Lorcan and I could carry you and Bec. And Bran could keep up, the speed he runs at. It means leaving Fiachna behind, but he\u0027ll probably die soon anyway.\" He grins bleakly at Fiachna. \"Sorry for being so blunt.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Fiachna wheezes, grinning back.\\n\\n \"Maybe Lorcan doesn\u0027t want to carry me,\" I say quietly, recalling his outburst the night before.\\n\\n Lorcan grumbles something, then raises his voice but keeps his eyes lowered. \"I was upset about losing Ronan. I reacted savagely and said things I didn\u0027t mean. I beg your pardon.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need to,\" I smile.\\n\\n Lorcan looks up, returns my smile, then squints at Drust. \"Well? Will it work?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Drust says and does some quick calculations. \"We could cover maybe half the distance in a day if we did it your way-but only if you ran non-stop, which would certainly mean your deaths.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind that,\" Goll snorts. \"If we get you halfway, it leaves you with a three- or four-day march. If you walk by night as well as day...\"\\n\\n \"We still won\u0027t be quick enough,\" Drust mutters. \"Bec and I could use magic to run faster after you died, but we\u0027d have to rest often, to arrive fit enough to cast our spells. It would take at least two days, making three in total. The demon masters will have crossed by then.\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027ve more hope this way,\" Lorcan notes. \"So we\u0027ll have to chance it. Aye?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re willing to make that sacrifice,\" Drust says slowly, \"then... aye.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re mad,\" Connla sneers. \"You\u0027ll kill yourselves for nothing instead of doing the wise thing.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s that?\" Goll enquires with all the sweetness of a bat\u0027s bite.\\n\\n Connla points west. \"We\u0027re on the coast, fools! Find a boat. Set sail. Get out of here before the demons slaughter you all.\"\\n\\n Goll shakes his head. \"I never had a high opinion of you but I wouldn\u0027t have expected this. Flee when there\u0027s a chance to save those we left behind? Run when there\u0027s a war to be fought? I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re of our people. I think Conn reared a changeling.\"\\n\\n \"Is that so?\" Connla growls, drawing his sword. \"Well, watch closely, old man, while this changeling rips your guts out and-\"\\n\\n \"Run fast!\"\\n\\n The shout jolts us all. Bran roared it at the top of his voice, which is louder than anyone expected. Lorcan, who was closest to him, has covered his ears with his hands and is grimacing.\\n\\n The strange boy from the crannog is glaring at us, hands on hips. \"Run fast,\" he repeats, stiffly this time, looking from one of us to the other like a brehon passing judgement on a pack of bickering complainants. Then he points at the scraggly pony in the distance-it survived the night-and says, in a tone which brooks no argument, \"Bubbly!\"\\n\\n Then he takes off, running as swiftly as he can, becoming a fast-moving speck within seconds. We stare after Bran, bewildered, then at each other. The heat of the moment has dwindled away and those who were arguing look embarrassed.\\n\\n \"Where do you think he\u0027s going?\" Fiachna asks of no one in particular.\\n\\n \"That boy\u0027s a mystery even to himself,\" Drust answers, then sighs and looks at Lorcan and Goll. \"But we can\u0027t wait here to wonder about him. If we\u0027re to set off as agreed, it\u0027s best we start now. If both of you are still sure...\"\\n\\n Goll and Lorcan nod. Drust beckons them forward. I see his lips move as he begins to cast a spell.\\n\\n \"Wait.\" I step between the warriors and Drust, my eyes on the far-off form of Bran. \"I think we should leave it a while.\"\\n\\n \"Bec, I know you care about us...\" Goll begins but I shake my head.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that. I think Bran has a plan. He can help us.\"\\n\\n \"How?\" Drust frowns. \"By being bubbly?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But my instinct tells me we should wait. We can march but we shouldn\u0027t cast any spells. Not until we see what Bran\u0027s up to.\"\\n\\n \"And if he\u0027s up to nothing?\" Drust asks. \"If he\u0027s simply running around for the sake of it, or because we upset him? If he never returns?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t answer that. I don\u0027t know. I just think it would be a mistake to use our magic now.\"\\n\\n Drust studies me in silence, troubled. The others are staring at me too, but it\u0027s clear from their expressions that they\u0027ll leave this decision to the druid.\\n\\n \"So be it,\" Drust huffs, then laughs. \"I must be as mad as the boy, but I\u0027ll go with your instinct. We\u0027ll leave the magic for a while. I\u0027m not setting a time limit but if I start to feel he\u0027s a lost cause, that\u0027s that. Agreed?\"\\n\\n I nod reluctantly and mutter a quick prayer under my breath that I\u0027m not wrong about the brain-addled Bran.\\n\\n We make good early progress, me riding piggyback on Lorcan. But Fiachna finds it hard to keep the pace. It\u0027s clear we\u0027ll have to leave him behind soon, to die alone in the wilderness. My heart weeps at the thought, as I remember my childish dreams of putting magic behind me and becoming his wife. But dreams are dreams and reality\u0027s reality. Few, if any, of us are going to survive the next few days. We can\u0027t be foolish about this. If Fiachna can\u0027t keep up, he must be abandoned.\\n\\n As I\u0027m thinking that, Fiachna stumbles-Goll has been half-supporting him-then slumps to the ground and rests, massaging his neck, which is pure purple. \"I\u0027m finished,\" he says quietly. \"Leave me.\"\\n\\n \"We could... if you want...\" Goll mumbles, touching the hilt of his sword.\\n\\n \"No.\" Fiachna smiles weakly. \"I\u0027d rather lie here, watch the clouds drift across the sky and die in my own, natural time. It\u0027s peaceful.\"\\n\\n \"But the pain?\" Goll enquires.\\n\\n \"Not so bad,\" Fiachna says. \"It was worse in the night. The fire\u0027s turned to ice. It still hurts but I can bear it.\"\\n\\n \"Very well.\" Goll salutes the blacksmith. Lorcan salutes too and so does Connla, though his salute is quick and disinterested.\\n\\n Drust spreads his hands over Fiachna. \"I will pray for your spirit. And, if we succeed, I\u0027ll tell people of your bravery and the debt they owe you.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Fiachna coughs, then shudders.\\n\\n I kneel beside him. A few weeks ago I would have fought not to cry. But now I let tears flow freely. I don\u0027t care how I\u0027m supposed to behave. I\u0027ll miss Fiachna dreadfully and I want him to know that.\\n\\n \"I could... if there\u0027s anything... I wish...\" I can\u0027t find suitable words. In the end I abandon speech, throw my arms around Fiachna and kiss him fully, a kiss between a woman and a man. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever kissed someone this way. It will also probably be the last.\\n\\n Fiachna smiles when I break the embrace. \"I had my eye on you for a few years, Little One. If you hadn\u0027t been a priestess...\" He touches my left cheek with cold, trembling fingers. \"Perhaps in the Otherworld?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll pray for it,\" I sob, then rise and stumble away, wiping tears from my cheeks, not looking back for fear I\u0027d crumble completely and beg to stay with him. There\u0027s no time for that. He must die by himself on this miserable day if we are to press on and prevent many more from dying soon after.\\n\\n I hear Lorcan ask, \"Do you need a weapon?\"\\n\\n Fiachna replies, \"No. I have my knife. If I\u0027m not dead by nightfall, and the demons come, that will take care of the job.\"\\n\\n Then I\u0027m gone. The others soon come after me-Connla among them, although I half-expected him to part from us here-our ranks lessened by the fall of yet one more much-loved friend.\\n\\n An hour later. Jogging steadily. Silent, thoughts heavy, wondering if Fiachna has succumbed to the disease yet or is still clinging on. Then noises from the far side of a hill. Like the growing sound of thunder, only coming from the ground, not the sky. We look around, puzzled. Then Connla gasps, \"Horses!\"\\n\\n Moments later they appear, galloping over the hill, seven of them. Six are bareback. On the seventh, a rider-Bran! He laughs as the horses surge around us and come to a stop. He hops off and beams, pointing to the steeds. \"Bubbly,\" he says proudly. \"Run fast!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe it!\" Goll howls with delight.\\n\\n \"Will the spells work on them?\" I ask Drust quickly.\\n\\n \"Aye.\" He smiles softly with wonder. \"And they can run much quicker than we could. We\u0027ll be able to rest them every few hours and still make great time.\"\\n\\n \"Enough?\" I ask. \"Will we get to the tunnel before...?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly,\" Drust says. \"But let\u0027s not waste precious minutes talking about it. Mount up!\"\\n\\n As Goll puts me atop one of the smaller horses-I\u0027ve never been on one before, so I\u0027m nervous-and the other men mount theirs, Bran looks for Fiachna.\\n\\n \"Drust,\" I call, then nod backwards. \"Could we...?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no point,\" Drust says as kindly as he can. \"Whether he dies on the ground or on horseback, he\u0027ll surely die, if he hasn\u0027t already.\"\\n\\n I think about that and how hard it would be to bid Fiachna farewell a second time. I nod sadly, shedding a few-fresh tears.\\n\\n \"Do you want a horse?\" Goll grunts at Connla.\\n\\n The arrogant warrior stares back haughtily. \"Why wouldn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"I thought, from what you said earlier, you might have other plans. You don\u0027t need a horse to get to the coast or hunt for a boat.\"\\n\\n Connla sneers. \"I never said I was leaving. I simply said it would be the wise thing for the rest of you to do. I\u0027m not one for running away from a challenge.\" And, with Goll staring at him in disbelief, he leaps up on one of the horse\u0027s backs and sits there regally, looking calmer and more relaxed than any of us.\\n\\n Drust works his spell-I help, once he\u0027s demonstrated on the first horse-and moments later we\u0027re off. The seventh, riderless horse runs along behind us, but we\u0027re going too fast for it, sped along by magic. It soon gives up and turns aside to head back wherever it came from, leaving us to charge across the land ahead of even the jealous wind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-17.html","bookId":2178,"book":{"id":2178,"title":"Bec (The Demonata #4)","description":"Storyline: Bec (The Demonata #4) \\n The fourth novel in this bonechilling series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. \\n As demonic Fomorii ravage their land, Bec and a band of warrior companions leave their devastated rath to answer a plea for help.
