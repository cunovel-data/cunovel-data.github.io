{"id":101098,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Preparations for the feast are at an advanced stage, and the sun is close to setting, when there\u0027s a call from another lookout. \"I see someone in the distance running towards us!\"\n Conn raises an eyebrow at Tiernan. They\u0027ve been talking about their battles with the demons. I\u0027ve sat in close attendance. Our seanachaidh fled not long after the attacks began, so I\u0027ve been charged with keeping the history of the clan. I\u0027m no natural storyteller but I\u0027ve a perfect memory.\n \"It\u0027s not one of ours,\" Tiernan says. \"We brought all our living with us.\"\n \"Is it a demon?\" Conn shouts at the lookout.\n \"It doesn\u0027t look like one,\" comes the reply. \"I think it\u0027s a boy. But the speed at which he\u0027s running... I\u0027m not sure.\"\n Conn returns to the rampart with Tiernan and a few of our warriors. I slip up behind them. I normally avoid the exposure of the higher ground, but a lone demon in daylight can\u0027t pose much of a threat.\n As the figure races closer, we see that it\u0027s a boy, my age or slightly older, running incredibly fast, head bobbing about strangely. He lopes up to the gate, ignoring Conn\u0027s shouts to identify himself, then stops and looks at us dumbly. Dark hair and small eyes. He smiles widely, even though Conn is roaring at him, threatening to stick a spear through his heart if he doesn\u0027t announce his intentions. Then he sits, picks a flower and plays with it.\n Conn looks angry but confused. \"A simpleton,\" he grunts.\n \"It could be a trap,\" Tiernan mutters.\n \"Demons don\u0027t send humans to lay traps,\" Conn disagrees.\n \"But you saw how fast he ran,\" Tiernan says. \"And he doesn\u0027t look tired. He\u0027s not even sweating. Maybe he\u0027s not human.\"\n \"Bec,\" Conn calls, \"do you sense anything?\"\n I close my eyes and focus on the boy. Demons have a different feel to humans. They buzz with the power of their own world. There\u0027s a flicker of that about this child. I start to tell Conn but then something strange happens. I sense a change in the boy. Opening my eyes, I see that the light around him is different. It\u0027s like looking at him through a thick bank of mist. As I squint, I realise the boy is no longer there. Instead, I\u0027m staring at my mother.\n There\u0027s no mistaking her. I\u0027ve seen her so many times in my perfect memories. She looks just like she did on the day she gave birth to me-the day she died. Haggard, bone-thin, dark circles under her eyes, stained with blood. But love in her eyes-love for me.\n As I stare, numb with wonder-but no fear-my mother turns and points west, keeping her eyes on mine. She says something but her words don\u0027t carry. With a frown, she jabs a long finger towards the west. She starts to say something else but then the mist clears. She shimmers. I blink. And I\u0027m suddenly looking at the boy again, playing with his flower.\n \"Bec,\" Conn is saying, shaking me lightly. \"Are you all right?\"\n I look up, trembling, and think about telling Conn what I saw. Then I decide against it. I\u0027ve never had a vision before. I need time to think about it before I discuss it with anyone. Focusing on the boy, I control my breathing and try to calm my fast heartbeat.\n \"I th-think he\u0027s hu-human,\" I stutter. \"But not the same as us. There\u0027s magic in him. Maybe he\u0027s a druid\u0027s apprentice.\" That\u0027s a wild guess, but it\u0027s the closest I can get to explaining what\u0027s different about him.\n \"Does he pose a threat?\" Conn asks.\n A dangerous question-if I answer wrongly, I\u0027ll be held responsible. I think about playing safe and saying I don\u0027t know, but then the boy pulls a petal from the flower and slowly places it on his outstretched tongue. \"No,\" I say confidently. \"He can\u0027t harm us.\"\n The gate is opened. Several of us spill out and surround the boy. I\u0027ve been brought along in case he doesn\u0027t speak our language. A priestess is meant to have the gift of tongues. I don\u0027t actually know any other languages but I don\u0027t see the need to admit that, not unless somebody asks me directly-and so far nobody has. I keep hoping he\u0027ll change and become my mother again, but he doesn\u0027t.\n The boy is thin and dirty, his hair thick and unwashed, his knee-length tunic caked with mud, no cloak or sandals. His eyes dart left and right, never lingering on any one spot for more than a second. He\u0027s carrying a long knife in a scabbard hanging from his belt but he doesn\u0027t reach for it or show-alarm as we gather round him.\n \"Boy!\" Conn barks, nudging the boy\u0027s knee with his foot. No reaction. \"Boy! Who are you? What are you doing here?\"\n The boy doesn\u0027t answer. Conn opens his mouth to shout again, then stops. He looks at me and nods. Licking my lips nervously, I crouch beside the strange child. I watch him play with the flower, noting the movements of his eyes and head. I no longer think he\u0027s a druid\u0027s assistant. Conn was right-he\u0027s a simpleton. But one who\u0027s been blessed in some way by the gods.\n \"That\u0027s a nice flower,\" I murmur.\n The boy\u0027s gaze settles on me for an instant and he grins, then thrusts the flower at me. When I take it, he picks another and holds it above his head, squinting at it.\n \"Can you speak?\" I ask. \"Do you talk?\"\n No answer. I\u0027m about to ask again, when he shouts loudly, \"Flower!\"\n I jump at the sound of his voice. So do the men around me. Then we laugh, embarrassed. The boy looks at us, delighted. \"Flower!\" he shouts again. Then his smile dwindles. \"Demons. Killing. Come with.\" He leaps to his feet. \"Come with! Run fast!\"\n \"Wait,\" I shush him. \"It\u0027s almost night. We can\u0027t go anywhere. The demons will be on the move soon.\"\n \"Demons!\" he cries. \"Killing. Come with!\" He grabs my hand and hauls me up.\n \"Wait,\" I tell him again, losing my patience. \"What\u0027s your name? Where are you from? Why should we trust you?\" The boy stares at me blankly. I take a deep breath, then ask slowly, \"What\u0027s your name?\" No answer. \"Where are you from?\" Nothing. I turn to Conn and shrug. \"He\u0027s simple. He probably escaped from his village and-\"\n \"Come with!\" the boy shouts. \"Run fast! Demons!\"\n \"Bec\u0027s right,\" Connla snorts. \"Why would anyone send a fool like this to-\"\n \"Run fast!\" the boy gasps before Connla can finish. \"Run fast!\" he repeats, his face lighting up. He tears away from us, breaks through the ranks of warriors as if they were reeds and races around the rath. Seconds later he\u0027s back, not panting, just smiling. \"Run fast,\" he says firmly.\n \"Do you know where you\u0027re from, Run Fast?\" Goll asks, giving the boy a name since he can\u0027t provide one himself. \"Can you find your way back to your people?\"\n For a moment the boy gawps at Goll. I don\u0027t think he understands. But then he nods, looks to where the sun is setting and points west. \"Pig\u0027s trotters,\" he says thoughtfully.\n For a second I see my mother pointing that same way again, but this is just a memory, not another vision.\n Goll faces Conn. \"We should bring him in. It\u0027ll be dark soon. We can question him inside, though I doubt we\u0027ll get much more out of him.\"\n Conn hesitates, judging the possible danger to his people, then clicks his fingers and leaves the boy to his men, returning to the fireside with Tiernan, to discuss this latest turn of events.\n Run Fast isn\u0027t big but he has the appetite of a boar. He eats more than anyone at the feast but nobody minds. There\u0027s something cheering about the boy. He makes us all feel good, even though he can\u0027t talk properly, except to explode every so often with \"Demons!\" or \"Come with!\" or-his favourite-\"Run fast!\"\n As Goll predicted, Run Fast isn\u0027t able to tell us any more about his clan, where he lives or how great their need is. Under normal circumstances he\u0027d be ignored. We\u0027ve enough problems to cope with. But the mood of the rath is lighter than it\u0027s been in a long while. The arrival of the MacCadan has sparked confidence. Even though the eleven are more of a burden than a blessing, they\u0027ve given us hope. If survivors from other clans make their way here, perhaps we can build a great fort and a mighty army, keep the demons out forever. It\u0027s wishful, crazy thinking, but we think it anyway. Banba used to say that the desperate and damned could build a mountain of hope out of a rat\u0027s droppings.\n So we grant Run Fast more thought than we would have last night. The men debate his situation, where he\u0027s from, how long it might have taken him to come here, why a fool was sent instead of another.\n \"His speed is the obvious reason,\" Goll says. \"Better to send a hare with half a message than a snail with a full one.\"\n \"Or maybe the Fomorii sent him,\" Tiernan counters, his bony, wrinkled fingers twitching with suspicion. \"They could have conquered his clan, then muddled his senses and sent him to lure others into a trap.\"\n \"You afford them too much respect,\" Conn says. \"The Fomorii we\u0027ve fought are mindless, dim-witted creatures.\"\n \"Aye,\" Tiernan agrees. \"So were ours to begin with. But they\u0027ve changed. They\u0027re getting more intelligent. We had a craftily hidden souterrain. One or two would find their way into it by accident every so often, but recently they attacked through it regularly, in time with those at the fence. They were thinking and planning clearly, more like humans in the way they battled.\"\n Conn massages his chin thoughtfully. Our one great advantage over the demons-besides the fact they can only attack at night-is that we\u0027re smarter than them. But if there are others, brighter than those we\u0027ve encountered...\n \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a trap,\" Fiachna says quietly. He doesn\u0027t normally say much, so everyone\u0027s surprised to hear him speak. He\u0027s been sitting next to Run Fast, examining the boy\u0027s knife. \"This boy doesn\u0027t have the scent of demons on him. Am I right, Bec?\"\n I nod immediately, delighted to be publicly noticed by Fiachna. \"Not a bit of a scent,\" I gush, rather more breathlessly than I meant.\n \"He\u0027s telling the truth,\" Fiachna says. \"His people need help. Run Fast was the best they could send. So they sent him, probably in blind hope.\"\n \"What of it?\" Connla snorts. I can tell by the way he\u0027s eyeing Run Fast that he doesn\u0027t like him. \"We need help too. Our plight\u0027s as serious as theirs. What do they expect us to do-send our men to fight their battles, leaving our women and children at the mercy of the Fomorii?\" He spits into the dust.\n \"He puts it harshly but there\u0027s wisdom in what my son says,\" Conn murmurs. \"Alliances are one thing, but begging for help like slaves... asking us to go to their aid instead of coming to us...\"\n \"Perhaps they can\u0027t travel,\" Goll says. \"Many might be wounded or old.\"\n \"In which case they\u0027re not worth saving,\" Connla laughs. Those who follow him laugh too- wolves copying the example of their pack leader.\n \"We should go,\" Goll growls. \"Or at least send an envoy. If we ignore their pleas, perhaps ours will also be ignored when we seek assistance.\"\n \"Only the weak ask for help,\" Connla says stiffly.\n Goll smiles tightly and I sense what he\u0027s going to say next-something along the lines of, \"Well, it won\u0027t be long before you ask then!\"\n Luckily Conn senses it too, and before Goll utters an insult which will demand payment in blood, the king says, \"Even if we wanted to help, we don\u0027t know where they are, and I don\u0027t trust this empty-headed child to find his way back.\"\n \"If the brehons were here, they could counsel us,\" Fiachna says.\n \"Brehons!\" Connla snorts. \"Weren\u0027t they the first to flee when the demons arose? Damn the brehons!\"\n There are mutters of agreement, even from those who don\u0027t normally side with Connla. The law-making brehons deserted us when we most needed them and few are in the mood to forgive and forget.\n The men continue debating, the women sitting silently behind them, their children sleeping or playing games. On the rampart the lookouts keep watch for demons.\n Goll and Fiachna are of the opinion that we should send a small group with Run Fast to help his clan. \"It\u0027s no accident that he arrived on the same day as the MacCadan,\" Goll argues. \"Yesterday we couldn\u0027t have let anyone go. But our ranks have been bolstered. It\u0027s a sign.\"\n \"Bolstered?\" Connla almost shrieks, casting a scornful glance at the four men and three women of the MacCadan.\n \"Connla!\" his father snaps, before the hot-headed warrior disgraces our guests. When he\u0027s sure of his son\u0027s silence, Conn leans forward, sipping coirm, thinking hard. Like any king, he dare not ignore a possible sign from the gods. But he\u0027s not sure this is a sign. And in a situation such as this, there\u0027s only one person he can turn to. \"Bec?\"\n I was expecting his query, so I\u0027m able to keep a calm face. I\u0027ve had time to consider my answer. I believe we\u0027re meant to go with Run Fast. That was what the vision meant. The spirit of my mother was telling me to follow this boy.\n \"We should help,\" I whisper. Connla rolls his eyes but I ignore him. \"We\u0027re stronger now, thanks to the MacCadan. We can spare a few of our warriors. I believe Run Fast can find his way back to his people, and I think bad luck would befall us if we refused their plea.\"\n Conn nods slowly. \"But who to send? I don\u0027t want to command anyone to leave. Are there volunteers...?\"\n \"Aye,\" Goll says instantly. \"Since I argued the case, I have to go.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go too,\" Fiachna says quietly.\n \"You?\" Conn frowns. \"But you\u0027re not a warrior.\"\n Fiachna holds up Run Fast\u0027s knife. \"This metal is unfamiliar to me. It\u0027s tougher than our own, yet lighter. If I knew the secret of it, I could make better weapons.\" He lowers the knife. \"I\u0027ll stay if you order it, but I want to go.\"\n \"Very well,\" Conn sighs. \"But you\u0027ll travel with a guard.\" He looks around to choose a warrior to send with the smith. There are many to pick from, but he\u0027s loath to send a husband or father. So it must be one of the younger warriors. As he studies them, his expression changes and a crafty look comes into his eyes. He points to Connla. \"My son will protect you.\"\n Connla gawps at his father. Others are surprised too. This quest is a perilous one. The land is full of demons. The chances of survival are slim. Yet Conn\u0027s telling his own flesh and blood to leave the safety of the rath and serve as guard to a smith. Most can\u0027t see the wisdom of it.\n But I can. Conn wants his son to succeed him. But Connla is largely untested in battle and not everyone respects him. If Conn died tonight, there would be several challengers to replace him and Connla might find powerful allies hard to come by. But if he completes this task and returns with a bloodied blade and tales of glory, that would change. This could be the making of him.\n And if the quest goes poorly and he dies? Well, that will be the decision of the gods. You can\u0027t fight your destiny.\n While Connla blinks stupidly at his father, the teenage twins, Ronan and Lorcan rise. \"We\u0027ll go too,\" Ronan says, brushing blood-red hair out of his eyes.\n \"We want to kill more demons,\" Lorcan adds, tugging an earring, excited.\n Conn growls unhappily. The twins are young but they\u0027re two of our finest warriors. He doesn\u0027t want to let them go but he can\u0027t refuse without insulting them. In the end he nods reluctantly. \"Any others?\" he asks.\n \"Me,\" a woman of the MacCadan says, taking a step forward. \"Orna MacCadan. I\u0027ll represent my clan, to repay you for your hospitality.\" Orna is the female warrior I spotted earlier.\n Conn smiles. \"Our thanks. Now, if that\u0027s all...\" He looks for any final volunteers, making it clear by the way he asks that he thinks six is more than adequate.\n But one last hand goes up. A tiny hand. Mine.\n \"I want to go too.\"\n Conn\u0027s astonished. Everybody is.\n \"Bec,\" Goll says, \"this isn\u0027t suitable for a child.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a child,\" I retort. \"I\u0027m a priestess. Well, an apprentice priestess.\"\n \"It will be dangerous,\" Fiachna warns me. \"This is a task for warriors.\"\n \"You\u0027re going,\" I remind him, \"but you\u0027re no warrior.\"\n \"I have to go in case there\u0027s a smith in this village, who can teach me to make better weapons,\" he says.\n \"Maybe I can learn something too,\" I reply, then face Conn. \"I need to do this. I sense failure if I don\u0027t go. I\u0027m not sure what good I can do-maybe none at all-but I believe I must travel with them.\"\n Conn shakes his head, troubled. \"I can\u0027t allow this. With Banba gone, you\u0027re our only link to the ways of magic. We need you.\"\n \"You need Fiachna too,\" I cry, \"but you\u0027re letting him go.\"\n \"Fiachna\u0027s a man,\" Conn says sternly. \"He has the right to choose.\"\n \"So do I,\" I growl, then raise my voice and repeat it, with conviction this time. \"So do I! We of magic live by our own rules. I was Banba\u0027s charge, not yours. She lived here by choice, as do I-neither of us were of this clan. You had no power over her and you don\u0027t have any over me. Since she\u0027s dead, I\u0027m my own guardian. I answer to a higher voice than any here and that voice tells me to go. If you hold me, it will be against my will and the will of the gods.\"\n Brave, provocative words, which Conn can\u0027t ignore. Although I\u0027m no more a real priestess than any of the cows in the fields, I\u0027m closer to the ways of magic than anybody else in the rath. Nobody dares cross me on this.\n \"Very well,\" Conn says angrily. \"We\u0027ve pledged an ex-king, our smith, two of our best warriors, a guest and my own son to this reckless cause-why not our young priestess too!\"\n And so, in a bitter, resentful fashion, my fate is decided and I\u0027m dismissed. With a mix of fear and excitement-mostly fear-I trudge back to my hut to enjoy one final night of sheltered sleep, before leaving home in the morning, to face the demons and other dangers of the world beyond. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-4.html","bookId":2178,"book":{"id":2178,"title":"Bec (The Demonata #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Bec (The Demonata #4) \n The fourth novel in this bonechilling series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. \n As demonic Fomorii ravage their land, Bec and a band of warrior companions leave their devastated rath to answer a plea for help.
