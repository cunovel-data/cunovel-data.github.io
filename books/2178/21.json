{"id":99557,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Trying to race to safety. Hindered by the wind, which is returning to its source, blowing fiercely against us, a gale in the tunnel. And not just the wind-it contains all the demons and undead which it\u0027s captured. They swirl and tumble through the air, smash into us, knock us over, send us sprawling, threaten to drag us back to their world with them.\n Abandoning our efforts to stand, we lie on our stomachs and crawl, side by side. But even this would be impossible if we were normal, since the wind-and its captive demons-fills the tunnel.\n But we\u0027re not normal. We\u0027re beings of magic and I use that power to protect us. I draw from deep down and around me, using the magic in my body and the walls of the tunnel, creating a barrier around us. It doesn\u0027t keep out the wind, but most of the demons bounce off it without harming us. Most, not all. Sometimes a limb, claw or fang breaks through and bundles us over, bruising or cutting us.\n Bran was laughing when we started up the tunnel-he thought it was great fun. He\u0027s not laughing now. Blood coats his face-I can see him in the glow of the light I created to guide us-and his right arm hangs uselessly by his side, snapped in two or three places.\n I\u0027m in no better shape. I have to pause frequently to wipe blood from my eyes. A few of the toes on my left foot have been ripped off-I don\u0027t stop for a close examination. The tunic on my back has been torn to tattered shreds and much of the flesh underneath too.\n I ignore the terrible pain. Battle against the savage wind. Shrug off the blows of the beastly demons. And drag myself ever further up the tunnel, towards the promise of escape and life.\n Crawling. Panting. The demons hitting us more often as my power dwindles. The closing spells took a lot out of me. I was all-powerful clutching the lodestone, but now I\u0027m the weakest I\u0027ve been in a long time. It\u0027s a struggle to move, never mind cast spells. I want to abandon the shield and divert all of my strength to my flesh and bones, but I\u0027d be swept away within seconds if I did that, and Bran beside me.\n Part of me thinks about letting Bran go. It\u0027s hard enough protecting myself. If I halved the problem, I\u0027d stand a better chance of getting out alive.\n I turn a deaf ear to the treacherous thoughts, gasp as nails dig along the length of my spine, then strengthen the shield around us. At the same time I let the light die-it didn\u0027t require much power, but every last bit of magic might count in the end. I don\u0027t want to fall just short of the exit because of some unnecessary ball of light.\n Impossible to tell in the darkness how much further there is to go. Forcing our way on, the wind deafening, demons striking freely. I can\u0027t maintain the shield. I now use magic to root us to the floor when we\u0027re struck and on the point of being blown away. Quick bursts instead of extended spells. Dangerous-if I\u0027m knocked unconscious, we\u0027re doomed-but I don\u0027t have the strength for anything else.\n How long is this damn tunnel! We came down so quickly-or was that a trick of my mind? What if it has somehow extended, if Brude caused it to double or triple in length to spite us? Is that possible? I don\u0027t know. I choose to believe it isn\u0027t. Otherwise despair will consume me and I\u0027ll certainly fail.\n Onwards by slow, painful, bloody, hard-fought-for patches. So sore and weak. Struggling to breathe. Every spell dug up from the deepest depths of my spirit. Thinking each time I cast one,\n \"This is it. The last spell. I can\u0027t do any more.\" But constantly surprising myself, finding a smattering of power here, a glimmer there.\n Barely aware of Bran, sticking by me doggedly, patting my arm every few seconds to reassure himself that I\u0027m here. Poor Bran. He didn\u0027t ask for this. The rest of us understood the risks. Did he? No way of knowing. He can comprehend some things, but how much did he really know of what he was letting himself in for? I listen to him panting, heavy and fast, and...\n The thought dies unfinished.\n I can hear him panting. But I haven\u0027t been able to hear anything since we started crawling, because of the roar of the wind and screams of the demons. I raise my head and realise the wind has died away. It\u0027s over. Which means...\n Panicking, I find another burst of magic and create light again. It flares around us, blinding after the darkness. I shut my eyes against it, then force them open and stare ahead desperately, expecting to find nothing but rock, the pair of us buried alive, to die beneath the earth in a ready-made tomb.\n For a moment I think we\u0027re lost, that we\u0027ve won the battle but surrendered our lives in the process. My heart sinks. I ready myself to sob with terror.\n But then-a gap! The exit still exists and we\u0027re close to it. The walls are just walls now, no traces of Brude\u0027s veins or guts. But they\u0027re grinding together, the mouth of the tunnel tightening and closing. There\u0027s enough space for us to get out but there won\u0027t be for much longer. We have to move! - fast! - now!\n \"Bran!\" I gasp, struggling to my feet. So weak, near the end of my resources. But one last surge. One final effort. Then we\u0027ll be safe. We can sleep. Recover. No demons. We\u0027ll have all the time we need.\n \"Bran!\" I shout, dragging his head up. He looks around, dazed, defeated. Then he spots the opening and cries out with fresh hope. He leaps up beside me, stumbles, then finds his feet and lurches forward, taking my hand, gurgling happily.\n We reel towards the exit, a pair of barely living, impossibly weary spirits. The hole in the rock continues to close, but at the same regular pace. If we keep moving as we are... if we don\u0027t collapse... if we don\u0027t give up...\n We\u0027ll make it! I don\u0027t want to let myself hope too strongly-that might tempt the gods to act against us-but if we can maintain our slow, steady stagger, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll-\n Something clatters into my back. I fall, crying out with pain and surprise. Teeth lock around my right leg and bite through to the bone. I scream and try to shake my attacker loose, but can\u0027t.\n The light fades. But in the dimness I catch sight of my assailant-Lord Loss\u0027s pet demon, Vein! The one with a dog\u0027s body, strange long head and a woman\u0027s hands. She\u0027s gnawing at my leg. The pain is dreadful. I scream again, kicking at her with my free foot, to no effect.\n Then Bran\u0027s by her side. He tries to tug the demon loose. When that fails, he kneels beside her and murmurs desperately, stroking her head, smiling shakily. After a few seconds Vein stops biting, lets go and yaps at Bran with delight, falling under his spell as she did before.\n As soon as I\u0027m free, I freeze out the pain, leave Bran to deal with the demon, and turn and focus on the gap. My insides harden. The delay\u0027s ruined us. The hole has been narrowing steadily. We\u0027re not going to make it, even if we pick up our pace. I search within myself, digging deep for magic, going to the very core of my spirit, trying to find enough power to propel us forward and shoot us to safety like a pair of arrows fired from a bow.\n But it isn\u0027t there. I\u0027m magicked out. Enough for one last minor spell perhaps-definitely no more.\n Sorrow overwhelms me. I feel madness coming on. But I force it back and turn my gaze on Bran. He\u0027s still playing with the dog but his eyes are flicking from me to the hole. He knows it\u0027s closing. He knows I can\u0027t make it in my condition. He also knows that at the speed he can run, he could abandon me and escape.\n But he won\u0027t. He\u0027s going to stay with me, protect me from the demon, keep me company as the gap shuts and seals our fate.\n \"Bran,\" I sob. \"You have to go.\" He just smiles. \"Bran! You must!\" Again the smile. He won\u0027t leave. He\u0027ll be my faithful friend forever. He\u0027d rather die by my side than skip free without me.\n I return the smile. \"Very well,\" I sigh and reach out a hand. Bran takes it, expecting only my touch. But what he gets on top of that is the last of my magic. A swift, improvised spell. I reach into his mind and send an image into his thoughts, of the hole, him dashing out of it, racing through the cave and not coming back. And then, with all the magical force I can muster, I yell at him-\"Run fast!\"\n He shoots off. Running without meaning to, roaring with surprise and fright. He flies up the tunnel, leaps through the hole and keeps on going, a temporary slave of my magic. I wave after him sadly, letting out a long, shuddering breath. Alone at last-and damned.\n I expect Vein to attack again, now that Bran\u0027s gone, but she doesn\u0027t. I hear her growls, close to where I\u0027m stranded, but for some reason she leaves me be.\n Watching the hole in the ever-fading light. It\u0027s the size of a baby now, closing all the time. Narrower and narrower, until there\u0027s barely room to fit an arm through. I\u0027m thinking about quenching the light before the hole shuts-this is just torture-when a face suddenly appears.\n It\u0027s Bran. The spell has passed and he\u0027s come back. He wants to get through, to be with me. But the hole\u0027s too small. He punches it, pulls at it, slips his fingers into the gap and strains with all his might-but it\u0027s no good. The rock continues to grind together. The hole gets smaller, the width of a finger now.\n At the last moment, Bran presses his mouth up to the hole and roars with raw pain and loss, at the top of his voice, \"Bec!\" It\u0027s the only time he\u0027s ever uttered my name. Anyone\u0027s name. His anguished cry stabs at my heart and tears spring to my eyes. I open my mouth to shout his own name back, to offer whatever small shred of comfort I can... but then the rock closes all the way and a fierce rumbling drowns out the echoes of Bran\u0027s cry.\n I stare at the solid rock. My mouth closes. The light fades. Darkness. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-21.html","bookId":2178,"book":{"id":2178,"title":"Bec (The Demonata #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Bec (The Demonata #4) \n The fourth novel in this bonechilling series by Darren Shan, author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series, will keep readers turning page after horrifying page. \n As demonic Fomorii ravage their land, Bec and a band of warrior companions leave their devastated rath to answer a plea for help.
