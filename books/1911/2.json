{"id":87888,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Marcus had walked to the end of the parking lot at the edge of the barn and storage area. He now stood looking out at the pasture where the cow raised her head and stared at him. She chewed her cud, as perplexed by him as he seemed mesmerized by her.\\n\\n \"You son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n Marcus glanced at him as Thomas stepped over the curb and crossed the grass to the fence. \"An accurate statement, based on what I know of my mother.\"\\n\\n \"What is this?\" Thomas waved the check. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" The ache in his chest was suffocating him. He stopped three paces away because - God help him - he didn\u0027t trust himself closer. He might go to his knees and beg, and he didn\u0027t know for what. He was the one who\u0027d walked away, and nothing had changed about the situation. If anything, it had gotten worse, confirming that he\u0027d made the right decision.\\n\\n \"This is the cow.\" When Marcus turned fully to study him, Thomas had to lock his jaw and plant his feet to meet his gaze. \"The one you mentioned the day I said you wouldn\u0027t be able to sell a picture in my gallery with a cow in it. You told me not only would it sell, I could put it up for auction and people would try to outbid one another for it.\"\\n\\n Marcus, always one to take a challenge, had agreed he\u0027d put the painting up at the next auction. Which had never happened because Thomas left. Thomas forced himself to respond. \"Yes, that\u0027s her. Kate. Her name is Kate. Les named her.\"\\n\\n \"I should hope so. Else you would have been outed long ago. No straight farm boy names his cow, after all.\"\\n\\n The slight edge to Marcus\u0027 tone helped Thomas remember the point. He lifted the check. \"What is this?\"\\n\\n \"I told you. It\u0027s your percentage. All of the pieces sold. Even the sculpture, though we both know that\u0027s not your best medium. Oils. In your hands, they can become anything.\"\\n\\n As Marcus\u0027 attention drifted to his mouth, lingered, Thomas couldn\u0027t bear it. He crushed the check in his fist.\\n\\n \"Bullshit. Total bullshit. No way an unknown - hell, one who hadn\u0027t even gotten his Master of Fine Arts yet - would get this kind of money. It\u0027s you. Your signature, your gallery. There were no buyers. You think you can buy me into being something I can\u0027t be, like some boy whore you picked up on the street?\" Marcus\u0027 green eyes rose, narrowed. \"Do you think I\u0027m that desperate, pet?\"\\n\\n No. He didn\u0027t think Marcus was desperate at all, whereas Thomas was going to choke on his own misery if he stood here another moment looking at what he wanted so much and couldn\u0027t have. Please God, just let him vanish and be one of those million dreams I\u0027ve had of him before I do something stupid.\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t desperate. But you\u0027re used to getting what you want. That\u0027s all this is about. You don\u0027t want me. You just can\u0027t stand that I walked away. I should have expected you sooner. Keep your money, and like I told you then, keep those pieces.\\n\\n Burn them, toss them in the trash. It doesn\u0027t mean anything here. Nothing. You don\u0027t mean anything here.\"\\n\\n He slapped the check against Marcus\u0027 chest, hard enough to shove him back toward the fence.\\n\\n He\u0027d overlooked it in his fury, or perhaps he didn\u0027t care, craving the fight and the violence, some outlet for everything churning inside of him. While cultured, elegant and beautiful, Marcus was also bloody strong, dangerous as a wolf and knew how to fight in ways far beyond Thomas\u0027 skills. He was deadly when crossed, and he was a sexual Dominant.\\n\\n Not to be confused with an alpha male, though he was that. Thomas had been naive, unaware of all those terms until he got direct experience in what they meant and what things it unlocked in himself.\\n\\n Marcus\u0027 hand clamped down on his wrist, holding it to his chest. Catching Thomas by the back of the neck, he stepped forward aggressively. Riding on anger, Thomas was unbalanced and so Marcus was able to thrust him against the section of the barn wall that formed a corner with the fence.\\n\\n Marcus immobilized his legs by thrusting one of his own between them, holding the hard pressure of his thigh against the base of Thomas\u0027 testicles, his forward weight making it uncomfortable. The slam against the barn wall also knocked the wind out of him, pissing him off further. He could beat Marcus in a fair fight, but nothing about this was fair, not with his head so fucked up, caught off guard by Marcus\u0027 presence in his world, a world Marcus had never been a part of. Could never be a part of.\\n\\n \"Settle down,\" Marcus said shortly. A short brusque command he emphasized with the pressure of his leg, the squeeze of his hand on his nape. \"Settle,\" he repeated, and Thomas realized his clenched hands were gripping Marcus\u0027 shirt just above his waist under the coat. Ostensibly it was to thrust him away, straight-arm him, but Thomas found his hands were squeezed into tight fists, holding onto him as desperately as he was trying to push him away.\\n\\n When Marcus shifted against that needy ache in his groin, Thomas did something he\u0027d not done since he was thirteen years old. Without warning or plan, not even a frantic moment to try to stop it, he came, his cock spurting hard inside his jeans. His hips jerked, grinding him against the muscular steel of Marcus\u0027 thigh beneath the pressed slacks even as he wished for the grip of his hand, those clever fingers.\\n\\n As if he knew Thomas\u0027 mind as well as his cock, Marcus slid his hand in between them, cupped him, took him through it, a desperate, over-too-quickly orgasm cut short by Thomas\u0027 own shame and fear of being seen. But they were screened by the barn wall, so for one minute his mind shoved that away and allowed him to savor the feel of Marcus\u0027 possessive touch on his cock, his intimate knowledge of it that helped him find the head unerringly and rub the ridge.\\n\\n Marcus stroked his knuckles up Thomas\u0027 turgid length, then down to the balls to hold them in a firm grip, squeezing.\\n\\n \"Oh God.\" Thomas shut his eyes. One of his hands had now moved to Marcus\u0027 shoulder, clutching it, seeking to steady himself because the ground was no longer stable.\\n\\n \"All right, then?\" Marcus\u0027 voice. The anger remained, but there was something ragged and tender beneath it. He had his hand on Thomas\u0027 nape still, only now he was stroking him. \"You didn\u0027t ask permission to come, but I think under the circumstances I\u0027m flattered enough to overlook it.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t be here. You can\u0027t do this to me.\"\\n\\n \"It appears I did, regardless.\" Still, Marcus drew back, considered him as Thomas looked away over the field, trying to catch his breath, find a balance. Marcus didn\u0027t let him go, though. Nor did Thomas release his grip.\\n\\n \"I did buy one of your pieces. Just one. The one with the cow.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody else wanted it. Like you said, right?\" Because Marcus was always right. It didn\u0027t change anything, though. Being right didn\u0027t make things right. He wondered if Marcus had ever understood that in his whole life.\\n\\n \"No. I auctioned it as I promised. For ten thousand dollars.\" It took Thomas\u0027 brain a moment to register it. When he did, his face went rigid with shock.\\n\\n \"I had to bid against seven other serious bidders. It created quite a bit of excitement, as well as the accusation that I was driving up the price for my gallery. Didn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n They fought me all the way for it.\"\\n\\n \"For ten thousand dollars.\" Thomas couldn\u0027t even get his mind around it. He was weak enough to wonder what it would have been like to be there, see people wanting his work enough to compete against each other for it.\\n\\n \"But...why that one?\"\\n\\n \"You know why.\"\\n\\n He did know.\\n\\n They\u0027d been in Marcus\u0027 bedroom, which Thomas had started to think of as \"theirs\", since he\u0027d practically moved in by then. He\u0027d been naked on his stomach in their bed and Marcus had been straddling his ass, working his hands down his shoulders, helping him work out one of the muscle kinks that came with a too-intense studio session.\\n\\n \"So...this cow picture? I might have an idea for you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just trying to sabotage the bet. Get me to paint something that wouldn\u0027t be picked up at a yard sale. Cows playing Mahjong.\"\\n\\n \"That would be picked up at a yard sale.\" Marcus chuckled, his hands kneading, fingers tracing curves of muscles in ways that had Thomas aware of his every shift against his buttocks, the press of Marcus\u0027 thighs on either side of his hips, holding him down.\\n\\n \"I see you standing against a fence, farm boy. Leaning there like you\u0027ve just finished a day of plowing. You\u0027re sweaty, streaked with dirt and you\u0027ve taken off your shirt.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Thomas grinned, but he let out a moan of sheer ecstasy as Marcus hit the kink in his shoulder. \"Right there.\"\\n\\n Marcus obliged. \"You\u0027re wearing those working jeans that have no style, but they\u0027re riding low on your hips. Because you\u0027re leaning against the fence, they\u0027re straining over that fine ass you\u0027ve got.\" His fingers trailed there, but he\u0027d told Thomas not to move, so he didn\u0027t, though his balls drew up tight and hard from his Master\u0027s provocative touch. \"Maybe a cowboy hat dangling from your hand.\"\\n\\n \"Bill cap,\" Thomas said automatically.\\n\\n \"Excuse me?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a baseball cap. We don\u0027t wear cowboy hats.\"\\n\\n \"All right, then. The sun\u0027s setting behind your precious cow and sunlight is just barely touching you, outlining your body. I can see the hint of sweat on your shoulders.\" He smoothed his hands over them. When his fingers grazed Thomas\u0027 jaw, they paused to caress his lips. Thomas closed his eyes.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just a farm boy taking a break after a hard day, never realizing how breathtaking he is in that one perfect moment. Everything about him is in that picture.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so full of shit.\" Suddenly uncomfortable, Thomas flipped and attempted to heave Marcus off him. Instead, he found himself pinned full length under his Master\u0027s aroused body. He\u0027d struggled, but when Marcus fisted his hands in his hair and kissed him hard, his tongue sweeping inside to claim his mind, that was that.\\n\\n It had lingered with his muse, though, so he\u0027d created the painting. He\u0027d never done a self portrait and was glad to do it from the back. He did a photo session to get some perspective on points of himself he\u0027d never seen, which included some close-ups he\u0027d had to forcibly wrest from Marcus to destroy.\\n\\n In the end, he\u0027d found it oddly difficult to paint himself, trying to put together the pieces from photographs. The final effect gave the painting a brilliant starkness, almost as if the artist had painted the figure from inside to out, starting with the skeleton and forming muscle layers over which the skin was painted. The figure of the man was an absorbing contrast to the easy beauty in the green of the meadow, the vibrant colors of the sun.\\n\\n \"I kept that farm scene, because your soul is in it. You\u0027re living up to your responsibilities.\" Marcus nodded toward the hardware store. \"But you\u0027re looking toward that sunset, all the colors, the miracle of it, yearning for it.\\n\\n \"It was one of your best pieces. It was you. I wanted it.\" Marcus\u0027 tone lightened, but Thomas heard the edge beneath it. \"As you said, I get what I want.\" Marcus leaned against the fence. There was just the space of one man between him and Thomas now. When Marcus put his foot up on the bottom slat, Thomas couldn\u0027t see if he was as turgid and aching as Thomas had been only moments before. And would be again in no time if Marcus didn\u0027t remove his chiseled face, sensual lips and lean strong body from Thomas\u0027 senses soon.\\n\\n \"I have a proposal for you. One that I hope you\u0027ll consider. It would allow you to be here and nurture your talent both. Are you ready to listen, or do you need further attention?\" He flicked his glance over Thomas, letting his gaze slide down like the lazy path of hot oill on heated skin.\\n\\n Oh yeah, in no time at all. \"Just tell me.\"\\n\\n Marcus inclined his head. \"Artists come to New York to make it because that\u0027s where you can get hip deep in the industry, make connections. You\u0027ve done that. My gallery is in the center of things and the reaction at that auction says I can market your work without you. J. Martin is one of my biggest clients and he doesn\u0027t make public appearances at all. If you never want to cross the Mason Dixon line again, you don\u0027t have to. You provide the art, I\u0027ll sell it, get it distributed, build your name.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want in return?\"\\n\\n Silence was a weighted thing, and Thomas felt it in Marcus\u0027 gaze. Suddenly, beneath it, he felt so out of place. Everywhere. He didn\u0027t belong here, but it was where he was needed, had to be. He didn\u0027t belong in Marcus\u0027 New York world anymore either, but when he\u0027d been with Marcus, he\u0027d felt like he belonged anywhere. Wherever Marcus was.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t be thinking like this. He started to fumble open the work apron and spread it over his damp groin. Marcus spoke.\\n\\n \"One of the buyers was Hans Joyner, a hotel mogul who\u0027s salivating to see more.\\n\\n He\u0027d like to put about fifty original pieces in his exclusive male salons across Europe.\\n\\n No restrictions on the subject matter. Fifteen thousand each upon delivery. Take out my sixty percent and you\u0027re still bringing in six thousand dollars per completed work, in addition to what else you\u0027ll start selling when your name starts growing.\"\\n\\n As Thomas hesitated, Marcus sighed. \"Thomas, you\u0027re working short-staffed at a hardware store that, while admittedly a tribute to a bygone age, only makes enough to break even. Barely. You run in the red half the time. You still have debts from your father\u0027s funeral and Rory\u0027s astronomical medical bills, not to mention that expensive medical college your sister\u0027s scholarship won\u0027t cover beyond the first year. If one of the big home improvement stores goes up in a nearer town in the next few years, it will end you and you know it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no right to dig into my business.\"\\n\\n \"No right.\" Abruptly, the civilized veneer was gone. Thomas was blasted with the unexpected heat. Marcus pivoted and shoved him back into the same corner, slamming his palm against the side of the barn so Thomas was caged between Marcus\u0027 arm and the fence. Violence and desire always rode the same horse when it came to his feelings about Marcus. Despite a desire to shove back, Thomas abruptly wanted the taste of that mouth again, the feel of those hands gripping him so roughly. Gripping him any way Marcus desired.\\n\\n The green eyes flickered with the knowledge. With fire.\\n\\n \"Do you want to kiss me, pet?\" Marcus asked huskily. \"Do you think I don\u0027t know just my voice can make you hard? You were hiding that stiff cock of yours behind the counter from your sister, because your body remembers everything about responding to my voice, my touch, the whisper of a command. Did you cream yourself when I grabbed your wrist?\"\\n\\n His hand dropped to cup Thomas\u0027 balls again, his thumb rubbing slowly along the ridged head of his cock. Marcus swore softly as Thomas groaned, clenching his teeth.\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t stop him, but Thomas grabbed the edge of the fence in one hand, holding it so his knuckles whitened, so he wouldn\u0027t be weak and seize Marcus again.\\n\\n \"What you want is for me to bend you over this fence and fuck you hard, fill you where you\u0027ve been empty for far too long.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t...been.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure. There\u0027s a wealth of eligible playmates for you down here.\" Marcus\u0027 gaze shifted briefly over the open field. He leaned even closer, his lips a hairsbreadth away, his breath caressing Thomas\u0027 face. God, Thomas wanted that tongue, needed it pushing into his mouth the way he wanted Marcus\u0027 cock pushing into his ass. \"But that\u0027s not the reason I know that. You\u0027re mine, Thomas. You\u0027ve been mine from the beginning. If you let any other man touch you, I\u0027d kill him.\"\\n\\n With that one statement, Marcus put it out there. Thomas had walked away, convinced himself it was over, whereas Marcus had never released the end of the leash.\\n\\n Perhaps that\u0027s why Thomas had never felt the chain had been broken. Because it hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n A hard shudder ran through him despite himself. Marcus\u0027 eyes grew more intent, more brilliant. Perhaps his mother was right. A serpent in the desert. Marcus\u0027 complexity, his gentleness, his urban polish, his humor, all of it was underscored by a generosity that was limitless. He even at times had a loving, nurturing nature.\\n\\n But all of that was twined like a serpent\u0027s coils with this, a ferocious darkness, a Dominant\u0027s need to possess and control that Thomas had not realized he would match with an equal submissive hunger. From the beginning he\u0027d wanted to belong to Marcus and only Marcus, in ways a boy from rural North Carolina wouldn\u0027t have imagined existed inside himself.\\n\\n \"No!\" He shoved Marcus away from him and backed into the open space of the parking area where he could breathe, though the world was teetering dangerously as if it wanted him to slide right back into Marcus\u0027 grip. \"Don\u0027t fuck with my head. You don\u0027t need to pull that crap just to get me to make more money for you.\" While he said it only to hurt, he needed the defense. Besides which, in his heart he knew it was true. Not the part about Marcus using him for money. Even before he walked away, Thomas had always known Marcus would tire of him in time, no matter how intimate they\u0027d gotten. These were Thomas\u0027 roots and he needed those roots. He had to live up to them, because they were permanent and real. Unlike Marcus\u0027 attraction to him, which he knew was only permanent and real in his most fantastical dreams.\\n\\n Marcus\u0027 face transformed into a mask of indifferent politeness, which told Thomas he\u0027d hit the mark with enough accuracy to make his heart hurt. \"I knew you were gutless when you walked away from me. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d resort to being that stupid redneck kid again as well.\"\\n\\n Thomas\u0027 spine snapped straight, his chin jutting out like his brother\u0027s. \"Now you\u0027re trying to start a fight.\"\\n\\n \"If it makes you remember the will to have one, gladly.\" Marcus nodded once.\\n\\n Coldly.\\n\\n \"This is who I am. Where I\u0027m staying.\"\\n\\n \"Is it what you want?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t always get to be about what you want,\" Thomas said between clenched teeth. \"Life sometimes is making the best of what you\u0027re given.\" Marcus considered him. The breeze moved his hair on his shoulders, a strand brushing his firmly held lips. \"Fine, then. Ignore your feelings about me, bury them. Try to destroy them by throwing asinine insults at me, but do the work, send it to me. I\u0027ll sell them at the contracted price, send you the money and it will supplement your income to keep your family going.\\n\\n \"If nothing else, I\u0027m still the gallery owner who has the connections to get your work noticed, Thomas. Your talent is phenomenal. You\u0027ve only scratched the surface of it. No matter what you think about me, people don\u0027t spend thousands of dollars on a piece of artwork from someone whose name they don\u0027t even know, unless the talent is so remarkable they don\u0027t care whether it\u0027s a brand name or not.\"\\n\\n \"Stop.\" Thomas shook his head. \"You know I can\u0027t handle that kind of shit. I can\u0027t...I haven\u0027t thought about...\"\\n\\n As Marcus\u0027 eyes narrowed, Thomas felt the gnawing teeth start up on his gut, as vicious as the blades of the chipper.\\n\\n For months, the ideas had been elusive, formless, ruthlessly kicked into a hole in his subconscious like a swamp filled with sucking mud.\\n\\n Because of that, he couldn\u0027t allow himself to accept what Marcus was saying.\\n\\n Couldn\u0027t even enjoy the vision for a moment, though a greedy part of him wanted to bask in the idea of achieving success as an artist. Instead, Thomas almost felt sick. When he moved his hand to knead his stomach, he forced himself to stop as Marcus\u0027 sharp attention went to it.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t Marcus\u0027 fault. He knew that. He\u0027d always known that. It just wasn\u0027t meant to be. Thomas took a deep breath, let it flow out of him, let the anger go. \"You know your business, you always have. When you say things like that...it scares the hell out of me. It also...there\u0027s a part of me that\u0027s just fucking amazed by it.\" A light smile crossed Marcus\u0027 face, but didn\u0027t reach his eyes. \"You deserve to let all of you be amazed by it. Not just a part.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not there anymore.\" Thomas forced the words past stiff lips. \"I need the money, but I wouldn\u0027t know where to start. Everything\u0027s insecticide, feed, and \u0027what size couplings do you need for your plumbing\u0027?\" He gave a half laugh at Marcus\u0027 raised brow.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t want you to explain what a coupling is to me.\" Thomas shook his head, reached out a hand. It felt as if it weighed three times what Kate did. \"Thanks for dropping off the check. I\u0027m sorry for how I acted. You...you didn\u0027t do anything. It was all me. I took it out on you. You just surprised me, is all.\\n\\n Wasn\u0027t ready to see you here.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t exactly fit in this painting, do I?\" Marcus looked around, still not taking the hand, though Thomas kept it out stubbornly.\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n When Marcus clasped it at last, Thomas tried not to show how the contact rippled through him, ached in his bones as if he\u0027d been gripped by the flu. Already the sandwich he\u0027d packed to have at noontime was something he knew he wouldn\u0027t be eating.\\n\\n \"Give me a week.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been here eighteen months, working six or seven days a week with no time off, no breathing room at all. I think they can cover for you a week, particularly if it means they can add a significant source of income to the annual budget. I\u0027ve got a friend\u0027s place up in the Berkshires for a month.\" Still holding Thomas\u0027 hand, Marcus reached inside his coat with a free hand and drew out an airline ticket. \"The date\u0027s transferable. I\u0027ll be there for the next thirty days, working out of the house and visiting some of my gallery contacts and artists in that area. Come spend the week in the house, bring your sketchbook. I promise you beautiful scenery, wonderful eccentric communities and quiet spots of nature.\" His eyes gleamed. \"A wide variety of things to resurrect your muse.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be there.\"\\n\\n Marcus nodded. \"I\u0027ll be there.\"\\n\\n \"Marcus, I can\u0027t... I can\u0027t promise you anything.\" That wasn\u0027t what he\u0027d intended to say. No, I can\u0027t start this again. I can\u0027t be with you even a week. A day.\\n\\n But Thomas didn\u0027t say that. Everyone knew an addict couldn\u0027t have just one drink, one fix. But no matter how strong Marcus\u0027 hold over him, they both knew the building behind Thomas, the people waiting in it and all that meant would always call him back.\\n\\n The question was whether it was worth it to him to give himself a week of Marcus again, now that he knew how intolerably hard it was to walk away from him, be without him. Knowing he\u0027d have to sever that link and do it to himself all over again at the end of the week.\\n\\n But Marcus and his art together...even if Thomas had to let Marcus go again, if he rediscovered his art, he could have that. Maybe that would help fill the aching void enough that it wouldn\u0027t be as difficult this time.\\n\\n And maybe Thomas wanted Marcus so much he just didn\u0027t give a damn how hard it was going to be to walk away again.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"No. I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Marcus nodded. \"Hold onto the ticket. It\u0027s yours to use or not to use.\" Thomas held it out. He couldn\u0027t afford the temptation. \"No. You take it back. Give it...\" The words \"to someone else\" hung on his tongue as if he were pierced by a fish hook whose barbed tip he couldn\u0027t dislodge.\\n\\n He\u0027d tortured himself with images of other hands on Marcus\u0027 body, other men seeing that thick cock, Marcus thrusting into them. He woke from dreams about it, wanting to smash and tear something. He usually settled for going out in the middle of the night in nothing but his pajama bottoms to chop wood, the pain singing through every muscle, his fingers knotting with the agony of clenching the axe too hard.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t, Marcus. I just can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Marcus turned for his car. Didn\u0027t take the ticket. Thomas clutched it with the check Marcus had picked up, smoothed and handed back to him. He swallowed. Goddamn it.\\n\\n \"Marcus, are you - \" He bit it off, knowing it was wrong to show how he felt. As powerful as the physical attraction was between them, it was even more dangerous to give Marcus the edge of knowing how much deeper it went for Thomas still. In fact, if he was forced to look at himself in a mirror and be brutally honest, Thomas knew he hadn\u0027t realized how much he loved Marcus Stanton until he left him. He was pathetic.\\n\\n Marcus turned at the driver\u0027s side door. He\u0027d put his sunglasses back on, distancing himself, and Thomas felt exactly like what he was, an awkward, gangling kid dealing with a man who was one step ahead of him on everything. Swiss watch, self confidence and a strong sense of his identity.\\n\\n \"What, pet?\"\\n\\n The endearment was uttered in a neutral tone Thomas knew could hide anything from hurt to scornful amusement.\\n\\n \"Are you...are you being careful? I\u0027m not...fishing. I don\u0027t have any right to be, to ask anything. And I\u0027m not,\" he added quickly. He just knew Marcus. Knew that there was a reckless side to his personality, odd moments of melancholy that had once been known to compel him to go out for an evening\u0027s entertainment wherever he could find it, not giving a damn about protection. It was a side of Marcus few knew about, and he\u0027d only picked up on it from bits and pieces of things Marcus had revealed about himself, most of them inadvertently.\\n\\n Thomas had been able to balance Marcus\u0027 dark side, calm it, where friends who\u0027d known him longer couldn\u0027t even touch it. When Thomas had asked Marcus about that, to determine if he was imagining it or not, Marcus had been sitting on the balcony staring out in the night, seeing shadows Thomas didn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because you\u0027re an artist, Thomas. I don\u0027t mean a person who paints or sculpts, though that\u0027s one form your perception takes. You see into the souls of others more easily. It should make me want to close all doors against you, because my soul is the last thing I want anyone to see. But - \"\\n\\n \"But...\" Thomas had prodded. But Marcus had said nothing else, his green eyes lost in the darkness.\\n\\n \"I just want to know you\u0027re taking care of yourself,\" Thomas said, coming back to the present. \"You matter.\"\\n\\n Marcus left the driver\u0027s side, came back across the gravel in his Italian shoes.\\n\\n Thomas held his ground as Marcus picked up his hand and ran his fingers over the tip of the injured one. \"Same goes, pet.\" Though the shades concealed Marcus\u0027 eyes, Thomas felt the intensity of his focus. \"Come to the Berkshires. The address is written on the back of the ticket. Don\u0027t say no. Just think about it and be willing to give it a try.

As difficult as it was to give up his lifelong dream, it\u0027s nothing next to walking away from the man he loves. Marcus taught him to embrace who he is, a sexual submissive who responds to the touch of only one Master. But why would the sophisticated Marcus need some farm kid from the South? \\n Then Marcus shows up and offers him a way to continue his art career and help his family. There\u0027s only one hitch-he asks Thomas to spend a week with him in the Berkshires. Thomas knows he should refuse.
