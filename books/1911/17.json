{"id":87903,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"After dropping that major bomb, Marcus withdrew almost politely from Thomas\u0027 ass. He asked where he could clean up, which he proceeded to do at the utility sink, using paper towels and soap. As he gestured to Thomas to take his place, he refused to answer any questions, simply told Thomas he\u0027d meet him in the car. Thomas saw his sister at the door of the store as he crossed to the parking lot. When he opened his mouth, she nodded, waved him on. \"We\u0027re quiet right now. Just come back for the post-lunch rush.\" \"I told your sister I would have you back in an hour, assuming you get a lunch break.\" Marcus was standing beside the rental car. \"She told me to take as long as we need.\" When Thomas got in, Marcus pulled out of the gravel parking lot, gunned the engine to pull ahead of a slow moving pickup truck. Mr. Gardelli, coming to get more fertilizer, Thomas assumed. Who\u0027d probably be eyeing the fast car and muttering about Yankee invasion. \"I like your sister,\" Marcus commented. \"She wants to ditch the next semester to stay home and help. Says I shouldn\u0027t be carrying it all.\" \"She\u0027s right, but not about the college part. You set her straight.\" \"I did, but she\u0027s got a stubborn streak.\" \"Thank God she\u0027s the only one in the family. It can be a pain when they\u0027re all infested with it.\" Thomas sent him a narrow glance, but Marcus said nothing further, just gave him a bland smile. The Hill farm was five miles down from the hardware store, set back a half mile from the road. It was a rambling old farmhouse, built in the 1940s, in need of work, sitting on ten acres. Mr. Hill had died last year and Mrs. Hill was comfortably ensconced in an assisted living facility. It hadn\u0027t been an actual farm for ten years, but the Hills had had some small plots for a roadside produce stand to supplement their social security. There was a barn with a loft, a storage building, as well as a well-laid-out yard that Mrs. Hill had once kept cultivated with flower gardens. A swing hung from the old live oak in the front yard, which also had the remains of a tree house from when the kids were younger. \"Have you been inside before?\" Marcus asked as they got out of the car. \"Yeah. We grew up with a couple of the kids. Mrs. Hill baked a lot. We stole a pie from her window once and she chased us all about five miles up the road with a spoon.\" Laughing all the way, Thomas remembered. He remembered he\u0027d hung back to get the brunt of it because Rory hadn\u0027t hit his growth spurt and was too young to outrun her, shorter legs and arms pumping. He\u0027d been shouting joyously, still too young to know what the word bitter meant. Marcus was on the porch, had unlocked the door and was letting it stand open. He turned. Gestured to the barn. \"Lot of space there. It has a loft. The whole thing would make a great studio.\" Yeah. It would. Thomas was gripped between anticipation and apprehension. He didn\u0027t want to think it, hope it, because he knew it wouldn\u0027t work. \"Marcus, what are you doing?\" Marcus studied him in that intent way again. \"Just what I said I was doing. Reclaiming my property.\" He tilted his head toward the door, then stepped in, disappearing. Thomas swore softly, went up the stairs and followed him. He\u0027d always liked the big wraparound porch. Sitting on the bottom step, spitting watermelon seeds at Johnny and May Hill, keeping an eye on Les as his Mom and Mrs. Hill shared cake and talked. There was no furniture in the big kitchen except for a dusty oak table that had been left there. The paper on the walls was harvest gold seventies floral and stripes, but the smell of old wood preserved by quality care and brought out at this particular time of day by the sun was soothing. There was a quiet to the house, as it waited to become a home again. Perhaps to the two men regarding each other across the room. \"We could restore this together.\" Marcus put it out there. \"Mix of old and new, traditional with our own tastes.\" \"Marcus, you live in a penthouse.\" Marcus shrugged, settled back against the counter, crossing his arms, watching Thomas with those brilliant green eyes. A dragon\u0027s eyes. \"I live anywhere I want to live. I can maintain a residence here and in New York. There\u0027s a small airstrip nearby that can handle private planes. I can fly back and forth as needed to the gallery. Both of us could go there whenever we want to. I have an excellent general manager. She\u0027d be delighted to take on more responsibility.\" \"You don\u0027t belong here. You don\u0027t fit. You\u0027d hate it after a week. Local theater consists of the high school\u0027s biannual production of Gershwin, or Rodgers and Hammerstein. No gourmet shops.\" \"There\u0027s only one question relevant for you to answer. Do I belong with you?\" Thomas swallowed, looked away. \"That\u0027s not the issue.\" \"I just made it the issue. Do you belong to me, Thomas?\" A pause, a quick jerk of his head. He couldn\u0027t deny it, had said it before. Marcus\u0027 eyes flared, quick and hot, but still he didn\u0027t move. The room seemed to be getting smaller. \"Then, next question, same question. Do I belong with you?\" \"That\u0027s not for me to say. I can\u0027t - \" \"If it\u0027s not for you to say, then it\u0027s for me to say. Why the hell are you so afraid to take this for yourself? I say I do belong with you. To you.\" Marcus\u0027 eyes traveled around the kitchen. \"There\u0027s a good fresh market right up the road,\" he mentioned, changing the direction of the conversation, putting Thomas off balance. \"The sign caught my eye. Strawberries, flowers and boiled peanuts. Ordinary things, put on a sign like the most amazing treasures. Reassuring, basic. I picked up some excellent tomatoes and green peppers from a woman wearing a purple and red hat that any pimp on the strip would envy.\" Thomas choked on a snort. \"That\u0027s Mrs. Dorsey.\" \"She gave me a recipe for a seven layer salad that calls for enough mayonnaise to give me arterial blockage. When I told her I\u0027d bought this place, she said if I needed help making the salad for entertaining my friends, her divorced daughters - one or both of them - would be happy to help.\" His eyes managed to glint with amusement without losing a watt of that immobilizing intensity. Something in Thomas was responding despite himself, like a bird waiting at the door of a cage that was inching open. \"At which point,\" Marcus continued, \"her mother - who, by the way, looks like she sailed over on the Mayflower - elbowed her and said in a stage whisper, \u0027Betsy, he\u0027s far too good-looking. You know he\u0027s got to be one of those homos\u0027. Elongated o\u0027s, by the way.\" Thomas\u0027 lips twitched. \"I bet Betsy Dorsey just about passed out.\" \"She was quite mortified. I took Mrs. Mayflower\u0027s hand, kissed it and said she had senses as sharp as a vampire\u0027s teeth. And I\u0027d appreciate that help if the offer was still open, because I figured she was the one who taught her daughter how to make the salad to begin with.\" Thomas pushed off the door, ran a finger through the thick dust on the table. \"We\u0027re not backward here, Marcus. As long as you don\u0027t shove your differences in people\u0027s faces, they\u0027re pretty tolerant.\" \"Did I sound shocked?\" Marcus asked mildly, raising a brow. \"We had a good chuckle over it and Mrs. Dorsey talked me into some fresh squash. I know the problem isn\u0027t the community, Thomas. It\u0027s your history in it. Your family. What will Mrs. Dorsey say when Thomas Wilder shows up with that handsome Yankee everyone knows is gay? But it\u0027s not even about that, because small town people are usually a lot sharper than us big city folk believe. Most of them probably guessed it about you long ago.\" He shifted, tilted his head. \"Your mother, your family, is a serious obstacle. But what I\u0027ve realized is that you\u0027re the true problem. What you feel you deserve, the faith you have in us. The question isn\u0027t do I belong in this world of yours, but do you want me to belong in it? I\u0027m willing to try, because your mother is right about one thing. You need this part of your life. It\u0027s as much a part of who you are as your painting. And...maybe I need it too, because it\u0027s the core of you.\" Thomas\u0027 gaze snapped up. Marcus turned then, as if he suddenly had a need to move, had gone somewhere he\u0027d not necessarily intended to go. Looking out the window, his expression became more thoughtful, his gaze drifting. \"At the hospital,\" he said at last, quietly, \"you said that if it wasn\u0027t for your responsibility to your family, you\u0027d stay with me until I kicked you out. Are they your safety net, your mother, Rory and Les?\" \"What?\" Thomas\u0027 brow furrowed. \"If you believed I would never tire of you, never kick you out, would the answer be the same?\" Thomas shuffled, drew a circle in the dust. \"As hard as it is to be without you now, I don\u0027t think I could handle watching you get bored with me.\" \"And you think I would?\" Thomas couldn\u0027t answer. Though he thought he saw a flash of pain in Marcus\u0027 expression, his voice was still even when he spoke next. \"How would you feel if you knew I had every intention of making what we had a forever deal? That I consider you mine, not just now or a year from now, but every year after that?\" \"Scared shitless.\" Thomas managed a smile he didn\u0027t feel. Marcus nodded. \"I can see a lot of things here, Thomas. I can see us in this kitchen, making dinner for your family. Your mother might be tight-lipped at first, but then we\u0027d all loosen her up. She\u0027d be giving ideas on curtains before she left. I imagine you on that front swing, your feet bare, toes brushing the ground as you sketch that way you do, like everything else has disappeared. I see a tester bed, a firm mattress, able to take punishment. Like you.\" Marcus turned now, his lips curving, voice settling into a lower, enchanting cadence. \"I see you leaning against the doorway over there. I can imagine moving past you, stopping just a breath away from your mouth, pressing you back into the frame with the weight of my body. I\u0027d be on the phone, brokering deals hundreds of miles away, and yet my hand would be on your cock, sliding around to your hip to cup your ass, watching your eyes go opaque and dangerous like they are now. \"Bending you over the kitchen table, or pushing you to your knees to suck my cock while watching the sun set over the fields, anticipating taking you up to my bed, fucking you and holding you while you sleep... I can imagine you and us a million ways here, Thomas. I will make my home where you are, because you are my home. I don\u0027t know any way to say it any more clearly. So now the ball\u0027s in your court.\" Marcus straightened, faced him squarely. \"I want you to move into this house. Make a home with me.\" As Thomas stared at him, speechless, Marcus came across the room. \"And another thing. I\u0027ve had enough of this shit.\" He laid a hand on Thomas\u0027 shoulder, then another on his abdomen, curving over the ache, making Thomas wince. \"It ends here. You need someone at your back, making sure you\u0027re taking care of yourself, someone who\u0027s able to truly kick your ass back into line when you don\u0027t. And in the words of the country song, slightly altered, I\u0027m wearing the outrageously expensive Italian loafers that can do it.\" It was unreal. Like a Twilight Zone episode, only in vibrant color and without the eerie echoing hopeless ending suggesting that human nature would always disappoint. Thomas didn\u0027t know what to answer, couldn\u0027t think what to say. Then Marcus\u0027 cell rang. Marcus glanced at it. His eyes darkened, his lips thinning. \"I\u0027ll be outside. Look around.\" As Thomas watched Marcus leave out the kitchen door, step onto the porch, he felt that brief sense of hope drain away. He looked around the kitchen. Marcus wanted him to make the ultimate step, and yet in this fateful moment, he was demonstrating he wasn\u0027t willing to make Thomas fully a part of his life. Perhaps the Twilight Zone episodes were on target, just like Thomas\u0027 original feelings. Even if Marcus did think his feelings for Thomas were love, they wouldn\u0027t last. A passing phase, having to do with not being willing to hear the word no. Marcus\u0027 subconscious apparently knew it even if he didn\u0027t, because he continued to feel the need to keep his secrets. As he had the thought, Thomas realized that wasn\u0027t fair, exactly. Once again they were at the point of \"I\u0027ll show you my hand if you show me yours.\" Whatever was in Marcus\u0027 past was apparently his most closely guarded secret. Until Thomas was willing to surrender to him completely, he wasn\u0027t going to trust. Was that how it worked? A slave\u0027s full surrender could win a Master\u0027s trust? Or was it like gradually loosening a tight box lid, taking it up a little on either side, not able to get too far ahead of the other side until it all came up at once? Maybe it was different for every two people. He stepped out as Marcus snapped the phone closed, exchanged a look with him. Marcus opened his mouth. \"Don\u0027t,\" Thomas said quietly. \"Don\u0027t lie to me about who that was. If you don\u0027t want to tell me, just don\u0027t tell me. You\u0027ve...\" He turned and looked at the house. \"This is a dream, Marcus. I think it\u0027s a dream I want, maybe the dream I\u0027ve always wanted, but I\u0027m not sure of what you want, or even who you are. You always keep it to just you and me, and a person is about a lot more than that. They are what they come from, who their family is, where their deepest secrets and fears lie. \"You know all those things about me,\" Thomas said. \"I\u0027ve never hidden them from you - when I tried, you just ferreted them out. But in order to live in a house like this, you\u0027ve got to appreciate the light. An artist needs light like air. To flourish and create. To believe in the art.\" When Marcus didn\u0027t respond, Thomas turned to face him again. Marcus looked at a loss for words. Not being reticent, not muddling through something insightful to take the wind out of Thomas\u0027 sails later. It was like he didn\u0027t know how the hell to respond. Marcus was ageless in his looks, but in that second Thomas almost saw evidence of his mortality in the rigidity of his facial muscles. He stepped forward, the weighty topic thrust aside. \"Marcus, you okay? What\u0027s wrong?\" Marcus started as if caught doing something wrong, shook his head. Turned away quickly before Thomas could touch him. \"I told your sister I\u0027d have you back. Let\u0027s go.\" \"Marcus - \" \"Don\u0027t.\" The word snapped out like a whip, and Thomas froze in the act of reaching toward him. Marcus had never rebuffed him. He\u0027d intended to take Marcus\u0027 arm, stop him, and the way Marcus recoiled from him, his eyes green and hard, clearly did not invite contact. \"Get in the car or walk.\" Thomas set his teeth and inclined his head. \"Fine.\" He should feel anger and a sense of justification in his mistrust of Marcus\u0027 offer to play house. But as Marcus turned away, Thomas watched him closely, the stiff body posture, and all that didn\u0027t seem to matter. Marcus, the epitome of dangerous grace, narrowly avoided running into the side mirror before he found the door handle and got back in. When they got back to the store parking lot, he parked and got out of the car before Thomas could say anything. Alarmed by the way Marcus shoved open the door of the store, Thomas lunged out of the car and quickly followed him in. Les and his mother were at the cash register. Rory was on the nail aisle, restocking. His mother paled at the sight of Marcus, but curled her fingers into resolute balls on the counter, even as Les put a reassuring hand on her arm and cast a worried glance at Thomas. Thomas increased his step and managed to almost catch up before Marcus reached them. He\u0027d taken his organizer from the car and now unzipped it on the counter, inches away from his mother\u0027s knuckles. \"Pen,\" he said to Les, in a voice so calm and precise Thomas thought it could chisel rock. Les mutely handed him the pen and he began to write. \"Celeste says you\u0027re buying the Hill farm.\" Elaine raised her chin. Marcus didn\u0027t even glance at her. \"It\u0027s already bought. In cash, closing statement signed and deed recorded. I know enough about small towns to know that family connections can muck with a building inspector\u0027s report.\" \"You can\u0027t buy us,\" Elaine said, her voice quivering. \"You can\u0027t buy my son.\" \"An intriguing thought, and a pity. I think he\u0027d be far happier as my slave than he is as yours.\" Marcus kept writing. \"Thomas, this is your part on the dozen pieces you\u0027ve done. The courier will arrive later today to pick them up. It\u0027s a good agency so you don\u0027t need to worry about them getting to me safely.\" While he shifted his attention to Thomas, Thomas had the strange feeling Marcus was somehow seeing them all, including him, through some type of distorted filter. He\u0027d done that once as an experiment, painted an image through a wavering piece of glass. For a little while it had seemed as if he was somehow seeing an alternative but perhaps more true reality of what he was painting. In the same way now, Marcus seemed conscious of all of them, but in a way that felt skewed, raw. \"You\u0027ll redo the last one as we discussed or I\u0027ll take the extra advance out of your hide.\" His green eyes focused somewhat, a seductive promise briefly in his voice. Thomas didn\u0027t dare look at his mother or sister, alarmed at the tone even as he couldn\u0027t help but respond to it. \"I want that painting.\" Abruptly, Marcus turned and slammed his hand down on the counter, making both women jump. He leaned in, his eyes snapping, face inches from Elaine\u0027s frozen features. \"I haven\u0027t bought him. I have the goddamned privilege of handling his work. Have you looked beyond your own nose at what those paintings are? They\u0027re art. Art is that which touches us down to the soul, tells us this is what life\u0027s about. People come into my fucking gallery and stand in front of his fucking work for twenty minutes, because even if they can\u0027t put their finger on it, they know they\u0027re standing before something so priceless this measly amount,\" he waved the check, \"doesn\u0027t touch its value. \"Accepting what people are, what they can\u0027t change and loving them with every part of yourself anyway. That\u0027s what love is about.\" He glared at Elaine. \"You take that away from him, you make him believe that kind of love doesn\u0027t exist... It would be better for you to shoot him rather than destroy him inch by inch, year after year. If you do that, you\u0027re not saving his soul, you\u0027re killing it. If you\u0027d look into his eyes for once, you\u0027ll see it. How we love is our soul.\" Out of his pocket he yanked the rag that Thomas had left on the sink in the shed and foolishly not thrown away. Marcus tossed it on the counter in front of her. \"That brown stain covering about half of that cloth isn\u0027t paint. It\u0027s coming from your son\u0027s stomach lining. I want him to see a doctor this week. If he won\u0027t go, you hogtie him and make him do it.\" He looked toward Thomas. \"Or I\u0027ll come back and do it for you.\" \"Marcus, cut it out. Mom, that\u0027s not - \" Marcus made a slicing gesture with his hand, relocked gazes with Elaine. \"If you still actually know what being a mother instead of a missionary is about, you\u0027ll get him there and figure out why he\u0027s doing it before he kills himself. He\u0027ll do anything to take care of you. Of all of you.\" He sent a hard glance toward Rory. \"Get a clue.\" As Elaine lowered her gaze to stare at the rag, her fingers reaching out to touch it, Marcus tore off the check, left it on the counter and turned toward Thomas. \"I\u0027m headed back to New York. But I\u0027ll be back, and we\u0027ll pick up our conversation then.\" Folding the organizer up, he pivoted and headed toward the door as brusquely as he\u0027d come in. Various questions were churning inside of Thomas, but seeing Marcus about to walk away brought one of them up immediately. \"When?\" The word was out before Thomas could think to stop it, or completely mask the urgent need for an answer. Marcus turned at the door. There was such a powerful emotion in his eyes that Thomas almost moved forward, his lover\u0027s fuck-off routine be damned. He saw something in Marcus\u0027 eyes that told him he\u0027d needed to hear that tone of want in Thomas\u0027 voice, in front of his family. Marcus had needed it so desperately that it looked in danger of shattering something within him completely. The last word Thomas had ever thought to describe Marcus was lonely, but it was in his face now. \"Whenever you ask me to come, pet,\" he said softly. \"Just not today. No matter what happens, I can tell you this. I will always love you. No matter what you feel you need to be, where you need to go, I\u0027ll always know you\u0027re mine. I understand that now. So you can at least be easy on that, all right? It\u0027s okay. I love you.\" His attention shifted back to Elaine and something altered in his expression, became much colder. She raised her gaze under the compelling power of his stare. \"If you ever touch anything he creates again, you won\u0027t have this place, your house. You\u0027ll be lucky to get a bed in a state nursing home when I\u0027m done with you.\" \"Marcus - \" \"No, Thomas.\" His mother surprised him by speaking. \"Let him say what he\u0027s going to say. \"This is your dream, your husband\u0027s. Even Rory\u0027s. Not his. He loves you. That\u0027s why he\u0027s here and part of what makes me love him, frustrating though it is to love a fucking noble idiot. But don\u0027t give me the slightest opportunity to take it away from you, the way you\u0027re trying to take it away from him, because I will. His art is his soul. You attack his soul again like that and I don\u0027t care who the fuck you are to him. Clear?\" She stared back at him, making no acknowledgement, though her shoulders quivered with the effort of holding the pose under that intimidating glare. It was the most cowed Thomas had ever seen her. Marcus nodded as if he\u0027d gotten the answer he expected, turned on his heel and left the store. Thomas ignored his brother\u0027s demand for an explanation, his sister\u0027s murmured reassurance to their mother and went after him, spell broken. When Thomas caught up with Marcus at the car, he grabbed his arm, bringing him to a halt. \"What the hell was that? What is wrong with you?\" Thomas was angry at him, but he was more furious with his inability to figure out what the tumultuous current of murky waters under the surface of the whole scene was about. He wanted answers. Marcus ran a hand over his face, the back of his neck. When he raised his head to meet Thomas\u0027 gaze, it was as if the act took great effort. \"I thought...if you couldn\u0027t leave, I could bring it here, give you a way...\" He shook his head, moved away from Thomas\u0027 touch and got into the car. The window was down, but what was swirling around Marcus, the fact he\u0027d removed himself from Thomas\u0027 touch twice now, didn\u0027t encourage Thomas to take immediate advantage of the opportunity the open window provided. Fitting the key into the ignition, Marcus held it there. Thomas felt a spear of apprehension as a shudder seemed to run through his arm. Marcus stiffened, his expression shutting down again as he turned over the ignition. \"You may be right. An artist needs light. And I bring my own darkness. Maybe we don\u0027t belong together, Thomas. I don\u0027t know. I really don\u0027t know anything right now.\" Reaching out the window, he put a key that was sitting on the dashboard in Thomas\u0027 hand. \"The house is in both of our names. Move in if you\u0027d like. Maybe I was just...maybe I\u0027m just fucking crazy.\" \"Marcus.\" Changing his mind, Thomas put his hand on the window ledge and leaned in, not caring who might be watching. Touching Marcus\u0027 face, he ran his knuckles along the slope of his rigid jaw. \"Stop,\" he said softly. \"Just stop, and slow down. Trust me. Will you ever trust me?\" Marcus closed his eyes, his lips pressing together, so Thomas moved his touch there, fingers tracing them. Something was terribly wrong, and none of the rest of it mattered. \"No,\" Marcus said at last, opening his eyes and looking directly at Thomas. \"I can\u0027t trust anyone. It\u0027s just not in me. Not now. Not ever. I\u0027ve got to go.\" He hit the window control then and Thomas had to pull back his hand or have it trapped. \"Marcus, dammit...\" But Marcus had already put the car in reverse in almost the same movement and backed it. Normally, he was a smooth, confident driver, but now he pushed down on the gas like a teenager learning how to work a clutch. Thomas had to move back fast to spare the toes of his fortunately chosen steel-toed work shoes. He didn\u0027t want to go back into the store. Everything in him was saying he needed to jump in the store\u0027s truck, run Marcus\u0027 ass down and figure out what the hell was going on. Marcus had never been like this. So dead, so final. An hour ago, he\u0027d been threatening to set up house just down the road. Despite Thomas\u0027 doubts, he\u0027d gotten him hoping, considering. Wondering if it was as impossible as it sounded. Now Marcus acted like...he didn\u0027t know where they were now. Thomas tried to ignore the feeling that Marcus had just started the beginning of the end between them. Over a fricking phone call. He went back into the store, steeling himself. Something in his face must have warned them, for even Rory said nothing, back to making a quiet clinking sound on the nail aisle. Or perhaps they were both waiting for their mother to detonate. To break down. Instead, she was looking at Thomas\u0027 face. \"Are you okay, son?\" she asked softly. He swallowed. \"Yeah. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027s okay at all. And he won\u0027t tell me why.\" She pressed her lips together then jumped as the ledger book she\u0027d opened on the counter began to twitch and make a buzzing sound. \"What on earth - \" Les flipped up the ledger book to find a cell phone there. On the third vibration, the ring tone kicked in and Rory\u0027s brow creased. \"Is that...\" \"Highway to Hell. Marcus is a closet AC/DC fan.\" Thomas said absently, then shook his head at Rory as he snickered. \"No cracks about closets.\" Moving to the counter, he picked up the cell. It was an extension of Marcus\u0027 arm. For him to be upset enough to forget it made Thomas question the wisdom of allowing him to get behind the wheel of a car. \"Mom, what\u0027s the area code for Uncle Ren in Des Moines?\" \"515.\" Thomas stared at the phone. Iowa. Marcus was getting a phone call from Iowa, and a quick press on the call listing button told him it was the same number his last call had come from. \"Thomas,\" his mother said. \"What are you doing?\" \"Getting some answers.\" He flipped it open. \"Hello?\" The line was crackling with static, so he had to repeat it. \"Marcus...is John. Have a crappy connection out here. You there?\" \"Yeah.\" Thomas waited, straining his ears to hear through the crackling. When Les started to speak to their mother, he shook his head, made a sharp hand gesture for quiet and hoped no customers came in. \"This...\" there was a pause on the other end. \"This isn\u0027t Marcus, is it?\" \"No. This is his partner.\" Thomas managed not to hitch over it, though in his mind there was a significant pause in thought, trying to decide the best word to use. It left it open to meaning business, or more than that. Apparently, either one seemed to ease John\u0027s concerns enough, though he added the question. \"So you know what\u0027s going on?\" \"Yes. Marcus left for a few minutes. Is there something else you need?\" \"Is he...okay?\" On that, Thomas was on solid ground, and was able to give the key sense of intimate knowledge that apparently would win John\u0027s trust and assumption that he did in fact know what the hell was going on. \"No. He\u0027s definitely not okay.\" \"Jesus.\" John blew out a sigh. \"Then maybe you can think of a way to say this to him. I talked to Mom. She says she\u0027s going to respect Dad\u0027s last wishes. She doesn\u0027t...hell, no good way to say it. She doesn\u0027t want him at the funeral. I mean, she does, but Dad didn\u0027t and she\u0027s just... \"We\u0027re going to need another transfer on the burial expenses. His last days were pretty rough, so I tapped out the account for the hospital. He\u0027s got to understand, it tore her apart these last days. All she can think about is how much she loved him and misses him, so of course she\u0027s going to support his wishes right now. \"Marcus will want to transfer another six thousand in there Friday. That\u0027s when I\u0027ll need to pay the funeral home. She\u0027s worried to death about the farm, but I told her Sue and I can cover everything. Didn\u0027t think it was time to lay on her that Marcus has been paying their way out of every tight corner for the past ten years. \"Maybe...after this all dies down, he could come home for a visit. I think she really wants to see him. Hell, we all do. He\u0027s probably told you how she is, all the Bible stuff about Dad being the head of the household and obeying him. Hell, if I tried to get Suzie to go that way, she\u0027d hit me in the head with a two-by-four. It\u0027s just the way they are. \"He was a mean old bastard. Stubborn, but Marcus is like that too. Stubborn, mean when crossed. They never saw how alike they were, even as different as we know Marcus is. I...I didn\u0027t mean that in an offensive way, okay? I mean...I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re his partner...or his partner. Or both. Ah, hell. Don\u0027t know why I\u0027m telling you all this. It just...it\u0027s been a hell of a day. Will you just tell Marcus we love him and when this crap is past, he should come home? He really should. I know he won\u0027t, but...will you tell him?\" \"I will.\" When Thomas heard John hang up, he closed the phone and started to slide it in the front pocket of his jeans. Iowa. Marcus had a family in Iowa. A farm. A father who\u0027d just died. But he was also Dodger, somehow connected to Toby. On a hunch, he scrolled through the call history, the phone list, and found Owen\u0027s name. One part of him knew this was wrong, but the larger part didn\u0027t care. Pieces were missing, but the pieces that were coming together were goading him into the territory Marcus had always declared off limits. Well, to hell with that. As Thomas cued up the number, finger poised to start the call, he glanced at Les. \"I\u0027m going to New York for a few days. I need you to make sure the courier gets those pieces. Okay?\" She nodded, her eyes full of questions even as she glanced toward Elaine. \"Marcus\u0027 father died,\" Thomas added. \"Oh.\" Les made a little sound as her mother crossed herself, then folded her hands on the counter. \"Maybe he left the phone here deliberately, Thomas, knowing...\" \"Mom, enough.\" Thomas said coldly, stopping his mother mid-sentence. \"This isn\u0027t a debate. While I\u0027m gone, ask the Brewster kid to come in. He could use the money anyhow.\" He turned to Rory, who\u0027d rolled up close to the side of the counter near his mother, attempting to make a wall of their disapproval. Thomas cocked his brow at him. \"While I\u0027m gone, you\u0027re in charge of the store.\" A surprised expression fluttered across his mother\u0027s face. \"Thomas, Rory can\u0027t - \" \"I can\u0027t - \" \"Yes, you can. More than that, you will.\" Thomas stabbed a finger at him, his brows drawing down. \"You chickenshit out and let Mom take over, as she\u0027ll try to do to baby you and your wallowing self-pity, I will yank you out of that chair and put a foot up your ass. Your legs don\u0027t work, but your brain does, your arms and upper body does, and you can use Les and Brewster\u0027s kid when you need a pair of legs. I need a good manager to handle things this week. You\u0027re that guy.\" He gave his brother an even, take-no-shit look. \"You can hold more figures in your head than a rocket scientist. So stop focusing on what you don\u0027t have and use what you got. Or I\u0027ll tell Amanda Brewster you\u0027re really a paraplegic and your dick doesn\u0027t work.\" \"She already knows it does,\" Rory snapped and then colored to his roots. His mother and sister turned, a look of consternation on one face, barely suppressed laughter on the other. \"Well, if you\u0027ve got the brains to use it, you can do other things.\" Despite the circumstances, Thomas felt a gut-loosening grin cross his face. Then his mother\u0027s expression shifted back to him. As he met her gaze head-on, he felt a calmness that was new to him. \"When I get back, we\u0027ll talk. I may be gone several days. You know how to get hold of me.\" For once, without further comment, she nodded. He wasn\u0027t unaware of how she had her hands folded together, her short nails biting into her skin, but he would deal with that. He\u0027d been dealing with things for eighteen months, but hadn\u0027t felt in control of anything. For the first time since his father died, that feeling was gone. He was going to New York. To Marcus.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rough-canvas-nature-of-desire-6/page-17.html","bookId":1911,"book":{"id":1911,"title":"Rough Canvas (Nature of Desire #6)","description":"Storyline: Rough Canvas (Nature of Desire #6) When his father dies, Thomas is forced to abandon a burgeoning art career in New York. As difficult as it was to give up his lifelong dream, it\u0027s nothing next to walking away from the man he loves. Marcus taught him to embrace who he is, a sexual submissive who responds to the touch of only one Master. But why would the sophisticated Marcus need some farm kid from the South? Then Marcus shows up and offers him a way to continue his art career and help his family. There\u0027s only one hitch-he asks Thomas to spend a week with him in the Berkshires.
