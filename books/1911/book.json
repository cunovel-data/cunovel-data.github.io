As difficult as it was to give up his lifelong dream, it\u0027s nothing next to walking away from the man he loves. Marcus taught him to embrace who he is, a sexual submissive who responds to the touch of only one Master. But why would the sophisticated Marcus need some farm kid from the South? \\n Then Marcus shows up and offers him a way to continue his art career and help his family. There\u0027s only one hitch-he asks Thomas to spend a week with him in the Berkshires. Thomas knows he should refuse. But he\u0027s never been able to say no to his Master.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/rough-canvas-nature-of-desire-6.jpg","author":"Joey W.
