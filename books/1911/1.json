{"id":87887,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"When the shop bells over the store entrance rang, Thomas didn\u0027t pay much attention. He was in the back tagging a wood chipper for repair and Celeste was out front to handle visitors. But when he heard the customer speak to his sister, he raised his head. Everything in him went tight, alert.\\n\\n It was a male voice, the words as unintelligible as her response, but something about that voice stirred something in his lower belly. Goddamn it, there was no way it could be... The sprawling wooden farmhouse and barn which his father had turned into a hardware store supplying this part of rural North Carolina area was hell and gone from New York City. There was no way that voice could belong to who he thought it did.\\n\\n Thomas drew in a steadying breath, taking in the pleasing smell of old wood. The building had been designed to feel like the farm stores of a hundred years ago. He\u0027d always loved that about it, the quiet, powerful aura of permanence, stability. It blended with the landscape and served as a landmark of a time long past. It had become somewhat of a tourist attraction, so they had a petting area fenced off beside the barn as well as a large paddock and grazing field with a pony, goats, chickens and a pack of pigs that roamed and rooted.\\n\\n There was even one gentle-eyed ancient cow Thomas\u0027 father had rescued from a slaughterhouse. An ironic compulsion for a man who regularly sat down to beef stew, but he\u0027d seen the calf bawling for her mother, who\u0027d already gone up the chute. He\u0027d purchased the baby and brought her home to his six-year-old son as a gift. Though in his gruff way, the old man hadn\u0027t called the female calf that. \"She\u0027s your responsibility from here on, Thomas. You have to take care of her.\" A responsibility he\u0027d embraced. It hadn\u0027t caused a jagged ache in his gut the way the responsibility of being back here some twenty years later did, despite his attachment to the place.\\n\\n An ache that was being intensified by a voice Thomas knew too well. Damn it. It wasn\u0027t him. He hadn\u0027t slept well last night and he hadn\u0027t finished breakfast. He\u0027d just keep checking out the chipper, because it wasn\u0027t who he thought it was. If some Twilight Zone reality existed and it was him, it was better for Thomas to stay back here anyway.\\n\\n But Thomas sat there, his hand in the machine, resting on some broken but entirely forgotten mechanism as that far-too-similar voice coaxed things to life that he\u0027d buried six feet under his heart well over a year ago.\\n\\n A murmur in the dark, the touch of a hand passing over his hair as he drifted off to sleep. Waking to that same voice whispering to him, bringing him to life with clever fingers as he was filled deep and hard from behind.\\n\\n Come for your Master.\\n\\n His \"collar\" had been a slim gold waist chain he wore beneath his clothes. A relief, since he wasn\u0027t comfortable wearing jewelry that didn\u0027t fit the masculine stereotype, but then he\u0027d discovered discretion hadn\u0027t been the intent. The chain rode low on his hips, keeping him hyperaware of every shift of his ass. The three-inch double tail of excess chain beneath the joining point had a way of working its way around to brush his pubic area, keeping him semi-erect most of the time.\\n\\n When they lay in bed in the morning and he wasn\u0027t quite awake, his Master would slide the strands so they were at the small of his back, in order to tease the crease between his buttocks. He\u0027d move his long-fingered hand from Thomas\u0027 hip to fondle his morning erection.\\n\\n The fastener had been a locked disk with one printed word. Mine. Even the press of that metal piece against his skin, reminding him that he willingly belonged to another, kept him hard.\\n\\n Jesus, what was he doing? He yanked his hand from himself. He\u0027d been pressing the heel of it on the erection rising fast and hard under his jeans, giving himself some relief with the mild abrasion. He wished whoever the customer was would leave. That voice was too much like the voice he had to forget, would forget.\\n\\n Even as he thought it, he firmly pushed away the knowledge of how often he got himself to sleep by masturbating to that voice in his head, the remembrance of his Master\u0027s hands taking him over, taking control, taking everything and giving back mind-shattering pleasure in return.\\n\\n When Celeste giggled, he froze. An austere, never-flustered and entirely too serious girl for her twenty-one years, Les did not giggle or titter. She might chuckle, perhaps occasionally laugh if he caught her in an unguarded moment, but the obsessive-compulsive premed student helping him out on her semester break did not giggle.\\n\\n Son of a bitch. As he started to straighten, he hit the switch to the chipper with his knee.\\n\\n He jerked back as the motor roared to life, experiencing a harrowing blink of resistance as the blades caught the tip of a finger. He yanked free, stumbling away. The machine snarled its fury. Or rather, the broken part was grinding like it was dying.\\n\\n Given the circumstances, the noise just seemed far more sentient and sinister.\\n\\n \"Son of a bitch, son of a bitch...\" It stung like hell, but that wasn\u0027t what made him shake from head to toe. My hand...\\n\\n \"These hands are the real works of art, pet.\" When his Master said that, they\u0027d been in Thomas\u0027 tiny warehouse room, which also served as his studio. He\u0027d guided his Master\u0027s hands into the paint and they\u0027d stood together at the canvas, hands overlaid. They created something that, while not great art, was as much an expression of life as a child\u0027s handprint in plaster.\\n\\n His Master\u0027s white silk shirt had been open, the lean muscular slope of the chest down to the sectioned stomach muscles exposed. He\u0027d removed the belt from his slacks so they\u0027d dropped lower, giving Thomas even more of the mouthwatering sculpted abs and diagonal musculature angling toward the groin. The shirt was loose so there was the hint of the points of his broad shoulders, the biceps disappearing into the sleeves.\\n\\n Thomas had pressed behind his Master, turned him toward the mirror so he could trace his stomach with paint-covered fingers, taking streaks of color up over the pectorals and hard nipples, all the way to the throat. His Master had even allowed Thomas to run his hands over the expensive shirt so he left streaks of color on his clothes as well as his skin. Then his hands had overlapped Thomas\u0027, mixing the colors, making a living tapestry that reflected Thomas\u0027 passion for all that was his life.\\n\\n All that was his life then. Not now. Not ever again. Cracking open an eye, he found he still had five fingers, though the tip of his forefinger was welling blood. A slice had been taken out of the meat and part of the nail was torn. It was more blood than damage. Cursing regardless, he picked up a rag and wrapped it around his finger, holding it to staunch the bleeding. He squeezed his eyes shut so he wouldn\u0027t scream out his rage.\\n\\n Earlier this morning his mother had suggested an improvement to the paint color area. \"Why don\u0027t you paint a display there, Thomas? Something that will make people see how certain colors work together for their bedrooms and trim. You\u0027re so good at that. You haven\u0027t been painting since you came home, and you used to love to do it so much.\"\\n\\n He thought he might get physically ill if he walked down the paint aisle today.\\n\\n Fuck it. Whoever the hell it was, he had to see. No way Marcus Aurelius Stanton was wandering around a hardware store in the middle of North Carolina. Surely he wasn\u0027t the only one in the world with a drop-your-pants-because-I\u0027m-going-to-fuck-you-now voice.\\n\\n Thomas strode out of the back room, maneuvered around the repair counter and nearly trampled Les, coming around the corner from the other side.\\n\\n \"Oof.\" She stopped herself with defensive hands against his chest. \"Clumsy oaf.\\n\\n What\u0027re you doing, charging out of there like a bat out of hell? I was just coming to find - \"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t hear her. Not after the first sentence, when his eyes found the customer standing in the aisle behind her about fifteen paces away, who turned from his contemplation of fixtures at the sound of her exclamation.\\n\\n Lucifer would have looked like that, Thomas was sure. Temptation, a hundred percent Grade A, tightly packaged in a hard-muscled six-foot frame. He knew what that frame looked like without a stitch on it. Marcus had a faint birthmark on the inside left thigh, but no tattoos or piercings. His lip had curled with disdain when Thomas teased him about it.\\n\\n \"Art is fixed on a canvas for a reason. If well preserved, it doesn\u0027t distort or fade. I don\u0027t believe time will be as kind to this canvas.\" He wasn\u0027t wrong about much, but Marcus was wrong about that. Thomas knew the man he was looking at would be riveting until the day he died, even with the sculpted lines of old age. But he didn\u0027t need tattoos or piercings. It would be like trying to touch up and improve Michelangelo\u0027s David.\\n\\n He wore his black hair loose on his shoulders. It was silk, the different lengths that fell over his brow and swept back from his aristocratic cheekbones only emphasizing his bone structure. He was the prince of every fairy tale that had ever been written. Not the prince who led the king\u0027s armies, but the one who handled his negotiations for peace with a rapier intelligence that was twice as deadly a weapon as any general could imagine. A king might gain capitulation through force of arms. Marcus could acquire surrender through nothing more than a look.\\n\\n Not only had Thomas touched those sensual, firm lips with his own, they had touched every part of his body. He remembered his arms and legs spread and bound as Marcus\u0027 mouth moved over his belly, his chest, nuzzling his throat briefly before he straddled Thomas\u0027 face and fed his thick, long cock between his eagerly waiting lips.\\n\\n His jaw had rubbed against the rough texture of Marcus\u0027 leg and the smoother skin of his inner thigh as he\u0027d sucked and licked and done everything to drive Marcus mad.\\n\\n When Marcus\u0027 grip on his hair fisted and the thighs hardened to drive himself deeper into his slave\u0027s throat, Thomas had felt triumph.\\n\\n How many lips had touched that impressive cock since Thomas\u0027? Probably more than he could count. Thomas hadn\u0027t been anything special. Lots of people knew how to give good head.\\n\\n He told himself cruel things like that and tried to paste them as words in Marcus\u0027 mouth to wean himself from the images that haunted him. He\u0027d been successful enough that they plagued him mostly at night now, or when he\u0027d worked a sixteen-hour day at the store and everyone else had gone home. Then it was just him and the silence of the old building, the sky dark outside and winking with stars that certainly couldn\u0027t be seen in the night sky over New York City.\\n\\n That long cock was contained in dark slacks probably custom-tailored by some impressive name like Armani. A blue T-shirt was tucked into it and Marcus wore a dark suit jacket over that. The Swiss timepiece on his wrist probably cost as much as their John Deere tractor inventory. Thomas knew Marcus would be wearing snug cotton boxer briefs in his preferred black. Glancing down, he saw Marcus wore Italian loafers.\\n\\n New York Upper East Side casual, which would be the equivalent of church clothes around here.\\n\\n \"Tommy, this man had some questions I didn\u0027t know how to answer.\" Les held up a small handful of clips. \"How much weight can these hold if you\u0027re using grade-two nylon line? I told him he might prefer the twine stock, but - \"\\n\\n \"Too rough,\" Marcus said, his green eyes focused on Thomas\u0027 face. \"I want something that won\u0027t scratch.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, like to protect a boat\u0027s gell coat.\" She nodded. \"How much weight did you say it needed to handle?\"\\n\\n Marcus\u0027 gaze dropped, passed down Thomas\u0027 torso and back up again. It only took a moment, just long enough that Celeste turned to him as he reached Thomas\u0027 flushed face again.\\n\\n \"About one sixty-two. Not that much, after all.\" Son of a bitch. Thomas had been one-ninety before he\u0027d come back here. How did Marcus do that?\\n\\n \"Oh my God, Thomas. What\u0027s happened to your hand?\" He\u0027d been holding the rag over his fingers, but sometime during Marcus\u0027 perusal he\u0027d put his palm on the repair check-in counter top and gripped the edge, hard. A fine stream of blood had dripped past the rag and down the side of the paneling.\\n\\n Celeste was two steps closer than Marcus, but somehow Marcus got there before her, grabbing hold of his wrist and tugging off the rag to see the bloody finger.\\n\\n He wanted to snatch back, snap at him, but the feel of those long fingers manacling his wrist, the fact he was now close enough he could smell him... Dry-cleaned clothing mixed with the scent of travel, that expensive aftershave and cologne he wore, just a light touch so it became part of the air around him... Thomas could identify him even with his eyes closed.\\n\\n The first time he\u0027d followed that scent it had been their initial night together.\\n\\n Marcus had taken him home. The sex had been... Thomas could say it was the most amazing sex of his life, but it had been more than a great fuck. He hadn\u0027t even known he wanted to do some of the things he\u0027d done that night until he found his cock responding to nothing more than Marcus\u0027 commands.\\n\\n Afterward, Marcus had given him the courtesy of his own room, but Thomas had been stirred up with all the new feelings, aching inside in a way that went beyond the physical. In the early hours of the morning, he\u0027d found himself following the lingering scent of Marcus to his room. The door had been open and he\u0027d gone in like a guilty thief.\\n\\n He\u0027d hesitated at the foot of the bed, knowing he hadn\u0027t been invited. So instead Thomas knelt on the carpet and laid his head on the mattress, his hand slipping ever-so lightly onto Marcus\u0027 calf where it extended out of the folds of covers.\\n\\n About five minutes later, Marcus sat up, propping himself on his elbows. He\u0027d reached out and touched his hair. Thomas knew then he hadn\u0027t been asleep. He\u0027d been watching him, waiting to see what he\u0027d do.\\n\\n Marcus had opened the covers, drawn him in and spooned around him, his hand giving Thomas\u0027 ass a proprietary squeeze that was a demand. Thomas had adjusted his leg and Marcus slid his now-hard cock into his still well-greased ass. As Thomas groaned at the feel of it, Marcus had pressed his lips to his ear and whispered that he would sleep that way. Thomas would just have to suffer with no release until the morning.\\n\\n The hard yearning ache he hadn\u0027t wanted to end that first night surged up in him now at Marcus\u0027 touch, so alarmingly intense he tried to pull away. Marcus, anticipating him, planted his feet. They eyed one another like gladiators.\\n\\n \"Stop struggling. You splatter my shirt and I\u0027ll kick your ass.\"\\n\\n \"You could try,\" Thomas retorted. Under normal circumstances, Marcus\u0027 eyes would have glinted with humor and lust stirred by the challenge, but as he looked at Thomas\u0027 hand there was nothing amused in his expression. And these were definitely not normal circumstances.\\n\\n \"You still have the shop bells,\" Marcus observed. A casual comment as Celeste came back with the first aid kit, but Thomas knew there was nothing casual about it.\\n\\n Thomas had given them to his father one Christmas. His dad had looked a little perplexed, but once the customers started appreciating them, his traditionalist of a father found he liked that alert system more than the fancy but banal electronic buzzer most stores used.\\n\\n The memory of when he got the bells swamped him like another blow to the gut, propelled by Marcus\u0027 intent, knowing expression.\\n\\n Thomas had seen the bells in the window of an antique store in the Cape Cod village they were visiting. He\u0027d ducked in, flipping Marcus off when he made a comment about gay men\u0027s obsession with antiques. Thomas got absorbed in the store, picking out some small prints of Cape Cod scenes done in pen and ink. A music box for his sister. He looked over some pieces of old farm equipment, knowing that when he went home for Christmas he\u0027d describe to his dad how they were put together.\\n\\n He wished he could take Marcus with him. Even if that was a possibility, he knew he wouldn\u0027t dare ask Marcus. He\u0027d think Thomas was a lovesick idiot.\\n\\n Knowing he was an idiot, he even found and bought something he thought Marcus would like.\\n\\n Outside the store there was a sprung occasional chair, a relic from the nineteen twenties obviously beyond salability, too worn to be anything but a place for patiently waiting husbands. That significance wasn\u0027t lost on Thomas as he came out and found Marcus sitting in it, his head propped on the headrest as he caught a cat nap in the sun.\\n\\n He had an ankle balanced on his opposite knee, his slacks perfectly adjusted, one hand lying loosely on his knee, the other stretched along the chair arm.\\n\\n He still wore his sunglasses, emphasizing the relaxed curve of his mouth, the slope of his cheekbones. Thomas suspected the female foot traffic along the sidewalk in front of the store had increased exponentially since Marcus had taken the seat. Thomas managed to scare off a covey of them lingering as he stepped out.\\n\\n He heard their titters, their murmurs. \"Figures. He\u0027s too gorgeous not to be gay.\" He dropped to a squat by the chair. After a brief hesitation, he linked fingers with Marcus\u0027, for once trying not to care that they were on a public street. Marcus was much more relaxed about it, but then he hadn\u0027t grown up as Thomas had. Marcus had made his peace with his sexual orientation at fourteen. Even at seventeen, Thomas had been trying to bury any suspicion by being on every sports team he could find and taking girls to the prom, in order to give his mother photographs to share with relatives and linger over fondly.\\n\\n Marcus opened his eyes behind the sunglasses and lifted his head, his sleepy glance going from their linked hands to Thomas\u0027 face in a way that made Thomas think of every illicit thing they\u0027d done in the course of the weekend. It made him glad he\u0027d dared to touch Marcus this way.\\n\\n Get a grip. \"Check these out.\" He showed Marcus the bells, explained the use for them and their history for shopkeepers as Marcus straightened, touched them and experimented with the sound. \"So you think he\u0027ll like them?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he will.\" Marcus squeezed his hand, conveying with the simple gesture his awareness of Thomas\u0027 rocky relationship with his father.\\n\\n \"I got you something too.\" Thomas said it casually, even now wondering if he should have done it at all. Marcus had suits that cost as much as Thomas\u0027 entire wardrobe, starting with his first baby shoe until the present day.\\n\\n \"Yeah? Do I need to search you for it?\"\\n\\n When Marcus made a grab for him, Thomas fended him off with a grin and a forearm.\\n\\n \"Cut it out. Here.\" The gift had its own container, a pewter incense house that he now pulled carefully from the protective cardboard box. \"You can burn tobacco leaves in it to drive off that flowery shit you wear.\"\\n\\n That Thomas loved.\\n\\n \"Redneck Neanderthal. I\u0027ll just spray your deodorant around the apartment. Eau de\\n\\n \u0027I-am-not-gay\u0027, aka sweaty sock and pig wallow smell.\" But Marcus tempered the too-close-to-home barb with a hand to Thomas\u0027 jaw. As Thomas looked down and opened the pewter box, Marcus\u0027 hand drifted to his hair, his nape.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t help it, he started to tense. Touching hands was one thing. This Cape Cod village was more open, but it wasn\u0027t New York City. If Marcus should try to kiss him here, on a busy street...\\n\\n He\u0027d tried to mask it, but his Master was too intuitive. Marcus dropped his touch, a brief flash of disappointment on his face before it was gone, replaced by polite interest in what Thomas was offering, making him feel like crap.\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" he mumbled. \"I\u0027ll just show you at home.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Marcus reached out, closed his hand over the incense container. \"You\u0027ll show me now.\" He lifted the hinged triangular top, blinked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s stupid, nothing you have to wear.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, pet,\" Marcus said mildly, and the caress in the words, underlined by the gentle reproof, left Thomas silent with a whorl of confusing emotions in his lower abdomen.\\n\\n Marcus lifted out the dragon tie pin and matching cufflinks. The craftsmanship was exceptional on the antique pieces. They were no bigger than a fingernail and had chips of jade for the eyes, the tiny scales individually sculpted by the long-dead artisan. But his art had lived on. No artist could hope for more than that, to know that when his bones were dust, two people would sit on a street corner and admire what he\u0027d done.\\n\\n \"You remind me of a dragon. Your eyes.\" Your heat. Your intensity.\\n\\n \"Sitting on a hoard of treasure?\"\\n\\n That made Thomas smile, the tension in his chest easing. \"That\u0027s why I brave the flame.\"\\n\\n \"No. No, it\u0027s not.\" Marcus leaned forward then, caught Thomas\u0027 lips before he could draw back. He kissed him hard and thoroughly, his hand gripping the back of Thomas\u0027 neck so he couldn\u0027t move. He was gasping when Marcus at last pulled back.\\n\\n Their faces were still close, Thomas\u0027 vision dominated by green eyes. \"That\u0027s not why at all.\"\\n\\n That day had come back to him with one casual comment, just as all of it came back with that one touch as Marcus held his wrist.\\n\\n Thomas had heard how your life could pass before your eyes when it was threatened. Apparently every memory of that life with someone else could do the same when your heart was threatened.\\n\\n Of course, it wasn\u0027t as if he didn\u0027t relive it all every day in his mind anyhow. He was reminded by everything he saw, every object, scent or element of nature he\u0027d experienced with Marcus. Air, sunlight, water.\\n\\n He\u0027d gotten better at closing memories out at work, which was why he tried to work all the time. It helped make the burning ache a sweet dull longing over which he could more easily shovel the earth of his daily life to keep what should be dead in its grave.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a nick,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It looks like you sliced off the top of your finger,\" Celeste observed, swabbing at it with alcohol. It stung, but he barely noticed. While to all appearances, Marcus was just holding his wrist as a courteous customer helping out, Thomas felt the strength in his grip. In Marcus\u0027 eyes he saw he\u0027d welcome the fight if Thomas chose to try to get loose.\\n\\n So he stood still, glad for the counter to press against, which separated at least by a corner Marcus\u0027 body from his involuntary reaction to him.\\n\\n The desire to struggle often had been part of their more intimate moments, Marcus having to prove he could overpower and Dominate Thomas as if he was also overpowering Thomas\u0027 worries about embracing this unexpected part of himself.\\n\\n Though Marcus scoffed at \"a part of\".\\n\\n It\u0027s all of you, pet. You want to be my slave. You get hard every time I order you to get on your knees, to give me your wrists so I can chain you to the bed...\\n\\n \"You two seem to know each other,\" Celeste commented, taping on a bandage. \"Is this one of your friends from New York?\"\\n\\n \"I handle Thomas\u0027 work,\" Marcus answered with a professional nonchalance that didn\u0027t match the look he kept locked on Thomas\u0027 face. He was covering every feature, and when he lingered on Thomas\u0027 lips, Thomas felt saliva gather in his mouth. He couldn\u0027t help it, he swallowed. Marcus\u0027 fingers tightened on his wrist infinitesimally.\\n\\n From the way Thomas\u0027 body reacted, it was as if Marcus had in fact slapped a manacle on him right there.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the serpent in the desert,\" a voice said acidly.\\n\\n The reaction was instinctive. Just like a high-school kid surprised with his hand up his girlfriend\u0027s shirt, Thomas jerked back at the first syllables from his mother\u0027s voice.\\n\\n He succeeded in freeing himself, though he also managed to tear loose the bandage Celeste had been molding over his finger. The guilty reaction of course made the situation more apparent to everyone, including Celeste. Her eyes widened, shifting between the two of them even as Marcus gave him an unreadable look.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Marcus turned, as calm and composed as Thomas was disturbed.\\n\\n His mother had been gardening, he saw. Wearing her neat jeans and smock printed with wildflowers, she carried her garden gloves in one hand with her dusty spade.\\n\\n While she colored her hair now to keep it ebony, her skin, tanned from her time outdoors, showed attractive lines around her blue eyes.\\n\\n The deep lines around the corners of her mouth were not as appealing, particularly since she didn\u0027t often smile since his father had died and Thomas\u0027 brother Rory ended up in a wheelchair from a tractor accident. An accident Thomas knew she felt wouldn\u0027t have happened if Thomas had been here. And of course she was right. Right or wrong, it wouldn\u0027t have happened.\\n\\n \"The last time I checked,\" Marcus responded, \"you weren\u0027t my mother. So I don\u0027t see that why I\u0027m here is any business of yours.\"\\n\\n \"Marcus.\" His face might be inscrutable, but Thomas knew the reaction simmering under the surface. For all his polish, Marcus became a mean son of a bitch when his temper was provoked. He could wound a person terminally with the clever cruelty of his tongue, and his mother was far too vulnerable a target.\\n\\n \"New York fag,\" Rory snarled. He\u0027d been just behind Thomas\u0027 mother, so he rolled forward now, jutting out his chin and pinning Marcus with a glare.\\n\\n Marcus swept him with a dismissive glance. \"But one who can walk. Would you prefer being a New York fag if you could walk again? Or punch someone in the face who told you to fuck off?\"\\n\\n Celeste drew in a horrified breath. No one talked to Rory like that. In fact, he\u0027d been pretty much coddled like a newborn since the accident. He was drowning in self-pity.\\n\\n As his brother and the de facto head of the family now, Thomas knew it was something he should be doing something about. But with the store and everything else, and his own pain...he just hadn\u0027t. Maybe Rory wasn\u0027t the only one with a self-pity problem.\\n\\n \"Marcus - \" Thomas warned as his mother stepped forward, her expression taut with anger. Her hand automatically landed in reassurance on Rory\u0027s stiff shoulder.\\n\\n \"Your mother asked what I was doing here. Fine.\" Marcus drew a check out of his coat, turned and handed it to Thomas. \"I thought I\u0027d personally deliver your earnings from the work you left with me.\"\\n\\n \"But we pulled my work...months ago.\"\\n\\n Before Thomas left New York, Marcus had decided to include him in an upcoming gallery showing with bigger names. While Thomas\u0027 credentials from art school and awards had been exceptional enough to make his presence in the show acceptable, he was an unknown. Therefore, he\u0027d worked his ass off on the handful of pieces, knowing Marcus was giving him the type of break most artists didn\u0027t get offered twice.\\n\\n His walking out after finishing only half of the promised work brought an end to that. Not to mention it was a credibility blow to Marcus as a gallery owner. Marcus had been in the business long enough to weather such things with a shrug, especially from a nonestablished artist, but Thomas was fairly sure Marcus had never had a lover do it.\\n\\n While Thomas had missed his chance at the show when his father had the heart attack, it was when Rory\u0027s accident brought him home again less than a month later he knew his career as an artist was over. He\u0027d come close, but it wasn\u0027t meant to be. He\u0027d known then he wouldn\u0027t be going back.\\n\\n \"Since you said you didn\u0027t care what was done with them, I decided to feature the pieces in a recent show I held, for deceased artists.\" The light trace of sarcasm would go undetected by his family. Not by Thomas. Even as Thomas\u0027 jaw tightened, Marcus continued. \"I set the prices at what I felt they were worth. I thought you might appreciate the extra income.\"\\n\\n Thomas still hadn\u0027t looked at the check, but then Celeste\u0027s hand was on his, tilting it. \"Oh my God, Thomas. Twenty-five... It\u0027s twenty-five thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n Pandemonium broke out. Rory pushed his chair forward, nearly running over Les\u0027toes while she continued to exclaim. \"Thomas, this is...oh my God. Your art...\" His mother stood there speechless, though he could tell a hundred thoughts were rocketing through her head like mortar fire, her body stiff as if having to withstand the barrage.\\n\\n But he couldn\u0027t help looking down at it himself, touching the ink. Five figures. Five fucking figures for work he had done.\\n\\n A gallery check. Marcus\u0027 logo. Marcus\u0027 signature. Thomas\u0027 lips tightened, anger filling his mind with heat.\\n\\n Give him the damn check in front of his family. Like a gift from God.\\n\\n Pulling the check away from Celeste and Rory, he strode through the store, hearing the shop bells chime as Marcus exited the building ahead of him. His mother called after Thomas, her voice stammering as she tried to Marshall her defenses, but he was already past the defensive line. His own fury could carry him through this. He would handle it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rough-canvas-nature-of-desire-6/page-1.html","bookId":1911,"book":{"id":1911,"title":"Rough Canvas (Nature of Desire #6)","description":"Storyline: Rough Canvas (Nature of Desire #6) \\n When his father dies, Thomas is forced to abandon a burgeoning art career in New York. As difficult as it was to give up his lifelong dream, it\u0027s nothing next to walking away from the man he loves. Marcus taught him to embrace who he is, a sexual submissive who responds to the touch of only one Master. But why would the sophisticated Marcus need some farm kid from the South? \\n Then Marcus shows up and offers him a way to continue his art career and help his family. There\u0027s only one hitch-he asks Thomas to spend a week with him in the Berkshires. Thomas knows he should refuse. But he\u0027s never been able to say no to his Master.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/rough-canvas-nature-of-desire-6.jpg","author":"Joey W.
