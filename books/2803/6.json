In fact, I think it is in very poor taste, as Uncle Drac would say. It did not take me long to realize that ball-and-chain ghosts do not scream, \"DRAT THIS BOILER!\" In fact, I don\u0027t think that ball-and-chain ghosts are even a little bit interested in boilers. \"DRAT THIS BOILER! I HATE THIS GRATE!\" I could hear Aunt Tabby yelling through the wall of the secret passage as clearly as if I was standing next to her. I was glad I wasn\u0027t standing next to her, as I could also hear her kicking the coal scuttle and throwing the shovel at the wall. But time was running out. Soon a whole bunch of people who liked haunted houses would be walking around my house, deciding that they were going to live there instead of me. And if I was not careful, I would be stuck in a secret passage and not able to do a thing about it. I decided I had to give up on the balcony idea and go back and plan a Slimebucket Surprise. It was better than nothing. Since Aunt Tabby had given me a really big fright, I wanted to give her one back before I went. I looked for a chink in the wall to shine my flashlight through so that she would think there was a ghost in the boiler room--and that was when I saw him. I saw a ghost. He was sitting in a dark corner a bit far- ther down the secret passage. At first I was so surprised that I thought he was just an ordi- nary boy, so I said, \"Hey! What are you doing here?\" But when he looked up at me, there was something about his face that made me shiver, and I knew he must be a ghost. He had watery, ghostly eyes, and his face was kind of transparent and glowed with a pale light. I thought he was probably a ghost from long ago, as he had a funny bowl hair- cut and wore a tunic with a long hood. He had a dagger tucked into his belt too, which I thought looked pretty good-- Aunt Tabby won\u0027t let me have a dagger, however much I ask her. In fact, I felt as though I had seen him some- where before, as he looked just like the pic- tures of medieval pages in my knight-time storybook. I was pleased that he wasn\u0027t a nasty ball- and-chain ghost. I went up to him and asked, just to make sure, \"Are you a real ghost?\" He didn\u0027t answer--in fact he looked scared, like he had seen a ghost. It was a bit disappointing, really, as that was kind of backward. I was meant to be scared of him. \"So what\u0027s your name?\" I asked. He still didn\u0027t answer, which I thought was rude. Aunt Tabby would have told him it was rude too. He looked away and stared at the floor, and I could tell he was hoping that I would just go away. But there was no way I was going to walk away from the very first ghost I had ever found, especially after I\u0027d been looking for one for such a long time. \"You must have a name, \" I told him. I had expected a ghost to be more fun than this one was turning out to be. But then I heard some- thing that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. A weird, hollow whisper filled up the air all around me. \"Edmund . . . \" the whisper said. It was him--the ghost boy--talking. And it was spooky. Edmund floated up from the floor and drifted over toward me. I took a step back, as I suddenly wasn\u0027t so sure that I wanted to talk to a ghost after all. And then Edmund said something really odd--he said, \"Are you the Tabitha?\" He spoke with a strange accent that reminded me of some French people who had once turned up at the house, thinking it was a guesthouse. They hadn\u0027t stayed long. \"No, \" I told him, \"I\u0027m the . . . I\u0027m Araminta. \" \"Good, \" said Edmund, and he sort of walked up the wall and began to wander upside down along the ceiling. \"I do not like the Tabitha, \" he said in his funny accent. \"The Tabitha is noisy. \" He had a point, I thought. There were times when I didn\u0027t like the Tabitha either, and the Tabitha was most definitely noisy. In fact, just as Edmund was saying that, I could hear Aunt Tabby angrily shoveling coal into the boiler and banging the door closed with a loud clang. I figured Edmund must have heard a lot of Aunt Tabby\u0027s tantrums over the years. Then, just as I was beginning to like Edmund, he said, \"You must go now. \" \"What?\" I asked him. \"You must go. You may not come any closer. \" \"Why?\" He didn\u0027t answer. He just floated up and down in front of me with his arms out- stretched, as if he could stop me from going past him. He need not have bothered, as there was no way I was going to walk through a ghost. Brrr. No way at all. \"Well, I don\u0027t want to go any farther, so there, \" I told him. \"I only came to look for the way to the balcony. \" \"The balcony is not down here, \" said Edmund, who had begun slowly spinning around for some weird reason--don\u0027t ask me why. \"So you must leave. Farewell. \" It sounded to me as though Edmund knew where the balcony was, so I asked him if he would take me there. \"If I take you to the balcony, will you go away?\" he asked. I don\u0027t hang around where I\u0027m not wanted. I have better things to do. \"Well, I don\u0027t want to stay down here, do I?\" I told him. \"Don\u0027t you?\" said Edmund. \"Oh good. Follow me. \" So I followed him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-haunted-house-araminta-spook-1/page-6.html","bookId":2803,"book":{"id":2803,"title":"My Haunted House (Araminta Spook #1)","description":"Storyline: My Haunted House (Araminta Spook #1) Araminta Spookie lives in a wonderful old haunted house, but her crabby aunt Tabby wants to move.
