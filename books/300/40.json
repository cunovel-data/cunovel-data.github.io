{"id":16857,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XL. CONCLUSION.","content":"Rupert was walking down Broadway some two months later when he came unexpectedly upon Julian Lorimer. Julian was swinging a light cane, and wore a \"stunning\" necktie. He glanced superciliously at Rupert, and was about to pass without recognition, but curiosity overcame pride, and he called out, \"Halloo, Rollins!\" \"Halloo, Lorimer!\" answered Rupert. Julian frowned slightly. It was all very well for him to say \"Rollins,\" but he expected Rupert to say \"Mr. Lorimer.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen you for some time,\" he said. \"Are you still a bell-boy?\" \"No.\" \"Got sacked, eh?\" \"I sacked myself.\" [Pg 357] \"What are you doing, then?\" \"Going to a commercial school.\" Julian looked surprised. \"Who pays your expenses if you are earning nothing?\" \"I pay my own bills, thank you.\" \"It\u0027s very foolish for you to give up work. You will spend all your money, and what will you do then?\" \"Perhaps apply to your father for a situation,\" said Rupert, smiling. \"I don\u0027t think he needs any cash-boys at present. \"Are you working?\" \"Yes, I am with Ward \u0026 Weston, Wall Street brokers.\" \"I hope you like it.\" \"I do. When I am twenty-one pop will buy me a seat on the brokers\u0027 board, and I will go in for myself.\" \"I wish you success, Julian.\" \"You are very kind,\" said Julian, ironically. \"I guess there\u0027s no doubt of that. We have a great many influential friends. I go into the best society,\" he added, pompously. [Pg 358] \"You must enjoy it.\" \"I do. A week from this evening I am to attend a party at the house of Albert Fraser. His father is a rich merchant in the China trade.\" Rupert\u0027s face lighted up with amusement. Albert Fraser was his most intimate friend, being a student at the same commercial college, and he, too, had received an invitation to the party. \"Julian will be astonished to see me there,\" he thought. \"Is Albert Fraser a nice fellow?\" he asked, demurely. \"First class.\" \"I wish you would introduce me to him, Julian.\" \"You!\" said Julian, contemptuously. \"Didn\u0027t you hear me say that his father was a wealthy merchant?\" \"Yes.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t feel at liberty to introduce you,\" said Julian, haughtily. \"Why not?\" \"Because there is a great difference between a boy in his position and one in yours.\" [Pg 359] \"I don\u0027t see why.\" \"Aren\u0027t you an ex-bell-boy?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s enough.\" \"For all that, I think Albert Fraser and I will some time be friends.\" \"You are foolish. Bell-boys and bootblacks don\u0027t associate with gentlemen\u0027s sons.\" \"Yet I associate with you, Julian.\" \"I look upon you as an humble acquaintance.\" \"Then I suppose I ought to feel complimented by your condescending to notice me.\" \"I think I must leave you, as I have an engagement.\" \"Very well. I will meet you at Albert Fraser\u0027s party.\" \"I suppose that is meant for a joke. It isn\u0027t a very good one.\" When the evening of the party came, Julian got himself up regardless of expense. He had never before attended a party on Madison Avenue, and he was particular about his appearance. [Pg 360] Entering the house, he was directed to the gentlemen\u0027s dressing-room. What was his surprise—it might almost be called dismay—to find Rupert Rollins arranging his toilet before the mirror. \"Good evening, Julian!\" said Rupert, half turning. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded Julian abruptly. \"Getting ready to go down stairs. Shall I wait for you?\" \"But what calls you to this house, any way?\" \"An invitation! Didn\u0027t I tell you that I would meet you here this evening?\" \"Do you mean to tell me that you know Albert Fraser?\" \"Certainly. Shall I wait for you?\" \"No.\" Rupert smiled and went down stairs by himself. He was talking with Albert Fraser when Julian entered. The latter half drew back when he saw the two boys together. He had tried to persuade himself that Rupert was an unauthorized intruder. [Pg 361] \"Good evening,\" he said with a ceremonious bow. \"Good evening,\" responded Albert. Rupert bowed slightly, smiling as he did so. \"Ha! are you two acquainted?\" \"Yes,\" answered Julian superciliously. \"I knew Mr. Rollins when he was a bell-boy at the Somerset Hotel.\" \"And I knew Mr. Lorimer years before that, when his father and my father were partners in Buffalo.\" Albert Fraser looked from one to the other and smiled at Julian\u0027s angry confusion. \"Rupert,\" he said, \"let me take you up to my sister and introduce you. The grand march will soon begin.\" \"Thank you, Albert.\" Rupert and Edith Fraser led the march, while Julian followed considerably behind, with a fat, red-headed girl of very limited attractions. It was hard upon poor Julian, and his enjoyment was quite taken away by the social success of his quondam friend Rupert. Rupert, on the other hand, enjoyed himself[Pg 362] immensely, and was treated very graciously by his fair partner. * * * * * * * Six months later Mr. Packard called Rupert aside. He was evidently nervous and ill at ease. \"Rupert,\" he said, \"I am going to ask your advice.\" \"If you think my advice worth asking, I shall be glad to give it.\" \"I want you to be plain with me, Rupert Do you think I am too old to be married?\" \"Certainly not, Mr. Packard.\" \"I am forty-five, and I never was very good-looking.\" \"You are a good, kind-hearted man, and any woman ought to be happy with you. But I didn\u0027t know you had made many lady acquaintances.\" \"I haven\u0027t, but there is one lady I should like to marry. I may as well come out with it, Rupert. Do you think your mother would marry me? But—I see you look surprised. I suppose I am a great fool.\" \"You mistake me, Mr. Packard. I am[Pg 363] surprised, for the idea never entered my head before.\" \"I suppose you wouldn\u0027t like the idea,\" said Giles Packard nervously. \"On the contrary, I approve it. Of course I don\u0027t know how mother may look upon it.\" \"But you don\u0027t object to it?\" \"No, Mr. Packard, I wish you success.\" Mrs. Rollins was surprised to receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Packard, but she had learned to know his many good qualities and was grateful to him for his kindness to Rupert, and after a brief time for consideration she gave her consent. There was little change in their way of living, but of course there was an end of pecuniary cares and anxiety for the future. Mr. Packard decided to go into business in New York on his own account. Rupert is his confidential clerk, and has a handsome salary. Mr. Packard\u0027s natural shrewdness has made his venture a success from the start He sold out his Colorado cattle ranch on very favorable terms to two parties from the East,[Pg 364] and now his time is exclusively employed in his New York business. Some time since the Evening World contained the following announcement: \"Mr. Stephen Lorimer, the well-known dry-goods merchant of Third Avenue, is reported in difficulties. A meeting of his creditors has been called, but so serious are his embarrassments that it is doubted whether he will be permitted to go on.\" This prediction was verified. Mr. Lorimer now occupies a position as salesman in a dry-goods house in Chicago, not being willing to fill such a place in any city where he had been in business for himself, and is obliged to live in a very plain way. There was little sympathy felt for him by those who had been in his employ. He had done nothing to win their favor. But Julian is very discontented. He is working in an office at four dollars a week, and feels that life is not worth living under his altered circumstances. Rupert\u0027s real estate has increased largely in value, and he is worth quite a competency in his own right. His young charge, Fred,[Pg 365] has developed a taste for study, and Rupert intends to have him prepare for college. \"You ought to have gone to college yourself,\" said Mr. Packard. \"No,\" answered Rupert. \"I am cut out for business. Fred must be the scholar, and I will be the business man.\" Frank Sylvester, Rupert\u0027s first friend, has returned from Europe, and the friendship between them has been renewed. Though Rupert has been so prosperous, he is never ashamed to refer to the time when he was a bell-boy. Nor does he forget his old friends. Recently he met Leslie Waters standing in front of the Coleman House looking seedy and dilapidated. \"How is the world using you, Leslie?\" he asked. \"Badly, my dear boy,\" answered Leslie, mournfully. \"Our company was stranded at Pittsburg and I had to walk all the way to New York. The profession isn\u0027t what it was.\" \"Then why not leave it? I think I can get you a business position.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82827.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
