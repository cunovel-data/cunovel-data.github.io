{"id":16844,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. AN INGENIOUS TRICK.","content":"One morning a tailor\u0027s boy entered the Somerset Hotel with a bundle which he carried to the clerk. \"It is an overcoat for Mr. Silas Drayton,\" he said. \"Very well,\" said the clerk. \"You can leave it, and we will send it to his room.\" Upon this the boy left the hotel. A young man of twenty-five or thereabouts, who was sitting near by, listened attentively to what passed between the boy and the clerk. The latter summoned Rupert, and said: \"Here is the key of 58. You may take up this coat and leave it in the room. It belongs to Mr. Drayton.\" \"All right, sir.\" Rupert started with the bundle, and the[Pg 252] young man started for the elevator, and got into it just as it was about to ascend. \"I want to go up to No. 58,\" he said. \"Very well.\" When they reached the third floor the elevator boy halted. \"You will find No. 58 on this floor,\" he said. \"Thank you.\" The young man found the room, and was standing in front of it when Rupert made his appearance. \"Is that my uncle\u0027s coat?\" he asked. \"It is Mr. Drayton\u0027s coat.\" \"Exactly. Mr. Drayton is my uncle. You may give it to me, and I will take it in. Have you the key?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then you may give it to me; I came up without one.\" He spoke with such assurance that Rupert, accustomed as he was to impostors, was quite taken in. He handed the package and the key to the young man, who at once opened the door and went into the room. [Pg 253] When Rupert had got half-way down stairs he began to wonder if he had not made a mistake. He did not feel at all sure that the young man to whom he had handed the bundle had any right to claim it. As it might prove to be a serious mistake he went to the clerk and inquired, \"Has Mr. Drayton got a nephew stopping here?\" \"No. Why do you ask?\" \"I am afraid I have made a blunder. At the door of No. 58 I met a young man who told me he was Mr. Drayton\u0027s nephew, and asked me to hand him the bundle.\" \"Did he come down stairs?\" \"No, he went into the room.\" \"I didn\u0027t think you could be so easily imposed upon, Rupert. The man is undoubtedly an adventurer. Describe him.\" Rupert did so. \"He had been sitting in the office for half an hour. He must have seen the tailor\u0027s boy bring in the bundle.\" \"He is upstairs yet. Can\u0027t we get back the coat?\" [Pg 254] \"You will know him when you see him again?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Then take your position by the elevator, and if you see him come down, signal to the detective whom I will also station there. He will take care of him.\" Ten minutes later the elevator reached the office floor. Among those who stepped out was the young man, wearing an overcoat considerably too large for him. It was clear that he had put it on in No. 58, and was now about to wear it out of the hotel. He stepped out of the elevator, and with a slight glance about him made briskly for the door. But he had taken only two steps when Rupert caught him by the arm. \"I want to see you a minute,\" he said. \"I am in a hurry. I have an appointment. I will see you on my return.\" But the detective had now stepped forward. \"You will have to stop now,\" he said, firmly. \"I don\u0027t understand you. By what right do you detain me?\" [Pg 255] \"Where did you get that overcoat you have on?\" \"It is my own. Hasn\u0027t a man a right to wear an overcoat?\" \"Yes, if it belongs to him. This seems too large for you.\" \"True,\" said the young man, \"it belongs to my uncle, Mr. Drayton.\" \"Indeed. Then how do you happen to be wearing it?\" \"I have borrowed it for the day. Really this is very annoying.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Charles Drayton,\" answered the young man, with some hesitation. \"You will have to take off the coat and accompany me to the police station.\" \"This is an outrage!\" exclaimed the young man. \"My uncle will be very angry.\" \"If he identifies you, and assures us that it was by his authority you borrowed the coat, we will apologize.\" \"But that won\u0027t make up to me for your unwarrantable interference. Take the coat and let me go.\" [Pg 256] In spite of his protestations, however, Mr. Charles Drayton, as he called himself, was escorted to the nearest police station and held for examination. He was tried, and would have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, Mr. Silas Drayton disclaiming all relationship, had not the old gentleman taken pity on him and declined to prosecute. It appeared at the trial that the young man was well known to the police as Sidney Marvin, an expert thief, born in London, but for three years a resident of the United States. Mr. Drayton was blamed for allowing him to escape punishment, but he was a soft-hearted man, and disposed to give the young man another chance. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82814.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
