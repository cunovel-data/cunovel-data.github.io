{"id":16835,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. A SCENE AT DELMONICO\u0027S.","content":"The two friends entered Delmonico\u0027s on the Broadway side, and took seats at one of the windows. Rupert, after giving the order, looked about him. He was curious to see that famous restaurant. He was destined to a surprise. At the second table, sitting with his back to Mr. Packard and himself, was a person whom he had the best reason to remember. It was Clarence Clayton. He touched Mr. Packard\u0027s arm, and silently pointed to Clayton. \"Well, I\u0027ll be jiggered!\" exclaimed the cattleman, in surprise. \"That fellow has got nerve.\" Mr. Clayton was evidently enjoying himself. Beside his plate stood a pint bottle of champagne of Delmonico\u0027s special brand.[Pg 175] His dinner would probably involve an expense of five dollars. \"He must have sold or pawned the watch,\" suggested Rupert in a low voice. At this moment Clayton looked around. He at once recognized the two whom he had last seen at the Battery. \"So we meet again?\" he said, coolly. \"Yes,\" answered the cattleman. \"You appear to be having a pleasant time.\" \"I generally do,\" returned Clayton. \"You seem to have negotiated a loan.\" \"I met a party who seemed to know more about gold watches than you do.\" \"I congratulate you,\" said Packard, dryly. Clayton returned to the discussion of his dinner, and soon the two friends were served. \"Shall I order some champagne, Rupert?\" asked the man from Colorado. \"Not for me. I have promised my mother to avoid drink.\" \"You are wise. Far be it from me to tempt you. I have seen too much of the evil done by intemperance.\" Clarence Clayton evidently had no such[Pg 176] objection to drink. He drained the bottle, and calling for a cigar, leaned back in his chair, with a self-satisfied smile. \"That fellow is a curiosity,\" Packard said. \"He probably has good abilities, and would meet with success in an honest career. He has made poor use of his talents. I wonder if he ever reflects upon the inevitable end of his dishonesty?\" \"It doesn\u0027t seem to trouble him much,\" returned Rupert. Neither he nor Clayton observed the quiet entrance of a small, unobtrusive man, with sharp eyes, who, taking rapid glances at the guests, moved towards the table occupied by the adventurer. Sitting in pleasant enjoyment of his cigar, Clayton\u0027s attention was drawn by a slight tap on his shoulder. Looking up in momentary impatience he saw the newcomer at his side. Stifling an ejaculation he stared at him in dismay. \"Mr. Clayton,\" said Detective Darke, in a low voice, \"I see you know me.\" [Pg 177] \"No, I can\u0027t say I have the pleasure,\" stammered Clayton. \"You are polite to call it a pleasure. I am Richard Darke.\" \"Can I offer you a glass of champagne, Mr. Darke?\" \"There doesn\u0027t seem to be any left in the bottle.\" \"I will order another.\" \"I won\u0027t put you to that trouble. I have business with you, and must request you to go with me.\" \"But——\" \"I can take no denial,\" said the detective, sharply. \"Go up to the desk, settle your bill, and then we will go out together. There will be no scene, and no one will know my errand, if you obey my directions.\" Clayton went up to the desk, paid his check, and then, turning to the detective, said, \"I am at your service.\" By this time Rupert noticed what was going on, and silently called the attention of Mr. Packard to it. [Pg 178] \"Poor chap!\" said the cattleman, as Clayton and his unwelcome companion left the restaurant, \"his punishment has come sooner than I anticipated. He will be punished, but I am afraid the owner of the watch stands a poor chance of recovering his property.\" \"Probably he will get possession of the pawn ticket and so secure the watch, though it may cost him twenty-five dollars.\" \"It will be some time before the thief gets another such dinner as he has eaten to-night.\" After supper Packard said, \"Are you feeling tired, Rupert?\" \"Oh, no, sir.\" \"Then suppose we go to some theatre.\" \"All right, sir. What theatre do you prefer?\" \"I leave the choice to you.\" \"Palmer\u0027s Theatre is very near.\" \"Then let us go there.\" They reached the theatre just as the curtain was rising. Mr. Packard bought two choice seats, and they were soon seated in the orchestra. As soon as he had a chance to[Pg 179] look about him, Rupert discovered to his surprise that Mr. Lorimer and Julian were sitting directly in front of him. At the sound of his voice Julian turned, and was greatly surprised to see the bell-boy occupying as high-priced a seat as himself. When the first act was ended, he took measures to gratify his curiosity. \"I am surprised to see you here,\" he said. \"It is a mutual surprise,\" responded Rupert. \"You know what I mean. It is not usual to meet bell-boys in orchestra seats.\" \"I was not asked at the ticket office what was my employment.\" \"Are you here alone?\" \"No; let me introduce my friend, Mr. Packard, of Colorado.\" Julian glanced at the cattleman, and was not impressed. Mr. Packard\u0027s clothing was by no means stylish. Julian naturally supposed him to be a person of small means and no particular consequence. He gave him a slight nod, and turned his face towards the stage. [Pg 180] \"What is the name of that boy?\" asked the cattleman. \"Julian Lorimer.\" \"Is he related to Stephen Lorimer?\" \"Stephen Lorimer is his father. Do you know him?\" asked Rupert, in surprise. \"Stephen Lorimer is a cousin of mine.\" \"There he is, next to Julian.\" Mr. Lorimer\u0027s ears caught the sound of his own name, and, turning, he recognized Rupert, but not his cousin. \"You here, Rupert Rollins?\" he said, in surprise. \"Yes, sir. Do you know this gentleman with me?\" Stephen Lorimer regarded the cattleman blankly. \"No,\" he answered slowly. \"I don\u0027t know him.\" \"Perhaps you will remember the name of Giles Packard,\" said the cattleman, but his tone was cold and not cordial. \"Are you Giles Packard?\" \"Yes.\" Stephen Lorimer looked embarrassed. [Pg 181] \"I hope you are prosperous,\" he said. \"Thank you—I am doing well now.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"In Colorado.\" \"Ah! Mines?\" \"No, cattle.\" \"Call and see me. Rupert will tell you where I may be found.\" \"I may do so.\" \"Is he a cowboy?\" asked Julian, in an audible whisper. Giles Packard heard the words and he looked at Rupert with a smile. \"He is like his father,\" he said. They did not again speak. After the play Stephen Lorimer went out of the theatre without even a look at his new-found relative. Rupert and the man from Colorado, following slowly, made the best of their way down Broadway to the Somerset House. \"How came you to know Stephen Lorimer?\" asked Packard. \"He and my father were in business together in Buffalo some years since. They failed, and I have always believed that my[Pg 182] father was defrauded. At any rate he lost everything, while his old partner had money enough to start in the dry-goods business in New York.\" \"History repeats itself,\" said Packard. \"Many years ago, when I was twenty-two, I was the partner of Stephen Lorimer.\" \"You!\" \"Yes. In fact I furnished three-fourths of the capital. At the end of eighteen months we failed. I never could understand why, for our business had been good. Stephen kept the books, and I examined without being able to understand them. The upshot of it was that I was thrown upon the world penniless, while he soon went into business for himself in another place. I have not seen Lorimer for twenty years, till accident brought us together to-night.\" \"I am glad you are prosperous again.\" \"Yes. I have far more money than when I belonged to the firm of Lorimer \u0026 Packard.\" \"Perhaps Mr. Lorimer would take you in as partner again.\" \"I have no desire to be associated with him in any way. I believe him to be a thoroughly dishonest man. I am sorry that your father has suffered also at his hands.\" Rupert accompanied Mr. Packard to the hotel, having agreed to relieve another bell-boy from midnight till six o\u0027clock the next morning. When he reached the hotel he found it a scene of excitement. The bell of No. 61 had been ringing violently for some time. The other bell-boy had come downstairs in a panic. \"I can\u0027t get into No. 61,\" he reported. \"There is somebody dead or murdered there.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82805.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
