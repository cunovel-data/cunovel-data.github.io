{"id":16821,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. A FALSE REPORT.","content":"\"What was the name of the gentleman in Harlem from whom you say you obtained the purse?\" asked the lawyer. \"Mr. Frank Sylvester,\" answered Rupert, promptly. The lawyer looked interested. \"I know Mr. Sylvester,\" he said. \"I live on the same street.\" \"He gave me this basket of provisions also,\" added Rupert. \"Why did he give you the purse?\" \"Because I met him down town feeling ill, and at his request went home with him.\" \"The boy is all right,\" said the lawyer, looking satisfied. \"Here is the purse. It is undoubtedly yours.\" \"And where do I come in?\" asked the young woman. \"Is that boy going off with my money?\" [Pg 33] Just then they reached the next station, and among those who boarded the train was a policeman. The girl evidently recognized him, for she turned away to escape attention. Before the officer had a chance to speak to her the old lady broke in with: \"Policeman, there\u0027s a poor girl been robbed of her purse by that boy, and that gentleman there is protecting him.\" The policeman laughed. \"So, Kate, you have had your purse stolen, have you?\" he asked. The girl looked embarrassed. \"I may be mistaken,\" she admitted. \"I am afraid you have been up to one of your tricks.\" \"Do you know the girl?\" asked the lawyer. \"I have arrested her more than once for playing a confidence game. It is only three weeks since I had her up before the Jefferson Market Police Court.\" \"Well, I declare!\" exclaimed the old lady, astounded. The girl sprang from her seat when the next station was reached, and hastily left the car. [Pg 34] \"My boy,\" said the lawyer, \"I must ask your pardon for doubting you even for a moment. This good lady, too, ought to apologize to you.\" The old lady sniffed contemptuously. \"I never apologize to boys,\" she said. \"Then, madam, take care you don\u0027t do them injustice,\" said the lawyer gravely. \"I am old enough to manage my own affairs,\" cried the old lady, with asperity. \"You are certainly old enough, but——\" \"Don\u0027t you speak to me again, sir.\" The lawyer smiled, and crossing the car sat down at Rupert\u0027s side. \"My boy,\" he said, \"you came near getting into a scrape because you did not know how much the purse contained. Suppose you count the money now.\" Rupert took out the purse and followed this friendly advice. To his gratification and surprise he found a ten-dollar gold piece and two dollars and a half in silver. His face expressed the joy he felt. \"That is a godsend,\" he said. \"Do you think Mr. Sylvester knew about the gold?\" [Pg 35] \"I have no doubt of it. He is a very kind-hearted and generous man. You may keep the money without hesitation.\" The time soon came when Rupert was to leave the Elevated train. He hurried home with joyful heart, feeling that he was carrying good news. When he entered the little room he found his mother again in an attitude of despondency. \"What is the matter, mother?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t know what we shall do, Rupert,\" she said. \"I went round to Mr. Jacob Grubb\u0027s clothing store this afternoon for more work, and he said business was so dull he would not have any more work for a month.\" \"Then you can take a vacation, mother,\" said Rupert, lightly. \"But how shall we live in that case, Rupert? You are out of work.\" \"Mother, don\u0027t worry. I have made more to-day than in any week when I had regular work. First, here is a basketful of provisions,\" and he removed the cover from the basket, displaying the contents. \"Have you had supper yet?\" [Pg 36] \"No.\" \"Then suppose you make some tea, and we will have a nice supper.\" \"You didn\u0027t buy those provisions, Rupert?\" \"No, they were given me by a new friend. But that isn\u0027t all. What do you say to this?\" and he emptied the purse on the table. \"Truly you have been fortunate,\" said Mrs. Rollins, with new cheerfulness. \"It has come in good time, too, for our rent will fall due on Saturday.\" \"Then, mother, you had better take this money, and take care of it till it is wanted.\" Just as Mrs. Rollins was placing the purse in a bureau drawer Mrs. Marlow, who lived on the floor below, opened the door and entered the room without knocking. \"Excuse my comin\u0027 in without knockin\u0027,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t think.\" Mrs. Marlow was in the habit of moving about in a noiseless, stealthy way, and was not a favorite with Rupert or his mother. They felt that there was something suspicious and underhanded about her. [Pg 37] \"What can I do for you, Mrs. Marlow?\" asked Mrs. Rollins, civilly. \"I\u0027m all out of matches. Can you give me a few?\" \"Certainly.\" Mrs. Marlow took the matches, but did not go. She sank into a chair and grew social. \"And how is the times affectin\u0027 you, Mrs. Rollins?\" she asked. \"Rupert is out of employment. All he has to depend upon are odd jobs.\" Mrs. Marlow darted a curious glance at the bureau drawer in which her neighbor had deposited the purse. \"It don\u0027t make so much difference as long as a body has got money to fall back upon,\" she said. \"That is not my condition.\" \"I\u0027m sorry for it. I surmised you might have money ahead. You\u0027re better off than I am, for I have no boy to work for me.\" \"If I am better off than anybody,\" said Mrs. Rollins, with a faint smile, \"I suppose I ought not to complain.\" \"My! What a nice lot of provisions!\"[Pg 38] exclaimed Mrs. Marlow, espying for the first time the open basket. \"Sure, you buy things by the quantity.\" \"That was a present to Rupert from a rich gentleman whose acquaintance he made.\" \"It\u0027s a nice thing to have rich friends. Rupert, would you mind tellin\u0027 the gentleman that you know a poor widder that would be thankful for his kind assistance?\" \"I don\u0027t feel well enough acquainted with Mr. Sylvester for that,\" said Rupert, annoyed. \"Sure his name is Sylvester, is it? And where does he live?\" \"In Harlem.\" \"And what\u0027s the street and number?\" \"I should prefer not to tell you.\" \"Ah, it\u0027s selfish you are. You want to keep him to yourself.\" \"I don\u0027t expect to see him again.\" \"Then why do you mind tellin\u0027 me where he lives?\" \"I don\u0027t want to annoy him.\" Mrs. Marlow turned her attention to his mother. \"Would you mind givin\u0027 me a small bit[Pg 39] of meat for my supper, you\u0027ve got so much?\" she said. Her request was complied with, and she at length left the room. \"What a disagreeable woman!\" exclaimed Rupert. \"She was prying about all the time she was here.\" \"Yes. I don\u0027t enjoy her company much, but I can\u0027t order her out of the room.\" They had a nice supper, which Mrs. Rollins and Grace enjoyed. Rupert sat down at the table, but confined himself to a cup of tea, having already supped at Mr. Sylvester\u0027s. The next day he resumed his hunt for a place, knowing well that his good luck of the day previous would not take the place of regular employment. But in dull times searching for a place is discouraging work. He was indeed offered a position in a drug store up town at three dollars a week, but there were two objections to accepting it. The small pay would not more than half defray the expenses of their little household, and, besides, the hours would be very long. Resolving to leave no means untried, [Pg 40]Rupert decided to remain out till five o\u0027clock. Perhaps something might turn up for him at the last moment. He was walking in front of the Metropolitan Hotel when a boy hailed him in evident surprise. \"Are you all right?\" he asked. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I be all right, George?\" asked Rupert, in great surprise. \"I thought you had broken your leg.\" \"Who told you such nonsense?\" \"There was a slip of paper brought to your mother early this afternoon, saying that you had been run over by a horse car, and had been carried into a drug store near Thirtieth Street.\" Rupert was amazed. \"Who brought the paper?\" \"A messenger boy.\" \"And I suppose my mother was very much frightened?\" \"She went out directly, and took the car up to Thirtieth Street.\" \"What can it mean?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said George Parker, shaking his head. \"I am glad it isn\u0027t true.\" [Pg 41] \"If anybody played this trick on purpose, I\u0027d like to give him a good shaking.\" \"You\u0027d better go home and let your mother know you are all right.\" \"I will.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82791.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
