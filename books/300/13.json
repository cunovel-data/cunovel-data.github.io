{"id":16830,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. CLAYTON\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT.","content":"Josiah Onthank never for a moment doubted the good faith of the clever swindler who was dazzling him with the prospect of a fine situation for his son. He was a man well to do, and over and above his farm was easily worth five thousand dollars in bonds and money interest. Still he was reluctant to part with a hundred and fifty dollars, for this seemed to him a good deal of money. Yet if it would secure his son a position in the city with a large income it would be worth while. At any rate he would lay the matter before Rupert, and ask his advice. During the afternoon he had a chance to speak with the bell-boy. \"I\u0027ve got something to tell you,\" he said. \"All right, sir.\" [Pg 125] \"I\u0027ve seen the young man I spoke to you about.\" \"Did he make you any offer?\" \"Yes; he promised to give my son a place in his office at seventy-five dollars a month.\" \"Where is his office?\" \"In Wall Street. It\u0027s big and fine. He must do a raft of business.\" \"He is very kind to give your son a place.\" \"Yes, but he wants a premium of a hundred and fifty dollars. That\u0027s what bothers me. A hundred and fifty dollars is a pile of money. What do you think of it?\" \"If you could really get a place for your son at seventy-five dollars a month—a permanent place—it would be worth the money.\" \"So \u0027twould, so \u0027twould. Then you\u0027d advise me to pay the money?\" \"He wants it in advance, doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you get into the office?\" \"Yes.\" \"How do you know it is his?\" \"He told me so,\" answered Mr. Onthank, in surprise. [Pg 126] \"Is that all the evidence you have?\" \"He went and spoke to one of the men—his cashier, he told me. You don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything wrong, do you?\" \"I think, Mr. Onthank, the man is trying to swindle you.\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" ejaculated the farmer. \"Have you given him any money?\" \"No. Yes, come to think on\u0027t, I have. I gave him five dollars for a refusal of the place. He said another man was after it.\" \"You haven\u0027t lost much yet. If you should give him a hundred and fifty dollars you would lose it all.\" \"What makes you think so? He seems like a gentleman.\" \"My information comes from a private detective.\" \"Well, well, I guess I\u0027ve been a fool,\" said the farmer, in a tone of disappointment and mortification. \"What do you advise me to do?\" \"I will consult with the detective first, and tell you.\" The next day Clarence Clayton made his[Pg 127] appearance. Though, not quite so sanguine as at first, he still hoped to carry out his original plan and obtain possession of the bulk of the farmer\u0027s money. He found Mr. Onthank waiting for him in the reading room. \"Well, my friend,\" he said, \"I presume you have made up your mind to secure a position for your son?\" \"You don\u0027t think you could let me have it for less?\" asked Mr. Onthank, who had been instructed what to say. \"I don\u0027t see how I can. Nor can I give you long to decide. The other party is waiting for me at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and if you don\u0027t come to terms he will.\" \"You see it\u0027s rather a risk,\" said the farmer. \"Suppose I pay my money and you don\u0027t keep your part of the agreement.\" \"You seem to be very suspicious, Mr. Onthank,\" returned Clayton, assuming indignation. \"I am well known in the city as a man of the highest honor.\" \"Just so,\" said the farmer. \"Still, I should like to have you give me a paper, agreein\u0027 to[Pg 128] give Ephraim a position. Then I should feel safe.\" \"I see no objection to that,\" said Clayton. \"I\u0027ll make it out here.\" He sat down at the table, and in a few minutes handed Ezekiel Onthank the following agreement: \"In consideration of a hundred and fifty dollars paid to me by Mr. Ezekiel Onthank, of Orange County, New York, I hereby promise to give his son Ephraim a place in my Wall Street office, with a salary to begin with of seventy-five dollars per month. The engagement is to commence on the first of next month. Clarence Clayton.\" \"Is that satisfactory, Mr. Onthank?\" he asked. \"I reckon so,\" said the farmer, reading the document slowly. \"Do you want the money to-day?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Then I will go and get it.\" Mr. Clayton leaned back in his chair in a pleasant frame of mind. He chuckled to himself as he thought of the ease with which he had imposed upon his rural dupe. [Pg 129] \"Mr. Onthank thinks he is sharp,\" he soliloquized. \"He may change his opinion after awhile.\" The farmer did not keep him waiting long. He re-entered the reading room, but not alone. Richard Darke was with him. Clarence Clayton started to his feet in dismay. He recognized the detective at once. \"Sit down, Mr. Clayton,\" said Darke, smoothly. \"I see you have been doing a stroke of business with my friend, Mr. Onthank.\" Clayton did not speak. He did not know what to say. \"Let me see the paper, Mr. Onthank.\" The farmer handed it to the detective, who read it aloud slowly. \"You agree to give his son a situation in your Wall Street office? By the way, where is the office?\" and the detective bent a penetrating glance on the face of the adventurer. \"I believe I made a little mistake,\" muttered Clayton. \"Give me back the paper, and I will correct it.\" \"It is quite immaterial. It will do as it[Pg 130] stands. You have not told me where your office is.\" \"I took him into it.\" \"Have you given him any money, Mr. Onthank?\" \"I gave him five dollars yesterday.\" \"What for?\" \"To get the refusal of the place.\" \"Very good. I see Mr. Clayton is a man of business. On the whole, however, I don\u0027t think you have got full value for your money. Young man, I will trouble you to return the five dollars to my country friend.\" \"I—I am afraid I haven\u0027t got it with me,\" said Clayton, uncomfortably. \"How much have you?\" After searching his pockets the adventurer produced two dollars. \"Will it be convenient for you to remain in the city and prosecute this man?\" asked the detective, turning to the farmer. \"No—no. I want to leave town this afternoon.\" \"Then I am afraid we shall have to let him go. The three dollars you have lost you must[Pg 131] consider paid for experience. If it makes you more cautious in future it will be well expended.\" \"So \u0027twill, so \u0027twill,\" said the farmer. \"Much obleeged to ye, squire, for gettin\u0027 me out of a scrape.\" \"You are still more indebted to the young bell-boy,\" indicating Rupert. \"Let me suggest that you can\u0027t do better than to offer him the money you have saved from our sharp friend here.\" \"I\u0027ll do better than that,\" said the farmer. \"I will give him ten dollars. He has saved me from making a fool of myself.\" \"You see, Clayton,\" said the detective, \"that it is better to be honest than a knave. The bell-boy has made more in this affair than you.\" \"Can I go?\" asked Clayton, crestfallen. \"Yes, and don\u0027t let me see you here again. I shall have my eye on you, and the next time you won\u0027t get off so easily.\" Clayton lost no time in availing himself of this permission. In sadness and disappointment he left the hotel, inwardly resolving never to enter it again. [Pg 132] \"Why wasn\u0027t I satisfied with the five dollars?\" he asked himself. \"Confound that young bell-boy! He has spoiled my game. But for him I would be able to live in clover for a couple of months.\" The farmer started on his return to Orange County in the afternoon. Before going he handed Rupert a ten-dollar bill. The bell-boy was surprised. He knew nothing of Mr. Darke\u0027s recommendation, and did not expect such liberality from Ezekiel Onthank, whom he looked upon as a poor man. \"I don\u0027t think I ought to take it, Mr. Onthank,\" he said. \"You needn\u0027t hesitate, sonny. I can afford it. I don\u0027t wear as good clothes as the young sprig that tried to swindle me, but I ain\u0027t a poor man by no means. If you ever have time to pay me a visit in Orange County I\u0027ll make you welcome and see that you have a good time.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Onthank. If I should hear of a good situation for your son I will let you know, and I won\u0027t charge a hundred[Pg 133] and fifty dollars for it, either. I haven\u0027t got an office in Wall Street, though.\" \"That was a good joke. That \u0027ere Clayton was a pooty smart rascal, after all.\" \"Ho, ho!\" laughed the farmer. \"Shall you invite him to visit you in Orange County, Mr. Onthank?\" \"I guess he wouldn\u0027t accept. We live plain, and he\u0027s a rich Wall Street broker. But we\u0027ll be glad to see you at any time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82800.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
