{"id":16837,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. MR. PACKARD\u0027S GIFT.","content":"It was not until the next day that Giles Packard knew of the tragedy in No. 61. He had gone to bed at once on reaching the hotel, and had not heard of Rupert\u0027s adopting a child. \"What is this I hear, Rupert?\" he asked, on meeting the bell-boy. \"I hear you have an adopted son.\" \"Yes,\" answered Rupert, with a smile. \"Won\u0027t you get tired of the care and responsibility?\" \"I think not.\" \"Besides, there will be considerable expense.\" \"The money left by his father will pay that till I am older and am earning more.\" \"Not many boys of your age would dare to assume such a charge.\" [Pg 192] \"Perhaps not, but Fred is such a sweet boy I cannot help loving him.\" \"Look here, Rupert, won\u0027t you let me share the expense? I am rich and have no family ties?\" \"Thank you, Mr. Packard. I am very much obliged to you, but I should like to feel that I am Fred\u0027s sole guardian. I want him to learn to love me.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you are right. I won\u0027t interfere if you don\u0027t wish me to.\" That evening Rupert took Fred to Mr. Benton\u0027s. \"I have brought you another boarder,\" he said. Mrs. Benton looked surprised. \"Is it a relation of yours?\" she asked. \"He is my son.\" The good lady looked amazed. \"My adopted son,\" amended Rupert, with a smile; and then he told her of the sudden death at the hotel, and little Fred\u0027s bereavement. Mrs. Benton\u0027s heart went out to the little orphan, and she stooped and kissed him. [Pg 193] \"Will you live with me?\" she asked. \"I am going to live with him,\" said little Fred, taking Rupert\u0027s hand. \"He will live here, too.\" \"Then I will stay,\" answered the child, gravely. \"I am to stay with him till papa comes back.\" They had told the little boy that his father had gone on a long journey, and wished him to stay with Rupert during his absence. He had acquiesced quietly, for he was a docile child, and transferred his affection to Rupert, of whose love he felt assured. \"Now, Mrs. Benton, I must make a bargain with you for Fred\u0027s board.\" Mrs. Benton at first refused to accept anything, protesting that a child would be little expense, but Rupert told her that the father had left money, and finally induced her to accept three dollars a week. \"I am afraid that is too little,\" said the bell-boy. \"No; it will help pay the rent, and I shall like to have Freddie here as a companion for Harry.\" [Pg 194] So it was arranged, and the little boy was provided with a happy and comfortable home at small expense. Two days later Giles Packard sought out Rupert during an interval of the bell-boy\u0027s labors. \"How is the little boy?\" asked the cattleman. \"He is well, and he seems to be happy. He thinks his father is away on a journey.\" \"The journey we must all take some time,\" said Packard, gravely. \"Then you won\u0027t accept my help towards paying for the child\u0027s maintenance?\" \"It won\u0027t be necessary, Mr. Packard. I am to pay only three dollars a week for his board.\" \"His clothing will cost something.\" \"Mrs. Benton will manage that. She says it won\u0027t cost over fifty dollars a year.\" \"I foresaw that you wouldn\u0027t let me help support the boy, so I have got even with you in another way.\" \"How is that?\" asked Rupert, puzzled. Mr. Packard, smiled. [Pg 195] \"I decided to make you a present,\" he said. \"You won\u0027t refuse that?\" \"No; I am sure you are a good friend, and I won\u0027t reject your kindness.\" Rupert fancied Mr. Packard might be intending to give him fifty dollars, or something like that, and he felt that it would be ungracious to refuse. The man from Colorado drew from his pocket a large-sized envelope, and from it took a legal document. \"This,\" he said, \"is a deed of two lots in Harlem, not far from One-hundred-and-twenty-fifth Street. The deed is made out to you, and establishes your ownership.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you had any lots in Harlem,\" said Rupert, in surprise. \"Neither had I till yesterday. I bought them through a real estate agent on Third Avenue, after carefully considering several others.\" \"But, Mr. Packard, they must have cost you a good deal of money.\" \"Two thousand dollars.\" \"And you give me such a valuable present?\" [Pg 196] \"Yes, Rupert, and I am glad to do so. Don\u0027t think I have pinched myself to do it. I am a rich man, and I haven\u0027t a chick or child, except—well, except you,\" he continued, with a smile. \"I don\u0027t know that I ought to accept such a handsome present, though I fully appreciate your great kindness.\" \"I don\u0027t quite see that you have any choice. The deed is made out in your name, and in due time you will find that you will have to pay taxes on them.\" \"Then I suppose I must submit. I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\" \"Then don\u0027t do it. It would make me feel awkward. I will give you some good advice before I leave you. Those lots I believe will advance in price very rapidly. Building is going on very near them, and they are in the path of improvement. My advice is that you hold on to them at least five years. They may realize you a small fortune.\" \"I will certainly be guided by your advice. Do you know, Mr. Packard, I imagine[Pg 197] there are very few bell-boys in New York who are as rich as I am?\" \"I don\u0027t think I have ever heard of a bell-boy millionaire,\" said the cattleman, smiling, \"though I hope the one before me may make the first exception to a general rule. Did I tell you that I expect to start on my return to Colorado to-morrow?\" \"So soon as that?\" \"Yes; I have received news from my agent there—good news, mind—that makes it advisable for me to abridge my visit. May I hope that you will write me sometimes?\" \"I shall be glad to do so, Mr. Packard.\" \"Mind, it is a compact. Some time I expect you to visit me out there.\" \"When my child gets a little older,\" said Rupert, with a smile. \"And if at any time you find the expense too great for your means, let me help you.\" \"I will.\" So the two friends parted, and Rupert resumed his regular routine as a bell-boy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82807.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
