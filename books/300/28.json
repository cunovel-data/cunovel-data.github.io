{"id":16845,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. RUPERT RESIGNS HIS SITUATION.","content":"Rupert had been a bell-boy for more than a year. He found his employers very pleasant and considerate, and his salary was larger, probably, than he could get anywhere else. Still the position was not likely to lead to anything better, unless he might in time qualify himself to be a hotel clerk. Sometimes he talked over the matter with Leslie, but the latter had the advantage of knowing just what he aspired to. He was determined some day to be an actor, and was content to remain in his present place till there was an opening for him on the stage. One day Rupert received a letter from Colorado. He knew, of course, that the letter was written by his old acquaintance, Giles Packard, from whom he heard occasionally. This was the letter: \"Friend Rupert— \"I have been meaning for some time to write to[Pg 258] you, but my mode of life is not favorable to letter-writing, and whenever I take my pen in hand I feel as awkward as a Chinaman would with a knife and fork. I think it is three months since I heard from you, but I hope you are well and getting on nicely. How is the little boy you took charge of? It was a pretty big responsibility for a lad of your age, but I am sure you would take better care of him than a good many older persons. \"Don\u0027t forget that you promised to let me know if you needed some help. Even small boys cost something to bring up, and I have plenty, while you are only beginning life. I suppose you are still a bell-boy at the Somerset Hotel. Now that is a good position for a boy, but it seems to me that it is about time you took up something else. Before choosing what it shall be, I want you to come out and make me a visit. I feel pretty lonely sometimes, having neither \u0027chick nor child,\u0027 unless I count you. I think it would do you good to see a little something of the far West. I inclose a draft for two hundred dollars for your expenses out here. If all is right I want you either to ask for a vacation or leave your situation, and start as soon as you can. Don\u0027t be afraid, for I will see that you don\u0027t suffer, even if you don\u0027t get a new place right off.\" Here followed some directions as to finding him, and then the letter ended. The proposal struck Rupert favorably. He[Pg 259] had a natural desire to travel, and had a great anxiety to see Chicago and other places, of which he had heard a great deal. He went at once to the proprietor of the hotel and showed him the letter. \"You want to accept the invitation, I suppose?\" said the landlord. \"Yes, sir, if it won\u0027t inconvenience you.\" \"As it happens, one of my old friends wants me to give his son a place in the hotel. I had thought of discharging Leslie to make room for him, but if you really wish to give up your position I will put him in your place.\" \"That will suit me, sir.\" \"But in that case I cannot take you back on your return.\" \"I will not expect you to do so. I think I can find something outside, and Mr. Packard agreed to see me through.\" \"That draft looks like it. I will send for the boy at once, and during the balance of the week you can instruct him in his duties.\" \"I am sorry you are going, Rupert,\" said Leslie. \"If you get acquainted with any[Pg 260] managers on your Western trip, speak a good word for me.\" \"I will.\" \"I am going to play at a benefit next week, Wednesday. It is a variety entertainment, and I am to give imitations of celebrated actors. I\u0027ve got Irving down fine. You ought to stay and see me.\" \"Perhaps you will give me a private rehearsal. It wouldn\u0027t be convenient for me to put off my journey.\" \"I will. Come into my room to-night, and you shall see me imitate Irving, Booth and Joe Jefferson.\" Rupert stayed two days in Chicago, and visited the principal localities, including Jackson Park, soon to become known all over the country as the site of the World\u0027s Fair. He was impressed with the business activity and greatness of the Queen City of the West, and left it reluctantly at the end of two days. At the railroad station, while purchasing his ticket to Denver, his attention was called to a tall old man who looked to be nearly seventy. He was thin and bent, and his face was sad.[Pg 261] His suit was black, but it was well-worn and looked shabby. His eyes were fixed on Rupert as he bought his ticket, and he heaved a sigh. \"I envy you, young man,\" he said in answer to Rupert\u0027s inquiring look. \"Why so?\" asked the bell-boy. \"Because you are going to Denver.\" \"Do you wish to go there?\" \"Yes, but it is impossible.\" \"Why is that? Won\u0027t your business permit you?\" \"Alas, I have no business. I came to Chicago from my old home in Rochester, New York, hoping to get a situation as bookkeeper. I understand bookkeeping thoroughly, and for fifteen years occupied that position in one of the largest firms in Buffalo. But they went out of business, and I was thrown on my own resources.\" \"Had you not laid up any money?\" \"Yes. I took what I had, and went by invitation to make my home at the house of a niece in Rochester who was married to a man named Jackson. I had three thousand [Pg 262]dollars, and I thought that if I should get something to do I might with the help of that live comfortably for the balance of my days. That was a year ago, and I was then sixty-five. I can hardly expect to live many years, and I considered myself well provided for. \"Well, I sought out my niece, and was cordially received by her husband and herself after they learned that I had money. I agreed to board with them, and sought a position in my old line. But a man over sixty is at a disadvantage when he is seeking employment. In vain I showed a first-class recommendation from my past employers in Buffalo. \"\u0027I dare say you understand your business,\u0027 one and another said to me, \u0027but you are too old for us. We want a young man who can hustle.\u0027 \"\u0027But I can hustle, too,\u0027 I said. \"They only laughed. \"\u0027You are too old to work. You ought to retire,\u0027 they said. \"I reported my disappointment to my niece and her husband. [Pg 263] \"\u0027Uncle John,\u0027 said my nephew, \u0027I feel for you, and I will try to do something for you. I think I can make a place for you in my store. I can\u0027t afford to pay you high wages. If you will work for ten dollars a week I will employ you.\u0027 \"I was very glad to accept this proposal, though I had in my time been paid a hundred dollars a month. \"I entered the store, and had reason to think that I was doing satisfactory work. But at the end of three weeks Eben Jackson called me aside and said: \u0027Uncle John, I have been figuring up my expenses, and I don\u0027t see how I can afford to employ you.\u0027 \"\u0027You wish me to go, then?\u0027 \"\u0027I shall have to dispense with your services unless I can get additional capital to enlarge my business.\u0027 \"Presently he made me a proposal. \"\u0027If you will lend me three thousand dollars,\u0027 he said, \u0027and allow me to use it in my business, I will pay you six per cent. interest, and advance your wages to twelve dollars a week.\u0027 [Pg 264] \"I thought over this proposal and determined to accept it. Eben Jackson was very plausible and smooth-spoken, and I saw no reason to doubt him. I transferred my small capital to him. He increased his stock, but only by five hundred dollars\u0027 worth, as I afterwards ascertained, and I continued to work for him. For a month he paid me twelve dollars per week, then he reduced me to ten, on the plea that business was poor, afterwards to eight, and finally he allowed me only my board. I became indignant and demanded my money back, but he absolutely refused to repay it. I consulted a lawyer, but found upon inquiry that he had made over all his property to his wife. I saw that nothing was to be expected, and a month since I left Rochester and came to Chicago, in the hope of finding employment here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82815.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
