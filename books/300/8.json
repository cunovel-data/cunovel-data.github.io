{"id":16825,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. JULIAN LORIMER.","content":"On Monday Rupert saw his mother and sister established at Rutherford. Their new home was a large old-fashioned mansion, exceedingly comfortable. One of the best chambers was assigned to Mrs. Rollins, with a small room opening out of it for Grace. Benjamin Strathmore was a stout old gentleman of seventy, tall, and patriarchal-looking with his abundant white hair. \"How do you like my selection of housekeeper, Uncle Ben?\" asked Sylvester, when he had a chance to be alone with the old gentleman. \"She will just suit me,\" said Mr. Strathmore, emphatically. \"She is evidently a lady, and she will be an agreeable companion if I am not mistaken. Mrs. Martin was a good housekeeper, but she had no idea [Pg 74]outside of her duties. I could not chat with her unless I talked about cooking. My evenings were solitary. She spent the time in the kitchen or in her own room. Now the house will be really social.\" \"I am delighted to have suited you, Uncle Ben.\" \"Where in the world did you come across Mrs. Rollins? Have you known her long?\" \"I became acquainted through her son Rupert, to whom I introduced you.\" \"He seems a fine, manly boy. He can stay here, too. I will find something for him to do.\" \"Thank you, Uncle Ben, but I shall find him a place in New York. He prefers the city, and it will afford him more opportunities of advancement. Rupert is ambitious, and I predict that he will rise in time to an excellent position.\" \"Just as you think best, Frank; but remember that if ever there is need, or he becomes sick, there is room for him here.\" To anticipate a little. Mr. Strathmore was not disappointed in Mrs. Rollins. It came to[Pg 75] be her custom to spend the evenings with her employer. Sometimes she read aloud to him. At others, while she was engaged in needlework, and Grace, now restored to health, was occupied with her books, the old gentleman sat back in his easy chair, and with calm content watched his companions. He no longer felt his former burden of solitude. \"I have never been happier,\" he wrote later on to his nephew. \"I regretted the loss of Mrs. Martin, but now I feel that it was for my happiness, since it has opened the way for such an acceptable substitute.\" Rupert went at first to the house of Mr. Sylvester, where their acquaintance soon ripened into friendship. They were walking down Broadway one day, when Frank Sylvester noticed a sudden start on the part of his young companion. \"What is the matter, Rupert?\" he asked. \"Do you see that stout man on the opposite side of the street, Mr. Sylvester?\" said Rupert. \"Yes. What of him?\" \"He was the cause of my poor father\u0027s failure and death.\" [Pg 76] \"How was that?\" \"My father was a merchant in Buffalo, and that man was his partner. During a three months\u0027 absence in California, where he went partly for his health, the business was managed by Mr. Lorimer in such a way that the firm became deeply involved and was brought to the brink of failure. \"My father was greatly astonished at the sudden change, for when he left all was prosperous. He could not account for the disappearance of assets and the accumulation of claims against the firm except on the theory that large sums had been appropriated by his partner. He could prove nothing, however, and the firm was dissolved. When the business was closed there was barely enough money left to pay the creditors. My father found himself with nothing, and soon died of grief and mortification.\" \"What became of Lorimer?\" \"I have not seen him till to-day. I heard that he had come to New York and established himself on Third Avenue somewhere, in the same business. If so, he must have[Pg 77] had capital, and this must have been the sum of which he defrauded my father.\" \"The story is a sad one, Rupert. You and your mother must have suffered from the change in circumstances.\" \"We did. We did not care to stay in Buffalo, where we had been accustomed to live in good style, so we came to New York, where we could live according to our change in circumstances among those who had never known us. I thought I might get employment that would enable me to support my mother and sister in tolerable comfort. I did get a place with Tenney \u0026 Rhodes, but I only earned five dollars a week. Just before meeting you I lost that, and had you not come to our assistance I don\u0027t know what would have become of us.\" \"I feel repaid for whatever I have done for you,\" said Frank Sylvester, kindly. \"Has this Mr. Lorimer a family?\" \"He has a wife and one son.\" \"Were your families intimate?\" \"Yes. We occupied adjoining houses. Julian Lorimer was about my age, and [Pg 78]attended the same school. I never liked him, however. He had a very high opinion of himself, and put on airs which made him generally unpopular.\" \"Did he put on airs with you?\" \"Not till after the failure. My father moved out of his house, but Mr. Lorimer remained in his, and appeared to live in about the same style as before, while we moved into a few rooms in an unfashionable part of the city. After this Julian took very little notice of me.\" \"You haven\u0027t met him since you came to New York?\" \"No; I rather wonder I haven\u0027t, but I suppose I shall some day.\" The time came sooner than he anticipated. Rupert was crossing Eighth Avenue near Forty-second Street one day, when he came near being run into by a bicycle. The rider gave a note of warning, and then stopped short in surprise. \"Rupert Rollins!\" he said, in a half tone of inquiry. \"Is it you, Julian?\" asked Rupert, recognizing his former schoolmate. [Pg 79] \"Yes. Are you living in New York?\" \"Yes.\" \"Whereabouts?\" \"At present I am staying in Harlem.\" \"I heard you and your mother were living in a tenement house down town.\" \"My mother is not living in the city,\" returned Rupert, coldly. He did not care to give Julian any more information than was absolutely necessary. \"Where is she, then?\" \"In Rutherford, New Jersey.\" \"Why don\u0027t you live there, too?\" \"Because I expect to be employed in New York.\" \"Then you are out of work now?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why don\u0027t you live in the Newsboys\u0027 Lodge? That is cheap.\" \"Have you ever lived there?\" \"Do you mean to insult me? I live in a nice house on One Hundred and Sixteenth Street.\" \"So do I.\" \"You are bluffing.\" [Pg 80] \"Why should I? What good would it do me?\" Further inquiry developed the fact that they lived in neighboring blocks. \"I don\u0027t see how you can afford to live on such a street.\" \"I am at present visiting a friend—Mr. Sylvester.\" \"Is he rich?\" \"Yes. I believe so.\" \"I suppose you know that my father has a nice new store on Third Avenue, near Forty-second Street?\" \"I heard something of the kind,\" said Rupert, briefly. \"He\u0027s doing a staving business—a good deal larger than he did in Buffalo.\" Rupert made no comment. \"You said you were out of employment, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"You might call round at the store. Perhaps pa can find a place for you as a cash boy, though you would be rather large for that.\" \"How much does he pay his cash boys?\" [Pg 81] \"Two and a half a week.\" \"I hardly think I could live on that,\" said Rupert, smiling. \"It is better than being out of work.\" \"That is true, but I shouldn\u0027t like to be getting more and more behindhand every week. Are you attending school?\" \"Yes, but I think of going into business soon.\" \"Perhaps,\" suggested Rupert, \"you will take one of the cash boys\u0027 places.\" \"You must be crazy. When I go into business it won\u0027t be into a retail store. I will get a place in some wholesale establishment. There\u0027s a better chance to rise there.\" \"I didn\u0027t know but you would go to college.\" \"I am not very fond of study. Pa would send me to Columbia College or to Harvard, if I wanted to go, but I prefer a life of business. I want to become a merchant prince.\" \"It would certainly be agreeable. I shall be satisfied if I can be successful enough to support my mother and sister in comfort. That is my ambition.\" [Pg 82] \"Oh, I dare say. You are a poor boy, you know.\" \"Look here, Julian, there\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t understand. Your father and mine were partners, and I supposed in the same circumstances. Both failed together. Yet your father now has a large store of his own, and we are poor. Can you tell me why?\" \"I\u0027m not good at conundrums. I\u0027ll have to be going. If you want a place as cash boy I\u0027ll ask pa to fit you out. Ta ta!\" And Julian dashed off on his wheel. \"I hope some time to be a successful and honorable man of business,\" thought Rupert, as he followed his former schoolfellow with his glance. \"My ambition would not be satisfied with anything short of this.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82795.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
