{"id":16856,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. NEW PLANS.","content":"When Rupert entered the Somerset Hotel on his return from the West he received a cordial welcome from Mr. Malcolm, the clerk. \"I hope you have had a pleasant journey,\" he said. \"Very pleasant, on the whole.\" \"And do you want your old place again?\" \"No,\" answered Rupert. \"I hope to go into some other line of business.\" \"I\u0027m glad for one reason. I have taken a very good boy in your place—David Williams—and I would not like to discharge him.\" \"I hear Leslie has left you also.\" \"Yes. He has gone on the stage, I believe,\" said the clerk, smiling. \"Have you any plans in that direction?\" [Pg 348] \"No; I couldn\u0027t make as much as the wages you were paying me.\" \"I doubt if Leslie will find the change to his advantage.\" \"Whom have you in his place?\" \"A boy named Bernard Benton. He is also a good boy. By the way, a letter came for you yesterday. Here it is.\" Rupert supposed the letter might be from his mother, but on reading the address he found that it was in a business hand. He opened the envelope and read as follows. \"Mr. Rupert Rollins— \"Dear Sir: I learn that you are the owner of two lots on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, in Harlem. I should like to buy them, and am willing to pay you seven thousand dollars for the two. \"Yours truly, \"Albert Crossman.\" Rupert read the letter with mingled pleasure and surprise. The lots had cost but one thousand dollars each. That they should have increased in value to such an extent was hardly credible. He did not feel like deciding the matter[Pg 349] until he had a chance to consult with Mr. Packard, and he so wrote Mr. Crossman. Now that his mother had lost her position he felt that this stroke of good luck was particularly timely. He went out in the afternoon to see his mother and Grace. He found that Mr. Strathmore was dead, and that his funeral had taken place. \"I don\u0027t know what we shall do, Rupert,\" said Mrs. Rollins anxiously. \"It may be some time before I can obtain another position where I can support myself and Grace. However, I have saved seventy-five dollars, so that for a time I shall not be a burden upon you.\" \"Don\u0027t talk of being a burden, mother. You never can be that.\" \"But how can your small earnings support three persons?\" \"You forget, mother, that I have property.\" \"To what do you refer, Rupert?\" \"To the two lots Mr. Packard gave me.\" \"I had not supposed them of much value.\" \"I have an offer of seven thousand dollars for them.\" [Pg 350] \"Is it possible?\" asked Mrs. Rollins in amazement. \"It is quite possible. I don\u0027t think we are in any immediate danger of the poorhouse. When shall you be ready to come to New York?\" \"Whenever I have a home provided; but you remember that I sold my furniture when I accepted the position with Mr. Strathmore.\" \"I have already looked at a furnished flat on West Nineteenth Street. It is but twenty dollars a month, and will make you a pleasant home.\" \"But isn\u0027t that a high rent to pay?\" \"Not in our present circumstances. However, I will wait till Mr. Packard reaches the city, and consult with him. I expect him in a day or two.\" \"Will the proprietor of the Somerset Hotel receive you back as a bell-boy?\" \"He would, but I have declined the place.\" \"But you will have to do something, Rupert.\" Rupert smiled. \"Don\u0027t feel anxious, mother,\" he said, \"Mr.[Pg 351] Packard is a rich man, and he is a faithful friend. I think he will arrange something for me.\" The next day Mr. Packard and his uncle, John Plympton, reached New York and established themselves at the Somerset Hotel. Rupert learned with satisfaction of Mr. Plympton\u0027s recovery of his money from his knavish nephew. \"And now, Rupert,\" said the cattleman, \"tell me about your own affairs.\" \"First, I have received an offer of seven thousand dollars for the two lots you gave me.\" \"That is fine. They have gone up surprisingly.\" \"Would you advise me to sell them?\" \"Yes. Sell them and invest half the money in other lots less desirably situated. It is only a question of time when they, too, can be sold to advantage.\" \"And the other half of the money?\" \"Invest in good bank stock or Government bonds, where they will yield an income.\" \"I am sure that is good advice.\" \"How about your mother?\" [Pg 352] \"The gentleman for whom she acted as housekeeper is dead, and she must seek a new home. I have looked at a furnished flat in West Nineteenth Street, renting at twenty dollars a month.\" \"I have another plan to propose. I have got tired of living in Colorado, though I shall retain my business interests there. I want to have a home for my uncle and myself here. I shall hire a moderate-sized house, and run it myself, and engage your mother to take charge of it, if she should be willing.\" \"Nothing would please her better, Mr. Packard,\" said Rupert, earnestly. \"As it may take me a little time to make the necessary arrangements, send for your mother and let her make a temporary home at this hotel. I will defray the expenses.\" \"You are very kind, Mr. Packard.\" \"Well, who has a better right? I have a great mind to adopt you, young man.\" \"I shan\u0027t make any violent opposition, Mr. Packard. But what will your nephew in Rochester say?\" \"Of course Eben won\u0027t like it, but I claim[Pg 353] a right to do what I like with my own. I shall not disinherit his family wholly, but what I leave to them will be so tied up that Eben can\u0027t get at it. It is amusing, the change that came over him when he learned that I was not a destitute cowboy, but a man of property.\" The next day Mrs. Rollins was installed at the hotel, and Mr. Packard began to look around for a house such as he desired. \"There shall be a nice room for you, Uncle John,\" he said. \"I will promise to treat you as well as Eben did.\" \"I can pay for my board, Giles. I don\u0027t want to cost you too much.\" \"You will pay for your board when I send in a bill. Don\u0027t trouble yourself till then.\" \"But I am able to work, Giles.\" \"I may find some light work for you, Uncle John, just to keep you from being uneasy.\" Mr. Packard was a man of promptness and energy. He visited a real estate agent, and soon made choice of a medium-sized house in a good neighborhood. This he furnished[Pg 354] plainly and quickly, for there is no need of delay where means are abundant. Inside of a month the little family were comfortably established in their new home. \"Will there be room for Fred, my little ward?\" asked Rupert. \"Certainly. It will be pleasant to have a young child in the house.\" Rupert had one apprehension. He feared that his friends, the Bentons, would miss the sum he paid for the little boy\u0027s board. But Mrs. Benton set him at ease. \"An old schoolmate of my husband, who is in a business position on Pearl Street, would like to board with us,\" she said, \"and is able and willing to pay a liberal sum. I feared at first that he would not be satisfied with our modest quarters, but he says he wants a home, not a stylish boarding-house, so he will be content.\" \"Then you won\u0027t be inconvenienced by losing Fred\u0027s board?\" \"No, but we shall miss the dear child\u0027s company. You must let him come to see us sometimes.\" \"Certainly I will, and we shall always be glad to see you as a visitor. Does Mr. Benton still find his place on Grand Street agreeable and satisfactory?\" \"Yes. He seems to stand high in the estimation of his employer.\" Little Fred at first was sorry to leave Mrs. Benton, but soon formed an attachment for Mrs. Rollins and Grace. \"Since he is your adopted son, Rupert,\" said his mother, \"I suppose I may look upon him as my grandson.\" \"By adoption, mother,\" said Rupert, with a smile. \"Now, Mr. Packard, what do you advise me to do?\" asked Rupert. \"Spend at least six months in study. Go to some commercial college, and when you have completed your course of instruction I shall be ready with some plan for you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82826.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
