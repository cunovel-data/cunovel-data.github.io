{"id":16840,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. A BAFFLED SCHEME.","content":"Both Julian Lorimer and his father felt mortified at the failure of their attempt to humiliate Mr. Benton. They had supposed he had neither friends nor influence and were very much surprised at his securing another position elsewhere at an advanced salary. They tried to find out where he was now employed, but without success. Julian inquired of Rupert one day when he met him, but the bell-boy refused to tell. \"Oh, it\u0027s a secret, is it?\" sneered Julian. \"Yes, to you,\" answered Rupert. \"Why did you wish to know?\" Rupert was confident that Julian meant mischief, and in the interest of Mr. Benton he declined to give him any information. Of course this made Julian all the more anxious to gain his point. He got in the way[Pg 216] of visiting every dry-goods store, and scanning the clerks and salesmen. But there are a good many such stores in New York, and it was some time before he made any discovery. One day, however, he strayed into Grand Street, and entered a large store in quest of some cheap neckties which he saw exposed outside. Julian was rather a dude, and these ties had attracted his notice. As he was passing through the store without any special thought of his father\u0027s old clerk, he chanced to pass by the counter where dress goods were sold. His face lighted up with malicious joy when he saw Benton measuring off a dress pattern for a lady. He stopped until the salesman was at leisure. Then, stepping up to the counter, he said, \"Good morning, Mr. Benton.\" Benton certainly was not pleased to see his old persecutor. Perhaps his countenance expressed his feelings as he answered, \"Good morning, Julian.\" \"So it is here you are employed?\" \"Yes, as you see.\" [Pg 217] \"Did you come here directly from pa\u0027s store?\" \"Yes. How did you find out that I was here?\" \"I didn\u0027t find out till just now.\" \"Can I do anything for you? Do you wish to buy anything in my line?\" \"No. I came in for some neckties. Do you ever see anything of Rupert Rollins?\" \"Yes, he has a room at my house.\" \"Oho, I didn\u0027t know that. That accounts for his interest in you.\" \"I am glad he has an interest in me. He is a very good friend of mine.\" \"A poor boy like him isn\u0027t much of a friend. He can\u0027t do much for you.\" \"He got me this position.\" \"Did he?\" said Julian, in some surprise. \"Yes.\" Benton might have told Julian that Rupert owned two valuable lots in Harlem, but he thought it more proper that Rupert himself should make it known whenever he saw fit. \"Well, so long. I may see you again before long.\" [Pg 218] \"I am not in the least desirous of it,\" thought Benton, but he answered civilly. \"Well, pa,\" said Julian, at dinner, \"I saw your old clerk, Benton, to-day.\" \"Did you, indeed,\" said Mr. Lorimer, interested. \"Is he out of work?\" \"No; he\u0027s employed in a Grand Street store.\" \"Did you speak to him?\" \"Yes.\" \"How did he appear?\" \"He was better dressed than when he worked for you.\" \"I mean was he cordial?\" \"Not very. I don\u0027t think he was very glad to see me. Good reason why.\" \"I wonder whether he is well paid?\" \"I didn\u0027t ask him, for I knew he wouldn\u0027t tell me if I did. I have no doubt he gets a good deal more than what you paid him.\" \"They must have taken him without a recommendation,\" mused Lorimer. \"You wouldn\u0027t give him a recommendation, would you?\" \"No, I should have to say that he was insubordinate and gave me trouble.\" [Pg 219] Julian Lorimer could be depended upon to act meanly and maliciously, without any scruples of conscience. Two days later Mr. Benton was summoned to the superintendent\u0027s room. \"You wished to see me, sir?\" he said. \"Yes. I wish to show you a letter which the firm has received.\" Henry Benton took the proffered letter, and read with what feelings can be imagined the following communication: \"Gentlemen— \"In visiting your store yesterday I saw a Mr. Benton behind the dress goods counter who used to work in our, that is, my father\u0027s store. I was surprised that you should employ him. He brought no recommendation from us, or if he presented one it was forged. My father found him unsatisfactory, and was quite glad to get rid of him. He is a poor man, and I don\u0027t want to injure him, but I thought it only right that I should tell you what my father thinks of him. He would not tell us where he was going, and it was only by chance that I found out. Yours truly, \"Julian Lorimer.\" \"Well, Mr. Wilson, I have read the letter,\"[Pg 220] said Benton. \"Is there anything you would like to ask me in reference to it?\" \"Is the writer correct in his statements?\" \"So far from it that his father asked me to stay longer, and offered me an additional dollar a week.\" \"Did you have any trouble when in Mr. Lorimer\u0027s store?\" \"Yes; this boy Julian, who has nothing to do with the business, interfered with my work and was very insolent. I rebuked him and he succeeded in getting his father to discharge me. Afterward his father revoked the dismissal and wished me to stay. But I had already a situation offered me here, and I declined. I hope this letter will not prejudice you against me.\" \"By no means. Even without your explanation I understood pretty well the character of the writer of the note.\" \"Shall you answer it?\" \"Yes; I have a curiosity to see the boy.\" Julian Lorimer smiled with satisfaction when he received a letter inviting him to call at the Grand Street store. [Pg 221] \"Things are working as I desired,\" he said to himself. \"I think, Mr. Benton, your career will be brief, and you will soon be looking for another position.\" He entered the store about ten o\u0027clock, and took good care to walk by the counter behind which Mr. Benton was employed. The latter saw him, but after his interview with the superintendent he did not feel anxious. \"I am Julian Lorimer,\" announced Julian, as he entered the presence of the superintendent. \"You wrote us a letter, I believe?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"In relation to a clerk in our employ?\" \"Yes. Mr. Benton.\" \"He used to work for your father?\" \"Yes, sir. He was in father\u0027s employ rather more than a year.\" \"He stayed some time, then?\" \"Yes; father didn\u0027t want to discharge him as he had a family.\" \"Very considerate on your father\u0027s part, certainly,\" said Mr. Wilson, in a peculiar tone, in which Julian did not detect the sarcasm. [Pg 222] \"On the whole, your father did not find him satisfactory? What was the matter? Isn\u0027t he a good salesman?\" \"Pretty fair,\" answered Julian. \"Nothing alarming.\" \"Then what fault did he find with him? I suppose he was honest?\" \"Yes, so far as we know.\" \"And still your father found him unsatisfactory. There must have been some cause of complaint?\" \"He was impudent,\" said Julian. \"He felt too large for his position.\" \"Was he impudent to your father?\" \"No.\" \"To whom, then?\" \"To me.\" \"Oh, to you. Were you employed in the store?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Then I don\u0027t see how you could have come in contact with him.\" \"I used to go into the store sometimes. That was very natural, as it was my father\u0027s store.\" [Pg 223] \"And on one of these occasions he was impudent to you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"This is a serious charge. What would you advise me to do? Do you think I ought to discharge him?\" \"I will only say this, that my father would not have him in the store.\" \"You said in your letter that you did not wish to injure him. If he should be discharged that would certainly be an injury.\" \"Yes, sir, I suppose so,\" answered Julian, with hesitation. He was puzzled and could not understand what Mr. Wilson was driving at. \"I will send for Mr. Benton.\" When Benton came into the presence of the superintendent, Mr. Wilson said, \"Mr. Benton, this boy, Mr. Julian Lorimer, has been bringing charges against you.\" \"I am not surprised to hear it, sir.\" \"He says you did not treat him respectfully when you were in his father\u0027s store; that, in short, you were impudent to him.\" \"There is some truth in my not treating[Pg 224] him respectfully. He came up to my counter and interfered with my work.\" \"You were aware that he was Mr. Lorimer\u0027s son?\" \"Oh, yes, sir.\" \"And yet you rebuked or snubbed him?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"He thinks that a serious matter. He thinks I ought to discharge you. My own feeling is that you treated him just right.\" Julian looked paralyzed. \"And to make up to you for his malicious attempt to injure you, I will raise your salary two dollars a week.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"As for you, young man, I don\u0027t wish to see you in the store again. James, you may show Mr. Lorimer out.\" Julian lost no time in getting out of the place. He had never felt so humiliated before. It would be hard to describe his blended rage and mortification. It was certainly aggravating to reflect that he had only succeeded in raising Mr. Benton\u0027s salary.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82810.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
