{"id":16841,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. LESLIE\u0027S PROGRESS.","content":"Leslie Waters obtained the situation of bell-boy through Rupert\u0027s recommendation, and entered upon his duties at once. He had failed in his ambition to become an actor. With his elevated ideas of the position of a member of the profession, he did not immediately become reconciled to figuring as a bell-boy, but it enabled him to live in the great city, which became daily more and more attractive to him. Rupert engaged for him a small hall bedroom in the same house in which he was himself living. The price agreed upon was only a dollar and a half weekly, which, with his salary, he could pay without inconvenience. Rupert was afraid that Leslie would prove too flighty and impracticable for his humble duties, but was agreeably disappointed. Accustomed to work on a farm in a quiet country[Pg 226] town, Leslie found hotel life very attractive, and labored zealously to give satisfaction. The day after he went to work he wrote to his father in Rahway as follows: \"Dear Father— \"I hope you are not angry at my leaving home so suddenly. I had got tired of country life, and felt that I was destined to a career in the city. I was not sure what employment awaited me, but hoped in some way to make a living. I have succeeded—I have secured a position in the Somerset Hotel, on Broadway. I take my meals at the hotel, and am paid a salary of five dollars per week besides. I have to pay a dollar and a half for a room, and the balance of my pay will defray the rest of my expenses. \"I owe my success to a very friendly boy, not quite as old as I am, who is employed in the hotel. My hours are from six to six, so that I have my evenings to myself. I think you will agree that I am doing better and earning more than I ever did in Rahway. Of course I hope to be promoted, perhaps to go into some more congenial business when I get better acquainted in the city. If you should come to the city at any time I shall be glad to have you call at the hotel. \"Your son, \"Leslie Waters.\" [Pg 227] In reply, Leslie received the following letter, written in a cramped hand, indicating that the writer was not accustomed to epistolary composition: \"Son Leslie— \"I have received your letter, and am glad to learn that you are not quite so foolish as I supposed. I was afraid you had the foolish notion of becoming a play actor. I never knew one in that profession who was a solid, sensible man. To my mind it is a very poor business. It is all very well for boys to speak pieces at school exhibitions, but when they start in to speak pieces for a livelihood it is very foolish. I surmised from some things I had observed in you that you had such a notion in your head, but I am glad I was mistaken. \"The hotel business is a good business, I am told. You don\u0027t tell me what your duties are, but you seem to be earning pretty good pay. I hope you will give satisfaction. You never earned even three dollars a week at farming, so that perhaps it may be well for you to stay where you are really earning a good income. Some time you may be qualified to keep a hotel yourself. Your mother\u0027s cousin keeps a hotel somewhere in Kansas, and I hear that he is making money. You did wrong to leave home without permission, but I will not find fault with you under the circumstances. When I go to New York I will[Pg 228] call in and see how you are getting along. Your mother will make up a bundle of clothing and send you by express. \"Your father, \"Jethro Waters.\" Leslie showed this letter to Rupert. \"Your father doesn\u0027t suspect that you came to the city intending to go on the stage?\" he said. \"No, he thinks I have given up my ambition to become an actor. He has no idea what a glorious profession it is. I don\u0027t suppose he ever went to the theatre in his life. I wish he could see Edwin Booth, or Irving, or Joseph Jefferson. Yet I suppose he would rather have me keep a hotel than become as great as either of these.\" \"It takes a smart man to keep a hotel, Leslie. Very likely Booth or Irving wouldn\u0027t succeed in that line.\" \"I hope some time I may get a chance on the stage. Will you go with me to-night to see Mansfield in \u0027Jekyll and Hyde\u0027?\" \"Yes; I have no other engagement.\" That evening the two bell-boys had front[Pg 229] seats in the gallery of a Broadway theatre, and saw Mr. Mansfield in his remarkable impersonation of the two contrasted characters. Leslie was filled with admiration. \"Do you know, Rupert, I think I will learn to act those parts in time?\" \"You might succeed in Jekyll, but it would be more difficult to play the part of Hyde.\" \"Perhaps so. Indeed, I know you are right. But it is a part which I should enjoy. I have a great mind to make a study of it.\" \"If I were you I would try something easier.\" \"It is the hard parts that are best worth acting,\" said Leslie, grandly. Rupert thought little more of this conversation, but two evenings later, as he sat playing checkers with Harry Benton, there was a knock at the door of Mrs. Benton\u0027s apartment. On the door being opened, Mrs. Spenser appeared. She was the lady of whom Leslie hired his room. She seemed to be quite excited. \"Oh, Mr. Rollins,\" she exclaimed, addressing Rupert, \"I wanted to see you. I am so frightened.\" [Pg 230] Rupert looked up in surprise. \"What is the matter, Mrs. Spenser?\" \"Your friend, Mr. Waters, is making a terrible noise. Is he subject to fits?\" \"Not that I ever heard.\" \"I don\u0027t dare to go in. He is acting like a wild man. I never heard anything to equal it. Do you know if any of his family were ever crazy?\" \"I will go and see what is the matter. I don\u0027t think you need be alarmed.\" \"If he is really crazy,\" continued Mrs. Spenser, \"I don\u0027t think I can keep him, though I need the money he pays for room rent.\" Rupert abandoned his game, and, accompanied by the frightened woman, proceeded to the part of the house where Leslie lodged. As he stood outside in the hall he heard Leslie in a low, guttural voice rehearsing the part of Hyde. One who was not familiar with the r?le or the play might be excused for being startled. Rupert tried the door, and entered. There was his associate bell-boy, [Pg 231]half-crouching, and with his black hair carefully disordered, walking across the room, with his naturally pleasant face distorted by a grin as fiendish as he could make it. \"Look at him! He is certainly crazy!\" ejaculated the terrified landlady. \"He looks awful.\" \"What are you doing, Leslie?\" asked Rupert. Leslie looked up, and his face showed embarrassment when he saw his visitors. \"I am practicing the part of Hyde,\" he said. \"I thought so. You have frightened Mrs. Spenser, who thought you had a fit or were crazy.\" Instead of being offended, Leslie took this as a tribute to his art. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is a frightful character. Did I really look dreadful?\" \"Awful!\" said Mrs. Spenser. \"That\u0027s the way Mansfield looked. Isn\u0027t it, Rupert?\" \"Something like it, Leslie, but I shouldn\u0027t think you would like to imitate such a personation. Why don\u0027t you try Romeo?\" [Pg 232] \"Romeo is a silly character. He is only a sixteenth century dude.\" \"Then imitate Claude Melnotte, in the \u0027Lady of Lyons.\u0027\" \"I never saw it.\" \"In that character, instead of looking frightful, you would need to look handsome, romantic and attractive. If Mrs. Spenser should see you in that she wouldn\u0027t be frightened.\" \"Are you an actor, Mr. Waters?\" asked the landlady, curiously. \"I hope to be some day,\" returned Leslie, much flattered. \"I am going to have some friends come in to see me Christmas evening. I should be very much obliged if you would do some acting for us, only not that Hyde,\" and she shuddered. \"I shall be pleased to do what I can, Mrs. Spenser,\" replied Leslie, graciously. \"I will speak some pieces for you—some pieces that require acting. I have a recitation called \u0027The Tramp.\u0027\" \"I shall be very glad to have you. It will[Pg 233] be a great favor. Don\u0027t you act, too, Mr. Rollins?\" \"No; I leave all that to my friend Leslie.\" The landlady retired, leaving the two boys alone. \"What did you think of my acting, Rupert?\" said Leslie. \"If I could see it again I think it would give me a nightmare.\" \"I consider that a compliment,\" said Leslie, complacently. \"I shall never be satisfied, Rupert, till I go on the stage.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82811.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
