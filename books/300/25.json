{"id":16842,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. LESLIE WATERS AS A DRAMATIC STAR.","content":"A year passed; not an eventful year, however, nor did it materially change the position of the principal characters introduced in our story. Rupert was still a bell-boy in the Somerset Hotel. He had been raised three dollars a week, however, and was now receiving a salary of eight dollars, besides his board. His friend Leslie Waters was doing satisfactory service at six dollars. He had by no means lost his love for the stage. He economized on clothing in order to attend the theatre. It must be said that his taste was good, and that he preferred standard plays and good acting to the sensational pieces that too often eclipse in success the better class of dramas. He had joined the Violet Dramatic Club of young men, meeting weekly somewhere on West Fourteenth Street. The members of the[Pg 235] club laboriously rehearsed short plays, and offered their services gratuitously, or for a slight compensation, to charitable societies, and thus obtained some valuable training and a share of applause. Of course Leslie Waters was always cast for a prominent part. Of all the members of the society he was the most ambitious, and the most willing to work. For a long time he tried to induce his fellow-members to essay a long play. He was particularly desirous of playing Claude Melnotte, in the \"Lady of Lyons.\" The main difficulty, however, was in obtaining a young lady capable of playing Pauline. At length that difficulty was surmounted. A young lady of eighteen, from Brooklyn, the cousin of one of the members of the club, who, like Leslie, thought herself born for the stage, offered her services, and was adjudged competent, although rather disposed to overdo the part. One day Leslie brought to his friend Rupert a circular to the following effect: [Pg 236] \"The Violet Dramatic Club beg leave to inform their friends and the public generally that they will produce Bulwer\u0027s noted play, The Lady of Lyons, At Amaranth Hall, on First Avenue, on the evening of Thursday, May 6, with the distinguished actor, Leslie Waters, in the character of Claude Melnotte. Miss Ida Strassburger, an accomplished amateur from Brooklyn, will appear as Pauline. \"Tickets, 25 and 50 cents.\" \"The proceeds will be given to the Society for the Relief of Indigent Laundresses.\" \"What do you think of that, Rupert?\" asked Leslie, with a complacent smile. \"I congratulate you on your opportunity to make a hit. I am glad it is you, and not I, who is to play the part of Claude.\" \"Of course you would hardly be competent. If you would like some light part, like that of a servant, I think I might have got you into the cast.\" \"Thank you, Leslie, but I have no ambition in that direction. Who is the Pauline? Do you know her?\" \"It is Ida Strassburger, of Brooklyn. She is a cousin of one of our members.\" [Pg 237] \"How does she play?\" \"Pretty well, but she has something of the Bowery style; that is, she rather overdoes her part. I have tried to tone her down.\" \"Does she look the part?\" \"Well, no. I am sorry to say it, but she is rather short and fat. She is German, as you may guess from her name. Still I think she will do, if she will be guided by me. You see we can\u0027t afford to be too particular about a Pauline, for it is harder to get actresses than actors.\" \"Do you feel at all nervous about your first appearance in a star part?\" \"Oh, no, I never was troubled with stage fright. I have considerable confidence in myself.\" This was quite true. Had Leslie been requested to appear as Hamlet, he would have had no misgivings, but with sufficient time for preparation would have walked on the stage prepared to enact the r?le of the melancholy Dane. \"I hope you will win the popular favor, and get your name before the public.\" [Pg 238] \"I hope so. One of our members, who sometimes reports for the Evening News, has promised to write an account for that paper, and we hope to be noticed by the Sun and World.\" \"Suppose your father reads the account? Does he take either of these papers?\" \"I hope he will. In fact I shall make sure that he does, for I will send the papers to him marked, getting you to address the wrappers. While he would object to my going on the stage professionally, I don\u0027t think he will mind my appearing for the benefit of a charitable society.\" \"Do you know anything about the Society for the Relief of Indigent Laundresses?\" \"No.\" \"Yet you are going to work very hard for them.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t care anything for the society. I would be willing to work for any society, as long as I got a chance to appear in a prominent part.\" \"I am not sure,\" said Rupert, laughing, \"but I would like to have your club give a[Pg 239] performance for the benefit of destitute bell-boys.\" \"I am quite ready, if any such society should be formed.\" \"I\u0027ll think about forming one, though I am glad to say I don\u0027t know of any destitute bell-boys at present.\" Rupert bought several tickets, and invited the entire Benton family, including his young charge, to attend the performance. Mrs. Spenser and her daughters received an invitation from Leslie Waters himself. The widow felt quite flattered. \"I am sure, Mr. Waters,\" she said, \"I am proud to think a distinguished actor like you is a lodger of mine. It will seem so odd to see you on the stage. I don\u0027t see how you can do it.\" \"It comes natural to me, Mrs. Spenser,\" said Leslie, much flattered. \"And do you think you will ever go on the stage as a regular business, Mr. Waters?\" \"I will if I have a good opportunity. To be a bell-boy does not satisfy my ambition.\" \"It is a good, steady business.\" [Pg 240] \"Yes, but I feel that I was born for higher things. Anyone can be a bell-boy, but there are few who are qualified to become actors.\" \"I wonder your friend Mr. Rollins doesn\u0027t act.\" \"Well, you see, Rupert is a very good fellow, but I don\u0027t think he is gifted enough to become an actor, that is, a prominent actor. I offered to get him the part of a servant, but he didn\u0027t care to attempt it. Some time, Mrs. Spenser, when a child is needed in any of my plays, I may get the chance for your Sophie.\" \"Oh, Mr. Waters, how kind you are. Do you really think Sophie could act?\" \"Yes, if I should train her. You know not very much is expected of a child.\" \"I should feel so proud to see my little girl on the stage. Did you ever see Elsie Leslie act?\" \"Yes, she is very clever. I only wish she were old enough, and would consent to take the part of Pauline. She would be far better than Ida Strassburger.\" \"Is she pretty?\" \"She is fair-looking, but she is too fat.[Pg 241] However, she has a lover, a stout, young German, who, I understand, is jealous because on the stage I am to personate her lover. I presume he will be present. I will harrow him up by being a little extra affectionate.\" \"Now, Mr. Waters, you are really too bad. You ought to consider the feelings of the poor young man.\" \"His name is Otto Schaefer, and he is a butcher\u0027s assistant, I understand. I really hope he won\u0027t bring a butcher knife with him, for it might prove serious for me.\" \"Rupert,\" said Leslie in a mysterious tone, a few hours before the play, \"I will tell you a secret if you won\u0027t breathe a word about it.\" \"Is it that you are engaged to the fair Pauline?\" \"Oh, bother, no. Otto Schaefer may have her, if he wishes.\" \"What is it, then?\" \"I have sent complimentary tickets to Palmer and Daly. Do you think they will come?\" \"I imagine they are both very busy men, and cannot afford the time.\" [Pg 242] \"I thought, if they should be impressed with my playing, one of them might offer me an engagement in his stock company.\" \"And you would like that?\" \"Would I like it? It would make me supremely happy.\" \"Then you are not satisfied with the position of a bell-boy?\" \"Certainly not. Are you?\" \"For the present, yes.\" \"Should you be willing to be a bell-boy for the next twenty years?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think I should, but I am still very young. I have just passed seventeen.\" \"And I am a year older. It is high time I entered upon my chosen vocation.\" At length the eventful evening arrived. The hall was well filled, but the audience were from the neighborhood of First Avenue and Avenue A. Many of them were German or of German descent. The fact that Miss Strassburger, who was to play Pauline, was of Teutonic blood, doubtless accounted for this fact. The play commenced and progressed[Pg 243] smoothly. The actors were well up in their parts. Ida Strassburger, to be sure, hardly looked aristocratic enough for Pauline, her figure being decidedly dumpy. She assumed a coquettish air, and from time to time glanced from the corner of her eye at a short, stout German young man who sat but a few feet from the stage. It is needless to say that this was Otto Schaefer, her Brooklyn lover. He seemed restless and ill at ease, especially when there were any affectionate passages between Ida and Leslie. For instance, when Pauline has to say, \"Sweet prince, tell me again of thy palace by the Lake of Como; it is so pleasant to hear of thy splendors since thou didst swear to me that they would be desolate without Pauline,\" Otto\u0027s lip curled with scorn, and he glared at the prince with a hostile eye. Towards the end of the play, when Melnotte presents himself after a long absence, and Pauline, recognizing her husband, rushes into his arms, Otto could stand it no longer. He sprang from his seat, jumped on the stage, and called out in an excited tone to Leslie:[Pg 244] \"You quit that! That gal is my promised wife.\" Instantly there was a chorus of exclamations, and half the audience rose to their feet in excitement. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82812.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
