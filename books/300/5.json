{"id":16822,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. MRS. MARLOW\u0027S SCHEME.","content":"Mrs. Marlow was of a covetous disposition, and not overburdened with principle. When she saw Mrs. Rollins drop a purse into her bureau drawer, she immediately began to consider how she could manage to appropriate it. It was necessary to get into the room when the widow was out, but unfortunately for her plans, Mrs. Rollins seldom left her daughter. \"Why can\u0027t she go out and get a bit of amusement like other folks?\" she muttered. Presently Mrs. Marlow had a bright idea. If the widow could suspect that some accident had happened to Rupert her absence could be secured. She made her way to a district messenger office, and wrote a message announcing that Rupert had been run over and had his leg broken. [Pg 43] Then she went home and waited for the success of her stratagem. Opening her door, she soon saw the young messenger ascend the stairs. \"Where does Mrs. Rollins live?\" he asked. \"On the next floor,\" she answered, smiling with satisfaction. Soon—almost immediately—Mrs. Rollins came down stairs in a terrible state of anxiety. She scarcely noticed Mrs. Marlow, who was watching her through the open door of her room, but hurried on her sad errand. \"Now\u0027s my chance!\" thought Mrs. Marlow. \"I hope the brat\u0027s asleep.\" She crept softly up stairs and stealthily opened the door of her neighbor\u0027s room without knocking. Once in the room, she looked cautiously toward the bed. Grace had her face turned toward the wall and was in a light slumber. \"Heaven be praised!\" thought Mrs. Marlow. She walked on tiptoe to the bureau and opened the upper drawer. There was the purse! Mrs. Rollins had gone out in such a hurry that she had not thought to take it. [Pg 44] Mrs. Marlow took it hurriedly and dropped it into her capacious pocket. Before she could leave the room Grace woke, and turning her head saw her. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mrs. Marlow? Why are you here?\" she asked, in a startled voice. \"Drat the child!\" muttered Mrs. Marlow, under her breath. Then aloud, \"I thought you was asleep, my dear, and I didn\u0027t want to disturb you.\" \"But why are you here? Where is my mother?\" \"She went out in a hurry like as if she had heard bad news. I saw her go out, and thought you might want something. So I came up, but I didn\u0027t want to disturb you.\" Grace was surprised. It was not like Mrs. Marlow to be so thoughtful and considerate. \"No,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t want anything—except my mother.\" \"She won\u0027t be gone long, my dear.\" \"Did she say anything to you when she went out?\" \"No; but I saw a telegraph boy come [Pg 45]upstairs with a message like, and she went out directly afterwards.\" \"I wish I knew what she went out for.\" \"You\u0027ll know soon. I must hurry back now, for my kettle will be bilin\u0027.\" Once in her own room Mrs. Marlow opened the purse, after she had locked the door. Her delight at discovering the gold piece was great. \"And it\u0027s a gold piece you\u0027ve got, Mrs. Rollins!\" she exclaimed. \"Sure you\u0027re in luck, Maggie Marlow, for once in your life. It\u0027s ten dollars, as sure as you live. And I might be passin\u0027 it off for a quarter. I\u0027ll have to get it changed quick.\" Mrs. Rollins had taken a dollar in silver, but there was a dollar and a half left besides the gold piece. After she got into her own room it occurred to her that she might have hunted up the basket of provisions and helped herself from what was left. \"But it don\u0027t matter,\" she reflected. \"With all this money I can buy what I like.\" She put on her bonnet and shawl, and[Pg 46] going down stairs went to the nearest grocery store. \"What can I do for you, Mrs. Marlow?\" asked the grocer. \"You may give me a pound of tea, a pound of butter, a pound of sugar and a loaf of bread,\" answered Mrs. Marlow, volubly. \"Are you sure you\u0027ve got money enough to pay for them?\" asked the grocer, doubtfully. \"Yes, and more, too.\" Upon this assurance the articles were put up, and Mrs. Marlow passed over the gold eagle. \"A ten-dollar gold piece!\" exclaimed the grocer, in surprise. \"And where did you get so much money? Have you come into a fortune?\" \"Sure it was given me by a cousin of my husband—he\u0027s a rich man, and lives uptown. It isn\u0027t often he thinks of me, but he opened his heart this time.\" This explanation seemed plausible, and the grocer gave Mrs. Marlow her change—about nine dollars. [Pg 47] \"I\u0027m glad you are so lucky,\" he remarked. \"I shall be glad to have you come again—as long as the money lasts,\" he added, with a laugh. \"Sure I made a good excuse. He\u0027ll never mistrust,\" said Mrs. Marlow to herself, as she went back to her room. \"Now, Mrs. Rollins, you may come back as soon as you like.\" Mrs. Rollins was away three hours. She visited the locality mentioned in the note she had received, but could hear nothing of a boy being run over by the cars and having his leg broken. She went into a drug store, but neither the druggist nor his clerks had heard of any such accident. \"Where can they have taken my boy?\" she moaned. \"If I could only find him, and have him brought home!\" There seemed to be absolutely no clew. After a while she bethought her of the sick girl she had left behind. \"If Grace wakes up she won\u0027t know what has become of me, and will feel frightened. I ought to have told her, or left word with Mrs. Marlow.\" [Pg 48] Weary and disheartened, she went home and toiled up the stairs to her own room. \"Where have you been, mother?\" asked Grace, anxiously, \"and what did you go out for?\" Mrs. Rollins sank into a chair, and could not answer at first for very weariness. \"What message did the telegraph boy bring you, mother?\" \"What do you know about the telegraph boy, Grace? Were you awake when I went out?\" \"No, mother. Mrs. Marlow told me.\" \"She told you about a telegraph boy calling on me?\" \"Yes. I waked up and saw her in the room. She said you had gone out, and she thought the telegraph boy had brought you bad news.\" \"So he did, Grace,\" said the widow, and she burst into tears. \"What is it, mother? Anything about Rupert?\" \"Yes. Your poor brother has been run over by the cars and got his leg broken.\" [Pg 49] \"Did you see him? Where is he?\" asked Grace, anxiously. \"No. I couldn\u0027t find him. I went to where the note mentioned, but could not hear anything about him.\" \"Perhaps he was taken to some hospital.\" \"Yes, I didn\u0027t think of that. I am sure he will send me a message as soon as he gets a chance. I wish I knew where he is.\" Mrs. Marlow was aware that the widow had returned, but hesitated about going upstairs. She was afraid some questions might be asked that would involve her in trouble. Besides, Mrs. Rollins might discover the loss of the purse, and the evidence of Grace might expose her to suspicion. \"Drat the child? I wish she hadn\u0027t waked up. Then I could deny that I had been in the room at all.\" But Mrs. Rollins did not have occasion to go to the bureau. She was absorbed in thoughts of Rupert. She did not know what course to take to get further knowledge of him. It seemed hard, but she could think of nothing except to wait for some message from him. [Pg 50] All at once she heard a familiar step on the stairs. \"It sounds like Rupert,\" said Grace, half-rising from the bed in her eagerness. Mrs. Rollins rose and hurried to the door. She reached it just as Rupert opened it and dashed into the room. \"Oh, Rupert!\" exclaimed the mother, joyfully. \"Then your leg isn\u0027t broken?\" \"I should say not. I should like to settle with the one that told you so. Tell me all about it, mother.\" \"So it was a telegraph boy who brought the message?\" he said, thoughtfully, after the explanation. \"Yes.\" \"Let me see the message.\" Rupert examined it, but the handwriting was not one that he was familiar with. \"Give it to me, mother. I\u0027ll find out the office it came from, and perhaps in that way I can get some light on the mystery.\" \"I don\u0027t see what object anyone could have in playing such a cruel trick on me,\" said the widow. \"Thank heaven, it isn\u0027t true.\" [Pg 51] Rupert took the note and went to the nearest messenger office. \"Was any messenger boy sent from here this afternoon to Elizabeth Street?\" The superintendent looked over the books. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Can you tell who left the message?\" \"It was a stout woman, of medium height.\" \"What did she wear?\" \"She had on a faded shawl. I don\u0027t remember what kind of a hat she wore.\" But a light had already dawned on Rupert. \"It was Mrs. Marlow!\" he said to himself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82792.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
