{"id":16839,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. TRYING TO BE AN ACTOR.","content":"\"Have you inquired for work?\" asked Rupert. \"Yes.\" \"What kind of work?\" \"I wanted to be an actor. So I applied at Palmer\u0027s Theatre and Daly\u0027s this forenoon, and this afternoon I went to others.\" \"How were you received?\" asked Rupert, in considerable curiosity. \"They wouldn\u0027t talk with me,\" answered Leslie, indignantly. \"One of the managers laughed at me when I asked if he would let me speak a piece, so that he might judge of my ability.\" \"Perhaps they had no vacancy,\" suggested Rupert, trying to keep his countenance. \"They asked me if I had ever acted. Of course I can\u0027t till I get the chance. I told him[Pg 206] I would be willing to work for five dollars a week till I got some experience. I told them they might try me in small parts. One of them asked me if I had ever played Hamlet. He must have been in fun.\" \"I should think so.\" \"Of course great actors like Booth must have served an apprenticeship. I was reading an account of Booth\u0027s early life lately, and he began just as I want to begin.\" \"I expect the profession must be crowded. There was an actor staying at the hotel last week. He is out of employment, and I think he must be out of funds, for he got me to go out and pawn an overcoat for him.\" \"I am sure I could succeed if I only had a show,\" continued Leslie. \"You don\u0027t happen to know any manager, do you?\" \"No. Perhaps you would stand a better chance of getting into a variety theatre. Can you sing or dance?\" \"No; I should not be willing to. I don\u0027t think Booth ever did, or Irving, or Forrest.\" \"No. I don\u0027t think they did.\" \"And I\u0027ll get some time to be a famous[Pg 207] actor, so I wouldn\u0027t like to have it mentioned in my biographies that I ever played in a variety theatre.\" \"Are you going to make any more applications, Leslie?\" \"I shall apply to every manager in the city,\" answered Leslie, energetically. \"I like your pluck. You deserve to succeed.\" \"Didn\u0027t you ever think of being an actor?\" \"No; I don\u0027t think I have any talent for it.\" \"Don\u0027t you like to speak pieces?\" \"Pretty well, but I like to write compositions better. How long do you expect to stay in the city?\" \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you how I am situated. I had twelve dollars in a savings bank in Newark, and I took it out without letting my father know. I was sure he wouldn\u0027t approve it, especially if he thought I was trying to go on the stage. You see he doesn\u0027t approve of theatres. It is very strange, considering that the greatest man that ever lived was an actor and dramatic author.\" [Pg 208] \"You mean Shakespeare?\" \"Yes. However, father is old-fashioned in his ideas. I should like to become a great actor, and make piles of money. Then he might be proud of me.\" Leslie\u0027s face flushed and his voice trembled, he was so carried away by the thought of becoming a dramatic star. \"You said you had twelve dollars?\" remarked Rupert, by way of bringing him back to solid ground. \"Yes; but I have spent four dollars, though I have tried to be economical. I pay seventy-five cents a day for my room, and that counts up.\" \"Yes, so it does. If you were going to stop long in the city I think I could get a room for you at two dollars a week.\" \"I should like that, but I can\u0027t pay even that if I don\u0027t get something to do.\" \"In that case I suppose you would go home.\" \"I should have to. I suppose my father is very angry at me.\" \"Did you leave home without letting him know?\" [Pg 209] \"Yes; I knew he wouldn\u0027t let me come if he knew my plans.\" \"Didn\u0027t you leave a note for him?\" \"Yes. I\u0027ll tell you what I wrote. I have a copy of it here.\" Leslie drew from his pocket a half sheet of note paper, and read aloud the following words: \"Dear Father— \"When you read these words I shall be far from home. I suppose I ought not to go, but I am tired of the country, and I want to win fame and fortune. I have a plan in view which I have considered for years. I won\u0027t tell you what it is now, for though strictly honorable, you might not approve it. I think I understand myself better than you do, though you are my father. I will let you hear from me soon. Your son, Leslie Waters.\" \"Of course you don\u0027t know how this was received by your father?\" \"I met a boy from Rahway this morning. He told me that father was mad, and said he washed his hands of me, that I was a fool, and would very soon find it out.\" \"Then you don\u0027t think he will pursue you?\" [Pg 210] \"No, he isn\u0027t that kind of a man.\" \"It will be rather awkward for you to go home.\" \"Yes. I wouldn\u0027t like to do that.\" \"Suppose you don\u0027t get a chance to go on the stage, would you be willing to take a business place?\" \"Yes, I would rather do that than go home. Here I should be in the midst of life, and if I bided my time I might get a chance to go on the stage after all.\" \"That is true. Now I will tell you why I asked. One of the bell-boys here is going to leave. I might get the position for you.\" \"You are a bell-boy, are you not?\" \"Yes.\" \"How much do you get?\" \"Five dollars a week and my meals. I have to hire a room outside.\" \"And you say I can get a room for two dollars a week?\" \"Yes. Perhaps for a dollar and a half.\" \"Then I could get along.\" \"You might not like the duties of a bell-boy.\" [Pg 211] \"What are they?\" Rupert explained. \"How early should I get off at night?\" \"At six o\u0027clock. The bell-boy who is about to leave is on through the day like myself.\" \"That would suit me. I could go to the theatre in the evening.\" \"True.\" \"If I don\u0027t get a chance to act to-day I will take the place if you can get it for me. It will be much better than going back to Rahway. Besides, my father will think better of me if he hears that I have found a place where I can make my expenses.\" \"Does he know that you have had thoughts of becoming an actor?\" \"No; I never told him, but my mother knows it.\" \"What does she say to it?\" \"She thinks I am smart enough to succeed, but fears I might get into bad company.\" \"There is danger of that.\" \"Not for me. I don\u0027t care for drinking, and I belong to the temperance society.\" [Pg 212] \"So do I.\" \"When a boy is ambitious to be great I don\u0027t think he is likely to get dissipated.\" \"Perhaps you are right. One thing I must say to you, Leslie. If you take the place of bell-boy you must try to give satisfaction.\" \"I will, for it will keep me in the city. In Rahway there is no chance of my rising in life.\" Rupert foresaw that there was very little chance of his new friend getting a position in any theatre, and he spoke at once to the manager of the hotel about giving a place as bell-boy to Leslie. \"Is he a friend of yours, Rupert?\" asked the manager. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Have you known him long?\" \"Not long enough to be sure that he will be satisfactory. Still you might be willing to take him on trial.\" \"I will try him for a week. If at the end of that time he suits me moderately well I will retain him.\" [Pg 213] \"I will coach him a little and instruct him in his duties.\" \"That will help.\" In the evening Leslie came home just before Rupert got through his day\u0027s work. He did not look as if he had succeeded. Still he was not as sober as the day before. \"Well?\" said Rupert. \"What luck?\" \"I don\u0027t get a place. In some of the theatres they did not treat me respectfully, though one manager admitted that he went on the stage earlier than I did.\" \"Where was that?\" \"In Brooklyn.\" \"Then I suppose you will be ready to accept the place of bell-boy?\" \"Yes; but if a chance should come of my going on the stage I should want to resign it.\" \"You had better not say anything about that. Wait till the chance comes.\" \"I have one piece of good news,\" said Leslie, more cheerfully. \"In two weeks a spectacular piece will be put on the stage at Niblo\u0027s, and they have promised me a place as supe.\" [Pg 214] \"How much will you be paid?\" \"Only twenty-five cents a night, but it will be a beginning. I shall have a place behind the footlights. More than one actor has made his start in that way.\" \"I am glad for you. I will go and see you when you make your first appearance.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3001/82809.html","bookId":300,"book":{"id":300,"title":"Rupert\u0027s Ambition","description":"简介： Rupert Rollins, a tall boy of sixteen, was engaged in folding some pieces of cloth which had been shown during the day to customers.
