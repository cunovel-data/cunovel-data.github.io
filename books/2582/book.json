Lilah the Lost Girl and Benny’s best friend Lou Chong are going with them. \n But before they even leave there is a shocking zombie attack in town, and as soon as they step into the Rot \u0026 Ruin they are pursued by the living dead, wild animals, insane murderers, and the horrors of Gameland—where teenagers are forced to fight for their lives in the zombie pits. Worst of all…could the evil Charlie Pink-eye still be alive? \n In the great Rot \u0026 Ruin, everything wants to kill you. And not everyone in Benny’s small band of travelers will survive….\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2.jpg","author":"Jonathan Maberry","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":48,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
