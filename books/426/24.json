{"id":20195,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV THE HOUSE IN THE YARD","content":"The Jew silently and promptly set out in the wake of the hurrying woman; presently she and her pursuer disappeared round a corner. \"That\u0027s the result of our call, Mapperley!\" said Hetherwick. \"She\u0027s gone somewhere—to tell somebody!\" \"Likely!\" assented Mapperley. \"But wherever she\u0027s gone, Issy Goldmark\u0027ll spot her. He\u0027s the eyes of a lynx.\" \"He let Baseverie slip him, the other night, though,\" remarked Hetherwick. \"Well, there was some excuse for that,\" said Mapperley, \"to begin with, he was only instructed to find out where Baseverie went, and to end with he had found out! He\u0027ll not let this woman slip him. She\u0027s good to follow—plenty of her.\" \"I wish we knew what she\u0027d left in that house,\" said Hetherwick. \"We\u0027ll have to find out, somehow!\" \"That\u0027s a police job,\" replied Mapperley. \"Can\u0027t walk into people\u0027s houses without a warrant. And you say Matherfield\u0027s on the other track? However, I should say that this woman\u0027s gone off now to find somebody who\u0027s principally concerned—she looked afraid, in my opinion, when she saw me.\" \"She\u0027s in it, somehow,\" muttered Hetherwick. \"That house looks mysterious enough for anything. We\u0027ll keep a close watch on it, anyway, until Goldmark comes back, however long that may be.\" But the Jew was back within twenty minutes. So was the woman. She came first, hurrying up the street quicker than when she had left it. As far as the watchers could make out from their vantage point, twenty yards away from her door, she looked flustered, distressed, upset. After her, on the opposite pavement, came Mr. Issy Goldmark, his hands in his pockets. The woman re-entered the house; they heard the door bang. A moment later the Jew turned into the entry in which Hetherwick and Mapperley stood, half hidden from the street. He smiled, inscrutably. \"Thee her go back to her houth?\" he asked. \"Well, I followed. I thaw where thee\u0027th been, too.\" \"Where, then?\" demanded Hetherwick, impatiently. Goldmark jerked his head in the direction from whence he had come. \"Round that corner,\" he said, \"you get into a regular thlum. Little thtreeth, alleyth, pathageth, and tho on. In one of \u0027em, a narrow plathe, where there\u0027th a thort of open-air market, there\u0027th a good thithed pieth of blank wall, with an iron-fathen\u0027d door in it. Well, the woman went in there—let herthelf in with a key that thee took from her pocket. Ath thoon ath thee\u0027d gone in, I took a clother look. The door\u0027th fathen\u0027d with iron, or thteel, ath I thaid—jolly thtrong. There ain\u0027t no name on it, and no keyhole that you can look through. The wall\u0027th a good nine or ten feet high, and it\u0027th covered with broken glath at the top. Not a nithe plathe to get into, nohow!\" \"Well?\" inquired Hetherwick. \"She went in?\" \"Went in, ath I thay, mithter, and the door clothed on her. After I\u0027d taken a glimpth at the door I got a potht behind one of the thtalls in the thtreet and watched. She came out again in about ten minitth—looked to me, too, ath if thee hadn\u0027t had a very plethant time inthide. Upthet! And thee thet off back here, fathter than vhat thee came. Now thee\u0027th gone into her houth again—ath you no doubt thaw. And that\u0027th all. But if I wath you, mithter,\" concluded Issy, \"I should jutht find out vhat there ith behind that door and the wall it\u0027th thet in—I thhould tho!\" \"That\u0027s a police job,\" said Mapperley once more. \"If we\u0027d only got Matherfield with us, we could——\" Hetherwick paused—thinking. \"Look here, Mapperley,\" he continued, with a sudden inspiration. \"I know what we\u0027ll do! You get a taxi-cab, as quickly as possible. Drive to the police station where I usually meet Matherfield. There\u0027s another man there whom I know, and who\u0027s pretty well up in this business—Detective-Sergeant Robmore. Ask for him. Tell him what we\u0027ve discovered, and ask him to come back with you and to bring another man if he thinks it necessary. Now then, Goldmark! Tell Mapperley exactly where this place is.\" The Jew pointed along the street to its first corner. \"Round that corner,\" he said. \"Firtht turning to the right; then firtht to the left; then firtht to the right—that\u0027th the thpot. Lot\u0027th o\u0027 little thtallth in it—a bithy, crowded plathe.\" \"Didn\u0027t ye notice the name?\" demanded Mapperley, half scoldingly. \"To be thure I did!\" grinned Goldmark. \"Pencove Thtreet. But it\u0027th better to dethcribe it than to name it. And don\u0027t you go tellin\u0027 no tackthy-driver to drive you in there!—cauth\u0027 there ain\u0027t room!\" Mapperley gave no answer to this piece of advice; he shot off in the direction of Victoria Street, and Hetherwick turned to the Jew. \"We\u0027ll go and have another look at this place, Goldmark,\" he said. \"But we\u0027ll go separately—as long as we\u0027re in this street, anyway. You stroll off to that first corner, and I\u0027ll join you.\" He crossed the street when the Jew had lounged away, and once more took a narrow look at the house into which the big woman had vanished. It was as close barred and curtained as ever; a veritable place of mystery. For a moment Hetherwick doubted whether he ought to leave it unwatched. But the descriptions of the wall and door in Pencove Street had excited his imagination, and he went on, turned the corner, and rejoined Goldmark. Goldmark at once went in front, piloting him into a maze of unusually dirty and crowded streets, and finally into one, narrower than the rest, on each side of which were tent-like stalls whereon all manner of cheap wares were being offered for sale by raucous-voiced vendors. He saw at once that this was one of those open-air markets of which there are many in the poorer neighbourhoods of London, and wherein you can buy a sixpenny frying-pan as readily as a paper of fried fish, and a gay neckerchief alongside a damaged orange. Threading his way behind Issy, and between the thronged stalls and the miserable shops that lined the pavement, Hetherwick presently came to the piece of blank wall of which the Jew had told him. The houses and shops round about were old and dilapidated, but the wall was either modern or had been rebuilt and strengthened. It stretched between two low houses, one used as a grocer\u0027s, the other as a hardware shop. In length, it was some thirty feet; in height, quite ten; its coping, as Goldmark had said, was liberally embattled with broken glass. The door, set flush with the adjoining masonry, was a solid affair, faced with metal, newly painted, and the lock was evidently a patent one. A significant fact struck Hetherwick at once—there was no sign of a bell and none of a knocker. \"You say the woman let herself in here?\" he asked, as he and Issy paused. \"That\u0027th it, mithter Hetherwick—let herthelf in,\" replied Issy. \"I thee her take the key from her pocket.\" Hetherwick glanced at the top of the wall. \"I wonder what\u0027s behind?\" he muttered. \"Building of some sort, of course.\" He turned to a man whose stall stood just in front of the mysterious door, and who at that moment had no trade. \"Do you know anything about this place?\" he asked. \"Do you know what\u0027s behind this wall? What building it is?\" The stall-keeper eyed Hetherwick over, silently and carefully. Deciding that he was an innocent person and not a policeman in plain clothes, he found his tongue. \"I don\u0027t, guv\u0027nor!\" he answered. \"\u0027Aint a bloomin\u0027 notion! I been comin\u0027 here, or hereabouts, this three year or more, but I \u0027aint never seen behind that wall, nor in at that there doorway. S\u0027elp me!\" \"But I suppose you\u0027ve seen people go in and come out of the door?\" suggested Hetherwick. \"It must be used for something!\" \"I reckon it is, guv\u0027nor, but I don\u0027t call nobody to mind, though, to be sure, I see a woman come out of it a while ago—big, heavy-jawed woman, she was. But queer as it may seem, I don\u0027t call to mind ever seeing anybody else. You see, guv\u0027nor, I comes here at about ten o\u0027clock of a morning, and I packs up and \u0027ops it at five—if there\u0027s folks comes in and out o\u0027 that spot, it must be early in a morning and late at night, and so I shouldn\u0027t see \u0027em. But it\u0027s my belief this here wall and door is back premises to something—the front o\u0027 the place\u0027ll be on the other side.\" \"That\u0027s a good idea,\" said Hetherwick, with a glance at Goldmark. \"Let\u0027s go round.\" But there was no going round. Although they tried various alleys and passages and streets that ought to have been parallel to Pencove Street, they failed to find any place that could be a frontage to the mysterious wall and its close-set door. But the Jew\u0027s alert faculties asserted themselves. \"We can thee vhat\u0027th behind that vail, mithter, eathy enough if we get one o\u0027 them thop-keeperth oppothit to let uth go upthtairth to hith firtht floor,\" he said. \"Look right acroth the thtreet there, thtallth and all, into vhatever there ith. Try that one,\" he went on, pointing to a greengrocer\u0027s establishment which faced the close-set door. \"Tell him we\u0027re doin\u0027 a bit o\u0027 land thurveyin\u0027—which ith thtrue!\" Hetherwick made his request—the greengrocer\u0027s lady showed him and Goldmark upstairs into a bow-windowed parlour, one of those dismal apartments which are only used on Sundays, for the purpose of adding more gloom to a gloomy day. She observed that there was a nice view both ways of the street, but Hetherwick confined his inspection to the front. He saw across the wall easily enough, now. There was little to see. The wall bounded a yard, bounded on its left and right sides by the walls of the adjoining houses, and at its further extremity by a low, squat building of red brick, erected against the rear of a high, windowless wall beyond. From its mere aspect, it was impossible to tell what this squat, flat-roofed structure was used for. Its door—closed—was visible; visible, too, were the windows on either side. But it was easy to see that they were obscured, as to their lower halves, by coats of dark paint. There was no sign over the building; no outward indication of its purpose. In the yard, however, were crates, boxes, and carboys in wicker cases; a curiously-shaped chimney, projecting from the roof above, suggested the presence of a furnace or forge beneath. And Hetherwick, after another look, felt no doubt that he was gazing at the place to which Hannaford had been taken, and where he had been skilfully poisoned. Goldmark suddenly nudged his arm, and nodded at the crowded street below. \"Mapperley!\" he whispered. \"And two men with him!\" Hetherwick, glancing in the direction indicated, saw Robmore and another man, both in plain clothes, making their way down the street, between the stalls and the shops. With them, and in close conversation, was a uniformed constable. He turned to leave the room, but Goldmark again touched his elbow. \"Before we go, mithter,\" he said, \"jutht take another glanth at that plathe oppothite, and it\u0027ths thurroundin\u0027th. I thee where we can get in! D\u0027ye thee, mithter Hetherwick, the wall between that yard and the next houth—the right-hand thide one—\u0027ith fairly low at the far end. Now, if the man in that houth would let uth go through to hith back-yard—vhat?\" \"I see!\" agreed Hetherwick. \"We\u0027ll try it. But Robmore first—come along.\" He slipped some silver into the hand of the green-grocer\u0027s lady, and went down to the street. A few brief explanations to the two detectives supplemented the information already given them by Mapperley, and then Robmore nodded at the constable who stood by, eagerly interested. \"We\u0027ve been talking to him, Mr. Hetherwick,\" he said. \"He\u0027s sometimes on day duty here, and sometimes he\u0027s on night. He says he\u0027s often wondered about this place, and it\u0027s a very queer thing that though he\u0027s known this district more than a year, he\u0027s never seen a soul go in or out of that door, and hasn\u0027t the least notion of what business, if it is a business, is carried on there!\" \"Never seen anything or anybody!\" corroborated the constable. \"At any time—day or night. When I first came on this beat, maybe fifteen months ago, that door had been newly set and painted, and the glass had just been stuck a-top of the wall. But it\u0027s a fact—I\u0027ve never seen anybody go in or come out!\" \"I propose to go in,\" said Hetherwick. \"I think we\u0027ve abundant cause, knowing what we do. It may be that the two missing ladies are there. I\u0027ve been having a look into the yard, and we could get into it easily by going through the grocer\u0027s shop there, on the right, and climbing the wall from his back premises. What do you say, Robmore?\" \"Oh, I think so!\" agreed Robmore. \"Now we\u0027re on the job, we\u0027ll carry it through. Better let me tackle the grocer, Mr. Hetherwick—I\u0027ll see him first and then call you in.\" The other waited while Robmore entered the shop and spoke with its owner. They saw him engaged in conversation for several minutes; then he came to the door and beckoned the rest to approach. \"That\u0027s all right,\" he said in an aside to Hetherwick. \"We can go through to his back-yard, and he\u0027ll lend us a step-ladder to get over the wall. But he\u0027s told me a bit—he knows the two men who have this place in the next yard, and there\u0027s no doubt at all, from his description of them, that one\u0027s Ambrose and the other Baseverie. He says they\u0027ve had the place almost eighteen months, and he thinks they use it as a laboratory—chemicals, or something of that sort. But he says they\u0027re rarely seen—sometimes he\u0027s never seen them for days and even weeks together. Usually they\u0027re there of a night—he\u0027s seen lights in the place at all hours of the night. Well—come on!\" The posse of investigators filed through the dark little shop to a yard at its rear, the grocer\u0027s apprentice going in front with a step-ladder, which he planted against the intervening wall at its lowest point. One by one, the uniformed constable going first, the six men climbed and dropped over. But for their own presence, the place seemed deserted and lifeless. As Hetherwick had observed from the greengrocer\u0027s parlour the windows were obscured by thick coats of paint; nevertheless, two or three of the men approached and tried to find places from which the paint had been scratched, in an effort to see what lay inside. But the constable, bolder and more direct, went straight to the entrance. \"Door\u0027s open!\" he exclaimed. \"Not even shut!\" He pushed the door wide, and went into the building, the rest crowding after him. \"Hullo!\" he shouted. \"Hullo!\" No answer came to the summons. The constable crossed the lobby in which they were all standing, and opened an inner door. And Hetherwick saw at once that the grocer\u0027s surmise as to the purpose to which the place was put had been correct—this was a chemical laboratory, well equipped, too, with modern apparatus. But there was not a sign of life in it. \"Nobody here, apparently,\" murmured one of the men. \"Flown!\" Robmore went forward to another door, and opening it, revealed a room furnished as an office. There was a roll-top desk in it, and papers and documents lying there; he and Hetherwick began to finger and examine them. And Hetherwick suddenly saw something that made a link between this mysterious place and the house he had called at earlier in the afternoon. There, before his eyes, lay some of the azure-tinted notepaper which Mapperley had traced with the embossed address on it of which the stationer had told. \"There\u0027s no doubt we\u0027ve hit on the place at last, Robmore,\" he said. \"I wish we\u0027d had Matherfield here. But——\" Before he could say more, a sudden shout came from Goldmark, who, while the others were investigating the lower regions, had courageously, and alone, gone up the low staircase to the upper rooms. \"Mithter!\" he called. \"Mithter Hetherwick! come up here—come up, all of you. Here\u0027th a man here, a-thittin\u0027 in a chair—and th\u0027elp me if I don\u0027t believe he\u0027th a thtiff \u0027un—dead!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300/90287.html","bookId":426,"book":{"id":426,"title":"The Charing Cross Mystery","description":"简介： Hetherwick had dined that evening with friends who lived in Cadogan Gardens, and had stayed so late in conversation with his host that midnight had come before he left and set out for his bachelor chambers in the Temple; it was, indeed, by the fracti...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
