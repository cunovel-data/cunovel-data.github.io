{"id":20188,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII THE TORN LABELS","content":"Penteney strode forward and picked up the telegram; a moment later he passed it over to Hetherwick. \"That\u0027s most unfortunate!\" he exclaimed. \"And unexpected, too! Of course, the fellow\u0027s slipped off to the Continent.\" Matherfield looked over Hetherwick\u0027s shoulder and read the message. \"Followed him down here last night. Put up at same hotel, but he slipped me and got clear away early this morning. Returning now.\" \"You should have employed two men, gentlemen,\" said Matherfield. \"One\u0027s not enough—in a case of that sort. But it\u0027s as I said before—this man should have been given into custody at once. However——\" He got up from his chair, as if there was no more to be said, and moved towards the door. But half-way across the room he paused. \"You\u0027ll let me know if anybody comes forward about that reward?\" he suggested. \"It\u0027s more of a police matter, you know.\" The two partners, who were obviously much annoyed by the telegram, nodded. \"We shall let you know—at once,\" answered Blenkinsop. \"Of course, you\u0027ll regard all we\u0027ve told you as strictly confidential?\" \"Oh, to be sure, sir,\" replied Matherfield. \"It\u0027s not the only private and confidential feature of this affair, I assure you.\" Outside he turned to Hetherwick. \"Well!\" he said. \"We\u0027ve cleared up a few things, Mr. Hetherwick—or, rather, those two have cleared them up for us. But are we any nearer answering the question that we want answering—who poisoned Robert Hannaford?\" \"I think we are!\" replied Hetherwick. \"I am, anyhow! Either Baseverie poisoned him—or he knows who did!\" \"Knows who did!\" repeated Matherfield. \"Ah!—that\u0027s more like it. I don\u0027t think he did it—he wouldn\u0027t be so ready about showing himself forward.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure of that,\" remarked Hetherwick. \"From what we\u0027ve heard of him, he seems to be a bold and daring sort of scamp. Probably he thought he\u0027d have a very easy prey in Lady Riversreade; probably, too, he believed that a woman who\u0027s got all that money would make little to do about parting with thirty thousand pounds. One thing\u0027s sure, however—Baseverie knows what we want to know. And—he\u0027s gone!\" \"Perhaps—perhaps!\" said Matherfield. \"And perhaps not. This man of Penteney\u0027s no doubt tracked him to Dover, and there he lost him, but that isn\u0027t saying that Baseverie\u0027s gone on the Continent. If Baseverie\u0027s the cute customer that he seems to be, he\u0027d put two and two together when Major Penteney warned him off Riversreade Court. He\u0027d probably suspect Penteney of setting a watch on him; he may have spotted the very man who was watching. Then, if he\u0027d any sense, he\u0027d lead that man a bit of a dance, and eventually double on him. No!—I should say Baseverie\u0027s back here in town! That\u0027s about it, Mr. Hetherwick. But what\u0027s this? Here\u0027s one of my men coming to meet us. I left word where I should be found.\" Hetherwick looked up and saw a man, who was obviously a policeman in plain clothes, coming towards them. He was a quiet-looking, stodgy-faced man, but he had news written all over his plain face. \"Well, Marler?\" inquired Matherfield as they met. \"Got something?\" There was nobody about in that quiet corner of Lincoln\u0027s Inn Fields, yet the man looked round as if anxious to escape observation, and he spoke in a whisper. \"I believe I\u0027ve got that chemist!\" he answered. \"Leastways, it\u0027s like this. There\u0027s a chemist I tried this morning—name of Macpherson, in Maiden Lane. I showed him the facsimiles of the lost labels on the medicine bottles, and asked him if he could give me any information. He\u0027s a very cautious sort of man, I think; he examined the facsimiles a long time, saying nothing. Then he said he supposed I was a policeman, and so on, and of course I had to tell him a bit—only a bit. Then he said, all of a sudden, \u0027Look here, my friend,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027d better tell me, straight out—has this to do with that Hannaford poisoning case?\u0027 So, of course, I said that, between ourselves, it had. \u0027Isn\u0027t Matherfield in charge of that?\u0027 he said. Of course, I said you were. \u0027Very well\u0027 he said. \u0027You send Matherfield to me. I\u0027m not going to say anything to you,\u0027 he said. \u0027What I\u0027ve got to say I\u0027ll say to Matherfield.\u0027 So I went back to head-quarters, and they told me you\u0027d gone to Lincoln\u0027s Inn Fields.\" \"All right, my lad!\" said Matherfield. \"If you\u0027ve found the right man, I\u0027ll remember you. What\u0027s his name—Macpherson, Maiden Lane? Very good—then I\u0027ll just step along and see him. Not a word to anybody, Marler!\" he added, as the man turned away. \"Keep close. Now, this is a bit of all right, Mr. Hetherwick!\" he continued, chuckling and rubbing his hands. \"This beats all we heard at Penteney\u0027s! Only let me get the name and address of the man for whom that bottle of medicine was made up, and I think I shall have taken a long stride! But come along—we\u0027ll see the chemist together.\" The shop in Maiden Lane before which they presently paused was a small, narrow-fronted, old-fashioned establishment, with little in its windows beyond the usual coloured bottles and over the front no more than the name \"Macpherson\" in faded gilt letters on a time-stained signboard. It was dark and stuffy within the shop, and Hetherwick had to strain his eyes to see a tall, thin, elderly, spectacled man, very precise and trim in appearance, who stood behind the single counter, silently regarding him and Matherfield. \"Mr. Macpherson?\" inquired Matherfield. \"Just so! Good morning, sir. My name is Matherfield—Inspector Matherfield. One of my men tells me——\" \"One moment!\" interrupted the chemist. He stepped behind a screen at the rear of his shop and presently returned with a young man, to whom he whispered a word or two. Then he beckoned to his two visitors, and opening a door at the further corner, ushered them into a private parlour. \"We shall be to ourselves here, Mr. Matherfield,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ve no doubt your business is of a highly confidential nature.\" \"Something of that sort, Mr. Macpherson,\" assented Matherfield, as he and Hetherwick took chairs at a centre table. \"But my man\u0027ll have prepared you a bit, no doubt. He tells me he showed you the photographed facsimiles of certain torn labels that are on a medicine bottle which figures in the Hannaford case, and that in consequence of your seeing them you asked to see me. Well, sir, here I am!\" \"Aye, just so, Mr. Matherfield, just so, precisely,\" replied the chemist, turning up the gas-jet which hung above the table. \"Aye, to be sure!\" He, too, sat down at the table, and folded his thin long fingers together. \"Aye, and you\u0027ll be thinking, Mr. Matherfield, that yon bottle has something to do with the poisoning of Hannaford?\" \"I\u0027ll be candid with you, Mr. Macpherson,\" answered Matherfield. \"But first let me ask you something. Have you read the newspaper accounts of this affair?\" \"I\u0027ve done that, Mr. Matherfield—yes, all I could lay hands on.\" \"Then you\u0027ll be aware that there was another man poisoned as well as Hannaford—a man named Granett, who was in Hannaford\u0027s company on the night when it all happened? This gentleman here is the one that was in the Underground train and saw Hannaford die, and Granett make off, as he said, to fetch a doctor.\" \"That\u0027ll be Mr. Hetherwick, I\u0027m thinking,\" said the chemist, with a polite bow. \"Aye, just so!\" \"I see you\u0027ve read the reports of the inquest,\" remarked Matherfield, with a smile. \"Very well, as I say, Granett was found dead later. I discovered a medicine bottle and a glass at his bedside. There\u0027d been whisky in both, but according to the medical experts there had also been poison—the traces, they say, were indisputable. Now, on that medicine bottle were two torn labels—on the upper one, as you see from the facsimile photograph, there\u0027s been a name written—all that\u0027s left is the initial C. and the first letter of a surname, A. All the rest\u0027s gone. And what I want to know is—are you the chemist that made up the medicine or the tonic, or whatever it was, that was in that bottle, and, if so, who is the customer for whom you made it, and whose Christian name begins with C. and surname with A.? Do you comprehend me?\" \"Aye, aye, Mr. Matherfield!\" answered the chemist eagerly. \"I\u0027m appreciating every word you\u0027re saying, and very lucid it all is. And I\u0027m willing to give you all the information in my power, but first I\u0027d just like to have a bit myself on a highly pertinent matter. Now, you\u0027ll be aware, Mr. Matherfield, if you\u0027ve seen the newspapers of this last day or two, that there\u0027s a firm of solicitors in Lincoln\u0027s Inn Fields that\u0027s offering a reward of five thousand pounds——\" \"I\u0027m well enough aware of it, Mr. Macpherson,\" interrupted Matherfield with a laugh and a sly glance at Hetherwick. \"Mr. Hetherwick and myself have just come straight from their office, and what you want to know is—if you give me information will it be the same thing as giving it to them? You want to make sure about the reward?\" \"Precisely, Mr. Matherfield, precisely!\" assented the chemist eagerly. \"You\u0027ve hit my meaning exactly. For, of course, when there\u0027s a reward like yon——\" \"If you give us information, Mr. Macpherson, that\u0027ll lead to the arrest and conviction of the guilty party, you can rest assured you\u0027ll get that reward,\" said Matherfield. \"And Mr. Hetherwick\u0027ll support me in that, I\u0027m sure.\" \"I\u0027m satisfied—I\u0027m satisfied, gentlemen!\" exclaimed Macpherson, as Hetherwick murmured his confirmation. \"Well, it\u0027s a strange, black business, and I\u0027d no idea that I would come to be associated with it until that man of yours called in this morning, Mr. Matherfield. But then I knew! And I\u0027ll shorten matters by telling you, at once—I made up the tonic that was in that bottle!\" Matherfield rubbed his hands. \"Good!\" he said quietly. \"Good! And now, then—the critical question! For whom?\" \"For a Dr. Charles Ambrose, from a prescription of his own,\" replied Macpherson. \"It\u0027s a sort of pick-me-up tonic. I first made it up for him two years ago; I\u0027ve made it up for him several times since. The last occasion was about six weeks ago. I have all the dates, though, in my books; I can show you them.\" \"Wait a bit,\" said Matherfield. \"That\u0027s of no great importance—yet. Dr. Charles Ambrose, eh? Have you his address?\" \"Aye, to be sure!\" answered the chemist. \"His address is 38, Number 59, John Street.\" \"Adelphi!\" suggested Matherfield. \"Adelphi, precisely—38, Number 59, John Street, Adelphi,\" repeated Macpherson. \"That\u0027s in the books, too.\" Matherfield suddenly became silent, staring at the floor. When he looked up again it was at Hetherwick. \"Didn\u0027t Granett exclaim that he knew of a doctor, close by, when he rushed out of that train at Charing Cross Underground?\" he asked. \"Gave the impression that he knew of one close by, anyway?\" \"He said distinctly close by,\" answered Hetherwick. \"Why, are you thinking——\" Matherfield interrupted him with a wave of the hand, and turned again to the chemist. \"You\u0027ve seen this Dr. Charles Ambrose?\" he asked abruptly. \"Oh, I have, Mr. Matherfield, many a time and often,\" replied Macpherson. \"But now I come to think of it, not lately.\" \"When—last?\" demanded Matherfield. \"I should think last when he called in and told me to make him another bottle of his tonic,\" answered Macpherson, after some thought. \"As I said just now, perhaps about six weeks ago. But the books——\" \"Never mind the books yet. What\u0027s this Dr. Charles Ambrose like?\" \"A tall, handsome man, distinguished-looking—I should say about forty years of age. A dark man—hair, eyes, beard. He wears his moustache and beard in—well, a sort of foreign fashion; in fact, he\u0027s more like a Spaniard than an Englishman.\" \"But—is he an Englishman?\" \"He was always taken by me for an Englishman; he speaks like one—that is, like an Englishman of the upper classes. He once told me he was an Oxford man—we\u0027d been talking about universities.\" \"Well-dressed man?\" \"Aye, he was that! A smart, fine man.\" \"Did you ever see him in a big, dark overcoat, with a large white silk muffler about his neck and the lower part of his face?\" \"Aye, I\u0027ve seen him like that! On chilly evenings. Indeed, that\u0027s another thing he told me—he was subject to bronchial attacks.\" \"Muffled himself well up, eh?\" suggested Matherfield. \"Aye, just so! He\u0027s been in here like that.\" Matherfield turned to Hetherwick with a significant glance. \"That\u0027s the man who met Hannaford at Victoria Station that night!—the man that Ledbitter saw, and that nobody\u0027s seen since!\" he exclaimed. \"A million to one on it! Now then, who is he?\" \"You know his name and his address,\" remarked Hetherwick. \"Yes—and I know, too, that Mr. Macpherson here hasn\u0027t seen him lately!\" retorted Matherfield dryly. \"How often, now, Mr. Macpherson, did you use to see him? I mean, did you use to see him at other times than when he came into your shop?\" \"Oh, yes! I\u0027ve seen him in the street, outside,\" replied the chemist. \"I\u0027ve seen him, too, going in and out of Rule\u0027s, and in and out of Romano\u0027s.\" \"In other words,\" remarked Matherfield, \"he was pretty well known about this end of the Strand. I\u0027m not sure, now, that I don\u0027t remember such a man myself—black, silky, carefully-trimmed beard, always a big swell. But—Mr. Macpherson hasn\u0027t seen him lately! Hm! Do you know if he was in practice, Mr. Macpherson?\" \"I could not say as to that, Mr. Matherfield. Seeing that he called himself Dr. Ambrose, I supposed he was a medical practitioner, but I don\u0027t know what his degrees or qualifications were at all.\" Matherfield glanced at a row of books which stood over a desk at the side of the parlour. \"Have you got an up-to-date medical directory?\" he asked. \"Good! Let\u0027s look the man up. You turn up his name, Mr. Hetherwick,\" he went on as the chemist handed down a volume; \"you\u0027re more used to books than I am. Find out if there\u0027s anything about him.\" Hetherwick turned over the pages of the directory, and presently shook his head. \"There\u0027s no Charles Ambrose here,\" he said. \"Look for yourselves.\" Matherfield glanced at the place indicated and said nothing. Macpherson made an exclamation of surprise. \"Aye, well, he may be a foreigner, after all,\" he observed. \"But I shouldn\u0027t have considered him one, and he certainly told me he was an Oxford graduate.\" \"Foreigner or Oxforder, I\u0027m going to know more about him!\" declared Matherfield, rising and grasping his stick with an air of determination. \"Well, Mr. Macpherson, we\u0027re obliged to you, and if this results in anything—you know! But for the moment—a bit of that caution that you Scotsmen are famous for—eh?\" Outside, Matherfield laid his hand on Hetherwick\u0027s elbow. \"Mr. Hetherwick,\" he said solemnly, \"we\u0027re on the track—at last! Sure as my name\u0027s Matherfield, we\u0027ve hit the trail! Now we\u0027re going to John Street, Adelphi—and I\u0027ll lay you anything you like that the man\u0027s vanished!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300/90280.html","bookId":426,"book":{"id":426,"title":"The Charing Cross Mystery","description":"简介： Hetherwick had dined that evening with friends who lived in Cadogan Gardens, and had stayed so late in conversation with his host that midnight had come before he left and set out for his bachelor chambers in the Temple; it was, indeed, by the fracti...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
