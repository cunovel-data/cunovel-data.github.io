{"id":20181,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR","content":"The head-waiter in the restaurant to which Hetherwick and Rhona repaired every Sunday immediately upon her arrival now knew these two well by sight, and forming his own conclusions about them, always reserved for them a table in a quiet and secluded corner. Hither they now proceeded, and had scarcely taken their accustomed seats before Rhona plunged into her story. \"I expect you want to know what it\u0027s all about, so I won\u0027t keep you waiting,\" she said. \"It was on Friday—Friday morning—that it happened, and I half thought of writing to you about it that evening. Then I thought it best to tell you personally to-day—besides, I should have had to write an awfully long letter. There are things to explain; I\u0027d better explain them first. Our arrangements down there at Riversreade, for instance. They\u0027re like this: Lady Riversreade and I always breakfast together at the Court, about nine o\u0027clock. At ten we go across the grounds to the Home. There we have a sort of formal office—two rooms, one of which, the first opening from the hall, I have, the other, opening out of it, is Lady Riversreade\u0027s private sanctum. In the hall itself we have an ex-army man, Mitchell, as hall-porter, to attend to the door and so on. All the morning we are busy with letters, accounts, reports of the staff, and that sort of thing. We have lunch at the Home, and we\u0027re generally busy until four or five o\u0027clock. Got all that?\" \"Every scrap!\" replied Hetherwick. \"Perfectly plain.\" \"Very well,\" continued Rhona. \"One more detail, however. A good many people, chiefly medical men and folk interested in homes and hospitals, call, wanting to look over and to know about the place—which, I may tell you in parenthesis, costs Lady Riversreade a pretty tidy penny! Mitchell\u0027s instructions as regards all callers are to bring their cards to me—I interview them first; if I can deal with them, I do; if I think it necessary or desirable, I take them in to Lady Riversreade. We have to sort them out—some, I am sure, come out of mere idle curiosity; in fact, the only visitors we want to see there are either medical men who have a genuine interest in the place and can do something for it, or people who are connected with its particular inmates. Well, on Friday morning last, about a quarter to twelve, as I was busy with my letters, I heard a car come up the drive, and presently Mitchell came into my room with a card bearing the name Dr. Cyprian Baseverie. Instead of being an engraved card as, by all the recognised standards, it should have been, it was a printed card—that was the first thing I noticed.\" \"Your powers of observation,\" remarked Hetherwick admiringly, \"are excellent, and should prove most useful.\" \"Thank you for the compliment!—but that didn\u0027t need much observation,\" retorted Rhona with a laugh. \"It was obvious. However, I asked Mitchell what Dr. Baseverie wanted; Mitchell replied that the gentleman desired an interview with Lady Riversreade. Now, as I said before, we never refuse doctors, so I told Mitchell to bring Dr. Baseverie to me. A moment later Dr. Baseverie entered. I want to describe him particularly, and you must listen most attentively. Figure, then, to yourself a man of medium height, neither stout nor slender, but comfortably plump, and apparently about forty-five years of age, dressed very correctly and fashionably in a black morning coat and vest, dark striped trousers, immaculate as to linen and neckwear, and furnished with a new silk hat, pearl-grey gloves and a tightly rolled gold-mounted umbrella. Incidentally, he wore a thin gold watch-chain, white spats and highly polished shoes. Got that?\" \"I see him—his clothes and things, I mean,\" assented Hetherwick. \"Fashionable medico sort, evidently! But—himself?\" \"Now his face,\" continued Rhona. \"Imagine a man with an almost absolutely bloodless countenance—a face the colour of old ivory—lighted by a pair of peculiarly piercing eyes, black as sloes, and the pallor of the face heightened by a rather heavy black moustache and equally black, slightly crinkled hair, thick enough above the ears but becoming sparse and thin on the crown. Imagine, too, a pair of full, red lips above a round but determined chin and a decidedly hooked nose, and you have—the man I\u0027m describing!\" \"Um!\" said Hetherwick reflectingly. \"Hebraic, I think, from your description.\" \"That\u0027s just what I thought myself,\" agreed Rhona. \"I said to myself at once, \u0027Whatever and whoever else you are, my friend, you\u0027re a Jew!\u0027 But the creature\u0027s manner and speech were English enough—very English. He had all the well-accustomed air of the medical practitioner who is also a bit of a man of the world, and I saw at once that anybody who tried to fence with him would usually come off second-best. His explanation of his presence was reasonable and commonplace enough: he was deeply interested in the sort of cases we had in the Home, and desired to acquaint himself with our methods and arrangements and so on. He made use of a few technical terms and phrases which were quite beyond my humble powers, and I carried in his card to Lady Riversreade. Lady Riversreade is always accessible when there\u0027s a doctor in the case, and in two minutes Dr. Baseverie was closeted with her.\" \"That ends the first chapter, I suppose?\" said Hetherwick. \"Interesting—very! A good curtain! And the next?\" \"The events of the second chapter,\" replied Rhona, \"took place in Lady Riversreade\u0027s room, and I cannot even guess at their nature. I can only tell of things that I know. But there\u0027s a good deal in that. To begin with, although Dr. Baseverie had said to me that he desired to see the Home—which, of course, in the ordinary way meant his being either taken round by Lady Riversreade or by our resident house physician—he was not taken round. He never left that room from the moment he entered it until the moment in which he left it. And he remained in it an entire hour!\" \"With Lady Riversreade?\" \"With Lady Riversreade! She never left it, either. Nor did I go into it; she hates me to go in if she has anybody with her at any time. No!—there those two were together, from ten minutes to twelve until five minutes to one. Yet the man had said that he wanted to look round!\" \"Is there any other way by which they could have left that room?\" suggested Hetherwick. \"Another door—or a French window?\" \"There is nothing of the sort. The door into my room is the only means of entrance or exit to or from Lady Riversreade\u0027s. No—they were there all the time.\" \"Did you hear anything?\" \"Nothing! The house in which Lady Riversreade set up this Home is an old, solid, well-built one—none of your modern gimcrack work in it!—it\u0027s a far better house than the Court, grand as that may be. All the doors and windows fit—I never heard a sound from the room.\" \"Well,\" asked Hetherwick, after due meditation, \"and at the end of the hour?\" \"At the end of the hour the door suddenly opened and Dr. Baseverie appeared, hat, gloves and umbrella in hand. He half turned as he came out and said a few words to Lady Riversreade. I heard them. He said, \u0027Well, then, next Friday morning at the same time?\u0027 Then he nodded, stepped into my room, closed the door behind him, made me a very polite, smiling bow as he passed my desk, and went out. A moment later he drove off in the car—it had been waiting at the entrance all that time.\" \"I suppose that\u0027s the end of chapter two,\" suggested Hetherwick. \"Is there more?\" \"Some,\" responded Rhona. \"During the hour which Dr. Baseverie had spent with Lady Riversreade I had been very busy typing letters. When he had gone I took them into her room, so that she could sign them. I suppose I was a bit curious about what had just happened and may have been more than usually observant—anyway, I felt certain that the visit of this man, whoever he is, had considerably upset Lady Riversreade. She looked it.\" \"Precisely how?\" inquired Hetherwick. \"Well, I couldn\u0027t exactly tell you. Perhaps a man wouldn\u0027t have noticed it. But being a woman, I did. She was perturbed—she\u0027d been annoyed, or distressed, or surprised, or—something. I saw signs which, as a woman, were unmistakable—to a woman. The man\u0027s visit had been distasteful—troubling. I\u0027m as certain of that as I am that this is roast mutton.\" \"Did she say anything?\" \"Not one word. She was unusually taciturn—silent, in fact. She took the letters in silence, signed them in silence. No, on reflection, she never spoke a word while I was in the room. I took the letters away and began putting them in their envelopes. Soon afterwards Lady Riversreade came through my room and went out, and I saw her go across the grounds to the Court. She didn\u0027t turn up at the usual luncheon at the Home, and I didn\u0027t see her again that afternoon. In fact, I didn\u0027t see her again that day, for when I went home to the Court at five o\u0027clock, Lady Riversreade\u0027s maid told me that her mistress had gone up to town and wouldn\u0027t be home until late that night. I went to bed before she returned.\" \"Next morning?\" suggested Hetherwick. \"Next morning she was just as usual, and things went on in the usual way.\" \"Did she ever mention this man and his visit to you?\" asked Hetherwick. \"No—not a word of him. But I found out something about him myself on Friday afternoon.\" \"What? Something relevant?\" \"May be relevant to—something. I was wondering about him—and his printed card. I thought it odd that a medical man, so smartly dressed and all that, should present a card like that—not one well printed, a cheap thing! Besides, it had no address. I wondered—mere inquisitiveness, perhaps—where the creature came from. Now, we\u0027ve a jolly good lot of the usual reference-books there at the Home—and there\u0027s a first-class right up-to-date medical directory amongst them. So I looked up the name of Dr. Cyprian Baseverie. I say, looked it up—but I didn\u0027t do that—for it wasn\u0027t there! He\u0027s neither an English, nor a Scottish, nor an Irish medical man.\" \"Foreigner, then,\" said Hetherwick. \"French, perhaps, or—American.\" \"May be an Egyptian, or a Persian, or a Eurasian, for anything I know,\" remarked Rhona. \"What I know is that he\u0027s not on the list in that directory, though from his speech and manner you\u0027d think he\u0027d been practising in the West End all his life! Anyway, that\u0027s the story. Is there anything in it?\" Hetherwick picked up his glass of claret by its stem and looked thoughtfully through the contents of the bowl. \"The particular thing is—the extent and quality of Lady Riversreade\u0027s annoyance, or dismay, or perturbation, occasioned by the man\u0027s visit,\" he said at last. \"If she was really very much upset——\" \"If you want my honest opinion as eye-witness and as woman,\" remarked Rhona, \"Lady Riversreade was very much upset. She gave me the impression that she\u0027d just received very bad, disconcerting, unpleasant news. After seeing and watching her as she signed the letters I had no doubt whatever that the man had deliberately lied to me when he said he wanted to see the Home and its working—what he really wanted was access to Lady Riversreade.\" \"Look here!\" exclaimed Hetherwick suddenly \"Were you present when this man went into Lady Riversreade\u0027s room?\" \"Present? Of course I was! I took him in—myself.\" \"You saw them meet?\" \"To be sure!\" \"Well, then, you know! Were they strangers? Did she recognise him? Did she show any sign of recognition whatever when she set eyes on him?\" \"No, none! I\u0027m perfectly certain she\u0027d never seen the man before in her life! I could see quite well that he was an absolute stranger to her.\" \"And she to him?\" \"Oh, that I don\u0027t know! He may have seen her a thousand times. But I\u0027m sure she\u0027d never seen him.\" Hetherwick laid down his knife and fork with a gesture of finality. \"I\u0027m going to find out who that chap is,\" he answered. \"Got to!\" \"You think his visit may have something to do with this?\" asked Rhona. \"May, yes. Anyway, I\u0027m not going to let any chance go. There\u0027s enough mystery in what you tell me about the man to make it worth while following him up. It must be done.\" \"How will you do it?\" \"You say he said that he was going there again next Friday at the same time? Well, the thing to do, then, is to watch and follow him when he goes away.\" \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m no use for that! He\u0027d know me.\" \"Nor am I!—I\u0027m too conspicuous,\" laughed Hetherwick. \"If I were a head and shoulders shorter, I might be some use. But I\u0027ve got the very man—my clerk, one Mapperley. He\u0027s just the sort to follow and dog anybody and yet never be seen himself. As you\u0027ll say, when you\u0027ve the pleasure of seeing him, Mapperley\u0027s the most ordinary, commonplace chap you ever set eyes on—pass absolutely unnoticed in any Cockney crowd. But he\u0027s as sharp as they make \u0027em, veiling a peculiar astuteness under his eminently undistinguished features. And what I shall do is this—I\u0027ll give Mapperley a full and detailed description of Dr. Cyprian Baseverie: I\u0027ve memorised yours already; Mapperley will memorise mine. Now Baseverie, whoever he may be, will probably go down to Dorking by the 10.10 from here; so will Mapperley. And after Mapperley has once spotted his man, he\u0027ll not lose sight of him.\" \"And he\u0027ll do—what?\" asked Rhona. \"Follow him to Dorking—watch him—follow him back to London—find out where he goes when he returns—run him to earth, in fact. Then he\u0027ll report to me—and we shall know more than we do now, and also what to do next.\" \"I wonder what it\u0027s all going to lead to?\" said Rhona. \"Pretty much of a maze, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It is,\" agreed Hetherwick. \"But if we can only get a firm hold on a thread——\" \"And that might break!\" she laughed. \"Well, then, one that won\u0027t break,\" he said. \"There are several loose ends lying about already. Matherfield\u0027s got a hold on one or two.\" He went to see Matherfield next morning and told him the story that he had heard from Rhona. Matherfield grew thoughtful. \"Well, Mr. Hetherwick,\" he said, after a pause, \"it\u0027s as I\u0027ve said before—if this Lady Riversreade is mixed up in it, the thing to do is to go back and get as full a history as can possibly be got of her antecedents. We\u0027ll have to get on to that—but we\u0027ll wait to see what that clerk of yours discovers about this man. There may be something in it—in the meantime I\u0027m hard at work on my own clues.\" \"Any luck?\" asked Hetherwick. \"Scarcely that. But, as I say, we\u0027re at work. The five-pound note is a difficult matter. Given in change, of course, at Vivian\u0027s Night Club—but they tell me there that it\u0027s no uncommon thing to change ten, twenty, and even fifty-pound notes for their customers—it\u0027s a swell lot who forgather there—and of course they\u0027ve no recollection whatever about that particular note or night. Still, the fact remains—that note came through Vivian\u0027s, and through one of its frequenters, to Granett, and I\u0027m in hopes.\" \"And the medicine bottle?\" suggested Hetherwick. \"Ah, there is more chance!\" responded Matherfield, with a lightening eye. \"That\u0027s only a question of time! I\u0027ve got a man going round all the chemists in the West Central district—stiff job, for there are more of \u0027em than I believed. But he\u0027s bound to hit on the right one eventually. And then—well, we shall have a pretty good idea, if not positive proof, as to how Granett got hold of the stuff that poisoned him.\" \"I suppose there\u0027s no doubt that there was poison in that bottle?\" inquired Hetherwick. \"According to the specialists, none,\" replied Matherfield. \"And in the glass too. What sort of poison, I don\u0027t know—you know what these experts are—so mysterious about things! But they have told me this—the stuff that settled Granett was identical with that which finished off Hannaford. That\u0027s certain.\" \"Then it probably came from the same source,\" said Hetherwick. \"Oh, my notion is that the man or men who poisoned one man poisoned the other,\" exclaimed Matherfield. \"And at the same time. At least, I think Granett got his dose at the same time—probably carried it off in his pocket and drank it when he got home. But—we shall trace that bottle! Let me know what you find out about this man Baseverie, Mr. Hetherwick—every little helps.\" Hetherwick duly coached Mapperley in the part he wanted him to play, and Mapperley, with money in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth, lounged off to Victoria on the following Friday morning. His principal saw nothing and heard nothing of him all that day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300/90273.html","bookId":426,"book":{"id":426,"title":"The Charing Cross Mystery","description":"简介： Hetherwick had dined that evening with friends who lived in Cadogan Gardens, and had stayed so late in conversation with his host that midnight had come before he left and set out for his bachelor chambers in the Temple; it was, indeed, by the fracti...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3300","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:45 AM"}}
