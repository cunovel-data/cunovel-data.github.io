{"id":91162,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Black-haired barbarians, screaming in the frenzy of battle, burst into the copse. Drizzt realized at once that these burly warriors were the forms he had seen moving behind the orcan ranks on the field, but he wasn\u0027t yet certain of their allegiance. Whatever their ties, their arrival struck terror into the remaining orcs. The two fighting Drizzt lost all heart for the battle, a sudden shift in their posture revealing their desire to break off the confrontation and flee. Drizzt obliged, assured that they wouldn\u0027t get far anyway, and sensing that he, too, would be wise to slip from sight. The orcs fled, but their pursuers soon caught them in another battle just beyond the trees. Less obvious in his flight, Drizzt slipped unnoticed back up the tree where he had left his bow. Wulfgar could not so easily sublimate his battle lust. With two of his friends down, his thirst for orcan blood was insatiable, and the new group of men that had joined the fight cried out to Tempus, his own god of battle, with a fervor that the young warrior could not ignore. Distracted by the sudden developments, the ring of orcs around Wulfgar let up for just a moment, and he struck hard. One orc looked away, and Aegis-fang tore its face off before its eyes returned to the fight at hand. Wulfgar bore through the gap in the ring, jostling a second orc as he passed. As it stumbled in its attempt to turn and realign its defense, the mighty barbarian chopped it down. The two remaining turned and fled, but Wulfgar was right behind. He launched his hammer, blasting one from life, and sprang upon the other, bearing it to the ground beneath him and then crushing the life from it with his bare hands. When he was finished, when he had heard the final crack of neckbone, Wulfgar remembered his predicament and his friends. He sprang up and backed away, his back against the trees. The black-haired barbarians kept their distance, respectful of his prowess, and Wulfgar could not be sure of their intentions. He scanned around for his friends. Regis and Bruenor lay side by side near where the horses had been tethered; he could not tell if they were alive or dead. There was no sign of Drizzt, but a fight continued beyond the other edge of the trees. The warriors fanned out in a wide semi-circle around him, cutting off any routes of escape. But they stopped their positioning suddenly, for Aegis-fang had magically returned to Wulfgar\u0027s grasp. He could not win against so many, but the thought did not dismay him. He would die fighting, as a true warrior, and his death would be remembered. If the black-haired barbarians came at him, many, he knew, would not return to their families. He dug his heels in and clasped the warhammer tightly. \"Let us be done with it,\" he growled into the night. \"Hold!\" came a soft, but imperative whisper from above. Wulfgar recognized Drizzt\u0027s voice at once and relaxed his grip. \"Keep to your honor, but know that more lives are at stake than your own!\" Wulfgar understood then that Regis and Bruenor were probably still alive. He dropped Aegis-fang to the ground and called out to the warriors, \"Well met.\" They did not reply, but one of them, nearly as tall and heavily muscled as Wulfgar, broke rank and closed in to stand before him. The stranger wore a single braid in his long hair, running down the side of his face and over his shoulder. His cheeks were painted white in the image of wings. The hardness of his frame and disciplined set of his face reflected a life in the harsh wilderness, and were it not for the raven color of his hair, Wulfgar would have thought him to be of one of the tribes of Icewind Dale. The dark-haired man similarly recognized Wulfgar, but better versed in the overall structures of the societies in the northland, was not so perplexed by their similarities. \"You are of the dale,\" he said in a broken form of the common tongue. \"Beyond the mountains, where the cold wind blows.\" Wulfgar nodded. \"I am Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, of the Tribe of the Elk. We share gods, for I, too, call to Tempus for strength and courage.\" The dark-haired man looked around at the fallen orcs. \"The god answers your call, warrior of the dale.\" Wulfgar\u0027s jaw lifted in pride. \"We share hatred for the orcs, as well,\" he continued, \"but I know nothing of you or your people.\" \"You shall learn,\" the dark-haired man replied. He held out his hand and indicated the warhammer. Wulfgar straightened firmly, having no intentions of surrendering, no matter the odds. The dark-haired man looked to the side, drawing Wulfgar\u0027s eyes with his own. Two warriors had picked up Bruenor and Regis and slung them over their backs, while others had recaptured the horses and were leading them in. \"The weapon,\" the dark-haired man demanded. \"You are in our land without our say, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar. The price of that crime is death. Shall you watch our judgement over your small friends?\" The younger Wulfgar would have struck then, damning them all in a blaze of glorious fury. But Wulfgar had learned much from his new friends, Drizzt in particular. He knew that Aegis-fang would return to his call, and he knew, too, that Drizzt would not abandon them. This was not the time to fight. He even let them bind his hands, an act of dishonor that no warrior of the Tribe of the Elk would ever allow. But Wulfgar had faith in Drizzt. His hands would be freed again. Then he would have the last word. By the time they reached the barbarian camp, both Regis and Bruenor had regained consciousness and were bound and walking beside their barbarian friend. Dried blood crusted Bruenor\u0027s hair and he had lost his helm, but his dwarven toughness had carried him through another encounter that should have finished him. They crested a rise and came upon the perimeter of a ring of tents and blazing campfires. Whooping their war cries to Tempus, the returning war party roused the camp, tossing severed orc heads into the ring to announce their glorious arrival. The fervor inside the camp soon matched the level of the entering war party, and the three prisoners were pushed in first, to be greeted by a score of howling barbarians. \"What do they eat?\" Bruenor asked, more in sarcasm than concern. \"Whatever it is, feed them quickly,\" Regis replied, drawing a clap on the back of his head and a warning to be silent from the guard behind him. The prisoners and horses were herded into the center of the camp and the tribe encircled them in a victory dance, kicking orc heads around in the dust and singing out, in a language unknown to the companions, their praise to Tempus and to Uthgar, their ancestral hero, for the success this night. It went on for nearly an hour, and then, all at once, it ended and every face in the ring turned to the closed flap of a large and decorated tent. The silence held for a long moment before the flap swung open. Out jumped an ancient man, as slender as a tent pole, but showing more energy than his obvious years would indicate. His face painted in the same markings as the warriors, though more elaborately, he wore a patch with a huge green gemstone sewn upon it over one eye. His robe was the purest white, its sleeves showing as feathered wings whenever he flapped his arms out to the side. He danced and twirled through the ranks of the warriors, and each held his breath, recoiling until he had passed. \"Chief?\" Bruenor whispered. \"Shaman,\" corrected Wulfgar, more knowledgeable in the ways of tribal life. The respect the warriors showed this man came from a fear beyond what a mortal enemy, even a chieftain, could impart. The shaman spun and leaped, landing right before the three prisoners. He looked at Bruenor and Regis for just a moment, then turned his full attention upon Wulfgar. \"I am Valric High Eye,\" he screeched suddenly. \"Priest of the followers of the Sky Ponies! The children of Uthgar!\" \"Uthgar!\" echoed the warriors, clapping their hatchets against their wooden shields. Wulfgar waited for the commotion to die away, then presented himself. \"I am Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, of the Tribe of the Elk.\" \"And I\u0027m Bruenor - \" began the dwarf. \"Silence!\" Valric shouted at him, trembling with rage. \"I care nothing for you!\" Bruenor closed his mouth and entertained dreams concerning his axe and Valric\u0027s head. \"We meant no harm, nor trespass,\" Wulfgar began, but Valric put his hand up, cutting him short. \"Your purpose does not interest me,\" he explained calmly, but his excitement resurged at once. \"Tempus has delivered you unto us, that is all! A worthy warrior?\" He looked around at his own men and their response showed eagerness for the coming challenge. \"How many did you claim?\" he asked Wulfgar. \"Seven fell before me,\" the young barbarian replied proudly. Valric nodded in approval. \"Tall and strong,\" he commented. \"Let us discover if Tempus is with you. Let us judge if you are worthy to run with the Sky Ponies!\" Shouts started at once and two warriors rushed over to unbind Wulfgar. A third, the leader of the war party who had spoken to Wulfgar at the copse of trees, tossed down his hatchet and shield and stormed into the ring. Drizzt waited in his tree until the last of the war party had given up the search for the rider of the fourth horse and departed. Then the drow moved quickly, gathering together some of the dropped items: the dwarf\u0027s axe and Regis\u0027s mace. He had to pause and steady himself when he found Bruenor\u0027s helm, though, blood-stained and newly dented, and with one of its horns broken away. Had his friend survived? He shoved the broken helm into his sack and slipped out after the troupe, keeping a cautious distance. Relief flooded through him when he came upon the camp and spotted his three friends, Bruenor standing calmly between Wulfgar and Regis. Satisfied, Drizzt put aside his emotions and all thoughts of the previous encounter, narrowing his vision to the situation before him, formulating a plan of attack that would free his friends. The dark-haired man held his open hands out to Wulfgar, inviting his blond counterpart to clasp them. Wulfgar had never seen this particular challenge before, but it was not so different from the tests of strength that his own people practised. \"Your feet do not move!\" instructed Valric. \"This is the challenge of strength! Let Tempus show us your worth!\" Wulfgar\u0027s firm visage didn\u0027t reveal a hint of his confidence that he could defeat any man at such a test. He brought his hands up level with those of his opponent. The man grabbed at them angrily, snarling at the large foreigner. Almost immediately, before Wulfgar had even straightened his grip or set his feet, the shaman screamed out to begin, and the dark-haired man drove his hands forward, bending Wulfgar\u0027s back over his wrists. Shouting erupted from every corner of the encampment; the dark-haired man roared and pushed with all his strength, but as soon as the moment of surprise had passed, Wulfgar fought back. The iron-corded muscles in Wulfgar\u0027s neck and shoulders snapped taut and his huge arms reddened with the forced surge of blood into their veins. Tempus had blessed him truly; even his mighty opponent could only gape in amazement at the spectacle of his power. Wulfgar looked him straight in the eye and matched the snarl with a determined glare that foretold the inevitable victory. Then the son of Beornegar drove forward, stopping the dark-haired man\u0027s initial momentum and forcing his own hands back into a more normal angle with his wrists. Once he had regained parity, Wulfgar realized that one sudden push would put his opponent into the same disadvantage that he had just escaped. From there, the dark-haired man would have little chance of holding on. But Wulfgar wasn\u0027t anxious to end this contest. He didn\u0027t want to humiliate his opponent - that would breed only an enemy - and even more importantly, he knew that Drizzt was about. The longer he could keep the contest going, and the eyes of every member of the tribe fixed upon him, the longer Drizzt would have to put some plan into motion. The two men held there for many seconds, and Wulfgar couldn\u0027t help but smile when he noticed a dark shape slip in among the horses, behind the enthralled guards at the other end of the camp. Whether it was his imagination, he could not tell, but he thought that he saw two points of lavender flame staring out at him from the darkness. A few seconds more, he decided, though he knew that he was taking a chance by not finishing the challenge. The shaman could declare a draw if they held for too long. But then it was over. The veins and sinews in Wulfgar\u0027s arms bulged and his shoulders lifted even higher. \"Tempus!\" he growled, praising the god for yet another victory, and then with a sudden, ferocious explosion of power, he drove the dark-haired man to his knees. All around, the camp went silent, even the shaman being stricken speechless by the display. Two guards moved tentatively to Wulfgar\u0027s side. The beaten warrior pulled himself to his feet and stood facing Wulfgar. No hints of anger marred his face, just honest admiration, for the Sky Ponies were an honorable people. \"We would welcome you,\" Valric said. \"You have defeated Torlin, son of Jerek Wolf-slayer, Chieftain of the Sky Ponies. Never before has Torlin been bested!\" \"What of my friends?\" Wulfgar asked. \"I care nothing for them!\" Valric snapped back. \"The dwarf will be set free on a trail leading from our land. We have no quarrel with him or his kind, nor do we desire any dealings with them!\" The shaman eyed Wulfgar slyly. \"The other is a weakling,\" he stated. \"He shall serve as your passage to the tribe, your sacrifice to the winged horse.\" Wulfgar did not immediately respond. They had tested his strength, and now were testing his loyalties. The Sky Ponies had paid him their highest honor in offering him a place in their tribe, but only on condition that he show his allegiance beyond any doubt. Wulfgar thought of his own people, and the way they had lived for so many centuries on the tundra. Even in this day, many of the barbarians of Icewind Dale would have accepted the terms and killed Regis, considering the life of a halfling a small price for such an honor. This was the disillusionment of Wulfgar\u0027s existence with his people, the facet of their moral code that had proved unacceptable to his personal standards. \"No,\" he replied to Valric without blinking. \"He is a weakling!\" Valric reasoned. \"Only the strong deserve life!\" \"His fate is not mine to decide,\" Wulfgar replied. \"Nor yours.\" Valric motioned to the two guards and they immediately rebound Wulfgar\u0027s hands. \"A loss for our people,\" Torlin said to Wulfgar. \"You would have received a place of honor among us.\" Wulfgar didn\u0027t answer, holding Torlin\u0027s stare for a long moment, sharing respect and also the mutual understanding that their codes were too different for such a joining. In a shared fantasy that could not be, both imagined fighting beside the other, felling orcs by the score and inspiring the bards to a new legend. It was time for Drizzt to strike. The drow had paused by the horses to view the outcome of the contest and also to better measure his enemies. He planned his attack for effect more than for damage, wanting to put on a grand show to cow a tribe of fearless warriors long enough for his friends to break free of the ring. No doubt, the barbarians had heard of the dark elves. And no doubt, the tales they had heard were terrifying. Silently, Drizzt tied the two ponies behind the horses, then mounted the horses, a foot in one stirrup on each. Rising between them, he stood tall and threw back the cowl of his cloak. The dangerous glow in his lavender eyes sparkling wildly, he bolted the mounts into the ring, scattering the stunned barbarians closest to him. Howls of rage rose up from the surprised tribesmen, the tone of the shouts shifting to one of terror when they viewed the black skin. Torlin and Valric turned to face the oncoming menace, though even they did not know how to deal with a legend personified. And Drizzt had a trick ready for them. With a wave of his black hand, purple flames spouted from Torlin and Valric\u0027s skin, not burning, but casting both the superstitious tribesmen into a horrified frenzy. Torlin dropped to his knees, clasping his arms in disbelief, while the highstrung shaman dove to the ground and began rolling in the dirt. Wulfgar took his cue. Another surge of power through his arms snapped the leather bonds at his wrists. He continued the momentum of his hands, swinging them upward, catching both of the guards beside him squarely in the face and dropping them to their backs. Bruenor also understood his part. He stomped heavily onto the instep of the lone barbarian standing between him and Regis, and when the man crouched to grasp his pained foot, Bruenor butted him in the head. The man tumbled as easily as Whisper had back in Rat Alley in Luskan. \"Huh, works as well without the helmet!\" Bruenor marveled. \"Only for a dwarf\u0027s head!\" Regis remarked as Wulfgar grabbed both of them by the back of their collars and hoisted them easily onto the ponies. He was up then, too, beside Drizzt, and they charged through the other side of the camp. It had all happened too quickly for any of the barbarians to ready a weapon or form any kind of defense. Drizzt wheeled his horse behind the ponies to protect the rear. \"Ride!\" he yelled to his friends, slapping their mounts on the rump with the flat of his scimitars. The other three shouted in victory as though their escape was complete, but Drizzt knew that this had been the easy part. The dawn was fast approaching, and in this up-and-down, unfamiliar terrain, the native barbarians could easily catch them. The companions charged into the silence of pre-dawn, picking the straightest and easiest path to gain as much ground as possible. Drizzt still kept an eye behind them, expecting the tribesmen to be fast on their trail. But the commotion in the camp had died away almost immediately after the escape, and the drow saw no signs of pursuit. Now only a single call could be heard, the rhythmic singing of Valric in a tongue that none of the travelers understood. The look of dread on Wulfgar\u0027s face made all of them pause. \"The powers of a shaman,\" the barbarian explained. Back in the camp, Valric stood alone with Torlin inside the ring of his people, chanting and dancing through the ultimate ritual of his station, summoning the power of his tribe\u0027s Spiritual Beast. The appearance of the drow elf had completely unnerved the shaman. He stopped any pursuit before it had even begun and ran to his tent for the sacred leather satchel needed for the ritual, deciding that the spirit of the winged horse, the Pegasus, should deal with these intruders. Valric targeted Torlin as the recipient of the spirit\u0027s form, and the son of Jerek awaited the possession with stoic dignity, hating the act, for it stripped him of his identity, but resigned to absolute obedience to his shaman. From the moment it began, however, Valric knew that in his excitement, he had overstepped the urgency of the summoning. Torlin shrieked and dropped to the ground, writhing in agony. A gray cloud surrounded him, its swirling vapors molding with his form, reshaping his features. His face puffed and twisted, and suddenly spurted outward into the semblance of a horse\u0027s head. His torso, as well, transmuted into something not human. Valric had meant only to impart some of the strengths of the spirit of the Pegasus in Torlin, but the entity itself had come, possessing the man wholly and bending his body into its own likeness. Torlin was consumed. In his place loomed the ghostly form of the winged horse. All in the tribe fell to their knees before it, even Valric, who could not face the image of the Spiritual Beast. But the Pegasus knew the shaman\u0027s thoughts and understood its children\u0027s needs. Smoke fumed from the spirit\u0027s nostrils and it rose into the air in pursuit of the escaping intruders. The friends had settled their mounts into a more comfortable, though still swift, pace. Free of their bonds, with the dawn breaking before them and no apparent pursuit behind them, they had eased up a bit. Bruenor fiddled with his helmet, trying to push the latest dent out far enough for him to get the thing back on his head. Even Wulfgar, so shaken a short time before when he had heard the chanting of the shaman, began to relax. Only Drizzt, ever wary, was not so easily convinced of their escape. And it was the drow who first sensed the approach of danger. In the dark cities, the black elves often dealt with otherworldly beings, and over the many centuries they had bred into their race a sensitivity for the magical emanations of such creatures. Drizzt stopped his horse suddenly and wheeled about. \"What do ye hear?\" Bruenor asked him. \"I hear nothing,\" Drizzt answered, his eyes darting about for some sign. \"But something is there.\" Before they could respond, the gray cloud rushed down from the sky and was upon them. Their horses bucked and reared in uncontrollable terror and in the confusion none of the friends could sort out what was happening. The Pegasus then formed right in front of Regis and the halfling felt a deathly chill penetrate his bones. He screamed and dropped from his mount. Bruenor, riding beside Regis, charged the ghostly form fearlessly. But his descending axe found only a cloud of smoke where the apparition had been. Then, just as suddenly, the ghost was back, and Bruenor, too, felt the icy cold of its touch. Tougher than the halfling, he managed to hold to his pony. \"What?\" he cried out vainly to Drizzt and Wulfgar. Aegis-fang whistled past him and continued on at the target. But the Pegasus was only smoke again and the magical warhammer passed unhindered through the swirling cloud. In an instant, the spirit was back, swooping down upon Bruenor. The dwarf\u0027s pony spun down to the ground in a frantic effort to scramble away from the thing. \"You cannot hit it!\" Drizzt called after Wulfgar, who went rushing to the dwarf\u0027s aid. \"It does not exist fully on this plane!\" Wulfgar\u0027s mighty legs locked his terrified horse straight and he struck as soon as Aegis-fang returned to his hands. But again he found only smoke, before his blow. \"Then how?\" he yelled to Drizzt, his eyes darting around to spot the first signs of the reforming spirit. Drizzt searched his mind for answers. Regis was still down, lying pale and unmoving on the field, and Bruenor, though he had not been too badly injured in his pony\u0027s fall, appeared dazed and shivering from the chill of unearthly cold. Drizzt grasped at a desperate plan. He pulled the onyx statue of the panther from his pouch and called for Guenhwyvar. The ghost returned, attacking with renewed fury. It descended upon Bruenor first, mantling the dwarf with its cold wings. \"Damn ye back to the Abyss!\" Bruenor roared in brave defiance. Rushing in, Wulfgar lost all sight of the dwarf, except for the head of his axe bursting harmlessly through the smoke. Then the barbarian\u0027s mount halted in its tracks, refusing, against all efforts, to move any closer to the unnatural beast. Wulfgar leaped from his saddle and charged in, crashing right through the cloud before the ghost could reform, his momentum carrying both him and Bruenor out the other side of the smoky mantle. They rolled away and looked back, only to find that the ghost had disappeared altogether again. Bruenor\u0027s eyelids drooped heavily and his skin held a ghastly hue of blue, and for the first time in his life, his indomitable spirit had no gumption for the fight. Wulfgar, too, had suffered the icy touch in his pass through the ghost, but he was still more than ready for another round with the thing. \"We can\u0027t fight it!\" Bruenor gasped through his chattering teeth. \"Here for a strike, it is, but gone when we hit back!\" Wulfgar shook his head defiantly. \"There is a way!\" he demanded, though he had to concede the dwarf\u0027s point. \"But my hammer cannot destroy clouds!\" Guenhwyvar appeared beside its master and crouched low, seeking the nemesis that threatened the drow. Drizzt understood the cat\u0027s intentions. \"No!\" he commanded. \"Not here.\" The drow had recalled something that Guenhwyvar had done several months earlier. To save Regis from the falling stone of a crumbling tower, Guenhwyvar had taken the halfling on a journey through the planes of existence. Drizzt grabbed onto the panther\u0027s thick coat. \"Take me to the land of the ghost,\" he instructed. \"To its own plane, where my weapons will bite deeply into its substantial being.\" The ghost appeared again as Drizzt and the cat faded into their own cloud. \"Keep swinging!\" Bruenor told his companion. \"Keep it as smoke so\u0027s it can\u0027t get at ye!\" \"Drizzt and the cat have gone!\" Wulfgar cried. \"To the land of the ghost,\" Bruenor explained. It took Drizzt a long moment to set his bearings. He had come into a place of different realities, a dimension where everything, even his own skin, assumed the same hue of gray, objects being distinguishable only by a thin waver of black that outlined them. His depth perception was useless, for there were no shadings, and no discernible light sources to use as a guide. And he found no footing, nothing tangible beneath him, nor could he even know which way was up or down. Such concepts didn\u0027t seem to fit here. He did make out the shifting outlines of the Pegasus as it jumped between planes, never fully in one place or the other. He tried to approach it and found propulsion to be an act of the mind, his body automatically following the instructions of his will. He stopped before the shifting lines, his magical scimitar poised to strike when the target fully appeared. Then the outline of the Pegasus was complete and Drizzt plunged his blade into the black waver that marked its form. The line shifted and bent, and the outline of the scimitar shivered as well, for here even the properties of the steel blade took on a different composition. But the steel proved the stronger and the scimitar resumed its curved edge and punctured the line of the ghost. There came a sudden tingling in the grayness, as though Drizzt\u0027s cut had disturbed the equilibrium of the plane, and the ghost\u0027s line trembled in a shiver of agony. Wulfgar saw the smoke cloud puff suddenly, almost reforming into the ghost shape. \"Drizzt!\" he called out to Bruenor. \"He has met the ghost on even terms!\" \"Get ye ready, then!\" Bruenor replied anxiously, though he knew that his own part in the fight had ended. \"The drow might bring it back to ye long enough for a hit!\" Bruenor clutched at his sides, trying to hug the deathly cold out of his bones, and stumbled over to the halfling\u0027s unmoving form. The ghost turned on Drizzt, but the scimitar struck again. And Guenhwyvar jumped into the fray, the cat\u0027s great claws tearing into the black outline of its enemy. The Pegasus reeled away from them, understanding that it held no advantage against foes on its own plane. Its only recourse was a retreat back to the material plane. Where Wulfgar waited. As soon as the cloud resumed its shape, Aegis-fang hammered into it. Wulfgar felt a solid strike for just a moment, and knew that he had hit his mark. Then the smoke blew away before him. The ghost was back with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, again facing their relentless stabs and rakes. It shifted back again, and Wulfgar struck quickly. Trapped with no retreat, the ghost took hits from both planes. Every time it materialized before Drizzt, the drow noted that its outline came thinner and less resistant to his thrusts. And every time the cloud reformed before Wulfgar, its density had diminished. The friends had won, and Drizzt watched in satisfaction as the essence of the Pegasus slipped free of the material form and floated away through the grayness. \"Take me home,\" the weary drow instructed Guenhwyvar. A moment later, he was back on the field beside Bruenor and Regis. \"He\u0027ll live,\" Bruenor stated flatly at Drizzt\u0027s inquiring look. \"More to faintin\u0027 than to dying\u0027d be me guess.\" A short distance away, Wulfgar, too, was hunched over a form, broken and twisted and caught in a transformation somewhere between man and beast. \"Torlin, son of Jerek,\" Wulfgar explained. He lifted his gaze back toward the barbarian camp. \"Valric is has done this. The blood of Torlin soils his hands!\" \"Torlin\u0027s own choice, perhaps?\" Drizzt offered. \"Never!\" Wulfgar insisted. \"When we met in challenge, my eyes looked upon honor. He was a warrior. He would never have allowed this!\" He stepped away from the corpse, letting its mutilated remains emphasize the horror of the possession. In the frozen pose of death, Torlin\u0027s face had retained half the features of a man, and half of the equine ghost. \"He was the son of their chieftain,\" Wulfgar explained. \"He could not refuse the demands of the shaman.\" \"He was brave to accept such a fate,\" Drizzt remarked. \"Son of their chieftain?\" snorted Bruenor. \"Seems we\u0027ve put even more enemies on the road behind us! They\u0027ll be looking to settle this score.\" \"As will I!\" Wulfgar proclaimed. \"His blood is yours to carry, Valric High Eye!\" he shouted into the distance, his calls echoing around the mounds of the crags. Wulfgar looked back to his friends, rage seething in his features, as he declared grimly, \"I shall avenge Torlin\u0027s dishonor.\" Bruenor nodded his approval at the barbarian\u0027s dedication to his principles. \"An honorable task,\" Drizzt agreed, holding his blade out to the east, toward Longsaddle, the next stop along their journey. \"But one for another day.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/streams-of-silver-the-icewind-dale-trilogy-2/page-7.html","bookId":2103,"book":{"id":2103,"title":"Streams of Silver (The Icewind Dale Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: Streams of Silver( The Icewind Dale Trilogy 2) The epic tale of everyone\u0027s favorite dark elf, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, reaches new heights!
