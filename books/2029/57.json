{"id":108476,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"Ian glared down at the three of us with such fury that Sunny shivered in terror. It was an odd thing-as if Kyle and Ian had switched faces. Except Ian\u0027s face was still perfect, unbroken. Beautiful, even though it was enraged.\n \"Ian?\" Kyle asked, bewildered. \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n Ian spoke from between his locked teeth. \"Wanda,\" he growled, and held his hand out. It looked as if he was having a hard time keeping that hand open, not clenching it into a fist.\n Uh-oh, Mel thought.\n Misery swept through me. I didn\u0027t want to say goodbye to Ian, and now I would have to. Of course I had to. I would be wrong to sneak out in the night like a thief and leave all my goodbyes to Melanie.\n Ian, tired of waiting, grabbed my arm and hauled me up from the floor. When Sunny seemed like she was coming along, too, still joined to my side, Ian shook me until she fell off.\n \"What is with you?\" Kyle demanded.\n Ian hauled his knee back and smashed his foot hard into Kyle\u0027s face.\n \"Ian!\" I protested.\n Sunny threw herself in front of Kyle-who was holding his hand to his nose and struggling to get to his feet-and tried to shield him with her tiny body. This knocked him off balance, back to the floor, and he groaned.\n \"C\u0027mon,\" Ian snarled, dragging me away from them without a backward glance.\n \"Ian -\"\n He wrenched me roughly along, making it impossible for me to speak. That was fine. I had no idea what to say.\n I saw everyone\u0027s startled face flash by in a blur. I was worried he was going to upset the unnamed woman. She wasn\u0027t used to anger and violence.\n And then we jerked to a stop. Jared was blocking the exit.\n \"Have you lost your mind, Ian?\" he asked, shocked and outraged. \"What are you doing to her?\"\n \"Did you know about this?\" Ian shouted back, shoving me toward Jared and shaking me at him. Behind us, a whimper. He was scaring them.\n \"You\u0027re going to hurt her!\"\n \"Do you know what she\u0027s planning?\" Ian roared.\n Jared stared at Ian, his face suddenly closed off. He didn\u0027t answer.\n That was answer enough for Ian.\n Ian\u0027s fist struck Jared so fast that I missed the blow-I just felt the lurch in his body and saw Jared reel back into the dark hall.\n \"Ian, stop,\" I begged.\n \"You stop,\" he growled back at me.\n He yanked me through the arch into the tunnel, then pulled me north. I had to almost run to keep up with his longer stride.\n \"O\u0027Shea!\" Jared shouted after us.\n \"I\u0027m going to hurt her?\" Ian roared back over his shoulder, not breaking pace. \"I am? You hypocritical swine!\"\n There was nothing but silence and blackness behind us now. I stumbled in the dark, trying to keep up.\n It was then that I began to feel the throbbing from Ian\u0027s grip. His hand was tight as a tourniquet around my upper arm, his long fingers making the circle easily and then overlapping. My hand was going numb.\n He jerked me along faster, and my breath caught in a moan, almost a cry of pain.\n The sound made Ian stumble to a stop. His breathing was hoarse in the darkness.\n \"Ian, Ian, I...\" I choked, unable to finish. I didn\u0027t know what to say, picturing his furious face.\n His arms caught me up abruptly, yanking my feet out from under me and then catching my shoulders before I could fall. He started running forward again, carrying me now. His hands were not rough and angry like before; he cradled me against his chest.\n He ran right through the big plaza, ignoring the surprised and even suspicious faces. There was too much that was unfamiliar and uncomfortable going on in the caves right now. The humans here-Violetta, Geoffrey, Andy, Paige, Aaron, Brandt, and more I couldn\u0027t see well as we jolted past-were skittish. It disturbed them to see Ian running headlong through them, face twisted with rage, with me in his arms.\n And then they were behind us. He didn\u0027t pause until we reached the doors leaning against his and Kyle\u0027s room. He kicked the red one out of the way-it hit the stone floor with an echoing boom-and dropped me onto the mattress on the floor.\n Ian stood above me, his chest heaving with exertion and fury. For a second he turned away and put the door back in place with one swift wrench. And then he was glowering again.\n I took a deep breath and rolled up onto my knees, holding my hands out, palms up, wishing that some magic would appear in them. Something I could give him, something I could say. But my hands were empty.\n \"You. Are. Not. Leaving. Me.\" His eyes blazed-burning brighter than I had ever seen them, blue flames.\n \"Ian,\" I whispered. \"You have to see that... that I can\u0027t stay. You must see that.\"\n \"No!\" he shouted at me.\n I cringed back, and, abruptly, Ian crumpled forward, falling to his knees, falling into me. He buried his head in my stomach, and his arms locked around my waist. He was shaking, shaking hard, and loud, desperate sobs were breaking out of his chest.\n \"No, Ian, no,\" I begged. This was so much worse than his anger. \"Don\u0027t, please. Please, don\u0027t.\"\n \"Wanda,\" he moaned.\n \"Ian, please. Don\u0027t feel this way. Don\u0027t. I\u0027m so sorry. Please.\"\n I was crying, too, shaking, too, though that might have been him shaking me.\n \"You can\u0027t leave.\"\n \"I have to, I have to,\" I sobbed.\n And then we cried wordlessly for a long time.\n His tears dried before mine. Eventually, he straightened up and pulled me into his arms again. He waited until I was able to speak.\n \"Sorry,\" he whispered. \"I was mean.\"\n \"No, no. I\u0027m sorry. I should have told you, when you didn\u0027t guess. I just... I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t want to tell you-to hurt you-to hurt me. It was selfish.\"\n \"We need to talk about this, Wanda. It\u0027s not a done deal. It can\u0027t be.\"\n \"It is.\"\n He shook his head, clenching his teeth. \"How long? How long have you been planning this?\"\n \"Since the Seeker,\" I whispered.\n He nodded, seeming to expect this answer. \"And you thought that you had to give up your secret to save her. I can understand that. But that doesn\u0027t mean you have to go anywhere. Just because Doc knows now... that doesn\u0027t mean anything. If I\u0027d thought for one minute that it did, that one action equaled the other, I wouldn\u0027t have stood there and let you show him. No one is going to force you to lie down on his blasted gurney! I\u0027ll break his hands if he tries to touch you!\"\n \"Ian, please.\"\n \"They can\u0027t make you, Wanda! Do you hear me?\" He was shouting again.\n \"No one is making me. I didn\u0027t show Doc how to do the separation so that I could save the Seeker,\" I whispered. \"The Seeker\u0027s being here just made me have to decide... faster. I did it to save Mel, Ian.\"\n His nostrils flared, and he said nothing.\n \"She\u0027s trapped in here, Ian. It\u0027s like a prison-worse than that; I can\u0027t even describe it. She\u0027s like a ghost. And I can free her. I can give her herself back.\"\n \"You deserve a life, too, Wanda. You deserve to stay.\"\n \"But I love her, Ian.\"\n He closed his eyes, and his pale lips went dead white.\n \"But I love you,\" he whispered. \"Doesn\u0027t that matter?\"\n \"Of course it matters. So much. Can\u0027t you see? That only makes it more... necessary.\"\n His eyes flashed open. \"Is it so unbearable to have me love you? Is that it? I can keep my mouth shut, Wanda. I won\u0027t say it again. You can be with Jared, if that\u0027s what you want. Just stay.\"\n \"No, Ian!\" I took his face between my hands-his skin felt hard, strained tight over the bones. \"No. I-I love you, too. Me, the little silver worm in the back of her head. But my body doesn\u0027t love you. It can\u0027t love you. I can never love you in this body, Ian. It pulls me in two. It\u0027s unbearable.\"\n I could have borne it. But watching him suffer because of my body\u0027s limitations? Not that.\n He closed his eyes again. His thick black lashes were wet with tears. I could see them glisten.\n Oh, go ahead, Mel sighed. Do whatever you need to. I\u0027ll... step into the other room, she added dryly.\n Thanks.\n I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled myself closer to him until my lips touched his.\n He curled his arms around me, pulling me tighter against his chest. Our lips moved together, fusing as if they would never divide, as if separation was not the inevitable thing it was, and I could taste the salt of our tears. His and mine.\n Something began to change.\n When Melanie\u0027s body touched Jared\u0027s body, it was like a wildfire-a fast burn that raced across the surface of the desert and consumed everything in its path.\n With Ian it was different, so very different, because Melanie didn\u0027t love him the way I did. So when he touched me, it was deeper and slower than the wildfire, like the flow of molten rock far beneath the surface of the earth. Too deep to feel the heat of it, but it moved inexorably, changing the very foundations of the world with its advance.\n My unwilling body was a fog between us-a thick curtain, but gauzy enough that I could see through it, could see what was happening.\n It changed me, not her. It was almost a metallurgical process deep inside the core of who I was, something that had already begun, was already nearly forged. But this long, unbroken kiss finished it, searing and sharp edged-it shoved this new creation, all hissing, into the cold water that made it hard and final. Unbreakable.\n And I started to cry again, realizing that it must be changing him, too, this man who was kind enough to be a soul but strong as only a human could be.\n He moved his lips to my eyes, but it was too late. It was done. \"Don\u0027t cry, Wanda. Don\u0027t cry. You\u0027re staying with me.\"\n \"Eight full lives,\" I whispered against his jaw, my voice breaking. \"Eight full lives and I never found anyone I would stay on a planet for, anyone I would follow when they left. I never found a partner. Why now? Why you? You\u0027re not of my species. How can you be my partner?\"\n \"It\u0027s a strange universe,\" he murmured.\n \"It\u0027s not fair,\" I complained, echoing Sunny\u0027s words. It wasn\u0027t fair. How could I find this, find love-now, in this eleventh hour-and have to leave it? Was it fair that my soul and body couldn\u0027t reconcile? Was it fair that I had to love Melanie, too?\n Was it fair that Ian would suffer? He deserved happiness if anyone did. It wasn\u0027t fair or right or even... sane. How could I do this to him?\n \"I love you,\" I whispered.\n \"Don\u0027t say that like you\u0027re saying goodbye.\"\n But I had to. \"I, the soul called Wanderer, love you, human Ian. And that will never change, no matter what I might become.\" I worded it carefully, so that there would be no lie in my voice. \"If I were a Dolphin or a Bear or a Flower, it wouldn\u0027t matter. I would always love you, always remember you. You will be my only partner.\"\n His arms stiffened, then constricted tighter around me, and I could feel the anger in them again. It was hard to breathe.\n \"You\u0027re not wandering off anywhere. You\u0027re staying here.\"\n \"Ian -\"\n But his voice was brusque now-angry, but also businesslike. \"This isn\u0027t just for me. You\u0027re a part of this community, and you aren\u0027t getting kicked out without discussion. You are far too important to us all-even to the ones who would never admit it. We need you.\"\n \"No one\u0027s kicking me out, Ian.\"\n \"No. Not even you yourself, Wanderer.\"\n He kissed me again, his mouth rougher with the return of the anger. His hand curled into a fist around my hair, and he pulled my face an inch away from his.\n \"Good or bad?\" he demanded.\n \"Good.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I thought.\" And his voice was a growl.\n He kissed me again. His arms were so tight around my ribs, his mouth so fierce against mine, that I was soon dizzy and gasping for air. He loosened his arms a little then and let his lips slide to my ear.\n \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n \"Where? Where are we going?\" I wasn\u0027t going anywhere, I knew that. And yet how my heart pounded when I thought of going away, somewhere, anywhere, with Ian. My Ian. He was mine, the way Jared never would be. The way this body could never be his.\n \"Don\u0027t give me any trouble about this, Wanderer. I\u0027m half out of my mind.\" He pulled us both to our feet.\n \"Where?\" I insisted.\n \"You\u0027re going down the eastern tunnel, past the field, to the end.\"\n \"The game room?\"\n \"Yes. And then you are going to wait there until I get the rest of them.\"\n \"Why?\" His words sounded crazy to me. Did he want to play a game? To ease the tension again?\n \"Because this will be discussed. I\u0027m calling a tribunal, Wanderer, and you are going to abide by our decision.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-57.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
