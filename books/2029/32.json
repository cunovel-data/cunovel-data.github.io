{"id":108452,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"I froze and then looked quickly over my shoulder to see if someone was behind me. \"Gladys was his wife,\" Jamie whispered almost silently. \"She didn\u0027t escape.\" \"Gladys,\" Walter said to me, oblivious to my reaction. \"Would you believe I went and got cancer? What are the odds, eh? Never took a sick day in my life...\" His voice faded out until I couldn\u0027t hear it, but his lips continued to move. He was too weak to lift his hand; his fingers dragged themselves toward the edge of the cot, toward me. Ian nudged me forward. \"What should I do?\" I breathed. The sweat beading on my forehead had nothing to do with the humid heat. \"... grandfather lived to be a hundred and one,\" Walter wheezed, audible again. \"Nobody ever had cancer in my family, not even the cousins. Didn\u0027t your aunt Regan have skin cancer, though?\" He looked at me trustingly, waiting for an answer. Ian poked me in the back. \"Um...\" I mumbled. \"Maybe that was Bill\u0027s aunt,\" Walter allowed. I shot a panicked glance at Ian, who shrugged. \"Help,\" I mouthed at him. He motioned for me to take Walter\u0027s searching fingers. Walter\u0027s skin was chalk white and translucent. I could see the faint pulse of blood in the blue veins on the back of his hand. I lifted his hand gingerly, worried about the slender bones that Jamie had said were so brittle. It felt too light, as if it were hollow. \"Ah, Gladdie, it\u0027s been hard without you. It\u0027s a nice place here; you\u0027ll like it, even when I\u0027m gone. Plenty of people to talk to-I know how you need to have your conversation...\" The volume of his voice sank until I couldn\u0027t make out the words anymore, but his lips still shaped the words he wanted to share with his wife. His mouth kept moving, even when his eyes closed and his head lolled to the side. Ian found a wet cloth and began wiping Walter\u0027s shining face. \"I\u0027m not good at... at deception,\" I whispered, watching Walter\u0027s mumbling lips to make sure he wasn\u0027t listening to me. \"I don\u0027t want to upset him.\" \"You don\u0027t have to say anything,\" Ian reassured me. \"He\u0027s not lucid enough to care.\" \"Do I look like her?\" \"Not a bit-I\u0027ve seen her picture. Stocky redhead.\" \"Here, let me do that.\" Ian gave me the rag, and I cleaned the sweat off Walter\u0027s neck. Busy hands always made me feel more comfortable. Walter continued to mumble. I thought I heard him say, \"Thanks, Gladdie, that\u0027s nice.\" I didn\u0027t notice that Doc\u0027s snores had stopped. His familiar voice was suddenly there behind me, too gentle to startle. \"How is he?\" \"Delusional,\" Ian whispered. \"Is that the brandy or the pain?\" \"More the pain, I would think. I\u0027d trade my right arm for some morphine.\" \"Maybe Jared will produce another miracle,\" Ian suggested. \"Maybe,\" Doc sighed. I wiped absently at Walter\u0027s pallid face, listening more intently now, but they didn\u0027t speak of Jared again. Not here, Melanie whispered. Looking for help for Walter, I agreed. Alone, she added. I thought about the last time I\u0027d seen him-the kiss, the belief... He probably wanted some time to himself. I hope he isn\u0027t out there convincing himself that you\u0027re a very talented actress-slash-Seeker again... That\u0027s possible, of course. Melanie groaned silently. Ian and Doc murmured in quiet voices about inconsequential things, mostly Ian catching Doc up on what was going on in the caves. \"What happened to Wanda\u0027s face?\" Doc whispered, but I could still hear him easily. \"More of the same,\" Ian said in a tight voice. Doc made an unhappy noise under his breath and then clicked his tongue. Ian told him a bit about tonight\u0027s awkward class, about Geoffrey\u0027s questions. \"It would have been convenient if Melanie had been possessed by a Healer,\" Doc mused. I flinched, but they were behind me and probably didn\u0027t notice. \"We\u0027re lucky it was Wanda,\" Ian murmured in my defense. \"No one else -\" \"I know,\" Doc interrupted, good-natured as always. \"I guess I should say, it\u0027s too bad Wanda didn\u0027t have more of an interest in medicine.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I murmured. I was careless to reap the benefits of perfect health without ever being curious about the cause. A hand touched my shoulder. \"You have nothing to apologize for,\" Ian said. Jamie was being very quiet. I looked around and saw that he was curled up on the cot where Doc had been napping. \"It\u0027s late,\" Doc noted. \"Walter\u0027s not going anywhere tonight. You should get some sleep.\" \"We\u0027ll be back,\" Ian promised. \"Let us know what we can bring, for either of you.\" I laid Walter\u0027s hand down, patting it cautiously. His eyes snapped open, focusing with more awareness than before. \"Are you leaving?\" he wheezed. \"Do you have to go so soon?\" I took his hand again quickly. \"No, I don\u0027t have to leave.\" He smiled and closed his eyes again. His fingers locked around mine with brittle strength. Ian sighed. \"You can go,\" I told him. \"I don\u0027t mind. Take Jamie back to his bed.\" Ian glanced around the room. \"Hold on a sec,\" he said, and then he grabbed the cot closest to him. It wasn\u0027t heavy-he lifted it easily and slid it into place next to Walter\u0027s. I stretched my arm to the limit, trying not to jostle Walter, so that Ian could arrange the cot under it. Then he grabbed me up just as easily and set me on the cot beside Walter. Walter\u0027s eyes never fluttered. I gasped quietly, caught off guard by the casual way Ian was able to put his hands on me-as though I were human. Ian jerked his chin toward Walter\u0027s hand clasped around mine. \"Do you think you can sleep like that?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m sure I can.\" \"Sleep well, then.\" He smiled at me, then turned and lifted Jamie from the other cot. \"Let\u0027s go, kid,\" he muttered, carrying the boy with no more effort than if he were an infant. Ian\u0027s quiet footsteps faded into the distance until I couldn\u0027t hear them anymore. Doc yawned and went to sit behind the desk he\u0027d constructed out of wooden crates and an aluminum door, taking the dim lamp with him. Walter\u0027s face was too dark to see, and that made me nervous. It was like he was already gone. I took comfort in his fingers, still curled stiffly around mine. Doc began to shuffle through some papers, humming almost inaudibly to himself. I drifted off to the sound of the gentle rustling. Walter recognized me in the morning. He didn\u0027t wake until Ian showed up to escort me back; the cornfield was due to be cleared of the old stalks. I promised Doc I would bring him breakfast before I got to work. The very last thing I did was to carefully loosen my numb fingers, freeing them from Walter\u0027s grasp. His eyes opened. \"Wanda,\" he whispered. \"Walter?\" I wasn\u0027t sure how long he would know me, or if he would remember last night. His hand clutched at the empty air, so I gave him my left, the one that wasn\u0027t dead. \"You came to see me. That was nice. I know... with the others back... must be hard... for you... Your face...\" He seemed to be having a difficult time making his lips form the words, and his eyes went in and out of focus. How like him, that his first words to me would be full of concern. \"Everything\u0027s fine, Walter. How are you feeling?\" \"Ah -\" He groaned quietly. \"Not so... Doc?\" \"Right here,\" Doc murmured, close behind me. \"Got any more liquor?\" he gasped. \"Of course.\" Doc was already prepared. He held the mouth of a thick glass bottle to Walter\u0027s slack lips and carefully poured the dark brown liquid in slow drips into his mouth. Walter winced as each sip burned down his throat. Some of it trickled out the side of his mouth and onto his pillow. The smell stung my nose. \"Better?\" Doc asked after a long moment of slow pouring. Walter grunted. It didn\u0027t sound like assent. His eyes closed. \"More?\" Doc asked. Walter grimaced and then moaned. Doc cursed under his breath. \"Where\u0027s Jared?\" he muttered. I stiffened at the name. Melanie stirred and then drifted again. Walter\u0027s face sagged. His head rolled back on his neck. \"Walter?\" I whispered. \"The pain\u0027s too much for him to stay conscious. Let him be,\" Doc said. My throat felt swollen. \"What can I do?\" Doc\u0027s voice was desolate. \"About as much as I can. Which is nothing. I\u0027m useless.\" \"Don\u0027t be like that, Doc,\" I heard Ian murmur. \"This isn\u0027t your fault. The world doesn\u0027t work the way it used to. No one expects more of you.\" My shoulders hunched inward. No, their world didn\u0027t work the same way anymore. A finger tapped my arm. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Ian whispered. I nodded and started to pull my hand free again. Walter\u0027s eyes rolled open, unseeing. \"Gladdie? Are you here?\" he implored. \"Um... I\u0027m here,\" I said uncertainly, letting his fingers lock around mine. Ian shrugged. \"I\u0027ll get you both some food,\" he whispered, and then he left. I waited anxiously for him to return, unnerved by Walter\u0027s misconception. Walter murmured Gladys\u0027s name over and over, but he didn\u0027t seem to need anything from me, for which I was grateful. After a while, half an hour maybe, I began listening for Ian\u0027s footsteps in the tunnel, wondering what could be taking him so long. Doc stood by his desk the whole time, staring into nothing with his shoulders slumped. It was easy to see how useless he felt. And then I did hear something, but it wasn\u0027t footsteps. \"What is that?\" I asked Doc in a whisper; Walter was quiet again, maybe unconscious. I didn\u0027t want to disturb him. Doc turned to look at me, cocking his head to the side at the same time to listen. The noise was a funny thrumming, a fast, soft beat. I thought I heard it get just a little louder, but then it seemed quieter again. \"That\u0027s weird,\" Doc said. \"It almost sounds like...\" He paused, his forehead furrowing in concentration as the unfamiliar sound faded. We were listening intently, so we heard the footsteps when they were still far away. They did not match the expected, even pace of Ian\u0027s return. He was running-no, sprinting. Doc reacted immediately to the sound of trouble. He jogged quickly out to meet Ian. I wished I could see what was wrong, too, but I didn\u0027t want to upset Walter by trying to free my hand again. I listened hard instead. \"Brandt?\" I heard Doc say in surprise. \"Where is it? Where is it?\" the other man demanded breathlessly. The running footsteps only paused for a second, then started up again, not quite as fast. \"What are you talking about?\" Doc asked, calling back this way. \"The parasite!\" Brandt hissed impatiently, anxiously, as he burst through the arched entry. Brandt was not a big man like Kyle or Ian; he was probably only a few inches taller than me, but he was thick and solid as a rhinoceros. His eyes swept the room; his piercing gaze focused on my face for half a second, then took in Walter\u0027s oblivious form, and then raced around the room only to end up on me again. Doc caught up with Brandt then, his long fingers gripping Brandt\u0027s shoulder just as the broader man took the first step in my direction. \"What are you doing?\" Doc asked, his voice the closest to a growl I\u0027d ever heard it. Before Brandt answered, the odd sound returned, going from soft to screaming loud to soft again with a suddenness that had us all frozen. The beats thudded right on top of one another, shaking the air when they were at their loudest. \"Is that-is that a helicopter?\" Doc asked, whispering. \"Yes,\" Brandt whispered back. \"It\u0027s the Seeker-the one from before, the one who was looking for it.\" He jerked his chin at me. My throat was suddenly too small-the breaths moving through it were thin and shallow, not enough. I felt dizzy. No. Not now. Please. What is her problem? Mel snarled in my head. Why can\u0027t she leave us alone? We can\u0027t let her hurt them! But how do we stop her? I don\u0027t know. This is all my fault! Mine, too, Wanda. Ours. \"Are you sure?\" Doc asked. \"Kyle got a clear view through the binoculars while it was hovering. Same one he saw before.\" \"Is it looking here?\" Doc\u0027s voice was suddenly horrified. He half spun, eyes flashing toward the exit. \"Where\u0027s Sharon?\" Brandt shook his head. \"It\u0027s just running sweeps. Starts at Picacho, then fans out in spokes. Doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s focusing on anything close. Circled around a few times where we dumped the car.\" \"Sharon?\" Doc asked again. \"She\u0027s with the kids and Lucina. They\u0027re fine. The boys are getting things packed in case we have to roll tonight, but Jeb says it\u0027s not likely.\" Doc exhaled, then paced over to his desk. He slouched against it, looking as if he\u0027d just run a long race. \"So it\u0027s nothing new, really,\" he murmured. \"Naw. Just have to lay low for a few days,\" Brandt reassured him. His eyes were flickering around the room again, settling on me every other second. \"Do you have any rope handy?\" he asked. He pulled up the edge of the sheet on an empty cot, examining it. \"Rope?\" Doc echoed blankly. \"For the parasite. Kyle sent me out here to secure it.\" My muscles contracted involuntarily; my hand gripped Walter\u0027s fingers too tightly, and he whimpered. I tried to force it to relax while I kept my eyes on Brandt\u0027s hard face. He was waiting for Doc, expectant. \"You\u0027re here to secure Wanda?\" Doc said, his voice hard again. \"And what makes you think that\u0027s necessary?\" \"Come on, Doc. Don\u0027t be stupid. You\u0027ve got some big vents in here, and a lot of reflective metal.\" Brandt gestured to a file cabinet against the far wall. \"You let your attention wander for half a minute, and it\u0027ll be flashing signals to that Seeker.\" I sucked in a shocked breath; it was loud in the still room. \"See?\" Brandt said. \"Guessed its plan in one.\" I wanted to bury myself under a boulder to hide from the bulging, relentless eyes of my Seeker, yet he imagined I wanted to guide her in. Bring her here to kill Jamie, Jared, Jeb, Ian... I felt like gagging. \"You can go, Brandt,\" Doc said in an icy tone. \"I will keep an eye on Wanda.\" Brandt raised one eyebrow. \"What happened to you guys? To you and Ian and Trudy and the rest? It\u0027s like you\u0027re all hypnotized. If your eyes weren\u0027t right, I\u0027d have to wonder...\" \"Go ahead and wonder all you want, Brandt. But get out while you\u0027re doing it.\" Brandt shook his head. \"I\u0027ve got a job to do.\" Doc walked toward Brandt, stopping when he was between Brandt and me. He folded his arms across his chest. \"You\u0027re not going to touch her.\" The throbbing helicopter blades sounded in the distance. We were all very still, not breathing, until they faded. Brandt shook his head when it was quiet again. He didn\u0027t speak; he just went to the desk and picked up Doc\u0027s chair. He carried it to the wall by the file cabinet, slammed it to the ground, and then sat down hard, making the metal legs squeal against the stone. He leaned forward, his hands on his knees, and stared at me. A vulture waiting for a dying hare to stop moving. Doc\u0027s jaw tightened, making a little popping noise. \"Gladys,\" Walter muttered, surfacing from his dazed sleep. \"You\u0027re here.\" Too nervous to speak with Brandt watching, I just patted his hand. His clouded eyes searched my face, seeing features that weren\u0027t there. \"It hurts, Gladdie. It hurts a lot.\" \"I know,\" I whispered. \"Doc?\" He was already there, the brandy in hand. \"Open up, Walter.\" The sound of the helicopter thumped quietly, far away but still much too close. Doc flinched, and a few drops of brandy splattered on my arm. It was a horrible day. The worst of my life on this planet, even including my first day in the caves and the last hot, dry day in the desert, hours from death. The helicopter circled and circled. Sometimes more than an hour would pass, and I would think it was finally over. Then the sound would come back, and I would see the Seeker\u0027s obstinate face in my head, her protruding eyes scouring the blank desert for some sign of humans. I tried to will her away, concentrating hard on my memories of the desert\u0027s featureless, colorless plain, as if I could somehow make sure she saw nothing else, as if I could bore her into leaving. Brandt never took his suspicious stare off of me. I could always feel it, though I rarely looked at him. It got a little better when Ian came back with both breakfast and lunch. He was all dirty from packing in case of an evacuation-whatever that meant. Did they have anywhere to go? Ian scowled so hard he looked like Kyle when Brandt explained in clipped phrases why he was there. Then Ian dragged another empty cot beside mine, so that he could sit in Brandt\u0027s line of sight and block his view. The helicopter, Brandt\u0027s distrustful watch, these were not really so bad. On an ordinary day-if there was really such a thing anymore-either one of these might have seemed agonizing. Today, they were nothing. By noon, Doc had given Walter the last of the brandy. It seemed like only minutes later that Walter was writhing, moaning, and gasping for breath. His fingers bruised and chafed mine, but if I ever pulled away, his moans turned to shrill screams. I ducked out once to use the latrine; Brandt followed me, which made Ian feel like he had to come, too. By the time we got back-after nearly running the whole way-Walter\u0027s screams no longer sounded human. Doc\u0027s face was hollow with echoed agony. Walter quieted after I spoke to him for a moment, letting him think his wife was near. It was an easy lie, a kind one. Brandt made little noises of irritation, but I knew that he was wrong to be upset. Nothing mattered beside Walter\u0027s pain. The whimpers and the writhing continued, though, and Brandt paced back and forth at the other end of the room, trying to be as far from the sound as possible. Jamie came looking for me, bringing food enough for four, when the light was growing orangey overhead. I wouldn\u0027t let him stay; I made Ian take him back to the kitchen to eat, made Ian promise to watch him all night so he wouldn\u0027t sneak back here. Walter couldn\u0027t help shrieking when his twisting moved his broken leg, and the sound of it was nearly unbearable. Jamie shouldn\u0027t have this night burned into his memory the way it would surely be burned into Doc\u0027s and mine. Perhaps Brandt\u0027s as well, though he did what he could to ignore Walter, plugging his ears and humming a dissonant tune. Doc did not try to distance himself from Walter\u0027s hideous suffering; instead, he suffered with him. Walter\u0027s cries carved deep lines in Doc\u0027s face, like claws raking his skin. It was strange to see such depths of compassion in a human, particularly Doc. I couldn\u0027t look at him the same way after watching him live Walter\u0027s pain. So great was his compassion, he seemed to bleed internally with it. As I watched, it became impossible to believe that Doc was a cruel person; the man simply could not be a torturer. I tried to remember what had been said to found my conjectures-had anyone made the accusation outright? I didn\u0027t think so. I must have jumped to false conclusions in my terror. I doubted I could ever mistrust Doc again after this nightmarish day. However, I would always find his hospital a horrible place. When the last of the daylight disappeared, so did the helicopter. We sat in the darkness, not daring to turn on even the dim blue light. It took a few hours before any of us would believe the hunt was over. Brandt was the first to accept it; he\u0027d had enough of the hospital, too. \"Makes sense for it to give up,\" he muttered, edging out the exit. \"Nothing to see at night. I\u0027ll just take your light with me, Doc, so that Jeb\u0027s pet parasite can\u0027t get up to anything, and be on my way.\" Doc didn\u0027t respond, didn\u0027t even look at the sullen man as he left. \"Make it stop, Gladdie, make it stop!\" Walter begged me. I wiped the sweat from his face while he crushed my hand. Time seemed to slow down and stop; the black night felt unending. Walter\u0027s screams got more and more frequent, more and more excruciating. Melanie was far away, knowing she could do nothing useful. I would have hidden, too, if Walter hadn\u0027t needed me. I was all alone in my head-exactly what I had once wanted. It made me feel lost. Eventually, a dim gray light started to creep in through the high vents overhead. I was hovering on the edge of sleep, Walter\u0027s moans and screams keeping me from sinking under. I could hear Doc snoring behind me. I was glad that he\u0027d been able to escape for a little while. I didn\u0027t hear Jared come in. I was mumbling weak assurances, barely coherent, trying to calm Walter. \"I\u0027m here, I\u0027m here,\" I murmured as he cried out his wife\u0027s name. \"Shh, it\u0027s okay.\" The words were meaningless. It was something to say, though, and it did seem that my voice calmed the worst of his cries. I don\u0027t know how long Jared watched me with Walter before I realized he was there. It must have been a while. I was sure his first reaction would be anger, but when I heard him speak, his voice was cool. \"Doc,\" he said, and I heard the cot behind me shake. \"Doc, wake up.\" I jerked my hand free, whirling, disoriented, to see the face that went with the unmistakable voice. His eyes were on me as he shook the sleeping man\u0027s shoulder. They were impossible to read in the dim light. His face had no expression at all. Melanie jolted into awareness. She pored over his features, trying to read the thoughts behind the mask. \"Gladdie! Don\u0027t leave! Don\u0027t!\" Walter\u0027s screech had Doc bolting upright, nearly capsizing his cot. I spun back to Walter, shoving my sore hand into his searching fingers. \"Shhh, shhh! Walter, I\u0027m here. I won\u0027t leave. I won\u0027t, I promise.\" He quieted down, whimpering like a small child. I wiped the damp cloth over his forehead; his sob hitched and turned into a sigh. \"What\u0027s that about?\" Jared murmured behind me. \"She\u0027s the best painkiller I\u0027ve been able to find,\" Doc said wearily. \"Well, I\u0027ve found you something better than a tame Seeker.\" My stomach knotted, and Melanie hissed in my head. So stupidly, blindly stubborn! she growled. He wouldn\u0027t believe you if you told him the sun sets in the west. But Doc was beyond caring about the slight to me. \"You found something!\" \"Morphine-there\u0027s not much. I would have gotten here sooner if the Seeker hadn\u0027t pinned me down out there.\" Doc was instantly in action. I heard him rustling through something papery, and he crowed in delight. \"Jared, you\u0027re the miracle man!\" \"Doc, just a sec...\" But Doc was at my side already, his haggard face alight with anticipation. His hands were busy with a small syringe. He stuck the tiny needle into the crease at Walter\u0027s elbow, on the arm that was attached to me. I turned my face away. It seemed so horribly invasive to stab something through his skin. I couldn\u0027t argue with the results, though. Within half a minute, Walter\u0027s entire body relaxed, melting into a pile of loose flesh against the thin mattress. His breathing went from harsh and urgent to whispery and even. His hand relaxed, freeing mine. I massaged my left hand with my right, trying to bring the blood back to my fingertips. Little prickles followed the flow of blood under my skin. \"Uh, Doc, there really isn\u0027t enough for that,\" Jared murmured. I looked up from Walter\u0027s face, peaceful at last. Jared had his back to me, but I could see the surprise in Doc\u0027s expression. \"Enough for what? I\u0027m not going to save this for a rainy day, Jared. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll wish we had it again, and too soon, but I\u0027m not going to let Walter scream in agony while I have a way to help him!\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" Jared said. He spoke the way he did when he\u0027d already thought about something long and hard. Slow and even, like Walter\u0027s breath. Doc frowned, confused. \"There\u0027s enough to stop the pain for maybe three or four days, that\u0027s all,\" Jared said. \"If you give it to him in doses.\" I didn\u0027t understand what Jared was saying, but Doc did. \"Ah,\" he sighed. He turned to look at Walter again, and I saw a rim of fresh tears start to pool above his lower lids. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. I wanted to know what they were talking about, but Jared\u0027s presence made me silent, brought back the reserve I rarely felt the need for anymore. \"You can\u0027t save him. You can only save him pain, Doc.\" \"I know,\" Doc said. His voice broke, like he was holding back a sob. \"You\u0027re right.\" What\u0027s going on? I asked. As long as Melanie was going to be around, I might as well make use of her. They\u0027re going to kill Walter, she told me matter-of-factly. There\u0027s enough morphine to give him an overdose. My gasp sounded loud in the quiet room, but it was really just a breath. I didn\u0027t look up to see how the two healthy men would react. My own tears pooled as I leaned over Walter\u0027s pillow. No, I thought, no. Not yet. No. You\u0027d rather he died screaming? I just... I can\u0027t stand the... finality. It\u0027s so absolute. I\u0027ll never see my friend again. How many of your other friends have you gone back to visit, Wanderer? I\u0027ve never had friends like this before. My friends on other planets were all blurred together in my head; the souls were so similar, almost interchangeable in some ways. Walter was distinctly himself. When he was gone, there would be no one who could fill his place. I cradled Walter\u0027s head in my arms and let my tears fall onto his skin. I tried to stifle my crying, but it made its way out regardless, a keening rather than sobs. I know. Another first, Melanie whispered, and there was compassion in her tone. Compassion for me-that was a first, too. \"Wanda?\" Doc asked. I just shook my head, not able to answer. \"I think you\u0027ve been here too long,\" he said. I felt his hand, light and warm, on my shoulder. \"You should take a break.\" I shook my head again, still keening softly. \"You\u0027re worn out,\" he said. \"Go clean up, stretch your legs. Eat something.\" I glared up at him. \"Will Walter be here when I get back?\" I mumbled through my tears. His eyes tightened anxiously. \"Do you want that?\" \"I\u0027d like a chance to say goodbye. He\u0027s my friend.\" He patted my arm. \"I know, Wanda, I know. Me, too. I\u0027m in no hurry. You get some air and then come back. Walter will be sleeping for a while.\" I read his worn face, and I believed the sincerity there. I nodded and carefully put Walter\u0027s head back on the pillow. Maybe if I got away from this place for a little bit, I\u0027d find a way to handle this. I wasn\u0027t sure how-I had no experience with real goodbyes. Because I was in love with him, no matter that it was unwilling, I had to look at Jared before I left. Mel wanted this, too, but wished that she could somehow exclude me from the process. He was staring at me. I had a feeling his eyes had been on me for a long time. His face was carefully composed, but there was surprise and suspicion in there again. It made me tired. What would be the point of acting out a charade now, even if I were that talented a liar? Walter would never stand up for me again. I couldn\u0027t sucker him anymore. I met Jared\u0027s gaze for one long second, then turned to hurry down the pitch-black corridor that was brighter than his expression.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-32.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
