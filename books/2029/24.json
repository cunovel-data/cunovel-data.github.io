{"id":108444,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"The shadow was huge and misshapen. It loomed over me, top-heavy, swinging closer to my face.\\n\\n I think I meant to scream, but the sound got trapped in my throat, and all that came out was a breathless squeak.\\n\\n \"Shh, it\u0027s just me,\" Jamie whispered. Something bulky and roundish rolled from his shoulders and plopped softly to the floor. When it was gone I could see his true, lithe shadow against the moonlight.\\n\\n I caught a few gasps of air, my hand clutching at my throat.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" he whispered, sitting down on the edge of the mattress. \"I guess that was pretty stupid. I was trying not to wake Doc-I didn\u0027t even think how I would scare you. You okay?\" He patted my ankle, which was the part of me closest to him.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I huffed, still breathless.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" he muttered again.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here, Jamie? Shouldn\u0027t you be asleep?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Uncle Jeb was snoring like you wouldn\u0027t believe. I couldn\u0027t stand it anymore.\"\\n\\n His answer didn\u0027t make sense to me. \"Don\u0027t you usually sleep with Jeb?\"\\n\\n Jamie yawned and bent to untie the bulky bedroll he\u0027d dropped to the floor. \"No, I usually sleep with Jared. He doesn\u0027t snore. But you know that.\"\\n\\n I did.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you sleep in Jared\u0027s room, then? Are you afraid to sleep alone?\" I wouldn\u0027t have blamed him for that. It seemed like I was constantly terrified here.\\n\\n \"Afraid,\" he grumbled, offended. \"No. This is Jared\u0027s room. And mine.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I gasped. \"Jeb put me in Jared\u0027s room?\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t believe it. Jared would kill me. No, he would kill Jeb first, and then he would kill me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my room, too. And I told Jeb you could have it.\"\\n\\n \"Jared will be furious,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"I can do what I want with my room,\" Jamie muttered rebelliously, but then he bit his lip. \"We won\u0027t tell him. He doesn\u0027t have to know.\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Good idea.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mind if I sleep in here, do you? Uncle Jeb\u0027s really loud.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t mind. But Jamie, I don\u0027t think you should.\"\\n\\n He frowned, trying to be tough instead of hurt. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s not safe. Sometimes people come looking for me at night.\"\\n\\n His eyes went wide. \"They do?\"\\n\\n \"Jared always had the gun-they went away.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know-Kyle sometimes. But there are surely others who are still here.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"All the more reason why I should stay. Doc might need help.\"\\n\\n \"Jamie -\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a kid, Wanda. I can take care of myself.\"\\n\\n Obviously, arguing was only going to make him more stubborn. \"At least take the bed,\" I said, surrendering. \"I\u0027ll sleep on the floor. It\u0027s your room.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not right. You\u0027re the guest.\"\\n\\n I snorted quietly. \"Ha. No, the bed is yours.\"\\n\\n \"No way.\" He lay down on the mat, folding his arms tightly across his chest.\\n\\n Again, I saw that arguing was the wrong approach to take with Jamie. Well, this one I could rectify as soon as he was asleep. Jamie slept so deeply it was almost a coma. Melanie could carry him anywhere once he was out.\\n\\n \"You can use my pillow,\" he told me, patting the one next to the side where he lay. \"You don\u0027t need to scrunch up at the bottom there.\"\\n\\n I sighed but crawled to the top of the bed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" he said approvingly. \"Now, could you throw me Jared\u0027s?\"\\n\\n I hesitated, about to reach for the pillow under my head; he jumped up, leaned over me, and snatched the other pillow. I sighed again.\\n\\n We lay in silence for a while, listening to the low whistle of the doctor\u0027s breathing.\\n\\n \"Doc has a nice snore, doesn\u0027t he?\" Jamie whispered.\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t keep you up,\" I agreed.\\n\\n \"You tired?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n I waited for him to say something more, but he was quiet.\\n\\n \"Was there something you wanted?\" I asked.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer right away, but I could feel him struggling, so I waited.\\n\\n \"If I asked you something, would you tell me the truth?\"\\n\\n It was my turn to hesitate. \"I don\u0027t know everything,\" I hedged.\\n\\n \"You would know this. When we were walking... me and Jeb... he was telling me some things. Things he thought, but I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n Melanie was suddenly very there in my head.\\n\\n Jamie\u0027s whisper was hard to hear, quieter than my breathing. \"Uncle Jeb thinks that Melanie might still be alive. Inside there with you, I mean.\"\\n\\n My Jamie. Melanie sighed.\\n\\n I said nothing to either of them.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know that could happen. Does that happen?\" His voice broke, and I could hear that he was fighting tears. He was not a boy to cry, and here I\u0027d grieved him this deeply twice in one day. A pain pierced through the general region of my chest.\\n\\n \"Does it, Wanda?\"\\n\\n Tell him. Please tell him that I love him.\\n\\n \"Why won\u0027t you answer me?\" Jamie was really crying now but trying to muffle the sound.\\n\\n I crawled off the bed, squeezing into the hard space between the mattress and the mat, and threw my arm over his shaking chest. I leaned my head against his hair and felt his tears, warm on my neck.\\n\\n \"Is Melanie still alive, Wanda? Please?\"\\n\\n He was probably a tool. The old man could have sent him just for this; Jeb was smart enough to see how easily Jamie broke through my defenses. It was possible that Jeb was seeking confirmation for his theory, and he wasn\u0027t against using the boy to get it. What would Jeb do when he was certain of the dangerous truth? How would he use the information? I didn\u0027t think he meant me harm, but could I trust my own judgment? Humans were deceitful, treacherous creatures. I couldn\u0027t anticipate their darker agendas when such things were unthinkable to my species.\\n\\n Jamie\u0027s body shook beside me.\\n\\n He\u0027s suffering, Melanie cried. She battered ineffectually at my control.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t blame this on Melanie if it turned out to be a huge mistake. I knew who was speaking now.\\n\\n \"She promised she would come back, didn\u0027t she?\" I murmured. \"Would Melanie break a promise to you?\"\\n\\n Jamie slid his arms around my waist and clung to me for a long time. After a few minutes, he whispered, \"Love you, Mel.\"\\n\\n \"She loves you, too. She\u0027s so happy that you\u0027re here and safe.\"\\n\\n He was silent long enough for the tears on my skin to dry, leaving a fine, salty dust behind.\\n\\n \"Is everybody like that?\" Jamie whispered long after I thought he\u0027d fallen asleep. \"Does everybody stay?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I told him sadly. \"No. Melanie is special.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s strong and brave.\"\\n\\n \"Very.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think...\" He paused to sniff. \"Do you think that maybe Dad is still there, too?\"\\n\\n I swallowed, trying to move the lump farther down my throat. It didn\u0027t work. \"No, Jamie. No, I don\u0027t think so. Not like Melanie is.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because he brought the Seekers looking for you. Well, the soul inside him did. Your father wouldn\u0027t have let that happen if he were still there. Your sister never let me see where the cabin was-she didn\u0027t even let me know that you existed for the longest time. She didn\u0027t bring me here until she was sure that I wouldn\u0027t hurt you.\"\\n\\n It was too much information. Only as I finished speaking did I realize that the doctor wasn\u0027t snoring anymore. I could hear no noise from his breathing. Stupid. I cursed myself internally.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" Jamie said.\\n\\n I whispered into his ear, so close that there was no way the doctor could possibly overhear. \"Yes, she\u0027s very strong.\"\\n\\n Jamie strained to hear me, frowning, and then glanced at the opening to the dark hall. He must have realized the same thing I had, because he turned his face to my ear and whispered back softer than before. \"Why would you do that? Not hurt us? Isn\u0027t that what you want?\"\\n\\n \"No. I don\u0027t want to hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Your sister and I have... spent a lot of time together. She shared you with me. And... I started to... to love you, too.\"\\n\\n \"And Jared, too?\"\\n\\n I gritted my teeth for a second, chagrined that he had made the connection so easily. \"Of course I don\u0027t want anything to hurt Jared, either.\"\\n\\n \"He hates you,\" Jamie told me, plainly grieved by the fact.\\n\\n \"Yes. Everyone does.\" I sighed. \"I can\u0027t blame them.\"\\n\\n \"Jeb doesn\u0027t. And I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You might, after you think about it more.\"\\n\\n \"But you weren\u0027t even here when they took over. You didn\u0027t pick my dad or my mom or Melanie. You were in outer space then, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but I am what I am, Jamie. I did what souls do. I\u0027ve had many hosts before Melanie, and nothing\u0027s stopped me from... taking lives. Again and again. It\u0027s how I live.\"\\n\\n \"Does Melanie hate you?\"\\n\\n I thought for a minute. \"Not as much as she used to.\"\\n\\n No. I don\u0027t hate you at all. Not anymore.\\n\\n \"She says she doesn\u0027t hate me at all anymore,\" I murmured almost silently.\\n\\n \"How... how is she?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s happy to be here. She\u0027s so happy to see you. She doesn\u0027t even care that they\u0027re going to kill us.\"\\n\\n Jamie stiffened under my arm. \"They can\u0027t! Not if Mel\u0027s still alive!\"\\n\\n You\u0027ve upset him, Melanie complained. You didn\u0027t have to say that.\\n\\n It won\u0027t be any easier for him if he\u0027s unprepared.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t believe that, Jamie,\" I whispered. \"They\u0027ll think I\u0027m lying to trick you. They\u0027ll just want to kill me more if you tell them that. Only Seekers lie.\"\\n\\n The word made him shudder.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re not lying. I know it,\" he said after a moment.\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t let them kill her.\"\\n\\n His voice, though quiet as a breath, was fierce with determination. I was paralyzed at the thought of him becoming more involved with this situation, with me. I thought of the barbarians he lived with. Would his age protect him from them if he tried to protect me? I doubted it. My thoughts scrambled, searching for some way to dissuade him without triggering his stubbornness.\\n\\n Jamie spoke before I could say anything; he was suddenly calm, as if the answer was plain in front of him. \"Jared will think of something. He always does.\"\\n\\n \"Jared won\u0027t believe you, either. He\u0027ll be the angriest of them all.\"\\n\\n \"Even if he doesn\u0027t believe it, he\u0027ll protect her. Just in case.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see,\" I muttered. I\u0027d find the perfect words later-the argument that would not sound like an argument.\\n\\n Jamie was quiet, thinking. Eventually, his breathing got slower, and his mouth fell open. I waited until I was sure he was deeply under, and then I crawled over him and very carefully shifted him from the floor to the bed. He was heavier than before, but I managed. He didn\u0027t wake.\\n\\n I put Jared\u0027s pillow back where it belonged, and then stretched out on the mat.\\n\\n Well, I thought, I just hurled myself out of the frying pan. But I was too tired to care what this would mean tomorrow. Within seconds, I was unconscious.\\n\\n When I woke, the crevices in the ceiling were bright with echoed sunlight, and someone was whistling.\\n\\n The whistling stopped.\\n\\n \"Finally,\" Jeb muttered when my eyes fluttered.\\n\\n I rolled onto my side so that I could look at him; as I moved, Jamie\u0027s hand slid from my arm. Sometime in the night he must have reached out to me-well, not to me, to his sister.\\n\\n Jeb was leaning against the natural rock door frame, his arms folded across his chest. \"Morning,\" he said. \"Get enough sleep?\"\\n\\n I stretched, decided that I felt acceptably rested, and then nodded.\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t give me the silent treatment again,\" he complained, scowling.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I murmured. \"I slept well, thank you.\"\\n\\n Jamie stirred at the sound of my voice.\\n\\n \"Wanda?\" he asked.\\n\\n I was ridiculously touched that it was my silly nickname that he spoke on the edge of sleep.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n Jamie blinked and pulled his tangled hair out of his eyes. \"Oh, hey, Uncle Jeb.\"\\n\\n \"My room not good enough for you, kid?\"\\n\\n \"You snore real loud,\" Jamie said, and then yawned.\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t I taught you anything?\" Jeb asked him. \"Since when do you let a guest and a lady sleep on the floor?\"\\n\\n Jamie sat up suddenly, staring around, disoriented. He frowned.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t upset him,\" I told Jeb. \"He insisted on taking the mat. I moved him when he was asleep.\"\\n\\n Jamie snorted. \"Mel always used to do that, too.\"\\n\\n I widened my eyes slightly at him, trying to convey a warning.\\n\\n Jeb chuckled. I looked up at him, and he had that same pouncing-cat expression he\u0027d had yesterday. The solved-puzzle expression. He walked over and kicked the edge of the mattress.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve already missed your morning class. Sharon\u0027s bound to be testy about that, so get a move on.\"\\n\\n \"Sharon is always testy,\" Jamie complained, but he got to his feet quickly.\\n\\n \"On your way, boy.\"\\n\\n Jamie looked at me again, then he turned and disappeared into the hall.\\n\\n \"Now,\" Jeb said as soon as we were alone. \"I think all this baby-sitting nonsense has gone on long enough. I\u0027m a busy man. Everyone is busy here-too busy to sit around playin\u0027 guard. So today you\u0027re going to have to come along with me while I get my chores done.\"\\n\\n I felt my mouth pop open.\\n\\n He stared at me, no smile.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t look so terrified,\" he grumbled. \"You\u0027ll be fine.\" He patted his gun. \"My house is no place for babies.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t argue with that. I took three quick, deep breaths, trying to steady my nerves. Blood pulsed so loudly in my ears that his voice seemed quiet in comparison when he spoke again.\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon, Wanda. Day\u0027s wasting.\"\\n\\n He turned and stomped out of the room.\\n\\n I was frozen for a moment, and then I lurched out after him. He wasn\u0027t bluffing-he was already invisible around the first corner. I raced after him, horrified by the thought that I might run into someone else in this obviously inhabited wing. I caught up to him before he reached the big intersection of the tunnels. He didn\u0027t even look at me as I slowed beside him to match his pace.\\n\\n \"\u0027Bout time that northeast field was planted. We\u0027ll have to work the soil first. Hope you don\u0027t mind getting your hands dirty. After we\u0027re done, I\u0027ll see that you get a chance to clean yourself up. You need it.\" He sniffed pointedly, then laughed.\\n\\n I felt the back of my neck get hot, but I ignored the last part. \"I don\u0027t mind getting my hands dirty,\" I murmured. As I recalled, the empty northeastern field was out of the way. Perhaps we would be able to work alone.\\n\\n Once we got to the big plaza cave, we started passing humans. They all stared, infuriated, as usual. I was beginning to recognize most of them: the middle-aged woman with the long salt-and-pepper braid I had seen with the irrigation team yesterday. The short man with the round belly, thinning sandy hair, and ruddy cheeks had been with her. The athletic-looking woman with the caramel brown skin had been the one bent to tie her shoe the first time I\u0027d come out here during the day. Another dark-skinned woman with thick lips and sleepy eyes had been in the kitchen, near the two black-haired children-perhaps she was their mother? Now we passed Maggie; she glowered at Jeb and turned her face away from me. We passed a pale, sick-looking man with white hair whom I was sure I\u0027d never seen before. Then we passed Ian.\\n\\n \"Hey, Jeb,\" he said cheerfully. \"Whatcha up to?\"\\n\\n \"Turning the soil in the east field,\" Jeb grunted.\\n\\n \"Want some help?\"\\n\\n \"Ought to make yourself useful,\" Jeb muttered.\\n\\n Ian took this as an assent and fell into step behind me. It gave me goose bumps, feeling his eyes on my back.\\n\\n We passed a young man who couldn\u0027t have been many years older than Jamie-his dark hair stood up from his olive-toned forehead like steel wool.\\n\\n \"Hey, Wes,\" Ian greeted him.\\n\\n Wes watched in silence as we passed. Ian laughed at his expression.\\n\\n We passed Doc.\\n\\n \"Hey, Doc,\" Ian said.\\n\\n \"Ian.\" Doc nodded. In his hands was a big wad of dough. His shirt was covered with dark, coarse flour. \"Morning, Jeb. Morning, Wanda.\"\\n\\n \"Morning,\" Jeb answered.\\n\\n I nodded uneasily.\\n\\n \"See you \u0027round,\" Doc said, hurrying off with his burden.\\n\\n \"Wanda, huh?\" Ian asked.\\n\\n \"My idea,\" Jeb told him. \"Suits her, I think.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting\" was all Ian said.\\n\\n We finally made it to the northeastern field, where my hopes were dashed.\\n\\n There were more people here than there had been in the passageways-five women and nine men. They all stopped what they were doing and scowled, naturally.\\n\\n \"Pay \u0027em no mind,\" Jeb murmured to me.\\n\\n Jeb proceeded to follow his own advice; he went to a jumbled pile of tools against the closest wall, shoved his gun through the strap at his waist, and grabbed a pick and two shovels.\\n\\n I felt exposed, having him so far away. Ian was just a step behind me-I could hear him breathing. The others in the room continued to glower, their tools still in their hands. I didn\u0027t miss the fact that the picks and hoes that were breaking the earth could easily be used to break a body. It seemed to me, in reading a few of their expressions, that I wasn\u0027t the only one with that idea.\\n\\n Jeb came back and handed me a shovel. I gripped the smooth, worn wooden handle, feeling its weight. After seeing the bloodlust in the humans\u0027 eyes, it was hard not to think of it as a weapon. I didn\u0027t like the idea. I doubted I could raise it as one, even to block a blow.\\n\\n Jeb gave Ian the pick. The sharp, blackened metal looked deadly in his hands. It took all my willpower not to skip out of range.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s take the back corner.\"\\n\\n At least Jeb took me to the least crowded spot in the long, sunny cave. He had Ian pulverize the hard-baked dirt ahead of us, while I flipped the clods over and he followed behind, crushing the chunks into usable soil with the edge of his shovel.\\n\\n Watching the sweat run down Ian\u0027s fair skin-he\u0027d removed his shirt after a few seconds in the dry scorch of the mirror light-and hearing Jeb\u0027s grunted breaths behind me, I could see that I had the easiest job. I wished I had something more difficult to do, something that would keep me from being distracted by the movements of the other humans. Their every motion had me cringing and flinching.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t do Ian\u0027s job-I didn\u0027t have the thick arm and back muscles needed to really chew into the hard soil. But I decided to do what I could of Jeb\u0027s, prechopping the clods into smaller bits before I moved on. It helped a little bit-kept my eyes busy and tired me out so that I had to concentrate on making myself work.\\n\\n Ian brought us water now and then. There was a woman-short and fair, I\u0027d seen her in the kitchen yesterday-who seemed to have the job of bringing water to the others, but she ignored us. Ian brought enough for three every time. I found his about-face in regard to me unsettling. Was he really no longer intent on my death? Or just looking for an opportunity? The water always tasted funny here-sulfurous and stale-but now that taste seemed suspicious. I tried to ignore the paranoia as much as possible.\\n\\n I was working hard enough to keep my eyes busy and my mind numb; I didn\u0027t notice when we hit the end of the last row. I stopped only when Ian did. He stretched, pulling the pick overhead with two hands and popping his joints. I shied away from the raised pick, but he didn\u0027t see. I realized that everyone else had stopped, too. I looked at the fresh-turned dirt, even across the entire floor, and realized that the field was complete.\\n\\n \"Good work,\" Jeb announced in a loud voice to the group. \"We\u0027ll seed and water tomorrow.\"\\n\\n The room was filled with soft chatter and clanks as the tools were piled against the wall once more. Some of the talk was casual; some was still tense because of me. Ian held his hand out for my shovel, and I handed it to him, feeling my already low mood sink right to the floor. I had no doubt that I would be included in Jeb\u0027s \"we.\" Tomorrow would be just as hard as today.\\n\\n I looked at Jeb mournfully, and he was smiling in my direction. There was a smugness to his grin that made me believe he knew what I was thinking-not only did he guess my discomfort, but he was enjoying it.\\n\\n He winked at me, my crazy friend. I realized again that this was the best to be expected from human friendship.\\n\\n \"See you tomorrow, Wanda,\" Ian called from across the room, and laughed to himself.\\n\\n Everyone stared. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-24.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
