{"id":108451,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"M el?\" he asked again, the hope he didn\u0027t want to feel coloring his tone. My breath caught in another sob, an aftershock. \"You know that was for you, Mel. You know that. Not for h-it. You know I wasn\u0027t kissing it.\" My next sob was louder, a moan. Why couldn\u0027t I shut up? I tried holding my breath. \"If you\u0027re in there, Mel...\" He paused. Melanie hated the \"if.\" A sob burst up through my lungs, and I gasped for air. \"I love you,\" Jared said. \"Even if you\u0027re not there, if you can\u0027t hear me. I love you.\" I held my breath again, biting my lip until it bled. The physical pain didn\u0027t distract me as much as I wished it would. It was silent outside the hole, and then silent inside, too, as I turned blue. I listened intently, concentrating only on what I could hear. I wouldn\u0027t think. There was no sound. I was twisted into the most impossible position. My head was the lowest point, the right side of my face pressed against the rough rock floor. My shoulders were slanted around a crumpled box edge, the right higher than the left. My hips angled the opposite way, with my left calf pressed to the ceiling. Fighting with the boxes had left bruises-I could feel them forming. I knew I would have to find some way to explain to Ian and Jamie that I had done this to myself, but how? What should I say? How could I tell them that Jared had kissed me as a test, like giving a lab rat a jolt of electricity to observe its reaction? And how long was I supposed to hold this position? I didn\u0027t want to make any noise, but it felt like my spine was going to snap in a minute. The pain got more difficult to bear every second. I wouldn\u0027t be able to bear it in silence for long. Already, a whimper was rising in my throat. Melanie had nothing to say to me. She was quietly working through her own relief and fury. Jared had spoken to her, finally recognized her existence. He had told her he loved her. But he had kissed me. She was trying to convince herself that there was no reason to be wounded by this, trying to believe all the solid reasons why this wasn\u0027t what it felt like. Trying, but not yet succeeding. I could hear all this, but it was directed internally. She wasn\u0027t speaking to me-in the juvenile, petty sense of the phrase. I was getting the cold shoulder. I felt an unfamiliar anger toward her. Not like the beginning, when I feared her and wished for her eradication from my mind. No, I felt my own sense of betrayal now. How could she be angry with me for what had happened? How did that make sense? How was it my fault that I\u0027d fallen in love because of the memories she forced on me and then been overthrown by this unruly body? I cared that she was suffering, yet my pain meant nothing to her. She enjoyed it. Vicious human. Tears, much weaker than the others, flowed down my cheeks in silence. Her hostility toward me simmered in my mind. Abruptly, the pain in my bruised, twisted back was too much. The straw on the camel. \"Ung,\" I grunted, pushing against stone and cardboard as I shoved myself backward. I didn\u0027t care about the noise anymore, I just wanted out. I swore to myself that I would never cross the threshold of this wretched pit again-death first. Literally. It was harder to worm out than it had been to dive in. I wiggled and squirmed around until I felt like I was making things worse, bending myself into the shape of a lopsided pretzel. I started to cry again, like a child, afraid that I would never get free. Melanie sighed. Hook your foot around the edge of the mouth and pull yourself out, she suggested. I ignored her, struggling to work my torso around a particularly pointy corner. It jabbed me just under the ribs. Don\u0027t be petty, she grumbled. That\u0027s rich, coming from you. I know. She hesitated, then caved. Okay, sorry. I am. Look, I\u0027m human. It\u0027s hard to be fair sometimes. We don\u0027t always feel the right thing, do the right thing. The resentment was still there, but she was trying to forgive and forget that I\u0027d just made out with her true love-that\u0027s the way she thought of it, at least. I hooked my foot around the edge and yanked. My knee hit the floor, and I used that leverage to lift my ribs off the point. It was easier then to get my other foot out and yank again. Finally, my hands found the floor and I shoved my way through, a breech birth, falling onto the dark green mat. I lay there for a moment, facedown, breathing. I was sure at this point that Jared was long gone, but I didn\u0027t make certain of that right away. I just breathed in and out until I felt prepared to lift my head. I was alone. I tried to hold on to the relief and forget the sorrow this fact engendered. It was better to be alone. Less humiliating. I curled up on the mat, pressing my face against the musty fabric. I wasn\u0027t sleepy, but I was tired. The crushing weight of Jared\u0027s rejection was so heavy it exhausted me. I closed my eyes and tried to think about things that wouldn\u0027t make my stinging eyes tear again. Anything but the appalled look on Jared\u0027s face when he\u0027d broken away from me... What was Jamie doing now? Did he know I was here, or was he looking for me? Ian would be asleep for a long time, he\u0027d looked so exhausted. Would Kyle wake soon? Would he come in search? Where was Jeb? I hadn\u0027t seen him all day. Was Doc really drinking himself unconscious? That seemed so unlike him... I woke slowly, roused by my growling stomach. I lay quietly for a few minutes, trying to orient myself. Was it day or night? How long had I slept here alone? My stomach wouldn\u0027t be ignored for long, though, and I rolled up onto my knees. I must have slept for a while to be this hungry-missed a meal or two. I considered eating something from the supply pile in the hole-after all, I\u0027d already damaged pretty much everything, maybe destroyed some. But that only made me feel guiltier about the idea of taking more. I\u0027d go scavenge some rolls from the kitchen. I was feeling a little hurt, on top of all the big hurt, that I\u0027d been down here so long without anyone coming to look for me-what a vain attitude; why should anyone care what happened to me?-so I was relieved and appeased to find Jamie sitting in the doorway to the big garden, his back turned on the human world behind him, unmistakably waiting for me. My eyes brightened, and so did his. He scrambled to his feet, relief washing over his features. \"You\u0027re okay,\" he said; I wished he were right. He began to ramble. \"I mean, I didn\u0027t think Jared was lying, but he said he thought you wanted to be alone, and Jeb said I couldn\u0027t go check on you and that I had to stay right here where he could see that I wasn\u0027t sneaking back there, but even though I didn\u0027t think you were hurt or anything, it was hard to not know for sure, you know?\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" I told him. But I held my arms out, seeking comfort. He threw his arms around my waist, and I was shocked to find that his head could rest on my shoulder while we stood. \"Your eyes are red,\" he whispered. \"Was he mean to you?\" \"No.\" After all, people weren\u0027t intentionally cruel to lab rats-they were just trying to get information. \"Whatever you said to him, I think he believes us now. About Mel, I mean. How does she feel?\" \"She\u0027s glad about that.\" He nodded, pleased. \"How about you?\" I hesitated, looking for a factual response. \"Telling the truth is easier for me than trying to hide it.\" My evasion seemed to answer the question enough to satisfy him. Behind him, the light in the garden was red and fading. The sun had already set on the desert. \"I\u0027m hungry,\" I told him, and I pulled away from our hug. \"I knew you would be. I saved you something good.\" I sighed. \"Bread\u0027s fine.\" \"Let it go, Wanda. Ian says you\u0027re too self-sacrificing for your own good.\" I made a face. \"I think he\u0027s got a point,\" Jamie muttered. \"Even if we all want you here, you don\u0027t belong until you decide you do.\" \"I can\u0027t ever belong. And nobody really wants me here, Jamie.\" \"I do.\" I didn\u0027t fight with him, but he was wrong. Not lying, because he believed what he was saying. But what he really wanted was Melanie. He didn\u0027t separate us the way he should. Trudy and Heidi were baking rolls in the kitchen and sharing a bright green, juicy apple. They took turns taking bites. \"It\u0027s good to see you, Wanda,\" Trudy said sincerely, covering her mouth while she spoke because she was still chewing her last bite. Heidi nodded in greeting, her teeth sunk in the apple. Jamie nudged me, trying to be inconspicuous about it-pointing out that people wanted me. He wasn\u0027t making allowances for common courtesy. \"Did you save her dinner?\" he asked eagerly. \"Yep,\" Trudy said. She bent down beside the oven and came back with a metal tray in her hand. \"Kept it warm. It\u0027s probably nasty and tough now, but it\u0027s better than the usual.\" On the tray was a rather large piece of red meat. My mouth started to water, even as I rejected the portion I\u0027d been allotted. \"It\u0027s too much.\" \"We have to eat all the perishables the first day,\" Jamie encouraged me. \"Everyone eats themselves sick-it\u0027s a tradition.\" \"You need the protein,\" Trudy added. \"We were on cave rations too long. I\u0027m surprised no one\u0027s in worse shape.\" I ate my protein while Jamie watched with hawk-like attention as each bite traveled from the tray to my mouth. I ate it all to please him, though it made my stomach ache to eat so much. The kitchen started to fill up again as I was finishing. A few had apples in their hands-all sharing with someone else. Curious eyes examined the sore side of my face. \"Why\u0027s everyone coming here now?\" I muttered to Jamie. It was black outside, the dinner hour long over. Jamie looked at me blankly for a second. \"To hear you teach.\" His tone added the words of course. \"Are you kidding me?\" \"I told you nothing\u0027s changed.\" I stared around the narrow room. It wasn\u0027t a full house. No Doc tonight, and none of the returned raiders, which meant no Paige, either. No Jeb, no Ian, no Walter. A few others missing: Travis, Carol, Ruth Ann. But more than I would have thought, if I\u0027d thought anyone would consider following the normal routine after such an abnormal day. \"Can we go back to the Dolphins, where we left off?\" Wes asked, interrupting my evaluation of the room. I could see that he\u0027d taken it upon himself to start the ball rolling, rather than that he was vitally interested in the kinship circles of an alien planet. Everyone looked at me expectantly. Apparently, life was not changing as much as I\u0027d thought. I took a tray of rolls from Heidi\u0027s hands and turned to shove it into the stone oven. I started talking with my back still turned. \"So... um... hmm... the, uh, third set of grandparents... They traditionally serve the community, as they see it. On Earth, they would be the breadwinners, the ones who leave the home and bring back sustenance. They are farmers, for the most part. They cultivate a plant-like growth that they milk for its sap...\" And life went on. Jamie tried to talk me out of sleeping in the supply corridor, but his attempt was halfhearted. There just wasn\u0027t another place for me. Stubborn as usual, he insisted on sharing my quarters. I imagined Jared didn\u0027t like that, but as I didn\u0027t see him that night or the next day, I couldn\u0027t verify my theory. It was awkward again, going about my usual chores, with the six raiders home-just like when Jeb had first forced me to join the community. Hostile stares, angry silences. It was harder for them than it was for me, though-I was used to it. They, on the other hand, were entirely unaccustomed to the way everyone else treated me. When I was helping with the corn harvest, for example, and Lily thanked me for a fresh basket with a smile, Andy\u0027s eyes bulged in their sockets at the exchange. Or when I was waiting for the bathing pool with Trudy and Heidi, and Heidi began playing with my hair. It was growing, always swinging in my eyes these days, and I was planning to shear it off again. Heidi was trying to find a style for me, flipping the strands this way and that. Brandt and Aaron-Aaron was the oldest man who\u0027d gone on the long raid, someone I couldn\u0027t remember having seen before at all-came out and found us there, Trudy laughing at some silly atrocity Heidi was attempting to create atop my head, and both men turned a little green and stalked silently past us. Of course, little things like that were nothing. Kyle roamed the caves now, and though he was obviously under orders to leave me in peace, his expression made it clear that this restriction was repugnant to him. I was always with others when I crossed his path, and I wondered if that was the only reason he did nothing more than glower at me and unconsciously curl his thick fingers into claws. This brought back all the panic from my first weeks here, and I might have succumbed to it-begun hiding again, avoiding the common areas-but something more important than Kyle\u0027s murderous glares came to my attention that second night. The kitchen filled up again-I\u0027m not sure how much was interest in my stories and how much was interest in the chocolate bars Jeb handed out. I declined mine, explaining to a disgruntled Jamie that I couldn\u0027t talk and chew at the same time; I suspected that he would save one for me, obstinate as ever. Ian was back in his usual hot seat by the fire, and Andy was there-eyes wary-beside Paige. None of the other raiders, including Jared, of course, was in attendance. Doc was not there, and I wondered if he was still drunk or perhaps hung-over. And again, Walter was absent. Geoffrey, Trudy\u0027s husband, questioned me for the first time tonight. I was pleased, though I tried not to show it, that he seemed to have joined the ranks of the humans who tolerated me. But I couldn\u0027t answer his questions well, which was too bad. His questions were like Doc\u0027s. \"I don\u0027t really know anything about Healing,\" I admitted. \"I never went to a Healer after... after I first got here. I haven\u0027t been sick. All I know is that we wouldn\u0027t choose a planet unless we were able to maintain the host bodies perfectly. There\u0027s nothing that can\u0027t be healed, from a simple cut, a broken bone, to a disease. Old age is the only cause of death now. Even healthy human bodies were only designed to last for so long. And there are accidents, too, I guess, though those don\u0027t happen as often with the souls. We\u0027re cautious.\" \"Armed humans aren\u0027t just an accident,\" someone muttered. I was moving hot rolls; I didn\u0027t see who spoke, and I didn\u0027t recognize the voice. \"Yes, that\u0027s true,\" I agreed evenly. \"So you don\u0027t know what they use to cure diseases, then?\" Geoffrey pressed. \"What\u0027s in their medications?\" I shook my head. \"I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t something I was interested in, back when I had access to the information. I\u0027m afraid I took it for granted. Good health is simply a given on every planet I\u0027ve lived on.\" Geoffrey\u0027s red cheeks flushed brighter than usual. He looked down, an angry set to his mouth. What had I said to offend him? Heath, sitting beside Geoffrey, patted his arm. There was a pregnant silence in the room. \"Uh-about the Vultures...\" Ian said-the words were forced, a deliberate subject change. \"I don\u0027t know if I missed this part sometime, but I don\u0027t remember you ever explaining about them being ��unkind\u0027...?\" It wasn\u0027t something I had explained, but I was pretty sure he wasn\u0027t really that interested-this was just the first question he\u0027d been able to think of. My informal class ended earlier than usual. The questions were slow, and most of them supplied by Jamie and Ian. Geoffrey\u0027s questions had left everyone else preoccupied. \"Well, we\u0027ve got an early one tomorrow, tearing down the stalks...\" Jeb mused after yet another awkward silence, making the words a dismissal. People rose to their feet and stretched, talking in low voices that weren\u0027t casual enough. \"What did I say?\" I whispered to Ian. \"Nothing. They\u0027ve got mortality on their minds.\" He sighed. My human brain made one of those leaps in understanding that they called intuition. \"Where\u0027s Walter?\" I demanded, still whispering. Ian sighed again. \"He\u0027s in the south wing. He\u0027s... not doing well.\" \"Why didn\u0027t anyone tell me?\" \"Things have been... difficult for you lately, so...\" I shook my head impatiently at that consideration. \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" Jamie was there beside me now; he took my hand. \"Some of Walter\u0027s bones snapped, they\u0027re so brittle,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"Doc\u0027s sure it\u0027s cancer-final stages, he says.\" \"Walt must have been keeping quiet about the pain for a long while now,\" Ian added somberly. I winced. \"And there\u0027s nothing to be done? Nothing at all?\" Ian shook his head, keeping his brilliant eyes on mine. \"Not for us. Even if we weren\u0027t stuck here, there would be no help for him now. We never cured that one.\" I bit my lip against the suggestion I wanted to make. Of course there was nothing to do for Walter. Any of these humans would rather die slowly and in pain than trade their mind for their body\u0027s cure. I could understand that... now. \"He\u0027s been asking for you,\" Ian continued. \"Well, he says your name sometimes; it\u0027s hard to tell what he means-Doc\u0027s keeping him drunk to help with the pain.\" \"Doc feels real bad about using so much of the alcohol himself,\" Jamie added. \"Bad timing, all around.\" \"Can I see him?\" I asked. \"Or will that make the others unhappy?\" Ian frowned and snorted. \"Wouldn\u0027t that be just like some people, to get worked up over this?\" He shook his head. \"Who cares, though, right? If it\u0027s Walt\u0027s final wish...\" \"Right,\" I agreed. The word final had my eyes burning. \"If seeing me is what Walter wants, then I guess it doesn\u0027t matter what anyone else thinks, or if they get mad.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about that-I\u0027m not going to let anybody harass you.\" Ian\u0027s white lips pressed into a thin line. I felt anxious, like I wanted to look at a clock. Time had ceased to mean much to me, but suddenly I felt the weight of a deadline. \"Is it too late to go tonight? Will we disturb him?\" \"He\u0027s not sleeping regular hours. We can go see.\" I started walking at once, dragging Jamie because he still gripped my hand. The sense of passing time, of endings and finality, propelled me forward. Ian caught up quickly, though, with his long stride. In the moonlit garden cavern, we passed others who for the most part paid us no mind. I was too often in the company of Jamie and Ian to cause any curiosity, though we weren\u0027t headed for the usual tunnels. The one exception was Kyle. He froze midstride when he saw his brother beside me. His eyes flashed down to see Jamie\u0027s hand in mine, and then his lips twisted into a snarl. Ian squared his shoulders as he absorbed his brother\u0027s reaction-his mouth curled into a mirror of Kyle\u0027s-and he deliberately reached for my other hand. Kyle made a noise like he was about to be sick and turned his back on us. When we were in the blackness of the long tunnel south, I tried to free that hand. Ian gripped it tighter. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t make him angrier,\" I muttered. \"Kyle is wrong. Being wrong is sort of a habit with him. He\u0027ll take longer than anyone else to get over it, but that doesn\u0027t mean we should make allowances for him.\" \"He frightens me,\" I admitted in a whisper. \"I don\u0027t want him to have more reasons to hate me.\" Ian and Jamie squeezed my hands at the same time. They spoke simultaneously. \"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" Jamie said. \"Jeb\u0027s made his opinion very clear,\" Ian said. \"What do you mean?\" I asked Ian. \"If Kyle can\u0027t accept Jeb\u0027s rules, then he\u0027s no longer welcome here.\" \"But that\u0027s wrong. Kyle belongs here.\" Ian grunted. \"He\u0027s staying... so he\u0027ll just have to learn to deal.\" We didn\u0027t talk again through the long walk. I was feeling guilty-it seemed to be a permanent emotional state here. Guilt and fear and heartbreak. Why had I come? Because you do belong here, oddly enough, Melanie whispered. She was very aware of the warmth of Ian\u0027s and Jamie\u0027s hands, wrapped around and twined with mine. Where else have you ever had this? Nowhere, I confessed, feeling only more depressed. But it doesn\u0027t make me belong. Not the way you do. We\u0027re a package deal, Wanda. As if I needed reminding... I was a little surprised to hear her so clearly. She\u0027d been quiet the last two days, waiting, anxious, hoping to see Jared again. Of course, I\u0027d been similarly occupied. Maybe he\u0027s with Walter. Maybe that\u0027s where he\u0027s been, Melanie thought hopefully. That\u0027s not why we\u0027re going to see Walter. No. Of course not. Her tone was repentant, but I realized that Walter did not mean as much to her as he did to me. Naturally, she was sad that he was dying, but she had accepted that outcome from the beginning. I, on the other hand, could not bring myself to accept it, even now. Walter was my friend, not hers. I was the one he\u0027d defended. One of those dim blue lights greeted us as we approached the hospital wing. (I knew now that the lanterns were solar powered, left in sunny corners during the day to charge.) We all moved more quietly, slowing at the same time without having to discuss it. I hated this room. In the darkness, with the odd shadows thrown by the weak glow, it seemed only more forbidding. There was a new smell-the room reeked of slow decay and stinging alcohol and bile. Two of the cots were occupied. Doc\u0027s feet hung over the edge of one; I recognized his light snore. On the other, looking hideously withered and misshapen, Walter watched us approach. \"Are you up for visitors, Walt?\" Ian whispered when Walter\u0027s eyes drifted in his direction. \"Ungh,\" Walter moaned. His lips drooped from his slack face, and his skin gleamed wetly in the low light. \"Is there anything you need?\" I murmured. I pulled my hands free-they fluttered helplessly in the air between me and Walter. His loosely rolling eyes searched the darkness. I took a step closer. \"Is there anything we can do for you? Anything at all?\" His eyes roamed till they found my face. Abruptly, they focused through the drunken stupor and the pain. \"Finally,\" he gasped. His breath wheezed and whistled. \"I knew you would come if I waited long enough. Oh, Gladys, I have so much to tell you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-31.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
