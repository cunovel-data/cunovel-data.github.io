{"id":108459,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"\"What do I think about what?\" \"About our... discussion out there,\" Ian clarified. What did I think about it? I didn\u0027t know. Somehow, Ian was able to look at things from my perspective, my alien perspective. He thought I had earned a right to my life. But he was... jealous? Of Jared? He knew what I was. He knew I was just a tiny creature fused into the back of Melanie\u0027s brain. A worm, as Kyle had said. Yet even Kyle thought Ian had a \"crush\" on me. On me? That wasn\u0027t possible. Or did he want to know what I thought about Jared? My feelings on the experiment? More details about my responses to physical contact? I shuddered. Or my thoughts on Melanie? Melanie\u0027s thoughts on their conversation? Whether I agreed with Jared about her rights? I didn\u0027t know what I thought. About any of it. \"I really don\u0027t know,\" I said. He nodded. \"That\u0027s understandable.\" \"Only because you are very understanding.\" He smiled at me. It was odd how his eyes could both scorch and warm. Especially with a color that was closer to ice than fire. They were quite warm at the moment. \"I like you very much, Wanda.\" \"I\u0027m only just beginning to see that. I guess I\u0027m a little slow.\" \"It\u0027s a surprise to me, too.\" We both thought that over. He pursed his lips. \"And... I suppose... that is one of the things you don\u0027t know how you feel about?\" \"No. I mean yes, I... don\u0027t know. I... I -\" \"That\u0027s okay. You haven\u0027t had long to think about it. And it must seem... strange.\" I nodded. \"Yes. More than strange. Impossible.\" \"Tell me something,\" Ian said after a moment. \"If I know the answer.\" \"It\u0027s not a hard question.\" He didn\u0027t ask it right away. Instead, he reached across the narrow space and picked up my hand. He held it in both of his for a moment, and then he trailed the fingers of his left hand slowly up my arm, from my wrist to my shoulder. Just as slowly, he pulled them back again. He looked at the skin of my arm rather than my face, watching the goose bumps that formed along the path of his fingers. \"Does that feel good or bad to you?\" he asked. Bad, Melanie insisted. But it doesn\u0027t hurt, I protested. That\u0027s not what he\u0027s asking. When he says good... Oh, it\u0027s like talking to a child! I\u0027m not even a year old, you know. Or am I now? I was sidetracked, trying to figure out the date. Melanie was not distracted. Good, to him, means the way it feels when Jared touches us. The memory she provided was not one from the caves. It was in the magic canyon, at sunset. Jared stood behind her and let his hands follow the shape of her arms, from her shoulders to her wrists. I shivered at the pleasure of the simple touch. Like that. Oh. \"Wanda?\" \"Melanie says bad,\" I whispered. \"What do you say?\" \"I say... I don\u0027t know.\" When I could meet his eyes, they were warmer than I expected. \"I can\u0027t even imagine how confusing this all must be to you.\" It was comforting that he understood. \"Yes. I\u0027m confused.\" His hand traced up and down my arm again. \"Would you like me to stop?\" I hesitated. \"Yes,\" I decided. \"That... what you\u0027re doing... makes it hard for me to think. And Melanie is... angry at me. That also makes it hard to think.\" I\u0027m not angry at you. Tell him to leave. Ian is my friend. I don\u0027t want him to leave. He leaned away, folding his arms across his chest. \"I don\u0027t suppose she\u0027d give us a minute alone?\" I laughed. \"I doubt it.\" Ian tilted his head to one side, his expression speculative. \"Melanie Stryder?\" he asked, addressing her. We both started at the name. Ian went on. \"I\u0027d like the chance to speak with Wanda privately, if you don\u0027t mind. Is there any way that could be arranged?\" Of all the nerve! You tell him I said no chance in hell! I do not like this man. My nose wrinkled up. \"What did she say?\" \"She said no.\" I tried to say the words as gently as they could be said. \"And that she doesn\u0027t... like you.\" Ian laughed. \"I can respect that. I can respect her. Well, it was worth a try.\" He sighed. \"Kind of puts a damper on things, having an audience.\" What things? Mel growled. I grimaced. I didn\u0027t like feeling her anger. It was so much more vicious than mine. Get used to it. Ian put his hand on my face. \"I\u0027ll let you think about things, okay? So you can decide how you feel.\" I tried to be objective about that hand. It was soft against my face. It felt... nice. Not like when Jared touched me. But also different from the way it felt when Jamie hugged me. Other. \"It might take a while. None of this makes any sense, you know,\" I told him. He grinned. \"I know.\" I realized, when he smiled then, that I wanted him to like me. The rest-the hand on my face, the fingers on my arm-I still wasn\u0027t sure at all about those. But I wanted him to like me, and to think kind things about me. Which is why it was hard to tell him the truth. \"You don\u0027t really feel that way about me, you know,\" I whispered. \"It\u0027s this body... She\u0027s pretty, isn\u0027t she?\" He nodded. \"She is. Melanie is a very pretty girl. Even beautiful.\" His hand moved to touch my bad cheek, to stroke the rough, scarring skin with gentle fingers. \"In spite of what I\u0027ve done to her face.\" Normally, I would have denied that automatically. Reminded him that the wounds on my face weren\u0027t his fault. But I was so confused that my head was spinning and I couldn\u0027t form a coherent sentence. Why should it bother me that he thought Melanie was beautiful? You\u0027ve got me there. My feelings were no clearer to her than they were to me. He brushed my hair back from my forehead. \"But, pretty as she is, she\u0027s a stranger to me. She\u0027s not the one I... care about.\" That made me feel better. Which was even more confusing. \"Ian, you don\u0027t... Nobody here separates us the way they should. Not you, not Jamie, not Jeb.\" The truth came out in a rush, more heated than I\u0027d meant it to be. \"You couldn\u0027t care about me. If you could hold me in your hand, me, you would be disgusted. You would throw me to the ground and grind me under your foot.\" His pale forehead creased as his black brows pulled together. \"I... not if I knew it was you.\" I laughed without humor. \"How would you know? You couldn\u0027t tell us apart.\" His mouth turned down. \"It\u0027s just the body,\" I repeated. \"That\u0027s not true at all,\" he disagreed. \"It\u0027s not the face, but the expressions on it. It\u0027s not the voice, but what you say. It\u0027s not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it. You are beautiful.\" He moved forward as he spoke, kneeling beside the bed where I lay and taking my hand again in both of his. \"I\u0027ve never known anyone like you.\" I sighed. \"Ian, what if I\u0027d come here in Magnolia\u0027s body?\" He grimaced and then laughed. \"Okay. That\u0027s a good question. I don\u0027t know.\" \"Or Wes\u0027s?\" \"But you\u0027re female-you yourself are.\" \"And I always request whatever a planet\u0027s equivalent is. It seems more... right. But I could be put into a man and I would function just fine.\" \"But you\u0027re not in a man\u0027s body.\" \"See? That\u0027s my point. Body and soul. Two different things, in my case.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t want it without you.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t want me without it.\" He touched my cheek again and left his hand there, his thumb under my jaw. \"But this body is part of you, too. It\u0027s part of who you are. And, unless you change your mind and turn us all in, it\u0027s who you will always be.\" Ah, the finality of it. Yes, I would die in this body. The final death. And I will never live in it again, Melanie whispered. It\u0027s not how either of us planned our future, is it? No. Neither of us planned to have no future. \"Another internal conversation?\" Ian guessed. \"We\u0027re thinking of our mortality.\" \"You could live forever if you left us.\" \"Yes, I could.\" I sighed. \"You know, humans have the shortest life span of any species I\u0027ve ever been, except the Spiders. You have so little time.\" \"Don\u0027t you think, then...\" Ian paused and leaned closer to me so that I couldn\u0027t seem to see anything around his face, just snow and sapphire and ink. \"That maybe you should make the most of what time you have? That you should live while you\u0027re alive?\" I didn\u0027t see it coming the way I had with Jared. Ian was not as familiar to me. Melanie realized what he was going to do before I did, just a second before his lips touched mine. No! It wasn\u0027t like kissing Jared. With Jared, there was no thought, only desire. No control. A spark to gasoline-inevitable. With Ian, I didn\u0027t even know what I felt. Everything was muddled and confused. His lips were soft and warm. He pressed them only lightly to mine, and then brushed them back and forth across my mouth. \"Good or bad?\" he whispered against my lips. Bad! Bad, bad! \"I-I can\u0027t think.\" When I moved my mouth to speak, he moved his with it. \"That sounds... good.\" His mouth pressed down with more force now. He caught my lower lip between his and pulled on it gently. Melanie wanted to hit him-so much more than she\u0027d wanted to punch Jared. She wanted to shove him away and then kick his face. The image was horrible. It conflicted jarringly with the sensation of Ian\u0027s kiss. \"Please,\" I whispered. \"Yes?\" \"Please stop. I can\u0027t think. Please.\" He sat back at once, clasping his hands in front of him. \"Okay,\" he said, his tone cautious. I pressed my hands against my face, wishing I could push out Melanie\u0027s anger. \"Well, at least nobody punched me.\" Ian grinned. \"She wanted to do more than that. Ugh. I don\u0027t like it when she\u0027s mad. It hurts my head. Anger is so... ugly.\" \"Why didn\u0027t she?\" \"Because I didn\u0027t lose control. She only breaks free when I\u0027m... overwhelmed.\" He watched as I kneaded my forehead. Calm down, I begged her. He\u0027s not touching me. Has he forgotten that I\u0027m here? Doesn\u0027t he care? This is me, it\u0027s me! I tried to explain that. What about you? Have you forgotten Jared? She threw the memories at me the way she\u0027d done in the beginning, only this time they were like blows. A thousand punches of his smile, his eyes, his lips on mine, his hands on my skin... Of course not. Have you forgotten that you don\u0027t want me to love him? \"She\u0027s talking to you.\" \"Yelling at me,\" I corrected. \"I can tell now. I can see you concentrate on the conversation. I never noticed before today.\" \"She\u0027s not always this vocal.\" \"I am sorry, Melanie,\" he said. \"I know this must be impossible for you.\" Again, she visualized smashing her foot into his sculpted nose, leaving it crooked like Kyle\u0027s. Tell him I don\u0027t want his apologies. I winced. Ian half smiled, half grimaced. \"She doesn\u0027t accept.\" I shook my head. \"So she can break free? If you\u0027re overwhelmed?\" I shrugged. \"Sometimes, if she takes me by surprise and I\u0027m too... emotional. Emotion makes it hard to concentrate. But it\u0027s been more difficult for her lately. It\u0027s like the door between us is locked. I don\u0027t know why. I tried to let her out when Kyle -\" I stopped talking abruptly, grinding my teeth together. \"When Kyle tried to kill you,\" he finished matter-of-factly. \"You wanted her free? Why?\" I just stared at him. \"To fight him?\" he guessed. I didn\u0027t answer. He sighed. \"Okay. Don\u0027t tell me. Why do you think the... door is locked?\" I frowned. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe the time passing... It worries us.\" \"But she broke through before, to punch Jared.\" \"Yes.\" I shuddered at the memory of my fist striking his jaw. \"Because you were overwhelmed and emotional?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did he do? Just kiss you?\" I nodded. Ian flinched. His eyes tightened. \"What?\" I asked. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"When Jared kisses you, you are... overwhelmed by emotion.\" I stared at him, worried by the expression on his face. Melanie enjoyed it. That\u0027s right! He sighed. \"And when I kiss you... you aren\u0027t sure if you like it. You are not... overwhelmed.\" \"Oh.\" Ian was jealous. How very strange this world was. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Don\u0027t be. I told you I\u0027d give you time, and I don\u0027t mind waiting for you to think things through. I don\u0027t mind that at all.\" \"What do you mind?\" Because he minded something very much. He took a deep breath and blew it out slowly. \"I saw how you loved Jamie. That was always really obvious. I guess I should have seen that you loved Jared, too. Maybe I didn\u0027t want to. It makes sense. You came here for the two of them. You love them both, the same way Melanie did. Jamie like a brother. And Jared...\" He was looking away, staring at the wall over me. I had to look away, too. I stared at the sunlight where it touched the red door. \"How much of that is Melanie?\" he wanted to know. \"I don\u0027t know. Does it matter?\" I could barely hear his answer. \"Yes. It does to me.\" Without looking at me or seeming to notice what he was doing, Ian took my hand again. It was very quiet for a minute. Even Melanie was still. That was nice. Then, as though a switch had been flipped, Ian was his normal self again. He laughed. \"Time is on my side,\" he said, grinning. \"We\u0027ve got the rest of our lives in here. One day you\u0027ll wonder what you ever saw in Jared.\" In your dreams. I laughed with him, happy he was joking again. \"Wanda? Wanda, can I come in?\" Jamie\u0027s voice started from down the hall and, accompanied by the sound of his jogging steps, ended right outside the door. \"Of course, Jamie.\" I already had my hand held out to him before he shrugged the door aside. I hadn\u0027t seen him nearly enough lately. Unconscious or crippled, I hadn\u0027t been free to seek him out. \"Hey, Wanda! Hey, Ian!\" Jamie was all grins, his messy hair bouncing when he moved. He headed for my reaching hand, but Ian was in his way. So he settled for sitting on the edge of my mattress and resting his hand on my foot. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Better.\" \"Hungry yet? There\u0027s beef jerky and corn on the cob! I could get you some.\" \"I\u0027m okay for now. How are you? I haven\u0027t seen you much lately.\" Jamie made a face. \"Sharon gave me detention.\" I smiled. \"What did you do?\" \"Nothing. I was totally framed.\" His innocent expression was a bit overdone, and he quickly changed the subject. \"Guess what? Jared was saying at lunch that he didn\u0027t think it was fair for you to have to move out of the room you were used to. He said we weren\u0027t being good hosts. He said you should move back in with me! Isn\u0027t that great? I asked him if I could tell you right away, and he said that was a good idea. He said you would be in here.\" \"I\u0027ll bet he did,\" Ian murmured. \"So what do you think, Wanda? We get to be roomies again!\" \"But Jamie, where will Jared stay?\" \"Wait-let me guess,\" Ian interrupted. \"I bet he said the room was big enough for three. Am I right?\" \"Yeah. How did you know?\" \"Lucky guess.\" \"So that\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it, Wanda? It will be just like before we came here!\" It felt sort of like a razor sliding between my ribs when he said that-too clean and precise a pain to be compared to a blow or a break. Jamie analyzed my tortured expression with alarm. \"Oh. No, I mean but with you, too. It will be nice. The four of us, right?\" I tried to laugh through the pain; it didn\u0027t hurt any worse than not laughing. Ian squeezed my hand. \"The four of us,\" I mumbled. \"Nice.\" Jamie crawled up the mattress, worming his way around Ian, to put his arms around my neck. \"Sorry. Don\u0027t be sad.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" \"You know I love you, too.\" So sharp, so piercing, the emotions of this planet. Jamie had never said those words to me before. My whole body suddenly felt a few degrees warmer. So sharp, Melanie agreed, wincing at her own pain. \"Will you come back?\" Jamie begged against my shoulder. I couldn\u0027t answer right away. \"What does Mel want?\" he asked. \"She wants to live with you,\" I whispered. I didn\u0027t have to check to know that. \"And what do you want?\" \"Do you want me to live with you?\" \"You know I do, Wanda. Please.\" I hesitated. \"Please?\" \"If that\u0027s what you want, Jamie. Okay.\" \"Woo hoo!\" Jamie crowed in my ear. \"Cool! I\u0027m gonna go tell Jared! I\u0027ll get you some food, too, okay?\" He was already on his feet, bouncing the mattress so that I felt it in my ribs. \"Okay.\" \"You want something, Ian?\" \"Sure, kid. I want you to tell Jared he\u0027s shameless.\" \"Huh?\" \"Never mind. Go get Wanda some lunch.\" \"Sure. And I\u0027ll ask Wes for his extra bed. Kyle can come back in here, and everything will be like it should be!\" \"Perfect,\" Ian said, and though I didn\u0027t look at his face, I knew he was rolling his eyes. \"Perfect,\" I whispered, and felt the razor\u0027s edge again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-39.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
