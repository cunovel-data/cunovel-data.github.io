{"id":108461,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"I slowed when I heard the sound of voices. I was not close enough to the hospital for it to be Doc. Others were on their way back. I pressed myself against the rock wall and crept forward as quietly as I could. My breathing was ragged from running. I covered my mouth with my hand to stifle the sound.\\n\\n \"... why we keep doing this,\" someone complained.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure whose voice it was. Someone I didn\u0027t know well. Maybe Violetta? It held that same depressed tone that I recognized from before. It erased any notion that I\u0027d been imagining things.\\n\\n \"Doc didn\u0027t want to. It was Jared\u0027s idea this time.\"\\n\\n I was sure that it was Geoffrey who spoke now, though his voice was a little changed by the subdued revulsion in it. Geoffrey had been with Trudy on the raid, of course. They did everything together.\\n\\n \"I thought he was the biggest opponent to this business.\"\\n\\n That was Travis, I guessed.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s more... motivated now,\" Geoffrey answered. His voice was quiet, but I could tell he was angry about something.\\n\\n They passed just half a foot from where I cringed into the rocks. I froze, holding my breath.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s sick,\" Violetta muttered. \"Disgusting. It\u0027s never going to work.\"\\n\\n They walked slowly, their steps weighted with despair.\\n\\n No one answered her. No one spoke again in my hearing. I stayed motionless until their footsteps had faded a little, but I couldn\u0027t wait until the sound disappeared completely. Ian might be following me already.\\n\\n I crept forward as quickly as I could and then started jogging again when I decided it was safe.\\n\\n I saw the first faint hints of daylight streaming around the curving tunnel ahead, and I shifted into a quieter lope that still kept me moving swiftly. I knew that once I was around the gradual arc, I would be able to see the doorway into Doc\u0027s realm. I followed the bend, and the light grew brighter.\\n\\n I moved cautiously now, putting each foot down with silent care. It was very quiet. For a moment, I wondered if I was wrong and there was no one here at all. Then, as the uneven entrance came into view, throwing a block of white sunlight against the opposite wall, I could hear the sound of quiet sobbing.\\n\\n I tiptoed right to the edge of the gap and paused, listening.\\n\\n The sobbing continued. Another sound, a soft, rhythmic thudding, kept time with it.\\n\\n \"There, there.\" It was Jeb\u0027s voice, thick with some emotion. \"\u0027S okay. \u0027S okay, Doc. Don\u0027t take it so hard.\"\\n\\n Hushed footsteps, more than one set, were moving around the room. Fabric rustling. A brushing sound. It reminded me of the sounds of cleaning.\\n\\n There was a smell that didn\u0027t belong here. Strange... not quite metallic, but not quite anything else, either. The smell was not familiar-I was sure I had never smelled it before-and yet I had an odd feeling that it should be familiar to me.\\n\\n I was afraid to move around the corner.\\n\\n What\u0027s the worst they will do to us? Mel pointed out. Make us leave?\\n\\n You\u0027re right.\\n\\n Things had definitely changed if that was the worst I could fear from the humans now.\\n\\n I took a deep breath-noticing again that strange, wrong smell-and eased around the rocky edge into the hospital.\\n\\n No one noticed me.\\n\\n Doc was kneeling on the floor, his face buried in his hands, his shoulders heaving. Jeb leaned over him, patting his back.\\n\\n Jared and Kyle were laying a crude stretcher beside one of the cots in the middle of the room. Jared\u0027s face was hard-the mask had come back while he was away.\\n\\n The cots were not empty, as they usually were. Something, hidden under dark green blankets, filled the length of both of them. Long and irregular, with familiar curves and angles...\\n\\n Doc\u0027s homemade table was arranged at the head of these cots, in the brightest spot of sunlight. The table glittered with silver-shiny scalpels and an assortment of antiquated medical tools that I couldn\u0027t put a name to.\\n\\n Brighter than these were other silver things. Shimmering segments of silver stretched in twisted, tortured pieces across the table... tiny silver strands plucked and naked and scattered... splatters of silver liquid smeared on the table, the blankets, the walls...\\n\\n The quiet in the room was shattered by my scream. The whole room was shattered. It spun and shook to the sound, whirled around me so that I couldn\u0027t find the way out. The walls, the silver-stained walls, rose up to block my escape no matter which way I turned.\\n\\n Someone shouted my name, but I couldn\u0027t hear whose voice it was. The screaming was too loud. It hurt my head. The stone wall, oozing silver, slammed into me, and I fell to the floor. Heavy hands held me there.\\n\\n \"Doc, help!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\"\\n\\n \"Is it having a fit?\"\\n\\n \"What did she see?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing-nothing. The bodies were covered!\"\\n\\n That was a lie! The bodies were hideously uncovered, strewn in obscene contortions across the glittering table. Mutilated, dismembered, tortured bodies, ripped into grotesque shreds...\\n\\n I had clearly seen the vestigial feelers still attached to the truncated anterior section of a child. Just a child! A baby! A baby thrown haphazardly in maimed pieces across the table smeared with its own blood...\\n\\n My stomach rolled like the walls were rolling, and acid clawed its way up my throat.\\n\\n \"Wanda? Can you hear me?\"\\n\\n \"Is she conscious?\"\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s going to throw up.\"\\n\\n The last voice was right. Hard hands held my head while the acid in my stomach violently overflowed.\\n\\n \"What do we do, Doc?\"\\n\\n \"Hold on to her-don\u0027t let her hurt herself.\"\\n\\n I coughed and squirmed, trying to escape. My throat cleared.\\n\\n \"Let me go!\" I was finally able to choke out. The words were garbled. \"Get away from me! Get away; you\u0027re monsters! Torturers!\"\\n\\n I shrieked wordlessly again, twisting against the restraining arms.\\n\\n \"Calm down, Wanda! Shh! It\u0027s okay!\" That was Jared\u0027s voice. For once, it didn\u0027t matter that it was Jared.\\n\\n \"Monster!\" I screamed at him.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s hysterical,\" Doc told him. \"Hold on.\"\\n\\n A sharp, stinging blow whipped across my face.\\n\\n There was a gasp, far away from the immediate chaos.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Ian roared.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s having a seizure or something, Ian. Doc\u0027s trying to bring it around.\"\\n\\n My ears were ringing, but not from the slap. It was the smell-the smell of the silver blood dripping down the walls-the smell of the blood of souls. The room writhed around me as though it were alive. The light twisted into strange patterns, curved into the shapes of monsters from my past. A Vulture unfurled its wings... a claw beast swung its heavy pincers toward my face... Doc smiled and reached for me with silver trickling from his fingertips...\\n\\n The room spun once more, slowly, and then went black.\\n\\n Unconsciousness didn\u0027t claim me for long. It must have been only seconds later when my head cleared. I was all too lucid; I wished I could stay oblivious longer.\\n\\n I was moving, rocking back and forth, and it was too black to see. Mercifully, the horrible smell had faded. The musty, humid air of the caves was like perfume.\\n\\n The feeling of being carried, being cradled, was familiar. That first week after Kyle had injured me, I\u0027d traveled many places in Ian\u0027s arms.\\n\\n \"... thought she\u0027d have guessed what we were up to. Looks like I was wrong,\" Jared was murmuring.\\n\\n \"You think that\u0027s what happened?\" Ian\u0027s voice cut hard in the quiet tunnel. \"That she was scared because Doc was trying to take the other souls out? That she was afraid for herself?\"\\n\\n Jared didn\u0027t answer for a minute. \"You don\u0027t?\"\\n\\n Ian made a sound in the back of his throat. \"No. I don\u0027t. As disgusted as I am that you would bring back more... victims for Doc, bring them back now!-as much as that turns my stomach, that\u0027s not what upset her. How can you be so blind? Can\u0027t you imagine what that must have looked like to her in there?\"\\n\\n \"I know we had the bodies covered before -\"\\n\\n \"The wrong bodies, Jared. Oh, I\u0027m sure Wanda would be upset by a human corpse-she\u0027s so gentle; violence and death aren\u0027t a part of her normal world. But think what the things on that table must have meant to her.\"\\n\\n It took him another moment. \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. If you or I had walked in on a human vivisection, with torn body parts, with blood splattered on everything, it wouldn\u0027t have been as bad for us as it was for her. We\u0027d have seen it all before-even before the invasion, in horror movies, at least. I\u0027d bet she\u0027s never been exposed to anything like that in all her lives.\"\\n\\n I was getting sick again. His words were bringing it back. The sight. The smell.\\n\\n \"Let me go,\" I whispered. \"Put me down.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to wake you. I\u0027m sorry.\" The last words were fervent, apologizing for more than waking me.\\n\\n \"Let me go.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not well. I\u0027ll take you to your room.\"\\n\\n \"No. Put me down now.\"\\n\\n \"Wanda -\"\\n\\n \"Now!\" I shouted. I shoved against Ian\u0027s chest, kicking my legs free at the same time. The ferocity of my struggle surprised him. He lost his hold on me, and I half fell into a crouch on the floor.\\n\\n I sprang up from the crouch running.\\n\\n \"Wanda!\"\\n\\n \"Let her go.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch me! Wanda, come back!\"\\n\\n It sounded like they were wrestling behind me, but I didn\u0027t slow. Of course they were fighting. They were humans. Violence was pleasure to them.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t pause when I was back in the light. I sprinted through the big cavern without looking at any of the monsters there. I could feel their eyes on me, and I didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t care where I was going, either. Just somewhere I could be alone. I avoided the tunnels that had people near them, running down the first empty one I could find.\\n\\n It was the eastern tunnel. This was the second time I\u0027d sprinted through this corridor today. Last time in joy, this time in horror. It was hard to remember how I\u0027d felt this afternoon, knowing the raiders were home. Everything was dark and gruesome now, including their return. The very stones seemed evil.\\n\\n This way was the right choice for me, though. No one had any reason to come here, and it was empty.\\n\\n I ran to the farthest end of the tunnel, into the deep night of the empty game room. Could I really have played games with them such a short time ago? Believed the smiles on their faces, not seeing the beasts underneath...\\n\\n I moved forward until I stumbled ankle deep into the oily waters of the dark spring. I backed away, my hand outstretched, searching for a wall. When I found a rough ridge of stone-sharp-edged beneath my fingers-I turned into the depression behind the protrusion and curled myself into a tight ball on the ground there.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t what we thought. Doc wasn\u0027t hurting anyone on purpose; he was just trying to save -\\n\\n GET OUT OF MY HEAD! I shrieked.\\n\\n As I thrust her away from me-gagged her so that I wouldn\u0027t have to bear her justifications-I realized how weak she\u0027d grown in all these months of friendliness. How much I\u0027d been allowing. Encouraging.\\n\\n It was almost too easy to silence her. As easy as it should have been from the beginning.\\n\\n It was only me now. Just me, and the pain and the horror that I would never escape. I would never not have that image in my head again. I would never be free of it. It was forever a part of me.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know how to mourn here. I could not mourn in human ways for these lost souls whose names I would never know. For the broken child on the table.\\n\\n I had never had to mourn on the Origin. I didn\u0027t know how it was done there, in the truest home of my kind. So I settled for the way of the Bats. It seemed appropriate, here where it was as black as being blind. The Bats mourned with silence-not singing for weeks on end until the pain of the nothingness left behind by the lack of music was worse than the pain of losing a soul. I\u0027d known loss there. A friend, killed in a freak accident, a falling tree in the night, found too late to save him from the crushed body of his host. Spiraling... Upward... Harmony; those were the words that would have held his name in this language. Not exact, but close enough. There had been no horror in his death, only grief. An accident.\\n\\n The bubbling stream was too discordant to remind me of our songs. I could grieve beside its harmony-free clatter.\\n\\n I wrapped my arms tightly around my shoulders and mourned for the child and the other soul who had died with it. My siblings. My family. If I had found a way free of this place, if I had warned the Seekers, their remains would not be so casually mangled and mixed together in that blood-steeped room.\\n\\n I wanted to cry, to keen in misery. But that was the human way. So I locked my lips and hunched in the darkness, holding the pain inside.\\n\\n My silence, my mourning, was stolen from me.\\n\\n It took them a few hours. I heard them looking, heard their voices echo and warp in the long tubes of air. They were calling for me, expecting an answer. When they received no answer, they brought lights. Not the dim blue lanterns that might never have revealed my hiding place here, buried under all this blackness, but the sharp yellow lances of flashlights. They swept back and forth, pendulums of light. Even with the flashlights, they didn\u0027t find me until the third search of the room. Why couldn\u0027t they leave me alone?\\n\\n When the flashlight\u0027s beam finally disinterred me, there was a gasp of relief.\\n\\n \"I found her! Tell the others to get back inside! She\u0027s in here after all!\"\\n\\n I knew the voice, but I didn\u0027t put a name to it. Just another monster.\\n\\n \"Wanda? Wanda? Are you all right?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t raise my head or open my eyes. I was in mourning.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Ian?\"\\n\\n \"Should we get Jamie, do you think?\"\\n\\n \"He shouldn\u0027t be on that leg.\"\\n\\n Jamie. I shuddered at his name. My Jamie. He was a monster, too. He was just like the rest of them. My Jamie. It was a physical pain to think of him.\\n\\n \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"Over here, Jared. She\u0027s not... responding.\"\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t touch her.\"\\n\\n \"Here, give me the light,\" Jared said. \"Now, the rest of you, get out of here. Emergency over. Give her some air, okay?\"\\n\\n There was a shuffling noise that didn\u0027t travel far.\\n\\n \"Seriously, people. You\u0027re not helping. Leave. All the way out.\"\\n\\n The shuffling was slow at first, but then became more productive. I could hear many footsteps fading away in the room and then disappearing out of it.\\n\\n Jared waited until it was silent again.\\n\\n \"Okay, Wanda, it\u0027s just you and me.\"\\n\\n He waited for some kind of answer.\\n\\n \"Look, I guess that must have been pretty... bad. We never wanted you to see that. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n Sorry? Geoffrey\u0027d said it was Jared\u0027s idea. He wanted to cut me out, slice me into little pieces, fling my blood on the wall. He\u0027d slowly mangle a million of me if he could find a way to keep his favorite monster alive with him. Slash us all to slivers.\\n\\n He was quiet for a long time, still waiting for me to react.\\n\\n \"You look like you want to be alone. That\u0027s okay. I can keep them away, if that\u0027s what you want.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Something touched my shoulder. I cringed away from it, into the sharp stones.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" he muttered.\\n\\n I heard him stand, and the light-red behind my closed eyes-began to fade as he walked away.\\n\\n He met someone in the mouth of the cave.\\n\\n \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"She wants to be alone. Let her be.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get in my way again, Howe.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think she wants comfort from you? From a human?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t party to this -\"\\n\\n Jared answered in a lower voice, but I could still hear the echoes. \"Not this time. You\u0027re one of us, Ian. Her enemy. Did you hear what she said in there? She was screaming monsters. That\u0027s how she sees us now. She doesn\u0027t want your comfort.\"\\n\\n \"Give me the light.\"\\n\\n They didn\u0027t speak again. A minute passed, and I heard one set of slow footsteps moving around the edge of the room. Eventually, the light swept across me, turning my lids red again.\\n\\n I huddled myself more tightly together, expecting him to touch me.\\n\\n There was a quiet sigh, and then the sound of him sitting on the stone, not as close beside me as I would have expected.\\n\\n With a click, the light disappeared.\\n\\n I waited in the silence for a long time for him to speak, but he was just as silent as I was.\\n\\n Finally, I stopped waiting and returned to my mourning. Ian did not interrupt. I sat in the blackness of the big hole in the ground and grieved for lost souls with a human at my side. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-41.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
