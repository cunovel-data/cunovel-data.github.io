{"id":108475,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"Jeb cleared a path for me, pushing people aside with his rifle as though they were sheep and the gun a shepherd\u0027s staff. \"That\u0027s enough,\" he growled at those who complained. \"You\u0027ll get a chance to dress \u0027im down later. We all will. Let\u0027s get this sorted out first, okay? Let me through.\" From the corner of my eye, I saw Sharon and Maggie fall to the back of the crowd, melting away from the reinstatement of reason. Away from my involvement, really, more than anything else. Both with jaws locked, they continued to glare at Kyle. Jared and Ian were the last two Jeb shoved aside. I brushed both of their arms as I passed, hoping to help calm them. \"Okay, Kyle,\" Jeb said, smacking the barrel of the gun against his palm. \"Don\u0027t try to excuse yourself, \u0027cause there ain\u0027t no excuse. I\u0027m plain torn between kickin\u0027 ya out and shootin\u0027 ya now.\" The little face, pale under the deep tan of her skin, peeped around Kyle\u0027s elbow again with a swish of long, curly black hair. The girl\u0027s mouth was hanging open in horror, her dark eyes frantic. I thought I could see a faint sheen to those eyes, a hint of silver behind the black. \"But right now, let\u0027s calm everybody down.\" Jeb turned around, gun held low across his body, and suddenly it was as if he were guarding Kyle and the little face behind him. He glared at the mob. \"Kyle\u0027s got a guest, and you\u0027re scarin\u0027 the snot out of her, people. I think you can all dig up some better manners than that. Now, all of you clear out and get to work on something useful. My cantaloupes are dying. Somebody do something about that, hear?\" He waited until the muttering crowd slowly dispersed. Now that I could see their faces, I could tell that they were already getting over it, most of them, anyway. This wasn\u0027t so bad, not after what they\u0027d been fearing the last few days. Yes, Kyle was a self-absorbed idiot, their faces seemed to say, but at least he was back, no harm done. No evacuation, no danger of the Seekers. No more than usual, anyway. He\u0027d brought another worm back, but then, weren\u0027t the caves full of them these days? It just wasn\u0027t as shocking as it used to be. Many went back toward their interrupted lunch, others returned to the irrigation barrel, others to their rooms. Soon only Jared, Ian, and Jamie were left beside me. Jeb looked at these three with a cross expression; his mouth opened, but before he could order them away again, Ian took my hand, and then Jamie grabbed the other. I felt another hand on my wrist, just above Jamie\u0027s. Jared. Jeb rolled his eyes at the way they\u0027d tethered themselves to me to avoid expulsion, and then turned his back on us. \"Thanks, Jeb,\" Kyle said. \"Shut the hell up, Kyle. Just keep your fat mouth shut. I\u0027m dead serious about shooting you, you worthless maggot.\" There was a weak whimper from behind Kyle. \"Okay, Jeb. But could you save the death threats till we\u0027re alone? She\u0027s terrified enough. You remember how that kind of stuff freaks Wanda out.\" Kyle smiled at me-I felt shock cross my face in reaction-and then he turned to the girl hiding behind him with the gentlest expression I\u0027d ever seen on his face. \"See, Sunny? This is Wanda, the one I told you about. She\u0027ll help us-she won\u0027t let anyone hurt you, just like me.\" The girl-or was she a woman? She was tiny, but there was a subtle curviness to her shape that suggested more maturity than her size-stared at me, her eyes huge with fright. Kyle put his arms around her waist, and she let him pull her into his side. She clung there, as if he were an anchor, her pillar of safety. \"Kyle\u0027s right.\" Never thought I\u0027d say that. \"I won\u0027t let anyone hurt you. Your name is Sunny?\" I asked softly. The woman\u0027s eyes flashed up to Kyle\u0027s face. \"It\u0027s okay. You don\u0027t have to be afraid of Wanda. She\u0027s just like you.\" He turned to me. \"Her real name is longer-something about ice.\" \"Sunlight Passing Through the Ice,\" she whispered to me. I saw Jeb\u0027s eyes brighten with his unquenchable curiosity. \"She doesn\u0027t mind being called just Sunny, though. She said it was fine,\" Kyle assured me. Sunny nodded. Her eyes flickered from my face to Kyle\u0027s and back again. The other men were totally silent and totally motionless. The little circle of calm soothed her a bit, I could see. She must have been able to feel the change in the atmosphere. There was no hostility toward her, none at all. \"I was a Bear, too, Sunny,\" I told her, trying to make her feel just a little more comfortable. \"They called me Lives in the Stars, then. Wanderer, here.\" \"Lives in the Stars,\" she whispered, her eyes somehow, impossibly, getting wider. \"Rides the Beast.\" I suppressed a groan. \"You lived in the second crystal city, I guess.\" \"Yes. I heard the story so many times...\" \"Did you like being a Bear, Sunny?\" I asked quickly. I didn\u0027t really want to get into my history right now. \"Were you happy there?\" Her face crumpled at my questions; her eyes locked onto Kyle\u0027s face and filled with tears. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I apologized at once, looking to Kyle, too, for an explanation. He patted her arm. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. You won\u0027t be hurt. I promised.\" I could barely hear her answering whisper. \"But I like it here. I want to stay.\" Her words brought a thick lump to my throat. \"I know, Sunny. I know.\" Kyle put his hand on the back of her head and, in a gesture so tender it made my eyes smart, held her face against his chest. Jeb cleared his throat, and Sunny started and cringed. It was easy to imagine the frayed state her nerves must be in. Souls were not designed to handle violence and terror. I remembered long ago when Jared had interrogated me; he\u0027d asked if I was like other souls. I was not, nor was the other soul they\u0027d dealt with, my Seeker. Sunny, however, seemed to embody the essence of my gentle, timid species; we were powerful only in great numbers. \"Sorry, Sunny,\" Jeb said. \"Didn\u0027t mean to scare you, there. Maybe we ought to get out of here, though.\" His eyes swept around the cave, where a few people lingered by the exits, gawking at us. He stared hard at Reid and Lucina, and they ducked down the corridor toward the kitchen. \"Probably ought to git along to Doc,\" Jeb continued with a sigh, giving the frightened little woman a wistful glance. I guessed he was sad to be missing out on new stories. \"Right,\" Kyle said. He kept his arm firmly around Sunny\u0027s tiny waist and pulled her with him toward the southern tunnel. I followed right behind, towing the others who still adhered to me. Jeb paused, and we all stopped with him. He jabbed the butt of his gun into Jamie\u0027s hip. \"Ain\u0027t you got school, kid?\" \"Aw, Uncle Jeb, please? Please? I don\u0027t want to miss -\" \"Get your behind to class.\" Jamie turned his hurt eyes on me, but Jeb was absolutely right. This was nothing I wanted Jamie to see. I shook my head at him. \"Could you get Trudy on your way?\" I asked. \"Doc needs her.\" Jamie\u0027s shoulders slumped, and he pulled his hand out of mine. Jared\u0027s slid down from my wrist to take its place. \"I miss everything,\" Jamie moaned as he turned back the other way. \"Thanks, Jeb,\" I whispered when Jamie was out of hearing. \"Yep.\" The long tunnel seemed blacker than before because I could feel the fear radiating from the woman ahead of me. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Kyle murmured to her. \"There\u0027s nothing that\u0027s going to hurt you, and I\u0027m here.\" I wondered who this strange man was, the one who had come back in Kyle\u0027s place. Had they checked his eyes? I couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d carried all this gentleness around inside his big angry body. It must have been having Jodi back, being so close to what he wanted. Even knowing that this was his Jodi\u0027s body, I was surprised that he could expend so much kindness for the soul inside it. I would have thought such compassion was beyond him. \"How\u0027s the Healer?\" Jared asked me. \"She woke up, just before I came to find you,\" I said. I heard more than one sigh of relief in the darkness. \"She\u0027s disoriented, though, and very frightened,\" I warned them all. \"She can\u0027t remember her name. Doc\u0027s working with her. She\u0027s going to be even more scared when she sees all of you. Try to be quiet and move slowly, okay?\" \"Yes, yes,\" the voices whispered in the darkness. \"And, Jeb, do you think you could lose the gun? She\u0027s a little afraid of humans still.\" \"Uh-okay,\" Jeb answered. \"Afraid of humans?\" Kyle murmured. \"We\u0027re the bad guys,\" Ian reminded him, squeezing my hand. I squeezed it back, glad for the warmth of his touch, the pressure of his fingers. How much longer would I have the feeling of a hand warm around mine? When was the last time I would walk down this tunnel? Was it this time? No. Not yet, Mel whispered. I was suddenly trembling. Ian\u0027s hand tightened again, and so did Jared\u0027s. We walked in silence for a few moments. \"Kyle?\" Sunny\u0027s timid voice asked. \"Yes?\" \"I don\u0027t want to go back to the Bears.\" \"You don\u0027t have to. You can go somewhere else.\" \"But I can\u0027t stay here?\" \"No. I\u0027m sorry, Sunny.\" There was a little hitch in her breathing. I was glad it was dark. No one could see the tears that started rolling down my face. I had no free hand to wipe them away, so I let them fall onto my shirt. We finally reached the end of the tunnel. The sunlight streamed from the mouth of the hospital, reflecting off the dust motes dancing in the air. I could hear Doc murmuring inside. \"That\u0027s very good,\" he was saying. \"Keep thinking of details. You know your old address-your name can\u0027t be far behind, eh? How does this feel? Not tender?\" \"Careful,\" I whispered. Kyle paused at the edge of the arch, Sunny still clinging to his side, and motioned for me to go first. I took a deep breath and walked slowly into Doc\u0027s place. I announced my presence in a low, even voice. \"Hello.\" The Healer\u0027s host started and gasped out a little shriek. \"Just me again,\" I said reassuringly. \"It\u0027s Wanda,\" Doc reminded her. The woman was sitting up now, and Doc was sitting beside her with his hand on her arm. \"That\u0027s the soul,\" the woman whispered anxiously to Doc. \"Yes, but she\u0027s a friend.\" The woman eyed me doubtfully. \"Doc? You\u0027ve got a few more visitors. Is that okay?\" Doc looked at the woman. \"These are all friends, all right? More of the humans who live here with me. None of them would ever dream of hurting you. Can they come in?\" The woman hesitated, then nodded cautiously. \"Okay,\" she whispered. \"This is Ian,\" I said, motioning him forward. \"And Jared, and Jeb.\" One by one, they walked into the room and stood beside me. \"And this is Kyle and... uh, Sunny.\" Doc\u0027s eyes bugged wide as Kyle, Sunny attached to his side, entered the room. \"Are there any more?\" the woman whispered. Doc cleared his throat, trying to compose himself. \"Yes. There are a lot of people who live here. All... well, mostly humans,\" he added, staring at Sunny. \"Trudy is on her way,\" I told Doc. \"Maybe Trudy could...\" I glanced at Sunny and Kyle. \"... find a room for... her to rest in?\" Doc nodded, still wide-eyed. \"That might be a good idea.\" \"Who\u0027s Trudy?\" the woman whispered. \"She\u0027s very nice. She\u0027ll take care of you.\" \"Is she human, or is she like that one?\" She nodded toward me. \"She\u0027s human.\" This seemed to ease the woman\u0027s mind. \"Oh,\" Sunny gasped behind me. I turned to see her staring at the cryotanks that held the Healers. They were standing in the middle of Doc\u0027s desk, the lights on top glowing muted red. On the floor in front of the desk, the seven remaining empty tanks were piled in an untidy heap. Tears sprang to Sunny\u0027s eyes again, and she buried her face against Kyle\u0027s chest. \"I don\u0027t want to go! I want to stay with you,\" she moaned to the big man she seemed to trust so completely. \"I know, Sunny. I\u0027m sorry.\" Sunny broke down into sobs. I blinked fast, trying to keep the tears from my own eyes. I crossed the small space to where Sunny stood, and stroked her springy black hair. \"I need to talk to her for a minute, Kyle,\" I murmured. He nodded, his face troubled, and pulled the clinging girl from his side. \"No, no,\" she begged. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I promised. \"He\u0027s not going anywhere. I just want to ask you a few questions.\" Kyle turned her to face me, and her arms locked around me. I pulled her to the far corner of the room, as far from the nameless woman as I could get. I didn\u0027t want our conversation to confuse or frighten the Healer\u0027s host any more than she already was. Kyle followed, never more than a few inches away. We sat on the floor, facing the wall. \"Jeez,\" Kyle murmured. \"I didn\u0027t think it would be like this. This really sucks.\" \"How did you find her? And catch her?\" I asked. The sobbing girl didn\u0027t react as I questioned him; she just kept crying on my shoulder. \"What happened? Why is she like this?\" \"Well, I thought she might be in Las Vegas. I went there first, before I went on to Portland. See, Jodi was really close to her mother, and that\u0027s where Doris lived. I thought, seeing how you were about Jared and the kid, that maybe she would go there, even when she wasn\u0027t Jodi. And I was right. They were all there at the same old house, Doris \u0027s house: Doris, and her husband, Warren-they had other names, but I didn\u0027t hear them clearly-and Sunny. I watched them all day, until it was nighttime. Sunny was in Jodi\u0027s old room, alone. I snuck in after they\u0027d all been asleep for hours. I yanked Sunny up, threw her over my shoulder, and jumped out the window. I thought she was going to start screaming, so I was really booking it back to the jeep. Then I was afraid because she didn\u0027t start screaming. She was just so quiet! I was afraid she had... you know. Like that guy we caught once.\" I winced-I had a more recent memory. \"So I pulled her off my shoulder, and she was alive, just staring up at me, all wide-eyed. Still not screaming. I carried her back to the jeep. I\u0027d been planning to tie her up, but... she didn\u0027t look that upset. She wasn\u0027t trying to get away, at least. So I just buckled her in and started driving. \"She just stared at me for a long time, and then finally she said, ��You\u0027re Kyle,\u0027 and I said, ��Yeah, who are you?\u0027 and she told me her name. What is it again?\" \"Sunlight Passing Through the Ice,\" Sunny whispered brokenly. \"I like Sunny, though. It\u0027s nice.\" \"Anyway,\" Kyle went on after clearing his throat. \"She didn\u0027t mind talking to me at all. She wasn\u0027t afraid like I\u0027d thought she\u0027d be. So we talked.\" He was quiet for a moment. \"She was happy to see me.\" \"I used to dream about him all the time,\" Sunny whispered to me. \"Every night. I kept hoping the Seekers would find him; I missed him so much... When I saw him, I thought it was the old dream again.\" I swallowed loudly. Kyle reached across me to lay his hand on her cheek. \"She\u0027s a good kid, Wanda. Can\u0027t we send her someplace really nice?\" \"That\u0027s what I wanted to ask her about. Where have you lived, Sunny?\" I was vaguely aware of the subdued voices of the others, greeting Trudy\u0027s arrival. We had our backs to them. I wanted to see what was going on, but I was also glad not to have the distraction. I tried to concentrate on the crying soul. \"Just here and with the Bears. I was there five life terms. But I like it better here. I haven\u0027t had even a quarter of a life term here!\" \"I know. Believe me, I understand. Is there anywhere else, though, that you\u0027ve ever wanted to go? The Flowers, maybe? It\u0027s nice there; I\u0027ve been.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be a plant,\" she mumbled into my shoulder. \"The Spiders...\" I began, but then let my voice trail off. The Spiders were not the right place for Sunny. \"I\u0027m tired of cold. And I like colors.\" \"I know.\" I sighed. \"I haven\u0027t been a Dolphin, but I hear it\u0027s nice there. Color, mobility, family...\" \"They\u0027re all so far away. By the time I got anywhere, Kyle would be... He\u0027d be...\" She hiccuped and then started crying again. \"Don\u0027t you have any other choices?\" Kyle asked anxiously. \"Aren\u0027t there a lot more places out there?\" I could hear Trudy talking to the Healer\u0027s host, but I tuned out the words. Let the humans take care of their own for the moment. \"Not that the off-world ships are going to,\" I told him, shaking my head. \"There are lots of worlds, but only a few, mostly the newer ones, are still open for settling. And I\u0027m sorry, Sunny, but I have to send you far away. The Seekers want to find my friends here, and they\u0027d bring you back if they could, so you could show them the way.\" \"I don\u0027t even know the way,\" she sobbed. My shoulder was drenched with her tears. \"He covered my eyes.\" Kyle looked at me as if I could produce some kind of miracle to make this all work out perfectly. Like the medicine I\u0027d provided, some kind of magic. But I knew that I was out of magic, out of happy endings-for the soul half of the equation, at least. I stared back hopelessly at Kyle. \"It\u0027s just the Bears, the Flowers, and the Dolphins,\" I told him. \"I won\u0027t send her to the Fire Planet.\" The small woman shuddered at the name. \"Don\u0027t worry, Sunny. You\u0027ll like the Dolphins. They\u0027ll be nice. Of course they\u0027ll be nice.\" She sobbed harder. I sighed and moved on. \"Sunny, I need to ask you about Jodi.\" Kyle stiffened beside me. \"What about her?\" Sunny mumbled. \"Is she... is she in there with you? Can you hear her?\" Sunny sniffed and looked up at me. \"I don\u0027t understand what you mean.\" \"Does she ever talk to you? Are you ever aware of her thoughts?\" \"My... body\u0027s? Her thoughts? She doesn\u0027t have any. I\u0027m here now.\" I nodded slowly. \"Is that bad?\" Kyle whispered. \"I don\u0027t know enough about it to tell. It\u0027s probably not good, though.\" Kyle\u0027s eyes tightened. \"How long have you been here, Sunny?\" She frowned, thinking. \"How long is it, Kyle? Five years? Six? You disappeared before I came home.\" \"Six,\" he said. \"And how old are you?\" I asked her. \"I\u0027m twenty-seven.\" That surprised me-she was such a little thing, so young looking. I couldn\u0027t believe she was six years older than Melanie. \"Why does that matter?\" Kyle asked. \"I\u0027m not sure. It just seems like the more time someone spent as a human before they became a soul, the better chance they might have at... making a recovery. The greater the percentage of their life they spent human, the more memories they have, the more connections, the more years being called by the right name... I don\u0027t know.\" \"Is twenty-one years enough?\" he asked, his voice desperate. \"I guess we\u0027ll find out.\" \"It\u0027s not fair!\" Sunny wailed. \"Why do you get to stay? Why can\u0027t I stay, if you can?\" I had to swallow hard. \"That wouldn\u0027t be fair, would it? But I don\u0027t get to stay, Sunny. I have to go, too. And soon. Maybe we\u0027ll leave together.\" Perhaps she\u0027d be happier if she thought I was going to the Dolphins with her. By the time she knew otherwise, Sunny would have a different host with different emotions and no tie to this human beside me. Maybe. Anyway, it would be too late. \"I have to go, Sunny, just like you. I have to give my body back, too.\" And then, flat and hard from right behind us, Ian\u0027s voice broke the quiet like the crack of a whip. \"What?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-56.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
