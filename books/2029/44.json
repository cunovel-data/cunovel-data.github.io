{"id":108464,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"I imagined that from the outside, I looked as still as a statue. My hands were folded in front of me, my face was without expression, my breathing was too shallow to move my chest.\n Inside, I was spinning apart, as if the pieces of my atoms were reversing polarity and blowing away from one another.\n Bringing Melanie back had not saved him. All that I could do was not enough.\n The hall outside our room was crowded. Jared, Kyle, and Ian were back from their desperate raid, empty-handed. A cooler of ice-that was all they had to show for three days of risking their lives. Trudy was making compresses and laying them across Jamie\u0027s forehead, the back of his neck, his chest.\n Even if the ice cooled the fever, raging out of control, how long until it was all melted? An hour? More? Less? How long until he was dying again?\n I would have been the one to put the ice on him, but I couldn\u0027t move. If I moved, I would fall into microscopic pieces.\n \"Nothing?\" Doc murmured. \"Did you check -\"\n \"Every spot we could think of,\" Kyle interrupted. \"It\u0027s not like painkillers, drugs-lots of people had reason to keep those hidden. The antibiotics were always kept in the open. They\u0027re gone, Doc.\"\n Jared just stared down at the red-faced child on the bed, not speaking.\n Ian stood beside me. \"Don\u0027t look like that,\" he whispered. \"He\u0027ll pull through. He\u0027s tough.\"\n I couldn\u0027t respond. Couldn\u0027t even hear the words, really.\n Doc knelt beside Trudy and pulled Jamie\u0027s chin down. With a bowl he scooped up some of the ice water from the cooler and let it trickle into Jamie\u0027s mouth. We all heard the thick, painful sound of Jamie\u0027s swallowing. But his eyes didn\u0027t open.\n I felt as though I would never be able to move again. That I would turn into part of the stone wall. I wanted to be stone.\n If they dug a hole for Jamie in the empty desert, they would have to put me in it, too.\n Not good enough, Melanie growled.\n I was despairing, but she was filled with fury.\n They tried.\n Trying solves nothing. Jamie will not die. They have to go back out.\n For what purpose? Even if they did find your old antibiotics, what are the chances they would still be any good? They only worked half the time anyway. Inferior. He doesn\u0027t need your medicine. He needs more than that. Something that really works...\n My breathing sped up, deepened as I saw it.\n He needs mine, I realized.\n Mel and I were both awestruck by the obviousness of this idea. The simplicity of it.\n My stone lips cracked apart. \"Jamie needs real medicines. The ones the souls have. We need to get him those.\"\n Doc frowned at me. \"We don\u0027t even know what those things do, how they work.\"\n \"Does it matter?\" Some of Melanie\u0027s anger was seeping into my voice. \"They do work. They can save him.\"\n Jared stared at me. I could feel Ian\u0027s eyes on me, too, and Kyle\u0027s, and all the rest in the room. But I saw only Jared.\n \"We can\u0027t get \u0027em, Wanda,\" Jeb said, his tone already one of defeat. Giving up. \"We can only get into deserted places. There\u0027s always a bunch of your kind in a hospital. Twenty-four hours a day. Too many eyes. We won\u0027t do Jamie any good if we get caught.\"\n \"Sure,\" Kyle said in a hard voice. \"The centipedes will be only too happy to heal his body when they find us here. And make him one of them. Is that what you\u0027re after?\"\n I turned to glare at the big, sneering man. My body tensed and leaned forward. Ian put his hand on my shoulder as if he were holding me back. I didn\u0027t think I would have made any aggressive move toward Kyle, but maybe I was wrong. I was so far from my normal self.\n When I spoke, my voice was dead even, no inflection. \"There has to be a way.\"\n Jared was nodding. \"Maybe someplace small. The gun would make too much noise, but if there were enough of us to overwhelm them, we could use knives.\"\n \"No.\" My arms came unfolded, my hands falling open in shock. \"No. That\u0027s not what I meant. Not killing -\"\n No one even listened to me. Jeb was arguing with Jared.\n \"There\u0027s no way, kid. Somebody\u0027d get a call off to the Seekers. Even if we were in and out, something like that would bring \u0027em down on us in force. We\u0027d be hard-pressed to make it out at all. And they\u0027d follow.\"\n \"Wait. Can\u0027t you -\"\n They still weren\u0027t listening to me.\n \"I don\u0027t want the boy to die, either, but we can\u0027t risk everyone\u0027s lives for one person,\" Kyle said. \"People die here; it happens. We can\u0027t get crazy to save one boy.\"\n I wanted to choke him, to cut off his air in order to stop his calm words. Me, not Melanie. I was the one who wanted to turn his face purple. Melanie felt the same way, but I could tell how much of the violence came directly from me.\n \"We have to save him,\" I said, louder now.\n Jeb looked at me. \"Hon, we can\u0027t just walk in there and ask.\"\n Right then, another very simple and obvious truth occurred to me.\n \"You can\u0027t. But I can.\"\n The room fell dead silent.\n I was caught up in the beauty of the plan forming in my head. The perfection of it. I spoke mostly to myself, and to Melanie. She was impressed. This would work. We could save Jamie.\n \"They aren\u0027t suspicious. Not at all. Even if I\u0027m a horrible liar, they would never suspect me of anything. They wouldn\u0027t be listening for lies. Of course not. I\u0027m one of them. They would do anything to help me. I\u0027d say I got hurt hiking or something... and then I\u0027d find a way to be alone and I\u0027d take as much as I could hide. Think of it! I could get enough to heal everyone here. To last for years. And Jamie would be fine! Why didn\u0027t I think of this before? Maybe it wouldn\u0027t have been too late even for Walter.\"\n I looked up then, with shining eyes. It was just so perfect!\n So perfect, so absolutely right, so obvious to me, that it took me forever to understand the expressions on their faces. If Kyle\u0027s had not been so explicit, it might have taken me longer.\n Hatred. Suspicion. Fear.\n Even Jeb\u0027s poker face was not enough. His eyes were tight with mistrust.\n Every face said no.\n Are they insane? Can\u0027t they see how this would help us all?\n They don\u0027t believe me. They think I\u0027ll hurt them, hurt Jamie!\n \"Please,\" I whispered. \"It\u0027s the only way to save him.\"\n \"Patient, isn\u0027t it?\" Kyle spit. \"Bided its time well, don\u0027t you think?\"\n I fought the desire to choke him again.\n \"Doc?\" I begged.\n He didn\u0027t meet my eyes. \"Even if there was any way we could let you outside, Wanda... I just couldn\u0027t trust drugs I don\u0027t understand. Jamie\u0027s a tough kid. His system will fight this off.\"\n \"We\u0027ll go out again, Wanda,\" Ian murmured. \"We\u0027ll find something. We won\u0027t come back until we do.\"\n \"That\u0027s not good enough.\" The tears were pooling in my eyes. I looked to the one person who might possibly be in as much pain as I was. \"Jared. You know. You know I would never let anything hurt Jamie. You know I can do this. Please.\"\n He met my gaze for one long moment. Then he looked around the room, at every other face. Jeb, Doc, Kyle, Ian, Trudy. Out the door at the silent audience whose expressions mirrored Kyle\u0027s: Sharon, Violetta, Lucina, Reid, Geoffrey, Heath, Heidi, Andy, Aaron, Wes, Lily, Carol. My friends mixed in with my enemies, all of them wearing Kyle\u0027s face. He stared at the next row, which I couldn\u0027t see. Then he looked down at Jamie. There was no sound of breathing in the whole room.\n \"No, Wanda,\" he said quietly. \"No.\"\n A sigh of relief from the rest.\n My knees buckled. I fell forward and yanked free of Ian\u0027s hands when he tried to pull me back up. I crawled to Jamie and pushed Trudy aside with my elbow. The silent room watched. I took the compress from his head and refilled the melted ice. I didn\u0027t meet the stares I could feel on my skin. I couldn\u0027t see anyway. The tears swam in front of my eyes.\n \"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie,\" I crooned. \"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.\"\n I couldn\u0027t seem to do anything but sob out his name and touch the packets of ice over and over, waiting for the moment they would need changing.\n I heard them leave, a few at a time. I heard their voices, mostly angry, fade away down the halls. I couldn\u0027t make sense of the words, though.\n Jamie, Jamie, Jamie...\n \"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie...\"\n Ian knelt beside me when the room was almost empty.\n \"I know you wouldn\u0027t... but Wanda, they\u0027ll kill you if you try,\" he whispered. \"After what happened... in the hospital. They\u0027re afraid you have good reason to destroy us... Anyway, he\u0027ll be all right. You have to trust that.\"\n I turned my face from him, and he went away.\n \"Sorry, kid,\" Jeb mumbled when he left.\n Jared left. I didn\u0027t hear him go, but I knew when he was gone. That seemed right to me. He didn\u0027t love Jamie the way we did. He had proved that. He should go.\n Doc stayed, watching helplessly. I didn\u0027t look at him.\n The daylight faded slowly, turned orange and then gray. The ice melted and was gone. Jamie started to burn alive under my hands.\n \"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie...\" My voice was cracked and hoarse now, but I couldn\u0027t stop. \"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie...\"\n The room turned black. I couldn\u0027t see Jamie\u0027s face. Would he leave in the night? Had I already seen his face, his living face, for the last time?\n His name was just a whisper on my lips now, low enough that I could hear Doc\u0027s quiet snoring.\n I wiped the tepid cloth across his body without ceasing. As the water dried, it cooled him a little. The burn lessened. I began to believe that he wouldn\u0027t die tonight. But I wouldn\u0027t be able to hold him here forever. He would slip away from me. Tomorrow. The next day. And then I would die, too. I would not live without Jamie.\n Jamie, Jamie, Jamie... Melanie groaned.\n Jared didn\u0027t believe us. The lament was both of ours. We thought it at the same time.\n It was still silent. I didn\u0027t hear anything. Nothing alerted me.\n Then, suddenly, Doc cried out. The sound was oddly muffled, like he was shouting into a pillow.\n My eyes couldn\u0027t make sense of the shapes in the darkness at first. Doc was jerking strangely. And he seemed too big-like he had too many arms. It was terrifying. I leaned over Jamie\u0027s inert form, to protect him from whatever was happening. I could not flee while he lay helpless. My heart pounded against my ribs.\n Then the flailing arms were still. Doc\u0027s snore started up again, louder and thicker than before. He slumped to the ground, and the shape separated. A second figure pulled itself away from his and stood in the darkness.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Jared whispered. \"We don\u0027t have time to waste.\"\n My heart nearly exploded.\n He believes.\n I jumped to my feet, forcing my stiff knees to unbend. \"What did you do to Doc?\"\n \"Chloroform. It won\u0027t last long.\"\n I turned quickly and poured the warm water over Jamie, soaking his clothes and the mattress. He didn\u0027t stir. Perhaps that would keep him cool until Doc woke up.\n \"Follow me.\"\n I was on his heels. We moved silently, almost touching, almost running but not quite. Jared hugged the walls, and I did the same.\n He stopped when we reached the light of the moon-bright garden room. It was deserted and still.\n I could see Jared clearly for the first time. He had the gun slung behind his back and a knife sheathed at his waist. He held out his hands, and there was a length of dark fabric in them. I understood at once.\n The whispered words raced out of my mouth. \"Yes, blindfold me.\"\n He nodded, and I closed my eyes while he tied the cloth over them. I would keep them closed anyway.\n The knot was quick and tight. When he was done, I spun myself in a fast circle-once, twice...\n His hands stopped me. \"That\u0027s okay,\" he said. And then he gripped me harder and lifted me off the ground. I gasped in surprise as he threw me against his shoulder. I folded there, my head and chest hanging over his back, beside the gun. His arms held my legs against his chest, and he was already moving. I bounced as he jogged, my face brushing against his shirt with each stride.\n I had no sense of which way we were going; I didn\u0027t try to guess or think or feel. I concentrated only on the bouncing of his gait, counting steps. Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three...\n I could feel him lean as the path took him down and then up. I tried not to think about it.\n Four hundred twelve, four hundred thirteen, four hundred fourteen...\n I knew when we were out. I smelled the dry, clean breeze of the desert. The air was hot, though it had to be close to midnight.\n He pulled me down and set me on my feet.\n \"The ground is flat. Do you think you can run blindfolded?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n He grabbed my elbow tightly in his hand and took off, setting a rigorous pace. It wasn\u0027t easy. He caught me time and time again before I could fall. I started to get used to it after a while, and I kept my balance better over the tiny pits and rises. We ran until we were both gasping.\n \"If... we can get... to the jeep... we\u0027ll be in... the clear.\"\n The jeep? I felt a strange wave of nostalgia. Mel hadn\u0027t seen the jeep since the first leg of that disastrous trip to Chicago, hadn\u0027t known it had survived.\n \"If we... can\u0027t?\" I asked.\n \"They catch us... they\u0027ll kill you. Ian\u0027s... right about... that part.\"\n I tried to run faster. Not to save my life, but because I was the only one who could save Jamie\u0027s. I stumbled again.\n \"Going to... take off the blindfold. You\u0027ll be... faster.\"\n \"You sure?\"\n \"Don\u0027t... look around. \u0027Kay?\"\n \"Promise.\"\n He yanked at the knots behind my head. As the fabric fell away from my eyes, I focused them only on the ground at my feet.\n It made a world of difference. The moonlight was bright, and the sand was very smooth and pale. Jared dropped his arm and broke into a faster stride. I kept up easily now. Distance running was familiar to my body. I settled into my preferred stride. Just over a six-minute mile, I\u0027d guess. I couldn\u0027t keep up that pace forever, but I\u0027d run myself into the ground trying.\n \"You hear... anything?\" he asked.\n I listened. Just two sets of running feet on the sand.\n \"No.\"\n He grunted in approval.\n I guessed this was the reason he\u0027d stolen the gun. They couldn\u0027t stop us from a distance without it.\n It took about an hour more. I was slowing then, and so was he. My mouth burned for water.\n I\u0027d never looked up from the ground, so it startled me when he put his hand over my eyes. I faltered, and he pulled us to a walk.\n \"We\u0027re okay now. Just ahead...\"\n He left his hand over my eyes and tugged me forward. I heard our footsteps echo off something. The desert wasn\u0027t as flat here.\n \"Get in.\"\n His hand disappeared.\n It was nearly as dark as it was with him covering my eyes. Another cave. Not a deep one. If I turned around, I would be able to see out of it. I didn\u0027t turn.\n The jeep faced into the darkness. It looked just the same as I remembered it, this vehicle I had never seen. I swung myself over the door into the seat.\n Jared was in his seat already. He leaned over and tied the blindfold over my eyes again. I held still to make it easier.\n The noise of the engine scared me. It seemed too dangerous. There were so many people who shouldn\u0027t find us now.\n We moved in reverse briefly, and then the wind was blasting my face. There was a funny sound behind the jeep, something that didn\u0027t fit Melanie\u0027s memories.\n \"We\u0027re going to Tucson,\" he told me. \"We never raid there-it\u0027s too close. But we don\u0027t have time for anything else. I know where a small hospital is, not too deep into town.\"\n \"Not Saint Mary\u0027s?\"\n He heard the alarm in my voice. \"No, why?\"\n \"I know someone there.\"\n He was quiet for a minute. \"Will you be recognized?\"\n \"No. No one will know my face. We don\u0027t have... wanted people. Not like you did.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n But he had me thinking now, thinking about my appearance. Before I could voice my concerns, he took my hand and folded it around something very small.\n \"Keep that close to you.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"If they guess that you\u0027re... with us, if they\u0027re going to... put someone else in Mel\u0027s body, you put that in your mouth and bite down on it hard.\"\n \"Poison?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n I thought about that for a moment. And then I laughed; I couldn\u0027t help it. My nerves were frayed with worry.\n \"It\u0027s not a joke, Wanda,\" he said angrily. \"If you can\u0027t do it, then I have to take you back.\"\n \"No, no, I can.\" I tried to get a hold of myself. \"I know I can. That\u0027s why I\u0027m laughing.\"\n His voice was harsh. \"I don\u0027t get the joke.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you see? For millions of my own kind, I\u0027ve never been able to do that. Not for my own... children. I was always too afraid to die that final time. But I can do it for one alien child.\" I laughed again. \"It doesn\u0027t make any sense. Don\u0027t worry, though. I can die to protect Jamie.\"\n \"I\u0027m trusting you to do just that.\"\n It was silent for a moment, and then I remembered what I looked like.\n \"Jared, I don\u0027t look right. For walking into a hospital.\"\n \"We\u0027ve got better clothes stashed with the... less-conspicuous vehicles. That\u0027s where we\u0027re headed now. About five more minutes.\"\n That wasn\u0027t what I meant, but he was right. These clothes would never do. I waited to talk to him about the rest. I needed to look at myself first.\n The jeep stopped, and he pulled off the blindfold.\n \"You don\u0027t have to keep your eyes down,\" he told me when my head ducked automatically. \"There\u0027s nothing here to give us away. Just in case this place was ever discovered.\"\n It wasn\u0027t a cave. It was a rock slide. A few of the bigger boulders had been carefully excavated, leaving clever dark spaces under them that no one would suspect of housing anything but dirt and smaller rocks.\n The jeep was already lodged in a tight space. I was so close to the rock, I had to climb over the back of the jeep to get out. There was something odd attached to the bumper-chains and two very dirty tarps, all ragged and torn.\n \"Here,\" Jared said, and led the way to a shadowy crevice just a little shorter than he was. He brushed aside a dusty, dirt-colored tarp and rifled through a pile hiding behind it. He pulled out a T-shirt, soft and clean, with tags still attached. He ripped those off and threw the shirt to me. Then he dug until he found a pair of khaki pants. He checked the size, then flipped them to me, too.\n \"Put them on.\"\n I hesitated for a moment while he waited, wondering what my problem was. I flushed and then turned my back to him. I yanked my ragged shirt over my head and replaced it as quickly as my fumbling fingers could manage.\n I heard him clear his throat. \"Oh. I\u0027ll, uh, get the car.\" His footsteps moved away.\n I stripped off my tattered cutoff sweats and pulled the crisp new pants into place. My shoes were in bad shape, but they weren\u0027t that noticeable. Besides, comfortable shoes weren\u0027t always easy to come by. I could pretend I had an attachment to this pair.\n Another engine came to life, quieter than the jeep\u0027s. I turned to see a modest, unremarkable sedan pull out of a deep shadow under a boulder. Jared got out and chained the tattered tarps from the jeep to this car\u0027s rear bumper. Then he drove it to where I stood, and as I saw the heavy tarps wipe the tire tracks from the dirt, I comprehended their purpose.\n Jared leaned across the seat to open the passenger door. There was a backpack on the seat. It lay flat, empty. I nodded to myself. Yes, this I needed.\n \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n \"Hold on,\" I said.\n I crouched to look at myself in the side mirror.\n Not good. I flipped my chin-length hair over my cheek, but it wasn\u0027t enough. I touched my cheek and bit my lip.\n \"Jared. I can\u0027t go in with my face like this.\" I pointed to the long, jagged scar across my skin.\n \"What?\" he demanded.\n \"No soul would have a scar like this. They would have had it treated. They\u0027ll wonder where I\u0027ve been. They\u0027ll ask questions.\"\n His eyes widened and then narrowed. \"Maybe you should have thought of this before I snuck you out. If we go back now, they\u0027ll think it was a ploy for you to learn the way out.\"\n \"We\u0027re not going back without medicine for Jamie.\" My voice was harder than his.\n His got harder to match it. \"What do you propose we do, then, Wanda?\"\n \"I\u0027ll need a rock.\" I sighed. \"You\u0027re going to have to hit me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-44.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
