{"id":108430,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"You\u0027re afraid to fly?\" The Seeker\u0027s voice was full of disbelief edging toward mockery. \"You\u0027ve traveled through deep space eight times and you\u0027re afraid to take a shuttle to Tucson, Arizona?\" \"First of all, I\u0027m not afraid. Second, when I traveled through deep space I wasn\u0027t exactly aware of where I was, what with being stored in a hibernation chamber. And third, this host gets motion sickness on shuttles.\" The Seeker rolled her eyes in disgust. \"So take medication! What would you have done if Healer Fords hadn\u0027t relocated to Saint Mary\u0027s? Would you be driving to Chicago?\" \"No. But since the option of driving is now reasonable, I will take it. It will be nice to see a bit more of this world. The desert can be stunning -\" \"The desert is dead boring.\" \"-and I\u0027m not in any hurry. I have many things to think through, and I will appreciate some time alone.\" I looked pointedly at her as I emphasized the last word. \"I don\u0027t understand the point of visiting your old Healer anyway. There are many competent Healers here.\" \"I\u0027m comfortable with Healer Fords. He has experience with this, and I don\u0027t trust that I have all the information I need.\" I gave her another significant look. \"You don\u0027t have time to not hurry, Wanderer. I recognize the signs.\" \"Forgive me if I don\u0027t consider your information impartial. I know enough of human behavior to recognize the signs of manipulation.\" She glowered at me. I was packing my rental car with the few things I planned to take with me. I had enough clothes to go a week between washing, and the basic hygiene necessities. Though I wasn\u0027t bringing much, I was leaving even less behind. I\u0027d accumulated very little in the way of personal belongings. After all these months in my small apartment, the walls were still bare, the shelves empty. Perhaps I\u0027d never meant to settle here. The Seeker was planted on the sidewalk next to my open trunk, assailing me with snide questions and comments whenever I was in hearing distance. At least I was secure in the belief that she was far too impatient to follow me on the road. She would take a shuttle to Tucson, just as she was hoping to shame me into doing. It was a huge relief. I imagined her joining me every time I stopped to eat, hovering outside gas station bathrooms, her inexhaustible inquisitions waiting for me whenever my vehicle paused at a light. I shuddered at the thought. If a new body meant freeing myself of the Seeker... well, that was quite an inducement. I had another choice, too. I could abandon this entire world as a failure and move on to a tenth planet. I could work to forget this whole experience. Earth could be just a short blip in my otherwise spotless record. But where would I go? A planet I\u0027d already experienced? The Singing World had been one of my favorites, but to give up sight for blindness? The Planet of the Flowers was lovely... Yet chlorophyll-based life-forms had so little range of emotion. It would feel unbearably slow after the tempo of this human place. A new planet? There was a recent acquisition-here on Earth, they were calling the new hosts Dolphins for lack of a better comparison, though they resembled dragonflies more than marine mammals. A highly developed species, and certainly mobile, but after my long stay with the See Weeds, the thought of another water planet was repugnant to me. No, there was still so much to this planet that I hadn\u0027t experienced. Nowhere else in the known universe called to me as strongly as this shady little green yard on this quiet street. Or held the lure of the empty desert sky, which I\u0027d seen only in Melanie\u0027s memories. Melanie did not share her opinion on my options. She had been very quiet since my decision to find Fords Deep Waters, my first Healer. I wasn\u0027t sure what the detachment meant. Was she trying to seem less dangerous, less of a burden? Was she preparing herself for the invasion of the Seeker? For death? Or was she preparing to fight me? To try to take over? Whatever her plan, she kept herself distant. She was just a faint, watchful presence in the back of my head. I made my last trip inside, searching for anything forgotten. The apartment looked empty. There were only the basic furnishings that had been left by the last tenant. The same plates were still in the cupboards, the pillows on the bed, the lamps on the tables; if I didn\u0027t come back, there would be little for the next tenant to clear out. The phone rang as I was stepping out the door, and I turned back to get it, but I was too late. I\u0027d already set the message system to answer on the first ring. I knew what the caller would hear: my vague explanation that I would be out the rest of the semester, and that my classes would be canceled until a replacement could be found. No reason given. I looked at the clock on top of the television. It was barely past eight in the morning. I was sure it must be Curt on the phone, having just received the only slightly more detailed e-mail I\u0027d sent him late last night. I felt guilty about not finishing out my commitment to him, almost like I was already skipping. Perhaps this step, this quitting, was the prelude to my next decision, my greater shame. The thought was uncomfortable. It made me unwilling to listen to whatever the message said, though I wasn\u0027t in any real hurry to leave. I looked around the empty apartment one more time. There was no sense of leaving anything behind me, no fondness for these rooms. I had the strange feeling that this world-not just Melanie, but the entire orb of the planet-did not want me, no matter how much I wanted it. I just couldn\u0027t seem to get my roots in. I smiled wryly at the thought of roots. This feeling was just superstitious nonsense. I\u0027d never had a host that was capable of superstition. It was an interesting sensation. Like knowing you were being watched without being able to find the watcher. It raised goose bumps on the nape of my neck. I shut the door firmly behind me but did not touch the obsolete locks. No one would disturb this place until I returned or it was given to someone new. Without looking at the Seeker, I climbed into the car. I hadn\u0027t done much driving, and neither had Melanie, so this made me a bit nervous. But I was sure I would get used to it soon enough. \"I\u0027ll be waiting for you in Tucson,\" the Seeker said, leaning in the open passenger-side window as I started the engine. \"I have no doubt of that,\" I muttered. I found the controls on the door panel. Trying to hide a smile, I hit the button to raise the glass and watched her jump back. \"Maybe...,\" she said, raising her voice to almost a shout so that I could hear her over the engine noise and through the closed window, \"maybe I\u0027ll try it your way. Maybe I\u0027ll see you on the road.\" She smiled and shrugged. She was just saying it to upset me. I tried not to let her see that she had. I focused my eyes on the road ahead and pulled carefully away from the curb. It was easy enough to find the freeway and then follow the signs out of San Diego. Soon there were no signs to follow, no wrong turns to take. In eight hours I would be in Tucson. It wasn\u0027t long enough. Perhaps I would stay a night in some small town along the way. If I could be sure that the Seeker would be ahead, waiting impatiently, rather than following behind, a stop would be a nice delay. I found myself looking in the rearview mirror often, searching for a sign of pursuit. I was driving slower than anyone else, unwilling to reach my destination, and the other cars passed me without pause. There were no faces I recognized as they moved ahead. I shouldn\u0027t have let the Seeker\u0027s taunt bother me; she clearly didn\u0027t have the temperament to go anywhere slowly. Still... I continued to watch for her. I\u0027d been west to the ocean, north and south up and down the pretty California coastline, but I\u0027d never been east for any distance at all. Civilization fell behind me quickly, and I was soon surrounded by the blank hills and rocks that were the precursors to the empty desert wastelands. It was very relaxing to be away from civilization, and this bothered me. I should not have found the loneliness so welcoming. Souls were sociable. We lived and worked and grew together in harmony. We were all the same: peaceful, friendly, honest. Why should I feel better away from my kind? Was it Melanie who made me this way? I searched for her but found her remote, dreaming in the back of my head. This was the best it had been since she\u0027d started talking again. The miles passed quickly. The dark, rough rocks and the dusty plains covered in scrub flew by with monotonous uniformity. I realized I was driving faster than I\u0027d meant to. There wasn\u0027t anything to keep my mind occupied here, so I found it hard to linger. Absently, I wondered why the desert was so much more colorful in Melanie\u0027s memories, so much more compelling. I let my mind coast with hers, trying to see what it was that was special about this vacant place. But she wasn\u0027t seeing the sparse, dead land surrounding us. She was dreaming of another desert, canyoned and red, a magical place. She didn\u0027t try to keep me out. In fact, she seemed almost unaware of my presence. I questioned again what her detachment meant. I sensed no thought of attack. It felt more like a preparation for the end. She was living in a happier place in her memory, as if she were saying goodbye. It was a place she had never allowed me to see before. There was a cabin, an ingenious dwelling tucked into a nook in the red sandstone, perilously close to the flash flood line. An unlikely place, far from any trail or path, built in what seemed a senseless location. A rough place, without any of the conveniences of modern technology. She remembered laughing at the sink one had to pump to pull water up from the ground. \"It beats pipes,\" Jared says, the crease between his eyes deepening as his brows pull together. He seems worried by my laugh. Is he afraid I don\u0027t like it? \"Nothing to trace, no evidence that we\u0027re here.\" \"I love it,\" I say quickly. \"It\u0027s like an old movie. It\u0027s perfect.\" The smile that never truly leaves his face-he smiles even in his sleep-grows wide. \"They don\u0027t tell you the worst parts in the movies. C\u0027mon, I\u0027ll show you where the latrine is.\" I hear Jamie\u0027s laughter echo through the narrow canyon as he runs ahead of us. His black hair bounces with his body. He bounces all the time now, this thin boy with the sun-darkened skin. I hadn\u0027t realized how much weight those narrow shoulders were carrying. With Jared, he is positively buoyant. The anxious expression has faded, replaced by grins. We are both more resilient than I gave us credit for. \"Who built this place?\" \"My father and older brothers. I helped, or rather hindered, a little. My dad loved to get away from everything. And he didn\u0027t care much about convention. He never bothered to find out who the land actually belonged to or file permits or any of that pesky stuff.\" Jared laughs, throwing his head back. The sun dances off the blond bits in his hair. \"Officially, this place doesn\u0027t exist. Convenient, isn\u0027t it?\" Without seeming to think about it, he reaches out and takes my hand. My skin burns where it meets his. It feels better than good, but it sets off a strange aching in my chest. He is forever touching me this way, always seeming to need to reassure himself that I am here. Does he realize what it does to me, the simple pressure of his warm palm next to mine? Does his pulse jump in his veins, too? Or is he just happy to not be alone anymore? He swings our arms as we walk beneath a little stand of cottonwood trees, their green so vivid against the red that it plays tricks on my eyes, confusing my focus. He is happy here, happier than in other places. I feel happy, too. The feeling is still unfamiliar. He hasn\u0027t kissed me since that first night, when I screamed, finding the scar on his neck. Does he not want to kiss me again? Should I kiss him? What if he doesn\u0027t like that? He looks down at me and smiles, the lines around his eyes crinkling into little webs. I wonder if he is as handsome as I think he is, or if it\u0027s just that he\u0027s the only person left in the whole world besides Jamie and me. No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. He really is beautiful. \"What are you thinking, Mel?\" he asks. \"You seem to be concentrating on something very important.\" He laughs. I shrug, and my stomach flutters. \"It\u0027s beautiful here.\" He looks around us. \"Yes. But then, isn\u0027t home always beautiful?\" \"Home.\" I repeat the word quietly. \"Home.\" \"Your home, too, if you want it.\" \"I want it.\" It seems like every mile I\u0027ve walked in the past three years has been toward this place. I never want to leave, though I know we\u0027ll have to. Food doesn\u0027t grow on trees. Not in the desert, at least. He squeezes my hand, and my heart punches against my ribs. It\u0027s just like pain, this pleasure. There was a blurring sensation as Melanie skipped ahead, her thoughts dancing through the hot day until hours after the sun had fallen behind the red canyon walls. I went along, almost hypnotized by the endless road stretching ahead of me, the skeletal bushes flying by with mind-numbing sameness. I peek into the one narrow little bedroom. The full-size mattress is only inches away from the rough stone walls on either side. It gives me a deep, rich sense of joy to see Jamie asleep on a real bed, his head on a soft pillow. His lanky arms and legs sprawl out, leaving little room for me where I am meant to sleep. He is so much bigger in reality than the way I see him in my head. Almost ten-soon he won\u0027t be a child at all. Except that he will always be a child to me. Jamie breathes evenly, sleeping sound. There is no fear in his dream, for this moment at least. I shut the door quietly and go back to the small couch where Jared waits. \"Thank you,\" I whisper, though I know shouting the words wouldn\u0027t wake Jamie now. \"I feel bad. This couch is much too short for you. Maybe you should take the bed with Jamie.\" Jared chuckles. \"Mel, you\u0027re only a few inches shorter than I am. Sleep comfortably, for once. Next time I\u0027m out, I\u0027ll steal myself a cot or something.\" I don\u0027t like this, for lots of reasons. Will he be leaving soon? Will he take us with him when he goes? Does he see this room assignment as a permanent thing? He drops his arm around my shoulders and tucks me against his side. I scoot closer, though the heat of touching him has my heart aching again. \"Why the frown?\" he asks. \"When will you... when will we have to leave again?\" He shrugs. \"We scavenged enough on our way up that we\u0027re set for a few months. I can do a few short raids if you want to stay in one place for a while. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re tired of running.\" \"Yes, I am,\" I agree. I take a deep breath to make me brave. \"But if you go, I go.\" He hugs me tighter. \"I\u0027ll admit, I prefer it that way. The thought of being separated from you...\" He laughs quietly. \"Does it sound crazy to say that I\u0027d rather die? Too melodramatic?\" \"No, I know what you mean.\" He must feel the same way I do. Would he say these things if he thought of me as just another human, and not as a woman? I realize that this is the first time we\u0027ve ever been really alone since the night we met-the first time there\u0027s been a door to close between a sleeping Jamie and the two of us. So many nights we\u0027ve stayed awake, talking in whispers, telling all of our stories, the happy stories and the horror stories, always with Jamie\u0027s head cradled on my lap. It makes my breath come faster, that simple closed door. \"I don\u0027t think you need to find a cot, not yet.\" I feel his eyes on me, questioning, but I can\u0027t meet them. I\u0027m embarrassed now, too late. The words are out. \"We\u0027ll stay here until the food is gone, don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve slept on worse things than this couch.\" \"That\u0027s not what I mean,\" I say, still looking down. \"You get the bed, Mel. I\u0027m not budging on that.\" \"That\u0027s not what I mean, either.\" It\u0027s barely a whisper. \"I meant the couch is plenty big for Jamie. He won\u0027t outgrow it for a long time. I could share the bed with... you.\" There is a pause. I want to look up, to read the expression on his face, but I\u0027m too mortified. What if he is disgusted? How will I stand it? Will he make me go away? His warm, callused fingers tug my chin up. My heart throbs when our eyes meet. \"Mel, I...\" His face, for once, has no smile. I try to look away, but he holds my chin so that my gaze can\u0027t escape his. Does he not feel the fire between his body and mine? Is that all me? How can it all be me? It feels like a flat sun trapped between us-pressed like a flower between the pages of a thick book, burning the paper. Does it feel like something else to him? Something bad? After a moment, his head turns; he\u0027s the one looking away now, still keeping his grip on my chin. His voice is quiet. \"You don\u0027t owe me that, Melanie. You don\u0027t owe me anything at all.\" It\u0027s hard for me to swallow. \"I\u0027m not saying... I didn\u0027t mean that I felt obligated. And... you shouldn\u0027t, either. Forget I said anything.\" \"Not likely, Mel.\" He sighs, and I want to disappear. Give up-lose my mind to the invaders if that\u0027s what it takes to erase this huge blunder. Trade the future to blot out the last two minutes of the past. Anything. Jared takes a deep breath. He squints at the floor, his eyes and jaw tight. \"Mel, it doesn\u0027t have to be like that. Just because we\u0027re together, just because we\u0027re the last man and woman on Earth...\" He struggles for words, something I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen him do before. \"That doesn\u0027t mean you have to do anything you don\u0027t want to. I\u0027m not the kind of man who would expect... You don\u0027t have to...\" He looks so upset, still frowning away, that I find myself speaking, though I know it\u0027s a mistake before I start. \"That\u0027s not what I mean,\" I mutter. \"��Have to\u0027 is not what I\u0027m talking about, and I don\u0027t think you\u0027re ��that kind of man.\u0027 No. Of course not. It\u0027s just that -\" Just that I love him. I grit my teeth together before I can humiliate myself more. I should bite my tongue off right now before it ruins anything else. \"Just that...?\" he asks. I try to shake my head, but he\u0027s still holding my chin tight between his fingers. \"Mel?\" I yank free and shake my head fiercely. He leans closer to me, and his face is different suddenly. There\u0027s a new conflict I don\u0027t recognize in his expression, and even though I don\u0027t understand it completely, it erases the feeling of rejection that\u0027s making my eyes sting. \"Will you talk to me? Please?\" he murmurs. I can feel his breath on my cheek, and it\u0027s a few seconds before I can think at all. His eyes make me forget that I am mortified, that I wanted to never speak again. \"If I got to pick anyone, anyone at all, to be stranded on a deserted planet with, it would be you,\" I whisper. The sun between us burns hotter. \"I always want to be with you. And not just... not just to talk to. When you touch me...\" I dare to let my fingers brush lightly along the warm skin of his arm, and it feels like the flames are flowing from their tips now. His arm tightens around me. Does he feel the fire? \"I don\u0027t want you to stop.\" I want to be more exact, but I can\u0027t find the words. That\u0027s fine. It\u0027s bad enough having admitted this much. \"If you don\u0027t feel the same way, I understand. Maybe it isn\u0027t the same for you. That\u0027s okay.\" Lies. \"Oh, Mel,\" he sighs in my ear, and pulls my face around to meet his. More flames in his lips, fiercer than the others, blistering. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing, but it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. His hands are in my hair, and my heart is about to combust. I can\u0027t breathe. I don\u0027t want to breathe. But his lips move to my ear, and he holds my face when I try to find them again. \"It was a miracle-more than a miracle-when I found you, Melanie. Right now, if I was given the choice between having the world back and having you, I wouldn\u0027t be able to give you up. Not to save five billion lives.\" \"That\u0027s wrong.\" \"Very wrong but very true.\" \"Jared,\" I breathe. I try to reach for his lips again. He pulls away, looking like he has something to say. What more can there be? \"But...\" \"But?\" How can there be a but? What could possibly follow all this fire that starts with a but? \"But you\u0027re seventeen, Melanie. And I\u0027m twenty-six.\" \"What\u0027s that got to do with anything?\" He doesn\u0027t answer. His hands stroke my arms slowly, painting them with fire. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\" I lean back to search his face. \"You\u0027re going to worry about conventions when we\u0027re past the end of the world?\" He swallows loudly before he speaks. \"Most conventions exist for a reason, Mel. I would feel like a bad person, like I was taking advantage. You\u0027re very young.\" \"No one\u0027s young anymore. Anyone who\u0027s survived this long is ancient.\" There\u0027s a smile pulling up one corner of his mouth. \"Maybe you\u0027re right. But this isn\u0027t something we need to rush.\" \"What is there to wait for?\" I demand. He hesitates for a long moment, thinking. \"Well, for one thing, there are some... practical matters to consider.\" I wonder if he is just searching for a distraction, trying to stall. That\u0027s what it feels like. I raise one eyebrow. I can\u0027t believe the turn this conversation has taken. If he really does want me, this is senseless. \"See,\" he explains, hesitating. Under the deep golden tan of his skin, it looks like he might be blushing. \"When I was stocking this place, I wasn\u0027t much planning for... guests. What I mean is...\" The rest comes out in a rush. \"Birth control was pretty much the last thing on my mind.\" I feel my forehead crease. \"Oh.\" The smile is gone from his face, and for one short second there is a flash of anger I\u0027ve never seen there before. It makes him look dangerous in a way I hadn\u0027t imagined he could. \"This isn\u0027t the kind of world I\u0027d want to bring a child into.\" The words sink in, and I cringe at the thought of a tiny, innocent baby opening his eyes to this place. It\u0027s bad enough to watch Jamie\u0027s eyes, to know what this life will bring him, even in the best possible circumstances. Jared is suddenly Jared again. The skin around his eyes crinkles. \"Besides, we\u0027ve got plenty of time to... think about this.\" Stalling again, I suspect. \"Do you realize how very, very little time we\u0027ve been together so far? It\u0027s been just four weeks since we found each other.\" This floors me. \"That can\u0027t be.\" \"Twenty-nine days. I\u0027m counting.\" I think back. It\u0027s not possible that it has been only twenty-nine days since Jared changed our lives. It seems like Jamie and I have been with Jared every bit as long as we were alone. Two or three years, maybe. \"We\u0027ve got time,\" Jared says again. An abrupt panic, like a warning premonition, makes it impossible for me to speak for a long moment. He watches the change on my face with worried eyes. \"You don\u0027t know that.\" The despair that softened when he found me strikes like the lash of a whip. \"You can\u0027t know how much time we\u0027ll have. You don\u0027t know if we should be counting in months or days or hours.\" He laughs a warm laugh, touching his lips to the tense place where my eyebrows pull together. \"Don\u0027t worry, Mel. Miracles don\u0027t work that way. I\u0027ll never lose you. I\u0027ll never let you get away from me.\" She brought me back to the present-to the thin ribbon of the highway winding through the Arizona wasteland, baking under the fierce noon sun-without my choosing to return. I stared at the empty place ahead and felt the empty place inside. Her thought sighed faintly in my head: You never know how much time you\u0027ll have. The tears I was crying belonged to both of us.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-9.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
