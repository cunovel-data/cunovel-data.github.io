{"id":108474,"no":55,"title":"Page 55","content":"\"Elizabeth?\" I asked. \"Anne? Karen? What\u0027s your name? C\u0027mon. I know you know it.\" The Healer\u0027s body was still limp on the cot. It had been a long time-how long, I wasn\u0027t sure. Hours and hours. I hadn\u0027t slept yet, though the sun was far up in the sky. Doc had climbed out onto the mountain to pull the tarps away, and the sun beamed brightly through the holes in the ceiling, hot on my skin. I\u0027d moved the nameless woman so that her face would be out of the glare. I touched her face now lightly, patting the soft brown hair, woven through with white strands, away from her face. \"Julie? Brittany? Angela? Patricia? Am I getting close? Talk to me. Please?\" Everyone but Doc-snoring quietly on a cot in the darkest corner of the hospital-had gone away hours ago. Some to bury the host body we\u0027d lost. I cringed, thinking of his bewildered question, and the sudden way his face had gone slack. Why? he\u0027d asked me. I so much wished that the soul had waited for an answer, so I could have tried to explain it to him. He might even have understood. After all, what was more important, in the end, than love? To a soul, wasn\u0027t that the heart of everything? And love would have been my answer. Maybe, if he\u0027d waited, he would have seen the truth of that. If he\u0027d really understood, I was sure he would have let the human body live. The request would probably have made little sense to him, though. The body was his body, not a separate entity. His suicide was simply that to him, not a murder, too. Only one life had ended. And perhaps he was right. At least the souls had survived. The light on his tank glowed dull red beside hers; I couldn\u0027t ask for a greater evidence of commitment from my humans than this, the sparing of his life. \"Mary? Margaret? Susan? Jill?\" Though Doc slept and I was otherwise alone, I could feel the echo of the tension the others had left behind; it still hung in the air. The tension lingered because the woman had not woken up when the chloroform wore off. She had not moved. She was still breathing, her heart was still beating, but she had not responded to any of Doc\u0027s efforts to revive her. Was it too late? Was she lost? Was she already gone? Just as dead as the male body? Were all of them? Were there only a very few, like the Seeker\u0027s host, Lacey, and Melanie-the shouters, the resisters-who could be brought back? Was everyone else gone? Was Lacey an anomaly? Would Melanie come back the way she had... or was even that in question? I\u0027m not lost. I\u0027m here. But Mel\u0027s mental voice was defensive. She worried, too. Yes, you are here. And you will stay here, I promised. With a sigh, I returned to my efforts. My doomed efforts? \"I know you have a name,\" I told the woman. \"Is it Rebecca? Alexandra? Olivia? Something simpler, maybe... Jane? Jean? Joan?\" It was better than nothing, I thought glumly. At least I\u0027d given them a way to help themselves if they were ever taken. I could help the resisters, if no one else. It didn\u0027t seem like enough. \"You\u0027re not giving me much to work with,\" I murmured. I took her hand in both of mine, chafed it softly. \"It would really be nice if you would make an effort. My friends are going to be depressed enough. They could use some good news. Besides, with Kyle still gone... It will be hard to evacuate everyone without having to carry you around, too. I know you want to help. This is your family here, you know. These are your kind. They\u0027re very nice. Most of them. You\u0027ll like them.\" The gently lined face was vacant with unconsciousness. She was quite pretty in an inconspicuous way-her features very symmetrical on her oval face. Forty-five, maybe a little younger, maybe a little older. It was hard to tell with no animation in the face. \"They need you,\" I went on, pleading now. \"You can help them. You know so much that I never knew. Doc tries so hard. He deserves some help. He\u0027s a good man. You\u0027ve been a Healer for a while now; some of that care for the well-being of others must have rubbed off on you. You\u0027ll like Doc, I think. \"Is your name Sarah? Emily? Kristin?\" I stroked her soft cheek, but there was no response, so I took her limp hand in mine again. I gazed at the blue sky through the holes in the high ceiling. My mind wandered. \"I wonder what they\u0027ll do if Kyle never comes back. How long will they hide? Will they have to find a new home somewhere else? There are so many of them... It won\u0027t be easy. I wish I could help them, but even if I could stay, I don\u0027t have any answers. \"Maybe they\u0027ll get to stay here... somehow. Maybe Kyle won\u0027t mess up.\" I laughed humorlessly, thinking of the odds. Kyle wasn\u0027t a careful man. However, until that situation was resolved, I was needed. Maybe, if there were Seekers looking, they would need my infallible eyes. It might take a long time, and that made me feel warmer than the sun on my skin. Made me feel grateful that Kyle was impetuous and selfish. How long until we were sure we were safe? \"I wonder what it\u0027s like here when it gets cold. I can barely re-member feeling cold. And what if it rains? It has to rain here sometime, doesn\u0027t it? With all these holes in the roof, it must get really wet. Where does everyone sleep then, I wonder.\" I sighed. \"Maybe I\u0027ll get to find out. Probably shouldn\u0027t bet on that, though. Aren\u0027t you curious at all? If you would wake up, you could get the answers. I\u0027m curious. Maybe I\u0027ll ask Ian about it. It\u0027s funny to imagine things changing here... I guess summer can\u0027t last forever.\" Her fingers fluttered for one second in my hand. It took me by surprise because my mind had wandered away from the woman on the cot, beginning to sink into the melancholy that was always conveniently near these days. I stared down at her; there was no change-the hand in mine was limp, her face still vacant. Maybe I\u0027d imagined the movement. \"Did I say something you were interested in? What was I talking about?\" I thought quickly, watching her face. \"Was it the rain? Or was it the idea of change? Change? You\u0027ve got a lot of that ahead of you, don\u0027t you? You have to wake up first, though.\" Her face was empty, her hand motionless. \"So you don\u0027t care for change. Can\u0027t say that I blame you. I don\u0027t want change to come, either. Are you like me? Do you wish the summer could last?\" If I hadn\u0027t been watching her face so closely, I wouldn\u0027t have seen the tiny flicker of her lids. \"You like summertime, do you?\" I asked hopefully. Her lips twitched. \"Summer?\" Her hand trembled. \"Is that your name-Summer? Summer? That\u0027s a pretty name.\" Her hand tightened into a fist, and her lips parted. \"Come back, Summer. I know you can do it. Summer? Listen to me, Summer. Open your eyes, Summer.\" Her eyes blinked rapidly. \"Doc!\" I called over my shoulder. \"Doc, wake up!\" \"Huh?\" \"I think she\u0027s coming around!\" I turned back to the woman. \"Keep it up, Summer. You can do this. I know it\u0027s hard. Summer, Summer, Summer. Open your eyes.\" Her face grimaced-was she in pain? \"Bring the No Pain, Doc. Hurry.\" The woman squeezed my hand, and her eyes opened. They didn\u0027t focus at first, just whirled around the bright cave. What a strange, unexpected sight this place must have been for her. \"You\u0027re going to be all right, Summer. You\u0027re going to be fine. Can you hear me, Summer?\" Her eyes wheeled back to me, the pupils constricting. She stared, absorbing my face. Then she cringed away from me, twisting on the cot to escape. A low, hoarse cry of panic broke through her lips. \"No, no, no,\" she cried. \"No more.\" \"Doc!\" He was there, on the other side of the cot, like before, when we were operating. \"It\u0027s okay, ma\u0027am,\" he assured her. \"No one is going to hurt you here.\" The woman had her eyes squeezed shut, and she recoiled into the thin mattress. \"I think her name is Summer.\" He flashed a look at me and then made a face. \"Eyes, Wanda,\" he breathed. I blinked and realized that the sun was on my face. \"Oh.\" I let the woman pull her hand free. \"Don\u0027t, please,\" the woman begged. \"Not again.\" \"Shh,\" Doc murmured. \"Summer? People call me Doc. No one\u0027s going to do anything to you. You\u0027re going to be fine.\" I eased away from them, into the shadows. \"Don\u0027t call me that!\" the woman sobbed. \"That\u0027s not my name! It\u0027s hers, it\u0027s hers! Don\u0027t say it again!\" I\u0027d gotten the wrong name. Mel objected to the guilt that washed through me. It\u0027s not your fault. Summer is a human name, too. \"Of course not,\" Doc promised. \"What is your name?\" \"I-I-I don\u0027t know!\" she wailed. \"What happened? Who was I? Don\u0027t make me be someone else again.\" She tossed and thrashed on the cot. \"Calm down; it\u0027s going to be okay, I promise. No one\u0027s going to make you be anyone but you, and you\u0027ll remember your name. It\u0027s going to come back.\" \"Who are you?\" she demanded. \"Who\u0027s she? She\u0027s like... like I was. I saw her eyes!\" \"I\u0027m Doc. And I\u0027m human, just like you. See?\" He moved his face into the light and blinked at her. \"We\u0027re both just ourselves. There are lots of humans here. They\u0027ll be so happy to meet you.\" She cringed again. \"Humans! I\u0027m afraid of humans.\" \"No, you\u0027re not. The... person who used to be in your body was afraid of humans. She was a soul, remember that? And then remember before that, before she was there? You were human then, and you are again.\" \"I can\u0027t remember my name,\" she told him in a panicked voice. \"I know. It\u0027ll come back.\" \"Are you a doctor?\" \"I am.\" \"I was... she was, too. A... Healer. Like a doctor. She was Summer Song. Who am I?\" \"We\u0027ll find out. I promise you that.\" I edged toward the exit. Trudy would be a good person to help Doc, or maybe Heidi. Someone with a calming face. \"She\u0027s not human!\" the woman whispered urgently to Doc, her eye caught by my movement. \"She\u0027s a friend; don\u0027t be afraid. She helped me bring you back.\" \"Where is Summer Song? She was scared. There were humans...\" I ducked out the door while she was distracted. I heard Doc answer the question behind me. \"She\u0027s going to a new planet. Do you remember where she was before she came here?\" I could guess what her answer would be from the name. \"She was... a Bat? She could fly... She could sing... I remember... but it was... not here. Where am I?\" I hurried down the hall to find help for Doc. I was surprised when I saw the light of the great cavern ahead-surprised because it was so quiet. Usually you could hear voices before you saw the light. It was the middle of the day. There should have been someone in the big garden room, if only crossing through. I walked out into the bright noon light, and the giant space was empty. The fresh tendrils of the cantaloupe vines were dark green, darker than the dry earth they sprang from. The earth was too dry-the irrigating barrel stood ready to fix that, the hoses laid out along the furrows. But no one manned the crude machine. It sat abandoned on the side of the field. I stood very still, trying to hear something. The huge cavern was silent, and the silence was ominous. Where was everyone? Had they evacuated without me? A pang of fear and hurt shot through me. But they wouldn\u0027t have left without Doc, of course. They would never leave Doc. I wanted to dart back through the long tunnel to make sure Doc had not disappeared, too. They wouldn\u0027t go without us, either, silly. Jared and Jamie and Ian wouldn\u0027t leave us behind. You\u0027re right. You\u0027re right. Let\u0027s... check the kitchen? I jogged down the silent corridor, getting more anxious as the silence continued. Maybe it was my imagination, and the loud thumping of my pulse in my ears. Of course there must be something to hear. If I could calm down and slow my breathing, I\u0027d be able to hear voices. But I reached the kitchen and it was empty, too. Empty of people. On the tables, half-eaten lunches had been abandoned. Peanut butter on the last of the soft bread. Apples and warm cans of soda. My stomach reminded me that I hadn\u0027t eaten at all today, but I barely noted the twist of hunger. The panic was so much stronger. What if... what if we didn\u0027t evacuate soon enough? No! Mel gasped. No, we would have heard something! Someone would have... or there would be... They\u0027d still be here, looking for us. They wouldn\u0027t give up until they\u0027d checked everywhere. So that can\u0027t be it. Unless they\u0027re looking for us now. I spun back toward the door, my eyes darting through the shadows. I had to go warn Doc. We had to get out of here if we were the last two. No! They can\u0027t be gone! Jamie, Jared... Their faces were so clear, as if they were etched onto the insides of my eyelids. And Ian\u0027s face, as I added my own pictures to hers. Jeb, Trudy, Lily, Heath, Geoffrey. We\u0027ll get them back, I vowed. We\u0027ll hunt them down one by one and steal them back! I won\u0027t let them take my family! If I\u0027d had any doubts where I stood, this moment would have erased them. I\u0027d never felt so fierce in all my lives. My teeth clenched tight, snapping together audibly. And then the noise, the babble of voices I\u0027d been so anxiously straining to hear, echoed down the hall to us and made my breath catch. I slid silently to the wall and pressed myself into the shadow there, listening. The big garden. You can hear it in the echoes. Sounds like a large group. Yes. But yours or mine? Ours or theirs, she corrected. I crept down the hall, keeping to the darkest shadows. We could hear the voices more clearly now, and some of them were familiar. Did that mean anything? How long would it take trained Seekers to perform an insertion? And then, as I reached the very mouth of the great cave, the sounds became even clearer, and relief washed through me-because the babble of voices was just the same as it had been my very first day here. Murderously angry. They had to be human voices. Kyle must be back. Relief warred with pain as I hurried into the bright sunlight to see what was going on. Relief because my humans were safe. And pain because if Kyle was already safely back, then... You\u0027re still needed, Wanda. So much more than I am. I\u0027m sure I could find excuses forever, Mel. There will always be some reason. Then stay. With you as my prisoner? We stopped arguing as we assessed the commotion in the cavern. Kyle was back-the easiest one to spot, the tallest in the crowd, the only one facing me. He was pinned against the far wall by the mob. Though he was the cause of the angry noise, he was not the source of it. His face was conciliatory, pleading. He held his arms out to the sides, palms back, as if there was something behind him he was trying to protect. \"Just calm down, okay?\" His deep voice carried over the cacophony. \"Back off, Jared, you\u0027re scaring her!\" A flash of black hair behind his elbow-an unfamiliar face, with wide, terrified black eyes, peeked around at the crowd. Jared was closest to Kyle. I could see that the back of his neck was bright red. Jamie clung to one of his arms, holding him back. Ian was on his other side, his arms crossed in front of him, the muscles in his shoulders tight with strain. Behind them, every other human but Doc and Jeb was massed in an angry throng. They surged behind Jared and Ian, asking loud, angry questions. \"What were you thinking?\" \"How dare you?\" \"Why\u0027d you come back at all?\" Jeb was in the back corner, just watching. Sharon \u0027s brilliant hair caught my eye. I was surprised to see her, with Maggie, right in the center of the crowd. They\u0027d both been so little a part of life here ever since Doc and I had healed Jamie. Never in the middle of things. It\u0027s the fight, Mel guessed. They weren\u0027t comfortable with happiness, but they\u0027re at home with fury. I thought she was probably right. How... disturbing. I heard a shrill voice throwing out some of the angry questions and realized that Lacey was part of the crowd, too. \"Wanda?\" Kyle\u0027s voice carried across the noise again, and I looked up to see his deep blue eyes locked on me. \"There you are! Could you please come and give me a little help here?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-55.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
