{"id":108458,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"There was a pattern to the wins. If Jared and Kyle played together, they won. If Jared played with Ian, then that team would win. It seemed to me that Jared could not be defeated, until I saw the brothers play together. At first it seemed to be a strained thing, for Ian at least, playing as teammates with Kyle. But after a few minutes of running in the dark, they fell into a familiar pattern-a pattern that had existed since long before I\u0027d come to this planet. Kyle knew what Ian would do before Ian did it, and vice versa. Without having to speak, they told each other everything. Even when Jared pulled all the best players to his side-Brandt, Andy, Wes, Aaron, Lily, and Maggie as goalie-Kyle and Ian were victorious. \"Okay, okay,\" Jeb said, catching Aaron\u0027s goal attempt with one hand and tucking the ball under his arm. \"I think we all know the winners. Now, I hate to be a party pooper, but there\u0027s work waiting... and, to be honest, I\u0027m bushed.\" There were a few halfhearted protests and a few moans, but more laughter. No one seemed too upset to have the fun end. From the way a few people sat down right where they were and put their heads between their knees to breathe, it was clear Jeb wasn\u0027t the only one who was tired out. People began to drift out in twos and threes. I scooted to one side of the corridor\u0027s mouth, making room for them to pass, probably on their way to the kitchen. It had to be past time for lunch, though it was hard to mark the hour in this black hole. Through the gaps in the line of exiting humans, I watched Kyle and Ian. When the game was called, Kyle had raised his hand for a high five, but Ian had stalked past him without acknowledging the gesture. Then Kyle caught his brother\u0027s shoulder and spun him around. Ian knocked Kyle\u0027s hand away. I tensed for a fight-and it seemed like one at first. Kyle threw a punch toward Ian\u0027s stomach. Ian dodged it easily, though, and I saw that there was no force behind it. Kyle laughed and used his superior reach to rub his fist into Ian\u0027s scalp. Ian smacked that hand away, but this time he halfway smiled. \"Good game, bro,\" I heard Kyle say. \"You\u0027ve still got it.\" \"You\u0027re such an idiot, Kyle,\" Ian answered. \"You got the brains; I got the looks. Seems fair.\" Kyle threw another half-strength punch. This time, Ian caught it and twisted his brother into a headlock. Now he was really smiling, and Kyle was cussing and laughing at the same time. It all looked very violent to me; my eyes narrowed, tight with the stress of watching. But at the same time, it brought to mind one of Melanie\u0027s memories: three puppies rolling on the grass, yapping furiously and baring their teeth as if their only desire was to rip out their brothers\u0027 throats. Yes, they\u0027re playing, Melanie confirmed. The bonds of brotherhood go deep. As they should. This is right. If Kyle really doesn\u0027t kill us, this will be a good thing. If, Melanie repeated morosely. \"Hungry?\" I looked up, and my heart stopped beating for a slightly painful moment. It seemed that Jared was still a believer. I shook my head. This gave me the moment I needed to be able to speak to him. \"I\u0027m not sure why, since I\u0027ve done nothing besides sit here, but I\u0027m just tired.\" He held out his hand. Get a hold of yourself, Melanie warned me. He\u0027s just being courteous. You think I don\u0027t know that? I tried to keep my hand from shaking as I reached for his. He pulled me carefully to my feet-to my foot, really. I balanced there on my good leg, not sure how to proceed. He was confused, too. He still held my hand, but there was a wide space between us. I thought of how ridiculous I would look hopping through the caves, and felt my neck get warm. My fingers curled around his, though I wasn\u0027t really using him for support. \"Where to?\" \"Ah...\" I frowned. \"I don\u0027t really know. I suppose there\u0027s still a mat by the ho-in the storage area.\" He frowned back, liking that idea no better than I did. And then a strong arm was under my arms, supporting my weight. \"I\u0027ll get her where she needs to go,\" Ian said. Jared\u0027s face was careful, the way he looked at me when he didn\u0027t want me to know what he was thinking. But he was looking at Ian now. \"We were just discussing where exactly that would be. She\u0027s tired. Maybe the hospital...?\" I shook my head at the same time Ian did. After the past horrible days spent there, I didn\u0027t think I could bear the room I\u0027d once misguidedly feared. Especially Walter\u0027s empty bed... \"I\u0027ve got a better place for her,\" Ian said. \"Those cots aren\u0027t much softer than rock, and she\u0027s got a lot of sore spots.\" Jared still held my hand. Did he realize how tightly he was gripping it? The pressure was starting to get uncomfortable, but he didn\u0027t seem aware. And I certainly wasn\u0027t going to complain. \"Why don\u0027t you get lunch?\" Jared suggested to Ian. \"You look hungry. I\u0027ll take her wherever you had planned...?\" Ian chuckled, a low, dark sound. \"I\u0027m fine. And honestly, Jared, Wanda needs a bit more help than a hand. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re... comfortable enough with the situation to give her that. You see -\" Ian paused to lean down and pull me quickly up into his arms. I gasped as the movement tugged at my side. Jared didn\u0027t free my hand. My fingertips were turning red. \"-she\u0027s actually had enough exercise for one day, I think. You go on ahead to the kitchen.\" They stared at each other while my fingertips turned purple. \"I can carry her,\" Jared finally said in a low voice. \"Can you?\" Ian challenged. He held me out, away from his body. An offer. Jared stared at my face for a long minute. Then he sighed and dropped my hand. Ow, that hurts! Melanie complained. She was referring to the sudden lance of pain that shot through my chest, not the return of blood to my fingers. Sorry. What do you want me to do about it? He\u0027s not yours. Yes. I know that. Ow. Sorry. \"I think I\u0027ll tag along,\" Jared said as Ian, with a tiny, triumphant smile hovering around the edges of his mouth, turned and headed toward the exit. \"There\u0027s something I want to discuss with you.\" \"Suit yourself.\" Jared didn\u0027t discuss anything at all as we walked through the dark tunnel. He was so quiet, I wasn\u0027t sure he was still there. But when we broke out into the light of the cornfield again, he was right beside us. He didn\u0027t speak until we were through the big plaza-until there was no one around but the three of us. \"What\u0027s your take on Kyle?\" he asked Ian. Ian snorted. \"He prides himself on being a man of his word. Usually, I would trust a promise from him. In this situation... I\u0027m not letting her out of my sight.\" \"Good.\" \"It will be fine, Ian,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not afraid.\" \"You don\u0027t have to be. I promise-no one is ever going to do something like this to you again. You will be safe here.\" It was hard to look away from his eyes when they blazed like that. Hard to doubt anything he said. \"Yes,\" Jared agreed. \"You will.\" He was walking just behind Ian\u0027s shoulder. I couldn\u0027t see his expression. \"Thanks,\" I whispered. No one spoke again until Ian paused at the red and gray doors that leaned over the entrance to his cave. \"Would you mind getting that?\" Ian said to Jared, nodding toward the doors. Jared didn\u0027t move. Ian turned around so we could both see him; his face was careful again. \"Your room? This is your better place?\" Jared\u0027s voice was full of skepticism. \"It\u0027s her room now.\" I bit my lip. I wanted to tell Ian that of course this wasn\u0027t my room, but I didn\u0027t get a chance before Jared began questioning him. \"Where\u0027s Kyle staying?\" \"With Wes, for now.\" \"And you?\" \"I\u0027m not exactly sure.\" They stared at each other with appraising eyes. \"Ian, this is -\" I started to say. \"Oh,\" he interrupted, as if just remembering me... as if my weight was so insignificant that he\u0027d forgotten I was here. \"You\u0027re exhausted, aren\u0027t you? Jared, could you get the door, please?\" Wordlessly, Jared wrenched the red door back with a bit too much force and shoved it on top of the gray one. I now really saw Ian\u0027s room for the first time, with the noon sun filtering down through the narrow cracks in the ceiling. It wasn\u0027t as bright as Jamie and Jared\u0027s room, or as tall. It was smaller, more proportionate. Roundish-sort of like my hole, only ten times the size. There were two twin mattresses on the floor, shoved against opposite walls to make a narrow aisle between them. Against the back wall, there was a long, low wooden cupboard; the left side had a pile of clothes on top, two books, and a stack of playing cards. The right side was completely empty, though there were shapes in the dust that indicated this was a recent occurrence. Ian set me carefully down on the right mattress, arranging my leg and straightening the pillow under my head. Jared stood in the doorway, facing the passageway. \"That okay?\" Ian asked me. \"Yes.\" \"You look tired.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t be-I\u0027ve done nothing but sleep lately.\" \"Your body needs sleep to heal.\" I nodded. I couldn\u0027t deny that it was hard to hold up my eyelids. \"I\u0027ll bring you food later-don\u0027t worry about anything.\" \"Thank you. Ian?\" \"Yeah?\" \"This is your room,\" I mumbled. \"You\u0027ll sleep here, of course.\" \"You don\u0027t mind?\" \"Why would I?\" \"It\u0027s probably a good idea-best way to keep an eye on you. Get some sleep.\" \"Okay.\" My eyes were already closed. He patted my hand, and then I heard him get to his feet. A few seconds later, the wooden door clunked softly against stone. What do you think you\u0027re doing? Melanie demanded. What? What did I do now? Wanda, you\u0027re... mostly human. You must realize what Ian will think of your invitation. Invitation? I could see the direction of her thoughts now. It\u0027s not like that. This is his room. There are two beds here. There aren\u0027t enough sleeping areas for me to have my own space. Of course we should share. Ian knows that. Does he? Wanda, open your eyes. He\u0027s starting to... How do I explain it so that you\u0027ll understand right? To feel about you... the way you feel about Jared. Can\u0027t you see that? I couldn\u0027t answer for two heartbeats. That\u0027s impossible, I finally said. \"Do you think what happened this morning will influence Aaron or Brandt?\" Ian asked in a low voice from the other side of the doors. \"You mean Kyle getting a bye?\" \"Yeah. They didn\u0027t have to... do anything before. Not when it looked so likely that Kyle would do it for them.\" \"I see your point. I\u0027ll speak to them.\" \"You think that will be enough?\" Ian asked. \"I\u0027ve saved both their lives. They owe me. If I ask them for something, they\u0027ll do it.\" \"You\u0027d bet her life on that?\" There was a pause. \"We\u0027ll keep an eye on her,\" Jared finally said. Another long silence. \"Aren\u0027t you going to go eat?\" Jared asked. \"I think I\u0027ll hang out here for a bit... How about you?\" Jared didn\u0027t answer. \"What?\" Ian asked. \"Is there something you want to say to me, Jared?\" \"The girl in there...\" Jared said slowly. \"Yes?\" \"That body doesn\u0027t belong to her.\" \"Your point?\" Jared\u0027s voice was hard when he answered. \"Keep your hands off it.\" A low chuckle from Ian. \"Jealous, Howe?\" \"That\u0027s not really the issue.\" \"Really.\" Ian was sarcastic now. \"Wanda seems to be, more or less, cooperating with Melanie. It sounds like they\u0027re almost... on friendly terms. But obviously Wanda\u0027s making the decisions. What if it were you? How would you feel if you were Melanie? What if you were the one... invaded that way? What if you were trapped, and someone else was telling your body what to do? If you couldn\u0027t speak for yourself? Wouldn\u0027t you want your wishes-as much as they could be known-respected? At the very least by other humans?\" \"Okay, okay. Point taken. I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\" \"What do you mean, you\u0027ll keep that in mind?\" Jared demanded. \"I mean that I\u0027ll think about it.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to think about,\" Jared retorted. I knew how he would look from the sound of his voice-teeth clenched, jaw strained. \"The body and the person locked inside it belong to me.\" \"You\u0027re sure that Melanie still feels the -\" \"Melanie will always be mine. And I will always be hers.\" Always. Melanie and I were suddenly at opposite ends of the spectrum. She was flying, elated. I was... not. We waited anxiously through the next silence. \"But what if it were you?\" Ian asked in little more than a whisper. \"What if you were stuffed in a human body and let loose on this planet, only to find yourself lost among your own kind? What if you were such a good... person that you tried to save the life you\u0027d taken, that you almost died trying to get her back to her family? What if you then found yourself surrounded by violent aliens who hated you and hurt you and tried to murder you, over and over again?\" His voice faltered momentarily. \"What if you just kept doing whatever you could to save and heal these people despite that? Wouldn\u0027t you deserve a life, too? Wouldn\u0027t you have earned that much?\" Jared didn\u0027t answer. I felt my eyes getting moist. Did Ian really think so highly of me? Did he really think I\u0027d earned the right to a life here? \"Point taken?\" Ian pressed. \"I-I\u0027ll have to think about that one.\" \"Do that.\" \"But still -\" Ian interrupted him with a sigh. \"Don\u0027t get worked up. Wanda isn\u0027t exactly human, despite the body. She doesn\u0027t seem to respond to... physical contact the same way a human would.\" Now Jared laughed. \"Is that your theory?\" \"What\u0027s funny?\" \"She is quite capable of responding to physical contact,\" Jared informed him, his tone suddenly sober again. \"She\u0027s human enough for that. Or her body is, anyway.\" My face went hot. Ian was silent. \"Jealous, O\u0027Shea?\" \"Actually... I am. Surprisingly so.\" Ian\u0027s voice was strained. \"How would you know that?\" Now Jared hesitated. \"It was... sort of an experiment.\" \"An experiment?\" \"It didn\u0027t go the way I thought it would. Mel punched me.\" I could hear that he was grinning at the memory, and I could see, in my head, the little lines fanning out around his eyes. \"Melanie... punched... you?\" \"It sure wasn\u0027t Wanda. You should have seen her face... What? Hey, Ian, easy, man!\" \"Did you think for one moment what that must have done to her?\" Ian hissed. \"Mel?\" \"No, you fool, Wanda!\" \"Done to Wanda?\" Jared asked, sounding bewildered by the idea. \"Oh, get out of here. Go eat something. Stay away from me for a few hours.\" Ian didn\u0027t give him a chance to answer. He yanked the door out of his way-roughly but very quietly-and then slid into his room and put the door back in its place. He turned and met my gaze. From his expression, he was surprised to find me awake. Surprised and chagrined. The fire in his eyes blazed and then slowly dimmed. He pursed his lips. He cocked his head to one side, listening. I listened, too, but Jared\u0027s retreat made no sound. Ian waited for another moment, then sighed and plunked down on the edge of his mattress, across from me. \"I guess we weren\u0027t as quiet as I thought,\" he said. \"Sound carries in these caves,\" I whispered. He nodded. \"So...\" he finally said. \"What do you think?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-38.html","bookId":2029,"book":{"id":2029,"title":"The Host (The Host #1)","description":"Storyline: The Host is a science fiction/romance novel by Stephenie Meyer.
