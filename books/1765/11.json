{"id":72852,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The tape on Skye\u0027s message machine was full. There were a couple of messages from Senator Weldon\u0027s aide. Almost all of the rest were from Rico. The earlier ones were frustrated, angry, the later ones held fear. Call me. Just call me and let me know you\u0027re okay. Leave a message. Fuck, I can\u0027t shake this feeling that something\u0027s gone bad. Here are my numbers again. The cell phone is always on.\\n\\n She picked up the phone and called his cell. \"Where have you been?\" he demanded as soon as he heard her voice.\\n\\n \"Out of commission.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m coming over.\" He hung up before she could say anything.\\n\\n She called Senator Weldon\u0027s aide. Martin answered the phone promptly and immediately sailed into a rant.\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t had a single report from you! The Senator expects to be kept up to date!\"\\n\\n \"As soon as I finish talking to you, I\u0027m calling Amy\u0027s mother. I need to talk to her-in person. If I can arrange it, it\u0027ll happen tomorrow. You can tell the senator that.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think his sister is alive?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll inform the senator. He\u0027ll expect a progress report after you talk to his stepmother.\"\\n\\n Irritation slithered along Skye\u0027s spine. \"I\u0027ll call when there\u0027s something to report.\"\\n\\n The silence on the other end of the line was heavy with suspicion. \"Getting this matter taken care of is a priority with the senator. I\u0027ll fly in tonight in order to be on hand when you find Amy.\"\\n\\n Skye laughed silently at the thought of taking Weldon\u0027s pompous aide on a hunt. \"That\u0027s a little premature.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be at the Tropicana, but I\u0027m never without my cell. Call me when you find Amy.\"\\n\\n Patrice Weldon answered the phone herself and surprised Skye by saying, \"My husband told me that someone had been hired to look for Amy. Of course I\u0027ll see you. Do you have the address?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"When you know what flight you\u0027re coming in on, let me know. I\u0027ll have a driver waiting for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call you tomorrow morning,\" Skye said, the knock on her door telling her that Rico had arrived.\\n\\n As soon as she opened the door he pressed her against his body in a hug that threatened to re-break her ribs. \"What happened?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"One of my cases went a little sideways and I got hurt.\"\\n\\n He pulled back. \"You\u0027re okay now?\"\\n\\n Skye\u0027s lips quirked up. Except for a few hidden compulsions that she probably needed to find and get rid of. \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Let me see.\" Rico didn\u0027t wait for her to show him. He stripped the shirt from her body, his face a hard mask as soon as he saw the bruising. \"You didn\u0027t go to the hospital. I checked. That\u0027s how crazy I got.\"\\n\\n \"No, a friend took care of me.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to the guy who did this to you?\"\\n\\n \"Do you really want to know?\" Her nipples tightened as Rico smoothed his hand over her body.\\n\\n \"You killed him?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n There was a flash of relief in Rico\u0027s eyes. He moved into her and trailed kisses along her eyelids, down her cheek. \"Fuck, I was scared.\" He gave a shaky laugh against her neck. \"Cia and I were just getting ready to check out a place called Toppers when you called. I took off like a bat out of hell and left her standing next to my desk.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re on duty?\"\\n\\n He crushed her to his body once again, this time burying his face in the silk of her hair. His cock was throbbing, but he didn\u0027t dare fuck her. If he started he\u0027d never be able to stop. \"I had to know that you were okay.\"\\n\\n Soft pleasure raced through Skye\u0027s heart at his words, at the emotion behind them. She turned her head and covered his mouth with hers, teasing his lips open with a kiss meant to convey her own feelings. He cupped her face with his hands and drank in everything she had to offer.\\n\\n When the kiss ended, he muttered, \"If Rivera gets wind of this... Fuck...if it happens, I\u0027ll deal with it. I can\u0027t give this up.\" Rico shuddered and once again pressed his face into her hair. \"I wish I didn\u0027t have to leave.\"\\n\\n Skye brushed her fingers along the front of his jeans, along the heavy ridge of his erection. \"Let me ease you.\"\\n\\n He bucked into her hand and groaned. Without a word he opened his pants and freed his cock. It jutted upward-full and ready, proud.\\n\\n She slid down his body and took the tip of his penis into her mouth, sucking as she explored the slit at its tip with her tongue. He arched and her hands joined in the torment, one circling and pumping his shaft while the other cupped and squeezed his balls.\\n\\n \"Carajo!\" The fierce need to come was already swamping him. His hands buried into her hair, holding her to him, unable to stop himself from thrusting, trying to get more of himself into her mouth.\\n\\n Her hands tightened on his shaft, sending a wave of desire up his spine. His buttocks clenched. \"Swallow me!\"\\n\\n She teased him for several seconds longer, then loosened her hand so that he could slide to the back of her throat. Even then, she didn\u0027t do as he\u0027d commanded until he was shaking with need, ready to beg. With a strangled cry, Rico came when the muscles in her throat clamped down on him as she swallowed.\\n\\n He was panting and dizzy when she pulled back, first cleaning his cock with delicate swirls of her tongue then moving over and covering the mark she\u0027d left on his inner thigh, biting down hard and sharp and sending a fresh wave of desire through him.\\n\\n Rico closed his eyes, fighting to regain control of his body. Fighting the fantasy of her. As soon as the Armstrong case had cooled down, he was going to take some time off and do nothing but fuck her day after day.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to get back to work,\" he groaned, his body radiating reluctance as he tucked his cock back into his pants and zipped up.\\n\\n She stood then and stepped away from him. \"I\u0027m going to LA tomorrow. I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be gone.\"\\n\\n Something tightened in his gut. \"Alone?\"\\n\\n \"Alone.\"\\n\\n Rico drew in a deep breath. Taking her to her knees and fucking her ass had opened a Pandora\u0027s Box of curiosity. Once he would have been satisfied to ram a dildo into her cunt while he pumped in and out of her tight little back entrance. Now he wondered what it would be like to have another man fucking her at the same time, to feel her tighten and stretch, to hear her scream and see her submit as two hot cocks filled her.\\n\\n Blood rushed to his penis at the images flooding his mind. He couldn\u0027t stop the question from escaping. \"What does he look like?\"\\n\\n \"Gian? Dark, like you. But more...aquiline. Midnight eyes and hair that\u0027s long enough to wear in a ponytail. Seductive. Powerful. Addictive. Like you.\"\\n\\n Rico\u0027s nostrils flared at the description, at the picture of her blonde beauty pressed between two dark lovers. He clenched his jaw, wondering if she was seeing the fantasy playing out in his mind, wondering if she shared the fantasy.\\n\\n She half-smiled and sent more blood racing to his cock. \"Do you want to meet him?\" she asked.\\n\\n Carajo! He wasn\u0027t ready to answer that question, to consider all it implied.\\n\\n Los Angeles.\\n\\n Skye had never thought of it as home, even when she lived there.\\n\\n It was a cesspool that only the strongest, the most ruthless, could climb out of. It was a battlefield where souls were destroyed long before the body was left for dead.\\n\\n It was a world of metal detectors and armed guards at school entrances.\\n\\n Of streets filled with voices and music at all hours of the night and day.\\n\\n Of gang colors and gang wars.\\n\\n Of hopelessness and savagery and ugliness.\\n\\n That was Skye\u0027s LA.\\n\\n Amy\u0027s world was far different. It was one of quiet luxury and privilege.\\n\\n Skye was picked up at the airport by a limousine and driven to a house in Pacific Palisades. A maid in uniform showed her to a cozy, private room overlooking the ocean then left after saying, \"Mrs. Weldon will be down shortly.\"\\n\\n The walls of the room were lined with shelves. Most contained books on the occult, but an entire section contained a collection of tarot cards.\\n\\n An elegant woman entered. Her deep red hair was pulled back into a stylish bun. Behind her was an older woman. Something about the second woman caused Skye to still and reach out with her senses. A strong psychic presence surrounded the woman.\\n\\n It gave Skye pause. She trusted herself completely, but never before had her senses touched upon psychic ability.\\n\\n The elegant woman extended a hand. \"I\u0027m Patrice Weldon. Why don\u0027t we have a seat?\"\\n\\n Skye shook the hand. It was warm, firm, the hand of a confident woman.\\n\\n Caution flared in Skye even as Amy\u0027s mother made the introductions. \"This is High Priestess Duvier.\"\\n\\n There was only the briefest hesitation on Skye\u0027s part, an instant where she allowed her instinct for self-preservation to rule, her psyche to recede into a protected space before accepting the Priestess\u0027 hand.\\n\\n The woman smiled with secret knowledge even as she said, \"Your energy is strong. Powerful forces bind you to them.\"\\n\\n A fleeting image of Gian moved through Skye\u0027s mind, but she offered no comment. Releasing the other woman\u0027s hand, Skye sat down on one of the chairs.\\n\\n Patrice and the woman took their places on the sofa. A beautiful mahogany coffee table separated them from Skye.\\n\\n Silently the maid returned with coffee. \"May I?\" Patrice asked.\\n\\n Skye nodded and watched as graceful hands poured coffee for each of them. When a cup was sitting in front of her, she helped herself to sugar and cream. Afterward her eyes strayed to the tarot decks on their tilted display shelves.\\n\\n \"Are you a believer in the Tarot?\" Patrice asked.\\n\\n \"It depends on the practitioner.\"\\n\\n A small smile formed of Patrice\u0027s lips. \"That\u0027s a cautious answer from someone who has unusual skills of their own.\" When Skye didn\u0027t rise to the bait, Amy\u0027s mother continued. \"Your reputation preceded you here. Is everything they say about you true?\"\\n\\n Skye smiled slightly. \"I never listen to what they say.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think my daughter is alive?\" Patrice asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. I also believe that it\u0027s possible there\u0027s someone in Las Vegas that looks like her. What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Did you know that both my husband and my stepson have hired other detectives to try and find Amy?\"\\n\\n Skye shrugged. \"I know other detectives have been involved. They reported that Amy attended black magic ceremonies and became obsessed with the notion of becoming a vampire.\"\\n\\n Patrice snorted inelegantly. \"Skip and his father believe anything from the tarot to devil worship is the occult. They don\u0027t make any distinction between spiritual enlightenment and good magic versus supernatural evil.\"\\n\\n \"You do?\"\\n\\n Patrice stood and walked to the shelf housing the tarot card collection. After a brief pause, she picked up a deck and returned to the sofa. \"I believe powerful forces swirl around us, unseen and untapped. On occasion, I read for myself, but it\u0027s more meditative than true ability. When I seek guidance and help then I look to more knowledgeable practitioners.\" She nodded in the direction of the High Priestess.\\n\\n \"And Amy?\"\\n\\n \"She was also open to mystical teaching and experiences. But like me, she didn\u0027t have a strong psychic talent.\"\\n\\n \"Did you ever talk to Amy about her interest in vampires?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. We had many spirited debates about it. For the last several years she\u0027s been interested in legends about shape shifters and vampires. Amy viewed the legends as alternative histories, a variation of reality that most humans weren\u0027t able to experience or comprehend. She believed in a more literal translation while I believe that vampires and shape shifters are figurative-symbols in our psychic journeys.\"\\n\\n Skye\u0027s mouth twisted into a smile as she thought about the vampire seekers at Fangs. \"Did she ever mention vampire cults or visiting vampire chat rooms on the Internet?\"\\n\\n Patrice chucked. \"God forbid! Vampires on the Internet!\"\\n\\n \"Did she have friends with the same interest?\"\\n\\n Amy\u0027s mother hesitated, just long enough to give lie to her words. \"Not that I\u0027m aware of.\"\\n\\n \"So she never mentioned a girl by the name of Jennifer Warren or Brittany Armstrong?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" The answer was firmer, surer. She might have known there were friends, but she didn\u0027t know their names.\\n\\n \"Did you know about Amy\u0027s plans to empty her trust account and go to Las Vegas?\"\\n\\n \"My husband and stepson seem to think so. Several of their detectives have asked me that question. The answer is unimportant, though. The trust fund was Amy\u0027s to do with as she pleased. Compared to the money my husband has access to, and to the funds in my stepson\u0027s various trust accounts, Amy and I are both poor relations.\"\\n\\n \"So you had no idea what she was up to in Las Vegas?\"\\n\\n Again, the slightest hesitation before answering. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I gather her relationship with both her father and half-brother is strained.\"\\n\\n Once again Patrice gave an inelegant snort. \"There is no relationship.\"\\n\\n \"But you and Amy are close?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I assume that she\u0027s been in contact with you since she disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s certainly your prerogative. You may believe what you wish.\"\\n\\n Skye shifted through her thoughts but found nothing else to ask. Another time, another place, she would have attempted to reach into Patrice\u0027s mind. But instinct warned her against it today. Not with Patrice\u0027s high priestess serving as a psychic mind-guard.\\n\\n \"Thanks for seeing me,\" Skye said as she leaned forward in her seat and prepared to stand.\\n\\n Patrice halted her with a question. \"Do you think that you can find my daughter?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" There was nothing but certainty in Skye\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Patrice\u0027s lips twisted bitterly. \"And then what? Amy disappears again-only this time into some facility that will have no record of who she is and no authority to ever let her out again? Or perhaps you\u0027ve already been paid to simply kill her. My husband and stepson have always used money to pay for silence and convenience.\"\\n\\n Skye smiled only slightly. The hell of her own childhood had created a flame in her soul that burned mercilessly. \"I can\u0027t tell you what\u0027s going to happen to your daughter-not until I find her.\"\\n\\n When Patrice would have risen to show Skye out, the High Priestess stopped her with a brief touch to her arm. \"If I may?\"\\n\\n Amy\u0027s mother said, \"Of course. This is more your realm than mine.\"\\n\\n The High Priestess nodded then turned her attention to Skye. \"You shield yourself well. But even without the mark of one dedicated to the hunt, I know you as Angelini. Be warned, to kill one who gives life to others through black magic may be to kill those enthralled, whether they are good or evil. The Angelini have always prided themselves on being dispensers of justice.\"\\n\\n Angelini. The word whispered through Skye, echoing from the deepest part of her soul, resonating with innate truth. Unbidden, the image of the man she\u0027d encountered at Big Daddy\u0027s house-the man who could be her twin-came to mind. The word had stirred through her mind when she saw the tattoo on his neck.\\n\\n He\u0027d been as wary of her as she\u0027d been of him. He\u0027d evaded her question and the moment had not been right to pursue an answer. But after this hunt was over, she would seek him out.\\n\\n To the High Priestess she said, \"And if there is no time to sort the good from the bad?\"\\n\\n \"If they are truly vampire, truly animated through black magic, then a blade to the heart will suspend judgment.\"\\n\\n Patrice gasped and clutched her throat with an elegant hand.\\n\\n Skye stilled as images of the child molesters, rapists-the vicious predators that she\u0027d hunted-flooded her mind. From the very beginning it had seemed natural to kill them with a knife, to drive it through their hearts in order to ensure they ceased to exist.\\n\\n On top of those memories came snippets of conversations that she\u0027d had with Dawn, Candy and Mike, along with a collage of images featuring the Goth-clad patrons at Fangs.\\n\\n They melded and juxtaposed with the elegant sophistication and power of the High Priestess, blended with images of Haley twisting her ancient pendant and ceding control to Kyle.\\n\\n And superimposed over all of them were vague memories of Gian healing her body, bringing her back when she\u0027d felt death\u0027s familiar presence.\\n\\n Skye had known from an early age that she was not like other people. Was it so much of a stretch to think that other creatures existed?\\n\\n But even as she asked the question and sought answers within herself, she felt the warning tendrils of pain deep in her mind and pulled away from the thoughts.\\n\\n \"I will consider what you\u0027ve said,\" she told the High Priestess.\\n\\n The High Priestess held out her hand to Patrice. \"The deck please.\"\\n\\n Patrice passed the tarot deck to the other woman. The back of the cards bore no pattern but shone like onyx.\\n\\n \"Please, cut the deck,\" the High Priestess said to Skye.\\n\\n Skye studied the deck and the two women in front of her. \"For the answer to a question.\"\\n\\n Without looking at Patrice, the High Priestess answered, \"Of course.\"\\n\\n Skye asked Patrice, \"Have you been in contact with Amy since she supposedly died?\"\\n\\n Patrice glanced at the High Priestess for confirmation. The other woman nodded.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"When?\"\\n\\n \"Later that night. Not since then.\"\\n\\n Skye reached over and cut the deck.\\n\\n The High Priestess turned the top card.\\n\\n The deck was old. Hand-drawn with pen and ink. Unique.\\n\\n A vampire deck.\\n\\n Patrice sobbed when she saw the Death card. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skye-s-trail-the-angelini-1/page-11.html","bookId":1765,"book":{"id":1765,"title":"Skye\u0027s Trail (The Angelini #1)","description":"Storyline: Skye\u0027s Trail (The Angelini #1) \\n For Skye Delano, the hunt and the kill are sometimes inexorably tied together.
