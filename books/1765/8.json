For the first time since he was a rookie, he\u0027d almost crossed the line and used excessive force on a perp.\n Now he waited in Rivera\u0027s office, like a kid sent to the principal\u0027s office. He shifted in his seat, trying to relieve some of the pressure in his dick, and praying that somehow he could make it out of here without getting on the captain\u0027s shit list.\n Carajo! He needed Skye. He needed to shove his cock in her and make her scream. He needed her like he needed to breathe. And that didn\u0027t sit well either.\n He\u0027d known better than to fuck her. He\u0027d known better, and yet he\u0027d do it all over again. He closed his eyes, remembering the taste of her, reliving the moment she\u0027d positioned herself on her hands and knees and spread her legs so that all he could think about was her wet, glistening slit.\n Somehow he had to unload Caldwell, had to convince Rivera that he didn\u0027t need Cia dogging his every step. Shit! If Caldwell hadn\u0027t been with him last night, he\u0027d have dragged Skye into one of the private booths at Bangers and fucked some sense into her. It had pissed him off to see her drinking beer and making deals with a lowlife like Big Daddy.\n Rico shifted again, using his hand this time to try and reposition his cock so that the ache wasn\u0027t so acute. Fuck, he just wanted to get this meeting with Rivera over with so he could find Skye.\n Skye woke to sunlight streaming across her eyelids. Her neck throbbed where the two men in her life had bitten her.\n She sat up, feeling lightheaded. When the sensation passed, she got out of bed and went into the bathroom. The mark on her neck was darker today, an erogenous zone aching to be touched.\n She couldn\u0027t remember when Gian had left or when she\u0027d climbed into bed. She couldn\u0027t remember anything past that moment their minds and bodies had merged in shared ecstasy.\n He was pure sex. Dangerous. Life and death rolled into the same coin. And yet she craved him, knew that she would have to fight both herself and him the next time around. He would own her if she allowed it.\n She stepped into the shower, luxuriating in the hot water that caressed her body. She felt different today, satisfied, well loved. Complete. She stilled at the thought and let herself sink inward.\n The need to be with Rico and Gian was still with her, but the edginess was gone. Skye traced the bite on her neck and her nipples tightened at the touch, like a thousand erotic shockwaves were going through her-all originating from the spot where Gian and Rico had both marked her.\n Her body pulsed with remembered pleasure and she ran her hand over the mark above her heart then massaged her nipples, pulling and squeezing, imagining what it would be like to be with both men at the same time, to have them licking and suckling her before moving down to her cunt, and then filling her with their cocks.\n One hand traveled lower, brushing against the mark inside her thigh before moving to tease her clit, circling and stroking until it stood at attention so that the hot water could lash across it like a fiery tongue. Ripples of pleasure pulsed through Skye, but they were pale imitations of what she\u0027d experienced with Rico and Gian. She covered her clit with her palm and slipped her fingers into her cunt, moving in and out until a small burst of satisfaction eased her.\n As the last of the pleasure faded, Skye felt the hint of compulsion left in her mind by Gian. The need to come to him. To obey him. To give him whatever he wanted.\n She laughed out loud. Amused now. Challenged. Alive. Seduced by the very danger of him.\n As she stood under the hot spray of the shower, she put away the heated memories of their night together and erased the compulsions from her mind.\n The pounding on the door came as she stepped out of the shower.\n \"Skye, let me in!\" Rico yelled.\n She grabbed a robe before moving to the door and opening it for him. His lust rolled across her body in a molten wave, reminding her of a large alpha male, a dark wolf that wanted to mate. His nostrils flared as he devoured her with his eyes.\n Rico\u0027s eyes went unerringly to the spot on her neck. \"You were with him again.\" There was anger in his expression, but pain, too. Skye\u0027s heart rebelled against the sight of it. She moved into Rico, wrapping her arms around his waist and pressing against his body. He stiffened, but didn\u0027t push her away. She needed this, needed the warm press of his skin against hers. It had never been like this before.\n \"I need you both,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not something I can control.\"\n \"And I\u0027m supposed to be happy about that?\"\n \"Not any happier than he is.\"\n \"That\u0027s it? I don\u0027t like it. He doesn\u0027t like it. But you expect us to be okay that you\u0027re fucking us both?\"\n Skye pulled away. An unfamiliar guilt rippled through her. She should have fought the demands of her body, should never have bound him to her.\n \"Do you want me to hypnotize you? Make you forget about being with me? Make the cravings go away, or at least fade?\"\n Rico\u0027s face tightened. \"You\u0027d do it if I said yes?\"\n She searched inside herself and found what it would cost her to let him go, saw the gaping hole it would leave. \"I\u0027ll try if you want me to.\"\n A muscle twitched along his jawline. \"So I can share you or do without, those are my options?\"\n Solemn eyes studied him. \"Can you go to someone else?\"\n Rico\u0027s nostrils flared. He tried to remember the last woman he\u0027d fucked, tried to picture shoving his cock into someone else. It didn\u0027t work. The fire that had his balls ready to explode didn\u0027t want anyone else. It only wanted Skye-here, now.\n Dark desire rushed over him along with fantasies he\u0027d never allowed himself to explore. He pulled her to him and covered her mouth with his, devoured her as he stripped off her robe and pushed his fingers into her already slippery cunt, gathering her juices and spreading them backward, along the cleft of her buttocks, the pucker of her anus.\n Satisfaction ripped through him when she tensed, when he felt the resistance as his finger slid into her back entrance. He opened his jeans and freed his cock. It was rock-hard, the head flushed and dripping with excitement.\n She didn\u0027t fight him as he forced her down onto her hands and knees and covered her body with his. When she opened herself as she\u0027d done before, it was all that Rico could do not to shove himself deep into her cunt.\n \"Oh no,\" he growled as he ran his penis along her slit, bathing it in her juices. \"You want both of us then you\u0027re going to learn to take it this way, too.\" He pressed his cock against the tight rosette of her anus.\n She started to fight him then, but the whimpers she made weren\u0027t the sounds of fear. He held her wrists to the floor and thrust, burying the head of his penis in her.\n Fire breathed across Skye\u0027s nerve endings. Pain and pleasure rushed up her spine as the short digs of his cock pushed him deeper and deeper. She tightened on him, fought him, even as she reveled in his dominance, in his savage demand, in the way he panted and groaned above her.\n Rico pushed against the fierce squeeze of her muscles. Her whimpers and screams and sobs drove him, had him pumping in and out of her, fighting his own release. He freed one of his hands and used it on her clit, nearly screaming himself when she clamped down on him, when her shuddering orgasm caused his testicles to tighten mercilessly before erupting and sending waves of white-hot seed through his cock. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skye-s-trail-the-angelini-1/page-8.html","bookId":1765,"book":{"id":1765,"title":"Skye\u0027s Trail (The Angelini #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Skye\u0027s Trail (The Angelini #1) \n For Skye Delano, the hunt and the kill are sometimes inexorably tied together.
