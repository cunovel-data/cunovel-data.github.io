{"id":71788,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"“Callie…” he groans and his hand starts to go down the front of my jeans as he rolls us to the side. I’m surprised at how much my body wants him to touch me there, so I keep kissing him while little moans escape my lips and I thread my fingers through his hair. His fingers remain just inside my jeans, like he’s testing me, and then finally he slips one inside me.\\n\\n He inches his mouth away for a second to look me in the eyes. “Are you okay?”\\n\\n I’m nervous and scared, but it feels so good. “I’m fine,” I say and the breathlessness of my voice is all the reassurance he needs.\\n\\n His finger start moving as he returns his lips to mine, slipping his tongue inside my mouth as his other hand feels my breast on the outside of my shirt, making a gasp rush out of me. My hips start to writhe up against him and he slides his hand away from my breast down to my thigh, guiding it over his hip so I’m opened up to him.\\n\\n My head tips back against the pillow as I work to catch my breath. He leans back slightly, his finger massaging me from the inside, and he watches me in wonder as every single part of my body rises and falls. Something deep within me bursts with heat and I gasp, trying to hold onto it, but seconds later I come back down to reality.\\n\\n Kayden slides his finger out of me and kisses me gently, his breath hot against my lips. “Are you still good?”\\n\\n I nod my head up and down, my breathing erratic and my skin damp with sweat. “I’m great.”\\n\\n He smiles at my answer and I would probably blush under normal circumstances, but the high in my body still lingers. He lies down on his back with his arm tucked under my neck, his fingers combing through my hair, as he stares at the ceiling with a puzzled expression on his face. “I have to go meet up with Luke. He kept texting me, saying he needed to get the fuck out of the house. I told him I was stopping by here for a few minutes and then I’d be over.”\\n\\n “Oh. Okay.” I’m kind of hurt he’s taking off.\\n\\n “I promise we won’t hang out with him for the whole night.” He climbs off the bed and extends his hand to me. “We can come back here a little later or maybe go catch a movie.”\\n\\n I take his hand and stare up at him. “You want me to go with you?”\\n\\n He lifts me to my feet with his eyebrows dipped. “What? Did you think I just came over here to… to do that to you?”\\n\\n I feel stupid. “Maybe. You were texting me all that stuff out of the blue.” I shrug. “I really don’t know what I was thinking.”\\n\\n He keeps holding my hand as he steps toward the door. “Callie, I’m not using you. The whole texting thing was just my sexual tension catching up with me. If you don’t want to do stuff, you can say so.”\\n\\n “I want to do stuff,” I say. “That night, when that stuff happened, I only panicked because of something you said that reminded me of what happened… with that other thing. It wasn’t because of anything you did.”\\n\\n The worry in his eyes subsides as he brings my wrist to his lips and kisses it delicately. “So we’re good to keep going?”\\n\\n I nod, even though I have no idea where we are going. I’m extremely interested to find out, though, especially after what we just did. I always believed that stuff like that wouldn’t be possible for me; that it would remind me too much of what happened, but all I was thinking about the entire time was Kayden. Everything else left my mind.\\n\\n Chapter 16\\n\\n #7 Do Something Just Because It’s Fun.\\n\\n Kayden\\n\\n I’m worried that I’m getting in too deep. I couldn’t stop thinking about her after Luke and I dropped her off at her house, which is why I had been staying away. The longer I did, the more intense my feelings got. All I could think about was being with her, especially because my dad has been an asshole ever since I got home. He hasn’t hit me, but he doesn’t make it easy to be around him, even just a little amount of time.\\n\\n Finally, I decided to go see Callie because I knew seeing her would make me feel better. I was just going to make it a quick stop, but so many emotions raced through me, I couldn’t control myself and things ended up a little heated. When Callie came, I nearly died. All I wanted to do was rip off her clothes and thrust my cock inside her, feel her everywhere—feel everything. But I’m afraid of what will happen if we cross that line. What it will mean to her—what it will mean to me. My head’s so screwed up. I should walk away from her, but I’m too fucking weak.\\n\\n Callie wanders around the small room in the basement of my house, taking in my trophies and pictures on the wall. She glances at the bed in the corner and then at the leather couches and television. The spot on the wall that I punched has been repaired, like that night never happened. But it did. And part of me is glad it did, because it brought Callie into my life.\\n\\n “So what is this?” she asks curiously. “Like your bachelor pad?”\\n\\n I open the side door that leads to the outside to let in Luke, who ran out to the truck to grab a cooler. My dad’s gone for the night, thankfully and my mom didn’t see us pull in. “I guess that’s what you can call it. Really, it’s just where my brothers and I use to hide out when we were trying to stay invisible.” It’s so strange talking to her openly about it.\\n\\n She sits down on the back of the couch with her legs dangling over the edge. “I wish I had one of these rooms when I was growing up.”\\n\\n “So what the hell are we doing tonight?” Luke stumbles inside carrying a blue cooler, his face is red, and there’s dirt in his hair. “Personally, I’d like to try and not relive the last night we hung out here.”\\n\\n “What happened then?” Callie asks curiously.\\n\\n “Someone got really trashed and ended up getting punched by Dan Zelman.” Luke glances at me as he drops the cooler down on the table. “You were really fucking stupid for picking a fight with him.”\\n\\n I wince at the memory, flexing my hand. “Yeah, that one hurt.”\\n\\n Callie looks at me. “Dan Zelman? He’s like huge. Why would you pick a fight with him?”\\n\\n I shrug, joining her on the back of the couch. “I was drunk.” I lower my voice to a whisper and lean in toward her ear. “And I was upset that I didn’t have the guts to punch someone else earlier that morning.”\\n\\n “Your dad?” she whispers, turning her head and her lips nearly touch mine.\\n\\n I shift my weight uneasily. “Yeah, pretty much.”\\n\\n Luke opens the fridge and beer bottles fall out onto the floor, the glasses clinking together. “Dammit! That wasn’t my fault.”\\n\\n I roll my eyes with exaggeration and Callie giggles. I hop off the couch and go help him pick up the bottles, glad none of them spilled. The last thing I need is for my dad to come down here and find the carpet stained and reeking of beer.\\n\\n After we get them picked up, Luke takes a bottle of Jack Daniels out of the cooler. “Shots all around.”\\n\\n Callie shakes her head, sliding her legs off the couch and jumping onto the floor. “No shots.”\\n\\n I flash her a playful grin. “What? Didn’t you enjoy the last time you got drunk?”\\n\\n “I can’t even remember anything,” she says with a hint of laughter in her voice. “Although, you can. So you tell me. Did I enjoy being drunk?”\\n\\n Grinning, I tuck a lock of her hair behind her ear. “You seemed to.”\\n\\n “It would be really nice if you just told me what I did and said.”\\n\\n “Nah, it’s better if I keep it to myself. Trust me, what you don’t know can’t hurt you.”\\n\\n “I’ll tell you what?” Luke steps forward, unscrewing the cap off the bottle. “We can make it a game. That way, if you’re really good, you won’t ever have to drink.”\\n\\n Callie glances back and forth between us. “What kind of a game?”\\n\\n Luke gives me a sidelong glance and I shake my head, knowing where he’s going with this. “The rules are pretty easy. Someone says something like, I’ve never fallen asleep on the front lawn of the next door neighbor’s house, because I was so fucking drunk I thought it was my house.” He extends the bottle toward me. “And now he has to drink.”\\n\\n I snatch the bottle from him, let my head drop back, and force a large mouthful down my throat. “Thanks for making me the example.”\\n\\n “So what?” Callie asks. “If you’ve done what the person has said, then you have to drink?”\\n\\n I lick the alcohol from my lips. “Yeah, but you don’t have to play. We can just hang out. Luke just thinks everything has to center around alcohol.”\\n\\n Luke yanks the bottle away from my hand, cutting me a harsh look. “That’s not true. I’m just trying to cure my boredom. There’s nothing to do around here now that everyone’s gone.”\\n\\n Callie gives a one-shouldered shrug. “We can play. I haven’t done much of anything, so it seems like the odds are in my favor.”\\n\\n “Yeah, but you don’t know much about us,” Luke says wickedly. “So it’ll be tough for you to come up with things to get us with.”\\n\\n She shrugs again with a look in her eye that makes me wonder if she does know something.\\n\\n We settle on the couch with Callie on one side, and I sit on the other. Luke takes the recliner, kicking his feet up on the coffee table as he takes a drink straight from the bottle.\\n\\n He sets the bottle down on the table. “So, who wants to start?”\\n\\n “I will,” Callie offers, raising her hand.\\n\\n “Really?” I ask her. “Because you don’t have to. You don’t have to be a part of any of this.”\\n\\n She smiles innocently, twisting a strand of her hair around her finger. “I don’t mind. I promise.”\\n\\n “Let her go,” Luke says, draping his arms on the back of the sofa and relaxing back. “I’m really interested to hear what’s going to come out of her mouth.”\\n\\n I motion at the bottle. “Okay, let’s see what you got.”\\n\\n She bites on her lip, mulling it over, and then her eyes lock on Luke. “I’ve never argued with my coach about not being drunk when clearly I was wasted during a game.”\\n\\n Luke’s expression falls. “How did you know about that?”\\n\\n She shrugs. “My dad’s the coach and I hear things.”\\n\\n With his eyes fastened on Callie, he tips his head back and gulps more than a shot out of the bottle. “Okay, so now I’ve got to get back at you.”\\n\\n “Those aren’t the rules!” Callie glances at me for help, her blue eyes enlarging with panic. “Are they?”\\n\\n “They’re my rules.” Luke taps his finger on his chin as he leans forward. “I’ve never stepped on a spray paint can and left a mess on the floor for the checkout guy to clean up.”\\n\\n She rolls her eyes with a smile emerging on her lips, showing a competitive side that I wish was directed at me.\\n\\n Luke dangles the bottle in front of her face, taunting her, and she snatches it from him. Making a disgusted face at it, she puts her lips to the top, leans back, and sucks out a tiny swallow.\\n\\n Gagging, she thrusts the bottle in Luke’s direction with her head turned and her eyes shut. “Oh my God! That’s worse than the vodka.” She shudders as she blinks like crazy. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-coincidence-of-callie-kayden-the-coincidence-1/page-37.html","bookId":1974,"book":{"id":1974,"title":"The Coincidence of Callie \u0026 Kayden (The Coincidence #1)","description":"Storyline: The Coincidence of Callie \u0026 Kayden (The Coincidence #1) \\n For Kayden, suffering in silence was the only way to survive.
