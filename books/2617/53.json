I have a little fantasy in my mind that I cling to when things are dire.”\\n\\n “Oh? Tell me.”\\n\\n Laughing, Cian kissed her lips lovingly. “Do you really want to know?”\\n\\n “Uh huh.” Amaliya slid her fingers under his shirt to stroke his skin.\\n\\n “Okay, here it is.” Cian fastened his intense hazel eyes on her face. “I dream of you. With me. Forever. No one ever comes between us and we experience the beauty of the eternal night side by side. We never part ways, but always find solace in one another.”\\n\\n Amaliya touched his cheek lightly, his words sending a thrill of terror and pleasure through her. “You mean forever...”\\n\\n “I have been in love many times, Amaliya. I have tried to hold onto those loves only to lose them because of the choices I made. But it is different with you. It has been from the beginning. The same way you choose not to run away, I choose not to push you away. I have always betrayed or hurt the ones I love out of the selfish need to ensure my own survival at all costs. But when I look at you, I know I would die for you.”\\n\\n Covering his mouth, Amaliya whispered, “Don\u0027t say that.”\\n\\n Cian pressed his lips to her palm, then drew her hand away. “I will say it, because should I die in defense of you, I want you to know it is because I love you and would do anything for you.”\\n\\n “Like Pete,” Amaliya sighed, lowering her chin and staring at his chest.\\n\\n Tucking his fingers under her jaw, he lifted her face. His hazel eyes gazed into hers. “What is your dream?”\\n\\n The pain that flitted through her was brief, but she accepted its cause. She loved Cian with all her heart and knew what she chose could result in both of them dying. If she was wise, she would run away and spare him, but she knew she couldn\u0027t. To live her life without him was to not live at all. “My dream...” she said in a voice husky with emotion “...is forever.”\\n\\n The smile on Cian\u0027s face warmed her heart even as her blood turned to ice.\\n\\n “And I will destroy anyone or anything that comes between us and that dream coming true.”\\n\\n Cian touched her cheek, his eyes clearly reflecting her own determination. “I understand.”\\n\\n “No, you don’t, Cian.” Amaliya said, her voice rough with pain. “Because I will destroy the world if I have to…” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-kills-pretty-when-she-dies-2/page-53.html","bookId":2617,"book":{"id":2617,"title":"Pretty When She Kills (Pretty When She Dies #2)","description":"Storyline: Pretty When She Kills (Pretty When She Dies #2) \\n Amaliya Vezorak never believed in happy endings… \\n When Amaliya harnessed her necromancer powers to defeat her greatest enemy, she believed she had finally found a happy ending with Cian, her lover and the master of Austin.
