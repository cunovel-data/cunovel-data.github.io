{"id":2630,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 尼 尼 微 阿 ， 那 打 碎 邦 国 的 上 来 攻 击 你 。 你 要 看 守 保 障 ， 谨 防 道 路 ， 使 腰 强 壮 ， 大 大 勉 力 。 [kjv] He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. [bbe] A crusher has come up before your face: keep a good look-out, let the way be watched, make yourself strong, let your power be greatly increased. 2:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 复 兴 雅 各 的 荣 华 ， 好 像 以 色 列 的 荣 华 一 样 。 因 为 使 地 空 虚 的 ， 已 经 使 雅 各 和 以 色 列 空 虚 ， 将 他 们 的 葡 萄 枝 毁 坏 了 。 [kjv] For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. [bbe] For the Lord will make good the vine of Jacob, as well as the vine of Israel: for the wasters have made them waste and sent destruction on the branches of their vine. 2:3 [hgb] 他 勇 士 的 盾 牌 是 红 的 ， 精 兵 都 穿 朱 红 衣 服 。 在 他 预 备 争 战 的 日 子 ， 战 车 上 的 钢 铁 闪 烁 如 火 ， 柏 木 把 的 枪 也 抡 起 来 了 。 [kjv] The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. [bbe] The body-covers of his fighting men have been made red, the men of war are clothed in bright red: the war-carriages are like flames of fire in the day when he gets ready, the horses are shaking. 2:4 [hgb] 车 辆 在 街 上 （ 或 作 城 外 ） 急 行 ， 在 宽 阔 处 奔 来 奔 去 ， 形 状 如 火 把 ， 飞 跑 如 闪 电 。 [kjv] The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. [bbe] The war-carriages are rushing through the streets, pushing against one another in the wide ways, looking like burning lights, running like thunder-flames. 2:5 [hgb] 尼 尼 微 王 招 聚 他 的 贵 胄 。 他 们 步 行 绊 跌 。 速 上 城 墙 ， 预 备 挡 牌 。 [kjv] He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. [bbe] He takes the record of his great men: they go falling on their way; they go quickly to the wall, the cover is made ready. 2:6 [hgb] 河 闸 开 放 ， 宫 殿 冲 没 。 [kjv] The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved. [bbe] The river doorways are forced open, and the king\u0027s house is flowing away. 2:7 [hgb] 王 后 蒙 羞 ， 被 人 掳 去 ， 宫 女 捶 胸 ， 哀 鸣 如 鸽 。 此 乃 命 定 之 事 。 [kjv] And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. [bbe] And the queen is uncovered, she is taken away and her servant-girls are weeping like the sound of doves, hammering on their breasts. 2:8 [hgb] 尼 尼 微 自 古 以 来 充 满 人 民 。 如 同 聚 水 的 池 子 ， 现 在 居 民 却 都 逃 跑 。 虽 有 人 呼 喊 说 ， 站 住 ， 站 住 ， 却 无 人 回 顾 。 [kjv] But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back. [bbe] But Nineveh is like a pool of water whose waters are flowing away; Keep your place, they say; but no one is turning back. 2:9 [hgb] 你 们 抢 掠 金 银 吧 。 因 为 所 积 蓄 的 无 穷 ， 华 美 的 宝 器 无 数 。 [kjv] Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture. [bbe] Take silver, take gold; for there is no end to the store; take for yourselves a weight of things to be desired. 2:10 [hgb] 尼 尼 微 现 在 空 虚 荒 凉 ， 人 心 消 化 ， 双 膝 相 碰 ， 腰 都 疼 痛 ， 脸 都 变 色 。 [kjv] She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. [bbe] Everything has been taken from her, all is gone, she has nothing more: the heart is turned to water, the knees are shaking, all are twisted in pain, and colour has gone from all faces. 2:11 [hgb] 狮 子 的 洞 和 少 壮 狮 子 喂 养 之 处 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 公 狮 母 狮 小 狮 游 行 ， 无 人 惊 吓 之 地 在 哪 里 呢 ？ [kjv] Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion\u0027s whelp, and none made them afraid? [bbe] Where is the lions\u0027 hole, the place where the young lions got their food, where the lion and the she-lion were walking with their young, without cause for fear? 2:12 [hgb] 公 狮 为 小 狮 撕 碎 许 多 食 物 ， 为 母 狮 掐 死 活 物 ， 把 撕 碎 的 ， 掐 死 的 充 满 它 的 洞 穴 。 [kjv] The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. [bbe] Food enough for his young and for his she-lions was pulled down by the lion; his hole was full of flesh and his resting-place stored with meat. 2:13 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 与 你 为 敌 ， 必 将 你 的 车 辆 焚 烧 成 烟 ， 刀 剑 也 必 吞 灭 你 的 少 壮 狮 子 。 我 必 从 地 上 除 灭 你 所 撕 碎 的 ， 你 使 者 的 声 音 必 不 再 听 见 。 [kjv] Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard. [bbe] See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your war-carriages burned in the smoke, and your young lions will be food for the sword: you will no longer get your food by force on the earth, and the voice of your she-lions will be stopped for ever.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/145/2068.html","bookId":110,"book":{"id":110,"title":"那鸿书 Nahum","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 论 尼 尼 微 的 默 示 ， 就 是 伊 勒 歌 斯 人 那 鸿 所 得 的 默 示 。 [kjv] The burden of Nineveh.
