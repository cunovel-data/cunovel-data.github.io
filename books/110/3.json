{"id":2631,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"3:1 [hgb] 祸 哉 ， 这 流 人 血 的 城 ， 充 满 谎 诈 和 强 暴 。 抢 夺 的 事 ， 总 不 止 息 。 [kjv] Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not; [bbe] A curse is on the town of blood; it is full of deceit and violent acts; and there is no end to the taking of life. 3:2 [hgb] 鞭 声 响 亮 ， 车 轮 轰 轰 ， 马 匹 踢 跳 ， 车 辆 奔 腾 ， [kjv] The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. [bbe] The noise of the whip, and the noise of thundering wheels; horses rushing and war-carriages jumping, 3:3 [hgb] 马 兵 争 先 ， 刀 剑 发 光 ， 枪 矛 闪 烁 ， 被 杀 的 甚 多 ， 尸 首 成 了 大 堆 ， 尸 骸 无 数 ， 人 碰 着 而 跌 倒 。 [kjv] The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: [bbe] Horsemen driving forward, and the shining sword and the bright spear: and a great number of wounded, and masses of dead bodies; they are falling over the bodies of the dead: 3:4 [hgb] 都 因 那 美 貌 的 妓 女 多 有 淫 行 ， 惯 行 邪 术 ， 借 淫 行 诱 惑 列 国 ， 用 邪 术 诱 惑 多 族 （ 诱 惑 原 文 作 卖 ） 。 [kjv] Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. [bbe] Because of all the false ways of the loose woman, expert in attraction and wise in secret arts, who takes nations in the net of her false ways, and families through her secret arts. 3:5 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 与 你 为 敌 。 我 必 揭 起 你 的 衣 襟 ， 蒙 在 你 脸 上 ， 使 列 国 看 见 你 的 赤 体 ， 使 列 邦 观 看 你 的 丑 陋 。 [kjv] Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. [bbe] See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your skirts pulled over your face, and let the nations see you unclothed, and the kingdoms your shame. 3:6 [hgb] 我 必 将 可 憎 污 秽 之 物 抛 在 你 身 上 ， 辱 没 你 ， 为 众 目 所 观 。 [kjv] And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock. [bbe] I will make you completely disgusting and full of shame, and will put you up to be looked at by all. 3:7 [hgb] 凡 看 见 你 的 ， 都 必 逃 跑 离 开 你 ， 说 ， 尼 尼 微 荒 凉 了 。 有 谁 为 你 悲 伤 呢 ？ 我 何 处 寻 得 安 慰 你 的 人 呢 ？ [kjv] And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? [bbe] And it will come about that all who see you will go in flight from you and say, Nineveh is made waste: who will be weeping for her? where am I to get comforters for her? 3:8 [hgb] 你 岂 比 挪 亚 们 强 呢 ？ 挪 亚 们 坐 落 在 众 河 之 间 ， 周 围 有 水 。 海 作 她 的 濠 沟 （ 海 指 尼 罗 河 ） ， 又 作 她 的 城 墙 。 [kjv] Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea? [bbe] Are you better than No-amon, seated on the Nile streams, with waters all round her; whose wall was the sea and her earthwork the waters? 3:9 [hgb] 古 实 和 埃 及 是 她 无 穷 的 力 量 。 弗 人 和 路 比 族 是 她 的 帮 手 。 [kjv] Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. [bbe] Ethiopia was her strength and Egyptians without number; Put and Lubim were her helpers. 3:10 [hgb] 但 她 被 迁 移 ， 被 掳 去 。 她 的 婴 孩 在 各 市 口 上 也 被 摔 死 。 人 为 她 的 尊 贵 人 拈 阄 ， 她 所 有 的 大 人 都 被 链 子 锁 着 。 [kjv] Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. [bbe] But even she has been taken away, she has gone away as a prisoner: even her young children are smashed to bits at the top of all the streets: the fate of her honoured men is put to the decision of chance, and all her great men are put in chains. 3:11 [hgb] 你 也 必 喝 醉 ， 必 被 埋 藏 。 并 因 仇 敌 的 缘 故 寻 求 避 难 所 。 [kjv] Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy. [bbe] And you will be overcome with wine, you will become feeble; you will be looking for a safe place from those who are fighting against you. 3:12 [hgb] 你 一 切 保 障 ， 必 像 无 花 果 树 上 初 熟 的 无 花 果 。 若 一 摇 撼 ， 就 落 在 想 吃 之 人 的 口 中 。 [kjv] All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater. [bbe] All your walled places will be like fig-trees and your people like the first figs, falling at a shake into the mouth which is open for them. 3:13 [hgb] 你 地 上 的 人 民 ， 如 同 妇 女 。 你 国 中 的 关 口 ， 向 仇 敌 敞 开 。 你 的 门 闩 被 火 焚 烧 。 [kjv] Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. [bbe] See, the people who are in you are women; the doorways of your land are wide open to your attackers: the locks of your doors have been burned away in the fire. 3:14 [hgb] 你 要 打 水 预 备 受 困 。 要 坚 固 你 的 保 障 。 踹 土 和 泥 ， 修 补 砖 窑 。 [kjv] Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. [bbe] Get water for the time when you are shut in, make strong your towns: go into the potter\u0027s earth, stamping it down with your feet, make strong the brickworks. 3:15 [hgb] 在 那 里 ， 火 必 烧 灭 你 ， 刀 必 杀 戮 你 ， 吞 灭 你 如 同 蝻 子 。 任 你 加 增 人 数 多 如 蝻 子 ， 多 如 蝗 虫 吧 。 [kjv] There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. [bbe] There the fire will make you waste; you will be cut off by the sword: make yourself as great in number as the worms, as great in number as the locusts. 3:16 [hgb] 你 增 添 商 贾 ， 多 过 天 上 的 星 。 蝻 子 吃 尽 而 去 。 [kjv] Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. [bbe] Let your traders be increased more than the stars of heaven: 3:17 [hgb] 你 的 首 领 ， 多 如 蝗 虫 ， 你 的 军 长 ， 仿 佛 成 群 的 蚂 蚱 ， 天 凉 的 时 候 ， 齐 落 在 篱 笆 上 ， 日 头 一 出 便 都 飞 去 ， 人 不 知 道 落 在 何 处 。 [kjv] Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. [bbe] Your crowned ones are like the locusts, and your scribes like the clouds of insects which take cover in the walls on a cold day, but when the sun comes up they go in flight, and are seen no longer in their place. 3:18 [hgb] 亚 述 王 阿 ， 你 的 牧 人 睡 觉 ， 你 的 贵 胄 安 歇 。 你 的 人 民 散 在 山 间 ， 无 人 招 聚 。 [kjv] Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them. [bbe] Sorrow! how are the keepers of your flock sleeping, O king of Assyria! your strong men are at rest; your people are wandering on the mountains, and there is no one to get them together. 3:19 [hgb] 你 的 损 伤 无 法 医 治 ， 你 的 伤 痕 极 其 重 大 。 凡 听 你 信 息 的 ， 必 都 因 此 向 你 拍 掌 。 你 所 行 的 恶 ， 谁 没 有 时 常 遭 遇 呢 ？ [kjv] There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually? [bbe] Your pain may not be made better; you are wounded to death: all those hearing the news about you will be waving their hands in joy over you: for who has not undergone the weight of your evil-doing again and again?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/145/2069.html","bookId":110,"book":{"id":110,"title":"那鸿书 Nahum","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 论 尼 尼 微 的 默 示 ， 就 是 伊 勒 歌 斯 人 那 鸿 所 得 的 默 示 。 [kjv] The burden of Nineveh.
