{"id":29314,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER III LORD ROBERTS\u0027S WARNINGS","content":"Lord Roberts addressed many meetings in favour of National Service during the years which followed his return from South Africa in 1905; but the first of his speeches to arrest widespread popular attention was delivered in the Free Trade Hall at Manchester, on October 22, 1912. A popular audience filled the building to overflowing, listened with respect, and appeared to accept his conclusions with enthusiasm. His words carried far beyond the walls of the meeting-place, and caused something approaching a sensation, or, as some thought, a scandal, in political circles. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the commentators upon this speech the greater part were Liberals, and these condemned his utterances with unanimity in somewhat violent language. Official unionism was dubious, uncomfortable, and disapproving: it remained for the most part dumb. A few voices were raised from this quarter in open reprobation; a few others proclaimed their independence of party discipline and hastened to approve his sentiments. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no doubt of one thing—Lord Roberts\u0027s speech had at last aroused public interest. For the first time during the National Service agitation {333} blood had been drawn. This was mainly due to the object-lesson in the consequences of military unpreparedness, which the first Balkan War was just then unfolding before the astonished eyes of Europe. In addition, those people, who for a year past had been puzzling their heads over the true meaning of the Agadir crisis, had become impressed with the urgent need for arriving at a clear decision with regard to the adequacy of our national defences. \\n\\n \\n\\n NEED FOR NATIONAL SERVICE \\n\\n \\n\\n The speech was a lucid and forcible statement of the need for compulsory military training. It was interesting reading at the time it was delivered, and in some respects it is even more interesting to-day. It was compactly put together, not a thing of patches. A man who read any part of it would read it all. Yet in accordance with custom, controversy raged around three isolated passages. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first of these runs as follows: \"In the year 1912, our German friends, I am well aware, do not—at least in sensible circles—assert dogmatically that a war with Great Britain will take place this year or next; but in their heart of hearts they know, every man of them, that—just as in 1866 and just as in 1870—war will take place the instant the German forces by land and sea are, by their superiority at every point, as certain of victory as anything in human calculation can be made certain. Germany strikes when Germany\u0027s hour has struck. That is the time-honoured policy of her Foreign Office. That was the policy relentlessly pursued by Bismarck and Moltke in 1866 and 1870. It has been her policy decade by decade since that date. It is her policy at the present hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n {334} \\n\\n \\n\\n The second passage followed upon the first: \"It is an excellent policy. It is or should be the policy of every nation prepared to play a great part in history. Under that policy Germany has, within the last ten years, sprung, as at a bound, from one of the weakest of naval powers to the greatest naval power, save one, upon this globe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The third passage came later: \"Such, gentlemen, is the origin, and such the considerations which have fostered in me the growth of this conviction—the conviction that in some form of National Service is the only salvation of this Nation and this Empire. The Territorial Force is now an acknowledged failure—a failure in discipline, a failure in numbers, a failure in equipment, a failure in energy.\"[1] \\n\\n \\n\\n The accuracy of the first and third of these statements now stands beyond need of proof. It was not truer that Germany would strike so soon as her rulers were of opinion that the propitious hour had struck, than it was that, when the British Government came to take stock of their resources at the outbreak of war, they would find the Territorial Army to be lacking in the numbers, equipment, training, and discipline, which alone could have fitted it for its appointed task—the defence of our shores against invasion. Slowly, and under great difficulties, and amid the gravest anxieties these defects had subsequently to be made good, hampering the while our military operations in the critical sphere. \\n\\n \\n\\n The second statement was of a different character, and taken by itself, without reference to the context, lent itself readily to misconception as well as {335} misconstruction. A certain number of critics, no doubt, actually believed, a still larger number affected to believe, that Lord Roberts was here advocating the creation of a British army, for the purpose of attacking Germany, without a shred of justification, and at the first favourable moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole tenor of this speech, however, from the first line to the last, made it abundantly clear that in Lord Roberts\u0027s opinion Britain could have neither motive nor object for attacking Germany; that the sole concern of England and of the British Empire with regard to Germany was, how we might defend our possessions and secure ourselves against her schemes of aggression. \\n\\n \\n\\n POINTS OF CRITICISM \\n\\n \\n\\n Lord Roberts, however, had in fact pronounced the intentions which he attributed to Germany to be \u0027an excellent policy,\u0027 and had thereby seemed to approve, and recommend for imitation, a system which was revolting to the conscience of a Christian community. \\n\\n \\n\\n The idea that Lord Roberts could have had any such thoughts in his mind seemed merely absurd to any one who knew him; nay, it must also have seemed inconceivable to any one who had taken the trouble to read the speech itself in an unprejudiced mood. To an ordinary man of sense it did not need Lord Roberts\u0027s subsequent letter of explanation[2] to set his opinions in their true light. It was clear that his object, in this \u0027peccant passage,\u0027 had merely been to avoid a pharisaical condemnation of German methods and ambitions, and to treat that country as a worthy, as well as a formidable, antagonist. Being a soldier, {336} however,—not a practised platform orator alive to the dangers of too-generous concession—he went too far. The words were unfortunately chosen, seeing that so many critics were on the watch, not to discover the true meaning of the speech, but to pounce on any slip which might be turned to the disadvantage of the speaker. \\n\\n \\n\\n At first there was an attempt on the part of certain London[3] Liberal journals to boycott this speech. Very speedily, however, it seemed to dawn upon them that they had greater advantages to gain by denouncing it. A few days later, accordingly, the torrent of condemnation was running free. The ablest attack appeared in the Nation,[4] and as this pronouncement by the leading Radical weekly was quoted with approval by the greater part of the ministerial press throughout the country, it may fairly be taken as representing the general view of the party. \\n\\n \\n\\n A RADICAL ATTACK \\n\\n \\n\\n The article was headed A Diabolical Speech, and its contents fulfilled the promise of the title. \"There ought,\" said the writer, \"to be some means of bringing to book a soldier, in the receipt of money from the State, who speaks of a friendly Power as Lord Roberts spoke of Germany.\" He was accused roundly of predicting and encouraging a vast and \u0027hideous conflict\u0027 between the two countries. Lord Roberts was a \u0027successful\u0027[5] {337} soldier; but \u0027without training in statesmanship.\u0027 He \u0027had never shown any gift for it.\u0027 His was \u0027an average Tory intellect.\u0027 He was a \u0027complete contrast to Wellington, who possessed two great qualities; for \"he set a high value on peace, and he knew how to estimate and bow to the governing forces of national policy.... Lord Roberts possesses neither of these attributes. He is a mere jingo in opinion and character, and he interprets the life and interests of this nation and this Empire by the crude lusts and fears which haunt the unimaginative soldier\u0027s brain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We may pause at this breathing-place to take note of the healing influences of time. Radical journalists of 1832, and thereabouts, were wont to say very much the same hard things of the Duke of Wellington, as those of 1912 saw fit to apply to Earl Roberts.... We may also remark in passing, upon the errors to which even the most brilliant of contemporary judgments are liable. There has never been a man in our time who set a higher value on peace than Lord Roberts did. He realised, however, not only the intrinsic value of peace, but its market cost. His real crime, in the eyes of pacifists, was that he stated publicly, as often as he had the chance, what price we must be prepared to pay, if we wanted peace and not war. It was in this sense, no doubt, that he did not know \u0027how to estimate and bow to the governing forces of national policy.\u0027 His blunt warnings broke in rudely and crudely upon the comfortable discourse of the three counsellors—Simple, Sloth, and Presumption, who, better than any others, were skilled in estimating the \u0027governing forces,\u0027 and the advantages to be gained by bowing to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n {338} \\n\\n \\n\\n The writer in the Nation then proceeded to riddle Lord Roberts\u0027s theories of defence. \"He desires us to remain a \u0027free nation\u0027 in the same breath that he invites us to come under the yoke of conscription\"—intolerable, indeed, that the citizens of a free nation should be ordered to fit themselves for defending their common freedom—\"conscription, if you please, for the unheard-of purpose of overseas service in India and elsewhere....\" This invitation does not seem to be contained in this, or any other of Lord Roberts\u0027s speeches; but supposing it to have been given, it was not altogether \u0027unheard-of,\u0027 seeing that, under the law of conscription prevalent (for example) in Germany, conscript soldiers can be sent to Palestine, or tropical Africa as lawfully as into Luxemburg, Poland, or France. According to the Nation, the true theory of defence was Sea Power; but this, it appeared, could not be relied on for all time.... \"While our naval monopoly—like our commercial monopoly—cannot exist for ever, our sea power and our national security depend on our ability to crush an enemy\u0027s fleet.... We were never so amply insured—so over-insured—against naval disaster as we are to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A LIBERAL ATTACK \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord Roberts\u0027s proposition, therefore,\" the writer continued, \"is merely foolish; it is his way of commending it, which is merely wicked. He speaks of war as certain to take place \u0027the instant\u0027 the German forces are assured of \u0027superiority at every point,\u0027 and he discovers that the motto of German foreign policy is that Germany strikes when Germany\u0027s hour has struck. Germany does not happen to have struck anybody since 1870, and she struck then to secure national unity, and to put an end to {339} the standing menace of French imperialism. Since then she has remained the most peaceful and the most self-contained, though doubtless not the most sympathetic, member of the European family.... Germany, the target of every cheap dealer in historic slapdash, is in substance the Germany of 1870\" (i.e. in extent of territory), \"with a great industrial dominion superadded by the force of science and commercial enterprise. That is the story across which Lord Roberts scrawls his ignorant libel.... By direct implication he invites us to do to Germany what he falsely asserts she is preparing to do to us. These are the morals, fitter for a wolf-pack than for a society of Christian men, commended as \u0027excellent policy\u0027 to the British nation in the presence of a Bishop of the Anglican Church.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was very vigorous writing; nor was there the slightest reason to suspect its sincerity. In the nature of man there is a craving to believe; and if a man happens to have his dwelling-place in a world of illusion and unreality, it is not wonderful that he should believe in phantoms. The credulity of the Nation might appear to many people to amount to fanaticism; but its views were fully shared, though less tersely stated, by the whole Liberal party, by the greater proportion of the British people, and not inconceivably by the bulk of the unionist opposition as well. The Government alone, who had learned the true facts from Lord Haldane eight months earlier, knew how near Lord Roberts\u0027s warnings came to the mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n This article set the tone of criticism. The Manchester Guardian protested against the \"insinuation that the German Government\u0027s views of international {340} policy are less scrupulous and more cynical than those of other Governments.\" Germany has never been accused with justice \"of breaking her word, of disloyalty to her engagements, or of insincerity. Prussia\u0027s character among nations is, in fact, not very different from the character which Lancashire men give to themselves as compared with other Englishmen. It is blunt, straightforward, and unsentimental....\" How foolish, moreover, are our fears of Germany when we come to analyse them. \"We have no territory that she could take, except, in tropical Africa, which no sane man would go to war about. Our self-governing colonies could not in any case be held by force; and Canada is protected in addition by the Monroe doctrine. Egypt is not ours to cede. Malta could not be had without war with Italy nor India without war with Russia.\"[6] \\n\\n \\n\\n This was a proud statement of the basis of British security, and one which must have warmed the hearts, and made the blood of Cromwell and Chatham tingle in the shades. Egypt, which we had rescued from a chaos of civil war, bankruptcy, and corruption, which during more than thirty years we had administered as just stewards for the benefit of her people, which we had saved from conquest and absorption by savage hordes—Egypt was not ours to cede. For the rest our dependencies were not worth taking from us, while our \u0027colonies\u0027 could defend themselves. By the grace of Italy\u0027s protection we should be secured in the possession of Malta. India would be preserved to us by the goodwill of Russia, and Canada by the strong arm of the United States.... {341} Such at that time were the views of the Liberal journal foremost in character and ability. \\n\\n \\n\\n A unionIST ATTACK \\n\\n \\n\\n Somewhat later the Daily News took the field, making up for lost time by an exuberance of misconstruction.... \"The whole movement as represented by the National Service League is definitely unmasked as an attempt to get up, not defence, but an invasion of German territory. This discovery, which for years has been suspected, is most valuable as showing up the real object of the League, with its glib talk about military calisthenics. Lord Roberts may have been indiscreet, but at least he has made it clear that what the League wants is war.\"[7] \\n\\n \\n\\n On the same day, in order that the Liberals might not have a monopoly of reprobation, the Evening Standard, in an article entitled A Word with Lord Roberts, rated him soundly for having \"made an attack upon Germany and an attack upon the Territorial Force....\" \"It is mere wanton mischief-making for a man with Lord Roberts\u0027s unequalled prestige to use words which must drive every German who reads them to exasperation.\" And yet no signs whatsoever were forthcoming that so much as a single Teuton had been rendered desperate, or had taken the words as in the least degree uncomplimentary. Up to the day of his death—and indeed after his death[8]—Lord Roberts was almost the only Englishman of his time of whom Germans spoke with consistent respect.... \"Do not,\" continues this lofty and sapient mentor, \"Do not let us talk as if the Kaiser could play the part of a Genghis Khan or an Attila, ravening round the world at the head of armed {342} hordes to devour empires and kingdoms.\"[9] And yet how otherwise has the whole British Press been talking ever since the middle of August 1914? If during this period of nine months, the Evening Standard has kept all reference to Attila and his Huns out of its columns, its continence is unique. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would serve no useful purpose to set out further items of criticism and abuse from the leader and correspondence columns of newspapers, or from the speeches of shocked politicians. The Nation, the Manchester Guardian, and the Daily News are entitled, between them, to speak for the Liberal party; and if it cannot be said that the Evening Standard is quite similarly qualified in respect of the unionists, there is still no doubt that the views which it expressed with so much vigour, prescience, and felicity were held by many orthodox members of its party. \\n\\n \\n\\n Colonel Bromley-Davenport, for example, who had been Financial Secretary to the War Office in the late unionist Government, spoke out strongly against Lord Roberts\u0027s comments upon the efficiency of the Territorial Force. \u0027Compulsory service,\u0027 in his opinion, \u0027was not necessary....\u0027 And then, with a burst of illuminating candour—\"Which of the great parties in the state would take up compulsory service and fight a general election upon it? The answer was that neither of the parties would; and to ask for compulsory military service was like crying for the moon.\"[10] The power of any proposal for winning elections was to be the touchstone of its truth. It would be impossible to state more concisely the attitude of the orthodox politician. {343} Which party, indeed, we may well ask, would have fought a general election on anything, however needful, unless it hoped to win on it? \\n\\n \\n\\n MINISTERIAL ATTACKS \\n\\n \\n\\n The attitude of Ministers, however, with regard to Lord Roberts\u0027s speech is much more worthy of remark than that of independent journalists and members of Parliament. For the Government knew several very important things which, at that time, were still hidden from the eyes of ordinary men. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was eight months since Lord Haldane had returned from Germany, concealing, under a smiling countenance and insouciant manner, a great burden of care at his heart. If on his return he spoke cheerily on public platforms about the kindness of his entertainment at Berlin, and of the greatness and goodness of those with whom he had there walked and talked, this was merely in order that his fellow-countrymen might not be plunged in panic or despondency. He had learned the mind of Germany, and it was no light lesson. He had imparted his dreadful secret to his colleagues, and we have learned lately from Mr. Asquith himself what that secret was.... The rulers of Germany, \u0027to put it quite plainly,\u0027 had asked us for a free hand to overbear and dominate the European world, whenever they deemed the opportunity favourable. They had demanded this of the astounded British emissary, \"at a time when Germany was enormously increasing both her aggressive and defensive resources, and especially upon the sea.\" To such a demand but one answer was possible, and that answer the British Government had promptly given—so we are led to infer—in clear and ringing tones of scorn.[11] \\n\\n \\n\\n {344} \\n\\n \\n\\n The Government knew for certain what nobody else did. They knew what the aims of Germany were, and consequently they knew that Lord Roberts had spoken nothing but the truth. \\n\\n \\n\\n And yet, strange to relate, within a few days we find Mr. Runciman, a member of the Cabinet, administering a severe castigation to Lord Roberts. The Manchester speech was \"not only deplorable and pernicious,\u0027 but likewise \u0027dangerous.\u0027 If it was resented in Germany, Mr. Runciman \u0027would like Germany to know that it is resented no less in England....\" Lord Roberts had been a great organiser of the National Service League, the object of which was \u0027practically conscription\u0027; but \"he knows little of England, and certainly little of the North of England, if he imagines we are ever likely to submit to conscription\"—not even apparently (for there are no reservations) as an alternative to conquest; or as a security against murder, arson, and rape.... \"War is only inevitable when statesmen cannot find a way round, or through, difficulties that may arise; or are so wicked that they prefer the hellish method of war to any other method of solution; or are so weak as to allow soldiers, armament makers, or scaremongers to direct their policy.\"[12] Lord Roberts was not, of course, an armament maker, but he was a scaremonger and a soldier, and as such had no right to state his views as to how peace might be kept. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Sir Edward Grey was asked if any representation had been addressed by Germany to the {345} Foreign Office with reference to Lord Roberts\u0027s utterances, he deprecated, with frigid discretion, the idea that either Government should make official representation to the other about \u0027unwise or provocative speeches.\u0027[13] When Sir William Byles plied the Secretary of State for War, Colonel Seely, with questions as to the revocability of Lord Roberts\u0027s pension, the answer was solemn and oracular, but no rebuke was administered to the interrogator.[14] \\n\\n \\n\\n MR. ACLAND\u0027S PERSISTENCY \\n\\n \\n\\n But perhaps the most puzzling thing of all, is the persistency with which Mr. Acland (Sir Edward Grey\u0027s Under-Secretary) pursued Lord Roberts for some three weeks after the rest were finished with him. It might have been expected that Mr. Acland\u0027s chief, who knew \u0027the dreadful secret,\u0027 would have curbed his subordinate\u0027s excess of zeal. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Acland distorted the Manchester speech into an appeal to the British people to put themselves \"in a position to strike at the Germans, and to smash them in a time of profound peace, and without cause.\" And this fanciful gloss he rightly denounces, in accents which remind us not a little of the Reverend Robert Spalding, as \u0027nothing less than a wicked proposal.\u0027[15] ... For England to adopt compulsory military service would be \"an utterly criminal and provocative proceeding against other countries of the world....\" Here, indeed, is much food for wonder. What single country of the world would have regarded the adoption of national service by England as \u0027provocative\u0027? What single country, except Germany, would even have objected to it? And what more right would Germany have had to object {346} to our possessing a formidable army, than we had right to object to her possessing a formidable navy? \\n\\n \\n\\n When some days later Mr. Acland is reproached with having misrepresented Lord Roberts\u0027s original statement, he replies loftily that he \"was justified at the time in supposing that this was his real meaning.\"[16] One wonders why. Lord Roberts had said nothing which any careful reader of his whole speech—an Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, for example, quoting and speaking with a due sense of his great responsibilities—could conceivably have understood to bear this interpretation. \\n\\n \\n\\n A fortnight later Mr. Acland returns to the charge once more. \"Lord Roberts,\" he says courteously, \"has since explained that he did not mean what his words seemed so plainly to mean\"—that is, the smashing of Germany in time of profound peace and without any cause.... Danger to peace, the representative of the Foreign Office assures his audience, \"does not come from any action of His Majesty\u0027s Government. It arises, if at all, from irresponsible utterances such as those which we heard from Lord Roberts. I very much regret that harm must have been done between the two countries by Lord Roberts\u0027s speech.\"[17] \\n\\n \\n\\n Although an under-secretary does not always enjoy the full confidence of his official superior, he would presumably obey orders—even an order to hold his tongue—if any were given. Consequently, although Lord Haldane\u0027s dreadful secret may have been kept from Mr. Acland, as unfit for his innocent {347} and youthful ears, it is surprising that he was never warned of the dangers of the path in which he was so boldly treading. The discourtesies of youth to age are not easily forgiven, especially where they are founded upon misrepresentation, and when, as in this case, the older man was right and the younger wrong as to the facts. \\n\\n \\n\\n LORD ROBERTS WAS RIGHT \\n\\n \\n\\n It will be said—it has indeed been already said—by way of excuse for the reticence of the Government with regard to the intentions, which German statesmen revealed to Lord Haldane, at Berlin, in February 1912—that by keeping back from the country the knowledge which members of the Cabinet possessed, they thereby prevented an outbreak of passion and panic which might have precipitated war. This may be true or untrue; it can neither be proved nor controverted; but at any rate it was not in accordance with the principle of trusting the people; nor would it have prevented the Government and their supporters—when war broke out—from making amends to Lord Roberts and others whom, on grounds of high policy, they had felt themselves obliged, in the past to rebuke unjustly and to discredit without warrant in the facts. This course was not impossible. Peel, a very proud man, made amends to Cobden, and his memory does not stand any the lower for it. \\n\\n \\n\\n With regard to those journalists and private politicians whose mistakes were not altogether their own fault—being due in part at least, to the concealment of the true facts which the Government had practised—it would not have been in the least wounding to their honour to express regret, that they had been unwittingly the means of misleading the people, and traducing those who were endeavouring to lead {348} it right. In their patriotic indignation some of these same journalists and politicians had overstepped the limits of what is justifiable in party polemics. They had attacked the teaching at the Military Colleges, because it sought to face the European situation frankly, and to work out in the lecture-room the strategical and tactical consequences which, in case of war, might be forced upon us by our relations with France and Russia. It would have done these high-minded journalists no harm in the eyes of their fellow-countrymen, had they acknowledged frankly that when in former days they had denounced the words of Lord Roberts as \u0027wicked\u0027 and his interpretation of the situation as inspired by \"the crude lusts and fears which haunt the unimaginative soldier\u0027s brain\"—when they had publicly denounced as \u0027a Staff College Cabal\u0027 teachers who were only doing their duty—they had unwittingly been guilty of a cruel misjudgment. \\n\\n \\n\\n FAILURE TO MAKE AMENDS \\n\\n \\n\\n It is not a little remarkable that in 1912—indeed from 1905 to 1914—Lord Roberts, who, according to the Nation, possessed but \u0027an average Tory intellect,\u0027 should have trusted the people, while a democratic Government could not bring itself to do so. The Cabinet, which knew the full measure of the danger, concealed it out of a mistaken notion of policy. Their henchmen on the platform and in the press did not know the full measure of the danger. They acted either from natural prejudice, or official inspiration—possibly from a mixture of both—when they made light of the danger and held up to scorn any one who called attention to it. The whole body of respectable, word-worshipping, well-to-do Liberals and Conservatives, whom nothing could stir out of {349} their indifference and scepticism, disapproved most strongly of having the word \u0027danger\u0027 so much as mentioned in their presence. The country would to-day forgive all of these their past errors more easily if, when the crisis came, they had acted a manly part and had expressed regret. But never a word of the sort from any of these great public characters! \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] Manchester, October 22, 1912.
