{"id":35379,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI NUGENT O’NEILL.","content":"“He is the toniest aristocrat on the boat.” After we had gone about a quarter of a mile, my companion pulled up. “I think our best chance is to wait here,” he said, “From the way the hounds were running, they are almost certain to come this way eventually.” The road up which we had ridden formed the only pass between the hills on either side of us, and beyond was a low-lying level stretch of country. “If he’ll only run down that way{153}——” Mr. O’Neill began, but suddenly stopped, and silently pointed with his whip to the hill at our right. “What is it?” I asked, in incautiously loud tones. He looked for an instant as if he were going to shake his whip at me, and again pointed, this time to a narrow strip of field beside the road. I saw what looked like a little brown shadow fleeting across it, and in another moment the fox appeared on the top of the wall a few yards ahead of us. He looked about him as if considering his next move, and then, seeing us, he leaped into the road and, running along it, vanished over the crest of the hill. Mr. O’Neill turned to me with such excitement that he seemed a different person. “Here are the hounds!” he said, “and not a soul with them.” Down the hill the pack came like a{154} torrent, and were over the wall in a second. They spread themselves over the road in front of us as if at fault; but one of the little black-and-tan hounds justified Mr. Dennehy’s good opinion by picking up the line, and at once the whole pack were racing full cry up the road. I have often looked back with considerable amusement to that moment. I was suddenly possessed by a kind of frenzy of excitement that deprived me of all power of speech. I heard my companion tell me to keep as close to him as I could, but I was incapable of any response save an inebriated smile and a wholly absurd flourish of my whip. As this does not purport to be a hunting-story, I will not describe the run which followed. I believe it lasted fifteen minutes, and included some of the traditional “big leps” of the country. But to me it was{155} merely an indefinite period of delirious happiness. I scarcely felt Blackthorn jump, and was only conscious of the thud of the big bay horse’s hoofs in front of me and the rushing of the wind in my ears, At last a wood seemed to heave up before me; the bay horse was pulled up sharply, and I found myself almost in the middle of the hounds. “By George! he’s just saved his brush,” said Mr. O’Neill, breathlessly; “he’s gone to ground in there, and I am afraid we shall never get him out. I hope you are none the worse for your gallop,” he continued politely. “It was pretty fast while it lasted.” He dismounted as he spoke, and began to investigate the hole in which the fox had taken refuge, and while he was thus engaged I saw Mr. Dennehy on his yellow horse coming across the next field. When he came up he was, rather to{156} my surprise, amiably pleased at our success in picking up the hounds, and regretted we had not killed our fox. “You two and meself were the only ones in this run,” he said. My thoughts at once reverted to poor Willy. I asked Mr. Dennehy if he had seen anything of him, and heard that he had passed my cousin, slowly making his way home. “Oh, I think I ought to go home at once,” I said to Mr. O’Neill. “I might overtake him if you will tell me where I am to go.” “If you will allow me, I think you had better let me show you the way,” he answered, with a resumption of the stiff manner which had at first struck me. Although I was quite aware that politeness alone prompted this offer, my ignorance of the country made it impossible for me to{157} refuse it. Trusting, however, that by speedily overtaking Willy I should be able to release my unwilling pilot, I wished Mr. Dennehy good morning, and we made the best of our way to the nearest road. Our way lay through what seemed to me a chessboard of absurdly small fields. I could not imagine where all the stones came from that were squandered in the heaping up of the walls that divided them from each other, nor did I greatly care, so long as the necessity of jumping them gave me something to amuse me, and made conversation with Mr. O’Neill disjointed and unexacting. What little I had seen of him at the covert-side had not inspired me with any anxiety to pursue his acquaintance, and once we had got out on to the road, with all the responsibilities of a tête-à-tête staring us in the face, my heart died within me.{158} Never had I met any one who was so difficult to talk to. I found that I was gradually assuming the ungrateful position of a catechist, and, while filled with smothered indignation at my companion’s perfunctory answers, I could not repress a certain admiration for the composure with which he allowed the whole stress of discourse to rest upon my shoulders. I at length made up my mind to give myself no more trouble in the cause of politeness, and resolved that until he chose to speak I would not do so. A long silence was the result. We rode on side by side, my companion staring steadily between his horse’s ears, while I wondered how soon we should be likely to meet Willy, and thought how very much more I should have preferred his society. “I suppose you find this place rather{159} dull?” Mr. O’Neill’s uninterested voice at last broke the silence. “I have always heard that American young ladies had a very gay time.” I at once felt that this insufferable young man was trying to talk down to my level—the level of an “American young lady”—and my smouldering resentment got the better of my politeness. “I very seldom find myself bored by places. It is, as a rule, the people of the place that bore me.” “Really,” he returned, with perfect serenity. “Yes, I dare say that is true; but ladies do not generally get on very well without shop and dances.” “Strange as it may appear, neither of those entrancing occupations are essential to my happiness.” Mr. O’Neill turned and looked at me with faint surprise, but made no reply.{160} Another pause ensued, and I began to repent of my crossness. It was clearly my turn to make the next remark, and I said, in a more conciliatory voice— “I suppose you don’t have very much to do here, either?” “Oh, I am not here very much, and I can always get as much shooting and fishing as I want; but I fancy my sisters find it rather dull.” “Are your sisters fond of music? I was very glad to find a piano at Durrus.” His face assumed for the first time a look of interest. “My elder sister plays a good deal; and Connie has a banjo, though I cannot say she knows much about it; and I play the fiddle a little. I believe in these parts we are considered quite a gifted family.” I felt that I had, so to speak, “struck ile.{161}” “Do you play the violin?” I said, with excitement. “I delight in playing accompaniments! I hope you will bring your music with you when you come to dinner.” “Oh, thanks very much; my sister always accompanies me,” he responded coolly. His deliberate self-possession was infinitely exasperating in my then state of mind, and I repented the enthusiasm that had laid me open to this snub. I was hurriedly framing an effective rejoinder, when he again spoke, this time in tones of considerable amusement. “Do you see that man leading a lame horse down the road? If he is not a chimney-sweep, I think he must be your cousin.” As we came nearer, I was secretly unspeakably tickled by Willy’s inky and{162} bedraggled appearance; but I was too proud to join in Mr. O’Neill’s open amusement, until I noticed for the first time the incongruously rakish effect imparted to Willy’s forlorn figure by the fact that his hat had been crushed in. My injured dignity collapsed, and, holding on to my saddle for support, I laughed till the tears poured down my cheeks. It was at this singularly unpropitious moment that Willy, hearing our horses’ feet, turned round. “Oh, there you are!” he called out. “Did you meet the hounds?” Then, in a voice which showed his good temper had not returned. “You seem to be greatly amused, whatever you did.” I thought it better to ignore the latter part of the sentence, and dashed at once into a confused account of our exploits, Mr. O’Neill helping out my narrative with{163} a few geographical details; to all of which Willy listened with morose attention. “And Blackthorn jumped splendidly, Willy,” I said. “I was so sorry you weren’t there.” “H’m!” said Willy; “very kind of you, I’m sure.” Mr. O’Neill saw that the situation was becoming strained. “As I can’t be of any further help to you or Miss Sarsfield,” he said, “I think I will go back and look for the hounds;” and, wishing us good-bye, he rode off. “Well,” Willy began viciously, “you seem to find O’Neill cheerful enough, after all.” “Indeed, I don’t, Willy,” I said, with vigour; “he was perfectly odious.” “You didn’t look as if you thought him so a while ago, when you were both near falling off your horses with laughing. I{164} suppose”—with sudden penetration—“that it was at me you were laughing.” “Oh no, Willy; at least, it was not exactly you—indeed, it was only your hat.” Even at this supreme moment the air of disreputable gaiety of Willy’s headgear was too much for me, and my voice broke into a hysterical shriek. This was the last straw. With a wrathful glance, he turned his back upon me, and stalked silently on beside Alaska. Blackthorn and I followed meekly in the rear, and in this order we soberly proceeded to Durrus. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2780/76971.html","bookId":1312,"book":{"id":1312,"title":"An Irish Cousin","description":"简介： There had been several days of thick, murky weatherdull, uncomplaining days that bore their burden of fog and rain in monotonous endurance.
