{"id":33859,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER X. COMING HOME.","content":"\"Alice,\" said Robert Streightley to the old nurse, who had kept an anxious watch upon him from the moment she had heard Yeldham\u0027s parting words, \"I want to speak to you. Come upstairs with me to Miss Ellen\u0027s room.\" It was about noon, on the second day after Charles Yeldham reached Paris; and Robert had received his letter, with the enclosure from Katharine, that morning. It had been delivered at the hour which usually found Robert at breakfast, and old Alice in attendance upon him; as in the old time, which had had so brief, so brilliant, and so melancholy an interruption. But on this occasion Robert was alone, by his own express desire; and Alice, too much concerned, too seriously apprehensive to be affronted, had acquiesced without grumbling in his request that she would leave him for a little. No human eye, therefore, had seen Robert\u0027s perusal of his wife\u0027s letter--had witnessed the effect produced on him by such a reversal of his life for the past three years. His heart had known its own bitterness, and neither friend nor stranger was near now to meddle with its joy--a joy too deep for utterance, too supreme almost for endurance--a joy full of keen and piercing pain, of repentance, infinitely more terrible since forgiveness had come, and rich with the divinest blessings of hope. Hours had gone over since the glorious light of this new life had dawned--unheeded hours; and now Robert called to Alice, and she came. As he spoke, the old woman looked at him anxiously, but his face reassured her. It was very pale, and he looked old--he had been looking old of late, she had often thought--but peace, serenity, a calm, which she felt without understanding or questioning, were on the features, and a smile--a sweet and serious smile--lighted them. She followed him without a word to the now disused but always orderly, room which had been Mrs. Dutton\u0027s in her maiden days. It was a pretty, bright, simple apartment, with gay chintz curtains, carefully pinned up now, and covered with holland wrappings; with a bright carpet, covered with its linen shroud; and pretty furniture, simple and inexpensive, but in good taste and in perfect order. The day was bright and clear, and the tireless room, though cold, was not cheerless. Robert glanced round the room, placed a chair for Alice, bade her sit down, and shut the door. Then he set his back against the door, and said: \"Alice, I want you to get this room made ready for a lady as soon as possible.\" \"Lord bless us! Master Robert,\" said the old woman nervously, \"who ever\u0027s coming, and the mistress away, and Miss Ellen not fit to be left, I\u0027m sure--not for a fortnight yet, if so soon----\" \"Alice, dear old woman!\" said Robert, and he bent his tall figure, and laid his hands kindly on her shoulders,--\"it is for my wife. My wife is coming back to me!\" She looked at him with the timid uncertainty of old age, and began to tremble and cry. \"Yes, she\u0027s coming,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t know her, Alice,--you saw her very seldom; you don\u0027t know how good she is----\" \"Good, Master Robert! and stay from you so long, and you in trouble, and so fond of her!\" \"She did not know I was in trouble, nurse; I never told her anything of the kind. She thought I was the same rich man I had been when she left me; and it was all my fault. I cannot explain; but if you love me,--and I know you do, old nurse, I know you do--who so well?--never blame my wife in your heart, or let others blame her in your hearing. But she\u0027s coming back to me; think of that.\" \"When?\" was Alice\u0027s first practical question; \"does my mistress know?\" was her second. \"To-morrow, or the next day, I hope; I am not sure, until I hear again--no, my mother does not know; no one knows. She will come here to me, until I can get a quiet home of our own; then she and I will begin our life again;\" and as Robert spoke the words, he could hardly believe in the meaning they conveyed. Alice had entertained no favourable opinion of Katharine, and had never thought at all of her of late, since she had ceased to be mentioned by Mrs. Streightley. But Robert\u0027s joy acted as a revelation of his sorrow to the faithful friend who watched him more closely, and knew him better than any one in the world beside. She listened, therefore, with the utmost attention to his directions, and promised the closest compliance with his wishes. Every thing should be done to make the house fit for Mrs. Streightley\u0027s reception; little was needed, indeed, but the fires should be lighted and the rooms swept and garnished. Robert thought of the suite of apartments at Portland Place, and of the \"Lady-Kilmantan\" hangings at Middlemeads, but not bitterly; he thought of them, indeed, with a smile: such things mattered little now to him, or to his wife. His wife! He called her by the sacred name, in his thoughts, a thousand times in an hour, and life seemed too short and narrow for all his thankfulness and joy. The news soon spread through the little household, and was received with much indifference. The three female servants who composed the modest establishment were new-comers; they had known nothing of Robert\u0027s wife, and cared nothing about her. But they liked him, and they were rather glad than otherwise that any thing should occur to give him pleasure, more especially as Nurse Alice informed them the \"young madam\u0027s\" residence would be but temporary, for they agreed unanimously that they \"couldn\u0027t abide two mistresses, and in course it was only natural as Mr. Robert\u0027s wife should like to have her own way.\" Thus they set to work with very tolerable activity and good-will, and the work of preparation went on briskly. How the hours of that day passed over Robert Streightley he could not have told, had there been any to question him. Should he write? he had asked himself, when he was once more shut up in the dining-room and secure from interruption. What could he say? To Yeldham he might possibly write a few words of thanks and thankfulness; but what would they avail? what a poor mockery they would be! But perhaps he had better write them. Then the strong man, who had seen his fortunes crumble into dust, and stood upright amid the ruins, took a pen in his hand, and tried to form a few simple words, and he could not do it; darkness gathered before his eyes and his senses reeled. So he went out to the nearest telegraph-office, and he dictated a message to a clerk in three words,--\"Come home quickly;\" and he lingered about until he knew they had been clicked off to Paris, and then he began to count the time as he walked, he hardly knew where, about the clean, frosty suburban roads, and to speculate upon the exact moment when his wife would receive his message. So wandering, while the short hours of the winter\u0027s day were waning, he found himself on the borders of Clapham Common, and leant for a few minutes idly against an iron post, watching the omnibuses starting from the Plough, and their conductors warming themselves by brisk exercise, assisted by strong drink. A narrow road led away to his right; and a little way down, a tall, graceful, lancelike church-spire showed solemn and beautiful against the steel-coloured vault of the sky; the stars were beginning to twinkle, and the leafless trees rustled sharp and brittle in the frosty air. Looking upward at the spire, Robert turned down the narrow road, and found himself in a minute before the low gate and little paved court in front of a modern Gothic church, small, but of rich and correct architecture. The gate swung open as he came up to it, and several children ran gladly out into the road. Through the porch and the heavy oak-door, iron-clamped, and half-open, Robert saw glimpses of the interior of the church, saw gleams of rich colour and bits of quaint Gothic decoration. The grand sonorous tones of an organ swelled out suddenly, and ceased, as he stood idly looking and listening. The notes were the last of the \"practice,\" and accompanied a reiterated \"Amen\" by children\u0027s voices. He passed through the gate into the porch, and, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, entered the church. A great longing for the peace of God had come over him, and here was God\u0027s house; it mattered not to him that the form of the worship therein was Catholic, not that to which he was accustomed, and he went in. There was no light in the church save the red gleam from the sacramental-lamp, swung by long silver chains before the High Altar; the gas-jets which had given light to the organist were turned out as he went into the church, and the children went down the gallery-stairs and trooped noisily away. A man lingered for a few minutes to arrange some chairs piled against the wall of a side aisle, and then departed, having left all in order for the evening service, to commence in an hour. Robert was quite alone: over the large window, high up in the wall, behind which the guests of the Community (for the church was attached to a monastery) were wont to sit and assist unseen at Divine worship, a crimson curtain hung; there was no human eye to witness the emotion of his soul. Robert sat long, absorbed in thought; then he drew near the altar-rail, and kneeled down upon the marble step. The red light shone solemnly upon his kneeling figure, and upon the paintings glowing on the sanctuary-walls. His eyes wandered over these, until they rested upon one, and then they stayed their wandering. It represented a Man of infinitely benign and sorrowful aspect, in whose figure there was great dignity and power. He stood with outstretched arms and piercing gaze directed out from the canvas, as though he looked into the faces of a multitude. A scroll ran round the top of the picture, and bore these words: \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.\" The light was very dim; he could not have read the written words by its glimmer had he needed to read them; but he did not. Kneeling there, on the altar-step, before the face and the words of promise, Robert took his wife\u0027s two letters from his breast, and, like Hezekiah in his trouble, he, in his repentance and his gratitude, \"spread them before the Lord.\" It was late when Robert reached home, and Alice was anxiously expecting him. He was very cheerful, and listened with pleasure to the old woman\u0027s account of all that had been done during the day in the way of preparation for Katharine\u0027s reception. He had several matters of business to attend to; and so the hours wore themselves away; and at length he was the only one waking in the quiet house. \"You\u0027ll go to bed soon, Master Robert,\" old Alice had said to him; \"and you\u0027ll sleep well, I hope, for you\u0027ll not like to be looking ill when Mrs. Streightley comes; and you\u0027re not strong, you know. Promise me, now, that you\u0027ll not sit up.\" So Robert promised, and he fully meant to keep his word; but as the night wore on restlessness came upon him, and distressing pain in the head and eyeballs. He wondered that any illness or pain could come near him, he was so happy so thankful--God had been so good to him, and Katharine was coming home! He could not sleep; no, the effort would be useless; so he made up the fire in the sitting-room, and he walked up and down, trying to tire himself into sleepiness. He had lost command over his thoughts; and though he might not have tried to guide them otherwise than they were going, he felt that he had lost it, and they hurried wildly into the past. All his life seemed to pass before him in a strange phantasmagoria, of which he was but a spectator; and innumerable forgotten scenes, and faces which he had not seen for years, rose up before him,--the first day he had seen Katharine, the day at the Flower-show, the day Mr. Guyon had shown him the letter. Good God, how terrible that recollection was! But she had forgiven him now, and he might fairly try to forgive himself, with this blessed assurance (and he grasped the letter in his breast with his hand as he walked up and down) in his possession, and the certainty of reading a full pardon in her eyes before long. And then he shuddered, shook through all his limbs with the strong contest of emotion, with irrepressible passionate delight and pain. Anon he rose again, and was whirled away upon another storm of thoughts. Mr. Guyon was present to him--the terrible sudden death. Ah, he had taken that too lightly; he had condemned the dead man too hastily and too heavily; the dead man, who had cared for trifles, who had found pleasure in things he could not comprehend, but was no worse than he; the dead man, who loved money and enjoyment, and naught beside. Well, he ought to have pitied him for that--he did pity him, for he was dead. His daughter could not come to him with soft words of peace, and heavenly smiles of pardon, as she was coming to the husband who had wronged her. He did pity the dead old man. He thought how coldly he had looked on the dead face--the rigid, ashy face; he remembered it well, how forlorn and ghastly it was! how awfully alone!--more so than any dead face he had ever seen. And then he remembered how carelessly he had attended the funeral; he had had no thought, no sorrow for the dead; his heart had been rent and wrung with anguish for the loss of Katharine; he had hardly heard the Burial Service at all: he had been glad when it was over, and had turned away to his business and his grief. He remembered some of it now: \"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery.\" Yes, full of misery; but not now, not now--that was over. \"The sure and certain hope\"--this was troubling him; he would read it all through, and try to steady his thoughts upon it. Mrs. Streightley\u0027s \"church-books\" lay upon a shelf near one of the windows. She rarely used the Common Prayer-book, inclining rather to dissenting forms of worship; so Robert found the book without difficulty. He sat down beside the fire, and read the Burial Service throughout, half aloud; and as he concluded it, heavy sleep fell upon him suddenly, as it had done a few times lately since he had not been so strong and well as formerly. He slept on, though the wintry dawn came and the fire died out; and when the housemaid came into the room in the morning, \"it gave her,\" as she described it, \"quite a turn, to see the master a-sittin\u0027 there asleep, and the gas a-burnin\u0027 in the broad daylight.\" Old Alice came bustling in to rouse and scold him; and Robert, feeling very much ashamed of himself, went off sheepishly to bathe and dress. He looked and felt much better after those restoratives, and assured Alice that it had not harmed him to sleep on a chair instead of his bed; he felt just a little giddy of course, but it was nothing, he told her. He told himself it was the expectation of the post-hour, and the news it would bring. He did not venture to ask Alice to leave him to breakfast alone this morning; so the old woman was in the room when the expected letter arrived. It was very short; and with his first glance at it, he said: \"She will be here this evening, Alice; she comes by the day-mail.\" \"Thank God!\" said the old woman fervently. \"I am thankful there\u0027s to be no more waiting; for you ain\u0027t fit for it, Robert, my boy, and that\u0027s the truth.\" \"The train comes in at six; she will be here before seven. Mr. Yeldham is coming with her. Is every thing ready, Alice?\" \"Every thing, Master Robert. I will have the fire lighted in her room immediately, and the things all put straight; and then you can look at it, and satisfy yourself. And you won\u0027t worry yourself--will you promise me not to worry yourself?\" \"I worry myself!--no, indeed, nurse. I think that nothing can ever harm or grieve or \u0027worry\u0027 me, as you call it, any more.\" Then he told her he must go into the City for an hour or two: and he took a kind leave of her and went. The old woman sat down on the chair he had vacated, and burst into an unaccountable fit of crying. \"I am an old fool, to be sure, if ever there was one!\" she said irritably, after a few minutes; \"but I can\u0027t help it--there\u0027s something over me, though I\u0027m glad for my dear boy. Now that that\u0027s over, I\u0027ll go and look after those girls, and see what\u0027s best to have for her dinner.\" It was nearly four o\u0027clock when Robert returned; and he came in a cab which looked like a small conservatory on wheels, for every available space in it was filled with flowers. He carried the pots and the bouquets carefully into the house; and having assured Alice that he was not hungry--for her anxiety on that point had not slumbered since his infancy--he asked her if the rooms upstairs were ready. \"I have just come down from looking after them myself, Master Robert; and nothing could be prettier nor nicer.\" \"Well, nurse, help me to take these flowers upstairs, and show me all your beautiful decorations.\" Alice was right: nothing nicer or prettier than the room prepared for Katharine could be seen. A bright fire burned in the polished grate, and a soft white lambskin rug lay before the fender; the chintz curtains shaded the windows cosily, and the uncovered carpet looked fresh and gay; the simple furniture was tastefully disposed; and a low velvet chair, borrowed from the drawing-room, stood invitingly before the fire. Ellen had been fond of flowers, and some pretty Parian vases were among the ornaments of her forsaken chamber. Aided by Alice, Robert arranged the flowers he had brought--and which, though numerous, were not various, for even money will not avail to procure floral variety in December--and disposed the vases as his taste dictated. Then they set the flower-pots in the balcony, and looked round approvingly on their completed task. The two faithful friends stood a while in silence, and then Robert said, \"Is all ready downstairs as well?\" \"All ready, my dear; and not long to wait now, God be praised! What are you going to do--not going to the station to meet them surely, are you?\" \"O no, nurse--I\u0027m going to wait for her here; and I want you to take care that I\u0027m not disturbed. I have a great deal to think about, Alice, and I want to be alone now until she comes.\" \"Very well, Robert; no one shall come near you. What time is it now?\" \"Half-past four. Have plenty of light downstairs, that the house may look cheerful when she comes; and, Alice, I will light the gas here now, so shut the shutters.\" He went with her to one of the windows to aid her, and they looked out. The red wintry sun was going down in a fiery ball, and red streaks were lying low upon the sky. \"They have had a pleasant journey, no doubt,\" said Alice cheerfully; \"and they\u0027re on the sea now, I suppose.\" Robert made her no answer: he was looking at the sunset, a fold of the shutter in each hand. He closed them together, fastened the bolt, and drew the curtains, while Alice lighted the gas-lamps. His face was very pale, but there was a smile of exultation and delight upon it. He spoke aloud, forgetting his reticence in his joy: \"The last sun has set that I shall see rise without her. All my troubles are over, nurse.\" The old woman went up to him, gently lifted her arms, and drew his face down towards her own. She kissed him fondly more than once, and said in a low broken tone, \"God bless you, my darling boy! Don\u0027t forget the Lord, who has granted you your heart\u0027s desire.\" Then she left the room quickly, and went downstairs, wiping her eyes with her apron. After a few minutes Robert went into the adjoining room, and returned, carrying a large leather box. He set it upon a small table, near the toilet, and opened it with a key attached to his watch-chain. Then he took from it several cases, which he arranged symmetrically on the dressing-table, opening each, and displaying its contents. \"Yes,\" he murmured; \"I am sure it was in just such order they lay that night when she put on the bracelet when I asked her, and put her hand in mine. The amethysts here, and the opal cross beside the pincushion, and the diamonds there.\" And he placed them as he spoke. The diamond serpent came to his hand last, and he held it, turning it to the light and watching the flashes of rich colour which gleamed from the gems. Then he replaced it in its satin case, and laid it upon the stand of the toilet-mirror. \"Yes, my darling,\" he murmured, \"they are beautiful, and worth much money; and I have wanted money sorely since you adorned them last and turned from them with disdain; but I would have starved, I think, before I could have parted with them, for they had touched you.\" He sat down in the velvet chair by the fire, took something from his waistcoat-pocket, and held it towards the light on his open palm. It was a plain gold ring, and a date was engraved inside it. It was that of the day then passing into evening, and he had had it done that morning. \"This is the true symbol,\" he murmured, \"she will wear this willingly.\" He sat for many minutes gazing at the ring upon his outstretched hand; then he put it back into his pocket, and started up. A quarter to six. Later than he had thought, than he had hoped. His thoughts were confused. Now they were hurrying him away again. This must not be. In this supreme hour of his life there must be no vagueness; he must rule his mind. But how? Her letter--he would read her letter--yes, that would reassure him, would restore his composure. A horrid feeling of unreality was creeping over him. This was not a dream, surely? Katharine his wife was really coming--this was her room. The fire and light were real; the doors of yonder wardrobe were lying open to receive her dresses, and the jewels upon the table there were hers--she had worn them. He was really standing in the midst of objects which assured him all was true. Then why had he felt for a moment a wide cold barren heath around him, and seen the sky and the stars? They were shut out, and there was no picture upon the wall opposite? Of course not. There was no picture there; he was only remembering the picture he had seen yesterday. He would read her letter, and he would read it on his knees, and remain kneeling until he should hear the sound of wheels--and then? How painful the slow heavy beating of his heart grew! It quite confused him. He would be much easier kneeling down. He crossed the room to the low white bed, touching the table with his hand for a moment, and knelt down on the side of the bed which faced the door. He took Katharine\u0027s letter from his breast, spread it open on the coverlet, stretching his arms out round it, like a frame. He was steadier now--that strange hurry had passed away. This was the letter:-- \"I wrote to you three years ago, on the day after my father died; and I then believed, and intended what I said, that that should be the last communication I would ever hold with you. I left you, full of anger and revenge, full of self-contempt that I had permitted myself to be deceived, and with no thought beyond myself, my injuries, and my vengeance. From that day I never heard your name spoken, or was recalled by any outward circumstance to the recollection of the life I had forsaken, until a few days ago; and the letter I am now writing to you, Robert, is the result of what I then accidentally learned. \"The knowledge I have gained is the knowledge of your loss of fortune--ruin. The person who mentioned it called it in the strong phrase natural to those who love wealth best, and value it above all. I hope it is not so bad as this; but whatever it be, you are what the world I lived in once, but which has forgotten me, and which I have forgotten, calls a poor man. Thus the great barrier which did exist between you and me exists no longer, and I can address you as frankly and as freely as I will, with my whole heart. You may have ceased to love me, you may not care for my pardon now; but at least you cannot say I am tired of obscurity and poverty, and would return to my former position of wealth and luxury as your wife. Neither you nor the world, if it should ever know any thing of me again,--nor even my own proud self-doubting heart, which has so often tortured me with suggestions of deceitful motives,--can whisper that I have any purpose but the right to serve in this. \"I have suffered and learned since I left you, Robert. That suffering has been good for me, and that learning has changed me; so that I have often wished to do that which I am now doing, but have been held back by pride. For I am asking you to take me back; I am asking you to give me once more the place in your home and in your life which I wilfully, in my blind wrath, abandoned. The wrong you did me I have long ago forgiven; will you forgive me the wrong I have done you? I never understood it aright until I knew that your fortunes had fallen, until I knew that you, too, had lapsed out of your place in the world; and then, though you never cared for these things as I cared for them, I came to understand what I had done to you. You hid all your troubles from me; you kept a cheerful face to me when your heart was sad; and you allowed me to lavish money when it was melting out of your hands; you never found a fault with me, or denied a wish of mine its most ample gratification. Foolish, vain, worthless wishes they were, and I think of them with shame; but I remember your forbearance, your generosity, your constant kindness with gratitude, which is no new feeling, for I have been learning life\u0027s lessons for a long time in silence and loneliness; and if I could have conquered my pride, if I could have known above all what I know now, I should long ago have told you this. What am I, that I should be relentless to you? what am I, that I should not forgive? I never fulfilled a wife\u0027s duties; I never understood them; no one ever tried to teach me but one, and I set my headstrong will against her. I left you to sorrow and perplexity, to humiliation, and to ruin; I, who had enjoyed your wealth, and had married you without love. Your sin was not greater in reality than mine, Robert. I wonder can any sin be really greater than a marriage without love? But I was implacable to you, and you never complained of me. We lived together, the one a mystery for the other, each a lie to ourselves, and there was no confidence between us, and in me no forbearance. God help me, I was ignorant indeed; and it was not until I had become a lonely looker-on at life that I learned the lessons which earlier might have saved both you and me. \"I soon forgave you, Robert; but I have never been able to forgive myself. Perhaps when you have forgiven me, as I know you will, peace will come to me. External quiet I have had, but not peace, though it took me long to learn that I was seeking a vain shadow, under that name, and that in doing the right alone can any human being ever find it. In the day when self-delusion fell away from me, it left me as lonely as I had left you; and there was no possibility of substituting self-made duties for those which God\u0027s law and my own vow had laid upon me, and which I had forsaken. If you have been unhappy--and, little as I know you, in comparison with the comprehension which a wife\u0027s ought to be, I know you well enough to feel only too sure that you have been unhappy--my life has had no joy in it, no serenity. All that ever pleased me in the past has utterly lost its charm. God has had too much compassion on me to suffer me to say, \u0027Peace, peace, when there is no peace;\u0027 and now the end of the struggle has come. Careless words spoken by a stranger have been a revelation to me. You have sought for me in vain, Robert; then you desire to find me? Is it that you love me still, as you loved me in those evil days when I so ill requited your love? Or is it because you too would expiate the past for God\u0027s sake and the right? Whatever be your motive, there is but one course for me--the course I am taking. If you will receive me, I am ready to return to you whenever you shall summon me. \"Do you remember Dr. Hudson, who attended me at Martigny after our marriage? He has been a true and untiring friend to me. Nobly has he redeemed the unasked pledge of fidelity which he gave me when we parted there. I sought him out when I left you, and he has taken care of me ever since. Part of the time I lived in a convent, and was permitted to work among the poor and the sick; but of late I have been living with Dr. Hudson\u0027s mother in Brittany. This is a brief history of a long time. If you can forgive me, and bid me come home, I will tell you all the story of my outwardly quiet life, and you shall; tell me yours. We are husband and wife, Robert; and yet what strangers we are to each other! I wonder if you are as much changed as I am. Since I have known that you have had other heavy griefs besides those which I laid upon you, I dread to think how they may have altered you. Let me help you to bear them now--I, who never before touched your burdens with so much as a finger--let me be to you in adversity what in prosperity I did not care, did not know how to be. Let our dead past bury its dead. Life must always be sad and serious, I think, to those who are neither foolish nor wicked; and it will be always sad and serious to us. There are shadows cast from the time that is gone upon our paths, which no light can wholly dissipate, until we emerge into the perfect day; but the shades of anger and resentment are not among them: they have vanished, and can never come again. I do not know where your home is, Robert, and I must direct this letter to your mother\u0027s house; but wherever and whatever it may be, I entreat you let me share it. Let me come to you, late as it is, and keep my vow to you, so long and so wilfully broken, \u0027until death do us part.\u0027 \"Katharine Streightley.\" A quarter-past six. The hour chimed gaily with a treble ring from the little French clock on the mantelpiece. The fire was burning steadily, as fires burn in cheerful frosty weather; the delicate scent of the flowers had come out under the genial influence of the warmth, and dispersed itself through the room. The sharp roll of cab and carriage wheels upon the road came deadened through the closed windows. Robert still knelt beside the bed, and still framed his wife\u0027s letter with his outstretched arms. The stir of expectation and preparation was audible downstairs. The dining-room door stood invitingly open, the fights burned brightly, the table was laid for three, and the snowy tablecloth and glittering glass looked not the least attractive among the items of the welcome prepared for the travellers. The little hall was lighted too, and the very porcelain tiles seemed to have been brightened for the occasion. Half-past six. Alice comes upstairs from the kitchen, opens the hall-door, and listens. The keen air comes in, but the old woman is not afraid of the keen air, and there is no wind. Soon she goes to the stair-head and calls,---- \"Susan, your clock is slow. The down-train is just leaving the junction. They\u0027ll be here directly.\" Susan answers from the bottom of the short staircase: \"Let \u0027em come. Dinner is all ready, and I doubt it\u0027ll be spoiled, if they don\u0027t come soon, by the time they\u0027ve got their things off. Where\u0027s master?\" \"In Miss Ellen\u0027s room; he\u0027s not to be disturbed till they come. O, he\u0027ll hear \u0027em fast enough. There, it\u0027s gone the quarter!\" Alice comes back to the door, and holding it a little ajar, continues to peep out. Many trains from distant places arrive about this hour, and she is disappointed several times by cabs, luggage-laden, which pass the gate. \"I\u0027ve often heard Master Robert say a quarter of an hour should always be allowed for them foreign trains,\" the old woman mutters a little impatiently; \"but surely they\u0027ll soon be here. He\u0027ll be worn out with waiting.\" Seven! They are here. A cab stops at the gate, and Alice calls excitedly to the servants, Susan cannot abandon the dinner, but the others come and concern themselves about the luggage, while she opens wide the door, and a lady and gentleman enter. \"Well, nurse,\" says Mr. Yeldham in an excited voice, \"you see I have brought Mrs. Streightley home.\" \"I see, sir,\" says Alice, trembling. \"God bless you, ma\u0027am; and welcome home a thousand times!\" Katharine puts out her hand hurriedly, and takes the old woman\u0027s; but she does not speak. She is very pale, and her lips are trembling; but she is very, very beautiful. Alice is startled at her beauty. She looks like a queen, she thinks; her deep-mourning dress drapes her like robes. But she has only time for a glimpse of Katharine, for Yeldham leads her quickly into the dining-room, whence he comes out in a moment, and asks Alice, still in the hall, and watching the servants and the cabman carrying the luggage up the little garden walk, \"Where\u0027s Robert?\" Alice explains that he is in the room prepared for Mrs. Streightley, but wonders he has not heard the cab, and is bustling towards the stairs to call him, when Yeldham stops her. \"No, nurse; I know the room. I\u0027ll take her to him.\" So he calls Katharine, and she comes quickly; and they go up the stairs together, Alice following. There is light on each landing, and they are soon at the door. Yeldham taps rapidly, and at the same time turns the door-handle; and Katharine, with a swift steady step, passes into the room, into the glow of the light and the warmth and the perfume of the flowers. She sees it all with one quick happy glance; sees the jewels on the table, and recognises them; sees the light glancing upon the scales of the diamond serpent; sees the outstretched arms upon the bed, and the head now laid down upon them. In a moment she is beside the kneeling figure, her hand upon the shoulder, her breath upon the thick brown curls. \"Robert! I have come--I am here!\" There is no answer. The breathless listeners on the landing hear no sound of glad welcome. An instant, and a faint gasping cry reaches them; for Katharine has knelt beside her husband, and lifted his head from off his outstretched arms, and it has swayed helplessly, and fallen heavily against her bosom. Death has parted them! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2762/76237.html","bookId":1340,"book":{"id":1340,"title":"Kissing the Rod.","description":"简介： There was no name on the doorposts, nothing beyond the number--48--to serve as a guide; and yet it may be doubted whether any firm in the City was better known to the postman, the bankers\u0027-clerks, and all who had regular business to transact with the...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2762","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:53 AM"}}
